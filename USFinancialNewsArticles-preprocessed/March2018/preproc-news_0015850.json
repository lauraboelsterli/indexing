Due to the efforts of our outstanding team, we were able to overcome much of the one-time extraordinary expenses incurred earlier in the year to end 2017 in a very positive way. We see the velocity of our business as measured by sales activity to be increasing substantially.” said Jeff Brown, President and CEO. “Both our “Protect” and “Connect” solution sets showed good momentum to close out the year. We have had great customer feedback and interest in the SMC Cloud solution which we rolled out toward the end of the year. In this segment, not only are we offering data visualization and analytics in support of the IIoT market segment, we are adding intelligence to our gateway products to bring Edge computing power to our customers. This combined with our ability to collect and store massive amounts of data for our customers lets us help them to be more efficient and cost effective for their end users. We continue to invest in expanding and improving our product lines to better meet market needs and price points as well as increasing our capabilities to deliver solutions. As previously disclosed, while we considered a potential strategic transaction during 2017, we ultimately determined that such transaction would not be in the best interest of the company. We will, however, continue to evaluate all opportunities to increase shareholder value including expanding our sales and profitability as well as reviewing alternative strategic opportunities.”\nSierra Monitor continued to retain and expand its two hundred strong Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) customer base for its FieldServer protocol gateway products which also allow customers to integrate to Building Automation and gateway to the cloud. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) segment as defined by cloud connectivity, as well as Sierra Monitor’s Sentry IT line of flame and gas monitoring solutions continued to be selected by industry leaders across segments to protect their valuable assets. A few examples of these customers include:\n● A large municipality in Southern California has selected and is deploying Sierra Monitor gas detectors and controllers to monitor various parts of their transit system. This includes both bus and metro facilities. ● A European manufacturer of high-quality components for heating, plumbing, air conditioning, heat metering and renewable systems launched an advanced electronically controlled point-of-distribution digital mixing valve for commercial hot water systems. With advanced features such as scheduled thermal disinfection for preventing bacterial growth, the valve is an important new product in this segment of the market. Sierra Monitor’s FieldServer gateway solution was selected because of its ease of integration into building management solutions while providing a great deal of flexibility including multi-protocol support, wired and wireless networking options and access to cloud features. ● SMC was selected to provide gas detection for the first nuclear power plant in the United Arab Emirates. The facility in Barakah, UAE, has four power plants which will supply up to 25% of the UAE’s electricity needs by 2020. As part of the overall safety program, SMC will provide gas controllers and H2S, CO, CO2 and O2 gas detectors. ● Chromalox, a leading producer of leak detection equipment, chose Sierra Monitor’s solution because of ease of integration of multiple products into a single gateway solution from SMC allowing them much greater flexibility in the marketplace. ● Sigma Controls selected Sierra Monitor’s solution allowing them to connect to building management solutions but also to send their data to the cloud and monitor the health of their systems remotely.

The following tables reconcile the non-GAAP financial measures used to the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, and basic and diluted non-GAAP net income per share.\nSierra Monitor continues to provide all information required in accordance with GAAP and does not suggest or believe non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. Sierra Monitor believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its operating results primarily because they exclude amounts the company does not consider part of ongoing operating results when assessing overall company performance.\nWe believe that our non-GAAP financial measures facilitate the comparison of results for current periods with results for past periods. We exclude the following items from non-GAAP financial measures:\nDepreciation and Amortization of Tangible and Intangible Assets\nIn accordance with GAAP, depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets includes depreciation of purchased capital assets and amortization of intangible assets including third party approval fees. We exclude these amounts from our internal measures for budget and planning purposes.\nProvision for Bad Debt Expense\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which is analyzed on a periodic basis to ensure that it is adequate to the best of management’s knowledge. We exclude these amounts from our internal measures for budget and planning purposes.\nProvision for Inventory Losses\nWe evaluate our inventories for excess or obsolescence on a quarterly basis. Inventories identified as slow moving or obsolete are determined based on historical experience and current product demand. The quarterly analysis is used to adjust the provision for inventory losses. We exclude the provision for inventory losses from our internal measures for budget and planning purposes.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nThe effect of changes in deferred tax balances is non-cash and is not comparable across periods or with other companies. We exclude these amounts from our internal measures for budget and planning purposes.\nStock-based Compensation Expense\nOur non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation expenses, which consist of expenses for stock options, restricted stock and any other applicable equity awards that are issued. While stock-based compensation is an expense affecting our results of operations, management excludes stock-based compensation from our budget and planning process. For these reasons we exclude stock-based compensation expenses from our non-GAAP financial measures. We compute weighted average dilutive stocks using the methods required by GAAP for both GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per share.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA represents net earnings attributable to Sierra Monitor excluding interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. As required by SEC rules, we have provided reconciliation on Table D of this measure to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that EBITDA is one of the appropriate measures for evaluating the operating performance of the company because it reflects the resources available for strategic opportunities including, among others, to invest in the business, strengthen the balance sheet, and make strategic acquisitions.\nSierra Monitor refers to these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating and measuring the performance of our ongoing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate our internal comparisons to historical operating results. We are reporting non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting. We compute non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nSierra Monitor believes that non-GAAP measures have significant limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Sierra Monitor’s financial results as determined in accordance with GAAP and that these measures should only be used to evaluate Sierra Monitor’s financial results in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, and the financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated. Because of these limitations, Sierra Monitor qualifies the use of non-GAAP financial information in a statement when non-GAAP information is presented. In addition, the exclusion of the charges and expenses indicated above from the non-GAAP financial measures presented does not indicate an expectation by Sierra Monitor management that similar charges and expenses will not be incurred in subsequent periods.\nTable C SIERRA MONITOR CORPORATION Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Operating Results\n(Unaudited) For the three months ended\nDecember 31, For the twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP Net (Loss) Income $ (10,767 ) $ (42,743 ) $ (377,596 ) $ (90,932 ) Adjustments: Depreciation and amortization 65,369 79,436 272,720 342,002 Provision for bad debt expense - (3,826 ) - (3,826 ) Provision for inventory losses (97,109 ) (9,052 ) (97,109 ) (463 ) Deferred income taxes 34,842 (17,020 ) 34,842 (17,020 ) Stock based compensation expense 69,632 89,095 299,665 375,827 Total adjustments to GAAP net income 72,734 138,633 510,118 696,520 Non-GAAP Net Income $ 61,967 $ 95,890 $ 132,522 $ 605,588 Non GAAP Net Income Per Share: Basic $ 0.01 $ 0.01 $ 0.01 $ 0.06 Diluted $ 0.01 $ 0.01 $ 0.01 $ 0.06 Weighted-average number of shares used in per share computations: Basic 10,190,625 10,152,134 10,186,215 10,147,430 Diluted 10,269,056 10,152,134 10,222,163 10,147,430\nTable D SIERRA MONITOR CORPORATION Reconciliation of GAAP to EBITDA Operating Results (Unaudited)\nFor the three months ended\nDecember 31, For the twelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP Net Loss $ (10,767 ) $ (42,743 ) $ (377,596 ) $ (90,932 ) Interest Income (312 ) (133 ) (481 ) (621 ) Income Tax Provision 118,731 7,535 38,695 166,653 Depreciation and amortization 65,369 79,436 272,720 342,002 Non-GAAP EBITDA $ 173,021 $ 44,095 $ (66,662 ) $ 417,102\nSource:Sierra Monitor Corporation",
