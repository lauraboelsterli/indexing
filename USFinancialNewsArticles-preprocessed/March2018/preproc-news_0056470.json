(\"Overstock\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: OSTK) and certain of its officers, on behalf of shareholders who purchased Overstock securities between August 3, 2017 and March 26, 2018, inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm's site: http://www.bgandg.com/ostk .\nThis class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws.\nThe complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Overstock's coin offering was highly problematic and potentially illegal; and (2) the Company's Medici business was hemorrhaging money.\nOn March 1, 2018, Overstock revealed that the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") had requested information about its initial coin offering. Following this news, Overstock stock dropped 4.4% to $57.75 per share.\nThen, on March 15, 2018, Overstock announced that \"the investigation could result in a delay of the tZero security token offering, negative publicity for tZero or us, and may have a material adverse effect on us or on the current and future business ventures of tZero.\" Overstock also said that the SEC was examining the advisers at tZero. It was also revealed that Medici had lost $22 million in 2017, despite the fact that Bitcoin prices increased by 1,375% during that time.
