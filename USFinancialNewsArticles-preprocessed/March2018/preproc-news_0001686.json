    "text": "ATLANTA, March 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WestRock Company (NYSE:WRK) today announced that it has priced $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.750% senior notes due 2025 and $600 million aggregate principal amount of 4.000% senior notes due 2028. The notes will be guaranteed by certain WestRock subsidiaries.\nWestRock intends to use the net proceeds of the offering to finance a portion of the consideration for the proposed acquisition of KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation (the \"Acquisition\"), to pay transaction fees and expenses and for general corporate purposes. Pending the closing of the Acquisition, WestRock may use the net proceeds from the offering to repay, or in lieu of, borrowings under WestRock's term loan facilities, revolving facilities, receivables facility and/or commercial paper program. If WestRock does not consummate the Acquisition, WestRock intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of indebtedness. The offering is expected to close on March 6, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nThe notes and the guarantees have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. As a result, the notes may not be offered or sold within the United States to or for the account or benefit of any U.S. person unless the offer or sale would qualify for a registration exemption under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the notes are being offered only to qualified institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain persons outside the United States in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nThis press release will not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of, the notes or the guarantees in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis release contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current views and assumptions and are typically identified by words or phrases such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"would,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"project,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"target,\" \"prospects,\" \"potential\" and \"forecast,\" and other words, terms and phrases of similar meaning.
