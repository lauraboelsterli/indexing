    "text": "TORONTO, March 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nitinat Minerals Corporation (the “Corporation”) (TSX VENTURE:NZZ) (FRANKFURT:04U1) is pleased to announce that it has entered into an option agreement (the “Agreement”) with two arm’s length parties (collectively, the “Optionors”) whereby the Corporation has obtained the option to acquire an 100% undivided interest in four (4) additional claims (collectively, the “Claims”) abutting the western boundaries of the Corporation’s current mining claims in Carscallen Township, Ontario.\nPursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the Corporation is required to pay the Optionors an aggregate of $65,000 and issue an aggregate of 1 million common shares (the “Consideration Shares”) in the capital of the Corporation on or before January 10, 2020. The issuance of the Consideration Shares is subject to the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange and will be subject to a statutory four (4) month hold period from date of issuance.\nIn the event that the Corporation exercises its option and acquires the Claims, the Corporation’s current property holdings will more than quadruple in size. The Claims encompass an area of particular interest in that surface exploration conducted on the Claims to date have shown the existence of historic surface mining.\n“The Corporation is very excited to have secured an option to acquire the Claims,” stated Herb Brugh, the President of the Corporation. “The Option represents the first time that all of the claims have been under the control of a singular company. The Claims represent an incredible opportunity for the Corporation as they have never been drilled and by the Claims abutting the Corporation’s current claims, makes the claim contiguous which lends itself for a more concise work program. The Corporation intends to develop an extensive work program to fully investigate the potential of the Claims.”\nThe Carscallen Gold Property is located 25 kms west of the City of Timmins and 7 kilometers north of the Lakeshore Gold’s Timmins Mine which produced an aggregate of 185,600 ounces in 2014.\nThe Qualified Person for the Carscallen Property is John A. Gould, B.Sc. University of the Witwatersrand (Geology, Physics and Chemistry) Potchefstroom University of Higher Christian Education: BSc (Hons) (Geology) SACNASP Registration: 400022/10.\nCorporation contact:\nHerb Brugh, President and Director\nTel: 416.216.0964\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis news release contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and applicable Canadian securities legislation.
