    "text": "PROVIDENCE, R.I., March 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Modern Pod Company is delighted to announce expanding distribution across the country for its flagship Hummus Pod® program. Hummus Pods are the delicious, better-for-you, hand-held snacketizers that deliver hummus a whole new way. New retailers include Whole Foods Markets, Hannaford, Earth Fare, and a range of enlightened independents, drawing from an expanded UNFI warehouse footprint. Pods are now available in the frozen aisle in over 2,500 retail locations .\nHummus Pods have also secured Non-GMO Project Verification for the original Pod flavors – Zesty Lemon, Sriracha Lime, and Smoky Chipotle. Made from premium ingredients, Pods are crispy chewy multigrain shells encapsulating creamy, boldly seasoned hummus. Better-for-you, plant-based, real food ingredients are at the core of the Modern Pod Company's mission. Pods feature Extra-Virgin Olive Oil, premium US chickpeas, and wholesome ancient grains like teff and quinoa – with nothing artificial. They are a good source of fiber and protein, and are just 150 calories per three pod serving. \"We've selected the best ingredients from the start, to create the best plant-based experience on the planet,\" comments Becky McCartin, a Modern Pod Product Developer.\nAnd The Modern Pod Company is delighted to announce the appointment of Levon Kurkjian, a seasoned food industry executive, as General Manager.
