    "text": "BOULOGNE-BILLANCOURT, France--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News:\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180315005988/en/\nCarrefour (Paris:CA), one of the global leaders in food retail, announced today it has acquired a majority stake in the start-up Quitoque, leader of meal kit deliveries, and one of the French pioneers in Foodtech.\nCreated in 2014, Quitoque is the French leader in meal kits delivered at home. Through a subscription system, it offers each week varied and healthy recipes to be prepared at home with local, organic and seasonal products. Quitoque pays particular attention to the quality, freshness and taste of its products by favouring those of French origin. In 2017, the company, which has 60 employees, delivered nearly 3 million meals throughout France. Following the transaction, effective today, Quitoque will remain managed by its co-founders who will continue to develop the company alongside Carrefour.\nThis investment allows Carrefour to expand its food e-commerce offering. It is fully in line with the Group’s ambition of creating an omnichannel universe of reference and becoming the world leader in the food transition for all.\n“Carrefour constantly strives to be closer to its customers and to enrich the shopping experience by offering innovative services that simplify everyday shopping. At the crossroads of digital and food, Quitoque will enable us to strengthen our position in the Foodtech industry in order to provide an omnichannel response to new consumer habits through the combination of proximity, convenience and quality” said Marie Cheval, Executive Director Customers, Services and Digital Transformation at Carrefour.\nAccording to Etienne Boix, co-founder of Quitoque: “This transaction confirms the relevance of our model and will enable us to capitalize on Carrefour’s strengths to accelerate our omnichannel development”.",
