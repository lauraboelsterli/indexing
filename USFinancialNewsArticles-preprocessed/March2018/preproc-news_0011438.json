    "text": "Revenue of $76.9 million for the quarter, up 8% sequentially High Speed Products represented 84% of total revenue for the quarter\nSAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- NeoPhotonics Corporation (NYSE: NPTN), a leading designer and manufacturer of optoelectronic solutions for the highest speed communications networks in telecom and data center applications, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\n“In the fourth quarter, NeoPhotonics delivered solid revenue of $76.9 million, representing 8% growth over the prior quarter, while continuing to focus on reducing inventory and operating expenses. Driving this growth was a combination of increasing demand from our Chinese customers, where we believe customer inventory levels have normalized for our products, and stable demand in the other regions we serve,” said Tim Jenks, Chairman and CEO of NeoPhotonics. “We are seeing design win strength in our new 400G and 600G product offerings across all three of our leading components as well as with our CFP-DCO and Multi-Cast Switch modules. While continuing uncertainty around the timing of provincial and 5G trial tenders within China may overshadow growth from our new products in the short term, we believe the mid- and long-term market drivers for our business are compelling,” concluded Mr. Jenks.\nFourth Quarter Summary\nRevenue was $76.9 million, an 8% increase from the prior quarter Gross margin was 20.4%, compared to 14.8% in the prior quarter Non-GAAP Gross margin was 21.3%, compared to 18.6% in the prior quarter Net loss was $14.3 million, compared to a net loss of $18.2 million in the prior quarter Non-GAAP net loss was $11.7 million, compared to a net loss of $10.9 million in the prior quarter Diluted net loss per share was $0.32, in comparison to a net loss of $0.42 per share in the prior quarter Non-GAAP diluted net loss per share was $0.27, compared to a net loss of $0.25 in the prior quarter Adjusted EBITDA was negative $0.4 million, compared to negative $4.5 million in the prior quarter\nNon-GAAP results in the fourth quarter of 2017 exclude $0.2 million of asset sale related costs and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, $2.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, $0.2 million of gain on asset sales and $0.6 million of restructuring charges. A reconciliation of the Non-GAAP and Adjusted EBITDA financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is provided in the financial schedules portion at the end of this press release.\nAnnual Summary\nRevenue in 2017 was $292.9 million, compared to $411.4 million in 2016 Gross margin was 21.0%, compared to 28.5% in 2016 Non-GAAP Gross margin was 22.5%, compared to 29.9% in 2016 Net loss for the full year was $53.3 million, compared to a net loss of $0.2 million in 2016 Non-GAAP net loss for the full year was $39.9 million, compared to net income of $23.0 million in 2016 Diluted net loss per share was $1.23, compared to a breakeven in 2016 Non-GAAP diluted net loss per share was $0.92, compared to earnings of $0.50 in 2016 Adjusted EBITDA was negative $10.1 million, compared to positive $45.1 million in 2016\nNon-GAAP results in fiscal 2017 exclude $1.5 million of asset sale related costs and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, $8.2 million of stock-based compensation expense, $2.2 million of gain on asset sales and $6.7 million of restructuring and litigation charges and end-of-life inventory write-downs. A reconciliation of the Non-GAAP and Adjusted EBITDA financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is provided in the financial schedules portion at the end of this press release.\nAs of December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash, together totaled $93.9 million, compared to $73.7 million at September 30, 2017. Restricted cash as of December 31, 2017 was $2.7 million, down from $2.9 million at September 30, 2017.\nOutlook for the Quarter Ending March 31, 2018\nGAAP Non-GAAP Revenue $67 to $73 million Gross Margin 15% to 19% 16% to 20% Operating Expenses $26 to $27 million $23 to $24 million Earnings per share $0.40 to $0.30 net loss $0.32 to $0.22 net loss The Non-GAAP outlook for the first quarter of 2018 excludes the impact of expected amortization of intangibles of approximately $0.3 million, the anticipated impact of stock-based compensation of approximately $3.1 million, of which $0.6 million is estimated for cost of goods sold and $0.1 million for the expected impact of restructuring charges.\nNon-GAAP and Adjusted EBITDA Measures vs. GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company’s non-GAAP and adjusted EBITDA measures exclude certain GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of the Non-GAAP and Adjusted EBITDA financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is provided in the financial schedules portion at the end of this press release. These non-GAAP financial measures differ from GAAP measures with the same captions and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar captions that are used by other companies. As such, these non-GAAP measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures to analyze its operating performance and future prospects, develop internal budgets and financial goals, and to facilitate period-to-period comparisons. NeoPhotonics believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of its operations that, when viewed with its GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting its business.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call today, Thursday, March 1, 2018 at 4:30 P.M.
