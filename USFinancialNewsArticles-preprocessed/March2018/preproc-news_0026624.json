    "text": "WOODSIDE, Calif., March 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GSV Capital Corp. (“GSV Capital” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:GSVC) today announced financial results for the quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Net assets totaled approximately $204.8 million, or $9.64 per share, at December 31, 2017, as compared to $9.69 per share at September 30, 2017 and $8.66 per share at December 31, 2016.\n\"In 2017, the GSV Capital team executed a range of proactive measures to enhance shareholder value,” said Michael Moe, Executive Chairman of GSV Capital. “Key initiatives included reducing expenses, implementing a share repurchase program, initiating a tender offer for our convertible debt, and adjusting the Company’s advisory fee structure. We anticipate a positive impact to NAV resulting from GSV Asset Management’s forfeiture of $5 million of its previously accrued, but unearned incentive fee, which will be reflected in GSV Capital’s first quarter 2018 earnings.”\n“Entering 2018, we anticipate significant events in the coming weeks that will impact the valuation of GSV Capital’s portfolio, including imminent public listings from Spotify and Dropbox – our second and fourth largest positions, respectively,” Moe continued. “Looking ahead, we believe the fundamentals of the GSV Capital portfolio and the opportunity for investors are as strong as they have ever been.”\nInvestment Portfolio as of December 31, 2017\nAt December 31, 2017, GSV Capital held positions in 31 portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of approximately $220.6 million. As a result of the Company’s continued strategy to increase the size of its investments in individual portfolio companies, GSV Capital’s investment portfolio has consolidated around top positions. For example, the Company’s top five portfolio company investments accounted for 52.4% of the total portfolio at fair value as of December 31, 2017, compared to 39.0% as of December 31, 2016.\nTop Five Investments at December 31, 2017 $ in millions (rounded) Fair Value % of Total Portfolio Palantir Technologies, Inc. $ 35.1 15.9 % Spotify Technology S.A. 30.7 13.9 Coursera, Inc. 18.4 8.3 Dropbox, Inc. 17.9 8.1 StormWind, LLC 13.5 6.1 Total (rounded) $ 115.5 52.4 % Fourth Quarter 2017 Portfolio Investment Activity\nDuring 2017, GSV Capital did not fund any new investments.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2017, GSV Capital sold or wrote off securities in the following portfolio companies:\nShares Average Net Realized Sold/ Net Share Proceeds Gain/(Loss) (2) Portfolio Company Written Off Price (1) (in millions) (in millions) JAMF Holdings, Inc. 1,468,800 $23.78 $34.9 $25.5 Spotify Technology S.A. 3,657 $3,800 $13.9 $10.3 Dataminr, Inc. 1,206,346 $3.98 $4.8 $1.6 Whittle Schools, LLC 3,000,229 $1.52 $4.6 $(0.2) Chegg, Inc. 282,192 $15.97 $4.5 $1.2 Strategic Data Command, LLC 2,400,000 $1.02 $2.5 $1.5 Palantir Technologies, Inc. 326,797 $6.40 $2.1 $1.1 Handle Financial, Inc. 548,034 $0.00 - $(14.0) Circle Media (2) 2,745,070 $0.00 - $(1.8)\n(1) The average net share price is the net share price realized after deducting all commissions and fees on the sale(s), if applicable.\n(2) Write-off includes a promissory note with principal value of $25,008.\nSubsequent to quarter-end, through March 13, 2018, GSV Capital sold positions in the following portfolio companies:\nAverage Net Realized Shares Net Share Proceeds Gain/(Loss) Portfolio Company Sold Price (1) (in millions) (in millions) Chegg, Inc. 500,000 $18.89 $9.4 $3.4 NestGSV, Inc.
