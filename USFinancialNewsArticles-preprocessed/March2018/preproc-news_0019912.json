    "text": "MISSISSAUGA, Ontario, March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KP Tissue Inc. (KPT) (TSX:KPT) reports the Q4 and full year 2017 financial and operational results of KPT and Kruger Products L.P. (KPLP). Kruger Products is Canada's leading manufacturer of quality tissue products for the Consumer market (Cashmere, Purex, SpongeTowels, Scotties, and White Swan) and the Away-From-Home market, and continues to grow in the U.S. Consumer tissue business with the White Cloud® brand and premium private label products. KPT currently holds a 15.9% interest in KPLP.\nKPLP Full Year 2017 Business and Financial Highlights\nRevenue increased by 4.2% to $1,280.0 million in 2017 compared to $1,227.9 million in 2016 Adjusted EBITDA was $144.2 million in 2017, down from $152.5 million in 2016, a 5.4% decrease TAD products Adjusted EBITDA contribution continued to be strong, reaching previously set target\nKPLP Q4 2017 Business and Financial Highlights\nRevenue increased slightly to $340.0 million in Q4 2017 compared to Q4 2016 Adjusted EBITDA was $33.7 million in Q4 2017 compared to $42.9 million in Q4 2016 Experienced record high pulp and freight costs in the quarter Successful ramp-up of new Paper Machine #8 and a new converting line in Crabtree, Quebec Declared a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share to be paid on April 16, 2018\n“We are proud of the record revenue achieved in 2017 of nearly $1.3 billion. Our cost-saving initiatives, capital investment program and the selling price increase that took effect in Q4 in the Canadian Consumer market alleviated only part of the impact from the significant run-up in market pulp prices and the unprecedented increase in freight costs, impacting our results in the fourth quarter,” said Mario Gosselin, CEO of KP Tissue and KPLP.\n“We continue to be #1 in the Canadian tissue market, and achieved our target for the TAD products Adjusted EBITDA contribution in the U.S. Furthermore, we ramped up production of our Crabtree (Quebec) paper machine, and improved our results for the Away-from-Home segment despite the impact of higher input costs.\n“We are committed to our long-term strategy of building our brands in Canada and growing our business in the United States. For the first quarter of 2018, even with the full impact of the Canadian Consumer price increase, we expect Adjusted EBITDA to decrease over Q1 2017, due primarily to the continued escalation of pulp and freight costs. We are implementing a value creation program to partially mitigate the impact of these extraordinary short-term market conditions,” concluded Mr. Gosselin.\nKPLP Q4 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue in Q4 2017 was $340.0 million, compared to $339.6 million in Q4 2016, an increase of $0.4 million or 0.1%. The increase in revenue was primarily due to a selling price increase in Canada, offset by lower Consumer sales volume in Canada and the unfavourable impact of foreign exchange on U.S. dollar sales.\nCost of sales in Q4 2017 increased to $296.0 million from $284.2 million in Q4 2016, primarily due to significantly higher pulp costs, as well as higher freight costs, partially offset by the favourable impact of foreign exchange on U.S. dollar denominated costs. As a percentage of revenue, cost of sales were 87.1% in Q4 2017 compared to 83.7% in Q4 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in Q4 2017 were $23.7 million, compared to $26.4 million in Q4 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower bonus compensation and cost reduction initiatives. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A expenses were 7.0% in Q4 2017, compared to 7.8% in Q4 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA in Q4 2017 was $33.7 million, compared to $42.9 million in Q4 2016, lower by $9.2 million or 21.4%, primarily due to higher pulp costs and increased freight costs, partially offset by lower SG&A expenses.\nNet loss in Q4 2017 was $18.0 million, compared to $4.5 million in Q4 2016, primarily due to lower Adjusted EBITDA of $9.2 million, an increase in tax expense of $5.8 million, a decrease in the gain on sale of non-financial assets of $2.5 million and a change in fair value of derivatives of $0.4 million in Q4 2017. These items were partially offset by a decrease in the change in amortized cost of Partnership units liability of $3.3 million and lower depreciation expense of $0.5 million.\nTotal liquidity, representing cash and cash equivalents and availability under the credit line within covenant limitations, was $53.3 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $76.0 million as of September 24, 2017.\nKPLP 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue was $1,280.0 million in Fiscal 2017, compared to $1,227.9 million in Fiscal 2016, an increase of $52.1 million or 4.2%. The increase in revenue was primarily due to increased sales volume across all regions.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $144.2 million in Fiscal 2017, compared to $152.5 million in Fiscal 2016. The decrease was primarily due to higher fibre costs, and increased freight and warehousing costs. These were partially offset by increased sales volume and lower SG&A expenses.\nNet income was $15.3 million in Fiscal 2017, compared to $35.5 million in Fiscal 2016. The decrease in net income was primarily due to an increase in tax expense of $9.2 million, lower Adjusted EBITDA of $8.3 million, higher depreciation expense of $3.9 million, a decrease in the gain on sale of non-financial assets of $2.8 million and the change in fair value of derivatives of $0.4 million. These decreases were partially offset by a decrease in interest expense of $2.0 million, a change in the foreign exchange gain of $1.1 million, a decrease in restructuring costs of $0.8 million and a decrease in the change in amortized cost of Partnership units liability of $0.4 million\nKPT Q4 2017 Financial Results\nKPT incurred a net loss of $4.2 million in Q4 2017. Included in the net loss was $2.9 million representing KPT’s share of KPLP’s loss. The loss was increased by depreciation expense of $1.5 million related to adjustments to carrying amounts on acquisition.\nKPT 2017 Financial Results\nKPT incurred a net loss of $5.4 million in 2017. Included in the net loss was $2.5 million representing KPT’s share of KPLP’s income. The income was reduced by depreciation expense of $5.9 million related to adjustments to carrying amounts on acquisition and income tax expense of $2.2 million\nDividends on Common Shares\nThe Board of Directors of KPT declared a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share to be paid on April 16, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 2, 2018.\nAdditional Information\nFor additional information please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) of KPT and KPLP for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com or our website at www.kptissueinc.com .\nFourth Quarter Results Conference Call Information\nKPT will hold its fourth quarter conference call on Thursday, March 8, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.\nVia telephone: 1-877-223-4471 or 647-788-4922\nVia the internet at: www.kptissueinc.com\nPresentation material referenced during the conference call will be available at www.kptissueinc.com .\nA rebroadcast of the conference call will be available until midnight, March 15, 2018 by dialing 800-585-8367 or 416-621-4642 and entering passcode 4083249.\nThe replay of the webcast will remain available on the website until midnight, March 15, 2018.\nAbout KP Tissue Inc.

For more information visit www.krugerproducts.ca .\nNon-IFRS Measures\nThis press release uses certain non-IFRS financial measures which KPLP believes provide useful information to management of KPLP and the readers of the financial information in measuring the financial performance and financial condition of KPLP. These measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. An example of such a measure is Adjusted EBITDA. Beginning with Q4 2015 in accordance with Canadian Securities Administrators Staff Notice 52-306 (Revised), we reference Adjusted EBITDA as a non-IFRS financial measure. This term replaces the previously referenced non-IFRS financial measure EBITDA. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA is unchanged from our former definition of EBITDA. Accordingly, this change in terminology has no impact on our reported financial results for prior periods. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of operating performance computed in accordance with IFRS and should not be considered as a substitute for operating income, net income or cash flows from operating activities computed in accordance with IFRS. “Adjusted EBITDA” is calculated by KPLP as net income (loss) before (i) interest expense, (ii) income taxes, (iii) depreciation, (iv) amortization, (v) impairment (gain on sale) of non-financial assets, (vi) loss (gain) on disposal of property, plant and equipment, (vii) foreign exchange loss (gain), (viii) costs related to restructuring activities, (ix) changes in amortized cost of Partnership units liability, and (x) one-time costs due to pension revaluations related to past service. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the relevant reported results can be found in the MD&A of KPT and KPLP for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this press release about KPT's and KPLP's current and future plans, expectations and intentions, results, levels of activity, performance, goals or achievements or any other future events or developments constitute forward-looking statements. The words \"may\", \"will\", \"would\", \"should\", \"could\", \"expects\", \"plans\", \"intends\", \"trends\", \"indications\", \"anticipates\", \"believes\", \"estimates\", \"predicts\", \"likely\" or \"potential\" or the negative or other variations of these words or other comparable words or phrases, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking information is based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by KPT, including expectations and assumptions concerning: the impact of the TAD Project on Adjusted EBITDA; the expectation of continued growth in sales of TAD products in the U.S.; a successful ramp-up of the Crabtree paper machine; improved performance of the Away-From-Home business; and expanded distribution of White Cloud to select U.S. retailers. Although KPT believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking information is based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking information since no assurance can be given that such expectations and assumptions will prove to be correct.\nThe outlook provided in respect of Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 2018 is forward-looking information and is subject to the risk and uncertainties referred to below. The purpose of the outlook is to provide the reader with an indication of management’s expectations, at the date of this press release, regarding KPLP’s future financial performance. Readers are cautioned that this information may not be appropriate for other purposes.\nMany factors could cause KPLP’s actual results, level of activity, performance or achievements or future events or developments (which could in turn affect the economic benefits derived from the Corporation’s economic interest in KPLP) to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, the following factors, which are discussed in greater detail in the “Risk Factors – Risks Related to KPLP’s Business” section of the KPT Annual Information Form dated March 9, 2018 available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com : Kruger Inc.’s influence over KPLP; KPLP’s reliance on Kruger Inc.; consequences of an event of insolvency relating to Kruger Inc.; risks associated with the TAD Project; operational risks; Gatineau Plant land lease; significant increases in input costs; reduction in supply of fibre; increased pricing pressure and intense competition; KPLP’s inability to innovate effectively; adverse economic conditions; dependence on key retail trade customers; damage to the reputation of KPLP or KPLP’s brands; KPLP’s sales being less than anticipated; KPLP’s failure to implement its business and operating strategies; KPLP’s obligation to make regular capital expenditures; KPLP’s entering into unsuccessful acquisitions; KPLP’s dependence on key personnel; KPLP’s inability to retain its existing customers or obtain new customers; KPLP’s loss of key suppliers; KPLP’s failure to adequately protect its intellectual property rights; KPLP’s reliance on third party intellectual property licenses; adverse litigation and other claims affecting KPLP; material expenditures due to comprehensive environmental regulation affecting KPLP’s cash flow; KPLP’s pension obligations are significant and can be materially higher than predicted if KPLP Management’s underlying assumptions are incorrect; labour disputes adversely affecting KPLP’s cost structure and KPLP’s ability to run its plants; exchange rate and U.S. competitors; KPLP’s inability to service all of its indebtedness; exposure to potential consumer product liability, covenant compliance; interest rate and refinancing risk; information technology; cyber-security; insurance; internal controls; and trade related risk.\nReaders should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements made herein. The forward-looking information contained herein is expressly qualified in its entirety by this cautionary statement. The forward-looking information contained herein is made as of the date of press release and KPT undertakes no obligation to publicly update such forward-looking information to reflect new information, subsequent or otherwise, unless required by applicable securities laws.\nINFORMATION:\nFrancois Paroyan\nGeneral Counsel and Corporate Secretary\nKP Tissue Inc.\nTel.: 905.812.6936\nfrancois.paroyan@krugerproducts.ca\nINVESTORS:\nMike Baldesarra\nDirector of Investor Relations\nKP Tissue Inc.\nTel.: 905.812.6962\nIR@KPTissueinc.com\nKruger Products L.P.
