    "text": "HOBOKEN, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (NYSE: JW-A and JW-B), a global research and learning company, today announced results for the third quarter ending January 31, 2018.\nThird quarter revenue up 4% to $455.7 million, or down 1% at constant currency Third quarter GAAP EPS up 45% to $1.19 primarily due to impact of the US Tax Act; Adjusted EPS down 14% at constant currency Year-to-date revenue up 4% to $1,318.9 million, or up 1% at constant currency Year-to-date GAAP EPS $2.39 compared to $1.15 in prior year; Adjusted EPS at constant currency up 1% Cash Provided by Operations for the nine months of $190.1 million, down from $229.2 million due to the timing of calendar year 2018 journal renewals; Free Cash Flow less Product Development Spending of $80.7 million, down from $119.5 million Full year 2018 outlook reaffirmed\nMANAGEMENT COMMENTARY\n“We continue to see good momentum in the business, with steady year-to-date growth in Research, improved profitability in Solutions, and better-than-expected results in Publishing,” said Brian Napack, Wiley’s President and CEO. “We are realizing operating margin and earnings growth while also making great progress in how we operate, invest, and innovate, positioning us to drive more value from our existing businesses and exploit new market opportunities.”\nFINANCIAL SUMMARY\nWiley provides non-GAAP financial measures such as “Adjusted EPS,” “Adjusted Operating Income,” “Adjusted CTP,” “Free Cash Flow less Product Development Spending,” and results on a Constant Currency basis to assess underlying business performance and trends. Management believes non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the impact of restructuring charges and credits and certain other items, provide for a more comparable basis to analyze operating results and earnings. See the reconciliations of non-GAAP financials and explanations of the uses of non-GAAP measures in the supplementary information accompanying this press release.\nGAAP Measures\nUnaudited ($millions except for EPS)\nQ3 2018 Q3 2017 Change Change\nConstant Currency\nRevenue $455.7 $436.5 4% (1%) Operating Income $67.4 $51.2 32% Diluted EPS $1.19 $0.82 45% Non-GAAP Measures Q3 2018 Q3 2017 Change\nConstant Currency\nAdjusted Operating Income $69.6 $60.3 2% Adjusted EPS $0.87 $0.89 (14%) Revenue performance was mixed with growth in Research (+9% reported, or +1% at constant currency) and Solutions (+5%, or +2% constant currency) offset by a decline in Publishing (-1%, or -3% at constant currency). GAAP Operating Income growth resulted from favorable foreign exchange, favorable timing of restructuring charges, and savings from operational excellence initiatives and restructuring. Adjusted Operating Income growth was mainly due to savings in technology and prior restructuring activities. US Tax Act: As a result of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“the Tax Act”) enacted on December 22, 2017, the Company recorded an estimated non-cash tax benefit of $25 million, or $0.43 per share. Going forward, since most of the Company’s pre-tax income is earned outside the U.S., Wiley anticipates a small, favorable impact to its effective tax rate and cash taxes. GAAP EPS growth reflected the estimated non-cash tax credit of $0.43 per share due to the Tax Act and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. Adjusted EPS decline was primarily due to favorable tax credits of $0.12 per share in the prior year period.\nRESEARCH SEGMENT\nMetric ($M) Q3 2018 Q3 2017 Change Change\nConstant Currency\nRevenue $223.5 $205.8 9% 1% GAAP CTP $59.3 $52.5 13% Adjusted CTP $60.0 $53.0 (2%) CTP – Contribution to Profit.\nRevenue increase reflected growth in Journals (+9% reported, +1% constant currency) and Atypon (+4%). GAAP CTP increase was primarily a result of favorable foreign exchange. Adjusted CTP decline reflected higher royalty costs in licensed society publishing.\nPUBLISHING SEGMENT\nMetric ($M) Q3 2018 Q3 2017 Change Change\nConstant Currency\nRevenue $170.2 $171.4 (1%) (3%) GAAP CTP $48.5 $38.8 25% Adjusted CTP $48.1 $39.8 16% Revenue growth in STM and Professional Publishing (+5% reported, +2% constant currency) was offset by declines in Educational Publishing (-4% reported, -6% constant currency). Course Workflow/WileyPLUS was down due to previously disclosed timing of revenue recognition, which reflects longer sales amortization for subscription periods extending across two semesters. GAAP CTP growth reflected favorable foreign exchange and the impact of restructuring credits and charges. Adjusted CTP growth was due to savings from operational excellence initiatives and prior restructuring activities.\nSOLUTIONS SEGMENT\nMetric ($M) Q3 2018 Q3 2017 Change Change\nConstant Currency\nRevenue $61.9 $59.2 5% 2% GAAP CTP $6.4 $3.6 78% Adjusted CTP $7.7 $4.7 67% Revenue increased 5% reported, or 2% at constant currency. Education Services (OPM) rose 7% (reported and at constant currency); Corporate Learning rose 7% reported, but declined 4% at constant currency; and Professional Assessment declined 4% reported, or declined 5% at constant currency. GAAP CTP growth reflected the timing of restructuring charges. Adjusted CTP growth was driven by increased operating efficiency and prior cost savings initiatives in our Education Services/OPM business.\nNINE MONTH RESULTS\nGAAP Measures\nUnaudited ($millions except for EPS)\nYTD 2018 YTD 2017 Change Change\nConstant Currency\nRevenue $1,318.9 $1,266.3 4% 1% Operating Income $164.7 $142.7 15% Diluted EPS $2.39 $1.15 Cash Provided by Operations $190.1 $229.2 (17%) Non-GAAP Measures YTD 2018 YTD 2017 Change\nConstant Currency\nAdjusted Operating Income $194.8 $166.6 3% Adjusted EPS $2.49 $2.20 1% Free Cash Flow less Product Development Spending $80.7 $119.5 (32%) Revenue growth for the nine months was driven primarily by Research (+9% reported, +4% constant currency), including $14 million due to the full-year contribution from Atypon (acquired October 2016), and Solutions (+5% reported, +4% constant currency), which offset a decline in Publishing (-3% reported, -4% constant currency). GAAP Operating Income growth was due to higher revenue, favorable foreign exchange, and a pension settlement in the prior year, which offset higher restructuring and related charges in the current year. Adjusted Operating Income growth was mainly due to higher revenue and savings from operational excellence initiatives and restructuring, notably in Technology, Operations, and in the Publishing and Solutions segments. GAAP EPS growth for the nine months reflected the current year impact of the Tax Act and favorable foreign exchange, as well as other charges in the prior year, including an unfavorable ruling in a Germany income tax dispute and a large pension settlement. This offset higher restructuring charges and foreign exchange losses associated with intercompany transactions in the current fiscal year. Adjusted EPS growth in the nine months was due to higher operating income, lower interest expense, and a higher effective tax rate resulting from larger tax credits in the prior year. Cash Provided by Operations and Free Cash Flow less Product Development Spending were both down $39 million, due to the timing of journal billings and cash collections. Capital expenditures, including Technology, Property, and Equipment (TP&E) and Product development spending, were essentially flat with prior year. Shareholder Return: Through nine months, Wiley utilized $55.1 million of cash for dividends and $29.3 million for share repurchases, compared to $53.6 million and $35.4 million in the prior year.\nFISCAL YEAR 2018 OUTLOOK\nThe Company reaffirms its fiscal 2018 guidance:\nMetric ($M, except EPS) FY17 Actual FY18 Expectation\nConstant Currency\nRevenue $1,718.5 Approximately even Adjusted Operating Income $228.4 Approximately even Adjusted EPS $3.01 Low-single digit % decline Cash Provided by Operations $314.5 $350 million or higher Capital Expenditures $148.3 Slightly lower If current rates were to hold through year-end, Wiley would record favorable foreign currency variances in the fiscal year of approximately $49 million in revenue, $27 million in operating income, and $0.34 in EPS due to changes in exchange rates and functional currency gains related to calendar year 2017 journal subscriptions in the UK.\nEARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL\nScheduled for today, March 6 at 10:00 a.m. (ET).

For\nthe three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, there were charges of $2.2 million or $0.04 per share and charges of $9.1 million or $0.10 per share,\nrespectively. For the nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, there were charges of $30.1 million or $0.37 per share, and charges of $15.0 million or $0.17\nper share, respectively.\n(B) In 2017, we adjusted results to exclude foreign exchange gains and losses associated with intercompany transactions. The prior year adjusted earnings per share\namounts have been recasted to conform to current year presentation. For the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, there were gains of $5.3 million or\n$0.07 per share and losses of $2.7 million or $(0.03) per share, respectively. For the nine months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, there were gains of $11.6 million\nor $0.16 per share, and gains of $0.6 million or $0.01 per share, respectively.\n(C) In connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017, for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018, the Company recorded an\nestimated income tax benefit of $25.0 million, or $(0.43) per share. Given the significant complexity of the Act, anticipated guidance from the U.S. Treasury, and\npotential additional guidance from the SEC or the Financial Accounting Standards Board, these estimates may be adjusted within 12 months of the enactment\ndate.\n(D) As previously disclosed and as reported in the Company's SEC filings, the Company announced a voluntary, limited-time opportunity for terminated vested\nemployees who were participants in the U.S. defined benefit retirement plan to elect a single lump sum payment of accumulated benefits. The election period\nclosed on August 29, 2016. The total charge including a prorata portion of the unamortized net actuarial loss was included in operating and administrative\nexpenses and was $8.8 million or $0.09 per share. The aggregate amount of payments under this one time election was $28.3 million, which was paid from pension\nplan assets in October 2016.\n(E) As previously disclosed in the Company's SEC filings, the Company was appealing an unfavorable tax ruling in Germany related to tax benefits obtained through an\nincrease in the tax deductible basis of certain merged German subsidiaries. In September 2016, the German Federal Fiscal Court issued an unfavorable final\njudgement in Wiley's longstanding tax appeal. As a result in 2016, the Company recorded a $47.5 million charge, or $0.82 per share in the second quarter of fiscal\nyear 2017.\n(F) As previously disclosed in the Company's SEC filings, the adjusted results for the nine months ended January 31, 2017 exclude deferred tax benefits of $2.6 million,\nor $0.04 per share, associated with tax legislation enacted in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 in the United Kingdom that reduced the U.K. corporate income\ntax rates by 1 percentage point in 2020. The benefits reflect the remeasurement of the Company's deferred tax balances from 18% to the new income tax rate of\n17% effective April 1, 2020 and had no current cash tax impact.\n(1) See Explanation of Usage of Non-GAAP performance measures included in this supplementary information for additional details on the reasons why management\nbelieves presentation of each non-GAAP performance measure provides useful information to investors.

Non-GAAP performance measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by US GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures used by other companies, and should not be viewed as alternatives to measures of financial results under US GAAP.\nThe Company presents these non-GAAP performance measures in addition to GAAP financial results because it believes that these non-GAAP performance measures provide useful information to certain investors and financial analysts for operational trends and comparisons across accounting periods. The use of these non-GAAP performance measures provides a consistent basis to evaluate operating profitability and performance trends by excluding items that we do not consider to be controllable activities for this purpose. For example:\nAdjusted EPS, Adjusted Operating Profit, Adjusted CTP provide a more comparable basis to analyze operating results and earnings and are measures commonly used by shareholders to measure our performance. Free Cash Flow less product development spending helps assess our ability, over the long term, to create value for our shareholders as it represents cash available to repay debt, pay common dividends and fund share repurchases and new acquisitions. Results on a constant currency basis removes distortion from the effects of foreign currency movements to provide better comparability of our business trends from period to period. We measure our performance before the impact of foreign currency (or at “constant currency”), which means that we apply the same foreign currency exchange rates for the current and equivalent prior period.\nIn addition, the Company has historically provided these or similar non-GAAP performance measures and understands that some investors and financial analysts find this information helpful in analyzing the Company's operating margins, and net income and comparing the Company's financial performance to that of its peer companies and competitors. Based on interactions with investors, we also believe that our non-GAAP performance measures are regarded as useful to our investors as supplemental to our GAAP financial results, and that there is no confusion regarding the adjustments or our operating performance to our investors due to the comprehensive nature of our disclosures.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180306005920/en/\nJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.\nInvestor Relations\nBrian Campbell, 201-748-6874\nbrian.campbell@wiley.com\nSource: John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",
