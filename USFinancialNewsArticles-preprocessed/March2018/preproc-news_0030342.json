These one-time expenses primarily relate to legal and professional services with respect to our acquisition and financing activities and costs associated with severance, recruitment and relocation of employees, as well as purchase accounting adjustments. See the reconciliation table for more information as well as a reconciliation of this Non-GAAP measure to Net Income (Loss) per Share. 2 Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) per Share, is calculated by combining the Company’s GAAP Net Income (Loss) or earnings per share, with the one-time expense described in Note 1 above, and the following additional items: amortization expense on acquisition-related intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense.

Released a new version of Asure’s Time & Labor mobile app with geo positioning verification, continuing Asure’s lead in this technology area. Expanded Digital Workplace initiatives, including enhanced map and navigational views to support team collaboration, IoT driven indoor positioning, and expansion of Asure’s already deep integration with Microsoft’s O365 platform. Multiple senior and executive management hires, including the addition of CFO Kelyn Brannon, former CFO of Arista Networks, Calix, and Calypso Technology. In addition, Web Hill, former Executive VP at Ceridian and Wells Fargo, was brought in as Vice President and General Manager for the Evolution HCM business; while Bob Diez, formerly of IBM and Ceridian, was brought in as Vice President and General Manager for the Asure HR Consulting business. Successful completion of capital raises through the sale of common equity and increased credit facility resulting in a new financial partnership with Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs.\nFiscal 2018 Financial Guidance\nAsure management is raising its financial guidance for fiscal 2018 ending December 31, 2018:\n2018 Financial Guidance Fiscal 2018 Revenue $79.0 million to $82.0 million Non-GAAP EBITDA, excluding one-time items $18.0 million to $20.0 million For fiscal 2018, Asure expects to achieve between $79.0 million and $82.0 million in revenue, with Non-GAAP EBITDA, excluding one-time items, of between $18.0 million and $20.0 million.\nAsure reaffirmed its previously communicated objective to reach double-digit organic revenue growth along with multiple “tuck-in” acquisitions of resellers of its channel products.\nManagement Commentary\n“2017 was a year of significant progress for Asure,” said company CEO Pat Goepel. “From a financial standpoint, we achieved several records, including for revenue, gross profit, cloud revenue and non-GAAP EBITDA. Our success was driven by continued strong execution and growth across the entire business, but particularly in cloud revenue, as we added new customers onto our platform as well as transitioned existing customers to the cloud. In fact, revenue from our cloud services more than doubled in the fourth quarter and was up more than 90% for the year, a direct result of the emphasis we’re placing on this important and growing area of our business. In addition, our cloud bookings were up 228% in the fourth quarter and 162% for the full year, reflecting the effectiveness of the strategy we implemented during 2017 that emphasizes that our entire sales team sells our full suite of products, from time & labor and workspace management to human capital management.”\nAsure CFO Kelyn Brannon added: “Our continued execution of our cloud strategy produced strong gross margins and recurring revenue both in Q4 and the full year, along with solid EBITDA and non-GAAP profitability as well. The 53% improvement in our non-GAAP EBITDA for 2017 would have been even stronger, and in line with our guidance, but our results were hampered by higher commission expenses, which were actually due to our strong cloud bookings, investments we made to solidify our infrastructure for larger acquisitions in 2018, as well as one larger customer who decided to purchase our solutions in a phased quarterly plan rather than entirely in one quarter. Altogether, these factors totaled approximately $1.2 million in the fourth quarter. Additionally, while our EPS numbers were in line with our guidance, we did receive a $0.04 tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 from the 2017 tax reform legislation. As we look ahead, our strong cash position as well as these investments in infrastructure have contributed to an improvement in the operating leverage of our business model.”\nGoepel continued: “Additionally, beyond our solid organic growth numbers, we’ve also continued to showcase our prowess in finding highly accretive and synergistic acquisition opportunities. In January we finalized deals on three different service bureaus in our payroll processing business, all of which are already fully integrated and providing Asure with opportunities for significant customer, product and financial synergies, which is directly in line with our overall growth strategy. These bureaus also expand Asure's footprint across the U.S., giving us greater coverage nationwide. Our acquisition of TelePayroll, in particular, gives us a much stronger foothold in the West Coast. Meanwhile Savers Administrative represented our entry into the Carolinas, and Pay Systems of America further bolstered our position in the Southeast.\n“Between our financial and operational successes in 2017 and our continuing accretive acquisitions, Asure entered the new year with solid momentum. We remain focused on the key initiatives that have and will continue to drive us forward: accelerating the velocity of our cross-selling opportunities and scaling our business further. Our execution on this roadmap will lead us to continued success in 2018. In fact, by year end, we plan to have generated $79.0 million to $82.0 million in revenue and $18.0 million to $20.0 million in non-GAAP EBITDA. Our company has the right growth strategy, significant financial and operational momentum, and industry-leading solutions that will power us to scale our business even further, both in the near-term and over the longer run as well.”\nConference Call Details\nAsure management will host a conference call today (Thursday, March 15, 2018) at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time (10:00 a.m. Central time) to discuss these financial results and outlook.

These supplemental financial measures are not required by GAAP, nor is the presentation of this financial information intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Management recognizes that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the expenses associated with Asure’s earnings results as determined in accordance with GAAP. However, for the reasons described below, management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of Asure’s business. Asure’s management believes that it is important to provide investors with these same tools, together with reconciliation to GAAP, for evaluating the performance of Asure’s business, as it may provide additional insight into Asure’s financial results. See the “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income (Loss) to Net Income (Loss) Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization and Stock Compensation Expense (EBITDA)” and the “Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income/(Loss) to Net Income (Loss) Excluding One-Time Expenses” tables included in this press release for further information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, these measures are presented because management believes they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and others in the evaluation of companies.\nEBITDA is calculated by adding income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization and stock compensation expense to net earnings. EBITDA is not defined under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings and other consolidated earnings data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of Asure’s profitability.\nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss) Excluding One-Time Expenses is calculated by combining the company’s GAAP Net Income (Loss), or earnings per share, with expenses that management believes are one time in nature and are not expected to recur on a dollar or per share basis. These one-time expenses primarily relate to legal and professional services with respect to our acquisition and financing activities and costs associated with severance, recruitment and relocation of employees, as well as purchase accounting adjustments.\nNon-GAAP Net Income (Loss) is calculated by combining the company’s GAAP Net Income (Loss), or earnings per share, with the one-time expenses that are excluded in the company’s Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) Excluding One-Time Expenses, and also excluding the impact of the following: amortization expense on acquisition-related intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense. We have revised our non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) to include acquisition-related amortization, as we believe this will more accurately reflect how we analyze our operations and provide information needed by investors to gain additional insight into our financial results. These expenses have been included in the non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) for all periods presented.\nGuidance\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA Excluding One-time Expenses:\n$000s Fiscal 2018 Net Income (Loss) $ (1,500 ) to $ (2,000 ) Interest 7,500 to 8,000 Tax 500 to 1,000 Depreciation and Amortization 2,400 to 2,800 Amortization of Acquisition Related Intangibles 6,400 to 6,800 Stock Compensation 700 to 900 EBITDA 16,000 to 17,500 One-time expenses 2,000 to 2,500 EBITDA excluding one-time expenses $ 18,000 to $ 20,000\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income (Loss) to Net Income (Loss) Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation,\nAmortization and Stock Compensation Expense (EBITDA) and Non-GAAP EBITDA Excluding One-time Expenses.\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED $000s December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 Net Income (Loss) (1,545 ) 131 Interest 1,403 543 Tax (272 ) 56 Depreciation 337 193 Amortization 1,379 730 Stock Compensation 230 60 EBITDA 1,532 1,713 One-time expenses 2,074 502 Non-GAAP EBITDA excluding one-time expenses 3,606 2,215\nFOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED $000s December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 Net Loss (5,722 ) (972 ) Interest 4,764 1,917 Tax 96 189 Depreciation 1,128 935 Amortization 4,930 2,678 Stock Compensation 593 226 EBITDA 5,789 4,973 One-time expenses 5,739 2,550 Non-GAAP EBITDA excluding one-time expenses 11,528 7,523\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income (Loss) to Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) Excluding One-time Expenses\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED $000s December 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016 Net Income (Loss) (1,545 ) 131 Legal & Professional Services 951 429 Severance, Recruitment & Relocation 474 - Other one-time items (net) 649 73 Sub-total excluding Taxes 2,074 502 Sub-total one-time expenses 2,074 502 Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) excluding one-time expenses 529 633 Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding 12,583 7,098 Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) per Share, excluding one-time expenses $ 0.04 $ 0.09\nFOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED $000s December 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016 Net Income (Loss) (5,722 ) (972 ) Legal & Professional Services 3,435 1,411 Severance, Recruitment & Relocation 1,333 809 Other one-time expenses (net) 971 330 Sub-total excluding Taxes 5,739 2,550 Sub-total one-time expenses 5,739 2,550 Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) excluding one-time expenses 17 1,578 Weighted average shares of common stock outstanding 11,092 6,619 Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) per Share, excluding one-time expenses $ 0.00 $ 0.24\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income (Loss) to Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss)\nFOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED $000s December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016\nNet Income (Loss) (1,545 ) 131 Amortization expense on acquisition-related intangible assets 1,379 730 One-time expenses 2,074 502 Stock compensation 230 60 Sub-total Non-GAAP Expenses 3,683 1,292 Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) 2,138 1,423 Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 12,683 7,098 Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) per Share $ 0.17 $ 0.20\nFOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED $000s December 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nNet Income (Loss) (5,722 ) (972 ) Amortization expense on acquisition-related intangible assets 4,930 2,678 One-time expenses 5,739 2,550 Stock compensation 593 226 Sub-total Non-GAAP Expenses 11,262 5,454 Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) 5,540 4,482 Weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding 11,092 6,619 Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss) per Share $ 0.50 $ 0.68\nSource:Asure Software Inc",
