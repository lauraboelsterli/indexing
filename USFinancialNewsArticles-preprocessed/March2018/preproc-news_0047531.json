REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/Files In February, the Supreme Court quashed all iron ore mining permits and mining was ordered stopped from March 16 in Goa, one of the country’s top producing states for the material used in steel.\nBillionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Resources, the state’s biggest ore miner, said there could be a likely impairment of $500-600 million net of taxes, or $700-$800 million gross of taxes, on this account.\nCourt action against illegal mining shut the Goa industry for more than two years from 2012, prior to which Goa had exported about 50 million tonnes a year. The Supreme Court later limited production in the state to 20 million tonnes a year.\nThe latest ban would affect not only Vedanta but also several small unlisted companies run by local families.\nVedanta Ltd is expected to produce around 5.5 million tonnes of Goa ore in the fiscal year ending March 31. India’s ore production was 192 million tonnes last fiscal year.\nThe parent company said its Goa ore business would not have “any material impact” on the profitability of the group.\nShares of Vedanta Resources were up 1.7 percent at 1524 GMT.\nA man walks past the logo of Vedanta outside its headquarters in Mumbai, India January 31, 2018.
