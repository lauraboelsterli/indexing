Soccer Football - Premier League - Huddersfield Town vs Crystal Palace - John Smith's Stadium, Huddersfield, Britain - March 17, 2018 Crystal Palace's Wilfried Zaha REUTERS/Peter Powell \nZaha played for 89 minutes against Huddersfield Town this month in only his second game since returning from injury and Hodgson suggested the 25-year-old was feeling the effects of coming back too early. \n“Zaha hasn’t been training to any great extent as we’re nursing his knee problem that he has. We will have a look at him tomorrow and hope the knee will be OK,” Hodgson told a news conference. \n“We’ve had to be cautious after the Huddersfield game as he came back from injury much earlier than he should have done.” \nThe Ivory Coast international missed friendlies against Togo and Moldova last week. \nDefender Jeffrey Schlupp is also doubtful for the visit of Liverpool after he limped off early in the game against Huddersfield. \nCrystal Palace are 16th in the table with 30 points from 31 games while Liverpool are third.
