    "text": "March 15, 2018 / 2:39 AM / Updated 11 hours ago Two aviators killed in Super Hornet jet crash: U.S. Navy Reuters Staff 1 Min Read WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy said on Wednesday two aviators had been killed in a F/A-18F Super Hornet crash during a training flight off the coast of Key West, Florida. The Navy said in a statement the pilot and weapons systems officer were recovered from the water and declared dead after the two-seater jet crashed on its final approach to Naval Air Station Key West. The incident is under investigation, it said. U.S. President Donald Trump said in a statement posted on Twitter early Thursday: “Please join me with your thoughts and prayers for both aviators, their families and our incredible @USNavy.” A Navy spokesperson also said in a statement that the names of the aviators are being withheld pending notifications of their families. “Their families are in our prayers,” the statement said.
