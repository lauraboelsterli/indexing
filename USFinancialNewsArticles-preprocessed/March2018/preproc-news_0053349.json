Fortunately, the developers of a nearly $30 million Manhattan townhouse with its own two-car garage have you covered.\nFor those who can afford the luxury townhouse's huge price tag, developers Girona Ventures and Wonder Works are also throwing in something to fill that garage: a $500,000 Bentley. That's the sweet deal revealed on a recent episode of CNBC's \" Secret Lives of the Super Rich .\"\nGetty Images | Gerlach Delissen - Corbis The Bentley Continental GT on display at the 2017 Frankfurt Auto Show in 2017 Though, in order to get your hands on what real estate agent Alyssa Soto Brody calls a \"Bentley Batcave,\" you'll still need to be able to afford the $29.5 million cost of the entire 11,000-square-foot townhouse.\nIn addition to the fancy wheels, this five-bedroom, 11-bath home located in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood features high-end amenities such as a private sauna, steam room, yoga studio and a lap pool.\nRich Caplan | Compass Realty Brody notes that her favorite room in the house is the spacious 26-foot by 23-foot living room that features 13-foot ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows and a custom-made gas fireplace with LED lights that change colors.\nRich Caplan | Compass Realty The home's gourmet kitchen comes decked in marble and extremely unique cabinetry covered in Swarovski crystals and what Brody describes as \"vegan crocodile leather, [which is] just a super bougie way of saying 'faux crocodile.'\"\nRich Caplan | Compass Realty The kitchen also includes a $50,000 glass chandelier that Brody says was imported from Italy and hung \"piece by piece\" through two floors of the home. \"The most dramatic part is that it cascades into your kitchen,\" Brody says on the show.\nRich Caplan | Compass Realty The master bedroom covers the entire fourth floor of the townhouse, and it includes a bathroom with a \"luxurious bath clad in a hand-cut, custom Italian marble mosaic\" that Brody says took 600 man hours to install.\nRich Caplan | Compass Realty \"Secret Lives of the Super Rich\" host Robert Frank notes that the multimillion-dollar mansion could be the \"perfect high-end hideaway\" for prospective luxury homeowners with a taste for driving around the Big Apple. After all, some parking spaces in the city have sold for over $1 million in recent years.\nWatch new episodes of CNBC's \" Secret Lives of the Super Rich \" Wednesdays at 10P/ET. \nDon't miss: Look inside this $69 million home on the French Riviera, where the 1% of the 1% live \nLike this story?
