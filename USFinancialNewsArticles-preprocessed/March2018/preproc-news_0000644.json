Soccer Football - Championship - Leeds United vs Wolverhampton Wanderers - Elland Road, Leeds, Britain - March 7, 2018 Leeds United's Hadi Sacko in action with Wolverhampton Wanderers' Matt Doherty and Romain Saiss Action Images/Lee Smith Romain Saiss and Willy Boly scored with first-half headers and Benik Afobe lobbed the keeper after the break to wrap up victory for Wolves. Slideshow (4 Images) Nuno Espirito Santo’s side had gone three league games without a win and seen their advantage at the summit whittled down from 13 points to three after second-placed Cardiff City beat struggling Barnsley 2-1 on Tuesday. Victory at Elland Road, however, means that with 11 matches left to play, there is a 10-point gap between Wolves and third-placed Aston Villa, with the top two sides winning automatic promotion to the Premier League.
