    "text": "HALIFAX, Nova Scotia, MedMira Inc. (MedMira) (TSXV:MIR), reported today on its financial results for the quarter ended January 31, 2018.\nProfit and Loss Highlights\nRevenue: The Company recorded revenues in Q2 FY2018 of $183,876 compared to $193,576 in Q2 FY2017. The slight decrease in revenue was due to the Company’s strategy to focus on high profit margin markets. As outlined below, this strategy has resulted in the Company recording a higher contribution margin and has also indirectly decreased expenses. Gross Profit: The Company recorded a gross profit in Q2 FY2018 of $141,848 compared to $133,652 for the same period last year. The overall gross margin percentage on sales increased by 8% from 69% in Q2 FY2017 to 77% in this financial quarter. Operating expenses: In this quarter, the Company recorded operating expenses of $681,442 compared to $562,527 in Q2 FY2017. The increase of 21% in operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in the Company’s current research and development work on two new products. All other expenses decreased by 20% during this quarter compared to the same period last year. Net loss: The Company recorded a net loss of $713,854 compared to $549,604 in Q2 FY2017. The increase is mainly due to the rise in research and product development expenses for the Company’s new products.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nAssets: The Company had an expected decrease of its assets by $271,183 or 44% compared to last quarter due to receipt of trade receivables and tax receivables. Liabilities: The Company’s liabilities increased by $442,671 or 4% between Q1 FY2018 and Q2 FY2018. This was due to an increase in interest payables and accrued payables. Loans in default increased by $489,900 or 7% compared to last quarter. This increase was due to a related party’s loan being due. All long and short terms debts are currently under negotiation to restructure terms and conditions of repayment. Working Capital deficit: As a result of the increases noted above, the Company recorded higher working capital deficit of $691,696 or 7% compared to last quarter.\nThe Company’s financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis are available on the Company’s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . For matters of going concern, reference is made to the Auditor’s Emphasis of Matter statement in the fiscal year ended 2017 Auditors Report and note 2b in the audited financial statements which are also available on SEDAR.\nAbout MedMira\nMedMira is the developer and owner of Rapid Vertical Flow (RVF) Technology™.
