Simon Taylor , who previously served as the president of Comtrade Software and the chief strategy officer of Comtrade Group, will lead HYCU's worldwide initiatives from the company's Boston headquarters as HYCU's CEO.\n\"Our name change reflects the operational independence we enjoy as we begin to operate autonomously of Comtrade Group, expand our software offerings and grow our business worldwide,\" said Taylor. \"Today's news represents exciting new changes at HYCU, including the expansion of our Boston Corporate HQ. We're also on schedule to deliver several significant updates to our backup and recovery platform for Nutanix and I'm pleased to announce those today as well.

Simon's clear vision for where the industry is headed, and how best to leverage HYCU's strengths, is an essential part of the Company's growth strategy.\"\nWith continued acceptance from customers and with solutions that monitor and protect their mission-critical applications, HYCU is the first purpose-built application aware backup and recovery solutions for Nutanix customers and partners.
