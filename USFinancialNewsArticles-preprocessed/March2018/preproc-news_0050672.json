    "text": "March 29, 2018 / 9:51 PM / Updated 11 minutes ago Greece seeking higher price in gas grid sale - privatisation agency Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nATHENS (Reuters) - Greece’s privatisation agency said it is seeking a higher price from two suitors for a 66 percent stake in its gas grid operator DESFA after opening binding bids on Thursday. \nGreece relaunched the sale last year as part of its latest 86 billion euro international bailout, and after a previous 400 million euro (£350.7 million) deal with Azerbaijan’s SOCAR fell through in 2016. \nLast month Greece received two binding bids from Italy’s Snam, Spain’s Enagas Internacional and Belgium’s Fluxys, and from a consortium of Spain’s Regasificadora del Noroeste (Reganosa), Romania’s Transgaz and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). \nThe privatisation agency said in a statement that it asked the bidders to improve their financial offers. \n“Τhe prices offered exceeded 400 million euros,” Energy Minister George Stathakis said in a press release. He added the new round with improved bids will be completed in a few weeks. \nSnam declined to comment, while Reganosa did not immediately respond. \nAthens is selling a 31 percent stake and Hellenic Petroleum, Greece’s biggest oil refiner, its 35 percent stake in the grid. \nA share purchase agreement and a shareholders’ agreement for DESFA are due to be signed by April for the sale to conclude by June, before Greece exits its third bailout in August. \nDESFA, which owns and operates Greece’s natural gas network and a liquefied natural gas terminal on an islet off Athens, is considered a valuable asset as gas consumption in Greece rises and the country seeks to boost its presence in the regional energy market. \nDESFA transports gas from the Greek-Bulgarian and Greek-Turkish borders to Greek consumers via a 1,459-km (907-mile) pipeline.
