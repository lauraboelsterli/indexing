    "text": "March 25, 2018 / 2:41 PM / Updated an hour ago Belgium's Courtois to miss Saudi Arabia friendly through injury Reuters Staff 2 Min Read (Reuters) - Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has withdrawn from the Belgium squad for Tuesday’s friendly against Saudi Arabia due to a hamstring injury, the Belgian Football Association (RBFA) said on Sunday. Soccer Football - Champions League Round of 16 Second Leg - FC Barcelona vs Chelsea - Camp Nou, Barcelona, Spain - March 14, 2018 Chelsea's Thibaut Courtois looks dejected after the match Action Images via Reuters/Lee Smith The 25-year-old played in Chelsea’s 3-0 defeat by Barcelona in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie but missed the club’s FA Cup win over Leicester City last week, with manager Antonio Conte saying Courtois had a muscle injury. Courtois was called up by Belgium despite the problem but has failed to recover in time. “Thibaut Courtois has not recovered from his hamstring injury and left the group... Get well soon, Thibaut!” the RBFA said on their official Twitter account. The RBFA said that Belgium manager Roberto Martinez is yet to decide on Courtois’ replacement for the friendly with Liverpool’s Simon Mignolet likely to start. The Belgian’s injury makes him a major doubt for Chelsea’s crucial Premier League match against Tottenham Hotspur on April 1 as both teams battle to finish in the top four.
