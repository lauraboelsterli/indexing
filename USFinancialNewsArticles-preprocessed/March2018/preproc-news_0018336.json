    "text": "BOSTON, March 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Block & Leviton LLP ( www.blockesq.com ), a securities litigation firm representing investors nationwide, is investigating whether BioScrip, Inc. (\"BioScrip\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: BIOS) and certain of its officers and directors violated federal securities laws.\nOn March 8, 2018, BioScrip released its preliminary fourth quarter and full year financial results, but also disclosed that the Company had begun an internal accounting review because it \"identified internal control deficiencies in connection with account reconciliations for certain asset and liability accounts,\" and that this may cause a delay in the filing of its Form 10-K. The Company additionally announced that it \"has identified and will report a material weakness related to certain spreadsheets used to calculate periodic adjustments to\" certain accounts.\nOn this news, BioScrip stock has plunged nearly 20% in intraday trading, causing millions of dollars in losses to investors.\nIf you purchased or otherwise acquired BioScrip securities and have questions about your legal rights or possess information relevant to this investigation, you are encouraged to contact attorney Bradley Vettraino at (617) 398-5600, by email at bradley@blockesq.com , or by visiting www.blockesq.com/bioscrip .\nConfidentiality to whistleblowers or others with information relevant to this investigation is assured.\nBlock & Leviton LLP is a Boston-based law firm representing investors nationwide.
