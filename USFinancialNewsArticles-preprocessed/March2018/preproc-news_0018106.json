    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - France’s Orange ( ORAN.PA ) has signed a new deal to broadcast channels owned by Groupe TF1 ( TFFP.PA ), the companies said in a joint statement on Thursday, following a dispute the two were embroiled in over distribution fees.\nOrange had said earlier this week it was ready to stop transmitting some channels if TF1, controlled by conglomerate Bouygues ( BOUY.PA ), continued to demand fees for content that was available via other distributors for free.\nIt was not immediately clear how the conflict had been resolved.\nFrance’s Canal Plus pay-TV group, part of Vivendi ( VIV.PA ), had earlier this month said it was suspending broadcasts of TF1 channels, also citing “unreasonable” fees demanded of distributors.\nReporting by Sarah White, Editing by Matthias Blamont\n ",
