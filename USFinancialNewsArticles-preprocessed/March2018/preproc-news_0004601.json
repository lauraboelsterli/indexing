Please refer to our earnings presentation on investor.purestorage.com for further information on the adoption impact of ASC 606 on our results of operations.\nPure Storage's first quarter fiscal 2019 guidance is as follows:\nRevenue in the range of $246 million to $254 million Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 63.5% to 66.5% Non-GAAP operating margin in the range of -13.0% to -9.0%\nPure Storage's full year fiscal 2019 guidance is as follows:\nRevenue in the range of $1.310 billion to $1.360 billion Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 63.5% to 66.5% Non-GAAP operating margin in the range of 0% to 4%\nAll forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures contained in this section titled \"Financial Outlook\" exclude stock-based compensation expense, payroll tax expense related to stock-based activities and, as applicable, other special items. We have not reconciled guidance for non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating margin to their most directly comparable GAAP measures because such items that impact these measures are not within our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.\nConference Call Information\nPure Storage will host a teleconference to discuss the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2018 results at 2:00 p.m. (PT) on March 1, 2018.

Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted include, among others, those risks and uncertainties included under the captions \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in our filings and reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including, which are available on our investor relations website at investor.purestorage.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov . Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2018. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of March 1, 2018, and we undertake no duty to update this information unless required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income (loss), non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP net income (loss) per share, free cash flow, and free cash flow as a percentage of revenue. In computing these non-GAAP financial measures, we exclude the effects of stock-based compensation expense and payroll tax expense related to stock-based activities. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain expenses and expenditures such as stock-based compensation expense that may not be indicative of our ongoing core business operating results. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when analyzing historical performance and liquidity and planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nFor a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures, please see the tables captioned \"Reconciliations of non-GAAP results of operations to the nearest comparable GAAP measures\" and \"Reconciliation from net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow,\" included at the end of this
