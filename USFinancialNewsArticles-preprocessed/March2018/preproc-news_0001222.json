    "text": "0 COMMENTS Aqeela Sherrills came-of-age in 1970s and ‘80s South Central Los Angeles, then one of America’s toughest and deadliest cities. To survive being physically challenged almost daily in the Jordan Downs housing projects, he joined a gang, where he says he found an almost family-like source of support and protection.\nBut after seeing droves of family members and friends shot and killed, Mr. Sherrills headed to college, hoping to forge a safer path for himself. He says a “transformative experience” while there led him to head back home to become a peace activist with the mission of fighting crime and violence and helping his L.A. community heal from trauma.\nThis video tells the story of an encounter with street violence that affected Mr. Sherrills more personally than ever, and how his response to that tragedy led him to where he is today.",
