    "text": "Q4 2017 Revenue Grows 6.1%\n- Revenue Growth Rate and Margin Expansion Through the Year -\nNEW YORK, March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Reis, Inc. (NASDAQ:REIS) (“Reis” or the “Company”), a leading provider of commercial real estate market information and analytical tools, announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenue of $12.2 million, up 6.1% fourth quarter 2017 over 2016; subscription revenue of $11.8 million, up 4.4% quarter-over-quarter Income before income taxes of $1.0 million for fourth quarter 2017, or 8.5% of total revenue, compared to a (loss) before income taxes of $(141,000) in the corresponding 2016 period Net loss of $(4.5) million, or $(0.40) per diluted share for fourth quarter 2017, inclusive of a one-time deferred tax asset reduction of $5.1 million as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted by the U.S. Federal government on December 22, 2017 Reis Services EBITDA of $4.3 million, up 62.4% fourth quarter 2017 over 2016; consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $3.8 million, up 63.8% quarter-over-quarter Quarter ended with nearly $20 million in cash and no debt Deferred revenue ended 2017 at $26.5 million, Reis’s highest reported balance and a year-over-year increase of $1.5 million\nReis’s CEO, Lloyd Lynford, noted, “Total revenue grew and our margins again increased sequentially in the fourth quarter, as has been the case throughout 2017. Our improving financial performance is a direct result of the deliberate and measured investments we have made in our operations, database, and website over the past few years. These investments have positioned us to expand our offerings and attract new firms and user groups to our services. Over the course of 2017 and thus far in 2018, we have unveiled a series of new products and product enhancements that significantly expand our target market and lay the groundwork for future growth. In particular, we believe our “Every Property, Everywhere” initiative and our API delivery system have opened up substantial new revenue opportunities with existing clients and prospects, as well as with emerging Fintech companies.”\nFourth Quarter and 2017 Financial Summary\nRevenue\nTotal revenue was $12.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, growth of 6.1% over the fourth quarter 2016 reported amount of $11.5 million. Total revenue in the 2017 fourth quarter was comprised of subscription revenue of $11.8 million and other revenue of $0.4 million. Total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2017 was $48.2 million, a moderate increase of 1.4% from the 2016 reported amount. Total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was comprised of $46.8 million of subscription revenue and $1.4 million of other revenue. Subscription revenue for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 grew 4.4% and 3.1%, respectively, over the corresponding 2016 periods. The fourth quarter 2017 marks the sixth consecutive quarter over quarter growth in subscription revenue and the third consecutive quarter over quarter growth in total revenue.\nTotal operating expenses\nTotal operating expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $8.2 million compared to $8.5 million for the corresponding period last year. The decrease was driven primarily by a decline in sales and marketing expenses of $292,000, and a $187,000 decline in general and administrative expense as a result of reduced legal fees and lower occupancy costs. Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $33.1 million compared to $31.7 million for the prior year. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in sales and marketing expenses of $747,000 as a result of higher employment costs associated with new hires in sales management, sales enablement and marketing and a $529,000 increase in product development expense as a result of the Company’s investment in its websites and databases.\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\nIncome before income taxes was $1.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a loss of $(0.1) million for the corresponding 2016 period. Income before income taxes was $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to income before income taxes of $4.7 million for the corresponding 2016 period.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $5.6 million compared to $89,000 for the corresponding period last year. The fourth quarter of 2017 tax expense was primarily driven by corporate Federal tax reform that was signed into law in December 2017. The Company remeasured its deferred tax assets as a result of the Federal corporate tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% and recorded a provisional estimate of $5.1 million at December 31, 2017 to reduce the deferred tax asset balance.\nNet income (loss)\nThe Company’s net loss was $(4.5) million, or $(0.40) per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a loss of $(0.2) million, or $(0.02) per diluted share, for the corresponding 2016 period. The Company’s net loss was $(3.2) million, or $(0.28) per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to net income of $2.8 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the corresponding 2016 annual period.\nReis Services EBITDA and Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA\nReis Services EBITDA was $4.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, growth of 62.4% over the fourth quarter 2016 reported amount of $2.7 million. The Reis Services EBITDA margins were 35.3% and 23.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively (see the “Supplemental Financial Information and Reconciliations from GAAP to Non-GAAP Metrics” section at the end of this earnings release for a definition and reconciliations of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the Reis Services segment and on a consolidated basis). Reis Services EBITDA was $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a slight decline of (2.6)% from the 2016 reported amount of $15.5 million. The Reis Services EBITDA margins were 31.4% and 32.7% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA was $3.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, growth of 63.8%, from the fourth quarter 2016 amount. The consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margins were 30.9% and 20.0% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $12.8 million, a decline of (5.3)% from the comparable 2016 reported amount of $13.5 million. The consolidated Adjusted EBITDA margins were 26.6% and 28.5% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nSubsequent to the End of the Quarter\nExpanded coverage to all commercial properties nationwide in “Every Property, Everywhere” initiative Announced early success in sales of Application Programing Interface (“API”) delivery system Increased coverage of the self storage sector to 125 markets Increased regular quarterly cash dividend by 11.8% to $0.19 per share\nBalance Sheet, Liquidity and Other Metrics\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents of $19.7 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to $21.5 million as of December 31, 2016.\nInvestments in the Company’s website and database intangible assets totaled $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. These investments are in support of the Company’s continuing strategy to provide more granular data at the property level, which has resulted in “Every Sale, Everywhere” and “Every Property, Everywhere.”\nThe Company’s Board of Directors, declared and the Company paid, quarterly dividends to shareholders of $1.96 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and $7.88 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, or a rate of $0.17 per share for each of the four quarters of 2017.\nThe Company repurchased 13,111 shares of its common stock at an average price of $18.57 per share in the fourth quarter and 182,028 shares at an average price of $18.80 per share for the year, leaving approximately $0.4 million available under its existing program to purchase additional shares.\nDeferred revenue was $26.5 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to $25.0 million as of December 31, 2016. Aggregate Revenue Under Contract was $52.0 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to $51.0 million as of December 31, 2016. (see the “Supplemental Financial Information and Reconciliations from GAAP to Non-GAAP Metrics” section at the end of this earnings release for a definition and reconciliations of Deferred revenue to Aggregate Revenue Under Contract). The forward twelve-month component of Aggregate Revenue Under Contract was $35.9 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to $34.8 million as of December 31, 2016. Each of these metrics demonstrates strong visibility into future revenue.\nThe Company’s base renewal rate, including price increases, was 88.3% for the year ended December 31, 2017. These rates are improved from the renewal rate, including price increases, reported for the year ended December 31, 2016 of 85.7%.\nAdditional Information\nThis press release should be read in conjunction with the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 8, 2018.

Other important metrics that management considers include cash flow generation as well as the visibility into future performance as supported by our deferred revenue and other related metrics discussed in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFollowing is a presentation of revenue, net income (loss), income before income taxes and discontinued operations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and the related margins on a consolidated basis and revenue, EBITDA and EBITDA margin for the Reis Services segment (see below for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for both the Reis Services segment and on a consolidated basis for each of the periods presented here).\n(amounts in thousands, excluding percentages)\nFor the Three Months Ended\nPercentage December 31,\nIncrease\nIncrease 2017 2016 (Decrease)\n(Decrease) Consolidated: Total revenue $ 12,263 $ 11,554 $ 709 6.1 % Net (loss) $ (4,548 ) $ (230 ) $ (4,318 ) (1,877.4 )% Income (loss) before income taxes and discontinued\noperations $ 1,038 $ (141 ) $ 1,179 836.2 % EBITDA $ 3,229 $ 1,791 $ 1,438 80.3 % EBITDA margin 26.3 % 15.5 % Adjusted EBITDA $ 3,784 $ 2,310 $ 1,474 63.8 % Adjusted EBITDA margin 30.9 % 20.0 % Reis Services segment: Total revenue $ 12,263 $ 11,554 $ 709 6.1 % EBITDA $ 4,328 $ 2,665 $ 1,663 62.4 % EBITDA margin 35.3 % 23.1 % (amounts in thousands, excluding percentages)\nFor the Years Ended\nPercentage\nDecember 31,\nIncrease\nIncrease\n2017 2016 (Decrease)\n(Decrease) Consolidated: Total revenue $ 48,190 $ 47,530 $ 660 1.4 % Net (loss) income $ (3,158 ) $ 2,781 $ (5,939 ) (213.6 )% Income before income taxes and discontinued operations $ 2,433 $ 4,734 $ (2,301 ) (48.6 )% EBITDA $ 10,616 $ 11,450 $ (834 ) (7.3 )% EBITDA margin 22.0 % 24.1 % Adjusted EBITDA $ 12,827 $ 13,549 $ (722 ) (5.3 )% Adjusted EBITDA margin 26.6 % 28.5 % Reis Services segment: Total revenue $ 48,190 $ 47,530 $ 660 1.4 % EBITDA $ 15,134 $ 15,537 $ (403 ) (2.6 )% EBITDA margin 31.4 % 32.7 % Revenue Performance\nIn order to provide additional insight into our revenue, we have disaggregated total revenue into two components: “Subscription” and “Other.” Other revenue specifically includes revenue related to contracts for one-time custom data deliverables and one-time fees for settlements of previous unauthorized usage of Reis data.

Reconciliations of Net Income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nWe define EBITDA as earnings (net income (loss)) before discontinued operations, interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before discontinued operations, interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation. Although EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, senior management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to measure operational and management performance. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate supplemental financial measures to be considered in addition to the reported GAAP basis financial information, which may assist investors in evaluating and understanding: (1) the performance of the Reis Services segment, the primary business of the Company and (2) the Company’s continuing consolidated results, from year to year or period to period, as applicable. Further, these measures provide the reader with the ability to understand our operational performance while isolating non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization expenses, as well as other non-operating items, such as interest income, interest expense and income taxes and, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, isolates non-cash charges for stock-based compensation. Management also believes that disclosing EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA will provide better comparability to other companies in the information services sector. However, because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are presented both for the Reis Services segment and on a consolidated basis. We believe that these metrics, for Reis Services, provide the reader with valuable information for evaluating the financial performance of the core Reis Services business, excluding public company costs, and for making assessments about the intrinsic value of that stand-alone business to a potential acquirer. Management primarily monitors and measures its performance, and is compensated, based on the results of the Reis Services segment. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, on a consolidated basis, allow the reader to make assessments about the current trading value of the Company’s common stock, including expenses related to operating as a public company. However, investors should not consider these measures in isolation or as substitutes for net income (loss), income from continuing operations, operating income, or any other measure for determining operating performance that is calculated in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable GAAP financial measure, income from continuing operations, follow for each identified period on a segment basis (including the Reis Services segment), as well as on a consolidated basis:\n(amounts in thousands)\nReconciliation of Net (Loss) to EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 By Segment Reis Services Other (A) Consolidated Net (loss) $ (4,548 ) Income tax expense 5,586 Income (loss) before income taxes and discontinued operations $ 2,136 $ (1,098 ) 1,038 Add back: Depreciation and amortization expense 2,159 — 2,159 Interest expense (income), net 33 (1 ) 32 EBITDA 4,328 (1,099 ) 3,229 Add back: Stock based compensation expense, net — 555 555 Adjusted EBITDA $ 4,328 $ (544 ) $ 3,784\nReconciliation of Net (Loss) to EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 By Segment Reis Services Other (A) Consolidated Net (loss) $ (3,158 ) Income tax expense 5,591 Income (loss) before income taxes and discontinued operations $ 6,949 $ (4,516 ) 2,433 Add back: Depreciation and amortization expense 8,056 — 8,056 Interest expense (income), net 129 (2 ) 127 EBITDA 15,134 (4,518 ) 10,616 Add back: Stock based compensation expense, net — 2,211 2,211 Adjusted EBITDA $ 15,134 $ (2,307 ) $ 12,827\nReconciliation of Net (Loss) to EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 By Segment Reis Services Other (A) Consolidated Net (loss) $ (230 ) Income tax expense 89 Income (loss) before income taxes and discontinued operations $ 733 $ (874 ) (141 ) Add back: Depreciation and amortization expense 1,905 — 1,905 Interest expense (income), net 27 — 27 EBITDA 2,665 (874 ) 1,791 Add back: Stock based compensation expense, net — 519 519 Adjusted EBITDA $ 2,665 $ (355 ) $ 2,310\nReconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA and\nAdjusted EBITDA for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 By Segment Reis Services Other (A) Consolidated Net income $ 2,781 Income tax expense 1,953 Income (loss) before income taxes and discontinued operations $ 8,827 $ (4,093 ) 4,734 Add back: Depreciation and amortization expense 6,624 6 6,630 Interest expense (income), net 86 — 86 EBITDA 15,537 (4,087 ) 11,450 Add back: Stock based compensation expense, net — 2,099 2,099 Adjusted EBITDA $ 15,537 $ (1,988 ) $ 13,549 (A) Includes interest and other income, depreciation expense and general and administrative expenses (including public company related costs) that are not\nassociated with the Reis Services segment.\nDeferred Revenue and Aggregate Revenue Under Contract\nTwo balance-sheet based metrics management utilizes are deferred revenue and Aggregate Revenue Under Contract. Analyzing these amounts can provide additional insight into Reis Services’s future financial performance. Deferred revenue, which is a GAAP basis accounting concept and is reported by the Company on the consolidated balance sheet, represents revenue from annual or longer term contracts for which we have billed and/or received payments from our subscribers related to services we will be providing over the remaining contract period. Aggregate Revenue Under Contract is the sum of deferred revenue and future revenue under non-cancellable contracts for which we do not yet have the contractual right to bill and excludes any future revenues expected to be derived from subscribers currently being billed on a monthly basis.\nDeferred revenue will be recognized as revenue ratably over the remaining life of a contract for subscriptions, or in the case of future custom reports or projects, will be recognized as revenue upon completion and delivery to the customer, provided no significant Company obligations remain. At any given date, both deferred revenue and Aggregate Revenue Under Contract can be either positively or negatively influenced by: (1) the timing and dollar value of contracts signed and billed; (2) the quantity and timing of contracts that are multi-year; and (3) the impact of recording revenue ratably over the life of a multi-year contract, which moderates the effect of price increases after the first year. The following table reconciles deferred revenue to Aggregate Revenue Under Contract at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 Deferred revenue (GAAP basis) $ 26,534,000 $ 25,031,000 Amounts under non-cancellable contracts for which the\nCompany does not yet have the contractual right to bill at\nthe period end (A) 25,470,000 25,928,000 Aggregate Revenue Under Contract $ 52,004,000 $ 50,959,000\n(A) Amounts are billable subsequent to December 31 of each year and represent (i) non-cancellable contracts\nfor subscribers with multi-year subscriptions where the future years are not yet billable, or (ii) subscribers\nwith non-cancellable annual subscriptions with interim billing terms. Included in Aggregate Revenue Under Contract at December 31, 2017 was approximately $35,878,000 related to amounts under contract for the forward twelve-month period through December 31, 2018. The remainder reflects amounts under contract beyond December 31, 2018. The forward twelve-month Aggregate Revenue Under Contract amount is approximately 74.5% of total revenue on a trailing twelve month basis at December 31, 2017. For comparison purposes, at December 31, 2016 and 2015, the forward twelve-month Aggregate Revenue Under Contract was $34,778,000 and $33,822,000, respectively, and as a percentage of that year’s total revenue was approximately 73.2% and 66.5%, respectively.\nSource:Reis, Inc",
