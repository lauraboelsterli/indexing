    "text": "37 COMMENTS Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin asked the University of California, Los Angeles not to post a video of his recent public appearance at which he was heckled by students.\nMr. Mnuchin, who worked as a Hollywood movie producer before joining President Donald Trump’s administration, visited UCLA’s Burkle Center on Monday afternoon for a moderated discussion about the economy.\nProtesters handed out fliers outside the event, saying Mr. Mnuchin wasn’t welcome on campus. Hecklers in the audience hissed and coughed throughout the conversation, which was led by Kai Ryssdal, host of the Marketplace radio program.\nMr. Mnuchin said it was his first time speaking at a university. He addressed the opposition lightheartedly early in the talk by saying, “I normally go [speak to] people who wanna listen to me speak.”\nHe tried to joke that the hecklers would wear out before he does, then said, “Oh yeah, I’m dealing with students, I forgot.”\nOne person urged him to ignore the hissing, and others applauded during the remarks.\nMr. Mnuchin, appearing agitated, stopped the conversation several times, asking the hecklers either to identify themselves or explain what they were protesting. One person in the audience shouted: “I think you’re full of shit.”\nHe also faced tough questions on the tax-overhaul plan and sanctions from Mr. Ryssdal, whom he challenged several times and accused of being biased.\nThe event was open to the public, and a UCLA spokeswoman said Monday a video would be posted to its website this week.\nUCLA spokeswoman Peggy McInerny wrote in an email on Tuesday that Mr. Mnuchin “has retracted his permission for the Burkle Center to post its video and podcast of yesterday’s event on its website, so we are unable to share either recording with you.”\nA spokeswoman for Mr. Mnuchin didn’t dispute that he requested the university not post the video of the event.\nMr. Mnuchin “welcomed the chance to speak and discuss important economic issues,” the spokeswoman said. “The event was open to the media and a transcript was published. He believes healthy debate is critical to ensuring the right policies that do the most good are advanced.”\nMarketplace posted an edited transcript of the interview and a partial audio recording of the event to its website. \nWrite to Kate Davidson at kate.davidson@wsj.com and Nour Malas at nour.malas@wsj.com",
