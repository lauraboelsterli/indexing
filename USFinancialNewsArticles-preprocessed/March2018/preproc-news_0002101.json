    "text": "SPRINGFIELD, Mass., March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- American Outdoor Brands Corporation (NASDAQ Global Select: AOBC), one of the world's leading providers of firearms and quality products for the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor enthusiast, today announced financial results for the third quarter fiscal 2018, ended January 31, 2018.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Highlights\nQuarterly net sales were $157.4 million, compared with $233.5 million for the third quarter last year, a decrease of 32.6%. Gross margin for the quarter was 29.8%, compared with 42.5% for the third quarter last year. Quarterly GAAP net income was $11.4 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared with net income of $32.5 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, for the comparable quarter last year. Included in the January 31, 2018 results is an estimated, one-time, income tax benefit of $9.4 million resulting from the impact of Tax Reform on deferred tax assets and liabilities. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $4.7 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared with $37.6 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, for the comparable quarter last year. GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments to net income exclude a number of acquisition-related costs, including amortization, fair value inventory step-up and backlog expense, one-time transition costs, corporate rebranding expenses, changes in contingent consideration, the impact of Tax Reform, and discontinued operations, as well as the associated tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments. For a detailed reconciliation, see the schedules that follow in this release. Quarterly non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDAS was $20.0 million, or 12.7% of net sales, compared with $67.6 million, or 28.9% of net sales, for the comparable quarter last year.\nJames Debney, American Outdoor Brands Corporation President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"Our results for the third quarter reflected a continuation of challenging market conditions in the consumer market for firearms. Lower shipments in our Firearms business were driven by a reduction in wholesaler and retailer orders versus the prior year, and were partially offset by double-digit revenue growth within our Outdoor Products and Accessories segment. Overall, our long-term strategy remains focused on being the leading provider of quality products for the shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor enthusiast.\n\"While our new product pipeline is robust and channel inventory levels appear to be improving, we believe that the new, lower levels of consumer firearm demand we saw reflected in the January NICS results may continue for some time. Going forward, we will operate our business under the assumption that the next 12-18 months could deliver flattish revenues in Firearms. Should market conditions change, our flexible manufacturing model would allow us to quickly ramp production. In the meantime, we will continue to focus on organic growth in our Outdoor Products and Accessories business and on company-wide cost reduction efforts. At the same time, we will continue to invest in our new distribution center, an important strategic initiative designed to lower our overall cost structure,\" concluded Debney.\nJeff Buchanan, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Administrative Officer, commented, \"We ended the quarter with cash of $38.2 million and net debt of approximately $200 million. Our focus on reducing production levels during the quarter helped to lower inventories of our firearms – internally and at distributor locations. Cash flow for the quarter was positive, so during the quarter we utilized $50 million in cash to reduce our outstanding line of credit, and subsequent to the end of the quarter we paid down an additional $25 million. In addition, yesterday, we effectively extended the maturity on our $75 million Senior Notes to August 2020. Thus, our balance sheet remains strong with no short-term debt and we anticipate positive cash flow for our fiscal fourth quarter.\"\nFinancial Outlook\nAMERICAN OUTDOOR BRANDS CORPORATION\nNET SALES AND EARNINGS PER SHARE GUIDANCE, INCLUDING GAAP TO NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION\n(Unaudited)\nRange for the Three Months Ending April 30, 2018\nRange for the Year Ending April 30, 2018\nNet sales (in thousands)\n$ 162,000\n$ 166,000\n$ 597,000\n$ 601,000\nGAAP income per share - diluted\n$ 0.01\n$ 0.03\n$ 0.24\n$ 0.26\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets\n0.10\n0.10\n0.38\n0.38\nAcquisition-related costs\n—\n—\n0.01\n0.01\nTransition costs\n—\n—\n0.01\n0.01\nChange in contingent consideration\n—\n—\n(0.02)\n(0.02)\nTax Reform\n0.02\n0.02\n(0.15)\n(0.15)\nTax effect of non-GAAP adjustments\n(0.04)\n(0.04)\n(0.16)\n(0.16)\nNon-GAAP income per share - diluted\n$ 0.09\n$ 0.11\n$ 0.31\n$ 0.33\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe company will host a conference call and webcast today, March 1, 2018, to discuss its third quarter fiscal 2018 financial and operational results.

From time-to-time, we consider and use these supplemental measures of operating performance in order to provide the reader with an improved understanding of underlying performance trends. We believe it is useful for our company and the reader to review, as applicable, both (1) GAAP measures that include (i) amortization of acquired intangible assets, (ii) transition costs, (iii) discontinued operations, (iv) changes in contingent consideration liabilities, (v) acquisition-related costs, (vi) inventory step-up and backlog expense, (vii) Tax Reform, (viii) tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments, (ix) net cash (used in)/provided by operating activities, (x) net cash used in investing activities, (xi) receipts from note receivable, (xii) interest expense (xiii) income tax (benefit)/expense, (xiv) depreciation and amortization, (xv) corporate rebranding costs, and (xv) stock-based compensation expense; and (2) the non-GAAP measures that exclude such information. We present these non-GAAP measures because we consider them an important supplemental measure of our performance. Our definition of these adjusted financial measures may differ from similarly named measures used by others. We believe these measures facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by eliminating potential differences caused by the existence and timing of certain expense items that would not otherwise be apparent on a GAAP basis. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our GAAP measures. The principal limitations of these measures are that they do not reflect our actual expenses and may thus have the effect of inflating our financial measures on a GAAP basis.\nAbout American Outdoor Brands Corporation\nAmerican Outdoor Brands Corporation (NASDAQ Global Select: AOBC) is a provider of quality products for shooting, hunting, and rugged outdoor enthusiasts in the global consumer and professional markets.
