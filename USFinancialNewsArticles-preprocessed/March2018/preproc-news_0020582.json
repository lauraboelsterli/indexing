    "text": "NEW YORK, March 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Silvercrest Asset Management Group Inc. (NASDAQ: SAMG) (the \"Company\" or \"Silvercrest\") today reported the results of its operations for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nBusiness Update\nSilvercrest achieved record revenues and assets under management to conclude the fourth quarter and full year 2017. Our total assets under management increased by $0.7 billion during the fourth quarter, driven by capital markets performance and net new client organic growth. Silvercrest concluded 2017 with discretionary assets under management of $16.0 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 16% and a new high. Silvercrest's total assets under management stood at $21.3 billion as of year end.\nSilvercrest's results have been driven by continued execution of our disciplined growth strategy, and the fourth quarter of 2017 represented the firm's ninth straight quarter of net organic growth. Silvercrest has delivered 18 quarters of positive or breakeven asset flows, with 15 of those quarters being positive.\nSilvercrest has maintained its adjusted EBITDA margins while investing in the business on behalf of clients and future growth. We continue to invest in Silvercrest's next generation of high-quality talent and have funded new growth initiatives, including our previously announced OCIO business.\nSilvercrest's proprietary value equity strategies continued their strong long-term performance in 2017. Each of the firm's six primary equity strategies have outperformed their relevant benchmarks for nearly all measured periods, as well as since inception. Silvercrest's performance supports continued opportunity in the institutional marketplace and presents a compelling and competitive offering to high net worth clients and prospects.\nSilvercrest continues to evaluate selective and prudent acquisitions to complement our organic growth, capabilities and professional talent, including the potential to expand in new geographies.\nAll of us at Silvercrest are grateful for the long-term support of our clients and shareholders.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nTotal Assets Under Management (\"AUM\") of $21.3 billion, inclusive of discretionary AUM of $16.0 billion and non-discretionary AUM of $5.3 billion at December 31, 2017. Revenue of $24.5 million. U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") consolidated net income and net (loss) attributable to Silvercrest of $1.9 million and ($80) thousand, respectively. Included in the net loss attributable to Silvercrest is a $7.3 million write off of deferred tax assets reported as income tax expense and a $5.3 million reduction to our tax receivable agreement reported in other income as a result of the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate. Basic and diluted net loss per share of $(0.01). Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\") 1 of $7.6 million. Adjusted net income 1 of $3.6 million. Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share 1, 2 of $0.27 and $0.26, respectively.\nThe table below presents a comparison of certain GAAP and non-GAAP (\"adjusted\") financial measures and AUM.\nFor the Three Months\nEnded December 31,\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n(in thousands except per share amounts or as indicated)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nRevenue\n$\n24,471\n$\n21,192\n$\n91,358\n$\n80,262\nIncome before other income (expense), net\n$\n5,152\n$\n3,326\n$\n20,369\n$\n14,636\nNet income\n$\n1,917\n$\n2,487\n$\n12,531\n$\n9,982\nNet (loss) income attributable to Silvercrest\n$\n(80)\n$\n1,286\n$\n5,337\n$\n5,015\nNet (loss) income per basic and diluted share\n$\n(0.01)\n$\n0.15\n$\n0.66\n$\n0.62\nAdjusted EBITDA 1\n$\n7,597\n$\n5,889\n$\n27,887\n$\n22,453\nAdjusted EBITDA margin 1\n31.0\n%\n27.8\n%\n30.5\n%\n28.0\n%\nAdjusted net income 1\n$\n3,620\n$\n2,632\n$\n13,064\n$\n9,836\nAdjusted basic earnings per share 1, 2\n$\n0.27\n$\n0.20\n$\n0.99\n$\n0.76\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share 1, 2\n$\n0.26\n$\n0.19\n$\n0.95\n$\n0.72\nAssets under management at period end (billions)\n$\n21.3\n$\n18.6\n$\n21.3\n$\n18.6\nAverage assets under management (billions) 3\n$\n21.0\n$\n18.3\n$\n20.0\n$\n18.4\nDiscretionary assets under management (billions)\n$\n16.0\n$\n13.8\n$\n16.0\n$\n13.8\nAUM Increased to $21.3 billion\nSilvercrest's discretionary assets under management increased by $2.2 billion, or 15.9%, to $16.0 billion at December 31, 2017 from $13.8 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase was attributable to market appreciation of $1.6 billion and net client inflows of $0.6 billion. Silvercrest's total AUM increased by $2.7 billion, or 14.5%, to $21.3 billion at December 31, 2017 from $18.6 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase was attributable to market appreciation of $2.1 billion and net client inflows of $0.6 billion.\nFourth Quarter 2017 vs. Fourth Quarter 2016\nRevenue increased by $3.3 million, or 15.6%, to $24.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, from $21.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. This increase was driven primarily by growth in our management and advisory fees as a result of increased AUM and performance fees earned.\nTotal expenses increased by $1.5 million, or 8.1%, to $19.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $17.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Compensation and benefits expense increased by $0.9 million, or 6.7%, to $14.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $13.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the accrual for bonuses of $0.8 million and an increase in salary expense of $0.1 million as a result of both merit-based increases and increased headcount. General and administrative expenses increased by $0.6 million, or 12.9%, to $4.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $4.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to an increase in occupancy and related costs of $0.4 million, an increase in professional fees of $0.2 million, an increase in sub-advisory fees of $0.3 million as a result of increased sub-advised revenue, an increase in travel and entertainment expenses of $0.1 million and an increase in depreciation and amortization of $0.1 million, partially offset by a change in the fair value of estimated earnout payments of $0.2 million and a decrease in bad debt expense of $0.3 million.\nConsolidated net income was $1.9 million or 7.8% of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $2.5 million or 11.7% of revenue for the same period in the prior year. Net loss attributable to Silvercrest was ($0.1) million, or ($0.01) per basic and diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Included in the $(0.1) million net loss attributable to Silvercrest for the quarter are approximately $2.0 million of net charges related to the partial write offs of deferred tax assets and the tax receivable agreement liability as a result of the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate. Our Adjusted Net Income 1 was $3.6 million, or $0.27 per adjusted basic share and $0.26 per adjusted diluted share 2 for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 was $7.6 million or 31.0% of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $5.9 million or 27.8% of revenue for the same period in the prior year.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue increased by $11.1 million, or 13.8%, to $91.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $80.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was driven primarily by growth in our management and advisory fees as a result of increased assets under management and performance fees earned.\nTotal expenses increased by $5.4 million, or 8.2%, to $71.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $65.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in compensation and benefits expense of $5.1 million and an increase in general and administrative expenses of $0.2 million. The increase in compensation and benefits expense was primarily attributable to an increase in the accrual for bonuses of $4.3 million, an increase in benefits costs of $0.1 million and an increase in salaries expense of $0.7 million primarily as a result of merit-based increases. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in occupancy and related costs of $0.6 million, an increase in professional fees of $0.2 million, an increase in travel and related expenses of $0.2 million, an increase in insurance costs of $0.1 million, an increase in sub-advisory and referral fees of $0.1 million related to increased sub-advised revenue and an increase in depreciation and amortization of $0.1 million. This was partially offset by a decrease in investment research costs of $0.5 million mainly due to a reduction in soft dollar-related research cost conversions, a decrease in business taxes of $0.1 million, a decrease in client reimbursements of $0.1 million, a decrease in the fair value of earnout payments related to the acquisitions of Milbank Winthrop & Co. (\"Milbank\") and Jamison, Eaton and Wood, Inc. (\"Jamison\") of $0.3 million and a decrease in office expenses of $0.1 million.\nConsolidated net income was $12.5 million or 13.7% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $10.0 million or 12.4% of revenue for the same period in the prior year. Net income attributable to Silvercrest was $5.3 million, or $0.66 per basic and diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2017. Included in the $5.3 million net income attributable to Silvercrest for 2017 are approximately $2.0 million of net charges related to the partial write offs of deferred tax assets and the tax receivable agreement liability as a result of the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate.\nSilvercrest's Adjusted Net Income 1 was $13.1 million, or $0.99 and $0.95 per adjusted basic and diluted share 2 , respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 was $27.9 million or 30.5% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $22.5 million or 28.0% of revenue for the same period in the prior year.\n1 Adjusted measures are non-GAAP measures and are explained and reconciled to the comparable GAAP\nmeasures in Exhibits 3 and 4.\n2 Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share measures for the year ended December 31, 2017 are based on\nthe number of shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock outstanding as of December 31,\n2017. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are further based on the addition of unvested deferred equity units,\nrestricted stock units, and performance units to the extent dilutive at the end of the reporting period.\n3 We have computed average AUM by averaging AUM at the beginning of the applicable period and AUM at the\nend of the applicable period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents were $53.8 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $37.5 million at December 31, 2016. Silvercrest L.P. had notes payable of $0.7 million at December 31, 2017 and $2.5 million at December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, there was nothing outstanding on our revolving credit facility with City National Bank.\nTotal Silvercrest Asset Management Group Inc.'s equity was $49.1 million at December 31, 2017. We had 8,142,120 shares of Class A common stock outstanding and 5,059,319 shares of Class B common stock outstanding at December 31, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo provide investors with additional insight, promote transparency and allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, we supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a basis consistent with GAAP with Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Earnings Per Share which are non-GAAP financial measures of earnings. These adjustments, and the non-GAAP financial measures that are derived from them, provide supplemental information to analyze our operations between periods and over time. Investors should consider our non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nEBITDA represents net income before provision for income taxes, interest income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA without giving effect to the Delaware franchise tax, professional fees associated with acquisitions or financing transactions, gains on extinguishment of debt or other obligations related to acquisitions, impairment charges and losses on disposals or abandonment of assets and leaseholds, client reimbursements and fund redemption costs, severance and other similar expenses, but including partner incentive allocations, prior to our initial public offering, as an expense. We feel that it is important to management and investors to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring earnings of the Company, taking into account earnings attributable to both Class A and Class B shareholders. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. We feel that it is important to management and investors to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted EBITDA Margin, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring profitability of the Company, taking into account profitability attributable to both Class A and Class B shareholders. Adjusted Net Income represents recurring net income without giving effect to professional fees associated with acquisitions or financing transactions, losses on forgiveness of notes receivable from our principals, gains on extinguishment of debt or other obligations related to acquisitions, impairment charges and losses on disposals or abandonment of assets and leaseholds, client reimbursements and fund redemption costs, severance and other similar expenses, but including partner incentive allocations, prior to our initial public offering, as an expense. Furthermore, Adjusted Net Income includes income tax expense assuming a blended corporate rate of 40%. We feel that it is important to management and investors to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring income of the Company, taking into account income attributable to both Class A and Class B shareholders. Adjusted Earnings Per Share represents Adjusted Net Income divided by the actual Class A and Class B shares outstanding as of the end of the reporting period for basic Adjusted Earnings Per Share, and to the extent dilutive, we add unvested deferred equity units, restricted stock units and performance units to the total shares outstanding to compute diluted Adjusted Earnings Per Share. As a result of our structure, which includes a non-controlling interest, we feel that it is important to management and investors to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis with Adjusted Earnings Per Share, a non-GAAP financial measure of earnings, as this measure provides a perspective of recurring earnings per share of the Company as a whole as opposed to being limited to our Class A common stock.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call on March 12, 2018, at 8:30 am (Eastern Time) to discuss these results.
