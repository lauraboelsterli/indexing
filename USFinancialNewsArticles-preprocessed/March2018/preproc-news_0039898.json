    "text": "31 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—Congressional leaders said they were nearing a final deal Wednesday morning over a spending bill that would fund the government until October, wrapping up the final stretch of talks that had delayed a deal for several days.\nThe top four congressional leaders left a meeting Wednesday saying they had to work out some details but expected the spending bill to be completed soon. Leaders from both parties said they felt confident about the underlying agreement.\n“We feel really good about where things are,” House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) told reporters. “We expect to post something very soon.”\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) expressed similar confidence.\n“There are a few more details to be worked out. We hope they’ll be done in the next few hours,” Mr. Schumer said. “We’re feeling very good about this.”\nAides had worked around the clock Monday and Tuesday to negotiate the spending bill, with time dwindling this week. The government’s current funding expires at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.\nLawmakers and President Donald Trump agreed to the bill’s $1.3 trillion funding level last month as part of a two-year budget deal. But they spent weeks wrestling with the details of how to divvy it up across federal agencies. Should the bill be finalized later Wednesday, lawmakers would have to sprint to pass it through both chambers to avoid what would be the third partial government shutdown of the year.\nAlthough a deal hadn’t been completed early Wednesday, more of its contents were emerging. One of the most contentious issues had been whether Congress would provide funds to deliver on Mr. Trump’s promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico. Democrats have opposed building a physical wall but supported beefing up border security.\nThe spending bill is expected to allocate $1.57 billion for border fencing and some related spending on the southwest border, according to two people familiar with the details. That includes $641 million for 33 miles of new border fencing and levee walls, which are spans of concrete with bollard fencing on top. That is about half the 60 miles of new barriers Mr. Trump had requested.\nThe compromise gives the administration more than it asked for in replacement fencing—a total of $696 million for about 60 miles, including 14 miles of replacement fencing that the president requested. Both new and replacement barriers must use existing technology, one person said, which would rule out the sort of solid concrete wall that some have envisioned.\nThe bill also includes a separate technology fund of about $1.2 billion that would pay for road construction at the border, hiring new border agents and other border security measures.\nNewsletter Sign-up The spending bill won’t include any provisions cutting off federal funding for so-called sanctuary cities, cities and other jurisdictions with policies in place limiting local cooperation with federal immigration authorities, two people said. The bill does not fund additional interior enforcement agents with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency requested by Mr. Trump, though the people familiar said there would be more ICE agents for other tasks.\nCongressional leaders were likely to include funding to strengthen election security to thwart Russian meddling in November’s midterm elections. The bill is expected to boost the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s funding for counter-intelligence efforts to fight Russian cyberattacks by $307 million and provide an additional $380 million for election technology grants to states.\nMore\nSpending Bill Would Fall Short of Trump’s Demands for New Fencing Sign Up: Capital Journal Daybreak newsletter That is far short, however, of the more than $3 billion that Congress provided to state and local governments to upgrade and modernize their election infrastructure after the 2000 election, when a final result was delayed by troubles counting ballots in Florida.\nGOP leaders have focused on the boost the spending bill would provide to the military. Under the budget agreement reached last month, funding for the military will be increased by $80 billion this fiscal year over spending limits set in 2011, although Congress has regularly agreed to lift federal funding since then.\n“This is really about how we build the 21st century military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) told reporters Tuesday. “We have 21st century threats, and our men and women in uniform need to be equipped and prepared to deal with these threats.”\nDemocrats, meanwhile, have emphasized the $63 billion boost domestic spending would get. The funding would go to help combat the opioid epidemic, fund medical research and infrastructure investments, among other provisions.\nThe bill is expected to include $2.8 billion for treatment, prevention and research into opioids.\nThe spending bill “follows through, as you know, on the bipartisan budget deal we struck in February,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) told reporters Tuesday. “And for the first time in a long time, will robustly fund our military and provide substantial investments in our middle class.”\nThe bill is expected to exclude some of the most contentious policy provisions , including an effort from Republicans to strip federal funding from Planned Parenthood Federation of America, a women’s health organization that provides abortion services.\nCongressional leaders had agreed last month to boost infrastructure spending by $20 billion over two years. In this spending bill, lawmakers are expected to direct $600 million to develop new high-speed broadband, provide $1 billion more to an airport-improvement program and lift spending for the Federal Highway Administration and Federal Railroad Administration.\nThe Census Department is expected to get a $1.3 billion increase over last year’s level.\nThe House was still expected to vote on the bill Thursday, forcing lawmakers to waive their normal requirements for how long a bill must be public before voting on it. Once the House has passed the spending bill, it would go to the Senate, where any one senator can block the chamber from speeding up its time-consuming procedures, as Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) did last month on the budget deal.\n“We all know that we’ve got a hard stop on Friday, and the closer you get to Friday, the more worried people become,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n—Byron Tau contributed to this article.\nWrite to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com , Natalie Andrews at Natalie.Andrews@wsj.com and Laura Meckler at laura.meckler@wsj.com",
