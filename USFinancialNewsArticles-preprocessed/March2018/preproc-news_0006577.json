    "text": "OLDSMAR, Fla., Feb. 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cryo-Cell International, Inc. (OTCQB:CCEL) (the “Company”), the world’s first private cord blood bank to separate and store stem cells in 1992, announced results for its fiscal year ended November 30, 2017.\nFinancial Results\nRevenue\nConsolidated revenues for fiscal 2017 were $25.4 million compared to approximately $23.1 million for fiscal 2016. The revenues for fiscal 2017 consisted of $24.0 million in processing and storage fee revenue, $1.0 million in licensee income, and $442,000 in product revenue compared to $21.8 million in processing and storage fee revenue, $1.0 million in licensee income and $350,000 in product revenue for fiscal 2016.\nNet Income (Loss)\nThe Company reported net income of $2.3 million in fiscal 2017 or $0.33 per basic share and $0.30 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of ($1.3) million, or ($0.16) per basic and diluted shares in fiscal 2016. Net income for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2017 principally resulted from the 10% increase in total revenues and an 8% decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses. This was partially offset by a 16% increase in cost of sales. The net loss in fiscal 2016 resulted from the cancellation of certain interests in the Florida Revenue Sharing Agreement and certain interests in the Texas Revenue Sharing Agreement resulting in loss on extinguishment of revenue sharing agreements in the amount of $2.3 million, goodwill and intangible assets impairment of $2.0 million, a 19% increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and a 3% increase in cost of sales. This was offset by a 10% increase in total revenue and an income tax benefit of $1,159,000.\nAbout Cryo-Cell International, Inc.\nFounded in 1989, Cryo-Cell International, Inc. is the world's first private cord blood bank.
