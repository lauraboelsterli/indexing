FILE PHOTO - Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) speaks to the media after a House Republican conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 6, 2018. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts Noting that the United States should focus on China’s metals sales that are “trans-shipped” through other countries at unfair prices, Ryan said: “I really think the best policy is to be surgical and specific.” Speaking to employees of Home Depot in Atlanta, Ryan, a Republican, added: “I’m just not a fan of broad-based, across-the-board tariffs because I think you’ll have a lot of unintended consequences. You’ll have a lot of collateral damage.” Reporting by Richard Cowan; Editing by Peter Cooney",
