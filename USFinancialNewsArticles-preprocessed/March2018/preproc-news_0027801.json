Notably, revenue from our transaction services business reached RMB3.87 billion, an increase of 149.6% year-over-year. Our media business continued its ongoing upturn during the year, as efforts across our three core strategic areas – traffic, conversion, and monetization – paid off. Advertising and subscription revenue achieved a strong close for the year with an 18.2% annual increase in the fourth quarter.\"\n\"In 2018, our strategic focus is three-fold: synergies within the Bitauto family, integration of content and user communities, technology and big data enabled enhancements. Firstly, in my dual role, I will seek to further activate synergies between Bitauto and Yixin, through allowing crossover of user accounts, aggregating data resources, and enabling shared sales and marketing activities among automakers and dealers across multiple Bitauto and Yixin channels. Secondly, we will more closely engage users by bridging multi-media content with user communities that foster both online interaction as well as offline activities, in order to increase user stickiness throughout the automotive research, purchasing and ownership cycle. Thirdly, we will continue to leverage our leading technology and data capabilities to bring value to our customers and users. Our recently launched Easy Partners dealer platform and AI assistant Elita have begun to enable higher transaction efficiency by producing stronger data sets, increasing buyer satisfaction and reducing the workload of sales professionals. With these clear competitive advantages, we are confident in maintaining our leadership as China's top online auto media and transaction services ecosystem.\"\nMs. Cynthia He, chief financial officer of Bitauto, said, \"As we continue to make healthy progress across our business lines, we are optimistic about Bitauto's profitability outlook for 2018. We expect to expand margins over the coming quarters as we drive cost saving synergies between Bitauto and Yixin, increased efficiencies in our media business, and economies of scale from Yixin.\"\nBitauto Fourth Quarter 2017 Results\nBitauto reported revenue of RMB2.69 billion (US$413.5 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017, representing a 53.8% increase from the corresponding period in 2016.

Non-GAAP income from operations is defined as income from operations excluding (i) share-based payments; (ii) amortization of intangible assets resulting from asset and business acquisitions; and (iii) professional expenses incurred for the initial public offering of Yixin and the issuance of preferred shares. Non-GAAP net income is defined as net income excluding (i) share-based payments; (ii) amortization of intangible assets resulting from asset and business acquisitions; (iii) professional expenses incurred for the initial public offering of Yixin and the issuance of preferred shares; (iv) share of amortization of equity investments' intangible assets not on their books; (v) impairment on equity investees; (vi) investment loss associated with non-cash investment matters; (vii) amortization of the BCF discount on the convertible notes; (viii) fair value adjustment of contingent considerations; and (ix) tax impact related to professional expenses incurred for the initial public offering of Yixin. Non-GAAP basic and diluted net income per ADS is defined as Non-GAAP net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of the parent company divided by basic and diluted weighted average number of ADS. These non-GAAP financial measures provide Bitauto's management with the ability to assess its operating results by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the performance of its business such as non-cash and non-recurring items. Bitauto believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors by understanding supplemental information used by management in its assessment of operating results.\nThe use of non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations. These non-GAAP measures exclude certain items that have been and will continue to be incurred in the future and are not reflected in the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for or superior to U.S. GAAP results. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures utilized by other companies since such other companies may not calculate such measures in the same manner as Bitauto does.\nReconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure is set forth at the end of this release.\nFor investor and
