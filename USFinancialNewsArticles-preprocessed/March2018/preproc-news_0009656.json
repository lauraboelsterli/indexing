    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, March 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Teespring, an ecommerce platform that powers 'micro-brands', plans to launch in Asia in mid-March. The aggressive move positions them to tap into the most engaged marketplace and fuel the company's next phase of growth.\nThroughout the last decade major western brands have established strongholds in Asia, with brands like Under Armour referencing the region as their 'hyper growth market'. Last quarter, Nike reported earnings of $378M in China alone, whilst Burberry sales in China doubled in 2017. Larger brands have proven the strength of the Asian consumer and paved the way for smaller businesses (usually only recognized by niche-communities) to enter the global marketplace.\nThe significant improvement in global fulfilment and shipping technology, the sharing of ideas through social media platforms and the speed at which ideas can be taken to market, combine to create an ideal global arena for commerce. As niche-communities continue to grow and transcend borders, micro-brands are finding a larger audience among global consumers.\nJouzas \"Joe\" Kaziukenas, the founder of Marketplace Pulse and leading global eCommerce expert summed up the size of the opportunity. \"In 2017, China surpassed one trillion dollars in e-commerce volume for the first time, more than twice as big as US e-commerce. In fact, the largest e-commerce marketplace company Alibaba which controls such sites as Taobao and Tmall transacted more sales than all of US e-commerce. Compared to the US, e-commerce in Asia is not a convenience feature, but instead an essential need.\"\nIn mid-2017, Teespring began building its own proprietary marketing technology, dubbed 'The Boosted Network', that helps micro-brand creators broadcast products to wider audiences through deep integrations, data science and machine learning. The Teespring team are also citing new relationships with JD.com, Tmall and Japanese marketplace Rakuten as an initial platform to allow them to market their products in Asia. With distribution channels firmly in place, the site boasts a wide range in product that appeals to an Asian audience - with clothing, shoes and jewelry as the top three categories for Chinese ecommerce in 2017.\nVP Commercial, Chris Lamontagne commented \"We have seen positive signs in helping automate marketing for our micro-brand creators and believe that adding these new relationships will unlock a totally new customer base.\"\nABOUT TEESPRING:\nTeespring allows, micro-brand creators such as, designers, artists, entrepreneurs and content creators to design, market and sell their own merchandise online using a pre-commerce model, meaning that the micro-brand creator takes on zero risk. No customer service or supply chain and most importantly no upfront cost. The company offers deep product inventory filled with highly customized designs that spans across apparel, athleisure, home decor and personal accessories.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/teespring-looks-to-asia-for-the-next-phase-of-growth-300608408.html\nSOURCE Teespring",
