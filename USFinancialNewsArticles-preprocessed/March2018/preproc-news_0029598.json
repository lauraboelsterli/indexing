    "text": "Update on PURE’s Food Safety Solutions Outlook for Calendar 2018\nSAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PURE Bioscience, Inc. ( OTCQB: PURE ) , creator of the patented non-toxic silver dihydrogen citrate ( SDC ) antimicrobial, today reported financial results for the fiscal second quarter and six-month period ended January 31, 2018.\nQ2: Summary of Results of Operations\nRevenues for the fiscal second quarter ended January 31, 2018 decreased 8% to $411,000, compared with revenues of $447,000 in the prior year fiscal second quarter. The decrease was due to fluctuations within our existing legacy customer base. Core food safety revenues for the fiscal second quarter ended 2018 increased 55% as compared with food safety revenues in the fiscal second quarter ended 2017. Net loss for the fiscal second quarter in 2018 was $2.0 million, as compared with $936,000 for fiscal second quarter in 2017. Net loss, excluding derivative income, and share-based compensation, for the second fiscal quarter in 2018 was $1.3 million, as compared with $1.2 million for the second quarter in 2017. Net loss per share was ($0.03) as compared with ($0.01) for the fiscal second quarter ended 2018 and 2017. Gross margin was 67% during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared with 70% during the same period in fiscal 2017. The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the sale of lower margin formulations and packaging configurations of our products during the quarter ended January 31, 2018, as compared with the prior period.\nSix Months: Summary of Results of Operations\nRevenues for the six-months ended January 31, 2018 decreased 11% to $875,000 compared with prior year six-month revenues of $978,000. Core food safety revenues for the six months ended 2018 decreased 25% as compared with food safety revenues in the six months ended 2017. The decline in both total and food safety revenues was due to timing of product orders, as the initial system-wide stocking order from Chipotle occurred in fiscal 2017 Q1. Net loss for the six months ended January 31, 2018, was $4.4 million compared with $2.7 million for the six month period in 2017. Net loss, excluding derivative income, inducement expense and share-based compensation, for the six months ended January 31, 2018 was $2.6 million, as compared with $2.5 million for the six month period in 2017. Net loss per share was ($0.07) as compared with ($0.04) for the six months ended fiscal 2018 and 2017. Gross margin was 65% during the first six months of fiscal 2018 as compared with 59% during the same six-month period in fiscal 2017. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the sale of higher margin formulations and packaging configurations of our products during the six months ended January 31, 2018 as compared with the prior period.\nHank R. Lambert , CEO, said that, “Based upon the pending roll-out plans of two of our key customers (one in produce and one in food transportation), we have every reason to expect that future financial results will finally begin to reflect the sales ramp we’ve all been expecting.\n“In Q2 we launched a new vertical, receiving our first orders from two customers in the est. $50 million food transportation market. We look forward to follow on orders in the coming months from both plastic pallets and food transport customers.\nLambert continued, “Also in Q2, we named a second notable outside director to our Board. Today, Elisabeth Hagen, M.D. (former USDA Under Secretary for Food Safety), is actively leveraging her expertise and relationships to further all of our key initiatives.\n“Our mission is to protect people and protect company brands by providing superior, leading edge food safety solutions to prevent foodborne illness. We are building momentum and sales traction in our food safety revenues – and we continue to look forward to calendar 2018 as our breakout year,” concluded Lambert.\n2018 Fiscal Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call\nThe Participant Dial-In Number for the conference call is 1-631-891-4304.
