    "text": "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Vectrus, Inc. (NYSE:VEC) announced fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial results. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $295.8 million, operating income was $10.3 million, and diluted earnings per share were $3.70. For the full year, revenue was $1,114.8 million, operating income was $41.2 million, and diluted earnings per share were $5.31. Cash provided by operating activities for 2017 was $35.4 million.\n\"Over the past year, we have made substantial progress in our business while setting the foundation for future growth and continued execution of our strategy,\" said Chuck Prow, president and chief executive officer of Vectrus. \"We have a lot to be proud of in 2017. Vectrus achieved several milestones during the year, including record quarterly operating margin, backlog, and contract awards. Additionally, our team did a phenomenal job of securing the base by winning all of our scheduled re-competes and significant new work that provides strong visibility into 2018 and beyond.\"\n\"In 2018 and beyond, we will continue to execute our strategy to become a leader in the converged infrastructure market within government services,\" said Prow. \"We will aggressively explore new and adjacent markets, enhanced capabilities, and additional channels to drive growth and increase shareholder value. Specifically, we have established a five-year plan and goal to grow revenue to $2.5 billion and expand EBITDA margins to 7 percent. This is clearly an aggressive goal but we see a path forward to achieve this plan through a combination of both strategic organic and purposeful inorganic growth activities.\"\n\"Our momentum has carried into 2018 as demonstrated by our recent win of a new $108 million U.S. Army contract to provide services for Kuwait Dining Facilities (DFAC 3.0) and the acquisition of SENTEL Corporation,\" Prow explained. \"Regarding SENTEL, our cultures including mission, vision, values, and client-centricity, are closely aligned. We are extremely excited about the new clients, capabilities, and contracts that are now accessible to Vectrus. This acquisition is an excellent fit with our three core strategies and accelerates our progress associated with several strategic imperatives. We are optimistic that all of our hard work in 2017 and current strategic initiatives will result in 2018 revenue growth and margin expansion.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nRevenue $295.8 million Operating income $10.3 million Operating margin 3.5% Diluted earnings per share $3.70; adjusted diluted EPS 1 $0.57\nFourth quarter 2017 revenue of $295.8 million increased $7.6 million or 2.6 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase is due to higher revenue of $20.2 million from U.S. programs, $15.5 million from European programs, and $3.9 million from Afghanistan programs, partially offset by a $32.0 million decrease in Middle East programs. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016 included a $47 million contribution from the Army Pre-Positioned Stocks-5 (APS-5) Kuwait contract, which ended in April 2017.\n\"The exceptionally hard work of our team paid off in the fourth quarter as strength in our underlying business, recent contract wins, and solid execution resulted in year-over-year growth,\" said Matt Klein, chief financial officer of Vectrus.\nOperating income was $10.3 million or 3.5 percent operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $8.6 million or 3.0 percent operating margin in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFourth quarter 2017 diluted earnings per share were $3.70 compared to $0.40 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Excluding the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) legislation, fourth quarter 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share 1 were $0.57.\n\"It's important to note that full-year and fourth quarter 2017 diluted earnings per share were positively impacted by recent tax reform, which resulted in the revaluation of our deferred tax liability at the lower 21% federal rate,\" explained Klein.\nFull-Year 2017 Results\nRevenue $1,114.8 million Operating income $41.2 million Operating margin 3.7 percent Diluted earnings per share $5.31; adjusted diluted EPS 1 $2.17 Cash provided by operating activities $35.4 million\nFull-year 2017 revenue of $1,114.8 million decreased $75.7 million or 6.4 percent compared to 2016. The decrease in revenue was attributable mainly to lower activity in our Middle East programs of $70.0 million, which was driven primarily by a decrease of $121.0 million from our APS-5 Kuwait contract, and our Afghanistan programs of $32.6 million, offset by increases of $16.7 million from our European programs and $10.2 million from our U.S. programs.\nOperating income was $41.2 million or 3.7 percent operating margin for the full-year 2017, compared to $42.8 million or 3.6 percent operating margin in 2016.\n\"Our commitment to improving the overall margin profile of our business was demonstrated in 2017 as our team's performance and company-wide initiatives yielded a year-over-year increase in operating margin,\" said Klein. \"This achievement was particularly notable considering the phase-in of several large, long-term contracts and the investments associated with the implementation of our strategic imperatives.\"\nFull-year 2017 diluted earnings per share were $5.31 compared to $2.16 in 2016. Excluding the impact of the TCJA legislation, full-year 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share 1 were $2.17.\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $35.4 million; a decrease of $1.2 million compared to 2016.\nThe Company ended 2017 with total debt of $79.0 million, which was down $6.0 million from $85.0 million at the end of 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had a total consolidated indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA (total leverage ratio) of 1.64x to 1.00x.\n\"During the fourth quarter we closed on a new and expanded credit facility, which increased the amount of funding available under our revolver to $120 million from $75 million,\" said Klein. \"Our new credit facility improves our financial flexibility for future growth opportunities. In 2018 and 2019, the mandatory payments under our new facility are $4 million and $4.5 million, respectively.\"\nThe Company ended 2017 with total backlog of $2.9 billion and funded backlog of $719 million.\nGuidance\n\"In 2018, we expect annual revenue to be in the range of $1,205 million to $1,275 million with a mid-point of $1,240 million or an increase of 11 percent compared to 2017. We expect full-year operating margin to be in the range of 3.6 percent to 4.0 percent and net income to be in the range of $30.5 million to $36.4 million. We expect to see diluted EPS in the range of $2.70 to $3.22 per share, and cash provided by operating activities from $35 million to $39 million,\" said Klein. \"Our 2018 guidance assumes interest expense of approximately $4.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $4.2 million, non-recurring transaction related expenses of $3.0 million, mandatory debt payments of $4.0 million, a tax rate of 22 percent and weighted average diluted shares outstanding of 11.3 million at December 31, 2018.\"\n2018 guidance details include:\n$ millions, except for operating\nmargin and per share\namounts\n2018 Guidance\n2018 Mid\nRevenue\n$1,205\nto\n$1,275\n$1,240\nOperating Margin\n3.6%\nto\n4.0%\n3.8%\nNet Income\n$30.5\nto\n$36.4\n$33.5\nDiluted EPS 2\n$2.70\nto\n$3.22\n$2.96\nCash Provided by\nOperating Activities\n$35.0\nto\n$39.0\n$37.0\nThe Company notes that of future performance made in this release, including 2018 guidance, are based upon current expectations and are subject to factors that could cause actual results those suggested here, including those factors set forth in the Safe Harbor Statement below.\nInvestor Call\nManagement representatives will conduct an investor briefing and conference call at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, Mar. 1, 2018.\nU.S.-based participants may dial into the conference call at 877-407-0792, while international participants may dial 201-689-8263.

In addition, we consider adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share to be useful to management and investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, and to provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations. This information can assist investors in assessing our financial performance and measures our ability to generate capital for deployment among competing strategic alternatives and initiatives.\nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share, however, are not measures of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) and should not be considered a substitute for net income and diluted earnings per share as determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of these items are provided below.\n\"Adjusted net income\" is defined as net income, adjusted to exclude items that may include, but are not limited to, other income; significant charges or credits that impact current results but are not related to our ongoing operations and unusual and infrequent non-operating items and non-operating tax settlements or adjustments, such as revaluation of our deferred tax liability as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and net settlement of uncertain tax positions.\n\"Adjusted diluted earnings per share\" is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding.\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (Non-GAAP Measure)\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income\n$\n41,567\n$\n4,409\n$\n59,497\n$\n23,655\nRevaluation of deferred tax liability 1\n(35,139)\n—\n(35,139)\n—\nAdjusted net income\n$\n6,428\n$\n4,409\n$\n24,358\n$\n23,655\nGAAP EPS, diluted\n$3.70\n$0.40\n$5.31\n$2.16\nAdjusted EPS, diluted\n$0.57\n$0.40\n$2.17\n$2.16\nWeighted average common shares outstanding, diluted\n11,234\n10,988\n11,209\n10,974\n1 Change in deferred tax liability related to change in federal tax rate under Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\nRevenue by military branch, contract type, and contract relationship for the periods presented below was as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands)\n2017\n2016\nMilitary branch\nRevenue\n% of\nTotal\nRevenue\n% of\nTotal\nArmy\n$\n915,554\n82\n%\n$\n1,004,842\n84\n%\nNavy\n21,896\n2\n%\n20,066\n2\n%\nAir Force\n177,338\n16\n%\n165,611\n14\n%\nTotal Revenue\n$\n1,114,788\n$\n1,190,519\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in thousands)\n2017\n2016\nContract type\nRevenue\n% of\nTotal\nRevenue\n% of\nTotal\nFirm-Fixed-Price\n$\n295,880\n27\n%\n$\n297,677\n25\n%\nCost-Plus and Cost Reimbursable ¹\n818,908\n73\n%\n892,842\n75\n%\nTotal Revenue\n$\n1,114,788\n$\n1,190,519\n¹ Includes time and material contracts\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In thousands)\n2017\n2016\nContract Relationship\nRevenue\n% of\nTotal\nRevenue\n% of\nTotal\nPrime Contractor\n$\n1,083,485\n97\n%\n$\n1,131,773\n95\n%\nSub Contractor\n31,303\n3\n%\n58,746\n5\n%\nTotal Revenue\n$\n1,114,788\n$\n1,190,519\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vectrus-announces-strong-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-issues-2018-guidance-and-five-year-growth-plan-300607001.html\nSOURCE Vectrus, Inc.",
