    "text": "March 15, 2018 / 3:30 PM / Updated 15 minutes ago Ex-Deutsche Bank trader Bittar pleads guilty over Euribor rigging Kirstin Ridley 2 Min Read LONDON (Reuters) - Christian Bittar, a former star Deutsche Bank trader, has pleaded guilty to conspiring to manipulate Euribor benchmark interest rates, Britain’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said. FILE PHOTO - Banker, Christian Bittar leaves Westminster MagistratesMagistrates court in London, Britain, January 11, 2016. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls Bittar’s plea had been subject to reporting restrictions but these were lifted on Thursday, around three weeks before the French trader was due to stand trial alongside five co-defendants at London’s Southwark Crown Court on April 9. Bittar and his lawyers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It will be the fifth time the SFO prosecutes former traders on charges relating to benchmark rate manipulation. Five men have been jailed and eight acquitted to date in a five-year criminal investigation that underscores the complexity of bringing white collar crime cases. Euribor, the euro interbank offered rate, is the Brussels-based equivalent of London-based Libor. Four other men and one woman have pleaded not guilty to one count of conspiracy to defraud by manipulating Euribor between 2005 and 2009. Bittar left Deutsche Bank in 2011. The bank declined to comment. It was fined $2.5 billion by U.S. and British authorities in 2015 as part of a global investigation into alleged benchmark interest rate rigging.
