    "text": "DENVER, March 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Jagged Peak Energy Inc. (NYSE: JAG) (\"Jagged Peak\" or the \"Company\") today announced financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017 and its 2018 capital budget as well as associated production and cost guidance. The financial and operating results discussed in this news release include the results for Jagged Peak Energy LLC (the \"Predecessor\") which became a wholly owned subsidiary of Jagged Peak Energy Inc. as the result of transactions associated with the Company's initial public offering (\"IPO\") in January 2017.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Highlights\nProduction volumes were 24,037 Boe/d (80% oil) for the fourth quarter, an increase of 273% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and an increase of 25% compared to the third quarter of 2017. For the full year, Jagged Peak produced 16,974 Boe/d (80% oil), an increase of over 200% compared to 2016 production. Total proved oil and gas reserves as of December 31, 2017 were 82.4 MMBoe (79% oil), an increase of 118% compared to proved reserves at the end of 2016. This increase in reserves resulted in a reserve replacement ratio of over 800% in 2017. Net income for the fourth quarter was $12.8 million, or $0.06 per diluted common share. Eliminating certain non-cash and non-recurring items such as equity-based compensation and income tax expense directly related to the IPO, non-cash mark-to-market gains or losses on derivatives, impairment expense and a one-time gain related to the recent federal tax reform legislation, adjusted net income (a non-GAAP measure) (1) was $20.2 million, or $0.09 per diluted common share. Full year net loss was $451.9 million, or $(0.36) per common share. Adjusted net income for the full year was $55.9 million, or $0.26 per diluted common share. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDAX (a non-GAAP measure) (1) was $78.3 million, with an adjusted EBITDAX margin (a non-GAAP measure) (1) of $35.43 per Boe. Full year adjusted EBITDAX was $203.3 million, representing an adjusted EBITDAX margin (a non-GAAP measure) (1) of $32.81 per Boe. Capital expenditures for drilling and completion activities in the fourth quarter were $168.5 million. For the full year, the Company spent $567.6 million on drilling and completion activities. Capital expenditures for infrastructure totaled $8.1 million during the quarter and $29.9 million for the full year. Additionally, $69.1 million was spent throughout 2017 to add approximately 9,200 net acres to the Company's leasehold position. The Company spud 14 gross operated horizontal wells and completed and brought online 14 gross operated horizontal wells during the fourth quarter 2017. The Company spud 54 gross operated horizontal wells and completed and brought online 46 gross operated horizontal wells during 2017. As of December 31, 2017, total leasehold position was approximately 75,200 net acres, with approximately 2,090 future well locations identified across the Company's leasehold.\n2018 Capital Budget and Guidance Highlights\nJagged Peak's 2018 activity level seeks to balance the optimal long-term development of its assets while continuing to grow production and cash flow and maintaining a strong balance sheet. The Company will manage its 2018 activity in coordination with acquiring and interpreting 3D seismic and other technical data across its acreage position. This data should allow wells to be drilled with a greater percent of lateral in zone, leading to more efficient use of capital through likely improved well performance. The Company expects to spud 40 to 45 gross operated wells and complete and bring online 42 to 46 gross operated wells. The drilling and completion capital expenditure program will range between $540 million to $590 million. Additionally, $20 million to $25 million has been budgeted for water sourcing and disposal infrastructure that will support Jagged Peak's development program and top-tier operating margin. Total net production in 2018 is forecast to average 28,000 to 31,000 Boe/d, representing growth of more than 70% at the mid-point compared to 2017 production. Net oil production will represent 77% to 81% of total net production. First quarter 2018 production is expected to range from 27,000 to 27,300 Boe/d, an increase of more than 10% at the mid-point compared to fourth quarter 2017 production.\nCommenting on 2017 results, Joe Jaggers, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Jagged Peak said, \"2017 was a transformative year for Jagged Peak. We completed our IPO and, through the use of these proceeds, more than quadrupled our activity level based on the number of wells we brought online and more than tripled our total production. We accomplished all of this while maintaining a peer leading adjusted EBITDAX margin and LOE rate, replacing more than 800% of the reserves that we produced and increasing our drilling inventory by over 55% to approximately 2,090 future locations. I am very proud of the Jagged Peak team for the accomplishments from their hard work in 2017. During the fourth quarter, we managed our activity level to make certain operating improvements and to ensure efficient capital investments, which deferred our production growth profile. Following those operational improvements, we are currently deploying five rigs and four completion fleets. As I look towards the future, I know that our incoming President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Kleckner, will do an outstanding job of taking Jagged Peak to the next level in terms of operating performance and capital efficiency.\"\nRegarding Jagged Peak's 2018 plan, Jim Kleckner, incoming President and Chief Executive Officer commented, \"Joe and the Jagged Peak team have done a fantastic job of putting together a world-class asset. Our focus on capital discipline is paramount at Jagged Peak and was instrumental in the 2018 planning process. Our activity level in 2018 will provide the organization with the necessary time to complete the acquisition and interpretation of 3D seismic and other technical data. By completing the interpretation of this data, we will more efficiently deploy capital across our portfolio. In 2018, we expect to spud 40 to 45 gross operated wells and bring 42 to 46 gross operated wells online. We forecast this capital program to increase production by more than 70% over 2017 production. The majority of our activity will be focused in the lower Wolfcamp A formation in Cochise and Whiskey River as our data collection and analysis efforts are further along in these project areas. We forecast this activity level to result in production of 28,000 to 31,000 Boe/d. We are planning for a $50 oil price environment combined with assumed cost inflation of 10% to 15% over 2017. We are confident that this activity level properly balances the long-term development of our assets with a focus on generating attractive corporate-level returns, while maintaining a strong balance sheet with a conservative leverage profile.\"\nOperating Update\nThe Company spud 14 gross operated horizontal wells and completed 14 gross operated horizontal wells during the fourth quarter. From the beginning of the year through March 21, the Company has brought online 11 gross operated horizontal wells and is in the process of completing six additional gross operated horizontal wells.\nThe Company has licensed state-of-the-art, high-quality 3D seismic covering the Cochise project area. Initial results have successfully identified high quality shale targets and assisted in geosteering laterals. The Company is participating in a 3D seismic survey over its Whiskey River project area. The acquisition phase was completed during March 2018 and interpreted data is anticipated to be completed by mid-year. Further, seismic permitting work is nearing completion in the Big Tex project area with data acquisition planned to commence in the second quarter of 2018. The Company continues to add to its understanding of the reservoir system by collecting additional core, reservoir fluid data and pressure data in order to validate the petrophysical model. Together, these efforts are leading to an integrated understanding of optimal reservoir development that will lead to more efficient use of capital.\nAdditionally, the Company's fourth quarter 2017 lease operating expense (\"LOE\") of $3.25 per Boe and full year LOE of $2.88 per Boe remain peer leading. This top-tier LOE rate is driven by the Company's water infrastructure, which provides for cost-efficient water transportation and disposal.\nNotable recent individual well and downspacing test results include the following:\nThe State Whiskey River 4A-8 1H, a lower Wolfcamp A well on the eastern side of the Whiskey River project area, is proving the exceptional rock qualities on the eastern side of the Company's acreage position. This well achieved an IP24 of 226 Boe/d / 1,000' and an IP30 of 203 Boe/d / 1,000'. The well is still producing over 1,400 Boe/d after 100 days online. The Company is currently producing from a 3-well downspacing test in its Cochise project area. The 3-well pad is a test of 660' horizontal spacing within the same lower Wolfcamp A landing zone. These wells began production in late November and have produced a combined 288,850 Boe over their first 115 days online, which is above the Company's Wolfcamp A type curve. The Company has drilled two wells on 660' spacing targeting the 3 rd Bone Spring in the Whiskey River project area. These wells, the Whiskey River 7374A-34 1H and 7374B-34 1H, are showing strong performance over their first three months online. The 7374A-34 1H well achieved an IP24 of 340 Boe/d / 1,000' and an IP30 of 259 Boe/d / 1,000'. The 7374B-34 1H produced an IP24 of 326 Boe/d / 1,000' and an IP30 of 265 Boe/d / 1,000'. These wells have a produced a combined 246,062 Boe over their first 80 days online.\nFinancial Results\nFor the fourth quarter 2017, the Company reported net income of $12.8 million. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $2.0 million. Adjusted EBITDAX (a non-GAAP measure) for the fourth quarter 2017 was $78.3 million, an increase of $62.3 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 and $21.8 million from the third quarter 2017.

Concurrently with the borrowing base redetermination, the pricing structure of the Company's credit facility was reduced by 50 basis points to reflect favorable, current market rates. Permitted hedging levels under the Company's credit facility were increased, providing the Company with the option to hedge a greater percentage of its forecasted production. The Company had an outstanding balance on its credit facility of $155 million as of December 31, 2017. As of March 21, 2018, the Company had $265 million of outstanding borrowings against its credit facility, leaving $275 million of undrawn capacity.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures for drilling and completion activities were $168.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, which represents capital spent to drill and complete 14 gross (13.4 net) wells.

Although Jagged Peak may from time to time voluntarily update its prior forward-looking statements, it disclaims any commitment to do so except as required by applicable securities laws.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDAX\nAdjusted EBITDAX is a non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. We define Adjusted EBITDAX as net income (loss) before interest expense, net of capitalized interest, depletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion expense, impairment of oil and natural gas properties, exploration expenses, equity-based compensation expense, income taxes and net gains or losses on derivatives less net cash from derivative settlements. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historical costs of depreciable assets and exploration expenses, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDAX. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDAX may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nManagement believes Adjusted EBITDAX is useful because it allows investors to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDAX because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance.\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjusted net income is a performance measure used by management to evaluate financial performance, prior to non-cash gains or losses on derivatives, impairment expense, exploratory dry hole costs, gain or loss on the sale of property, certain one-time items, such as equity-based compensation and income tax expense related to the IPO and a one-time gain related to the recent federal tax reform legislation, and the associated changes in estimated income tax. Management believes adjusted net income is useful because it may enhance investors' ability to assess historical and future financial performance. Adjusted net income should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating income, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP or as an indicator of our operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDAX Margin\nAdjusted EBITDAX margin is a performance measure used by management to evaluate financial performance and profitability. The Company defines adjusted EBITDAX margin as the relevant period's adjusted EBITDAX divided by the total oil equivalent production for that same period.\nAbout Jagged Peak Energy Inc\nJagged Peak Energy Inc is an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition and development of unconventional oil and associated liquids-rich natural gas reserves in the southern Delaware Basin, a sub-basin of the Permian Basin of West Texas.\nJagged Peak Energy Inc.\nSelected Operating Highlights\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nProduction Data:\nOil (MBbls)\n1,771\n492\n4,979\n1,702\nNatural gas (MMcf)\n1,377\n283\n3,601\n953\nNGLs (MBbls)\n211\n53\n617\n194\nCombined volumes (MBoe)\n2,211\n592\n6,196\n2,054\nDaily combined volumes (Boe/d)\n24,037\n6,438\n16,974\n5,613\nAverage Sales Prices (before the effects of realized hedges):\nOil (per Bbl)\n$\n53.10\n$\n46.47\n$\n48.56\n$\n41.18\nNatural gas (per Mcf)\n2.45\n2.69\n2.52\n2.32\nNGLs (per Bbl)\n30.96\n19.68\n25.25\n15.81\nCombined (per Boe)\n47.00\n41.65\n43.00\n36.68\nAverage Sales Prices (after the effects of realized hedges):\nOil (per Bbl)\n$\n49.54\n$\n44.17\n$\n48.04\n$\n39.84\nNatural gas (per Mcf)\n2.45\n2.69\n2.52\n2.32\nNGLs (per Bbl)\n30.96\n19.68\n25.25\n15.81\nCombined (per Boe)\n44.15\n39.74\n42.58\n35.57\nAverage Operating Costs (per Boe):\nLease operating expenses\n$\n3.25\n$\n3.80\n$\n2.88\n$\n3.65\nGathering and transportation expenses\n0.91\n0.65\n0.71\n0.51\nProduction and ad valorem tax expenses\n2.35\n1.98\n2.60\n2.12\nDepletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion\n19.82\n18.55\n17.92\n19.67\nGeneral and administrative expense (before equity-based compensation expense)\n2.36\n6.44\n3.73\n5.69\nJagged Peak Energy Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets\n(Unaudited)\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\n(in thousands)\nAssets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n9,523\n$\n11,727\nOther current assets\n51,540\n13,739\nProperty and equipment, net\n1,038,947\n476,593\nOther noncurrent assets\n3,418\n16,333\nTotal assets\n$\n1,103,428\n$\n518,392\nLiabilities and Stockholders' / Members' Equity:\nCurrent liabilities\n$\n174,475\n$\n56,421\nLong-term debt\n155,000\n132,000\nDeferred income taxes\n57,943\n—\nOther long-term liabilities\n16,665\n3,859\nStockholders' / Members' equity\n699,345\n326,112\nTotal liabilities and stockholders' / members' equity\n$\n1,103,428\n$\n518,392\nJagged Peak Energy Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated and Combined Statements of Operations\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nRevenues\nOil, natural gas and NGL sales\n$\n103,948\n$\n24,671\n$\n266,424\n$\n75,359\nOther operating revenues\n474\n206\n888\n1,163\nTotal revenues\n104,422\n24,877\n267,312\n76,522\nOperating Expenses\nLease operating expenses\n7,190\n2,251\n17,874\n7,505\nGathering and transportation expenses\n2,020\n384\n4,424\n1,046\nProduction and ad valorem taxes\n5,204\n1,172\n16,120\n4,345\nExploration\n17\n10\n31\n2,484\nDepletion, depreciation, amortization and accretion\n43,825\n10,987\n111,049\n40,417\nImpairment of unproved oil and natural gas properties\n8\n55\n373\n372\nOther operating expenses\n24\n82\n247\n649\nGeneral and administrative (before equity-based compensation)\n5,229\n3,812\n23,091\n11,690\nGeneral and administrative, equity-based compensation\n11,334\n—\n442,976\n—\nTotal operating expenses\n74,851\n18,753\n616,185\n68,508\nIncome (Loss) from Operations\n29,571\n6,124\n(348,873)\n8,014\nOther Income and Expense\nGain (loss) on commodity derivatives\n(58,537)\n(6,937)\n(42,615)\n(15,145)\nInterest expense and other\n(1,367)\n(1,158)\n(2,503)\n(2,629)\nTotal other income (loss)\n(59,904)\n(8,095)\n(45,118)\n(17,774)\nIncome (Loss) before Income Taxes\n(30,333)\n(1,971)\n(393,991)\n(9,760)\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n(43,096)\n—\n57,943\n—\nNet Income (Loss)\n$\n12,763\n$\n(1,971)\n$\n(451,934)\n$\n(9,760)\nNet Income (Loss) attributable to Jagged Peak Energy LLC (predecessor)\n$\n—\n$\n(1,971)\n$\n(375,476)\n$\n(9,760)\nNet Income (Loss) attributable to Jagged Peak Energy Inc.
