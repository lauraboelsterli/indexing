    "text": "Connor McDavid scored the game-winning goal in the third round of a shootout as the Edmonton Oilers rallied to beat the visiting New York Islanders 2-1 Thursday night at Rogers Place.\nMcDavid gave Edmonton the win by moving in slowly, faking a shot and moving through the crease. Once his move got Islanders goaltender Christopher Gibson to go down, McDavid simply tucked in the wrist shot for the game-winner.\nMcDavid had an eventful night, getting stopped five times by Gibson before scoring a fluky goal with 1:50 remaining in regulation to tie the game. He also was stopped by Gibson on a penalty shot with two minutes left in overtime on a similar move to his winning tally in the shootout.\nEdmonton’s Ryan Nugent-Hopkins also scored in the shootout and McDavid’s third shootout goal of the season stood up as the game-winner when Cam Talbot stopped John Tavares.\nThomas Hickey scored in regulation for the Islanders and former Oiler Jordan Eberle scored in the opening round of the shootout for New York. The Islanders fell to 0-5-3 in their last eight games since posting consecutive shutouts of the New York Rangers and Carolina Hurricanes on Feb. 16 and Feb. 17.\nTalbot made 30 saves while Gibson stopped 35 shots, including six in overtime.\nGibson made his second start of the season after stopping 47 shots in a 3-2 overtime loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins on Saturday.\nThe Islanders struck first 1:54 into the third when Hickey scored his first goal in 13 games. Following a turnover by Milan Lucic near the right boards, Hickey moved through the left circle, dragged the puck and lifted a backhander into the top of the net.\nHickey’s goal stood until McDavid netted his 31st. McDavid sped through the Islanders zone and behind the net, and his pass intended from Zack Kassian deflected off New York defenseman Brandon Davidson’s stick and over Gibson.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
