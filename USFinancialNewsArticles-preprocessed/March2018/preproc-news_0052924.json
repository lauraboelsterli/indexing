    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Wednesday that Russia was still open to the possibility of a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin despite Washingtonâ€™s expulsion of a slew of Russian diplomats.\nFILE PHOTO: A combination of file photos showing Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Novo-Ogaryovo state residence outside Moscow, Russia, January 15, 2016 and U.S. President Donald Trump posing for a photo in New York City, U.S., May 17, 2016. REUTERS/Ivan Sekretarev/Pool/Lucas Jackson/File Photos Trump earlier this month congratulated Putin on his re-election win and said the two leaders would meet soon.\nHowever, already poor ties between Moscow and Washington have since deteriorated further over the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain and the United States on Monday said it was expelling 60 Russian diplomats.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call on Wednesday that Moscow had received no information from Washington about whether the Trump-Putin meeting was still on the agenda, but remained open to cooperation.\nReporting by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Christian Lowe\n ",
