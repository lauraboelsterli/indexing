    "text": "15 March 2018\nMidatech Pharma PLC\n(\"Midatech\" or the \"Company\")\nMidatech announces changes in Senior Management Team\nMidatech (AIM: MTPH, Nasdaq: MTP), the international specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercialising products in oncology and immunotherapy, today announces that Dr Jim Phillips, CEO, will step down at the end of May 2018 after having served the Company for five years. The Board has appointed Dr Craig Cook MD, MBA (currently Chief Operating Officer and Head of Research & Development) to succeed Dr Phillips as CEO and proposed Board member from 1 June 2018, following a transition period of approximately three months in order to ensure a smooth handover.\nThe Board of Directors is also pleased to announce the promotion of Dr Steve Damment, currently Senior Vice President of Translational Medicine, to the role of Head of Research & Development previously held by Dr Cook.\nDr Cook, who joined Midatech in April 2014, has more than 20 years of international experience in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and high technology sectors including roles across a range of therapeutic areas covering both drug development and medical affairs. He has established and successfully led several healthcare initiatives, and held increasingly senior appointments at Johnson & Johnson, Eli Lilly, Novartis Pharma, and Serono Biotech. He is a qualified physician with a BSc in Pharmacology, a Diploma in Anaesthesiology, and an MBA from London Business School.\nDr Steve Damment is an experienced leader in drug development with a long record of advancing drug candidates through key development milestones to successful product registration, initially at Glaxo-Wellcome and then at Shire as Head of Biosciences. Since joining Midatech in 2015, Steve has been deeply involved in its key development programmes.\nRolf Stahel, Non-Executive Chairman of the Board, said: \"I would like to thank Jim for his contribution over the last five years and wish him every success in his future endeavours. Under his dedicated leadership the Company has transformed since 2013 from an academic entity to a publicly-funded, commercially-focused biotech company with strong prospects. We are also fortunate that in Dr Cook we have an internal candidate who can take over responsibility as CEO, ensuring continuity and a controlled handover. Craig will provide strong leadership, demonstrated expertise, a deep understanding of the business, and a relentless focus on delivery of key value-driving programs to take Midatech into its next phase of growth. We have every confidence that Craig, together with his senior management team, will drive Midatech to a successful future.\"\nDr Jim Phillips, Chief Executive Officer of Midatech Pharma, said: \"After five years building Midatech into a fast-growth, high potential specialty pharmaceutical company, I am delighted that Craig will take over the reins as the Company completes its key clinical programmes and moves to file product registrations over the coming years. I leave the business with a very capable and strong leader with an excellent team to support him.\"\nDr Craig Cook, Chief Executive Officer-designate, said: \"I am excited to build on the very strong foundation and ambitious momentum established by Jim, and to lead Midatech at this crucial time as we take our key research programs into clinical development. The fundamentals of Midatech are strong, with our promising technologies underpinning a compelling pipeline of oncology and immunotherapy assets. We are well positioned and have a clear strategy to deliver transformative therapies for patients with devastating rare oncology diseases.\"\nThis announcement contains inside information for the purposes of Article 7 of Regulation (EU) 596/2014 (MAR).\n- Ends -\nFor more information, please contact:\nMidatech Pharma PLC\nRolf Stahel, Non-Executive Chairman\nJim Phillips, CEO\nNick Robbins-Cherry, CFO\nTel: +44 (0)1235 841575\nwww.midatechpharma.com\nPanmure Gordon (UK) Limited (Nominated Adviser and Broker)\nCorporate Finance\nFreddy Crossley / Ryan McCarthy\nBroking\nTom Salvesen\nTel: +44 (0)20 7886 2500\nConsilium Strategic Communications (Financial PR)\nMary Jane Elliott / Ivar Milligan / Nick Brown\nTel: +44 (0)20 3709 5700\nEmail: midatech@consilium-comms.com\nWestwicke Partners (US Investor Relations)\nChris Brinzey\nTel: +1 339 970 2843\nEmail: chris.brinzey@westwicke.com\nNotes for Editors\nAbout Midatech Pharma PLC\nMidatech is an international specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of a pipeline of medicines for oncology and immunotherapy, and marketing these through its established US commercial operation which includes four cancer care supportive products and two further co-promoted products.
