REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo \nShares in Takeda fell more than 5 percent in early morning trade, sharply underperforming the broader Tokyo market .TOPX , which was slightly higher. \nTakeda said on Wednesday it was “at a preliminary and exploratory stage” of considering a bid that could spark another takeover battle in the deal-hungry pharma industry. Shire’s shares ended 15.7 percent higher, valuing the group at around 32 billion pounds ($45 billion). Reporting by Minami Funakoshi; Editing by Chang-Ran Kim",
