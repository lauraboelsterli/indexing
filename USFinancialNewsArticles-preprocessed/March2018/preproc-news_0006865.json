Security Council Resolution 2401 (2018). This resolution demands an immediate ceasefire in Syria,” Merkel’s spokesman said on Friday. \n“The chancellor and the president are also concerned about Russian President Putin’s latest remarks about arms developments and their negative impact on international arms control efforts,” spokesman Steffen Seibert added in a statement. \nWriting by Paul Carrel; Editing by Michelle Martin\n ",
