    "text": "United Airlines apologized Tuesday after a passenger's dog died after being placed in an overhead bin.\n\"This was a tragic accident that should never have occurred, as pets should never be placed in the overhead bin,\" United spokesman Charlie Hobart said.\nMaggie Gremminger identified herself as a fellow passenger on United flight 1284 from Houston to LaGuardia Monday night and wrote in a Facebook post that she witnessed a flight attendant tell the passenger to place the dog carrier in the overhead bin.\nThe passenger was asked to move the bag because it was sticking out into the aisle, according to a person familiar with the incident.\n\"By the end of the flight, the dog was dead,\" Gremminger wrote. \"The woman, crying in the airplane aisle on the floor.\"\nGremminger, who did not immediately return a request to comment, posted that she heard the dog barking and \"we didn't know it was a barking cry for help.\"\nUnited has reached out to passengers who were on the flight for more information about the incident. \n\"We assume full responsibility for this tragedy and express our deepest condolences to the family and are committed to supporting them,\" said the airline's statement. We are thoroughly investigating what occurred to prevent this from ever happening again.\"\nThe airline is paying for a necropsy of the small dog and is refunding the tickets.",
