Uber Technologies Inc said it had suspended its autonomous vehicle program across the United States and Canada. The NHTSA said in a statement it is “in contact with Uber, Volvo, federal, state and local authorities regarding the incident” and will take appropriate action. The safety board said in a statement on Twitter that it was also sending a team to probe the crash. (Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)",
