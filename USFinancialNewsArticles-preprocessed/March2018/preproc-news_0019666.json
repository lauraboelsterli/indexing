    "text": "DENVER, March 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Vista Gold Corp. (TSX & NYSE American: VGZ) (\"Vista\" or the \"Company\") today announced its audited financial results and highlights for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Management's quarterly conference call to discuss these results is scheduled for 10:30 a.m. MST on March 9, 2018. The Company's full audited financial statements, Management's Discussion and Analysis together with other important disclosures can be found in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Canadian securities regulatory authorities.\nSummary of 2017 Financial Results\nWe reported a net loss of $12.0 million or $0.12 per share for the year ended December 31, 2017. This includes $10.8 million of operating and other expenses, and a $1.2 million mark-to-market loss on our investment in Midas Gold Corp.\nOur working capital at December 31, 2017 totaled approximately $19.0 million, including cash and short-term investments (comprised of government securities) of approximately $16.6 million. The Company currently has no debt.\nFrederick H. Earnest, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"2017 was a productive year for Vista. Ongoing environmental permitting work and extensive testing to improve the process flowsheet culminated in two important milestones for the Mt Todd gold project early this year. On January 22 nd we were notified that our request for authorization of a controlled activity, as required under the Commonwealth Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, had been approved. This means that Vista now has all the major environmental approvals necessary for the development of the Mt Todd gold project. On January 24 th we announced the results of an updated Mt Todd preliminary feasibility study (PFS) which demonstrates a large-scale, economically robust gold project at the current gold price. Given its location, advanced permitting status, low-cost profile, and cash-generating capacity, we believe Mt Todd is an attractive undeveloped gold project.\"\nManagement Conference Call\nA conference call with management to review our financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and to discuss corporate and project activities is scheduled for Friday, March 9, 2018 at 10:30 a.m. MST.\nParticipant Toll Free: 833-297-9917\nInternational: 647-689-4524\nConference ID: 8795093\nThis call will also be web-cast and can be accessed at the following web location:\nhttp://event.on24.com/r.htm?e=1623291&s=1&k=6A857F127BC64BF4803EE0942D4DC217\nThis call will be archived and available at www.vistagold.com after March 9, 2018.
