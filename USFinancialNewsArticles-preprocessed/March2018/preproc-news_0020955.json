    "text": "March 8 (Reuters) - Supermarket chain Kroger Co reported quarterly net sales that beat analystsâ€™ estimates, but issued a disappointing full-year profit forecast, sending its shares down 7 percent in premarket trading.\nSales rose to $31.03 billion from $27.61 billion in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 3.\nAnalysts had expected sales of $30.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nNet earnings attributable to Kroger rose to $854 million, or 96 cents per share, from $506 million, or 53 cents per share, a year earlier. The company said it expects full-year 2018 earnings of $1.95 per share to $2.15 per share, largely below the $2.15 analysts on average were expecting.
