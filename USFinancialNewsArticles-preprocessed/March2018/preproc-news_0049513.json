    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning. The AT&T-Time Warner antitrust trial continues into Wednesday. Tuesday’s proceedings got a little heated as AT&T lawyer Daniel Petrocelli grilled an executive of rival Dish Network, attempting to undermine the government’s witness. Today, John Martin, chief of Time Warner’s Turner unit, is up, following some brief testimony Tuesday. Follow along with the WSJ’s live blog .\nOpen Book Zuck shall go the ball! And by “ball,” I mean Congress, to testify in front of at least one House committee in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica brouhaha, CNN first reported . Exact details have yet to be hammered out, and the Facebook chief hasn’t formally accepted requests for him to appear, people familiar with the matter told WSJ . He won’t be hopping over the pond to speak to British lawmakers, though, having turned down an invite from the U.K. parliamentary committee investigating fake news and offering to send Facebook Chief Product Officer Chris Cox or Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer instead. The chairman of that committee, Damian Collins, is not amused.\n—Status Update—\nThere has been so much Facebook news, bullet points are required again.\nFacebook said Wednesday it’s tweaking its privacy settings to make it easier for users to examine and change some of the data Facebook tracks about them. The social network appears to have rolled out a new, oddly designed, grammatically awkward outdoor campaign ( spotted by Recode’s Peter Kafka ) detailing how spam, clickbait, false news and fake accounts “is not your friends.” Meanwhile, remember the “Portal” home video chat box Facebook reportedly was set to announce at its annual developers’ event in May? Bloomberg reports Facebook has decided that now probably isn’t the right time to trumpet such a device and that it’s delaying the announcement . The National Fair Housing Alliance and three other nonprofit U.S. housing advocacy organizations have filed a lawsuit over alleged discriminatory housing advertisements . Facebook said in a statement that it believes the lawsuit is without merit. Firefox (whose owner Mozilla, you’ll remember, went heavy on the PR about pulling Facebook ads) announced a “ Facebook container extension ” for its browser that’ll make it harder for the social network to track users’ activity on other websites using third-party cookies. Bloomberg Businessweek has a must-read detailing how affiliate hucksters have used Facebook ads to peddle all sorts of dodgy items and scams. Facebook’s bad ads policer, Rob Leathern, said on Twitter that the company is doing everything it can to eradicate bad ads and “in the rare instances” its employees have helped advertisers skirt its policies, it’s fired the employees involved. And finally, when you’ve lost Playboy…Playboy Chief Creative Officer Cooper Hefner announced Tuesday that the magazine was “stepping away from Facebook” because the social network’s “content guidelines and corporate policies continue contradicting our values.” (Apparently, Facebook-owned Instagram is fine .) So Give Me Coffee and TV 2017 marked the first year U.S. TV ad spending had declined since 2009, and that decline is set to continue, according to eMarketer, which estimates it’ll drop 0.5% this year to $69.87 billion. TV’s total share of U.S. ad expenditure is predicted fall to 31.6% from 33.9% in 2017 as audiences continue to cut the cord. Paul Verna, eMarketer principal analyst for video, tells me that TV networks are making up at least some of the shortfall through increased ad monetization on digital platforms. “Over the next few years, ad spending on internet-delivered TV platforms will grow at a faster pace than TV ad spending is declining,” Mr. Verna said. EMarketer estimated Hulu and Roku earned a combined $400 million in net digital ad revenue in 2017. And it also assumes that some of the other major “linear OTT” services—such as Sling TV, DirecTV Now, PlayStation Vue and YouTube TV—also earned “substantial ad revenue,” since they all carry ad loads from linear TV. What’s not clear yet is the total ad spending on those platforms and their revenue splits with TV networks.\nShe’s Cheer Captain and I’m on the Bleachers Not to be left out of the direct-to-consumer parade, Turner Sports announced Tuesday a new live sports mobile streaming service of its own. Bleacher Report Live will launch in April and offer access to thousands of live sports events, including UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League soccer, plus NBA League Pass Games and the PGA Championship, Variety reports. There will be “flexible pricing options,” to access games on a per-event or a subscription basis, but an actual price has yet to be announced. For the first couple of months, access will be free as Turner looks to build an audience for the offering, so load up while you can! Bleacher Report Live General Manager Hania Poole told Adweek the service will be ad-supported , saying, “We will take advantage of the natural breaks in the sporting event.” Also launching April is ESPN’s $4.99-a-month new sports-streaming product ESPN+. In an interview with Variety, recently appointed ESPN President Jimmy Pitaro said the primary focus of its new direct-to-consumer service is “making ESPN more relevant to more people across the world.”\nIt’s Always Been a Matter of Trust NBCUniversal’s Facebook bashing has become a well-rehearsed routine in recent months. CMO Today’s Alex Bruell was at NBCU’s annual innovation day Tuesday, where CEO Steve Burke said “Facebook has a real problem” because its recent troubles have rattled trust with its users, advertisers and investors. That‘s “exacerbated” by Facebook’s business model, which Mr. Burke described as being based on data people don’t always know they’re giving and “selling that data, very often electronically” to a buyer Facebook doesn’t always know the identify of. TV’s business model is different and better, he said, because “TV has had regulation; we don’t take cigarette ads.” (FWIW, Facebook’s ad policies don’t allow for tobacco ads either , and I’m sure the social network would take issue with the notion of “selling” that data to ad buyers.) NBCU favors Snap over Facebook because Snap values “professionally produced content,” Mr. Burke said. There’s also the not-so-small matter of the $500 million NBCU invested in Snap as part of its IPO.\nBest of the rest Cambridge Analytica’s former clients say the company’s CEO, Alexander Nix, promised more than he delivered.
