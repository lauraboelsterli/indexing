    "text": "CHATTANOOGA, Tenn., March 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Miller Industries, Inc. (NYSE: MLR) (the \"Company\") today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, net sales were $159.7 million, an increase of 7.5%, compared to $148.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $9.3 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, an increase of 108.8%, compared to net income of $4.5 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, in the prior year period.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $18.5 million, or 11.6% of net sales, compared to $15.2 million, or 10.2% of net sales, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $8.9 million, or 5.6% of net sales, compared to $7.5 million, or 5.0% of net sales, in the prior year period.\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2017, net sales were $615.1 million, an increase of 2.3% compared to $601.1 million in the prior year period. The Company reported net income of $23.0 million, or $2.02 per diluted share for the full year of 2017, an increase of 15.5% compared to net income of $19.9 million, or $1.75 per diluted share for the full year of 2016.\nThe year over year and fourth quarter increase in net income is primarily due to tax benefits related to the re-measurement of deferred taxes under the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 and the release of unrecognized tax benefits, both of which are reflected in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe Company also announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share, payable March 26, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 19, 2018.\nJeffrey I. Badgley, Co-Chief Executive Officer of the Company stated, \"The fourth quarter represents a strong end to fiscal year 2017, with top-line growth of 7%, gross profit growth in excess of 20%, and income before income taxes growth of 25% as compared to the prior year quarter.\"\n\"Our 2017 results benefited significantly from changes in income tax provisions, despite offsetting effects related to increased employee benefit costs related to health care coverage. With the completion of more capital projects, operations have begun to integrate these improvements and we expect both enhanced production efficiencies and additional capacity as we position ourselves to meet heightened customer demand. To help finance these projects, our company had $10.6 million in borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2017.\"\n\"As we look into 2018, we believe that the investments in our facilities will support our strong backlog. We are positioned to move forward with confidence as we meet the increased demand for our products. However, we did experience some cost pressures during the fourth quarter related to higher employee benefits and raw materials. We will continue to monitor these costs closely. In addition, we are monitoring current discussions related to tariffs on steel and aluminum in order to determine the impact they may have on our raw material costs in the future.\"\nIn conjunction with this release, the Company will host a conference call, which will be simultaneously broadcast live over the Internet. Management will host the call, which is scheduled for tomorrow, March 8, 2018, at 10:00 AM ET. Listeners can access the conference call live and archived over the Internet through a link at:\nhttps://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/1034/24945\nPlease allow 15 minutes prior to the call to visit the site, download, and install any necessary audio software.
