    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May’s government will introduce new counter-terrorism legislation to parliament in the coming weeks and months, Security Minister Ben Wallace said on Wednesday.\n“You will see them very soon, we have put together quite a strong package,” Wallace told the BBC. “In the near future, in the next few weeks or months is when you’ll see it.”\nHome Secretary Amber Rudd said last year that counter-terrorism laws need to be updated to keep pace with modern online behavior and to address the issue of online radicalization.\nReporting by Guy Faulconbridge; editing by Kate Holton\n ",
