    "text": "Source: Lyft Brian Roberts, CFO of Lyft. \nRide hailing company Lyft says it booked over $1 billion in GAAP revenue for 2018, and showed revenue growth of 168% in Q4 versus the prior year's quarter. \nThat growth is nearly 3 times as fast as Uber, which saw a 61% increase in revenue in Q4 vs a year ago. It's also claiming 10 million rides per week. \nBut it's still way behind Uber in terms of overall revenue. Uber told The Information that it booked $2.2 billion in net revenue (bookings minus payouts to drivers) in Q4 alone. \nLyft did not disclose how much it lost during the year, but CFO Brian Roberts saying in a statement, \"We've recently achieved record market share levels nationwide even as we significantly reduce sales and marketing expenses.\" ",
