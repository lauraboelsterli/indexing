    "text": "BEIJING, March 1 (Reuters) - Shanghai copper prices fell for a fourth day on Thursday to touch their lowest level in more than two weeks, pushed down as the dollar strengthened and global stock markets declined. A stronger greenback makes metals more expensive for holders of other currencies, weighing on prices. FUNDAMENTALS * SHFE COPPER: The most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange had slipped 0.7 percent to 52,380 yuan ($8,268.09) a tonne by 0150 GMT. The metal earlier touched 52,120 yuan a tonne, its lowest since Feb. 13, before surprisingly positive China data helped pare losses. It is down 2.2 percent so far this week. * CHINA: Growth in China's manufacturing sector unexpectedly picked up to a six-month high in February as factories rushed to replenish inventories to meet rising new orders, a private survey showed on Thursday. * LME COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange edged up 0.2 percent to $6,947.50 a tonne, having fallen by 1.3 percent in both the two previous sessions. It earlier touched $6,905, also its lowest since Feb. 13. * MONGOLIA: The Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine in Mongolia's southern Gobi Desert will lift force majeure effective March 1 and majority owner Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd said on Wednesday that it expected to make up any sales-related effects over the next few quarters. * VALE: Brazil's Vale, the world's no. 1 nickel producer, plans to save well over $150 million by reducing costs across its nickel operations, which have notched positive cash flow for the past two months, company executives said. * SOUTH AFRICA: South Africa's new mining minister Gwede Mantashe said on Wednesday he would finalise the latest version of an industry charter which lays out requirements for black ownership levels and other targets in the next three months.
