    "text": "BERLIN, March 9 (Reuters) - German Social Democrat Olaf Scholz, until now Hamburg Mayor, will become Finance Minister and Heiko Maas, until now Justice Minister, will become Foreign Minister in a new coalition government, the SPD’s designated leader Andrea Nahles said on Friday.\nScholz will also be vice chancellor, Nahles said.\nThe SPD announced on Sunday that two-thirds of its members had voted in favour of a re-run of the ‘grand coalition’ with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives that has governed Germany since 2013, clearing the way for that government to take power later this month.\nReporting by Michelle Martin Editing by Joseph Nasr\n ",
