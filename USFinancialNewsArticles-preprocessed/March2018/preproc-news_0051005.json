    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Wedbush Securities Inc for failing to supervise an employee after the broker-dealer ignored red flags that the employee was involved in a “long-running pump-and-dump scheme targeting retail investors,” the agency said in a statement on Tuesday.\nIt said Wedbush ignored multiple signs of employee Timary Delorme’s fraud, including a customer email detailing her involvement in the scheme. An administrative law judge will hear the case.\nA separate order found Delorme violated anti-fraud provisions of federal securities laws, requiring her to pay a $50,000 penalty and imposing restrictions, the statement added.\nReporting by Mohammad Zargham; Editing by Eric Beech\n ",
