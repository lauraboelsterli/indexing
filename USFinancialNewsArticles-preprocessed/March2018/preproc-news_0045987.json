    "text": "March 27, 2018 / 6:50 AM / in 11 minutes A.G. Barr posts rise in full-year profit, but points to Brexit uncertainty Reuters Staff 1 Min Read (Reuters) - Fizzy drinks maker A.G. Barr Plc ( BAG.L ) posted an 8 percent increase in full-year revenue, “well ahead” of the total market performance, but pointed to economic volatility and uncertainty from Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. The maker of popular Scottish soft drink Irn-Bru said revenue rose to 277.7 million pounds in 2017, from 257.1 million pounds a year earlier. Pretax profit climbed 4.2 percent to 44.9 million pounds. “The UK economic landscape is expected to remain uncertain for business as a whole, with regulation, changing customer dynamics and consumer preferences adding further volatility for the soft drinks industry,” CEO Roger White said.
