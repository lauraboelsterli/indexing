We finished the year with fourth quarter topline sales growth of 9.8% which was in-line with our expectations while our bottom line results were impacted by an elevated promotional backdrop and a tax-reform driven investment in our associates.”\nMr. Barker added, “Looking ahead, our 2018 priorities are focused on our omni-channel strategy encompassing both store growth and e-commerce platform enhancements, customer acquisition and engagement, and merchandising.

The conference call will be webcast and may be accessed via the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at www.sportsmanswarehouse.com .\nNon-GAAP Information\nThis press release includes the following financial measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”): adjusted income from operations, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA. We defined adjusted income from operations and adjusted net income as income from operations and net income, respectively, in each case, plus professional and other fees incurred in connection with the evaluation of a strategic acquisition, secondary offering expenses, an asset write-off, impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and prior year tax credits, as applicable. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is diluted earnings per share excluding the impact of professional and other fees incurred in connection with the evaluation of a strategic acquisition, secondary offering expenses and prior year tax credits. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, pre-opening expenses, secondary offering expenses, professional fees, as asset write-off, impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and other gains, losses and expenses that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing expenses. The Company has reconciled these non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures under “GAAP and Non-GAAP Measures” in this release. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures not only provide its management with comparable financial data for internal financial analysis but also provide meaningful supplemental information to investors. Specifically, these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better understand the performance of the Company’s business and facilitate a more meaningful comparison of its diluted income per share and actual results on a period-over-period basis. The Company has provided this information as a means to evaluate the results of its ongoing operations. Other companies in the Company’s industry may calculate these items differently than the Company does. Each of these measures is not a measure of performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company’s results as reported under GAAP.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private 1995 as contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements in this release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our competitive position and our outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2018. Investors can identify these statements by the fact that they use words such as \"continue\", \"expect\", \"may\", “opportunity”, \"plan\", \"future\", “ahead” and similar terms and phrases. The Company cannot assure investors that future developments affecting the Company will be those that it has anticipated. Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to risks relating to the Company’s retail-based business model, general economic conditions and consumer spending, the Company’s concentration of stores in the Western United States, competition in the outdoor activities and sporting goods market, changes in consumer demands, the Company’s expansion into new markets and planned growth, current and future government regulations, risks related to the Company’s continued retention of its key management, the Company’s distribution center, quality or safety concerns about the Company’s merchandise, events that may affect the Company’s vendors, trade restrictions, and other factors that are set forth in the Company's filings with the SEC, including under the caption “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2017 which was filed with the SEC on March 24, 2017 and the Company’s other public filings made with the SEC and available at www.sec.gov .
