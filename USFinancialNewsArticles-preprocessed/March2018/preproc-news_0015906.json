User engagement and loyalty continued to increase as we diversify the customized content in each category and enhance personalized recommendations. Newly deployed technology such as Virtual/Augmented Reality is also enabling more interaction between our users and automobile OEMs and dealers. In addition, our business model was expanded to include auto-financing service, and data product suites as part of our 2018 strategic expansion, which is code-named 'four ways to eat one fish'. I am very excited about the opportunities that will emerge in 2018 and am confident in our ability to continue delivering a superior experience to our users, collaborate with our automobile partners to further drive their performance, and invest strategically in our ecosystem to continue to be the forefront of innovation in the digital automotive category.\"\nMr. Jun Zou, Chief Financial Officer, added, \"The successful execution of our '4+1' strategy enabled us to finish the year on a strong footing and strengthened our industry-leading position. Combined annual revenues from media and leads generation services increased 33.7% in 2017 while net income grew 63% when compared to last year. We implemented more cost control measures during the quarter which resulted in a further improvement in profitability. Going forward, we will continue to focus on expanding the breadth and depth of the services we have on offer and growing profitability through increased operational efficiency in order to generate sustainable long-term returns for our shareholders.\"\nOverview of Key Financial Results for Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017\nKey Financial Results\n(In RMB Millions except for per share data)\n2016Q4\n2017Q4\n% Change\nFY 2016\nFY 2017\n% Change\nNet Revenues\n2,014.9\n1,751.4\n-13.1%\n5,961.6\n6,210.2\n4.2%\nNet Income attributable to Autohome Inc.\n376.5\n730.4\n94.0%\n1,227.9\n2,001.6\n63.0%\nAdjusted Net Income attributable to Autohome Inc.[2]\n445.7\n775.7\n74.1%\n1,427.9\n2,184.0\n53.0%\nDiluted Earnings Per Share[3]\n3.23\n6.15\n90.4%\n10.58\n16.95\n60.2%\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\n791.9\n1,322.3\n67.0%\n1,625.9\n2,473.0\n52.1%\n[2] Adjusted net income attributable to Autohome Inc. is defined as net income attributable to Autohome Inc. excluding share-based compensation expenses and amortization expenses of intangible assets related to acquisitions.

The increase was mainly due to an increase in average revenue per automaker advertiser as automakers continue to allocate a greater portion of their advertising budgets to Autohome, with increasingly diversified and optimized portfolio of products being offered. Leads generation services revenues increased 29.0% to RMB717.5 million ($110.3 million) from RMB556.4 million in the corresponding period of 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to a 12.0% year-over-year increase in average revenue per paying dealer as dealers continue to allocate a greater portion of their budgets to the Company's services, as well as an expanded dealer client base. Online marketplace revenues were RMB65.4 million ($10.1 million) compared to RMB726.5 million in the corresponding period of 2016. Online marketplace revenues during the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily consisted of revenues from platform-based services offered on Autohome Mall and the Company's auto-financing business. This was the result of implementing the Company's strategy to de-emphasize direct vehicle sales and focus on facilitating transactions.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues decreased 66.4% to RMB322.7 million ($49.6 million) from RMB960.9 million in the corresponding period of 2016, primarily due to a decrease in cost of goods sold related to direct vehicle sales. In addition, cost of revenues included share-based compensation expenses of RMB3.8 million ($0.6 million) during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to RMB3.8 million for the corresponding period of 2016.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased 6.0% to RMB827.3 million ($127.1 million) from RMB780.3 million in the corresponding period of 2016. This increase was mainly due to increases in product development expenses as the Company continues to reinvest in future growth opportunities.\nSales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB506.6 million ($77.9 million) compared to RMB517.6 million in the corresponding period of 2016. Sales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 included share-based compensation expenses of RMB17.0 million ($2.6 million), compared with RMB15.4 million in the corresponding period of 2016. General and administrative expenses decreased 42.7% to RMB54.5 million ($8.4 million) from RMB95.0 million in the corresponding period of 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in share-based compensation expenses and professional service fee. General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 included share-based compensation expenses of RMB8.7 million ($1.3 million), compared with RMB28.9 million in the corresponding period of 2016. Product development expenses increased 58.7% to RMB266.2 million ($40.9 million) from RMB167.7 million in the corresponding period of 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and benefits associated with growth in product development headcount, which is in line with the Company's strategy of strengthening its technology and big data analysis capabilities. Product development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 included share-based compensation expenses of RMB14.7 million ($2.3 million), compared with RMB20.0 million in the corresponding period of 2016.\nOperating Profit\nOperating profit increased 119.8% to RMB601.5 million ($92.5 million) from RMB273.6 million in the corresponding period of 2016, primarily as a result of improved operational efficiency and operating leverage.\nIncome tax benefit\nThere was an income tax benefit of RMB68.9 million ($10.6 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to income tax benefit of RMB71.0 million in the corresponding period of 2016. The income tax benefit was derived from a change in the enacted tax rate of one of Autohome's subsidiaries which resulted in tax benefit of RMB159.0 million ($24.4 million) being recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet Income attributable to Autohome Inc. and EPS\nNet income attributable to Autohome Inc. increased 94.0% to RMB730.4 million ($112.3 million) from RMB376.5 million in the corresponding period of 2016. Basic and diluted earnings per share and per ADS (\"EPS\") were RMB6.24 ($0.96) and RMB6.15 ($0.95), respectively, compared with basic and diluted EPS in the corresponding period of 2016 of RMB3.27 and RMB3.23, respectively.\nAdjusted Net Income attributable to A utohome Inc. and Non-GAAP EPS\nAdjusted net income attributable to Autohome Inc., defined as net income attributable to Autohome Inc. excluding share-based compensation expenses and amortization expenses of intangible assets related to acquisitions, increased 74.1% to RMB775.7 million ($119.2 million) from RMB445.7 million in the corresponding period of 2016. Non-GAAP basic and diluted EPS were RMB6.62 ($1.02) and RMB6.53 ($1.00), respectively, compared with non-GAAP basic and diluted EPS in the corresponding period of 2016 of RMB3.87 and RMB3.82, respectively.\nUnaudited Full Year 2017 Financial Results\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues increased 4.2% to RMB6,210.2 million ($954.5 million) from RMB5,961.6 million in 2016. The increase was mainly due to a 33.7% increase in combined revenues from media and leads generation services, which was partially offset by a decrease in revenues from direct vehicle sales as part of the Company's implementation towards an asset-light strategy.\nMedia services revenues increased 31.3% to RMB3,083.5 million ($473.9 million) from RMB2,347.6 million in 2016. The increase was mainly due to an increase in average revenue per automaker advertiser as automakers continue to allocate a greater portion of their advertising budgets to Autohome, with increasingly diversified and optimized portfolio of products being offered. Leads generation services revenues increased 36.5% to RMB2,616.0 million ($402.1 million) from RMB1,916.4 million in 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to a 21.1% year-over-year increase in average revenue per paying dealer as dealers continue to allocate a greater portion of their budgets to the Company's services, as well as an expanded dealer client base. Online marketplace revenues were RMB510.7 million ($78.5 million) compared to RMB1,697.6 million in 2016. This was the result of implementing the Company's strategy to de-emphasize direct vehicle sales and focus on facilitating transactions.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues decreased 43.2% to RMB1,358.7 million ($208.8 million) from RMB2,393.2 million in 2016, primarily due to a decrease in cost of goods sold related to direct vehicle sales. Cost of revenues included share-based compensation expenses of RMB15.2 million ($2.3 million) compared to RMB12.3 million for the corresponding period of 2016.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased 16.3% to RMB2,808.2 million ($431.6 million) from RMB2,415.1 million in 2016. This increase was mainly due to increases in product development expenses and sales and marketing expenses as the Company continues to reinvest in future growth opportunities.\nSales and marketing expenses increased 7.2% to RMB1,647.5 million ($253.2 million) from RMB1,536.9 million in 2016. This increase was primarily due to (i) an increase in marketing expenses in connection with the promotion of the Company's brand through mobile platforms and offline execution and promotional expenses, and (ii) an increase in salaries and benefits in line with the Company's overall growth. Sales and marketing expenses for full year 2017 included share-based compensation expenses of RMB53.1 million ($8.2 million), compared with RMB50.8 million in 2016. General and administrative expenses in 2017 were RMB282.0 million ($43.3 million) compared to RMB306.8 million in 2016. General and administrative expenses of 2017 included share-based compensation expenses of RMB60.0 million ($9.2 million), compared with RMB78.0 million in 2016. Product development expenses increased 53.8% to RMB878.8 million ($135.1 million) from RMB571.4 million in 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in salaries and benefits as a result of the growth in product development headcount, which is in line with the Company's strategy of strengthening its technology and big data analysis capabilities. Product development expenses of 2017 included share-based compensation expenses of RMB49.6 million ($7.6 million), compared with RMB54.3 million in 2016.\nOperating Profit\nOperating profit increased 77.2% to RMB2,043.3 million ($314.0 million) from RMB1,153.4 million in 2016, primarily as a result of improved operational efficiency and operating leverage.\nIncome tax expense\nIncome tax expense was RMB267.1 million ($41.1 million) in 2017, a significant increase from RMB32.6 million in 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in taxable income and withholding tax liability associated with special cash dividend.\nNet Income attributable to Autohome Inc. and EPS\nNet income attributable to Autohome Inc. increased 63.0% to RMB2,001.6 million ($307.6 million) from RMB1,227.9 million in 2016. Basic and diluted earnings per share and per ADS (\"EPS\") were RMB17.20 ($2.64) and RMB16.95 ($2.61), respectively, compared with basic and diluted EPS in 2016 of RMB10.75 and RMB10.58, respectively.\nAdjusted Net Income attributable to A utohome Inc. and Non-GAAP EPS\nAdjusted net income attributable to Autohome Inc., defined as net income attributable to Autohome Inc. excluding share-based compensation expenses and amortization expenses of intangible assets related to acquisitions, increased 53.0% to RMB2,184.0 million ($335.7 million) from RMB1,427.9 million in 2016. Non-GAAP basic and diluted EPS were RMB18.77 ($2.88) and RMB18.50 ($2.84), respectively, compared with non-GAAP basic and diluted EPS in 2016 of RMB12.50 and RMB12.31, respectively.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of RMB8,154.2 million ($1,253.3 million). Net cash provided by operating activities in the year of 2017 was RMB2,473.0 million ($380.1 million), compared with RMB1,625.9 million in the year of 2016.\nEmployees\nThe Company had 4,097 employees as of December 31, 2017.\nBusiness Outlook\nAutohome currently expects to generate net revenues in the range of RMB1,220 million ($187.5 million) to RMB1,250 million ($192.1 million) in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, representing a 1.1% to 3.6% year-over-year increase. This forecast reflects the Company's current and preliminary view on the market and its operating conditions, which are subject to change.\nStarting on January 1, 2018, Autohome adopted a new revenue recognition accounting standard ASC 606. Under ASC 606, the most significant impact on Autohome will be the change from presentation of tax on gross basis to net basis. The above guidance reflects revenues net of tax under the new revenue recognition standard. If presented on gross basis including value-added tax, the same basis as that for the year 2017, net revenues are expected to be between RMB1,345 million ($206.7 million) to RMB1,375 million ($211.3 million) in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will host an earnings conference call at 7:00 AM U.S. Eastern Time on Wednesday, March 7, 2018 (8:00 PM Beijing Time on the same day).\nDial-in details for the earnings conference call are as follows:\nUnited States:\n1855-824-5644\nHong Kong:\n3027-6500\nChina Domestic:\n8009-880-563\nUnited Kingdom:\n0800-026-1542\nInternational:\n+1 646-722-4977\nPasscode:\n47716761#\nPlease dial in ten minutes before the call is scheduled to begin and provide the passcode to join the call.\nA replay of the conference call may be accessed by phone at the following numbers until March 13, 2018:\nUnited States:\n+1-646-982-0473\nInternational:\n+61-2-8325-2405\nPasscode:\n319285596#\nAdditionally, a live and archived webcast of the conference call will be available at http://ir.autohome.com.cn .\nAbout Autohome Inc.\nAutohome Inc.

We define Adjusted Net Income attributable to Autohome Inc. as net income attributable to Autohome Inc. excluding share-based compensation expenses and amortization expenses of intangible assets related to acquisitions. We define Non-GAAP basic and diluted EPS as Adjusted Net Income attributable to Autohome Inc. divided by the basic and diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Autohome Inc. before income tax expense, depreciation expenses of property and equipment and amortization expenses of intangible assets and interest expense, excluding share-based compensation expenses. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because they are used by our management to evaluate our operating performance, in addition to net income prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are important to help investors understand our operating and financial performance, compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis and assess our core operating results, as they exclude certain expenses that are not expected to result in cash payments. The use of the above non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations. Share-based compensation expenses have been and will continue to be incurred in the future and are not reflected in the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures, but should be considered in the overall evaluation of our results. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \"Reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP Results\" set forth at the end of this press release.\nFor investor and
