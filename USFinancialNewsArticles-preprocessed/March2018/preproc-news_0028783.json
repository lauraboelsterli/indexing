    "text": "Elon Musk is believed to be working on a new comedy project. And there’s a chance he might have just revealed its name.\nMusk on Wednesday published a tweet that said, solely, “Thud!” He followed that with another tweet that said Thud! is “the name of my new intergalactic media empire, exclamation point optional.”\nJokes aside, there could be something to what Musk is referring to in his tweets.\nThat’s the name of my new intergalactic media empire, exclamation point optional\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 14, 2018\nEarlier this week, a Daily Beast report surfaced, saying Musk had hired former editors and reporters from The Onion on a secret project. In statements to The Daily Beast, Musk and those editors, Cole Bolton and Ben Berkeley, hinted at a “brand-new comedy project.” It’s been speculated that Musk also tried to acquire The Onion in 2014, but the deal fell through. He’s now believed to be trying to build an alternative of some sort.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter\nSo, is Thud! the name for Musk, Bolton, and Berkeley’s latest project? Given the tone of his tweet, it’s impossible to say whether it’s a joke or if it’s indeed the name. But it does appear clear that Musk has something focused on comedy and media in his sights and it might find its way to the Web at some point soon.\nAfter all, in his statement to The Daily Beast, Musk called it the next big thing: “It’s pretty obvious that comedy is the next frontier after electric vehicles, space exploration , and brain-computer interfaces.”",
