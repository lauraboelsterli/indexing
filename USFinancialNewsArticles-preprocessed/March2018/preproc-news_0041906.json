On February 1, 2018, OSS stock commenced trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market, followed by the closing of the IPO and partial overallotment exercise for gross proceeds of $19.5 million.\nProduct Highlights\nIntroduced multiple state-of-the-art products, including the highest performance GPU acceleration system, a mil-spec hardened flash array, and multiple video display servers:\nAnnounced a new GPU acceleration system containing eight NVIDIA® V100 SXM2 modules with NVLink GPU-to-GPU interconnects.\nCompleted design and mil-spec testing and began shipping production units for the company’s airborne military flash array program.

The OSS-designed systems can simultaneously drive up to 16 HD or 4K displays in a rugged, high-density format.\n2017 Financial Summary\nRevenue increased 46% to a record $27.5 million from $18.9 million in 2016. The increase was primarily driven by the organic growth in the company’s existing customer base of $5.9 million or 69% of the total increase. The addition of Magma for the full year contributed $2.1 million or 24% to the total, with the acquisition of the Ion business in July 2017 adding $567,000 or 6.6%. SkyScale, launched in April 2017, contributed less than 1% to the total.\nGross margin increased to $8.7 million or 31.5% of revenue, as compared to $5.5 million or 29.2% in 2016. The increase in gross margin was attributable to increased non-recurring engineering for new designs and shift in product mix to higher margin products.\nOperating expenses increased to $9.1 million or 33.1% of revenue as compared to $5.7 million or 30.4% of revenue in 2016. The increase is mainly attributable to a full year of Magma employee costs in 2017 as compared to less than six months in 2016, as well as the addition of the Ion development team and facility in the last six months of 2017.\nNet income increased to $96,620 or $0.01 per diluted share, as compared to a loss of $184,437 or $(0.04) per basic and diluted share in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased to $979,138, up 134% from $418,972 in 2016 (see definition of adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP term, and its reconciliation to GAAP, below).\nUpon completion of the company’s initial public offering, the company received net proceeds of $17.95 million. All outstanding notes payable and the balance due on the company’s bank line of credit were subsequently retired, resulting in the company operating debt-free. The company’s current cash position totals approximately $10 million.\nManagement Commentary\n“We are extremely pleased with our 2017 results and IPO success,” said Steve Cooper, OSS president and CEO. “Given the continued growth from our OEM customers and recent design wins, complemented by our focus on future M&A activities, we are optimistic our rapid growth will continue in 2018.”\n2018 Financial Outlook\nRevenue, exclusive of any future M&A activity, is expected to range between $36 million and $38 million in 2018, representing an increase of 31% to 38% as compared to 2017.\nRevenue growth is not expected to be linear in 2018 due to the timing of shipments related to the company’s military flash array program and other customer demand variances. The company anticipates 60% to 63% of its revenue in 2018 to be generated in the second half of the year. Quarterly revenue may fluctuate plus or minus 15% from the company’s plan in any given quarter due to variations in delivery.\nConference Call\nOSS management will hold a conference call to discuss its 2017 results later today, followed by a question and answer period.\nDate: Wednesday, March 21, 2018\nTime: 5:00 p.m. Eastern time (2:00 p.m. Pacific time)\nToll-free dial-in number: 1-888-394-8218\nInternational dial-in number: 1-323-701-0226\nConference ID: 5829285\nThe conference call will be webcast live and available for replay here as well as via a link in the Investors section of the company’s website at ir.onestopsystems.com .

For more information, go to www.onestopsystems.com .\nAbout the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nOSS management believes the use of adjusted EBITDA can be helpful for an investor in assessing the performance of the company. OSS defines adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss attributable to company before depreciation and amortization, amortization of debt discount, interest expense or income, income tax provision or benefit, stock-based compensation and M&A (merger and acquisition) expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company’s non-cash operating expenses, management believes that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes non-cash and certain other expenses allows for meaningful comparisons between the company’s core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as provides management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating the company’s core business operating results over different periods of time.\nThe company’s use of adjusted EBITDA may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the industry, as other companies in the industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or as an indication of operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. Management does not consider adjusted EBITDA to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to company to adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 Net income (loss) attributable to company $ 96,620 $ (184,437 ) Depreciation and amortization 836,274 437,036 Amortization of debt discount 23,837 10,925 Stock-based compensation 160,062 77,647 Interest expense (income) 199,257 152,877 Income tax provision (benefit) (402,717 ) (182,937 ) M&A expense (1) 65,805 107,681 Adjusted EBITDA $ 979,138 $ 418,792 (1) Expenses incurred in the acquisition of Ion software in 2017 and the merger with Magma in 2016.\nCautionary Note Regarding\nOne Stop Systems cautions you that statements in this press release that are not a description of historical facts are .
