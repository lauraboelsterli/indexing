    "text": "Mike Theiler | Reuters Donald Trump \nPresident Donald Trump on Sunday railed against both the Russia investigation and the two men dispatched from the upper ranks of the FBI, accusing the Special Counsel of partisanship and speculating on \"fake memos\" kept by Andrew McCabe and James Comey. \nIn an early morning tirade on Twitter, Trump accused Robert Mueller — a Republican with a reputation for independence who's held appointed positions under both Democratic and GOP presidents — of hiring \"hardened Democrats\" to probe alleged ties between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION! \nTrump's tweetstorm came in the wake of his personal lawyer, John Dowd, calling for an end to the Russia investigation after the firing of McCabe, who at one point was the acting director of the FBI. He was fired abruptly late Friday by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and the departure has done little to quell the controversy engulfing the bureau. \nMedia reports suggest that McCabe kept a secret file of notes on his discussions with Trump, similar to documents Comey is said to have taken during his tenure. McCabe reportedly has turned over those memos to Mueller as part of his investigation, but on Sunday Trump dismissed the notion of either McCabe or Comey having anything incriminating, calling them \"fake memos.\" Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me. I don't believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos? 'Childish, defamatory and disgusting' \nMichael Bromwich, a former federal prosecutor representing McCabe, lashed out at the president on Twitter, accusing Trump of \"corrupting the entire process\" that led to McCabe's ouster, and calling his accusations \"disgusting.\"",
