Our proprietary, internally-developed pipeline includes multiple potentially first- or best-in-class programs. Our three most advanced clinical programs are: ralinepag (APD811), which we are currently preparing for a Phase 3 program for pulmonary arterial hypertension; etrasimod (APD334), for which we are planning a Phase 3 program for ulcerative colitis and are continuing to study for other immune and inflammatory conditions; and APD371 for visceral pain conditions and which is being studied in a Phase 2 trial for treatment of pain associated with Crohn's disease. In addition, we have collaborations with the following pharmaceutical companies: Everest Medicines Limited (ralinepag and etrasimod in Greater China and select countries in Asia), Axovant Sciences GmbH (nelotanserin - Phase 2), Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH (undisclosed target - preclinical), and Eisai Co., Ltd. and Eisai Inc. (BELVIQ®/BELVIQ XR® - marketed products).\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this press release are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. These statements may be identified by introductory words such as \"may,\" \"expects,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"will,\" \"achieve,\" \"anticipate,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"subject to\" or words of similar meaning, or by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements include statements regarding Arena's expectations with respect to the completion, timing and size of the proposed public offering. For such statements, Arena claims the protection of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual events or results may differ materially from Arena's expectations. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties associated with market conditions and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions related to the proposed offering; and those factors disclosed in Arena's filings with the SEC, including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. These forward-looking statements represent Arena's judgment as of the time of this release. Arena disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements, other than as may be required under applicable law.\nCorporate Contact:\nKevin R.
