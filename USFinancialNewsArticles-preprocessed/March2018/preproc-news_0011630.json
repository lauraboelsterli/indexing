    "text": "DHAKA, March 5 (Reuters) - Bangladesh’s foreign exchange reserves rose to $33.37 billion at the end of February, $680 million more than the previous month, the central bank said on Monday.\nThe reserves were up nearly 2.5 percent from a year earlier, and are sufficient to cover about 10 months’ worth of imports for the country of 160 million people.\nSteady garment exports and remittances from Bangladeshis working overseas - the key drivers of the country’s more-than $250 billion economy - have helped foreign exchange reserves grow steadily in recent years.\nBangladesh’s economic growth hit a record 7.28 percent in the 2016-17 financial year, up from 7.11 percent a year ago.
