    "text": "Groupon is apologizing after a listing on the site included a racial slur.\nTwo listings for women’s boots seemed innocuous until customers looked at the color options available, one being “n brown.” The offensive description was used by more than one of Groupon’s third-party sellers including Kojwa and Margines, though Cosmopolitan reports other stores used the language as well.\n“We are appalled that this language was displayed on our site,” a Groupon spokesperson told Fortune. “ This product description was provided by a third-party seller via our self-service platform. Regardless, this is completely unacceptable and violates our policies — to say nothing of our values.\n“When made aware of the issue, we immediately removed the deal — as well as the third-party seller — from our marketplace. Language like this has no place on Groupon, and we’re further strengthening our self-service controls to ensure it doesn’t happen again.”\nHowever, for some Groupon customers, the damage appears to have been done, as many on social media have said that they will no longer be using Groupon’s services.",
