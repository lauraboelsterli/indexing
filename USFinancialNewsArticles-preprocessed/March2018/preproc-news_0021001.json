Prices of strawberries jumped 23.2 percent, while prices for pumpkin and rice surged 25.5 percent and 21.1 percent respectively.\n“A cold wave throughout February pushed up the prices of fresh vegetables while consumer prices were largely stable. Oil prices are ticking up again and supporting prices of industrial products,” a Statistics Korea official said.\nLocal petroleum prices gained 3.0 percent from a year earlier, Statistics Korea said, raising prices for petrochemical and other industrial goods for local consumers.\nGlobal oil prices are on the rise on expectations for robust oil demand growth and concerns that output from OPEC producers would grow at a much slower pace in coming years.\nMonth-on-month inflation was 0.8 percent, slightly above the poll’s forecast of a 0.5 percent rise.
