    "text": "TOKYO, March 9 (Reuters) - Longer-dated Japanese government bond prices edged lower on Friday, as Tokyo stocks gained on easing tensions over North Korea, curbing investor demand for safe-haven debt.\nU.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to meet with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un improved risk sentiment across the region, with the Nikkei advancing more than 1 percent.\nThe 40-year bond yield rose 1 basis point to 0.890 percent, while the 20-year yield was half a basis point higher at 0.540 percent.\nThe 10-year yield initially nudged up to 0.055 percent, but last stood unchanged at 0.050 percent.\nThe JGB market showed little reaction to the Bank of Japan’s decision to stand pat on monetary policy on Friday, as the outcome was well anticipated.\nBOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda caused a stir a week ago when he said the central bank would eventually consider an exit from its ultra easy monetary policy.\nBut with fears of a global trade war and a strong yen clouding Japan’s economic outlook, Kuroda is likely to use his post-meeting briefing scheduled at 0630 GMT to reassure markets that the BOJ is in no rush to dial back.
