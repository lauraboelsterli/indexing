External demand is strong, so I‘m optimistic that the economy will grow this year.”\nRevised gross domestic product (GDP) for October-December is due on March 8 at 0850 JST (2350 GMT March 7).\nIn preliminary GDP data, capital expenditure rose 0.7 percent, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of gains in a sign of companies’ willingness to invest.\nMany economists remain optimistic that the economy can continue to grow, but recent economic data paints a mixed picture as industrial output fell more than expected in January and the Purchasing Managers Index showed a slight slowdown in corporate activity.
