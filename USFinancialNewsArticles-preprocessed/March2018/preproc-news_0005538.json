    "text": "538 COMMENTS Politics is blood sport, as presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner is learning the hard way. The 80% of Washington that wants Donald Trump out as President is now targeting Mr. Kushner as a means to that end. \nHiring family for high-profile jobs is always high political risk. Proximity to the throne means they may intimidate dissenting views that need to be heard. Their loyalty can be an asset, but they inevitably become high-profile political targets. Above all they are hard to fire even when they become liabilities. Exhibit A is Hillary Clinton, who brought scandals like Travelgate and cattle futures and the debacle of HillaryCare as first lady.\nMr. Kushner is merely an in-law, but he poses some of the same political risks. The latest uproar concerns the loss of his interim “top secret” security clearance on Friday as the FBI continues its clearance investigation. After the fiasco over former White House aide Rob Porter’s clearance, chief of staff John Kelly has put a limit on interim clearances. Mr. Kelly is right not to make an exception for Mr. Kushner, which would have inevitably leaked and looked like family favoritism. This is another example of Mr. Kelly’s value to the President. \nMr. Kushner’s enemies piled on Tuesday with an egregious leak to the Washington Post that foreign countries including China and Mexico have discussed how to exploit Mr. Kushner’s vulnerabilities in negotiations. Imagine that: A foreign country trying to exploit the weaknesses of American counterparts. The leak gave away to the foreign officials who discussed this that the U.S. was spying on them. Let’s hear no more complaints from the media about compromising “sources and methods.”\nHowever outrageous, the leak is proof that the long knives are out for Mr. Kushner, and they’ll keep slashing. Without a top-secret clearance Mr. Kushner will lack crucial information that could be helpful in his role as a mediator between Israel and the Palestinians. He also won’t be able to see the President’s daily intelligence briefing. While Mr. Kushner has other policy portfolios, such as prison reform, his value as a formal White House adviser will be diminished.\nThe larger problem is that—thanks to another leak—we know Mr. Kushner is on special counsel Robert Mueller’s subject list. This includes his personal business dealings. Last year Mr. Kushner offered the House and Senate Intelligence committees an account of what he said were his complete dealings with Russians during the presidential campaign. But only he and his lawyers know if there are other vulnerabilities. If there are, he and President Trump would both better off if Mr. Kushner were out of the White House before they become public.\nGiving up their White House positions would be a bitter remedy, but Mr. Kushner and first daughter Ivanka could still offer advice as outsiders. Every President needs loyal counselors detached from the White House hothouse, and George W. Bush sometimes played that role for George H.W. Bush. There are specific and significant diplomatic roles the two could perform, or projects they could lead, such as Ivanka’s admirable performance at the Olympics. \nMr. Trump’s second year could determine his presidential fate as Mr. Mueller’s probe rolls on and midterm elections give Democrats a chance to take the House and impeach him. Mr. Trump needs the discipline that Mr. Kelly has imposed, and the White House announced Wednesday that communications aide Hope Hicks plans to resign after she became a political target.\nMr. Kushner and Ivanka have to decide if they’d serve themselves and the President better by walking away from their formal White House roles.",
