The information contained on the Nuveen website is not a part of this press release.\nSecurities offered through Nuveen Securities, LLC, member FINRA and SIPC.\nInvesting involves risk; principal loss is possible. There is no guarantee the Fund’s investment objectives will be achieved. This ETF seeks to generally track the investment results of an index; however the Fund may underperform, outperform or be more volatile than the referenced index. This Fund invests in REITs and real estate companies. The real estate industry is greatly affected by economic downturns or by changes in real estate values, rents, property taxes, interest rates, tax treatment, regulations, or the legal structure of the REIT. The value of equity securities may decline significantly over short or extended periods of time. The Fund’s assets will generally be concentrated in the securities of issuers in the real estate sector, and, accordingly, the Fund may be adversely affected by the performance of those securities, may be subject to increased price volatility and may be more susceptible to adverse economic, market, political or regulatory occurrences affecting that industry. These and other risk considerations, such as interest rate, non-diversification, and smaller company risks, are described in detail in the Fund’s prospectus.\nBefore investing, carefully consider fund investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. For this and other information that should be read carefully, please request a prospectus or summary prospectus from your financial advisor or Nuveen at 800-257-8787 or visit www.nuveen.com .\n456180-INV-O-03/20\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180326006093/en/\nNuveen\nKristyna Munoz\n254-644-1615\nkristyna.munoz@nuveen.com\nSource: Nuveen",
