Collectively the consolidated entity now serves almost one million customers in Ontario’s Greater Golden Horseshoe Area.\nKey factors that led to the judges’ unanimous decision to award Alectra with this achievement were the strategic nature of the merger and the complexities management was able to overcome by merging four utility companies together.\n“It is a tremendous honour to have Alectra recognized by the Canadian Dealmakers Program,\" said Max Cananzi, President, Alectra Utilities. “Leading by example in the utility industry is not just something we say, it is a key component of our business that impacts our commitment to being innovative.”\nEach year the Canadian Dealmakers program recognizes Canadian companies or individuals whose consolidation transactions significantly benefits their industry by promoting innovation and growth, establishing M&A best practices, enhancing customer service and creating value that extends beyond a return on investment.\nAbout Alectra’s Family of Companies\nAlectra’s family of energy companies distributes electricity to nearly one million customers in Ontario’s Greater Golden Horseshoe Area and provides innovative energy solutions to these and thousands more across Ontario.
