(OTCQB: SFHD) (\"Hui Ying\" or the \"Company\"), a leading online financial credit facility solution provider servicing Small-to-Medium Enterprises (\"SMEs\") and individual borrowers in China, today announced its financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017*.\n* financial statements for 2016 have been restated.\nFiscal Year 2017 Highlights\nFor the Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n($ millions, except per share data)\n2017\n2016\n% Change\nRevenues\n$ 46.50\n$ 24.68\n88.4%\nLoan origination service Fee\n$ 26.70\n$ 17.49\n52.7%\nLoan repayment management fee\n$ 18.21\n$ 7.19\n153.3%\nFinancing income from entrusted loans\n$ 1.58\n$ -\nNM\nOperating income\n$ 17.95\n$ 4.47\n301.6%\nOther income (expenses)\n$ (0.11)\n$ 0.03\n-466.7%\nNet income\n$ 15.27\n$ 3.44\n343.9%\nEPS - diluted\n$ 0.21\n$ 0.05\n320.0%\nTotal loans facilitated through our platform increased by 59.9% to $1,308.7 million for the year ended 2017 from $818.5 million in 2016, as China's online peer-to-peer lending platform industry continued to grow significantly during 2017, coupled with an increased marketing campaign, promotion activities on our platform as well as increased brand awareness of our online marketplace. This led to accumulated value of loans facilitated through our platform in the aggregate amount of $2.87 billion since the launch of our marketplace in December 2013 through the end of 2017. We had 8,047 borrowers and 69,232 investors participated in an aggregate of 23,263 loans during 2017, compared to 1,067 borrowers, 39,999 investors and 8,739 loans during 2016. As of the end of 2017, we had 367, 893 registered investors and 24 cooperative partners who frequently serve as guarantors of loans on our platform. Total revenues increased by 88.4% to $46.50 million for the year ended 2017 from $24.68 million in 2016, as a result of an increase in loans facilitated through our platform and the contribution from the newly launched entrusted loan business. Revenues from loan origination service fees, loan repayment management fees and financing income from entrusted loans were $26.70 million, $18.21 million and $1.58 million, respectively, for the year ended 2017 compared to $17.49 million, $7.19 million and nil, respectively, in 2016. Net income increased by 344.1% to $15.27 million for the year ended 2017 from $3.44 million in 2016. Diluted earnings per share was $0.21 for the year ended 2017, compared to $0.05 for 2016. Bodang Liu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Hui Ying, commented, \"We are very pleased to report strong 2017 financial results with revenues growing by 88.4% to $46.50 million and net income more than quadrupled to $15.27 million. We have benefitted from continuing growth and momentum in the peer-to-peer lending industry as well as the increasing awareness and reputation of our online marketplace.\"\n\"Looking ahead, despite uncertainties in the regulatory environment and challenges in quickly evolving market conditions and the competitive landscape, we are increasingly confident in our long-term prospects as we remain steadfast and determined to build and promote our online marketplace as a convenient, secure, and effective solution for under-served SMEs and individual borrowers who need access to financing.\"\nFiscal Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenues\nFor the year ended 2017, total revenues increased by $21.82 million, or 88.4%, to $46.50 million from $24.68 million in 2016. The increase of total revenues was mainly attributable to the increase in the volume of loans facilitated through our platform as well as financing income generated through our entrusted loan business we launched in June 2017, which contributed 3.4% of total revenues in 2017. The total loan volume facilitated through our platform increased by $490.2 million or 59.9%, to $1,308.7 million for the year ended 2017 from $818.5 million in 2016.\nThe loan origination service fee increased by $9.21 million, or 52.7%, to $26.70 million for the year ended 2017 from $17.49 million in 2016. The loan repayment management fee increased in 2017 by $11.02 million, or 153.3%, to $18.21 million from $7.19 million in 2016. The financing income from entrusted loans was $1.58 million for 2017, compared to nil for 2016. The loan origination service fee, loan repayment management fee, and financing income from entrusted loans accounted for 57.4%, 39.2% and 3.4%, respectively, of total revenues for the year ended 2017, compared to 70.9%, 29.1% and nil, respectively, for 2016. The change is due to the shift in structuring our loan products towards longer duration loans. Since our loan repayment management fee is based on a certain percentage of the duration of a loan, the more loans with longer terms, the more loan repayment management fees we generate. We expect this trend will continue as the industry becomes more regulated and investors are getting more comfortable investing in loans with longer terms. We will continue to adjust our loan product offerings accordingly.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses increased by $8.34 million, or 41.2%, to $28.55 million for the year ended 2017 from $20.21 million in 2016. Sales and marketing expenses increased by $6.10 million, or 37.7%, to $22.29 million for 2017 from $16.19 million for 2016. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was associated with sales and marketing efforts and promotion activities that led to a higher volume of loans facilitated through our platform. As a percentage of total revenues, sales and marketing expenses were 47.9% for the year ended 2017, compared to 65.6% for 2016. General and administrative expenses increased $2.78 million, or 88.0%, to $5.94 million from $3.16 million in 2016, primarily due to over $1.2 million in professional, consulting and related expenses associated with the Company's uplisting efforts onto Nasdaq. As a percentage of total revenues, general and administrative expenses were 12.8% in 2017, essentially unchanged from 2016.\nOperating Income\nOperating income increased by $13.48 million, or 301.6%, to $17.95 million in 2017 from $4.47 million in 2016. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by an increase in total revenues and partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Operating margin was 38.6% for the year ended 2017, compared to 18.1% in 2016.\nIncome before Income Taxes\nTotal other expense, including interest income, interest expenses and bank charges, realized gain on investments and others, was $0.11 million for the year ended 2017, compared to total other income of $0.03 million in 2016. The change was primarily related to the increase in interest expense and bank changes and partially offset by the increase in realized gain on investments and interest income.\nIncome before provision for income taxes increased by $13.34 million, or 296.6%, to $17.84 million for the year ended 2017 from $4.50 million for the same period of last year\nNet Income\nProvision for income taxes was $2.56 million in 2017, compared to $1.06 million in 2016.\nNet income increased by $11.83 million, or 343.9%, to $15.27 million for 2017 from $3.44 million in 2016.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic and diluted earnings per share were $0.21 for the year ended 2017, compared to $0.05 for 2016.\nLoan Portfolio\nFor the Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2015\nNumber of Borrowers\n8,047\n1,067\n571\nRepeat borrower rate\n8%\n15%\n9%\nNumber of investors\n69,232\n39,999\n43,302\nRepeat investor rate\n55%\n56%\n42%\nNumber of loans\n23,263\n8,739\n2,818\nValue of loans ($ millions)\n$1,308.7\n$818.5\n$513.0\nAverage loan amount ($)\n$56,258\n$93,658\n$182,039\nLoans outstanding -EoP ($ millions)\n$436.3\n$246.1\n$186.0\nFor the year ended 2017, the Company facilitated 23,263 loans with an aggregate loan amount of $1,308.7 million.
