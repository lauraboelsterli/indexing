Work on the plants in Crimea, a region Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, has been hampered by sanctions barring the import of Western technology to the peninsula. German engineering firm Siemens has alleged that Russia delivered its turbines to Crimea for use in the two plants without its knowledge.
