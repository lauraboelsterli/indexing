    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS, March 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Precision Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:AIPT) (“Precision” or “the Company”), formerly Skyline Medical, a company focused on applying artificial intelligence to personalized medicine and drug discovery, announced today that it has converted a previous $500,000 loan to Helomics into a 5% equity stake. This follows the purchase of preferred stock convertible into 20% of the outstanding common stock of Helomics Corporation in January 2018, bringing the Company’s total ownership of Helomics to 25%.\nHeadquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Helomics has established operations that bridge two emerging areas of the healthcare industry: precision medicine and big data. Helomics’ competitive advantage lies in its proprietary D-CHIP™ database, which contains de-identified data compiled from more than a decade of clinical testing of tumor responses to drugs, coupled to an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered bioinformatics engine which generates actionable scientific insights from this rich data. These insights are used by BioPharma companies in the research and development of targeted cancer treatments for any given patient profile, driving improved patient outcomes.\nDr. Carl Schwartz, Chief Executive Officer of Precision Therapeutics, commented, “We are pleased to increase our equity stake in Helomics as we rapidly advance our strategy to position Precision Therapeutics as a leading provider of CRO and diagnostic services to the precision medicine market. Our aim is to facilitate the development of personalized cancer treatments by bringing together some of the most advanced bioinformatics and artificial intelligence technologies on the market, and applying them to the fast-growing precision medicine space. We will leverage Helomics’s proprietary D–Chip AI platform, which contains the drug response profiles of over 149,000 patient tumors, in collaboration with our next generation patient derived (“PDx”) TumorGenesis tumor models, to provide actionable insights for clients in the pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and biotech sectors. We intend to build out the D–Chip’s high-quality data set in order to drive new client agreements, improve patient outcomes and grow revenues.”\nAbout Precision Therapeutics Inc.\nPrecision Therapeutics (NASDAQ:AIPT) operates in two business areas: first, applying artificial intelligence to personalized medicine and drug discovery to provide personalized medicine solutions for clients in the pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and biotech industries, and second, production of the FDA-approved STREAMWAY® System for automated, direct-to-drain medical fluid disposal.\nPrecision Therapeutics' CRO services business is committed to improving the effectiveness of cancer therapy using the power of artificial intelligence (AI) applied to rich data diseases databases. This business has launched with Precision Therapeutics' investment in Helomics Corporation, a precision diagnostic company and integrated clinical contract research organization whose mission is to improve patient care by partnering with pharmaceutical, diagnostic, and academic organizations to bring innovative clinical products and technologies to the marketplace. In addition to its proprietary precision diagnostics for oncology, Helomics offers boutique CRO services that leverage our patient-derived tumor models, coupled to a wide range of multi-omics assays (genomics, proteomics and biochemical), and a proprietary bioinformatics platform (D-CHIP) to provide a tailored solution to our client's specific needs. Helomics is 25% owned by Precision Therapeutics. Helomics® is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where the company maintains state-of-the-art, CLIA-certified, clinical and research laboratories. For more information, please visit www.Helomics.com .\nPrecision Therapeutics has also announced the formation of a subsidiary, TumorGenesis to pursue a new rapid approach to growing tumors in the laboratory, which essentially “fools” the cancer cells into thinking they are still growing inside the patient.\nPrecision Therapeutics and Helomics have also announced a proposed joint venture with GLG Pharma focused on using their combined technologies to bring personalized medicines and testing to ovarian and breast cancer patients, especially those who present with ascites fluid (over one-third of patients). The growth strategy in this business includes securing new partnerships and considering acquisitions in the precision medicine space.\nSold through the Skyline Medical business of Precision Therapeutics, The STREAMWAY System virtually eliminates staff exposure to blood, irrigation fluid and other potentially infectious fluids found in the healthcare environment. Antiquated manual fluid handling methods that require hand carrying and emptying filled fluid canisters present an exposure risk and potential liability. Skyline Medical's STREAMWAY System fully automates the collection, measurement, and disposal of waste fluids and is designed to: 1) reduce overhead costs to hospitals and surgical centers; 2) improve compliance with OSHA and other regulatory agency safety guidelines; 3) improve efficiency in the operating room, and radiology and endoscopy departments, thereby leading to greater profitability; and 4) provide greater environmental stewardship by helping to eliminate the approximately 50 million potentially disease-infected canisters that go into landfills each year in the U.S. For additional information, please visit www.skylinemedical.com .\nForward-looking Statements\nCertain of the matters discussed in this announcement contain that involve material risks to and uncertainties in the Company's business that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the statements made herein.
