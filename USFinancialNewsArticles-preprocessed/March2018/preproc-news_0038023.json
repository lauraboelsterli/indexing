    "text": "SEATTLE, WA, March 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CFN Media Group (\"CannabisFN\"), the leading creative agency and media network dedicated to legal cannabis, announces publication of an article covering Helix TCS Inc.'s (OTCQB: HLIX) recently announced merger agreement with Bio-Tech Medical Software Inc., dba BioTrackTHC, after acquiring a growing stake in the firm over the past several quarters. The move helps create one of the most promising pure play ancillary businesses in the burgeoning cannabis industry. Also included is an exclusive video interview , filmed just prior to the merger announcement, with company CEO Zachary L. Venegas.\nMany investors look at the cannabis industry and see opportunities for cultivators (growers) and dispensaries (retailers). But, there are many other types of companies that are well positioned to profit from the industry’s substantial growth rates. Many of these companies also sidestep the risks assumed by growers and retailers that must touch the federally-illegal drug, which makes them a compelling addition to a well-rounded portfolio.\nAncillary Businesses\nThe cannabis industry is projected to reach $50 billion by 2026, according to Cowen & Co. , driven by the legalization of adult-use and medical cannabis across a growing number of states. While many investors are focused on cultivators and dispensaries, ancillary businesses are poised to capture an even larger share of the market without the legal and financial risks that apply to working directly with the cannabis plant.\nHelix TCS has focused on providing integrated operating environment solutions to the legal cannabis industry, including transportation, armed and unarmed guarding, training, investigation, and special services. At the same time, the company’s Cannabase is the oldest and largest wholesale platform in the industry, helping over 72 percent of all cannabis licensees in Colorado improve their sales and marketing efforts.\nBioTrackTHC develops and licenses product traceability, inventory management, and point-of-sale software systems for the legal cannabis industry. With nine government contracts and over 2,200 installed systems, the company has become a leader in software systems that enable government regulators and licensed operators to track and capture data on cannabis from the point of inception through the product life cycle.\nPotential Synergies\nBy leveraging its existing client base, the company has been rapidly growing its Cannabase operations, which provides proprietary insights into the industry. These insights are quickly becoming a key asset in the highly competitive market where cultivators and dispensaries are willing to pay for an edge.\n“The synergies between Cannabase and BioTrack are significant and we will use them as a starting point for an industry defining platform,” said Helix TCS CEO Zachary L. Venegas in the press release announcing the merger. “The combined firm’s increased scope, linked with our focus on execution, will continue to set the standard for M&A in the industry. We are confident that this merger will enable the combined companies to accelerate growth.”\nCannabase can provide real-time market insights to wholesale growers and retailers, which helps them anticipate market trends, price changes, and volume fluctuations in both the adult-use and medical markets. In addition, the platform provides analytics to advertisers that are looking to market to growers and dispensaries, which helps them optimize their product and service offerings to match what these companies - and consumer demand - requires.\nLooking Ahead\nHelix TCS Inc. (OTCQB: HLIX) represents a compelling investment opportunity in the burgeoning cannabis industry. After its BioTrackTHC merger, the company has become perhaps the largest ancillary products and services provider, while setting the stage to capture unmatched data fields across the cannabis value chain. The latter development is important to companies who value the ability to use data and analytics to improve their business operations and predictive analytics.\nPlease follow the link to read the full article: http://www.cannabisfn.com/helix-tcs-merger-biotrackthc-means-investors-plus-exclusive-ceo-video-interview/\nFor more information, visit the company’s website at www.helixtcs.com .\nAbout CFN Media\nCFN Media (CannabisFN) is the leading creative agency and media network dedicated to legal cannabis.
