    "text": "3 COMMENTS A special committee of Nordstrom Inc.’s JWN -2.30% board of directors has terminated discussions with members of the founding Nordstrom family who were trying to take the company private.\nThe committee at the high-end department store chain said Tuesday discussions ended after it couldn’t reach agreement with the family on an “acceptable price” for the company.\nNordstrom shares, which had gained 16% over the past year, fell 2.3% to $48.23 in after-hours trading.\nLast month, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Nordstrom family experienced a second setback when the committee rejected their roughly $8 billion buyout offer as too low.\nThe buyout group, which included private-equity firm Leonard Green & Partners, offered $50 a share, a price that was below the company’s closing price at the time. As part of the deal, the group was planning to buy 21% of the family’s current stake, allowing the heirs to cash out about $550 million of their ownership in the retail chain.\nThe family’s shares are mostly held by Bruce Nordstrom, a grandson of the founder and a former CEO, and his sister, Anne Gittinger. The group also includes Bruce’s sons, Blake, Peter and Erik, who hold the title of co-president, and James Nordstrom, their cousin, who is president of stores.\nTogether, the six family members own about one-third of the company’s stock.\nThe family said in a March 5 letter to the special committee that a go-private transaction would give the company flexibility to “navigate a challenging retail landscape.”\nOn Tuesday, the committee said the retailer has gained market share and its e-commerce business has grown, “fueled by investments in digital capabilities to expand customer reach and engagement.”\nThe family had suspended its efforts in October after failing to raise enough financing for the leveraged buyout ahead of the holidays.\nFounded in Seattle in 1901 by a Swedish immigrant, Nordstrom is one of the few department store chains still under family management. The company has been investing heavily to try to adapt to the rise in online shopping.\nNordstrom reported a profit of $437 million on revenue of $15.1 billion in the fiscal year ended Feb. 3. It ended the period with $2.68 billion in long-term debt.\n—Suzanne Kapner contributed to this article.\nWrite to Aisha Al-Muslim at aisha.al-muslim@wsj.com",
