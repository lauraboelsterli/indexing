    "text": "NEW YORK, March 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- WhiteHorse Finance, Inc. (\"WhiteHorse Finance\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: WHF) today announced its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Summary Highlights\nNew investments of $22.7 million and $111.0 million for the fourth quarter and year, respectively Net investment income of $6.8 million, or $0.331 per share, for the fourth quarter Annual net investment income of $26.2 million, or $1.35 per share Period-ending NAV of $13.98 per share compared to $13.63 per share in 2016 Annual distribution of $1.42 per share\nStuart Aronson, WhiteHorse Finance's Chief Executive Officer commented, \"During the fourth quarter, we originated several first-lien, senior-secured loans that enhanced the quality of our already strong portfolio while preserving an attractive yield. These results illustrate the impact of our three-tiered sourcing architecture, which differentiates us in the lower-middle market by facilitating access to both the sponsor and non-sponsor markets and allowing us to maintain a disciplined approach to capital deployment. We are optimistic about our pipeline for the first quarter.\"\nPortfolio and Investment Activity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the fair value of WhiteHorse Finance's investment portfolio was $440.7 million, compared with $411.7 million as of December 31, 2016. The portfolio at December 31, 2017 consisted of 43 positions across 32 companies with an average investment size of $10.2 million and a weighted average effective yield of 11.9%. The majority of the portfolio was comprised of senior secured loans, and these loans were substantially all variable-rate investments (primarily indexed to LIBOR), which should continue to position the portfolio well for a potential rising interest rate environment.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017, WhiteHorse Finance made investments in three new portfolio companies totaling $22.7 million. Gross proceeds from sales and repayments totaled $26.2 million for the quarter. In addition, WhiteHorse Finance refinanced its $13.8 million second lien loan to Multicultural Radio Broadcasting, Inc. into a new first lien loan, increasing its position by adding a net $5.8 million. The Company remained highly selective in deploying new investments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, WhiteHorse Finance invested $111.0 million across ten new portfolio companies. Also, the Company invested $6.6 million in existing portfolio companies exclusive of refinancing. Gross proceeds from sales and repayments totaled $106.3 million for the year exclusive of refinancing activities.\nResults of Operations\nFor the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, net investment income was approximately $6.8 million and $26.2 million, respectively, compared with approximately $6.6 million and $27.0 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease in net investment income for the year-over-year period was primarily attributable to an increase in interest expense resulting from higher interest rates and higher borrowing balances on the Company's line of credit facility as well as a lower average on the total principal amount of investments as compared to the prior year.\nFor the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, WhiteHorse Finance reported net realized and unrealized gains on investments of $1.7 million and $8.2 million, respectively. This compares with net realized and unrealized gains on investments of $2.5 million and $4.3 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively. The increase in net realized and unrealized gains on investments for the year-over-year period was primarily attributable to favorable fair value adjustments on an aggregate basis.\nWhiteHorse Finance reported a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of approximately $8.5 million and $34.4 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, which compares with a net increase of $9.1 million and $31.3 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.\nWhiteHorse Finance's NAV was $287.0 million, or $13.98 per share, as of December 31, 2017, as compared with $285.5 million, or $13.92 per share, as of September 30, 2017. As of December 31, 2016, WhiteHorse Finance's NAV was $249.4 million, or $13.63 per share.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, WhiteHorse Finance had cash and cash equivalents of $38.9 million, as compared with $41.9 million as of September 30, 2017, inclusive of restricted cash. As of December 31, 2017, the Company also had $45.0 million of undrawn capacity under its revolving credit facility.\nDistributions\nOn December 6, 2017, the Company declared a distribution of $0.355 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, consistent for the twenty-first consecutive quarter since the Company's IPO. The distribution was paid on January 2, 2018 to shareholders of record as of December 18, 2017.\nDistributions are paid from taxable earnings and may include return of capital and/or capital gains. The specific tax characteristics of the distributions will be reported to stockholders on Form 1099-DIV after the end of the calendar year and in the Company's periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nConference Call\nWhiteHorse Finance will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and fiscal year-end results at 10:00 am ET on Friday, March 2, 2018.

The one, three and six-month LIBOR were 1.6%, 1.7% and 1.8%, respectively, as of December 31, 2017. The Prime was 4.5% as of December 31, 2017.\n(3)\nThe interest rate is the ''all-in-rate'' including the current index and spread, the ﬁxed rate, and the payment-in-kind (''PIK'') interest rate, as the case may be.\n(4)\nThe investment or a portion of the investment does not provide collateral for the Company's credit facility.\n(5)\nNot a qualifying asset under Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act. Under the 1940 Act, the Company may not acquire any non-qualifying asset unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of total assets. Qualifying assets represented 82% of total assets as of the date of the consolidated schedule of investments.\n(6)\nInvestment is a non-controlled/affiliate investment as deﬁned by the 1940 Act.\n(7)\nExcept as otherwise noted, the fair value of each investment was determined using signiﬁcant Unobservable inputs.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/whitehorse-finance-inc-announces-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-earnings-results-300607278.html\nSOURCE WhiteHorse Finance, Inc.",
