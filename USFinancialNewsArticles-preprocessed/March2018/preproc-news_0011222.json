The yield on Germany’s 10-year government bond, the benchmark for the region, was lower by 1 basis point at 0.66 percent.\nFrance’s 10-year borrowing cost dipped 2 bps to 0.91 percent, well off February’s high of 1.06 percent.\nThough final 2017 euro zone GDP numbers are due at 1000 GMT, the focus will shift back to the United States later on Wednesday, with private employment data from the ADP Research Institute due to be released at 1315 GMT.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve’s Lael Brainard said that she has greater confidence that gradual rate hikes are needed.\nTUTTE BENE Meanwhile, the Italy-Germany 10-year government bond yield spread tightened further to 139 bps and was approaching pre-election levels on Tuesday, as investors appeared to put this weekend’s vote behind them.\nSilvio Berlusconi said in a newspaper interview on Wednesday he will support the leader of Italy’s eurosceptic party the League in attempts to form a government.\nYet the effect on spreads and on the euro was minimal; the single currency was actually higher at $1.2415.\n“Spreads more broadly may have some more breathing room as the actual government formation discussions in Italy do not look set to kick off for real until later this month when parliament convenes for the first time,” ING strategists said in a note.
