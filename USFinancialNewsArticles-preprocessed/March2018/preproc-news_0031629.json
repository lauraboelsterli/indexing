    "text": "SÃO PAULO, Brazil—The shooting of a Rio de Janeiro activist and critic of police abuses has caused angry outbursts across Brazil and deepened concerns over President Michel Temer’s use of the army to control violence, ahead of national elections in October. \nMarielle Franco, a Rio city councilwoman and a prominent defender of Afro-Brazilians, was shot dead in her car Wednesday night along with her driver, in what human-rights groups fear was a politically motivated execution in retaliation for her criticism of police violence.\n... RELATED VIDEO Brazil’s President Temer on Corruption and Being Unpopular Brazil's President Michel Temer is the most unpopular leader to have held the post, according to opinion polls. He tells WSJ’s Stephen Fidler why the rating doesn’t concern him and why he would prefer to face former leader Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva at the polls.  ",
