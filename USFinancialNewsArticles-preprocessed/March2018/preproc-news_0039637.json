    "text": "STEVENSON, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The securities litigation law firm of Brower Piven, A Professional Corporation, has commenced an investigation into possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of state law by the Board of Directors of MuleSoft, Inc. (NYSE: MULE) (“MuleSoft” or the “Company”) relating to the proposed buyout of MuleSoft by salesforce.com, inc.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, MuleSoft shareholders are anticipated to receive in $36.00 in cash and 0.0711 shares of salesforce stock for each Class A or Class B share of MuleSoft held. Based on the closing price of salesforce stock on March 19, 2018, this represents $44.89 per share.\nThe firm’s investigation seeks to determine, among other things, whether the Company’s Board of Directors failed to satisfy their duties to shareholders, including whether the Board adequately pursued alternatives to the acquisition and whether the Board obtained the best price possible for the Company’s shares of common stock.\nIf you currently own common stock of MuleSoft and believe that the proposed buyout price is too low, and you would like to learn more about the investigation being conducted, without cost or obligation to you, please contact Brower Piven either by email at hoffman@browerpiven.com or by telephone at (410) 415-6616.\nAttorneys at Brower Piven have extensive experience in litigating securities and other class action cases and have been advocating for the rights of shareholders since the 1980s.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180322006286/en/\nBrower Piven, A Professional Corporation\nCharles J.
