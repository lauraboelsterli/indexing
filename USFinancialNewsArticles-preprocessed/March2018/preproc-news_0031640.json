    "text": "Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards resigned suddenly amid complaints about poor workplace conduct, The Wall Street Journal reported.\nEdwards, whom many considered a potential successor to CEO Mark Parker, resigned effective immediately on Thursday, according to an internal memo from Parker, obtained by the Journal. Edwards will retire from the company in August.\nThe memo said the company had received reports of \"behavior occurring within our organization that do not reflect our core values of inclusivity, respect and empowerment.\"\nParker did not disclose the nature of the complaints or whether they involved Edwards directly. A Nike spokesman told the Journal there were no allegations against Edwards and declined to provide details.\n\"This has been a very difficult time,\" Parker wrote in the memo.\nParker said Nike would be reviewing the company's protocol for dealing with internal complaints, the Journal reported. Furthermore, to deal with Edwards' unplanned absence, Parker said he will remain chairman and CEO of Nike beyond 2020.\nNike did not immediately return CNBC's request for comment.\nRead more about Trevor Edwards' departure from Nike from the Wall Street Journal.\nWATCH: Nike ripe for a buy, says top technician show chapters One of the top Dow stocks this week is ripe for a buy, top technician says 11:02 AM ET Thu, 15 March 2018 | 04:45",
