    "text": "SAN DIEGO, March 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ARNA) today announced the pricing of an underwritten public offering of 8,500,000 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $41.50 per share. All of the shares are being sold by Arena. The gross proceeds from the offering are expected to be approximately $352.8 million, before deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. The offering is expected to close on March 26, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. In addition, Arena has granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,275,000 additional shares of its common stock at the public offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions.\nArena anticipates using the net proceeds from the offering for the clinical and preclinical development of drug candidates, including its planned Phase 3 programs for etrasimod for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and ralinepag for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, for general corporate purposes, including working capital and costs associated with manufacturing services, and for capital expenditures.\nCitigroup, Leerink Partners, Cantor Fitzgerald, Credit Suisse and RBC Capital Markets are acting as joint book-running managers for the offering. Guggenheim Securities and JMP Securities are acting as co-managers for the offering.\nThe shares of common stock described above are being offered by Arena pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed by Arena with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that became automatically effective on July 11, 2017.

Our three most advanced clinical programs are: ralinepag (APD811), which we are currently preparing for a Phase 3 program for pulmonary arterial hypertension; etrasimod (APD334), for which we are planning a Phase 3 program for ulcerative colitis and are continuing to study for other immune and inflammatory conditions; and APD371 for visceral pain conditions and which is being studied in a Phase 2 trial for treatment of pain associated with Crohn's disease. In addition, we have collaborations with the following pharmaceutical companies: Everest Medicines Limited (ralinepag and etrasimod in Greater China and select countries in Asia), Axovant Sciences GmbH (nelotanserin - Phase 2), Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH (undisclosed target - preclinical), and Eisai Co., Ltd. and Eisai Inc. (BELVIQ®/BELVIQ XR® - marketed products).\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this press release are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. These statements may be identified by introductory words such as \"may,\" \"expects,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"will,\" \"achieve,\" \"anticipate,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"subject to\" or words of similar meaning, or by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements include statements regarding Arena's expectations with respect to the completion, timing and size of the public offering, and Arena's anticipated use of the net proceeds from the offering. For such statements, Arena claims the protection of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual events or results may differ materially from Arena's expectations. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties associated with market conditions and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions related to the public offering; and those factors disclosed in Arena's filings with the SEC, including our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
