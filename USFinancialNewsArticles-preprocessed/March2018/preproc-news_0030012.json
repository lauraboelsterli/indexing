(Matrixx), a leading consumer healthcare business, which does business under the Zicam brand.\nDana's Managing Member Joe Falsetti commented, \"In February 2011, Dana partnered with H.I.G Capital (H.I.G), a Miami-based private equity firm with $24 billion of equity capital under management, to acquire Matrixx in a take-private transaction.

We look forward to the continued success of Matrixx and wish the new owners the best success.\"\nAbout Dana Holdings :\nDana Holdings is an independent sponsor with an established track record of identifying and creating value in the consumer healthcare sector.
