    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- USD Partners LP (NYSE: USDP) (the “Partnership”) announced today its operating and financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Highlights with respect to the fourth quarter of 2017 include the following:\nSuccessfully commenced operations at the Stroud destination terminal near Cushing, Oklahoma Generated Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities of $9.5 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $12.5 million and Distributable Cash Flow of $9.8 million Reported Net Income of $2.2 million Increased quarterly cash distribution to $0.35 per unit ($1.40 per unit on an annualized basis), delivering distribution growth of 7.5% for the full year 2017 Ended quarter with $205.9 million of available liquidity and distribution coverage of 1.1x\n“Recently, the price of Western Canadian Select has significantly declined relative to the price of alternative grades of crude oil as a result of increased oil sands production, apportionment on pipelines, and full utilization of storage at the Hardisty hub,” said Dan Borgen, the Partnership’s Chief Executive Officer. “Given the value that our terminals can deliver to our customers in this environment, we are well-positioned to execute on multiple near-term opportunities for contract extensions, new customer agreements and potential expansions to our existing network. As these opportunities materialize, we expect to deliver mid-single digit distribution growth in 2018 relative to 2017.”\nMarket Update\nOver the last several months, oil sands production facilities in Western Canada have returned to normal operating levels and meaningful new production capacity has been brought online. Additionally, one of the major export pipelines to the United States experienced a disruption. The resulting balance of growing crude oil supply versus available pipeline infrastructure caused the price of Western Canadian Select (“WCS”) crude oil in Hardisty, Alberta, to discount meaningfully relative to key benchmarks and alternative heavy feedstocks for refiners, such as Maya in the Gulf Coast.\nThis dislocation in prices incentivizes producers to find additional modes of transportation to reach other markets where they might achieve better pricing and attracts refiners that seek access to a cheaper feedstock. In this environment, strategically-located rail terminals, such as the Partnership’s Hardisty, Casper and Stroud terminals, deliver critical takeaway capacity and can preserve substantial value for Western Canadian crude oil.\nProduction from the oil sands in Western Canada is projected to continue to grow, and the expected timing of proposed export pipeline additions remains uncertain. As such, forward curves in the market currently reflect a discount for WCS relative to West Texas Intermediate of approximately $20 for the next several years. Combined, these dynamics create opportunities for market participants to utilize rail transportation to capture incremental value over that period.\nRecent Developments\nCustomer activity at the Hardisty origination terminal has increased substantially over the last several months. Current market demand for the services provided at the Hardisty terminal exceeds the available capacity, as substantially all of the terminal’s capacity was previously contracted for by customers under multi-year agreements through mid-2019 or mid-2020. As such, the Partnership’s sponsor is evaluating a potential expansion to meet near-term demand. The Partnership is also actively negotiating with current customers to extend the terms of the existing take-or-pay agreements.\nThe Stroud terminal successfully commenced operations on October 1, 2017, after the planned retrofit work necessary to handle heavier grades of crude oil was completed on time and under the Partnership’s initial budget. Concurrent with the acquisition of the Stroud terminal in June of 2017, the Partnership entered into a new multi-year, take-or-pay terminalling services agreement with an investment grade rated, multi-national energy company (the “Stroud customer”) for the use of approximately 50% of the Stroud terminal’s available capacity through June 30, 2020. Per the original agreement, the contracted take-or-pay volumes with the Stroud customer increased to 30,000 barrels per day on January 1, 2018, up from 20,000 barrels per day during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe Partnership’s sponsor is currently negotiating with potential customers for both the remaining capacity at the Stroud terminal, as well as potential expansion capacity. These initiatives could grow the Partnership’s existing comprehensive origin-to-destination solution from Hardisty to the Stroud terminal near the Cushing storage hub and represent potential drop down acquisition opportunities for the Partnership.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Partnership used recently-available tank capacity at the Casper terminal to support spot shipments for a large international oil and gas company, as well as for a local producer’s heavy sour crude oil production. The Partnership is actively pursuing term agreements with these spot customers for ongoing use of the Casper terminal. Additionally, the Partnership is exploring the potential to establish rail-to-pipeline capabilities at the Casper terminal, similar to the current activity at the Stroud terminal.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Operational and Financial Results\nSubstantially all of the Partnership’s cash flows are generated from multi-year, take-or-pay terminal service agreements related to its crude oil terminals, which include minimum monthly commitment fees. The Partnership’s customers include major integrated oil companies, refiners and marketers, the majority of which are investment grade rated.\nThe Partnership’s results during the fourth quarter of 2017 relative to the same quarter in 2016 were primarily influenced by the conclusion of customer contracts at the Casper and San Antonio terminals, as well as revenues and costs associated with the commencement of operations at the Stroud terminal. The Partnership also incurred additional operating costs to support a substantial increase in customer activity at its Hardisty terminal during the quarter.\nThe Partnership utilizes derivative contracts to mitigate the exposure to fluctuations in the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar on the Partnership’s results of operations. These derivative contracts secured an exchange rate of 0.78 U.S. dollars per Canadian dollar in 2017 versus 0.84 U.S. dollars per Canadian dollar in 2016, which resulted in a cash outflow of $0.2 million upon settlement in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus a cash inflow of $0.8 million in the same quarter of the prior year.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, the Partnership benefitted from the receipt of a tax refund totaling $1.3 million, whereas the Partnership did not receive a refund nor pay cash taxes during the fourth quarter of 2017. Partially offsetting the items previously discussed, the Partnership recorded a lower provision for income and withholding taxes of approximately $0.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus $1.1 million in the same quarter of the previous year.\nAs a result, Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities decreased by 41%, while Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow decreased by 26% and 39%, respectively, relative to the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income for the quarter decreased by 44% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Partnership had total available liquidity of $205.9 million, including $7.9 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and undrawn borrowing capacity of $198.0 million on its $400.0 million senior secured credit facility, subject to continued compliance with financial covenants. The Partnership is in compliance with its financial covenants and has no maturities under its senior secured credit facility until October 2019.\nOn February 1, 2018, the Partnership declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.35 per unit ($1.40 per unit on an annualized basis), which represents growth of 1.4% relative to the third quarter of 2017 and 6.1% relative to the fourth quarter of 2016. The distribution was paid on February 16, 2018, to unitholders of record as of February 12, 2018.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Conference Call Information\nThe Partnership will host a conference call and webcast regarding fourth quarter 2017 results at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (10:00 a.m. Central Time) on Friday, March 9, 2018.\nTo listen live over the Internet, participants are advised to log on to the Partnership’s website at www.usdpartners.com and select the “Events & Presentations” sub-tab under the “Investors” tab.

In addition, a replay of the audio webcast will be available by accessing the Partnership's website after the call is concluded.\nAbout USD Partners LP\nUSD Partners LP is a fee-based, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed in 2014 by US Development Group, LLC (“USDG”) to acquire, develop and operate midstream infrastructure and complementary logistics solutions for crude oil, biofuels and other energy-related products. The Partnership generates substantially all of its operating cash flows from multi-year, take-or-pay contracts with primarily investment grade customers, including major integrated oil companies, refiners and marketers. The Partnership’s network of crude oil terminals facilitates the transportation of heavy crude oil from Western Canada to key demand centers across North America. The Partnership’s operations include railcar loading and unloading, storage and blending in on-site tanks, inbound and outbound pipeline connectivity, truck transloading, as well as other related logistics services.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP, supplemental financial measure used by management and external users of the Partnership’s financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess:\nthe Partnership’s liquidity and the ability of the Partnership’s businesses to produce sufficient cash flows to make distributions to the Partnership’s unitholders; and the Partnership’s ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures.\nThe Partnership defines Distributable Cash Flow, or DCF, as Adjusted EBITDA less net cash paid for interest, income taxes and maintenance capital expenditures. DCF does not reflect changes in working capital balances. DCF is a non-GAAP, supplemental financial measure used by management and by external users of the Partnership’s financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess:\nthe amount of cash available for making distributions to the Partnership’s unitholders; the excess cash being retained for use in enhancing the Partnership’s existing businesses; and the sustainability of the Partnership’s current distribution rate per unit.\nThe Partnership believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and DCF in this press release provides information that enhances an investor's understanding of the Partnership’s ability to generate cash for payment of distributions and other purposes. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and DCF is Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF should not be considered alternatives to Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities or any other measure of liquidity or performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and DCF exclude some, but not all, items that affect cash from operations and these measures may vary among other companies. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA and DCF may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws, including statements with respect to the ability of the Partnership to achieve contract extensions, new customer agreements and expansions; the ability of the Partnership’s Sponsor to develop additional projects and expansion opportunities and whether those projects and opportunities would be made available for acquisition, or acquired, by the Partnership; and the amount and timing of future distribution payments and distribution growth. Words and phrases such as “is expected,” “is planned,” “believes,” “projects,” and similar expressions are used to identify such . However, the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements relating to the Partnership are based on management’s expectations, estimates and projections about the Partnership, its interests and the energy industry in general on the date this press release was issued. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict.
