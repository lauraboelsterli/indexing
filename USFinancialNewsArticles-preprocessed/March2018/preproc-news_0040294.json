In addition, the Company announced that Ricardo Rodriguez has been appointed to the role of Chief Financial Officer at Spirit MTA REIT, and will start in May 2018.\n\"We are pleased to announce that Michael Hughes will join us as Chief Financial Officer, a critical role as we complete our spin-off transaction and focus on external growth. Michael has extensive leadership experience at a public REIT, and his deep knowledge of corporate finance and reporting, balance sheet management and transaction execution will serve us well.
