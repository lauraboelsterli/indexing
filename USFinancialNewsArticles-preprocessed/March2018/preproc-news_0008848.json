    "text": "March 4, 2018 / 4:41 PM / Updated 27 minutes ago Levante sack coach Muniz after long winless streak Reuters Staff 2 Min Read VALENCIA (Reuters) - La Liga strugglers Levante sacked their coach Juan Ramon Lopez Muniz on Sunday after a run of 15 league games without a win left them one point above the relegation zone. Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - Levante vs Real Madrid - Ciutat de Valencia, Valencia, Spain - February 3, 2018 Levante coach Juan Ramon Lopez Muniz REUTERS/Heino Kalis The club announced the decision in a statement on their official website (www.levanteud.com) not long after their 1-1 draw at home to Espanyol, when a stoppage-time equaliser by Leo Baptistao denied them a first victory since Nov. 19. “Levante would like to thank Muniz and his coaching staff for their work and dedication during their time in the Levante dugout, in which they won promotion to La Liga, and we wish him all the luck in the future on a personal and professional level,” added the statement. Muniz took over at Levante in June 2016 after they had been relegated from the top flight and led them to promotion in his debut campaign as they stormed to the Segunda Division A title. Levante are 17th in the Liga standings on 21 points, one above Las Palmas, who occupy the last relegation spot and can leapfrog the Valencia side if they beat Celta Vigo on Monday.
