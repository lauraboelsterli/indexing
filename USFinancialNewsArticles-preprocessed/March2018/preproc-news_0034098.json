Special Counsel Robert Mueller (R) departs after briefing members of the U.S. Senate on his investigation into potential collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 21, 2017. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts Spokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters on the Air Force One flight carrying Trump to New Hampshire that Trump’s weekend tweets criticizing Mueller by name do not presage a firing. “The president is not moving to get rid of Robert Mueller,” he said. He said the tweets reflected “some well-established frustration” felt by Trump over the Russian investigation. Reporting By Roberta Rampton; Editing by Tom Brown",
