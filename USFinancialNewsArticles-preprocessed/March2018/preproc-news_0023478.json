FILE PHOTO: The logo of AstraZeneca is seen on medication packages in a pharmacy in London April 28, 2014. REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth/File Photo The Phase III trial, known as Mystic, is testing Imfinzi on its own and in combination with tremelimumab, and the drugmaker noted in a brief statement on Monday that it was driven by clinical events among patients involved. First results from Mystic disappointed investors last July when AstraZenecaâ€™s two drugs proved no more effective at stopping disease progression than chemotherapy, sending its shares tumbling.
