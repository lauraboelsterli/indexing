    "text": "NABLUS, West Bank (Reuters) - A Palestinian was shot and killed on Saturday in what began as a clash between Palestinians and Israeli settlers in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian health officials said.\nBoth sides blamed the other for instigating the violence that erupted between residents of a Jewish settlement and a nearby Palestinian village.\nThe Israeli military said soldiers arrived at the scene and “used riot dispersal means and fired live rounds.”\nThe incident, it said, would be reviewed.\nPalestinian officials said a 19-year-old was killed and a second person was wounded, but it was unclear whether they were shot by Israeli soldiers or settlers.\nSome 550,000 Israelis live in West Bank settlements and East Jerusalem, areas that are home to more than 2.6 million Palestinians.\nReporting by Ali Sawafta and Nidal al-Mughrabi; Editing by Stephen Powell\n ",
