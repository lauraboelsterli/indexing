View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180315006008/en/\nSES Successfully Prices €500 Million 8-Year Euro Bond (Photo: Business Wire)\nSES is rated Baa2 by Moody’s (with stable outlook) and BBB by Standard & Poor’s (with stable outlook). Proceeds of the issuance will be used for general corporate purposes (which includes the refinancing of existing debt).\nWith this transaction, SES has taken advantage of the current attractive market conditions to further strengthen its liquidity profile ahead of a EUR 500 million senior debt maturity later this year and issue a bond with the lowest coupon in the company's history.\nBBVA, BNP Paribas, Commerzbank, HSBC, ING and J.P. Morgan acted as joint bookrunners. The settlement is scheduled for 22 March 2018 and application has been made for the notes to be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The securities were placed with a broad range of institutional investors across Europe.\nPadraig McCarthy, Chief Financial Officer of SES, commented: “We are pleased to have secured this financing which allows us to proactively refinance an upcoming debt maturity at more favourable terms. The successful conclusion of this bond offering reflects the market's view of SES as a strong investment grade credit, and underlines our ability to secure funding at attractive terms.\"\nThe securities have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons absent registration or unless pursuant to an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable securities laws.

This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities, nor shall it constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.\nThis announcement does not constitute and shall not, in any circumstances, constitute a public offering nor an invitation to the public in connection with any offer within the meaning of the Directive 2003/71/EC of the Parliament and Council of November 4, 2003 as implemented by the Member States of the European Economic Area (the “Prospectus Directive”). With respect to the member States of the European Economic Area which have implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a “relevant member State”), no action has been undertaken or will be undertaken to make an offer to the public of the securities requiring a publication of a prospectus in any relevant member State.
