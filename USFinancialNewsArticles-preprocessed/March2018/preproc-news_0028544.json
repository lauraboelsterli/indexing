    "text": "STG Expands Presence into Pacific Northwest and Canada\nCHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- St. George Logistics (“STG”), North America’s leading provider of specialty 3PL and transportation services critical to the global supply chain, has expanded its leading import/export presence into the Pacific Northwest and Canada through the acquisition of Summit Northwest Corp. (“Summit”). Summit’s management, led by Co-Founder and President Bob Hodson, Matt Hodson and Sabine Morris, will continue with the business and will join STG as shareholders and senior members of its regional operations team.\nFounded in 1999, Summit is a comprehensive import/export logistics provider in the gateway cities of Seattle-Tacoma, Portland and Vancouver. Summit provides a full suite of value added warehousing and distribution solutions, container freight station services, first and last mile delivery, as well as container drayage, less-than-truckload, full truckload, and cross-border ground transport. Summit’s facilities are custom-bonded and TSA-certified, allowing Summit to play a critical role in providing import/export solutions to air freight forwarders, ocean freight forwarders, airlines, and other providers of international transportation and logistics services.\n“Our expansion into the Pacific Northwest is a critical step in the evolution of STG’s market-leading footprint,” commented Chris Jamroz, Executive Chairman of STG. “While STG maintains leadership in the two largest port systems in the United States – Los Angeles/Long Beach and New York/New Jersey – we have not been able to respond to the incredible demand our customers have for solutions in Seattle-Tacoma, America’s third largest port, or in Portland and Vancouver. We are thrilled that with the addition of Summit, we can now offer our services in these major North American gateways.”\n“STG’s expansion into the Pacific Northwest was driven by our commitment to comprehensively support our customers’ global operations,” said Hessel Verhage, STG’s President and CEO. “STG can now provide a complete array of warehousing, distribution and transportation services in Seattle-Tacoma, Vancouver and Portland, some of the largest, fastest growing and strategically important logistics centers in North America. We are very excited about the conversations we have had with our clients regarding this expansion and we look forward to growing our combined presence in the Northwest U.S. and Canada.”\nKonrad Salaber, Managing Director with Wind Point, commented, “Expanding STG’s presence into major new gateway cities was a critical component of the Value Creation Plan we established with Chris, Hessel and the entire STG team at the outset of our investment. The team has done a great job executing a well-choreographed acquisition strategy and they have complemented that success with a robust integration effort. We look forward to seeing STG continue its development as a premier platform serving the global import/export market.”\nWind Point is an active investor in transportation, logistics and route-based businesses with previous investments including Dicom Transportation Group, Valicor Environmental, RailWorks Corporation and AIR-serv Group.\nAbout St. George Logistics\nSTG (St. George Logistics) is a leading asset-light provider of complex and highly customized logistics and transportation services focused on the global supply chain.
