For each ETN, the Current Yield equals the Coupon Amount, annualized and divided by the Closing Indicative Value, as discussed in more detail below. The Current Yield is not indicative of future coupon payments, if any, on the ETNs. You are not guaranteed any coupon payment or distribution under the ETNs. Coupon payments for the ETNs (if any) are variable and do not represent fixed, periodic interest payments. The Coupon Amount may vary significantly from coupon period to coupon period and may be zero. Any payment on the ETNs is subject to Credit Suisse's ability to pay its obligations as they become due. Accordingly, the Current Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. For more information regarding any ETN's coupon payments, please refer to such ETN's pricing supplement.\n2. The Current Yield for the ETN equals the sum of (i) the Coupon Amount plus (ii) the amount of the ETN's two most recent coupon payments, multiplied by four (to annualize such amounts), divided by the Closing Indicative Value, and rounded to two decimal places for ease of analysis.\n3. On February 12, 2018, the Credit Suisse Nasdaq Gold FLOWS™ 103 Index, the Credit Suisse Nasdaq Silver FLOWS™ 106 Index and the Credit Suisse Nasdaq WTI Crude Oil FLOWS™ 106 Index (the \"Indices\") concluded the notional sale of options on GLD shares, SLV shares and USO shares, respectively, with March 2018 expiration. We expect that the notional cash distribution generated by this sale of options will be withdrawn from the Indices on March 12, 2018, subject to adjustment in the event of any market disruption events. Assuming no redemption or acceleration of GLDI, SLVO and USOI, and that the notional cash distribution is withdrawn from the Indices on March 12, 2018, we expect to declare a Coupon Amount for GLDI, SLVO and USOI, respectively, equal to the corresponding Expected Coupon Amount. The Expected Coupon Amount is subject to change upon the occurrence of a disruption event or other unforeseen circumstances.\n4. For each ETN, the Expected Current Yield equals the Expected Coupon Amount annualized and divided by the Closing Indicative Value, as discussed in more detail below. The Expected Current Yield is not indicative of future coupon payments, if any, on the ETNs. You are not guaranteed any coupon payment or distribution under the ETNs. Coupon payments for the ETNs (if any) are variable and do not represent fixed, periodic interest payments. The Expected Coupon Amount may vary significantly from coupon period to coupon period and may be zero. Any payment on the ETNs is subject to Credit Suisse's ability to pay its obligations as they become due. Accordingly, the Expected Current Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. For more information regarding any ETN's coupon payments, please refer to such ETN's pricing supplement. For each ETN, the Expected Current Yield equals the sum of (i) the Expected Coupon Amount, plus (ii) the amount of the ETN's two most recent coupon payments, multiplied by four (to annualize such amounts), divided by the Closing Indicative Value, and rounded to two decimal places for ease of analysis. The Expected Current Yield is subject to change upon the occurrence of a disruption event or other unforeseen circumstances.\nPress Contact\nAzar Boehm, Credit Suisse AG, telephone +1 212 538 3953, azar.boehm@credit-suisse.com\nCredit Suisse ETNs\nTelephone +1 800 320 1225, ETN.Desk@credit-suisse.com\nThe ETNs may not be suitable for all investors and should be purchased only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of investing in the ETNs.

Investors in the ETNs do not have voting rights, distribution rights or other rights with respect to the assets included in the tracked indices. An investment in the ETNs involves significant risks.
