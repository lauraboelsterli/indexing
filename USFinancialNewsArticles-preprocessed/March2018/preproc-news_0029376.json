Digital Channels segment revenues increased 50.4% to $7.8 million from $5.2 million in fourth quarter 2016. Total net revenue increased 15.3% year-over-year to $32.7 million, primarily driven by the increase in Digital Channels revenue. Wholesale Distribution segment revenue increased 7.9% year-over-year. Gross profit increased 52.0% year-over-year to $14.4 million and Gross margin of 44.2% expanded over 10 percentage points from 33.5% last year.

Equity Earnings from Agatha Christie Limited (ACL) increased 219.5% year-over-year to $2.8 million; ACL film and publishing business segments grew year-over-year, primarily driven by Murder on the Orient Express theatrical release. Net income was $3.8 million, an improvement of $8.1 million from net loss of $4.3 million in fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Highlights\nDigital Channels segment revenue increased 67.2% to $27.2 million on over 50% paying subscriber growth and was 31.5% of 2017 total net revenue compared to 20.3% of 2016 total net revenue.

Gross profit increased 40.7% to $37.1 million and gross margin increased over ten percentage points to 43.0% in 2017 from last year. Continued growth in Digital Channels, representing a larger portion of total revenue, drove the improvements in in gross profit and gross margin. Net loss improved by $15.7 million and was $6.1 million for the year compared to a net loss of $21.9 million last year. Net income adjusted for non-cash warrant expense and 2012 fair value step up amortization would have been positive $1.0 million for 2017 compared to loss of $10.6 million in 2016.

Management believes Adjusted EBITDA to be a meaningful indicator of our performance that provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it removes material non-cash items that allows investors to analyze the operating performance of the business using the same metric management uses. The exclusion of non-cash items better reflects our ability to make investments in the business and meet obligations. Presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in the entertainment industry and by financial analysts and others who follow the industry to measure operating performance. Management uses this measure to assess operating results and performance of our business, perform analytical comparisons, identify strategies to improve performance and allocate resources to our business segments. While management considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure of comparative operating performance, it should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, net income and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Not all companies calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner and the measure, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies.\nThe following table includes the reconciliation of our consolidated U.S. GAAP net loss to our consolidated Adjusted EBITDA:\nYears Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands)\n2017\n2016\nNet loss\n$\n(6,126)\n$\n(21,874)\nInterest expense\n8,622\n8,400\nProvision for income tax\n1,234\n155\nDepreciation and amortization\n3,705\n2,957\nBasis-difference amortization in equity earnings of affiliate\n460\n484\nChange in fair value of stock warrants and other\nderivatives\n3,922\n4,573\nStock-based compensation\n1,841\n1,010\nRestructuring\n249\n5,938\nLoss from discontinued operations\n—\n3,277\nForeign currency exchange loss on intercompany accounts\n(591)\n1,487\nNon-cash royalty expense\n3,234\n6,681\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n16,550\n$\n13,088\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rlj-entertainment-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-financial-results-300614333.html\nSOURCE RLJ Entertainment, Inc.",
