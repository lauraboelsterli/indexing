REUTERS/Jason Lee/File Photo Lego said sales fell 8 percent last year to 35 billion Danish crowns (4.2 billion pounds), while profit before tax fell 18 percent to 10.2 billion crowns. “During 2017, revenue in our established markets declined, primarily due to actions we took to clean up inventories. This decline impacted our operating profits,” Chief Executive Niels B. Christiansen said in a statement. Reporting by Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen, editing by Louise Heavens",
