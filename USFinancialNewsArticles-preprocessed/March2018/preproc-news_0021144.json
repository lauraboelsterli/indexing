    "text": "TAMPA, Fla., March 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HCI Group, Inc. (NYSE:HCI), a holding company primarily engaged in homeowners insurance, with additional operations in reinsurance, real estate and information technology, reported results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 - Financial Results\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $12.1 million or $1.14 diluted earnings per share compared with $4.6 million or $0.47 diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGross premiums earned totaled $87.9 million compared with $92.4 million in the same period in 2016. The decrease in 2017 was attributable primarily to policy attrition. Gross premiums written were $46.6 million compared with $58.9 million in the same quarter in 2016 due primarily to a smaller number of policies assumed from Citizens Property Insurance Corporation in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with the fourth quarter of 2016.\nPremiums ceded increased to $32.1 million or 36.5% of gross premiums earned from $29.1 million or 31.4% of gross premiums earned in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to the adjustment to benefits and deferred reinsurance premiums related to retrospective provisions under certain reinsurance contracts.\nNet premiums earned (defined as gross premiums earned less premiums ceded to reinsurance) were $55.8 million compared with $63.4 million in the same period in 2016.\nNet premiums written (defined as gross premiums written less premiums ceded to reinsurance) were $14.5 million compared with $29.8 million in the same period in 2016.\nInvestment related income was $5.0 million compared with $4.8 million in the same period in 2016. Additionally, the company recognized net non-cash charges of $0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to declines in the fair value of securities determined to be other than temporary.\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses were $23.2 million compared with $45.4 million in the same period in 2016. The decrease was due to the impact of Hurricane Matthew and reserve strengthening in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nInterest expense was $4.4 million compared with $3.0 million in the same period in 2016. The increase resulted from the issuance of $143.75 million of 4.25% convertible senior notes in March 2017, offset in part by the redemption of the company’s 8% senior notes in the amount of $40.25 million in April 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 - Financial Ratios\nThe loss ratio (defined as losses and loss adjustment expenses related to net premiums earned) for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 41.6% compared with 71.7% for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe expense ratio (defined as underwriting expenses, general and administrative personnel expenses, interest expenses, and other operating expenses related to net premiums earned) was 38.5% compared with 33.2% in the same prior year period.\nExpressed as a total of all expenses related to net premiums earned, the combined loss and expense ratio was 80.1% compared with 104.9% in the same prior year period.\nFull Year 2017 - Financial Results\nNet loss for the year 2017 totaled $6.9 million or $0.75 diluted loss per common share compared with net income of $29.0 million or $2.92 diluted earnings per common share for 2016. The decline was primarily attributable to losses and loss adjustment expenses from Hurricane Irma, a decrease in gross premiums earned and an increase in interest expense resulting from the issuance of long-term debt in March 2017. These factors contributed to $15.6 million pre-tax operating losses in 2017 which resulted in $8.7 million of recognized income tax benefit, which included net positive tax effects of approximately $1.4 million due to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nGross premiums earned totaled $358.3 million compared with $378.7 million in 2016. The decrease in 2017 was primarily attributable to policy attrition. Gross premiums written were $347.4 million compared with $367.2 million in the same twelve-month period of 2016.\nPremiums ceded were $133.6 million or 37.3% of gross premiums earned compared with $135.1 million or 35.7% of gross premiums earned during 2016. The percentage increase was primarily attributable to adjustments related to retrospective provisions under certain reinsurance contracts due to losses incurred by Hurricane Irma.\nNet premiums earned decreased to $224.6 million from $243.6 million in 2016. Net premiums written were $213.8 million compared with $232.1 million in 2016.\nInvestment related income was $15.9 million compared with $11.7 million in 2016. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to increased income from limited partnership investments and greater realized net gains from the sale of securities. Additionally, the company recognized net non-cash charges of $1.5 million in 2017 and $2.5 million in 2016 due to declines in the fair value of securities determined to be other than temporary.\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses for 2017 and 2016 were $165.6 million and $124.7 million, respectively. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2017 included $54 million of estimated net losses related to Hurricane Irma, an increase of $2.5 million to the company’s estimate of Hurricane Matthew losses, and reserve strengthening for prior years. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2016 were also impacted by weather related events.\nPolicy acquisition and other underwriting expenses were $39.7 million compared with $42.6 million for 2016.\nGeneral and administrative personnel expenses were $25.1 million compared with $26.2 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to capitalized payroll costs related to a software development project that began in the fourth quarter of 2016 and lower cash bonuses for senior management.\nBook value per share, defined as shareholders’ equity divided by common shares outstanding, was $22.14 at December 31, 2017 compared with $25.23 at December 31, 2016.\nFull Year 2017 - Financial Ratios\nThe loss ratio was 73.7% compared with 51.2% in 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to losses related to Hurricane Irma combined with the decrease in net premiums earned in 2017.\nThe expense ratio was 42% compared with 38.1% in 2016. The increase in 2017 was primarily attributable to the reduction in 2017 in net premiums earned. Expressed as a total of all expenses related to net premiums earned, the combined loss and expense ratio to net premiums earned was 115.8% compared with 89.3% in 2016.\nDue to the impact that reinsurance costs have on net premiums earned from period to period, management believes the combined ratio measured to gross premiums earned is more relevant in assessing overall performance. The combined ratio to gross premiums earned for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 72.6% compared with 57.5% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nManagement Commentary\n“After Hurricane Irma we are back to earning profits and increasing book value,” said Paresh Patel, HCI’s chairman and chief executive officer. “Our enterprise continues to return value to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.”\nConference Call\nHCI Group will hold a conference call later today, March 6, 2018, to discuss these financial results.
