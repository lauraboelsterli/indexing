    "text": "March 1, 2018 / 6:00 AM / Updated 39 minutes ago EU clears Essilor's 48 billion euro merger with Luxottica Matthias Blamont 3 Min Read PARIS (Reuters) - The European Commission approved a 48 billion euro ($58 billion) merger of Luxottica ( LUX.MI ) and Essilor ( ESSI.PA ) without conditions on Thursday, lifting shares in both. The proposed tie-up between the Italian company, which owns trademarks like Ray-Ban and Oakley, and the French eyewear specialist, which sells lenses brand Varilux, is aimed at helping the businesses take advantage of expected strong demand for prescription spectacles and sunglasses. “We’ve received feedback from nearly 4,000 opticians in a market test in Europe that Essilor and Luxottica would not gain market power to harm competition,” EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. Essilor shares jumped 5 percent, the announcement coming hours after the world’s largest maker of ophthalmic lenses reported higher sales but weaker profit margins. The EU approval means Essilor and Luxottica are now waiting for the go-ahead from regulators in the United States and China. Rivals and opticians have voiced concern that the merged entity might persuade opticians to buy eye wear and lenses as a competitive package. Speaking earlier about progress toward completing the merger, Essilor’s Chief Operating Officer Laurent Vacherot said: “We are serene,” adding he expected a green light in the U.S. in the coming weeks. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2018. FILE PHOTO: Lens producers Essilor's logo is seen in an optician shop in Paris, France, March 15, 2016. REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo COSTS IN THE WAY OF PROFIT GROWTH Announcing its annual results, Essilor said it targeted revenue growth of around 4 percent in 2018. Revenues rose 3.1 percent on a like-for-like basis to 7.5 billion euros last year, partly helped by higher sales in North America. Higher costs meant a measure of profitability stripping out the cost of sales and operating expenses, was 18.2 percent of revenue in 2017 and is forecast at a minimum of 18.3 percent in 2018. That is down from 18.6 percent in 2016. The company gave few further details. “Key triggers for both companies’ share prices remain deal clearance and news flow from antitrust authorities,” Raymond James analysts said in briefing note. “The full-year 2018 outlook is slightly below our forecasts.” Investors are waiting for news on the management structure of the company that will arise from the merger. Essilor Chief Executive Hubert Sagnieres, who is set to share powers with Luxottica’s chairman Leonardo Del Vecchio for an initial three years timeframe, said in December that the merged group would appoint a new CEO. Vacherot said Essilor would keep pursuing its long-running strategy of bolt-on acquisitions in 2018, particularly in China and India. Luxottica, which has been undergoing a restructuring since 2014, forecast on Monday steady growth in sales and profits this year. Its shares rose 4 percent.
