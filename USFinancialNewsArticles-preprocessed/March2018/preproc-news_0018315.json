David brings an impressive leadership reputation, a wealth of sales and satellite industry experience, and a lifelong passion for making ubiquitous connectivity a reality,” said Neville Meijers, Chief Commercial Officer and Executive Vice President. “We are confident that David is the right person to lead our global sales strategy and to help us realize our vision of making mobile connectivity accessible to every business in the world, no matter where they are located and whether they require fixed or mobile solutions.”\nHarrower has extensive experience leading, innovating, and building business communications and connectivity on a global scale, including having guided multiple companies to successful growth. He comes to Kymeta most recently from VT iDirect, where as Vice President, International Sales and Business Development, he developed quick-growth sales strategies that led to rapid global business expansion.

Prior to VT iDirect, Harrower served as Director, Russia, CIS, CEE, for Comtech, where he developed strategy for sales teams working in Eastern Europe.\n“I cannot imagine a more exciting or important time to join the team at Kymeta. With solutions that touch every corner of the world, and provide the answer to communications needs that have been unanswered for decades, Kymeta is well-positioned to provide seamless, always-on connectivity to the world in ways that most people have never considered,” said Harrower. “I have spent much of my career in communications, providing solutions that make it easier to connect and remain connected. I look forward to working with this great team to make ubiquitous, reliable connectivity the norm.”\nAbout Kymeta\nThe world’s demand for ubiquitous mobile connectivity is irrefutable.
