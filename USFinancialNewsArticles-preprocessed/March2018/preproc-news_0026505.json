    "text": "MILWAUKEE, March 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- U.S. employer hiring confidence is staying strong in Q2 2018 as one in five plan to grow their workforce in the three months ahead. The seasonally adjusted Net Employment Outlook for Q2 2018 is +18%, according to the latest ManpowerGroup (NYSE: MAN) Employment Outlook Survey of more than 11,500 U.S. employers.\nOrganizations are planning to add staff across all 13 industry sectors in Q2 2018. Employers report the strongest hiring intentions in Leisure & Hospitality (+28%) as the economy picks up. Strong Outlooks for Professional & Business Services (+24%) and Wholesale & Retail Trade (+23%) point to demand-driven growth in line with increased wages. Employers in Wholesale & Retail Trade report some of the most optimistic Outlooks in more than 16 years as online retail continues to grow and the increase in distribution workers is expected to rise. The weakest Outlooks are reported in Mining (+15%), Government Information (+14%) and Nondurable Goods Manufacturing (+12%).\n\"We're seeing solid, demand-fueled growth across the U.S. as the economy continues to strengthen and the labor market tightens at pace,\" said Becky Frankiewicz, president of ManpowerGroup North America. \"The competition for skilled talent is set to heat up and a just-in-time approach isn't always getting employers the skills they need when they need them. Now is the time to invest in people by upskilling America's workers. We should also seek untapped talent sources with adjacent skillsets that can adapt to fill in-demand positions. At ManpowerGroup we accelerate people's careers offering skills development to help people access in-demand opportunities. Our MyPath™ offering has provided 120,000 U.S. associates with advice and opportunities to increase their skills and earnings. Upskilling the workforce and building employability will be the solution to the Skills Revolution.\"\nView complete Q2 2018 survey results for the U.S: www.manpowergroup.us/meos .\nQuarter\nIncrease\nStaff Levels\nDecrease\nStaff Levels\nMaintain\nStaff Levels\nDon't\nKnow*\nNet Employment Outlook\n(seasonalized*)\nQ2 2018\n(current\nquarter)\n23%\n3%\n73%\n1%\n+18%\nQ1 2018\n(prior\nquarter)\n21%\n5%\n71%\n3%\n+19%\nQ2 2017\n(one\nyear\nago)\n22%\n3%\n73%\n2%\n+17%\nU.S. Hiring Plans by Regions, Industry Sectors and Metro Areas/States\nNationwide, employers in all 13 industry sectors expect to add staff in Q2 2018.
