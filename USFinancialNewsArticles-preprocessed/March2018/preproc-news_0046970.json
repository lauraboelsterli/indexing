    "text": "CHELMSFORD, Mass., March 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Brooks Automation, Inc. (Nasdaq: BRKS) announced today that it has executed a definitive agreement to acquire Tec-Sem Group AG, a provider of semiconductor fab automation equipment with a focus on reticle management. Tec-Sem is headquartered in Tӓgerwilen, Switzerland with a sales and service team supporting customers worldwide. The total cash purchase price of the acquisition will be approximately $16 million, subject to customary working capital and other adjustments. The acquisition is expected to close in early April upon satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nTec-Sem has been selling and supporting innovative automation solutions for the semiconductor industry for more than 30 years. Tec-Sem is a leading provider of reticle management solutions, with a bare reticle stocker system that can store up to 2,880 reticles and provide inspection and pod transfer capabilities. The company's reticle stockers are used by leading chip manufacturers worldwide for contaminant-free storage of reticles, which are the masks that contain the patterns that are ultimately transferred to the wafer surface.\n\"Tec-Sem is a great fit for our contamination control solutions,\" commented Dave Jarzynka, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Brooks Semiconductor Solutions Group. \"Most of Tec-Sem's revenue is derived from large IC manufacturers, further strengthening our relationships with this important customer base.\"\nTec-Sem generated approximately $14 million of revenue in the calendar year ended December 31, 2017. Management expects the acquisition will become accretive to Brooks' non-GAAP earnings within the current fiscal year. At the anticipated April closing Brooks will acquire approximately 93% of Tec-Sem's outstanding capital stock. The remaining minority interest will be acquired in due course upon completion of subsequent procedural steps.\nAbout Brooks Automation, Inc.\nBrooks is a leading worldwide provider of automation and cryogenic solutions for multiple markets including semiconductor manufacturing and life sciences.
