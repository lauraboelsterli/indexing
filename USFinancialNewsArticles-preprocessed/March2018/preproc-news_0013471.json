    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CEMATRIX Corporation (TSXV:CVX) (the “ Corporation ” or the “ Company ” or “ CEMATRIX ”) announces the release of its consolidated financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n“For the year the Company’s infrastructure sales continued to grow, but this sales growth was not sufficient to offset the 98% decline in sales from its oil and gas construction market,” stated Jeff Kendrick, President and CEO of CEMATRIX. “This decrease in overall sales for the year resulted in an increased loss for the year. However this trend is reversing and it is expected that the continued growth in infrastructure sales will return the Company to profitability. This is supported by the contracted and verbally awarded sales in place to date for 2018, which now exceeds $11.5 million, $6.2 million of which is contracted.”\nEven though infrastructure sales were slower than anticipated, the Company’s sales pipeline continued to grow, and includes several projects which individually exceed $10 million. This sales pipeline growth is due to the continued acceptance of the Company’s products across Canada and into the United States, which is largely due to the continued education of the engineering world, the success of projects completed since the Company’s inception and the Company’s continued focus on research and development. This research and development includes the introduction of an even lighter, stronger product to support its major applications including bridge abutments, MSE panel backfill and roads.\nCEMATRIX’s main goal for 2018 is to scale up its infrastructure sales, which includes the hiring of additional sales staff and now includes the planned acquisition of a profitable cellular concrete supplier in the United States. On February 26, 2018 the Company announced that it had signed a binding letter of intent (“LOI”) to acquire the shares of MixOnSite USA, Inc. (“MOS”) with the intent that a definitive agreement of purchase and sale will be put in place on or before April 30, 2018. The LOI is subject to a number of conditions on closing as outlined in the news release dated February 26, 2018.\nThe proposed MOS acquisition will position CEMATRIX for further growth in the United States and will provide both trained operation staff and additional equipment to meet the growing North American demand for cellular concrete. Each company has technologies that can make both companies stronger players in their respective markets and their combined sales will provide the growing working capital to support this expected growth. CEMATRIX has over $11.5 million of contracted and verbally awarded projects scheduled for 2018. When combined with MOS contracted and verbally awarded projects, the number exceeds $26 million. Both companies expect that these 2018 forecast numbers will continue to grow.\nSelected financial information for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nThree Months ended December 31 Year ended December 31 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change Revenue $ 548,784 $ 1,167,827 $ (619,043 ) $ 7,713,906 $ 9,598,861 $ (1,884,955 ) Gross margin (327,350 ) (55,409 ) (271,941 ) 847,803 1,316,376 (468,573 ) Operating expenses (614,667 ) (511,633 ) (103,034 ) (2,231,376 ) (2,283,876 ) 52,500 Operating loss (942,017 ) (567,042 ) (374,975 ) (1,383,573 ) (967,500 ) (416,073 ) Non-cash stock based compensation (5,534 ) (32,667 ) 27,133 6,737 (142,256 ) 148,993 Finance costs (51,727 ) (41,036 ) (10,691 ) (207,490 ) (199,936 ) (7,554 ) Other income (expenses) 2,524 (70,100 ) 72,624 45,572 (18,617 ) 64,189 (Loss) before income taxes (996,754 ) (710,845 ) (285,909 ) (1,538,754 ) (1,328,309 ) (210,445 ) Income taxes 221,350 159,274 62,076 353,553 246,860 106,693 Loss attributable to common shareholders (775,404 ) (551,571 ) (223,823 ) (1,185,201 ) (1,081,449 ) $ (103,752 ) Unrealized foreign exchange gain (loss) on translation of foreign subsidiary 7,465 17,166 (9,701 ) 4,658 (16,143 ) 20,801 Comprehensive loss $ (767,939 ) $ (534,405 ) $ (233,534 ) $ (1,180,543 ) $ (1,097,592 ) $ (82,951 ) Loss per common share (diluted) $ (0.022 ) $ (0.016 ) $ (0.007 ) $ (0.034 ) $ (0.031 ) $ (0.003 ) This press release should be read in conjunction with the Corporation’s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Management Discussion and Analysis for the year both of which can be found on SEDAR.\nCEMATRIX is an Alberta corporation with its head offices in Calgary, Alberta.
