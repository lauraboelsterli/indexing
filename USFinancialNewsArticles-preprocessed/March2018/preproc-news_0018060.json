    "text": "BOCA RATON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cogint, Inc. (NASDAQ: COGT) announced today that its Board of Directors has established March 19, 2018 as the record date (the “Record Date”) and March 26, 2018 as the distribution date (“Distribution Date”) for its previously announced spin-off of its data and analytics subsidiary, Red Violet, Inc. (“Red Violet”).\nThe spin-off will occur by way of a dividend of one share of Red Violet common stock for every six shares of cogint common stock held on the Record Date. Following the Distribution Date, Red Violet will be an independent, publicly-traded company listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol “RDVT.” cogint common stock will continue to trade on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol “COGT.”\nBefore the Distribution Date, cogint will distribute all of the outstanding shares of Red Violet common stock to the distribution agent for distribution to cogint shareholders and certain warrant holders. Upon the Distribution Date, cogint, with the assistance of the distribution agent, will electronically issue shares of Red Violet common stock to shareholders of cogint. cogint shareholders are not required to take any action to receive Red Violet common stock and they will not be required to surrender or exchange their cogint common stock for Red Violet shares.\nFractional shares of Red Violet common stock will not be distributed, and instead cogint shareholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares they would otherwise be entitled to receive in the distribution. Recipients of cash in lieu of fractional shares will not be entitled to any interest on the amounts paid in lieu of fractional shares.\nRed Violet common stock will trade on a “when issued” basis (identified by the letter “v” at the end of the trading symbol - RDVTV) beginning one trading day before the Record Date (on March 16, 2018) and continuing through the Distribution Date. cogint common stock will continue to trade “regular way,” reflecting the combined value of cogint and Red Violet until the Distribution Date and also on a “when issued” basis (identified by the letter “v” at the end of the ticker symbol – COGTV) reflecting the value of cogint as a standalone entity through the Distribution Date. “Regular way” trading in Red Violet common stock will begin on the first trading day after the Distribution Date.\nAbout cogint™\nAt cogint, we believe that time is your most valuable asset.
