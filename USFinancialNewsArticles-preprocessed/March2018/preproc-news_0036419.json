FILE PHOTO - Soccer Football - Serie A - Juventus vs Udinese Calcio - Allianz Stadium, Turin, Italy - March 11, 2018 Juventus’ Giorgio Chiellini reacts REUTERS/Massimo Pinca The Azzurri play Argentina in Manchester on March 23 and England at Wembley four days later under the leadership of interim coach Luigi Di Biagio, who replaced Gian Piero Ventura in November after Italy failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1958. The 33-year-old Chiellini, capped 96 times by Italy, picked up the injury in Juve’s 0-0 draw at Spal on Saturday. The Turin club said the injury would be evaluated over the next two days. Juve’s next match is against AC Milan on March 31, followed by the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final against Real Madrid on April 3.
