To learn more visit www.b-r-r.com .\nDisclosure\nThe Forbes ranking of Best-In-State Wealth Advisors, developed by SHOOK Research, is based on an algorithm of qualitative criteria, mostly gained through telephone and in-person due diligence interviews, and quantitative data. Those advisors that are considered have a minimum of seven years experience, and the algorithm weighs factors like revenue trends, assets under management, compliance records, industry experience and those that encompass best practices in their practices and approach to working with clients. Portfolio performance is not a criteria due to varying client objectives and lack of audited data. Neither Forbes or SHOOK receive a fee in exchange for rankings.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180308006119/en/\nBudros, Ruhlin & Roe, Inc.\nKate Oster, +1 614-481-6900\nSource: Budros, Ruhlin & Roe, Inc.",
