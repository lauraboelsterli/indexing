    "text": "Joe Skipper | Reuters Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX and Tesla. \nElon Musk took to Twitter Friday with a series of tweets throwing shade at Facebook, saying he would delete both the SpaceX and Tesla pages on the social media behemoth. \nAs of Friday at 1 p.m. EST, both the SpaceX and Tesla Facebooks were unreachable. However neither company responded to CNBC Make It's request for comment by the time this story was published. \nThe twitter rant started with Musk, CEO of both Tesla and SpaceX, making fun of home-speaker maker Sonos for pulling its ads from Facebook and Instagram for a week.",
