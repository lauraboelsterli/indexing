    "text": "ONEONTA, Ala, March 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Otelco Inc. (NASDAQ:OTEL), a wireline telecommunications services provider in Alabama, Maine, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia today announced results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. Key highlights for Otelco include:\nTotal revenues of $16.8 million for fourth quarter 2017 and $68.5 million for 2017. Operating income of $4.5 million for fourth quarter 2017 and $19.6 million for 2017. Net income of $7.4 million for fourth quarter 2017 and $12.1 million for 2017. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below) of $6.5 million for fourth quarter 2017 and $27.6 million for 2017.\nRevenue and operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2017, were basically flat when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016, declining 0.2% and 1.4% respectively. “In an industry seeing declines in residential subscribers every measurement period, it is exciting to be able to hold our revenue and operating margins constant during fourth quarter,” announced Rob Souza, President and CEO of Otelco. “The ACAM funding continues to help offset local service revenue declines. Our team is focused on meeting our customers' needs in an efficient manner, while we expand the fiber content of our network.”\nIn the first year of its ten-year ACAM funding, Otelco placed approximately 81 miles of fiber passing over 1,900 locations and reaching 7.5% of its eligible ACAM locations. Otelco now has approximately 1,700 fiber route miles in its network. Including the ACAM fiber, the Company invested $2.6 million in the business in fourth quarter 2017 and over $8.5 million during the full year 2017 for an increase of $1.6 million when compared to its 2016 investment. Cash declined to $3.6 million from $10.5 million at the end of 2016, reflecting the increased capital investment, debt reduction of over $11.9 million and the fees associated with terminating the existing credit facilities and securing the new loan. The Company’s ratio of debt, net of cash, to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined below), was 2.98 at December 31, 2017.\nTwo events that occurred in fourth quarter 2017 should have a positive impact on Otelco’s results, both in the current quarter and for years to come. As announced in November 2017, the Company refinanced its credit facilities with a new $92 million, five-year credit facility from a consortium of banks led by CoBank, ACB. The facility includes a $5.0 million revolver which remains undrawn. This facility will significantly lower interest costs compared to the Company’s former facilities while scheduled principal payments under the new facility will reduce Otelco’s debt by over 25% over the term of the loan. The agreement adversely affected fourth quarter 2017 net income by $2.2 million in one-time termination fees associated with replacing the existing credit facilities.\nThe Tax Cut and Jobs Act, enacted in December 2017, affects Otelco’s taxes in 2017, as well as future tax years. Bonus depreciation was increased from 50% to 100%, beginning in 2017, with the Company realizing a benefit of over $0.6 million in fourth quarter 2017. The reduced maximum tax rate has also lowered the Company’s deferred tax liabilities and is reflected in an income tax benefit, raising net income for the quarter and year. “We recently announced to our employees that everyone would be receiving a special bonus of $500,” commented Rob Souza, President and CEO of Otelco. “Coupled with the lower tax withholding rate that most employees should experience, everyone should start 2018 with more take home pay.\n“Early in 2017, we announced that the Company had selected a partner to consolidate all of its billing and operational systems on one platform,” continued Souza. “During fourth quarter, we developed all of the operational data needed to build the new system and have continued making decisions necessary to consolidate all of our disparate processes into the new system. Training on the new systems is involving every employee. Our first carrier bills under the new system are going out this week, with end-user customer billing to follow in second quarter. As we move to a Company-wide operational system, we will brand all of our services as Otelco. In New England, OTT Communications will become Otelco. The new logo is already at the top of our updated web site – www.Otelco.com .”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Summary (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) (Unaudited) Three Months Ended December 31, Change 2017 2016 Amount Percent Revenues $ 16,793 $ 16,833 $ (40 ) (0.2 ) % Operating income $ 4,544 $ 4,607 $ (63 ) (1.4 ) % Interest expense $ (5,500 ) $ (2,703 ) $ 2,797 103.5 % Net income available to stockholders $ 7,382 $ 946 $ 6,436 680.3 % Basic net income per share $ 2.21 $ 0.29 $ 1.92 662.1 % Diluted net income per share $ 2.14 $ 0.27 $ 1.87 692.6 % Consolidated EBITDA (a) $ 6,504 $ 6,703 $ (199 ) (3.0 ) % Capital expenditures $ 2,560 $ 2,770 $ (210 ) (7.6 ) % Twelve Months Ended December 31, Change 2017 2016 Amount Percent Revenues $ 68,526 $ 68,944 $ (418 ) (0.6 ) % Operating income $ 19,607 $ 18,813 $ 794 4.2 % Interest expense $ (13,249 ) $ (10,634 ) $ 2,615 24.6 % Net income available to stockholders $ 12,115 $ 5,146 $ 6,969 135.4 % Basic net income per share $ 3.62 $ 1.57 $ 2.05 130.6 % Diluted net income per share $ 3.52 $ 1.51 $ 2.01 133.1 % Consolidated EBITDA (a) $ 27,640 $ 28,078 $ (438 ) (1.6 ) % Capital expenditures $ 8,511 $ 6,880 $ 1,631 23.7 % Reconciliation of Consolidate d EBITDA to Net Income Three Months Ended December 31, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income $ 7,382 $ 946 $ 12,115 $ 5,146 Add: Depreciation 1,776 1,809 7,001 7,137 Interest expense less interest income 1,605 2,390 8,426 9,236 Interest expense - amortize loan cost 3,896 314 4,823 1,397 Debt prepayment penalty fees 2,228 - 2,303 - Income tax (benefit) expense (10,565 ) 958 (7,856 ) 3,658 Amortization - intangibles 85 142 376 885 Stock-based compensation 71 104 308 415 Loan fees 26 40 144 204 Consolidated EBITDA (a) $ 6,504 $ 6,703 $ 27,640 $ 28,078 (a) Consolidated EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income plus consolidated net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, income taxes and certain other fees, expenses and non-cash charges reducing consolidated net income. Consolidated EBITDA is a supplemental measure of the Company’s performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Consolidated EBITDA corresponds to the definition of Consolidated EBITDA in the Company’s credit facility. The lender under the Company’s credit facility utilizes this measure to determine compliance with credit facility requirements. The Company uses Consolidated EBITDA as an operational performance measurement to focus attention on the operational generation of cash, which is used for reinvestment into the business; to repay its debt and to pay interest on its debt; to pay income taxes; and for other corporate requirements. The Company reports Consolidated EBITDA to allow current and potential investors to understand this performance metric and because the Company believes that it provides current and potential investors with helpful information with respect to the Company’s operating performance. However, Consolidated EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s presentation of Consolidated EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nOtelco Inc. - Key Operating Statistics (unaudited) Quarterly Annual December 31, September 30, December 31, % Change from % Change from 2016 2017 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Business/Enterprise CLEC\nVoice lines 17,034 16,491 16,239 (1.5 ) % (4.7 ) % HPBX seats 11,487 11,410 11,338 (0.6 ) % (1.3 ) % Data lines 3,655 3,342 3,359 0.5 % (8.1 ) % Wholesale network lines 2,570 2,548 2,417 (5.1 ) % (6.0 ) % RLEC\nVoice lines 16,621 15,530 15,400 (0.8 ) % (7.3 ) % Data lines 1,634 1,621 1,602 (1.2 ) % (2.0 ) % Access line equivalents (1)\n53,001 50,942 50,355 (1.2 ) % (5.0 ) % Residential CLEC\nVoice lines 199 638 628 (1.6 ) % 215.6 % Data lines 2,291 2,851 2,815 (1.3 ) % 22.9 % RLEC\nVoice lines 20,978 19,659 19,147 (2.6 ) % (8.7 ) % Data lines 19,622 19,175 18,771 (2.1 ) % (4.3 ) % Other services 3,682 3,632 3,561 (2.0 ) % (3.3 ) % Access line equivalents (1) 46,772 45,955 44,922 (2.2 ) % (4.0 ) % Otelco access line equivalents (1) 99,773 96,897 95,277 (1.7 ) % (4.5 ) % (1 ) The Company defines access line equivalents as retail and wholesale voice lines, data lines (including cable modems, digital subscriber lines, other broadband connections and dedicated data access trunks) and other services (including entertainment and security services).\nThe Company uses the ratio of debt, net of cash, to Consolidated EBITDA for the last twelve months as an operational performance measurement. Such ratio is a supplemental measure of the Company’s performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. The Company reports such ratio to allow current and potential investors to understand this performance metric. The Company also believes that it provides current and potential investors with helpful information with respect to the Company’s operating performance, including the Company’s ability to generate earnings sufficient to service its debt, and enhances understanding of the Company’s financial performance and highlight operational trends. However, such ratio should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s presentation of such ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled ratios used by other companies. The table below provides the calculation of such ratio as of December 31, 2017.\nRatio of debt, net of cash, to Consolidated EDITDA as of December 31, 2017 ($000) unaudited Notes payable $ 83,949 Debt issuance costs 1,963 Notes outstanding 85,912 Less cash (3,570 ) Notes outstanding, net of cash $ 82,342 Consolidated EBITDA for the last twelve months $ 27,640 Total leverage ratio, net of cash 2.98 FINANCIAL DISCUSSION FOR FOURTH QUARTER 2017:\nRevenues\nTotal revenues decreased 0.2% in the three months ended December 31, 2017, to slightly less than $16.8 million from slightly more than $16.8 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in residential RLEC access line equivalents and traditional access revenue affected by the FCC’s inter-carrier compensation reform order (the “FCC’s order”) were offset by increases associated with the FCC’s ACAM and Connect America Fund (“CAF”) programs. The table below provides the components of the Company’s revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period of 2016.\nThree Months Ended December 31, Change 2017 2016 Amount Percent (unaudited, dollars in thousands) Local services $ 5,445 $ 5,741 $ (296 ) (5.2 ) % Network access 5,342 5,031 311 6.2 % Internet 3,930 3,924 6 0.2 % Transport services 1,134 1,168 (34 ) (2.9 ) % Video and security 735 725 10 1.4 % Managed services 207 244 (37 ) (15.2 ) % Total $ 16,793 $ 16,833 $ (40 ) (0.2 ) % Local services revenue decreased 5.2% in the three months ended December 31, 2017, to $5.4 million from $5.7 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decline in RLEC residential voice access lines and the impact of the FCC’s order, which reduced or eliminated intrastate and local cellular revenue, accounted for a decrease of $0.2 million. A portion of the RLEC decrease is recovered through the CAF, which is categorized as interstate access revenue. The decline in long distance, Hosted PBX equipment sales and directory revenue accounted for a decrease of $0.2 million. Wholesale services in a municipality in Massachusetts provided an increase of $0.1 million. Network access revenue increased 6.2% in the three months ended December 31, 2017, to $5.3 million from $5.0 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016. A $2.0 million increase in the CAF, ACAM and transition payments was partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in switched and special access and a $0.2 million decrease in end user-based fees. Internet revenue was unchanged at $3.9 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017, and three months ended December 31, 2016. Increased speed and additional data customers in a municipality in Massachusetts were offset by the reduction in residential RLEC customers. Transport services revenue decreased 2.9% in the three months ended December 31, 2017, to $1.1 million from $1.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016, reflecting wide area network market pricing, partially offset by an increase in wholesale transport services. Video and security revenue was unchanged at $0.7 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017, and the three months ended December 31, 2016, reflecting increases in IPTV and security revenue, offset by decreases in basic cable. Managed services revenue decreased 15.2% in the three months ended December 31, 2017, over the comparable period in 2016 to remain at just over $0.2 million, reflecting a decrease in professional services revenue.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses in the three months ended December 31, 2017, increased 0.1% to remain at $12.2 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Cost of services increased 0.2% to remain at $7.9 million in both the three months ended December 31, 2017, and the three months ended December 31, 2016. Cable and internet, pole rental and network operations expense each increased $0.1 million while access and toll expense decreased $0.2 million and customer service and sales expense decreased $0.1 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 4.1% to $2.5 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017, from $2.4 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase was attributable to $0.1 million in executive compensation expense associated with the use of a cash bonus plan for 2017 instead of the stock bonus plan used in 2016. Depreciation and amortization decreased 4.7 % in the three months ended December 31, 2017, to $1.9 million from $2.0 million in three months ended December 31, 2016. The amortization of other intangible assets and the telephone plant adjustment accounted for the decrease.\nOperating Income\nOperating income in the three months ended December 31, 2017, decreased 1.4% to $4.5 million from $4.6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016, based on the mentioned changes in revenue and operating expenses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense in the three months ended December 31, 2017, increased 103.5% to $5.5 million from $2.7 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016. The write-off of the unamortized loan costs associated with terminating the Company’s existing credit facilities increased loan cost amortization by $3.6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase was partially offset by lower interest expense of $0.8 million under the new CoBank term loan in the final two months of the quarter for the same periods.\nLoss on Debt Prepayment Penalty\nThe Company paid $2.2 million in one-time debt prepayment penalty fees associated with replacing the Company’s credit facilities with the new CoBank term loan in the three months ended December 31, 2017. There were no comparable expenses in the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe change in the federal income tax law at the end of 2017 had a material impact on deferred income tax liabilities, producing a tax benefit of $9.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The Company experienced a net loss before taxes of $3.2 million due to accounting for the change to the new credit facility, resulting in a $1.3 million tax benefit. The $10.6 million tax benefit for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to an income tax expense of $1.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in bonus depreciation from 50% to 100% positively affected 2017 and future years, in addition to the reduction in the maximum federal tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nNet Income\nBased on the changes noted above, net income increased $6.4 million to $7.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, when compared to just under $1.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily driven by the changes in the tax law and the implementation of the new CoBank credit facility.\nConsolidated EBITDA\nBased on the changes noted above, Consolidated EBITDA decreased $0.2 million to $6.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, when compared to $6.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Stock based compensation and other excluded expenses are added back in the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA. Consolidated EBITDA decreased $0.4 million to just over $27.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, when compared to just under $28.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. See financial tables for a reconciliation of Consolidated EBITDA to net income.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $3.6 million compared to $10.5 million at the end of 2016. During fourth quarter 2017, the Company entered into a new $92.0 million credit facility with CoBank which included an undrawn $5.0 million revolver, using the funds to replace its existing credit facilities. A $1.1 million principal payment at the end of December 2017 reduced the outstanding balance to $85.9 million. The Company’s ratio of debt, net of cash, to Consolidated EBITDA for the last twelve months was 2.98 at December 31, 2017.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures were $2.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2.8 million in the same period in 2016. Capital expenditures were $8.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $6.9 million in 2016.\nFourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call\nOtelco has scheduled a conference call, which will be broadcast live over the internet, on Tuesday, March 6, 2018, at 11:30 a.m. (Eastern Time).
