    "text": "U.S. News Two shot dead at Central Michigan University At least two people were shot dead in a dormintory at Central Michigan University on Friday and police were hunting for a suspect. The 19-year-old male suspect was considered \"armed and dangerous.\" Published 2 Hours Ago Reuters Google Earth There has been a report of shots fired at Campbell Hall on campus at Central Michigan University in Mt. Pleasant, Michigan on March 2, 2018. \nAt least two people were shot dead in a dormitory at Central Michigan University on Friday, and the suspect is still at large. @CMUniversity tweet \nUniversity police confirmed in a statement that the victims were not students, and believe the shooting may have escalated from a domestic incident. \nThe suspect, 19-year-old male James Eric Davis, Jr., is still at large. The campus was on lockdown as of 10:43 a.m. ET, according to Central Michigan. Davis is considered \"armed and dangerous,\" according to a tweet from the City of Mount Pleasant. \nState police officials did not immediately respond to calls seeking comment. \nThe university, located about 125 miles (200 km) northwest of Detroit, wrote on Twitter at 9:30 a.m. on Friday that there were reports of shots fired at Campbell Hall. \nThe incident came about two weeks after 17 students and educators were killed at a Florida high school. \nA university police official confirmed the department was monitoring the situation but declined to provide additional details. \nThe United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said on Twitter it was sending special agents to assist. \nCentral Michigan University is a four-year, public institution with more than 23,000 students enrolled, according to the college's website. \n--CNBC's Chloe Aiello contributed to this report",
