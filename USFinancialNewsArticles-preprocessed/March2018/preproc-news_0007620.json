    "text": "Olympic gold medalist Aly Raisman is suing the U.S. Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics for their response to a sexual abuse scandal involving former team doctor Larry Nassar, according to multiple reports.\n\"My highest priority has been to push for change, so future generations of athletes will be safer,\" Raisman said in a statement released to multiple media outlets. \"It has become painfully clear that these organizations have no intention of properly addressing this problem.\nMore from USA Today: \nColorado child sex offender sentenced to 300 years goes free \nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle invite 2,600 members of the public to their wedding \nTrump rips 'Alex Baldwin' on Twitter, says 'terrible impersonation' was 'agony' to watch \n\"After all this time, they remain unwilling to conduct a full investigation, and without a solid understanding of how this happened, it is delusional to think sufficient changes can be implemented. Meanwhile, thousands of young athletes continue to train and compete every day in this same broken system.\n\"I refuse to wait any longer for these organizations to do the right thing. It is my hope that the legal process will hold them accountable and enable the change that is so desperately needed.\"\nThe lawsuit alleges that the USOC, \"at the highest levels of its organization,\" was aware of Nassar's abuse and harassment of female gymnasts in his role as team doctor, according to ESPN.\nNassar is serving a 60-year sentence at a federal prison in Tucson, Ariz ., on child pornography charges. The 54-year-old also has been sentenced to 40 to 175 years in one Michigan county and 40 to 125 years in another, both on sexual assault charges. He would serve the sentences concurrently.\nMcKayla Maroney, another member of the \"Fierce Five\" that won team gold at the 2012 London Olympics, previously filed suit against USA Gymnastics and the USOC in December, alleging that the organization paid her in an attempt to prevent her from publicly accusing Nassar of sexual abuse.",
