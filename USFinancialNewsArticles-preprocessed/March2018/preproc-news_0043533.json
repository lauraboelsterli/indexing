    "text": "NEW YORK, March 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- AllianceBernstein L.P. (AB), a leading global investment firm with $555 billion in assets under management, announced today that it recently made several senior appointments and added a team of new talent to expand the firm's digital and analytics capabilities. The positions include the firm's first-ever leadership roles dedicated to digital transformation, and a dozen new hires in UX design, website development, email marketing and data analytics, among other roles, across its global regional offices.\n\"AB is committed to leveraging digital and data sources to uncover valuable insights that can lead us to better business practices,\" said Robert Keith, Head of the Global Client Group at AB. \"We're pleased to bring on a deep bench of industry-leading talent, and are confident in their abilities to help evolve our business, and deliver better customer experience and outcomes for our clients.\"\nThe three senior appointments include: Renee Anderson, an AB veteran of more than a decade, who was internally promoted to Senior Vice President (SVP) of Digital Transformation within the Office of the CEO. In this newly created position, Anderson will lead efforts to drive thought leadership around the fintech ecosystem by identifying and assessing existing and emerging digital business capabilities external to AB. Prior, she served as SVP and Head of Private Client IT & Operations for AB's private wealth business, where she drove digital capabilities including website and mobile, and improved IT infrastructure and operational processes.\nKoley Corte recently joined AB as SVP and Global Head of Business Transformation in the Client Group, where she is responsible for leading the development and delivery of top and bottom line growth strategies, leveraging digital and data. Key areas of opportunity that Corte is focused on include sales enablement, robotics and automation, ease of doing business and development of new channels and commercial opportunities. Before AB, Corte held progressive leadership roles in digital, marketing and strategy at prominent companies including TIAA, AIG, the YR/WPP Group and most recently Reed Elsevier, where she was SVP and Head of Digital and Customer Acquisition Strategies for the Americas Region of Reed Exhibitions.\nIn addition, Pinki Mehta was hired as Managing Director and Head of Digital in the Client Group, where she will lead marketing's digital transformation efforts and oversee AB's expanded digital development and program management teams across the globe. Over her 20-year career, Mehta has held many roles in the areas of digital enablement, technology and user experience. Before joining AB, she was Executive Director, Global Head of Digital Enablement at JP Morgan Chase, and prior, Vice President of Corporate Digital Strategy at Prudential Financial.\nAB is quickly gaining recognition across the industry for its innovation in digital and analytical tools. The firm recently won the coveted MicroStrategyÂ® Customer Award for Innovation for its sales intelligence mobile application, \"SIMON\". The app provides U.S. retail wholesalers with unprecedented on-demand access to sales data, marketing content, product performance and competitive market analysis. Only recently introduced, SIMON is already transforming the way AB's wholesalers manage their business, from client interactions to identifying stronger opportunities within the sales cycle.\nIn December 2017, AB introduced its first-ever, client-focused mobile app to its private wealth clients. The app enables clients to quickly check recent account activity, balances, asset allocation and returns, and offers key features such as secure, biometric authentication and the ability to connect with an advisor with one click.\n\"Traditional technology endeavors look to be more system and process-related, while success in digital means having the ability to integrate various tools and data that can lead to new products, services and innovative outcomes,\" said Keith.\nAbout AllianceBernstein\nAllianceBernstein is a leading global investment management firm that offers high-quality research and diversified investment services to institutional investors, individuals and private wealth clients in major world markets.\nAs of December 31, 2017, including both the general partnership and limited partnership interests in AB, AB Holding owned approximately 35.5% of AB and AXA, a worldwide leader in financial protection, owned an approximate 64.7% economic interest in AB.\nAdditional information about AB may be found on our website, www.alliancebernstein.com .\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ab-builds-out-global-digital-capabilities-with-series-of-new-hires-300620116.html\nSOURCE AllianceBernstein L.P.",
