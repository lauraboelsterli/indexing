    "text": "VIRGINIA BEACH, Va., March 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Divurgent, a nationally recognized healthcare IT consulting company, announced today that the company is expanding its Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Human Resource Information Systems (HRIS), and Human Capital Management (HCM) solutions with the strategic hire of Jeff Sassenscheid, Principal , who brings more than 20 years of experience in this space.\nRecently, Divurgent has experienced an increased demand in client and industry need for healthcare-focused solutions specifically around ERP, HRIS, and HCM. \"This vertical in the healthcare space is severely underserved, and the truth is that an ERP in the financial or retail space is not the same as an ERP at a complex, multi-location healthcare organization,\" said Steve Eckert, President. \"As an organization, Divurgent has the unique position of offering healthcare-focused support in these areas, understanding the holistic nature of EHR and ERP integration.\"\nSassenscheid's industry experience ranges from healthcare to life sciences to retail, and his dynamic industry experience combined with Divurgent's customizable healthcare solution focus enables Divurgent to provide clients with unmatched, comprehensive, and effective support.\n\"The challenges across industries remains the same – the optimization of time, cost, quality, and data analytics through technology; offering streamlined solutions to my clients is my passion, and I couldn't be more thrilled to bring a focused service offering to Divurgent's clients and the healthcare industry,\" said Sassenscheid.\nSassenscheid is a subject matter expert in the end-to-end processes of the business readiness, implementation, design, corporate infrastructure, staffing, costing, and optimization/reporting of technology implementation. He has led projects of global HCM suites through ERP transitions to global procurement/supply chain consolidation and is known for working diligently as the go-to partner and advisor to executive leadership from readiness to post-live support.\n\"We're thrilled to welcome Jeff to the Divurgent Team – he's bringing a truly unique perspective to these high-demand areas within healthcare and will be focused on amplifying what our team is already doing here,\" said Colin Konschak, CEO. \"We are excited to see what Jeff and his team accomplish over the next five years. We are armed to succeed.\"\nABOUT DIVURGENT:\nDivurgent is not the typical healthcare consulting firm. As a nationally recognized company focused on the business of hospitals, health systems, payers, and affiliated providers, we are committed to healthcare IT evolution, deploying customized, scalable solutions that help our clients achieve improved operational effectiveness, financial performance, and quality of patient care.
