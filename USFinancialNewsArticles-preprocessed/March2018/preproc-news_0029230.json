(NASDAQ:HCOM) reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. The highlights are as follows:\nRevenue was $91.6 million for the fourth quarter and $368.4 million for full year 2017:\nTV revenue rose 4.1 percent and 7.5 percent year-over-year for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively, driven by solid TV subscriber growth.\nConsumer strategic revenue for full year 2017 increased 6.0 percent over the last two years and represented 52 percent of total consumer revenue, compared to 46 percent two years ago.\nBusiness VoIP revenue grew 15.0 percent and 14.0 percent year-over-year for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively, driven by robust demand for the Company’s hosted voice solution.\nBusiness strategic revenue (1) for full year 2017 increased 10.9 percent over the last two years and represented 39 percent of total business revenue, compared to 34 percent two years ago.\nWholesale revenue from high-bandwidth services grew 41.3 percent and 19.1 percent year-over-year for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, respectively, driven by strong Ethernet growth and trans-Pacific fiber circuit capacity sales.\nFiber-enabled approximately 4,500 business addresses and 4,000 consumer households during 2017, bringing total fiber-enabled business addresses to over 11,000, total Next-Generation Network (NGN) households on O‘ahu to 206,000, and over 5,000 CAF II fiber-enabled locations on the neighbor islands.\nIncurred fourth quarter 2017 net loss of $9.1 million, or $0.78 per diluted share and full year 2017 net loss of $107.2 million, or $9.27 per diluted share. The full year net loss was primarily due to an $88.0 million income tax provision, the largest component of which was a one-time, non-cash valuation allowance established on the Company’s deferred tax assets in the third quarter 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA (2) was $24.7 million for the fourth quarter and $104.0 million for the full year 2017.\nRegulatory review processes for the merger with Cincinnati Bell are well underway with the Federal Communications Commission and the Public Utilities Commission of the State of Hawai‘i. The merger approval process continues to progress as anticipated and the transaction is expected to close as soon as all regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions are met.\n“In the fourth quarter, we continued to strategically invest in our network and transform our revenue streams from legacy to strategic services,” said Scott K. Barber, Hawaiian Telcom’s president and CEO. “In the consumer channel, we continued to gain market share with our strategic IPTV and fiber Internet product, recording the 22 nd consecutive quarter of year-over-year TV subscriber growth and the best quarter for Internet net adds since the beginning of 2013. Our consumer strategic revenue is now 52 percent of total consumer revenue, compared to 46 percent just two years ago. These results demonstrate the strong customer demand for our superior fiber product suite and highlight the fact that where we have fiber, we ultimately win. With an inventory of 206,000 fiber-enabled homes on O‘ahu, we have ample opportunity to continue to increase penetration in our market.\n“In the business and wholesale channels, we continued to leverage our dense fiber footprint to extend fiber to businesses and cost-effectively connect wireless cell sites. The increased demand for additional bandwidth and our ability to offer customers next-generation services and integrated solutions to help them achieve their desired business outcomes are helping to drive consistent growth in our strategic IP-based services such as business VoIP and high-bandwidth fiber Internet. Business strategic revenue is now 39 percent of total business revenue, compared to 34 percent two years ago. In addition, our wholesale business was recently awarded a major contract to build out fiber facilities to over 160 new cell sites to support a large national wireless carrier’s expansion project. With these additional cell sites, we now provide backhaul to the vast majority of all cell sites in Hawai‘i and continue to see significant growth opportunity for Fiber-to-the-Tower and small cell deployments in our market.\n“I am pleased with the progress we made in 2017 and look forward to the opportunities we have ahead. The fiber investments we have made in our network provide a solid foundation for us to transform our company. Together with Cincinnati Bell, we are confident that we will be able to leverage our combined scale, expanded capabilities, and increased fiber investments to drive sustainable growth, cash flow generation, and bring long-term benefits for our customers and other stakeholders,” concluded Barber.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nFourth quarter revenue was $91.6 million, down $5.2 million year-over-year but up $0.6 million sequentially. The year-over-year change was primarily due to revenue growth in consumer video, business VoIP, and high-bandwidth fiber Internet and data services being more than offset by revenue declines associated with legacy voice and low-bandwidth Internet and data services, as well as lower levels of equipment sales.\nThe Company incurred a net loss of $9.1 million, or $0.78 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a net loss of $0.2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for fourth quarter 2017 was $24.7 million.\nBusiness Revenue\nFourth quarter business revenue totaled $42.1 million, down $2.2 million year-over-year but up $0.3 million sequentially. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by lower levels of equipment sales and the decline in legacy voice and low-bandwidth Internet services, as well as lower average revenue per unit on certain data services due to promotional pricing. These decreases were partly offset by continued growth in high-bandwidth fiber Internet and data services, as well as a 15.0 percent year-over-year increase in business VoIP revenue, driven by strong demand for Hawaiian Telcom’s hosted voice solution.\nIn the fourth quarter, demand for the Company’s high-bandwidth fiber Internet products continued to grow. The number of business Internet subscribers on packages with 50 Mbps to 1 Gbps speeds grew 57.4 percent year-over-year and 17.2 percent sequentially. During the quarter, approximately 2,000 additional small business addresses were fiber-GPON-enabled, increasing the total number of enabled business addresses to over 11,000 as of December 31, 2017.\nFourth quarter business strategic revenue was $16.6 million, down 2.1 percent year-over-year but up 1.0 percent sequentially.\nConsumer Revenue\nFourth quarter consumer revenue totaled $33.5 million, down $1.6 million year-over-year and flat sequentially. Revenue growth in the quarter from Hawaiian Telcom TV and high-bandwidth fiber Internet services was more than offset by the year-over-year revenue decline in legacy voice and low-bandwidth copper Internet services. Fourth quarter consumer strategic revenue was $17.9 million, up 2.1 percent year-over-year and 0.9 percent sequentially, driven by strong demand for the Company’s strategic fiber-based products.\nHawaiian Telcom TV continued to lead revenue growth in the consumer channel. Video services revenue grew 4.1 percent year-over-year to $11.1 million for the fourth quarter and has become a $45 million and growing annualized revenue stream. Video subscribers grew 8.7 percent year-over-year, ending 2017 with approximately 45,200 subscribers, 25 percent of which were bulk multi-dwelling unit (MDU) video subscribers on multi-year contracts. When combined with approximately 7,800 additional single-play and double-play non-TV Internet subscribers on our NGN footprint, the penetration rate in our NGN footprint was approximately 26 percent at the end of 2017, an increase from 23 percent at the end of 2016.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company fiber-enabled 1,000 additional consumer households on O‘ahu, including success-based bulk MDUs and greenfield single-family homes, bringing total NGN households to 206,000, or approximately two-thirds of the total marketable households on O‘ahu. Approximately 64 percent of the Company’s NGN households were capable of utilizing Fiber-to-the-Home technology.\nTotal consumer Internet subscribers increased 0.9 percent compared to fourth quarter 2016, marking the first year-over-year subscriber growth in nearly two years as high-bandwidth fiber subscriber increases outweighed low-bandwidth copper subscriber declines. In the fourth quarter, the number of Internet subscribers on packages with 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps fiber speeds grew 81.4 percent year-over-year and 16.6 percent sequentially. Internet services revenue for the fourth quarter was down slightly year-over-year but up 2.6 percent quarter-over-quarter.\nWholesale Revenue\nFourth quarter wholesale revenue totaled $12.7 million, down $0.5 million year-over-year but up $0.2 million sequentially. Revenue from high-bandwidth, multi-year contract wholesale services including Ethernet, trans-Pacific fiber circuit capacity, and optical transport services increased 41.3 percent year-over-year and now represents 37 percent of total wholesale revenue, up from 25 percent in the same period a year ago. This revenue growth was offset by the revenue decline from certain wholesale customers disconnecting low-bandwidth, less efficient legacy circuits on month-to-month service.\nOperating Expenses\nFourth quarter operating expenses totaled $91.9 million, down $1.1 million compared to fourth quarter 2016. Operating expenses, exclusive of non-cash and special items which are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA calculation, decreased $1.4 million year-over-year to $66.9 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower salaries, wages and benefits as a result of improved operational efficiencies and other cost savings initiatives, as well as decreased cost of goods as a result of lower levels of equipment sales. These decreases were partially offset by higher direct cost of services related to video from rising content costs and increasing numbers of video subscribers.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nRevenue was $368.4 million, compared to $393.0 million for full year 2016. Contributing to the year-over-year decrease was approximately $5.0 million in one-time revenues from a large government agency recorded in the first half of 2016, declines in low-margin enterprise equipment sales, and revenue decreases associated with legacy voice and low-bandwidth Internet services offsetting revenue increases from consumer video, business VoIP, and high-bandwidth Internet and data services. Adjusted EBITDA was $104.0 million, resulting in an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 28.2 percent.\nNet loss for the full year 2017 was $107.2 million, or $9.27 per diluted share, compared with net income for the full year 2016 of $1.1 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to an $87.4 million increase in the income tax provision for full year 2017, mainly caused by a one-time, non-cash valuation allowance established on the Company’s deferred tax assets in the third quarter 2017. The requirement to establish this allowance was due to the pre-tax losses incurred by the Company in 2017. This valuation allowance does not preclude the Company from using its net operating loss carryforwards in the future. As of December 31, 2017, net operating losses available for carry forward through 2037 amounted to $222.6 million for federal purposes and $227.0 million for state purposes.\nCapital Expenditures and Liquidity\nFor the full year 2017, capital expenditures totaled $95.3 million, compared to $97.8 million for the full year 2016. Approximately 86 percent of 2017 total capital expenditures was directed towards growth and expansion initiatives, which included payments on the trans-Pacific undersea cable system, Connect America Fund build out, spending on the Fiber-to-the-Business initiative, as well as success-based spending to support the growth of the Company’s next-generation services.\nAt the end of 2017, the Company had $40.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared to $15.8 million at the end of 2016. The increase in cash was primarily due to our new term loan financing in May 2017 and the up-front payments received for fiber circuit capacity on our trans-Pacific cable that was completed in August 2017. Net Debt (3) was $268.6 million, resulting in a Net Leverage Ratio (4) as of December 31, 2017 of 2.6x. Levered Free Cash Flow (5) for full year 2017 was negative $6.0 million.\nConference Call\nDue to the pending merger with Cincinnati Bell, the Company will not host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains information about adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA), Net Debt, Net Leverage Ratio and Levered Free Cash Flow.
