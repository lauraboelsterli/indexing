    "text": "(Reuters) - Canada’s No.2 marijuana producer Aurora Cannabis Inc ( ACB.TO ) on Wednesday received final regulatory approval for the purchase of smaller rival CanniMed Therapeutics Inc ( CMED.TO ), which would make it the world’s most valuable weed producer.\nThe approval of the C$1.1 billion ($857.37 million) deal from the Competition Bureau follows months of tensions between the companies and comes at a time when companies are jostling to gain from the country’s legalization of recreational use of pot.\nAurora had initially made a hostile bid capped at C$24 per share for CanniMed in November and increased it to C$43 in the new offer.\nCannimed, which was already engaged in a friendly deal to buy Newstrike Resources ( HIP.V ), canceled it in January in favor of the increased Aurora offer.\nReporting by Ahmed Farhatha in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur\n ",
