    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas, March 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Superconductor Technologies Inc. (STI) (Nasdaq:SCON) reported financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\n“In 2017, we made significant advances in our next generation electric machines (NGEMs) development work both with industry leaders and in our project with the Department of Energy (DOE), on which we are collaborating with TECO Westinghouse Motor Company, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of North Texas,” stated Jeff Quiram, STI’s president and CEO. “The DOE project, which began in the second quarter of 2017, resulted in full year net revenues more than triple 2016 net revenues. STI is the prime recipient of a $4.5 million, three-year award under the DOE’s broad goal of advancing American manufacturing competitiveness by improving industrial motor efficiency to significantly reduce energy usage and the cost of operation. Looking forward, we are very excited about the revenue potential from the commercialization of our Conductus ® 2G HTS wire in applications that leverage unparalleled performance when operating at low temperature in the presence of a magnetic field.\"\nDOE project objectives:\nYear one ending Q2 2018: Continue to improve critical current capacity at 65K in the presence of an operating magnetic field of 1.5 Tesla.\nYear two ending Q2 2019: Focus on optimizing the design and fabrication of ‘best-in-class’ wire in quantity.\nYear three ending Q2 2020: Build and validate an NGEM component that includes cryogenic testing.\n“As recently announced, we have aligned our future Conductus ® wire product development efforts with NGEMs, whose applications are expected to generate the largest demand for superconducting wire in the future. With 2G HTS wire performance, and a unique HTS manufacturing process, we are well positioned to capitalize on several accelerating energy megatrends for which NGEMs are particularly well suited, including decentralized renewable energy, high energy efficiency, and sustainable transportation,” concluded Quiram.\n2017 Company Highlights\nSTI was awarded a DOE contract for an NGEMs program with partners TECO Westinghouse Motor Company, MIT, and the University of North Texas. STI made a 40% improvement in the performance of its 2G HTS wire at low temperature and in the presence of magnetic field, an important metric for NGEMs. The Robinson Research Institute, a lab recognized internationally as an expert in the development of innovative superconducting products, independently confirmed that Conductus ® wire met the required specifications for low temperature in the presence of a magnetic field. STI was granted two patents that protect the company’s unique HTS wire manufacturing capabilities. One is for STI’s intrinsic pinning method and the other is for STI’s automated machine architecture. David Vellequette rejoined STI’s Board of Directors.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year Financial Summary\nSTI’s fourth quarter 2017 net revenues were $305,000, compared to $130,000 in the third quarter of 2017 and $9,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss for the fourth quarter 2017 was $1.8 million, or a loss of $0.17 per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $2.5 million, or a loss of $0.23 per basic and diluted share, in the third quarter of 2017, and a net loss of $2.5 million, or a loss of $0.61 per basic and diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the year ending Dec. 31, 2017, total net revenues were $446,000, compared to $131,000 for the year ended Dec. 31, 2016. The net loss for the year 2017 was $9.5 million, or $0.91 per share, compared to $11.1 million, or $3.53 per share for the year 2016.\nAs of Dec.31, 2017, STI had $3.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. In March of 2018 STI raised approximately $1.7 million in net proceeds from a registered direct offering. In connection with the offering, the company issued a total of 1,581,000 shares of common stock and common stock equivalents.\nInvestor Conference Call\nSTI will host a conference call and simultaneous webcast today, March 22 nd , at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time / 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time to discuss its results.

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are inherently subject to uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our limited cash and a history of losses; our need to materially grow our revenues from commercial operations and/or to raise additional capital (which financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all) in the very near future, before cash reserves are depleted (which reserves are expected to be sufficient into the third quarter of 2018), to implement our current business plan and maintain our viability; the performance and use of our equipment to produce wire in accordance with our timetable; overcoming technical challenges in attaining milestones to develop and manufacture commercial lengths of our HTS wire; the possibility of delays in customer evaluation and acceptance of our HTS wire; the limited number of potential customers and customer pressures on the selling prices of our products; the limited number of suppliers for some of our components and our HTS wire; there being no significant backlog from quarter to quarter; our market being characterized by rapidly advancing technology; the impact of competitive products, technologies and pricing; manufacturing capacity constraints and difficulties; the impact of any financing activity on the level of our stock price; the dilutive impact of any issuances of securities to raise capital; the steps required to maintain the listing of our common stock with a U.S. national securities exchange and the impact on the liquidity and trading price of our common stock if we fail to maintain such listing; the cost and uncertainty from compliance with environmental regulations; and local, regional, and national and international economic conditions and events and the impact they may have on us and our customers.\nForward-looking statements can be affected by many other factors, including, those described in the \"Business\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" sections of STI's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and in STI's other public filings.
