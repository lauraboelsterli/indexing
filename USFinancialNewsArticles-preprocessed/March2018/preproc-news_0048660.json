    "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C., March 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chanticleer Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:BURG) (“Chanticleer,” or the “Company”), owner, operator and franchisor of multiple branded restaurants in the U.S. and abroad, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nAnnual Financial Highlights for the Year ended December 31, 2017\nRevenue for the year was $41.4 million compared with $41.7 million in 2016\nCost of sales as a percentage of restaurant sales was 33.8% in 2017, compared to 33.0% in 2016, on higher beef, chicken and distribution costs, which are expected to moderate in future periods.\nGeneral and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue improved to 11.0% in 2017 from 13.9% in 2016\nG&A levels have been reduced over the past 2 years as a result of integration and efficiency initiatives\nOperating loss from continuing operations was $5.2 million ($2.8 million excluding non-cash asset impairment charges) in 2017 compared to $2.6 million in 2016.\nNet loss attributable to Common Shareholders was $6.9 million, ($2.73) per share in 2017, compared to $9.1 million, ($4.18) per share in 2016.\nNon-Gaap Restaurant EBITDA was $4.2 million in 2017 compared to $5.0 million in 2016\nNon-Gaap Adjusted EBITDA was $234 thousand in 20017 compared to $82 thousand in 2016\nCash used in operating activities was negative $0.7 million in 2017 compared to negative $0.5 million in 2016.\nDuring 2017, the Company initiated its growth phase opening 4 new Little Big Burger locations, 1 new BGR location and expects to open 8 to 12 new locations annually. The Company also closed 4 underperforming company locations in 2017 which resulted in non-cash impairment charges and is expected to contribute to improved operating performance in future periods.\nMike Pruitt, Chairman and CEO of Chanticleer commented, “In 2017 we solidified our foundation by closing underperforming units, opening four Little Big Burger units, executing multiple franchise agreements and signing five leases under our financial partner joint venture that will open in 2018. We believe the Company has reached an inflection point as we continue to accelerate growth of our Little Big Burger concept with new locations generating above average unit economics and outperforming our expectations. This growth phase consists of a robust pipeline of locations to support future growth, currently expecting to open 8-12 new Little Big Burger stores annually going forward, with upside to those expectations as new franchisees come on line.”\nPruitt continued, “Chanticleer is in process of evolving and narrowing its strategic focus and allocation of resources to the domestic better burger segment where we generate the highest margins and rates of return. As we increase focus on the domestic burger business, we are continuing to evaluate the potential sale of our domestic non-burger and international operations which would streamline the Company’s operations and significantly increase operating margins going forward.\nLastly, I’m thankful to our financial partners, both JV & franchise, that will allow us to double our Little Big Burger locations and continue BGR on a successful path. We shortly hope to announce new relationships that will allow us visibility on executing on our plan.”\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a webcast and conference call on Wednesday, March 28, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. ET.\nTo access the call, dial 1-877-407-0784 approximately five minutes prior to the scheduled start time.

In addition to disclosing financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company discloses information regarding Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant EBITDA, which differ from the term EBITDA as it is commonly used. In addition to adjusting net income (loss) from continuing operations to exclude taxes, interest, and depreciation and amortization, Adjusted EBITDA also excludes pre-opening and closing costs for our restaurants, non-cash expenses, transaction and severance related expenses, change in fair value of derivative liability and other income and expenses.\nIn addition, Restaurant EBITDA also excludes management fee income, franchise revenue and general and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA and restaurant EBITDA are not measures of performance defined in accordance with GAAP. However, adjusted EBITDA and restaurant EBITDA are used internally in planning and evaluating the company's operating performance and by the Company’s creditors. Accordingly, management believes that disclosure of these metrics offers investors, bankers and other stakeholders an additional view of the company's operations that, when coupled with the GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of the Company's financial results.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Restaurant EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to net loss or to net cash used in operating activities as a measure of operating results or of liquidity. It may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it excludes financial information that some may consider important in evaluating the company's performance. A reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Restaurant EBITDA is included in the accompanying financial schedules.\nFor further information, please refer to Chanticleer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K to be filed with the SEC on or about March 28, 2018, available online at www.sec.gov .\nAbout Chanticleer Holdings, Inc.\nHeadquartered in Charlotte, NC, Chanticleer Holdings (BURG), owns, operates and franchises fast casual and full service restaurant brands, including American Burger Company, BGR – Burgers Grilled Right, Little Big Burger, Just Fresh and Hooters.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
