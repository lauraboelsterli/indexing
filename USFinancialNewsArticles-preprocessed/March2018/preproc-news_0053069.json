    "text": "Financial Services Leader to Identify New Product and Market Opportunities for Business Growth\nWILMINGTON, Del.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Marlette Funding, LLC, owner of the Best Egg personal loan platform, today announced the addition of Marshall Lux as an Advisor to the Board and Company.\nMarshall Lux has been a Financial Services consultant and practitioner for 30 years. He began his career at McKinsey where he served all manner of financial service firms across a variety of subsectors and functional areas. Marshall led McKinsey's and BCG's private equity practice. He has extensive relationships across PE Firms. He left McKinsey after approximately 25 years to become the Chief Risk Officer for Chase (all consumer products globally) during the financial crisis. He then joined BCG, where he was a Senior Partner for 5 years, and in particular, helped build a private equity practice. Marshall graduated from the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University. He also attended Harvard Business School where he was a Baker and Ford Scholar and currently Lux is a Senior Fellow at Harvard’s Kennedy School Mossaver-Rahmani Center for Business and Government.\n“Marshall is a terrific fit for us as he has both extensive financial services experience, as well as domain expertise in the consumer lending market,” said Jeffrey Meiler, founder and CEO, Marlette Funding. “He also brings a valuable perspective to our board around new product innovation that can disrupt various markets.”\nLux recently released a paper entitled When Markets Quake: The Past, Present, and Future of Online Lending. Marshall has spoken broadly, including before the House Small Business Committee, the Federal Reserve, and various Universities and trade groups. Marshall is also a member of the Board of Governors of the Online Lending Policy Institute.\n“I am impressed with Best Egg’s focus on customer experience, API-centric technology stack and the year over year consistent, strong performance – the platform is clearly outpacing the industry at large,” said Marshall Lux. “I look forward to working with Marlette Funding’s executive team and board to maximize the company’s full potential.”\nAbout Marlette Funding and Best Egg\nMarlette Funding, through its consumer-lending brand Best Egg, is a financial technology provider on a mission to find better ways to make money accessible to allow people to enjoy life.
