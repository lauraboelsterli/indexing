Official data published this month showed retail sales barely rose in January.\nThe Bank of England expects the consumer squeeze to ease in 2018 as inflation cools and wage growth ticks higher, although surveys published on Wednesday suggested sentiment remains subdued, with consumers“jittery and depressed”.\nCarpetright said UK trading conditions since it last updated on Jan. 19 had“remained difficult characterised by continued weak consumer confidence.”\nIt said that while the trend in UK like-for-like sales had improved, it remained negative. Trading in the Rest of Europe division had also improved, led by a recovery in like-for-like sales in the Netherlands.\nCarpetright forecast a small underlying pretax loss for the year to April 28.\n“The group is therefore proactively engaged in constructive discussions with its bank lenders in order to ensure it continues to comply with the terms of its prevailing bank facilities,” it said.\nIt said its lenders have indicated that they currently remain“fully supportive”.\nCarpetright said it also examining a range of options to accelerate its turnaround and strengthen its balance sheet.\nAnalysts at Peel Hunt, which have a“hold” stance on the stock, forecast a full year pretax loss of 4.3 million pounds ($5.92 million), having previously expected a profit of 3 million pounds.\nThey expect the talks with lenders to result in a covenant reset.\nShares in Carpetright were down 20 pence at 58.4 pence at 0908 GMT, valuing the business at 39.5 million pounds.\nThe stock has lost 74 percent of its value over the last year.
