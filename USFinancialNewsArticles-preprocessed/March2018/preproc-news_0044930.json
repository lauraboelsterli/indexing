    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, March 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The DigitalBits Project (“DigitalBits”) today announced the appointment of David K. Holland, former senior vice president and treasurer at Cisco Systems, Inc. and Julie Lyle, former chief marketing officer at Walmart, to its advisory board. Holland and Lyle join other industry leaders on DigitalBits’ advisory board, many of whom have held leadership positions at Red Hat, LoyaltyOne, Points.com , American Express, TokenStack Partners and other companies in the technology, loyalty and rewards space.\n“David and Julie bring deep expertise and industry acumen to our advisory board,” said Al Burgio, Founder, The DigitalBits Project. “Together with the rest of the advisory team, David and Julie will offer invaluable leadership and new perspectives as we help the multi-billion dollar loyalty and rewards industry overcome some of its longstanding issues of friction and liquidity, with the decentralized DigitalBits blockchain.”\nHolland has had an extensive career in the technology industry, having held multiple executive positions at Cisco over a span of 15 years. Prior to Cisco, Holland worked for Paribas Capital Markets, leading a group that advised and transacted with multinational corporations, central banks, and hedge funds. Earlier in his career, Holland worked within the manufacturing finance, corporate finance, and treasury divisions of Apple Inc. for 10 years.\n“I’m excited to have joined the advisory board at such a pivotal point for DigitalBits,” said Holland. “There’s a lot of opportunity with blockchain technology, and I believe that the Project has found the perfect niche in the loyalty and rewards industry. With the DigitalBits Network now live, I look forward to really digging in and tapping into my leadership experience in the technology industry to guide the Project as it grows and more partners join the DigitalBits ecosystem.”\nLyle has more than 20 years of retail and marketing experience, and currently serves as the interim CMO at Barnes & Noble, Inc. Previously, she’s served as CMO at Walmart, chief merchandising and marketing officer at Pamida and chief revenue officer at Raytheon, among other leadership positions. She has also served as CMO and member of the Board of Directors for Prudential Corporation Asia. Lyle has a proven track record of driving revenue through business development and creating seamless online and offline consumer experiences, as well as leading re-branding and marketing planning initiatives.\n“Throughout my career in the marketing and retail industry, I’ve seen some of the fundamental ways loyalty and rewards programs have missed the mark,” said Lyle. “The industry is ready for technology like blockchain and a Project like DigitalBits that will inject liquidity and value back into loyalty and rewards programs, for both the good of the merchant and the consumer. My time on the DigitalBits advisory board will be spent working with the team to continue identifying and closing the gap on some of the industry’s biggest pain points.”\nAdditional Resources\nLearn more about DigitalBits’ vision, the blockchain network and how it supports the loyalty and rewards industry, by reading our recent press releases Join our Telegram community at DigitalBits View our video on SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE from Blockchain Unbound Follow us on Twitter @DigitalBitsOrg Find us on LinkedIn at The DigitalBits Project\nAbout The DigitalBits Project\nThe DigitalBits Project is an open-source project focused on developing a secure, low-cost global transaction network, protocol and tools for anyone to use, including but not limited to businesses with loyalty and rewards programs and their users. The DigitalBits Network’s native digital asset (“digitalbits” or “XDB”) secures the network, enables functional use of wallets, and is required to cover nominal transaction fees on the network. Loyalty program operators can also create their respective loyalty points as digital assets on this decentralized network and users can trade these various digital assets on-chain along with XDB.\nThe vision for The DigitalBits Project is to see the DigitalBits blockchain help solve certain portability and liquidity issues with many Loyalty and Rewards programs, and help generate additional value for consumers, businesses and certain charitable organizations.
