The company is driven by a mission to identify, develop and bring to market a diverse portfolio of novel and differentiated therapies that expand treatment options, improve outcomes and facilitate convenience for women, primarily in the areas of contraception, vaginal health, sexual health and fertility. Daré currently has two product candidates in clinical development. The first is Ovaprene™, a non-hormonal monthly contraceptive ring intended to provide protection over multiple weeks between menses. The second is SST-6007 (5% Topical Sildenafil Citrate Cream), a potential treatment for Female Sexual Arousal Disorder. SST-6007 incorporates sildenafil, the same active ingredient in Viagra ® , in a proprietary cream formulation that is specifically designed to locally increase blood flow to the vulvar-vaginal tissue in women, leading to a potential improvement in genital arousal response and overall sexual experience. Daré also has an option to enter into a license agreement for ORB-204 and ORB-214, preclinical stage injectable etonogestrel contraceptives with target 6- and 12-month durations.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding matters that are not historical facts, including statements relating to Daré's ability to develop Ovaprene and Topical Sildenafil at the cost and in accordance with the targeted timelines and milestones set forth herein, expectations regarding the anticipated market demands for its products, the safety and effectiveness of its products, market acceptance of Daré's products and the qualifications and expertise of Daré's management team. Because such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including the uncertainties inherent in the initiation and completion of clinical trials; availability and timing of data from ongoing and future clinical trials and the results of such trials; whether preliminary results from a clinical trial will be predictive of the final results of that trial or whether results of early clinical trials will be indicative of the results of later clinical trials, expectations for regulatory approvals; claims of infringement and other risks relating to Daré's owned and licensed intellectual property rights, and other factors discussed in the \"Risk Factors\" section of Daré's Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 28, 2018. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in Daré's reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Daré's reports on Forms 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K. In addition, any forward-looking statements included in this press release represent our views only as of the date of this release and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. Daré specifically disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements included in this press release.\nContacts:\nInvestors on behalf of Daré Bioscience, Inc.:\nAmi Bavishi\nBurns McClellan\nabavishi@burnsmc.com\n212-213-0006\nOR\nMedia on behalf of Daré Bioscience, Inc.:\nAmanda Guisbond\nCanale Communications\namanda@canalecomm.com\n781-405-8775\nSource: Daré Bioscience\nSource:Dare Bioscience, Inc.",
