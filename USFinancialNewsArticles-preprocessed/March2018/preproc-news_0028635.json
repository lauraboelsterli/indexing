(NASDAQ:MGEN), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of RNA-targeted therapies, today reported fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results and provided a corporate update.\n“2017 was a remarkable year for miRagen, underscored by the clinical success and advancement of our two lead programs, cobomarsen (MRG-106) and MRG-201, and we believe we are well-positioned to make advances in the development of our product candidates in 2018,” said miRagen President and Chief Executive Officer William S. Marshall, Ph.D. “The cobomarsen Phase 1 results have been encouraging, and we plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate cobomarsen in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) this year. We have designed this trial to allow the possibility of accelerated approval in the United States, subject to the outcome of the trial. In 2018, we expect to initiate four clinical trials, including the Phase 2 SOLAR trial evaluating cobomarsen in CTCL, a Phase 2 trial for MRG-201 in cutaneous fibrosis and two Phase 1 trials in collaboration with Servier for MRG-110 to support development in ischemic diseases. Additionally, in 2018 we expect to report interim data from our Phase 1 trial evaluating cobomarsen in multiple hematological malignancies beyond CTCL.”\nBusiness Highlights and Update\nData from Phase 1 trial supports advancing cobomarsen (MRG-106) into a Phase 2 potentially registrational trial for CTCL: In February 2018, miRagen announced interim results from its ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of cobomarsen in patients with the mycosis fungoides form of CTCL. These data showed 26 of 29 evaluable patients, or 90%, with improved modified Severity Weighted Assessment Tool (mSWAT) scores, a measurement of the severity of skin disease. Four of five patients (80%) who were treated with 300 mg IV infusion achieved a 50% or greater mSWAT reduction, which the Company believes represents an important beneficial clinical response. Cobomarsen has been generally well-tolerated to date at the range of doses tested.\nmiRagen intends to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial for cobomarsen in patients with CTCL in the second half of 2018. Based on recent meetings with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, miRagen anticipates the trial will employ an open-label, parallel group, randomized design to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 300 mg of cobomarsen given by intravenous infusion versus an active control.\nThe Company also began evaluating cobomarsen in three additional oncology indications within the current Phase 1 trial. These additional indications include chronic lymphocytic leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. In each of these expansion indications, the disease process appears to correlate with an increase in microRNA-155 levels. The Company plans to release interim Phase 1 data in at least one of these expansion indications in the second half of 2018.\nPhase 1 trial completed, supports advancing MRG-201 into a Phase 2 trial in the first half of 2018: miRagen completed a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating MRG-201 in induced cutaneous fibrosis in 2017. 54 volunteers participated in the clinical trial, and MRG-201 was generally well tolerated at all dose levels evaluated. In addition, miRagen believes the clinical trial provided evidence that MRG-201 regulated fibrogenesis in humans. In the clinical trial, treatment with MRG-201 appeared to result in a reduction in fibroplasia, a histopathological marker of scar tissue deposition, while not effecting wound healing. In the first half of 2018, the Company intends to initiate a Phase 2 trial to evaluate MRG-201 in subjects with a predisposition for keloid formation.\nmiRagen also anticipates releasing preclinical in vivo data from lung and ocular fibrosis studies in 2018.\nmiRagen-Servier strategic alliance advances with Servier filing a clinical trial authorization to initiate the first of two Phase 1 clinical trials planned for MRG-110: In the first half of 2018, Servier plans to initiate a Phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of MRG-110 (S95010) in a systemic dosing protocol. This Phase 1 trial may allow miRagen and Servier to establish the recommended Phase 2 clinical trial dose for the treatment of patients with heart failure. The Phase 1 clinical trial results will also be analyzed for biomarkers that may provide mechanistic proof of concept and support further potential clinical trials of MRG-110 in the treatment of cardiovascular disease and certain other conditions where vascular flow is compromised.\nAlso, during the first half of 2018, miRagen plans to initiate a separate Phase 1 trial assessing the safety and tolerability of MRG-110 after intradermal administration in healthy volunteers. The intradermal administration clinical trial is intended to support additional clinical studies necessary to achieve regulatory approval for the use of MRG-110 in other diseases, including dermatological applications, where increased vascularity may result in better healing and improved outcomes.\nServier is responsible for leading the global clinical development and potential commercialization of MRG-110 in all countries except the United States and Japan, where miRagen retains all rights.\nAnticipated Milestones\nCobomarsen (blood cancers) Presentation of additional Phase 1 CTCL data, including response rates from longer-term duration of treatment (1H 2018) Phase 1 interim clinical data release in at least one potential expansion indication (2H 2018) Initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial in CTCL (2H 2018) Presentation of Phase 2 CTCL clinical trial data (2H 2020)\nMRG-201 (pathologic fibrosis) Initiation of a Phase 2 clinical trial in cutaneous fibrosis (1H 2018) Ocular fibrosis data release from preclinical models (1H 2018) Preclinical safety and efficacy lung fibrosis data release (2H 2018) Presentation of Phase 2 cutaneous fibrosis clinical trial data (2019)\nMRG-110 (ischemic disease) Initiation of two Phase 1 trials (1H 2018)\nFinancial Results\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 were $47.4 million, compared to $22.1 million at December 31, 2016. Total net cash used in operations was approximately $7.2 million and $28.2 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively. In February 2018, miRagen completed an underwritten public offering of 7,414,996 shares of its common stock. Gross proceeds to miRagen from the offering were $40.8 million before deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other offering expenses. As a result of this financing and based on miRagen’s current clinical development plans, the company expects its cash runway will extend into early 2020.\nNet loss available to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $26.5 million, or $1.38 per share, and $6.4 million, or $0.29 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to a net loss of $17.3 million, or $28.21 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $6.0 million, or $9.20 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nRevenue was $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and $1.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $0.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by increases in research and development activity reimbursable under miRagen’s agreement with Servier.\nResearch and development expenses were $19.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and $5.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $3.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in research and development expenses was driven primarily by higher clinical trial and related outsourced manufacturing costs to support expanded development stage programs together with increased personnel costs as the Company added to its research and development team in 2017.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and $2.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to $6.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $2.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2017 was due primarily to increases in insurance, consulting, professional fees and board compensation, related to the Company’s expanded operations since becoming a public company in February 2017. The Company also incurred higher personnel related costs, due primarily to an increase in share-based compensation charges, as well as an increase in general and administrative employees during 2017.\nConference Call Information\nmiRagen will host a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. Participants may access the call by dialing (800) 289-0438 in the U.S. or (323) 994-2083 outside the U.S. and providing the conference ID number 5740056.
