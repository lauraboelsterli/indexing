    "text": "COLOMBO, March 6 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan shares dropped to their lowest close in nearly three weeks on Tuesday amid investors’ concerns about communal violence.\nThe country declared a nationwide state of emergency for 10 days on Tuesday to stop the spread of violence, after clashes erupted between majority Buddhists and members of the minority Muslim community.\n“Market came down with investors worried over the government declaring state of emergency,” said Atchuthan Srirangan, a senior research analyst at First Capital Holdings PLC.\n“Investors are waiting to see how foreign investors will react to this state of emergency.”\nThe Colombo stock index ended 0.3 percent weaker at 6,533.46, following a 0.28 percent drop last week.\nTurnover was 436.8 million rupees ($2.82 million), less than half of this year’s daily average of 954.9 million rupees.\nAnalysts said local investors continued to be on the sidelines as they were still worried about political uncertainty.\nForeign investors bought a net 27.9 million rupees worth of shares on Tuesday, extending the year-to-date net foreign inflow to 6 billion rupees worth of equities so far this year.\nShares of conglomerate John Keells Holdings Plc fell 0.7 percent, Ceylon Tobacco Co Plc ended 0.4 percent weaker and Browns Investments Plc declined 7.7 percent.\nSri Lanka’s two key parties in the ruling coalition last week decided to remain in the ruling coalition, allaying fears of a government collapse.\nPresident Maithripala Sirisena reshuffled his cabinet last week, appointing his prime minister as the law and order minister, after the governing coalition suffered a series of defeats in local elections earlier this month.\nHowever, the changes failed to boost the market as the cabinet reshuffle was not enough to address the election defeats, analysts said.
