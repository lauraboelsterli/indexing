    "text": "SALISBURY, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Food Lion announced today that it has entered into a transaction to purchase three Farm Fresh stores in the Greater Norfolk, Va., area from SUPERVALU. The locations include:\n1615 General Booth Blvd., Virginia Beach, Va. 23454 608 Mercury Blvd., Hampton, Va. 23663 683 South Hughes Blvd., Elizabeth City, N.C. 27909\n\"We are so excited to add these three new locations to our network of more than 100 stores serving the greater Norfolk area,\" said Food Lion President, Meg Ham. \"We are part of the fabric of this community. We've been here in the towns and cities of Hampton Roads nourishing our neighbors and customers for nearly 40 years. With the addition of these three new stores, we have an even greater opportunity to serve more customers with fresh, quality products at affordable prices every day with the caring, friendly service they expect from Food Lion.\"\nAll locations will remain open as Farm Fresh stores until the transaction is complete, which is expected in May. Pharmacies at all locations will also remain open through the transition and will be operated by Food Lion once the transaction is complete.\nIn addition to its longstanding heritage of low prices, Food Lion makes shopping easy and affordable for customers through its MVP loyalty program, with weekly promotions as well as its newly-launched Shop & Earn monthly rewards program, that provides even greater savings through personalized rewards and special offers on items shoppers buy most. Food Lion also has a convenient mobile app that provides easy access to digital coupons, mobile shopping lists and much more.\nFood Lion also will extend its commitment to supporting local communities through its hunger relief philanthropic platform, Food Lion Feeds. As part of today's announcement, Food Lion is donating 3,000 meals to local families for each new store to the following food banks that support these communities â€“ the Virginia Peninsula Foodbank, the Foodbank of Southeastern Virginia and the Eastern Shore, and the Food Bank of the Albemarle. Food Lion will also ensure each new store will be assigned a feeding agency partner to receive weekly food donations through the company's food rescue program.\nThrough Food Lion Feeds, the company has made a commitment to provide 500 million meals to individuals and families in need by the end of 2020. Since the launch of Food Lion Feeds in 2014, Food Lion has already donated more than 362 million meals through in-store campaigns, in-store food rescue programs and associate volunteerism.\nAbout Food Lion\nFood Lion, based in Salisbury, N.C., since 1957, has more than 1,000 stores in 10 Southeastern and Mid-Atlantic states and employs more than 63,000 associates.
