    "text": "March 16, 2018 / 7:29 PM / Updated 27 minutes ago German defence ministry seeks continuity with new procurement chief Reuters Staff 3 Min Read BERLIN (Reuters) - The German general named on Friday to lead defence procurement reforms vowed to continue the course set by his predecessor, Katrin Suder, a former McKinsey consultant who won praise for boosting transparency and being frank with industry. Lieutenant General Benedikt Zimmer, now Suder’s deputy, will take over as state secretary after Suder decided to step down, the ministry said in a statement. “We will decisively continue the course we have charted,” Zimmer said. “It is our responsibility to push for the best possible equipment for our troops and the urgently needed digitalization of the Bundeswehr (German military).” The announcement should calm concerns voiced by German weapons makers who had worried that they might face another shift in procurement policy, depending on who replaced Suder. Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen said Zimmer had been Suder’s deputy since she arrived at the ministry in 2014, helping to shape reforms aimed at bringing order to military buying after repeated cost overruns and technical setbacks. “The reforms we have begun to modernize procurement need a steady course over many years,” she said. “With (Zimmer) we will be able to continue the plans we have begun.” Suder was the chief architect of reforms aimed at making the convoluted German procurement process more transparent and insulating the government from further massive cost overruns such as those seen on the troubled multi-nation A400M military transport program run by Airbus. Industry executives have generally welcomed Suder’s changes, although more stringent contractual needs have delayed some big programs, including a missile defence project to be run by Europe’s MBDA and Lockheed Martin of the United States. In a raft of other staffing changes, Lieutenant General Eberhard Zorn, now head of military personnel, was named to succeed General Volker Wieker, who will retire next month after eight years as the top uniformed officer in the Bundeswehr. Lieutenant General Karl Muellner, the head of the Air Force, will retire in May, will be replaced by Major General Ingo Gerhartz, the ministry said.
