    "text": "(Reuters) - Red Hat Inc ( RHT.N ) reported a 23 percent rise in quarterly revenue as the Linux operating system distributor benefited from robust demand for its hybrid cloud products.\nHybrid cloud services let customers run key business data on private, internal networks along with consumer-facing public cloud systems.\nThe company reported a net loss of $12.6 million, or 7 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 28, compared to a profit of $65.8 million, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier.\nRed Hatâ€™s fourth quarter results included a one-time tax charge of $123 million related to recently enacted U.S. tax laws.\nTotal revenue rose to $772.3 million from $628.8 million.\nReporting by Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta\n ",
