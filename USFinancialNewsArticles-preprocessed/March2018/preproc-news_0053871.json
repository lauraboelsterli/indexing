    "text": "Deutsche Bank AG’s chairman has reached out to potential external candidates for chief executive of the bank, gauging interest in replacing John Cryan after months of clashes, according to people briefed on the discussions.\nThe outreach by Chairman Paul Achleitner was described by one of the people as informal in nature, and hasn’t resulted in any immediate, definitive plans for succession at the German lender. Another person said the efforts picked up steam in the past month.\nStill, members of Deutsche Bank’s DB, -2.13% DBK, +1.14% supervisory board aren’t all aligned on CEO succession planning, according to people familiar with board deliberations, suggesting a lack of clear timing or certainty in a management change.\nPressure has ramped up on Cryan and other Deutsche Bank executives after the lender recently missed cost-cutting targets and its finance chief warned last week about weaker-than-expected first-quarter revenue, investors and others close to the bank say. Deutsche Bank shares have declined about 29% this year.\nDon’t miss : Deutsche Bank restates 2017 loss at higher level .\nSee also : Deutsche Bank executives give up their bonuses .\nAn expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com .\nMost popular at WSJ.com :\nWhite House probes loans to Kushner’s business .\nFacebook logs text, call histories for some Android users .\nMore from MarketWatch More Coverage Bloodbath for cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin sheds 10%, now down 40% year-to-date Home sellers now use spycams to gather intel on prospective buyers Trump boasts about making up facts about trade deficit to Trudeau ",
