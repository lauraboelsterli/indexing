    "text": "McDonald's Happy Meals Are Renewing an Old Friendship With Disney Photograph by Karen Bleier—AFP via Getty Images February 28, 2018 \nDisney toys are making their way back into a Happy Meal near you. \nAfter a 12-year hiatus, Disney dis and McDonald’s announced a new promotion partnership this week, due to begin in June. \nThe partnership will pair Happy Meals with figures from movies from Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar Animation Studios, Disney Live Action, Marvel Studios, and Lucasfilm. It will kick off with Incredibles 2 , followed by Wreck-It Ralph 2 in November. \nDisney and McDonald’s mcd last had a cross-promotional deal from 1996 to 2006, reportedly worth $1 billion to Disney . Disney chose not to renew the deal in 2006 after the company introduced new guidelines that “prohibited licensing of Mickey Mouse and other Disney characters for foods that fail to meet minimum nutrition requirements,” according to Reuters . \nAfter McDonald’s announced changes to its Happy Meals earlier this month, the fast food company has also promised to meet Disney standards by June, thereby allowing for the renewed partnership. \nWhile the length of the agreement has not been released, it is due to last multiple years. Unlike the earlier partnership, however, it is non-exclusive, meaning that both companies will be allowed to retain promotional partnerships with other companies.
