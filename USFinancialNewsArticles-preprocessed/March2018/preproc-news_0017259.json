    "text": "ROLLING MEADOWS, Ill., March 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MYR Group Inc. (“MYR” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:MYRG), a holding company of leading specialty contractors serving the electric utility infrastructure, commercial and industrial construction markets in the United States and western Canada, today announced its fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 financial results.\nHighlights for Fourth Quarter 2017\nFourth quarter revenues of $373.5 million, consistent with last quarter’s record high Fourth quarter net income of $13.6 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, including a $0.47 per diluted share benefit from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Backlog remains strong at $679.1 million\nManagement Comments\nRick Swartz, MYR's President and CEO said, “Our full year 2017 revenues of $1.4 billion set another record high for a third consecutive year. Our revenues improved in the third and fourth quarters, as we experienced an increase in overall project activity and significant bidding opportunities in both our Transmission & Distribution and Commercial & Industrial segments. Our solid backlog demonstrates that our business model is a sound platform for sustainable growth, and that we are meeting the needs of new and established customers while expanding service offerings to a larger geographical footprint. We expect active bidding to continue throughout 2018 and beyond, and believe MYR Group is well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities for growth and delivery of long-term value for all of our stakeholders.”\nFourth-Quarter Results\nMYR reported fourth quarter 2017 revenues of $373.5 million, an increase of $29.8 million, or 8.7 percent, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Specifically, our Transmission and Distribution (“T&D”) segment reported revenues of $227.9 million, a decrease of $23.0 million, or 9.2 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to a decrease in transmission revenues, partially offset by an increase in distribution projects. Our Commercial and Industrial (“C&I”) segment reported fourth-quarter 2017 revenues of $145.6 million, an increase of $52.9 million, or 57.0 percent, from the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to increased spending from existing customers and the Western Pacific Enterprises Ltd. (“WPE”) acquisition in late 2016.\nConsolidated gross profit decreased to $37.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $41.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to lower overall gross margin, partially offset by higher revenue. Gross margin decreased to 9.9 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 from 12.2 percent for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in gross margin was largely due to lower margins on certain projects due to weather, lower productivity and increased subcontractor costs, as well as project delays and schedule extensions. Margins were also negatively impacted from significant revenue on a large transmission project that had lower than average margins due to a high mix of material and subcontractor costs, which tend to have lower margins than when we utilize our own labor and equipment. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2017 we had a higher mix of revenue in our C&I segment and on distribution work, as compared to transmission work, which generally carries a higher margin. Changes in estimates of gross profit on certain projects resulted in gross margin decreases of 1.9 percent and 0.2 percent for the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) decreased to $24.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $26.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to lower bonus and profit sharing costs, partially offset by $0.6 million of costs associated with our expansion into new geographic markets and higher payroll costs to support operations. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A decreased to 6.4 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 from 7.8 percent for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOther expense was $2.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $1.2 million of other income in the fourth quarter of 2016. The $3.7 million increase in other expense was primarily due to a year-over-year change in contingent consideration associated with the WPE acquisition.\nWe had an income tax benefit of $2.9 million in fourth quarter of 2017, which represented 26.7 percent of pretax income, compared to an income tax provision of $8.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, with an effective tax rate of 51.1 percent. The fourth-quarter income tax benefit was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that resulted in a $7.8 million tax benefit for the fourth quarter, primarily due to the revaluing of our net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the recently enacted 21% federal corporate tax rate. This income tax benefit was partially offset by our inability to utilize losses experienced in certain Canadian operations.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, net income was $13.6 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, compared to $7.8 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the same period of 2016. Fourth quarter 2017 EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $20.6 million, or 5.5 percent of revenues, compared to $26.1 million, or 7.6 percent of revenues, in the fourth-quarter of 2016.\nFull Year\nMYR reported record revenues of $1.403 billion for the full year of 2017, an increase of $260.8 million, or 22.8 percent, compared to $1.142 billion for the full year of 2016. Specifically, the T&D segment reported revenues of $879.4 million, an increase of $60.4 million, or 7.4 percent, from the full year of 2016, primarily due to higher revenue from large transmission projects and an increase in distribution projects. The C&I segment reported full year of 2017 revenues of $523.9 million, an increase of $200.4 million, or 62.0 percent, from the full year 2016, primarily due to increased spending from existing customers and the WPE acquisition in late 2016 and organic expansion into new markets.\nConsolidated gross profit was $125.0 million in the full year of 2017, compared to $134.7 million in the full year of 2016. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to lower overall gross margin, partially offset by higher revenue. Gross margin decreased to 8.9 percent for the full year of 2017 from 11.8 percent for the full year of 2016. The decline in our gross margin was largely due to write-downs on three projects. Two projects in the Midwest U.S. were significantly impacted by weather resulting in unanticipated costs associated with right-of-way access, lower productivity and increased road damage and repair requirements. As a result, we wrote down $4.8 million for these projects in 2017. One T&D project in Canada experienced cost impacts mainly associated with project delays and schedule extensions. Although we are working with our client to recover these costs, we have not recognized all of the revenues relating to various pending project claims and change orders, which resulted in write-downs on this project of $4.4 million. Margins were also negatively impacted from significant revenue on a large transmission project that had lower than average margins due to a high mix of material and subcontractor costs and lower than average margin on a certain distribution project, as well as costs associated with organic and acquisition growth. In addition, during 2017 we had a higher mix of revenue in our C&I segment and distribution work, as compared to transmission work, which generally carries a higher margin. These impacts were partially offset by settlements related to previously unrecognized revenues on a project claim and pending change orders. Changes in estimates of gross profit on certain projects, including those discussed above, resulted in a gross margin decreases of 0.7 percent and 0.2 percent for the full years of 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nSG&A increased to $98.6 million in the full year of 2017, from $96.4 million in the full year of 2016. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to $6.8 million of costs associated with our expansion into new geographic markets and higher payroll costs to support operations, largely offset by lower bonus and profit sharing costs. Additionally, $1.0 million of costs associated with activist investor activities were incurred in full year of 2016. As a percentage of revenues, SG&A decreased to 7.0 percent for the full year of 2017 from 8.4 percent for the full year of 2016.\nThe income tax provision was $3.5 million for the full year of 2017 with an effective tax rate of 14.1 percent, compared to a provision of $16.9 million for the full year of 2016 with an effective tax rate of 44.1 percent. The decrease in the tax rate in the full year of 2017 was primarily caused by the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the recently enacted 21% federal corporate tax rate and excess tax benefits of approximately $0.8 million pertaining to the vesting of stock awards and the exercise of stock options. This was partially offset by our inability to utilize losses experienced in certain Canadian operations.\nFor the full year of 2017, net income was $21.2 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, compared to $21.4 million, or $1.23 per diluted share, for the same period of 2016. Full-year 2017 EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $65.8 million, or 4.7 percent of revenues, compared to $78.8 million, or 6.9 percent of revenues, in the full year of 2016.\nBacklog\nAs of December 31, 2017, MYR's backlog was $679.1 million, which consisted of $333.1 million in the T&D segment and $346.0 million in the C&I segment, and was $22.6 million, or 3.2 percent, lower than the $701.7 million reported at September 30, 2017. T&D backlog increased $19.5 million, or 6.2 percent, from September 30, 2017, while C&I backlog decreased $42.1 million, or 10.8 percent, over the same period. Total backlog at December 31, 2017 decreased $9.7 million, or 1.4 percent, from the $688.8 million reported at December 31, 2016. Our backlog as of December 31, 2017 included $27.6 million, our proportionate share, of unconsolidated joint venture backlog. The December 31, 2017 backlog does not include any amount related to the previously announced Denver Central 70 Project. We expect this project to be added to backlog in the first quarter of 2018.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of December 31, 2017, MYR had $150.1 million of borrowing availability under its credit facility.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement MYR’s financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), MYR uses certain non-GAAP measures. Reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measures of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release can be found at the end of this release. MYR’s definitions of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others. These non-GAAP measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nMYR believes that these non-GAAP measures are useful because they (i) provide both management and investors meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain expenses and benefits that may not be indicative of recurring core business operating results, (ii) permit investors to view MYR’s performance using the same tools that management uses to evaluate MYR’s past performance, reportable business segments and prospects for future performance, (iii) publicly disclose results that are relevant to financial covenants included in MYR’s credit facility and (iv) otherwise provide supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating MYR.\nConference Call\nMYR will host a conference call to discuss its fourth-quarter 2017 results on Thursday, March 8, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. Central time.

These measures are used by management to evaluate our past performance, our prospects for future performance and our ability to comply with certain material covenants as defined within our credit agreement, and to compare our results with those of our peers. In addition, we believe that certain of the measures, such as book value, tangible book value, free cash flow, asset turnover, return on equity and debt leverage are measures that are monitored by sureties, lenders, lessors, suppliers and certain investors. Our calculation of each measure is described in the following notes; our calculation may not be the same as the calculations made by other companies. (2) EBIT, net of taxes is defined as net income plus net interest, less the tax impact of net interest. The tax impact of net interest is computed by multiplying net interest by the effective tax rate. Management uses EBIT, net of taxes, to measure our results exclusive of the impact of financing costs. (3) EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not recognized under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to net cash flows provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA is a component of the debt to EBITDA covenant, as defined in our credit agreement, which we must comply with to avoid potential immediate repayment of amounts borrowed or additional fees to seek relief from our lenders. In addition, management considers EBITDA a useful measure because it eliminates differences which are caused by different capital structures as well as different tax rates and depreciation schedules when comparing our measures to our peers’ measures. (4) EBITDA per diluted share is calculated by dividing EBITDA by the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding for the period. EBITDA per diluted share is not recognized under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to income per diluted share. (5) Free cash flow, which is defined as cash flow provided by operating activities minus cash flow used in purchasing property and equipment, is not recognized under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to net income, cash flow from operations or the change in cash on the balance sheet. Management views free cash flow as a measure of operational performance, liquidity and financial health. (6) Book value per period end share is calculated by dividing total stockholders’ equity at the end of the period by the period end shares outstanding. (7) Tangible book value is calculated by subtracting goodwill and intangible assets at the end of the period from stockholders’ equity at the end of the period. Tangible book value is not recognized under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to book value or stockholders’ equity. (8) Tangible book value per period end share is calculated by dividing tangible book value at the end of the period by the period end number of shares outstanding. Tangible book value per period end share is not recognized under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to income per diluted share. (9) The funded debt to equity ratio is calculated by dividing total funded debt at the end of the period by total stockholders’ equity at the end of the period. (10) Asset turnover is calculated by dividing the current period revenue by total assets at the beginning of the period. (11) Return on assets is calculated by dividing net income for the period by total assets at the beginning of the period. (12) Return on equity is calculated by dividing net income for the period by total stockholders’ equity at the beginning of the period. (13) Period end shares is calculated by adding average common stock equivalents for the quarter to the period end balance of common shares outstanding. Period end shares is not recognized under GAAP and does not purport to be an alternative to diluted shares. Management views period end shares as a better measure of shares outstanding as of the end of the period. (14) Invested capital is calculated by adding net funded debt (total funded debt less cash and marketable securities) to total stockholders’ equity. (15) Return on invested capital is calculated by dividing EBIT, net of taxes, less any dividends, by invested capital at the beginning of the period. Return on invested capital is not recognized under GAAP, and is a key metric used by management to determine our executive compensation.\nSource:MYR Group, Inc.",
