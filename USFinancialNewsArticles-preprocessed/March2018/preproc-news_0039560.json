    "text": "ATLANTA, GA, March 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GOPHER PROTOCOL INC. (OTCQB: GOPH) (\"Gopher\"), a development-stage company which specializes in the creation of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence enabled mobile technologies, effective March 1, 2018 acquired certain assets from ECS Prepaid LLC (“ECS”), including, but not limited to, the processing prepaid platform, servers, POS terminals, customer list, a processing software program and goodwill. The core asset of ECS is its processing software program, which Gopher intends to marry immediately into the prior acquisition of the UGO HUB and the UGO brand of products. Following its September 2017 acquisition of the UGO assets from RWJ Advanced Marketing, Gopher has been focused on integrating these assets into its operations. Gopher intends to upgrade the designated website for the brand, which is currently located at http://www.myugoonline.info/. The coupling of the UGO and ECS assets will allow Gopher to “in house” process all of its PIN and financial products and will eliminate any dependency upon third parties for processing services allowing Gopher to curate and distribute a faster time to market.\nECS PrePaid’s core operating system currently operates over 9,000 terminals in retail locations throughout the United States. These terminals process over 14,000 transactions a day and have capacity to entertain at least three times its current volume, without further software expense. This platform generated approximately $32 million in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 (unaudited), approximately $4.2 million for the month of January 2018 (unaudited) and approximately $4.3 for the month of February 2018 (unaudited).\nIn total, Gopher paid $1.2 million in cash, note and employment signing bonuses, issued 2,000,000 shares of common stock and 3,000,000 warrants to purchase shares of common stock for a period of five years at a fixed exercise price of $1.85 per share.\n“We believe this acquisition will uniquely position Gopher to establish our mesh network and connect with consumers. In addition, it allows us to fill a void in the market created by Pay-Pal’s abrupt termination of their services in November 2017” stated Gopher CEO Greg Bauer.\nAbout ECS Prepaid LLC.\nFormed in 2008, ECS Prepaid LLC. ( www.ecsprepaid.com ) was started and fueled by the desire to create a Prepaid Wireless distribution model built to cater to Independent Sales Organizations servicing the gas station, convenience store market. ECS Prepaid is a two time “INC 500 Fastest Growing Companies” in the US, with a high ranking of 64th.\nStarting with just a few hundred direct retail locations, ECS Prepaid quickly grew its customer base by providing one of the most comprehensive terminal solution available. Today ECS Prepaid supports over 100 independent agents while powering roughly 9,000 retail locations across the United States.\nThe ECS Prepaid software platform provides the ability to bring a variety of services to even the smallest retailer. Products currently available include: Prepaid Wireless, SIM Activations, International Top Up, Private Label Gift Cards, Electronic Check Processing, Customer Loyalty and Rewards programs.\nAbout Gopher Protocol Inc.\nGopher Protocol Inc.
