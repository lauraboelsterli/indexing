    "text": "March 28, 2018 / 5:51 AM / Updated 2 minutes ago IDBI Bank discloses fraud of $119 million, shares fall Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - IDBI Bank Ltd said on Tuesday fraudulent loans of 7.72 billion rupees ($118.8 million) were issued from five of its branches in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, sending its shares lower on Wednesday. \nSome of the loans, which were issued during fiscal years 2009-2013 for fish farming businesses, were obtained against fake lease documents of non-existent fish ponds and by inflating the value of collateral, the company said here \nThe company found major lapses in processing and disbursing the loans by two of its officials. The lender dismissed one of the officials, while the other official had already retired, it said. \nThe Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), has registered cases for two of the five complaints, relating to branches at Basheerbagh and Guntur, the company said. \nThe bank said earlier on Tuesday it initiated a quality assurance audit, expected to be completed by April. \nIDBI shares fell as much as 3.5 percent to 73.6 rupees by 0512 GMT, while the index for public sector lenders Nifty PSU Bank index dropped as much as 1.8 percent. \n($1 = 65.0000 rupees)",
