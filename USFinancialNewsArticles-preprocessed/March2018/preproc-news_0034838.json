(http://reut.rs/2pn8btD)\nThe scrutiny presents a new threat to Facebook's reputation, which is already under attack over Russians' use of Facebook tools to sway American voters with \"fake news\" posts before and after the 2016 U.S. elections.\nFacebook said on Monday it had hired a digital forensics firm Stroz Friedberg, to carry out a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica, which had agreed to comply and to give the forensics firm complete access to their servers and systems.\nCambridge Analytica said it strongly denies the claims, according to a statement on its website.\nFacebook was already facing new calls on Saturday for regulation from U.S. Congress and questions about personal data safeguards after the reports in the New York Times and London's Observer over the weekend.\n\"It's clear these platforms can't police themselves,\" Democratic U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar tweeted.\nOn Monday, Republican Senator John Kennedy joined Klobuchar in calling on Zuckerberg to testify before Congress, and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden sent a letter to Zuckerberg asking about company policies for sharing user data with third parties.\nWyden, an influential senator on technology issues, asked how many times during the past ten years Facebook was aware of third parties collecting or processing data in violation of the company's platform policies, among several other questions. Facebook usually sends lawyers to testify to Congress, or allows trade organizations to represent it and other technology companies in front of lawmakers.\nFacebook and its rivals, including Twitter and YouTube, have largely withstood political pressure stemming from Russia's manipulation of their services. While they have taken voluntary steps to restrict foreign interference and combat false news, they have not been forced by law or regulation to make changes, and legislation on the issue has stalled.\nIt was not clear whether Republicans who hold congressional committee gavels would announce hearings related to Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. But the calls reflected mounting bipartisan concern in Washington over whether internet firms are fair trustees of the massive amounts of user data they collect.\nOn Monday, the Senate was expected to move forward with a bill that would chip away at the internet industrys legal shield, a decades-old law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, with a bill intended to address online sex trafficking. The measure has already passed the House of Representatives and was expected to soon become law. Facebook said on Friday that it had learned in 2015 that a Cambridge University psychology professor had lied to the company and violated its policies by passing data to Cambridge Analytica from a psychology testing app he had built.\nFacebook said it suspended the firms and researchers involved. It also said the data had been misused but not stolen, because users gave permission.\nFacebook shares fell 7 percent at $172.17, dragging the S&P 500 technology sector down 2.6 percent and weighing on the overall U.S. equity market.\nFears of increased regulation also weighed on shares of Twitter Inc Google parent Alphabet Inc and Snapchat parent Snap Inc.\n\"(Tech companies) are going to get a lot more scrutiny over what data they are collecting and how they are using it,\" said Shawn Cruz, senior trading specialist at TD Ameritrade in Chicago.\n'VERY CONCERNING'\nA spokesman for British Prime Minister Theresa May said the allegations were \"clearly very concerning ... It is essential that people can have confidence that their personal data will be protected and used in an appropriate way.\"\nBritain's Information Commissioner's Office said it would consider the potential new evidence as part its separate civil and criminal probe into whether Facebook user data had been abused in British elections. \"It's time for Mark Zuckerberg to stop hiding behind his Facebook page,\" UK Parliamentary committee chairman and Conservative lawmaker Damian Collins said in a statement.\nThe head of the European Parliament said EU lawmakers will investigate whether data misuse had taken place, calling the allegations an unacceptable violation of citizens' privacy rights.\n(Reporting by Dustin Volz and Munsif Vengattil Additional reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak and Sruthi Shankar Writing by Susan Thomas Editing by Nick Zieminski)",
