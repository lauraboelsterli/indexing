    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., March 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Netlist, Inc. (Nasdaq: NLST) today reported financial results for the fiscal year and fourth quarter ended December 30, 2017.\nRevenues for the year ended December 30, 2017 were $38.3 million, compared to revenues of $19.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 95%. Gross profit for the year ended December 30, 2017 was $2.5 million, or 6.4% of revenues, compared to a gross profit of $7.4 million, or 37.6% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The year ended December 31, 2016 included $6.9 million in non-recurring engineering revenues related to our joint development arrangement with Samsung Electronics.\nGAAP net loss for the year ended December 30, 2017 was ($13.4) million, or ($0.20) loss per share, compared to a net loss in the prior year period of ($11.2) million, or ($0.21) loss per share. These results include stock-based compensation expense of $1.2 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\nRevenues for the fourth quarter ended December 30, 2017 were $8.5 million, compared to revenues of $5.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit for the quarter ended December 30, 2017 was $0.4 million, or 4.8% of revenues, compared to a gross profit of $0.3 million, or 5.0% of revenues, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nGAAP net loss for the fourth quarter ended December 30, 2017 was ($3.1) million, or ($0.04) loss per share, compared to a net loss in the prior year period of ($3.9) million, or ($0.06) loss per share. These results include stock-based compensation expense of $0.3 million and $0.4 million for the quarters ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\nAs of December 30, 2017, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash were $9.5 million, total assets were $18.8 million, working capital was $7.7 million, total debt, net of debt discount and accrued interest, was $16.8 million, and stockholders' deficit was ($5.3) million.\n\"In 2017 we nearly doubled our revenues, made further progress in the commercialization of HybriDIMM™ and expanded our intellectual property with the issuance of important new patents. This year, we are committed to growing the NV/EV business and licensing our intellectual property amid an exploding high-performance memory market,\" said C.K. Hong, Netlist's Chief Executive Officer.\nAdjusted EBITDA loss was ($11.4) million for the year ended December 30, 2017, compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of ($9.3) million for the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA (loss) was ($2.6) million for the fourth quarter ended December 30, 2017, compared to adjusted EBITDA (loss) of ($3.7) million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Non-GAAP financial measures are described below under \"Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,\" and are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net loss, below under \"Unaudited Schedule Reconciling GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.\"\nConference Call Information\nC.K. Hong, Chief Executive Officer, and Gail Sasaki, Chief Financial Officer, will host an investor conference call today, March 27, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to review Netlist's results for the full year and fourth quarter ended December 30, 2017. The dial-in number for the call is 1-412-317-5443. The live webcast and archived replay of the call can be accessed for 90 days in the Investors section of Netlist's website at www.netlist.com .\nNote Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nCertain of the data included in this press release, including EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, are non-GAAP financial measures. Netlist believes this information is useful to investors because it provides a basis for measuring the operating performance of Netlist's business excluding certain items that it believes are not attributable to or reflective of its core operating results. Netlist defines EBITDA as net loss calculated and presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"), plus interest expense, net, plus provisions for income taxes, and plus depreciation and amortization; and Netlist defines adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense and plus (minus) other expense (income), net. Netlist expects to continue to incur expenses similar to the line items added to or subtracted from net loss to calculate EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA; accordingly, the exclusion of these items in the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that these items are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Netlist's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures along with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure net loss in evaluating Netlist's operating performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in conformity with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as reported by Netlist may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.\nAbout Netlist\nNetlist provides high-performance modular memory subsystems to customers in diverse industries that require enterprise and storage class memory solutions to empower critical business decisions.
