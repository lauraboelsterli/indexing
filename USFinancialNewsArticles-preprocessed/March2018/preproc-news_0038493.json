    "text": "NEW YORK, March 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nWillingness of Patients to Opt for Treatments in Developed Regions to Boost Revenue Growth of the Global Osteoarthritis Treatment Market\nPersistence Market Research (PMR) has published a new research report on the osteoarthritis treatment market titled \" Osteoarthritis Treatment Market: Global Industry Analysis (2012-2016) and Forecast (2017-2025).\" An alarming rise in the number of osteoarthritis cases is the result of a growing geriatric population worldwide.\n(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20161114/438683LOGO )\nIn order to cater to the needs of the rapidly increasing geriatric population as well as the female population - given that osteoarthritis prevails mostly among these groups - the manufacturers of osteoarthritis drugs are focusing on research and development to be able to develop better and reliable drugs.\nAs this disease is not treatable, the market is an ever growing one. In this run, the leading companies are also collaborating with other big companies in order to use their formulas and production equipment.\nGlobal Osteoarthritis Treatment Market Research Report Overview @ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/osteoarthritis-market.asp\nFor instance, in September 2016, Pfizer Inc. completed the acquisition of Medivation, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of medically innovative therapies to treat serious diseases that have limited treatment options. In this regard, the company also acquired the commercialization and development rights of the late stage small molecules anti-infective business, mainly outside the U.S. from AstraZeneca.\nOther companies operating in the market are Johnson & Johnson Services, Inc., Novartis AG, GlaxoSmithKline plc. Abbott Laboratories, and Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc., among others.\nAccording to the report, the global osteoarthritis treatment market is expected to register a CAGR of 4.8% from 2017 to 2025. In 2017, the market was valued at US$ 7,969.7 Mn and is expected to rise to a valuation of US$ 11,618.6 Mn by the end of 2025.\nRequest Sample Report@ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/samples/4458\nGrowing Geriatric Population and Rising Prevalence of Disease to Trigger Adoption\nThe prevalence of osteoarthritis is increasing across the globe and it is the major cause of disability, especially among the ageing population. Women are more likely to be affected than men and the prevalence rate progresses with age.\nIncreasing awareness regarding the risk factors associated with osteoarthritis (such as obesity) among the general population due to government action plans to control the disease is expected to boost the growth of the osteoarthritis treatment market.\nHowever, improvement in healthcare policies in various countries such as the U.S. has resulted in enhanced affordability for various diagnostic and treatment services, which in turn has increased the life expectancy of people. Other dynamics such as the availability of alternative medicines are expected to boost the growth of the market.\nDownload and View Report TOC, Figures and Tables @ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/osteoarthritis-market/toc\nNon-availability of Permanent Cure for Osteoarthritis to Restrict Market Growth\nPresently, there is no cure of osteoarthritis but the treatment is aimed to manage the symptoms. Aspects such as lack of awareness regarding risk factors and symptoms of osteoarthritis is expected to restrain the growth of the osteoarthritis treatment market. There is no simple diagnosis available for osteoarthritis.\nDiagnosis is based on a variable combination of patient reported symptoms and imaging of the joint. Mostly x-ray is used to diagnose osteoarthritis, but it often does not correlate with other symptoms of osteoarthritis including joint pain.\nGet full Report Now https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/checkout/4458\nPersistence Market Research Overview\nPersistence Market Research (PMR) is a third-platform research firm.
