    "text": "Atlanta, Ga., March 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nJim Byrnes, Blue Ridge CEO\nBlue Ridge CEO Jim Byrnes has been named a 2018 Food Logistics Champion as one of the “Rock Stars of the Supply Chain.” Jim will be profiled with the other honorees in the March 2018 issue of Food Logistics , as well as online at www.foodlogistics.com .\nBlue Ridge supply chain solutions help food distributors reduce costs and assure product availability to customers without creating a costly inventory surplus. Leading progressive food and beverage distributors including Georgia Crown Distributing Company, Hardies Fresh Foods, Martignetti, Rhee Brothers, Suisan Company and United Distributors all joined the Blue Ridge customer roster in 2017.\n“Blue Ridge is committing to helping our food distribution customers create a more foreseeable future—to spot and plan for changes in customer demand before they happen,” said Byrnes.\nSuisan Company, a broadline food distributor located in Hilo, Hawaii selected Blue Ridge to help improve its service levels:\n“We looked at several demand forecasting systems before selecting Blue Ridge. Blue Ridge had the most complete solution to support our business needs, and to help us achieve our service level goals. Our team is excited and looking forward to utilizing the new software.” Mark Oishi, Director of Purchasing, Suisan Company, Ltd.\nThe cloud-based Blue Ridge supply chain platform is purpose-built for the retail and distribution industries. The all-in-one system unifies demand and supply planning, replenishment, inventory optimization, and analytics into one system, providing visibility into the entire supply chain.\nThe Food Logistics Champions: Rock Stars of the Supply Chain recognizes influential individuals in the food industry whose achievements, hard work, and vision have shaped and attained milestones in safety, efficiency, productivity and innovation through the global food supply chain.\nBlue Ridge will host BLUEPrint 2018 in Atlanta on April 22 –24 at the Omni Hotel at The Battery Atlanta™. BLUEPrint is a hands-on annual conference for supply chain leaders, managers and users of Blue Ridge solutions.\nAbout Blue Ridge\nBlue Ridge supply chain solutions are the most accurate way for retailers and distributors to spot changes in customer demand before they happen. Traditional forecasting and planning solutions weren’t designed to keep up with today’s increasingly unpredictable consumer behavior. In a world where the only constant is change, Blue Ridge provides more certainty, more speed, and more assurance – so companies can see the why behind the buy and respond faster to the unexpected. That’s why Blue Ridge is recognized as a Leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Supply Chain Planning . And its why major retailers and distributors rely on Blue Ridge for a more foreseeable future.
