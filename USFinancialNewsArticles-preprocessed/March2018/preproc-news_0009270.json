    "text": "St.Cloud, Minnesota, March 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- For years as a school nurse, Rainya Strack was often the bearer of bad news to parents of children with head lice. “I was the one who sent home the dreaded lice letters and made the phone calls to parents,” she said. “Very few parents take this news calmly, and this was before we knew that over-the-counter medications didn’t work because head lice had become resistant to the pesticides they use.”\nRainya was thrilled to discover Lice Clinics of America and the FDA-cleared AirAllé medical device that the clinics use to kill live lice and more than 99 percent of eggs in a single treatment and recently relocated to 3700 West Division Street.\nLice Clinics of America – St. Cloud provides screening, diagnosis, and treatment for people infested with head lice using the AirAllé device. It kills head lice and lice eggs using controlled heated air. No pesticides are used, and the AirAllé has successfully treated more than 350,000 cases of head lice.\n“We use a 3-step process, which includes the AirAlle treatment,” Rainya said. “The entire process takes 60-90 minutes. That's it. It is safe, highly effective, and fast with no follow up needed, including a 30-day guarantee.”\nThe St. Cloud clinic is located at 3700 West Division Street, Suite 105, and is open seven days per week by appointment.\nWith more than 300 clinics in 34 countries, Lice Clinics of America ( www.LiceClinicsOfAmerica.com ) is the largest network of professional head-lice-treatment centers in the world. Lice Clinics of America and AirAllé ( www.airalle.com ) are brands owned by Larada Sciences, Inc., which is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.\nAttachment:\nA photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/9d613b36-ed40-4bbc-874b-63de339ec67e\nRainya Strack Lice Clinics of America 320 423 1652 info@liceclinicstcloud.com\nSource:Lice Clinicsof America",
