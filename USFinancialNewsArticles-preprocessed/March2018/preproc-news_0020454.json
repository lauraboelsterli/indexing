    "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo., March 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- H&R Block, Inc. (NYSE:HRB) today released U.S. tax return volume through February 28 and its financial results for the fiscal 2018 third quarter ended January 31, 2018. The company normally reports a fiscal third quarter loss due to the seasonality of its tax business.\nTax Season and Fiscal Third Quarter Highlights 1\nH&R Block grows total U.S. returns through February 28. Company reiterates financial outlook for full year. Fiscal third quarter revenues increased $37 million, or 8%, to $488 million primarily due to increased return volumes in both Assisted and DIY tax preparation businesses. Loss per share from continuing operations increased $0.67, from $0.49 to $1.16, solely due to changes in the company's effective tax rate resulting from the recently enacted federal corporate tax legislation. The negative impact from these corporate tax rate changes is unique to the company's fiscal third quarter, as the impact will be favorable on a full fiscal year basis.\nTax Season Results 2\nH&R Block total U.S. return volume increased 3.4% through February 28, with Assisted returns increasing 0.7% and DIY returns increasing 8.2%. Positive results in the Assisted business were due to the success of early-season promotions including the company's Refund Advance no-interest loan and Free Federal 1040EZ offer. In DIY, continued product improvements, enhanced partnerships, and the H&R Block More Zero ® promotion led to the strong performance.\nCEO Perspective\n\"I'm proud of what we have accomplished so far this tax season, with strong results in both the Assisted and DIY tax preparation categories,\" said Jeff Jones, H&R Block's president and chief executive officer. \"As we look to the second half of the tax season, we'll continue to focus on execution as we leverage our products, partnerships and marketing to deliver on our financial outlook.\"\nFiscal 2018 Third Quarter Results From Continuing Operations\n(in millions, except EPS) Fiscal Year 2018 Fiscal Year 2017 Revenue $ 488 $ 452 Pretax Loss $ (121 ) $ (151 ) Net Loss $ (243 ) $ (101 ) Weighted-Avg. Shares - Diluted 209.1 207.9 EPS 3 $ (1.16 ) $ (0.49 ) EBITDA 4 $ (48 ) $ (79 ) Key Financial Metrics\nTotal revenues increased $37 million, or 8%, to $488 million primarily due to increased return volumes. Total operating expenses increased $9 million, or 2%, to $586 million primarily due to increases in compensation costs, partially offset by lower marketing and advertising expenses. Pretax loss decreased $30 million to $121 million. Loss per share from continuing operations increased $0.67, from $0.49 to $1.16, solely due to changes in the company's effective tax rate resulting from the recently enacted federal corporate tax legislation. The negative impact from these corporate tax rate changes is unique to the company's fiscal third quarter, as the impact will be favorable on a full fiscal year basis. The company expects its fiscal year effective tax rate to be 6%-9%, which is an update to the anticipated annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 disclosed in the company's Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 22, 2018.\nCFO Perspective\n\"We are pleased with our performance during the first half of the tax season, which was in line with our expectations,\" said Tony Bowen, H&R Block's chief financial officer. \"Our expectations for revenue growth and margin are unchanged from the outlook we provided in December.\"\nDividends\nAs previously announced, a quarterly cash dividend of $0.24 per share is payable on April 2, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 13, 2018. H&R Block has paid quarterly dividends consecutively since the company went public in 1962.\nDiscontinued Operations\nDuring the fiscal quarter, Sand Canyon Corporation made payments of $4.5 million pursuant to a settlement agreement entered into in fiscal 2016. The full amount of the payments had been previously accrued by the company.

Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Because these measures are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and are susceptible to varying calculations, they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures for other companies.\nWe consider our non-GAAP financial measures to be performance measures and a useful metric for management and investors to evaluate and compare the ongoing operating performance of our business.\nWe may consider whether significant items that arise in the future should be excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures.\nWe measure the performance of our business using a variety of metrics, including EBITDA from continuing operations. We also use EBITDA from continuing operations and pretax income of continuing operations, each subject to permitted adjustments, as performance metrics in incentive compensation calculations for our employees.\nSource:HRB Tax Group, Inc.",
