(NASDAQ:VRNT), a global leader in Actionable Intelligence ® solutions and value-added services, today announced results for the three months and year ended January 31, 2018.\nFinancial Highlights\nBelow is selected unaudited financial information for the three months and year ended January 31, 2018 prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and not in accordance with GAAP (“non-GAAP”).\nThree Months Ended January 31, 2018 - GAAP Three Months Ended January 31, 2018 - Non-GAAP Revenue: $318.7 million (1) Revenue: $322.7 million (1) Operating income: $36.3 million Operating income: $82.0 million Diluted net income per share: $0.26 Diluted net income per share: $1.05 Year Ended January 31, 2018 - GAAP Year Ended January 31, 2018 - Non-GAAP Revenue: $1,135.2 million (1) Revenue: $1,150.5 million (1) Operating income: $48.6 million Operating income: $226.1 million Net loss per share: ($0.10) Diluted net income per share: $2.81 (1) Please refer to Table 6 for constant currency revenue information, and \"Supplemental Information about Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" at the end of this press release for more information.\nCEO Commentary\n“The momentum we experienced throughout the year continued in Q4 and we are pleased to have finished the year strong. We believe our overachievement reflects on-going demand for actionable intelligence solutions and the successful execution of our growth strategy. The investments and changes we have made in the business position us well for sustained long-term growth and we are again raising our guidance for the current year,” said Dan Bodner, Verint CEO and President.\nFinancial Outlook\nWe are increasing our non-GAAP outlook for both revenue and EPS for the year ending January 31, 2019 is as follows:\nSegment Revenue Outlook: In our Customer Engagement segment, we expect mid-single digit revenue growth. In our Cyber Intelligence segment, we expect 10% revenue growth. Total Revenue and EPS outlook: Based on the above, we expect total revenue of $1.230 billion with a range of +/- 2% and diluted earnings per share of $3.09 at the midpoint.\nOur non-GAAP outlook for the year ending January 31, 2019 excludes the following GAAP measures which we are able to quantify with reasonable certainty:\nAmortization of intangible assets of approximately $54 million. Amortization of discount on convertible notes of approximately $12 million.\nOur non-GAAP outlook for the year ending January 31, 2019 excludes the following GAAP measures for which we are able to provide a range of probable significance:\nRevenue adjustments related to completed acquisitions are expected to be between approximately $9 million and $10 million for the year ending January 31, 2019. Stock-based compensation is expected to be between approximately $62 million and $67 million for the year ending January 31, 2019, assuming market prices for our common stock approximately consistent with current levels.\nOur non-GAAP outlook does not include the potential impact of any in-process business acquisitions that may close after the date hereof, and, unless otherwise specified, reflects foreign currency exchange rates approximately consistent with current rates.\nWe are unable, without unreasonable efforts, to provide a reconciliation for other GAAP measures which are excluded from our non-GAAP outlook, including the impact of future business acquisitions or acquisition expenses, future restructuring expenses, and non-GAAP income tax adjustments due to the level of unpredictability and uncertainty associated with these items. For these same reasons, we are unable to assess the probable significance of these excluded items. While historical results may not be indicative of future results, actual amounts for the three months and year ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 for the GAAP measures excluded from our non-GAAP outlook appear in Table 3 to this press release.\nConference Call Information\nWe will conduct a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss our results for the three months and year ended January 31, 2018 and outlook. An online, real-time webcast of the conference call will be available on our website at www.verint.com .

Verint Systems Inc. and Subsidiaries\nSupplemental Information About Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains non-GAAP financial measures, consisting of non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin, non-GAAP operating income and operating margin, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP provision (benefit) for income taxes and non-GAAP effective income tax rate, non-GAAP net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc., non-GAAP net income per common share attributable to Verint Systems Inc., adjusted EBITDA, net debt, constant currency measures and estimated non-GAAP fully allocated operating margins. Tables 2 and 3 include a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure for completed periods presented in this press release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures, used in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business by:\nfacilitating the comparison of our financial results and business trends between periods, including by excluding certain items that either can vary significantly in amount and frequency, are based upon subjective assumptions, or in certain cases are unplanned for or difficult to forecast, facilitating the comparison of our financial results and business trends with other technology companies who publish similar non-GAAP measures, and allowing investors to see and understand key supplementary metrics used by our management to run our business, including for budgeting and forecasting, resource allocation, and compensation matters.\nWe also make these non-GAAP financial measures available because a number of our investors have informed us that they find this supplemental information useful.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation as substitutes for, or superior to, comparable GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures we present have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP, and these non-GAAP financial measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures do not represent discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business, and we may in the future incur expenses similar to or in addition to the adjustments made in these non-GAAP financial measures. Other companies may calculate similar non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are calculated by making the following adjustments to our GAAP financial measures:\nRevenue adjustments related to acquisitions. We exclude from our non-GAAP revenue the impact of fair value adjustments required under GAAP relating to acquired customer support contracts, which would have otherwise been recognized on a stand-alone basis. We believe that it is useful for investors to understand the total amount of revenue that we and the acquired company would have recognized on a stand-alone basis under GAAP, absent the accounting adjustment associated with the business acquisition. Our non-GAAP revenue also reflects certain adjustments from aligning an acquired company’s revenue recognition policies to our policies. We believe that our non-GAAP revenue measure helps management and investors understand our revenue trends and serves as a useful measure of ongoing business performance.\nAmortization of acquired technology and other acquired intangible assets. When we acquire an entity, we are required under GAAP to record the fair values of the intangible assets of the acquired entity and amortize those assets over their useful lives. We exclude the amortization of acquired intangible assets, including acquired technology, from our non-GAAP financial measures because they are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions. We also exclude these amounts to provide easier comparability of pre- and post-acquisition operating results.\nStock-based compensation expenses. We exclude stock-based compensation expenses related to restricted stock awards, stock bonus programs, bonus share programs, and other stock-based awards from our non-GAAP financial measures. We evaluate our performance both with and without these measures because stock-based compensation is typically a non-cash expense and can vary significantly over time based on the timing, size and nature of awards granted, and is influenced in part by certain factors which are generally beyond our control, such as the volatility of the price of our common stock. In addition, measurement of stock-based compensation is subject to varying valuation methodologies and subjective assumptions, and therefore we believe that excluding stock-based compensation from our non-GAAP financial measures allows for meaningful comparisons of our current operating results to our historical operating results and to other companies in our industry.\nUnrealized gains and losses on certain derivatives, net. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures unrealized gains and losses on certain foreign currency derivatives which are not designated as hedges under accounting guidance. We exclude unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivatives that serve as economic hedges against variability in the cash flows of recognized assets or liabilities, or of forecasted transactions. These contracts, if designated as hedges under accounting guidance, would be considered “cash flow” hedges. These unrealized gains and losses are excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures because they are non-cash transactions which are highly variable from period to period. Upon settlement of these foreign currency derivatives, any realized gain or loss is included in our non-GAAP financial measures.\nAmortization of convertible note discount. Our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the amortization of the imputed discount on our convertible notes. Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion are required to be bifurcated into separate liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components in a manner that reflects the issuer’s assumed non-convertible debt borrowing rate. For GAAP purposes, we are required to recognize imputed interest expense on the difference between our assumed non-convertible debt borrowing rate and the coupon rate on our $400.0 million of 1.50% convertible notes. This difference is excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures because we believe that this expense is based upon subjective assumptions and does not reflect the cash cost of our convertible debt.\nLosses and expenses on early retirements or modifications of debt. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures losses on early retirements of debt attributable to refinancing or repaying our debt, and expenses incurred to modify debt terms, because we believe they are not reflective of our ongoing operations.\nAcquisition Expenses, net. In connection with acquisition activity (including with respect to acquisitions that are not consummated), we incur expenses, including legal, accounting, and other professional fees, integration costs, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations, and other costs. Integration costs may consist of information technology expenses as systems are integrated across the combined entity, consulting expenses, marketing expenses, and professional fees, as well as non-cash charges to write-off or impair the value of redundant assets. We exclude these expenses from our non-GAAP financial measures because they are unpredictable, can vary based on the size and complexity of each transaction, and are unrelated to our continuing operations or to the continuing operations of the acquired businesses.\nRestructuring Expenses. We exclude restructuring expenses from our non-GAAP financial measures, which include employee termination costs, facility exit costs, certain professional fees, asset impairment charges, and other costs directly associated with resource realignments incurred in reaction to changing strategies or business conditions. All of these costs can vary significantly in amount and frequency based on the nature of the actions as well as the changing needs of our business and we believe that excluding them provides easier comparability of pre- and post-restructuring operating results.\nImpairment Charges and Other Adjustments. We exclude from our non-GAAP financial measures asset impairment charges (other than those already included within restructuring or acquisition activity), rent expense for redundant facilities, gains or losses on sales of property, and certain professional fees unrelated to our ongoing operations, all of which are unusual in nature and can vary significantly in amount and frequency.\nNon-GAAP income tax adjustments. We exclude our GAAP provision (benefit) for income taxes from our non-GAAP measures of net income attributable to Verint Systems Inc., and instead include a non-GAAP provision for income taxes, determined by applying a non-GAAP effective income tax rate to our income before provision for income taxes, as adjusted for the non-GAAP items described above. The non-GAAP effective income tax rate is generally based upon the income taxes we expect to pay in the reporting year. We adjust our non-GAAP effective income tax rate to exclude current-year tax payments or refunds associated with prior-year income tax returns and related amendments which were significantly delayed as a result of our previous extended filing delay. Our GAAP effective income tax rate can vary significantly from year to year as a result of tax law changes, settlements with tax authorities, changes in the geographic mix of earnings including acquisition activity, changes in the projected realizability of deferred tax assets, and other unusual or period-specific events, all of which can vary in size and frequency. We believe that our non-GAAP effective income tax rate removes much of this variability and facilitates meaningful comparisons of operating results across periods. Our non-GAAP effective income tax rate for the year ended January 31, 2018 is 11.5%, and was 8.8% for the year ended January 31, 2017. We evaluate our non-GAAP effective income tax rate on an ongoing basis and it can change from time to time. Our non-GAAP income tax rate can differ materially from our GAAP effective income tax rate.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure defined as net income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, revenue adjustments related to acquisitions, restructuring expenses, acquisition expenses, and other expenses excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures as described above. We believe that adjusted EBITDA is also commonly used by investors to evaluate operating performance between competitors because it helps reduce variability caused by differences in capital structures, income taxes, stock-based compensation accounting policies, and depreciation and amortization policies. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by credit rating agencies, lenders, and other parties to evaluate our creditworthiness.\nNet Debt\nNet Debt is a non-GAAP measure defined as the sum of long-term and short-term debt on our consolidated balance sheet, excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs, less the sum of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and bank time deposits, and short-term investments. We use this non-GAAP financial measure to help evaluate our capital structure, financial leverage, and our ability to reduce debt and to fund investing and financing activities, and believe that it provides useful information to investors.\nSupplemental Information About Constant Currency\nBecause we operate on a global basis and transact business in many currencies, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our consolidated U.S. dollar operating results. To facilitate the assessment of our performance excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we calculate our GAAP and non-GAAP revenue, cost of revenue, and operating expenses on both an as-reported basis and a constant currency basis, allowing for comparison of results between periods as if foreign currency exchange rates had remained constant. We perform our constant currency calculations by translating current-period foreign currency results into U.S. dollars using prior-period average foreign currency exchange rates or hedge rates, as applicable, rather than current period exchange rates. We believe that constant currency measures, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, facilitate the assessment of underlying business trends.\nUnless otherwise indicated, our financial outlook for revenue, operating margin, and diluted earnings per share, which is provided on a non-GAAP basis, reflects foreign currency exchange rates approximately consistent with rates in effect when the outlook is provided.\nWe also incur foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the revaluation and settlement of monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the entity’s functional currency. We periodically report our historical non-GAAP diluted net income per share both inclusive and exclusive of these net foreign exchange gains or losses. Our financial outlook for diluted earnings per share includes net foreign exchange gains or losses incurred to date, if any, but does not include potential future gains or losses.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180328006113/en/\nInvestor Relations\nVerint Systems Inc.\nAlan Roden, (631) 962-9304\nalan.roden@verint.com\nSource: Verint® Systems Inc.",
