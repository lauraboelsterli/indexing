    "text": "Fiscal 2018 Third Quarter Highlights\nNet sales of $83.9 million, a decrease of 2.0% year over year Gross margin expanded 300 basis points year over year to 54.2% GAAP EPS of $0.37; Adjusted EPS of $0.25 per share Announced the launch of a wireless ultrasound device FDA granted Breakthrough designation to NanoKnife ® System for the treatment of Stage III pancreatic cancer\nLATHAM, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AngioDynamics, Inc. (NASDAQ: ANGO), a leading provider of innovative, minimally invasive medical devices for vascular access, peripheral vascular disease, surgery and oncology, today announced financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, which ended February 28, 2018.\n“Our third quarter results demonstrate continued execution against our operational goals as evidenced by meaningful gross margin expansion and strong profitability. Revenue growth remains negatively impacted by competitive headwinds in our Venous and PICCs product lines, but we continue to believe that our ongoing portfolio evaluation and reshaping efforts will drive long-term sustainable top-line growth,” commented Jim Clemmer, President and Chief Executive Officer of AngioDynamics, Inc. “We remain committed to creating value through both organic efforts and M&A as we continue transforming AngioDynamics into a dynamic leader in our industry.”\nThird Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nNet sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $83.9 million, a decrease of 2.0%, compared to $85.6 million a year ago, primarily related to declines in the Company’s Venous Insufficiency business, as well as a negative year-over-year comparison related to the RFA product line, which was discontinued in Japan. Japanese RFA sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 were $1.7 million.\nCurrency did not have a significant impact on the Company’s sales in the quarter.\nPeripheral Vascular net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $48.5 million, a decrease of 0.8% from $48.9 million a year ago, as growth in the Fluid Management, AngioVac, and Angiographic Catheter product lines was offset by declines in the Venous Insufficiency business. Vascular Access net sales were $23.3 million, a decrease of 1.7% from $23.7 million a year ago, as growth in Midlines and other BioFlo related products was more than offset by declines in PICCs. Oncology/Surgery net sales were $12.1 million, a decrease of 7.2% from $13.0 million a year ago, as lower sales related to the discontinued RFA product noted above were only partially offset by mid-teens growth in sales of both NanoKnife and the Solero ® Microwave Tissue Ablation System.\nU.S. net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $65.8 million, a decrease of 2.8% from $67.7 million a year ago, primarily due to declines in the Venous, PICCs, and RFA businesses. International net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $18.1 million, an increase of 0.7% from $17.9 million a year ago, primarily due to consistent performance across each of the business units, partially offset by the decrease in sales of our discontinued RFA product line in Japan.\nGross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 expanded 300 basis points to 54.2% from 51.2% a year ago largely as a result of ongoing operational improvements, recently completed facility consolidations, and the expiration of a royalty arrangement in the second quarter of this fiscal year.\nThe Company recorded net income of $14.0 million, or $0.37 per share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. This compares to net income of $2.9 million, or $0.08 per share, a year ago. The improvement in net income was primarily attributable to the re-measurement of deferred taxes pursuant to the U.S. Tax Reform, resulting in a tax benefit of $9.9 million, compared to a prior-year tax expense of $1.7 million.\nExcluding the items shown in the non-GAAP reconciliation table below, adjusted net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $9.5 million, or $0.25 per share, compared to adjusted net income of $6.9 million, or $0.19 per share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDAS in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, excluding the items shown in the reconciliation table below, was $16.8 million, compared to $14.9 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company generated $4.3 million in operating cash flow and $3.9 million in free cash flow. As of February 28, 2018, the Company had $53.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $93.8 million in debt, excluding the impact of deferred financing costs.\nNine Months Financial Results\nFor the nine months ended February 28, 2018:\nNet sales were $256.0 million, a decrease of 2.6%, compared to $262.7 million for the same period a year ago. The Company's net income was $14.2 million, or $0.38 per share, compared to net income of $17.9 million, or $0.49 per share, a year ago. Excluding the items shown in the non-GAAP reconciliation table below, adjusted net income for the nine months ended February 28, 2018 was $19.9 million, or $0.53 per share, compared to adjusted net income of $20.2 million, or $0.55 per share, a year ago. Adjusted EBITDAS, excluding the items shown in the reconciliation table below, was $41.5 million, compared to $44.4 million for the same period a year ago.\nFiscal Year 2018 Financial Guidance\nThe Company reaffirms its previously announced financial guidance and expects its fiscal year 2018 net sales in the range of $345 to $350 million and free cash flow in the range of $30 to $35 million, excluding the cash payment related to the previously disclosed Department of Justice legal matters that the Company now anticipates paying during the fourth quarter. The Company expects its adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.64 to $0.68, excluding any impact from the recently enacted 2017 Tax Reform Act. Including the impact of Tax Reform, guidance for adjusted earnings per share is $0.70 to $0.74.\nConference Call\nThe Company’s management will host a conference call today at 8:00 a.m. ET to discuss its third quarter 2018 results.\nTo participate in the conference call, dial 1-877-407-0784 (domestic) or 1-201-689-8560 (international) and refer to the passcode 13677111.\nThis conference call will also be webcast and can be accessed from the “Investors” section of the AngioDynamics website at www.angiodynamics.com .

Management encourages investors to review AngioDynamics' financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP to understand AngioDynamics' performance taking into account all relevant factors, including those that may only occur from time to time but have a material impact on AngioDynamics' financial results.

(2) Represents the net tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law the tax legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) that reduced the federal corporate tax rate to 21% and as such, resulted in an overall effective tax rate of 23%. Since the enactment date occurred during FY 2018, a blended rate must be determined in accordance with IRC Section 15 and therefore the statutory rates are prorated based on the number of days within the taxable year before and after the effective date of the change in the tax rate. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended February 28, 2018 is based on a blended rate of 30.62% that is used to tax effect the non-GAAP. The effective tax rate for the three months ended February 28, 2018 includes a catch-up for the updated 23% effective tax rate, and as such, the effective tax rate is 23.62%. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2017 was 36%. The current and prior year tax rates are based on our historical non-GAAP earnings and our tax effect of non-GAAP items has been calculated assuming no valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets.
