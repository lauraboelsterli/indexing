    "text": "3 Hours Ago | 01:07 \nA package bomb blew up at a FedEx distribution center near San Antonio on Tuesday, officials said, and the FBI was investigating whether it was linked to a series of four homemade bombs that hit the Texas capital of Austin this month. \nThe individual responsible for the explosion at FedEx also shipped a second package that has since been secured and turned over to law enforcement, FedEx told CNBC. \nOfficials did not say if the latest incident was the work of what Austin police believe could be a serial bomber responsible for the four earlier devices that killed two people and injured four others. \nThe blast at the FedEx facility in Schertz, northeast of San Antonio, was the fifth in the state in the last 18 days. If it is linked to the others, it would be the first outside the Austin area and the first that involves a commercial parcel service. \n\"We are investigating it as being possibly related to our open investigation,\" FBI spokeswoman Michelle Lee told the Austin American-Statesman newspaper. \"We can't know for sure until we have an opportunity to look at the evidence itself.\" Google Earth The FedEx Ground facility in Schertz, Texas. \nThe package, filled with nails and metal shrapnel, exploded shortly after midnight local time at the facility, about 65 miles south of Austin, the San Antonio Fire Department said on Twitter. \nThe company described it as a FedEx Ground sorting facility. About 75 people were working at the facility at the time, fire officials said. \nThe individual or people behind the bombings are likely to be highly skilled and methodical, said Fred Burton, chief security officer for Stratfor, a private intelligence and security consulting firm based in Austin. \n\"This is a race against time to find him before he bombs again,\" Burton said. \nMore than 500 federal agents were involved in the investigation. @KVUEJayWallis: DEVELOPING: Austin Police investigating a hazmat situation at this FedEx facility near ABIA. An employee tells me the building has been evacuated. She and other coworkers were told this is where the San Antonio box that exploded was headed. This hasn't been confirmed by police. \nAustin Mayor Steve Adler on Tuesday sought to reassure citizens. \"While the concern is real and the anxiety is real ... it can't immobilize us. It has to make us more determined. It has to make us more vigilant,\" he told a local television station. \nThe White House is monitoring the situation, spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told Fox News on Tuesday. \nFurther stoking fears, Austin police investigated a possible hazardous materials incident at a FedEx facility in Austin on Tuesday morning. There was no indication it was related to the bombings. UPDATE: The Austin Fire Department and @ ATCEMS are assisting @ Austin_Police with a suspicious package here at the FedEx facility. \nThe first three devices were parcel bombs dropped off in front of homes in three eastern Austin neighborhoods. The fourth went off on Sunday night on the west side of the city and was described by police as a more sophisticated device detonated through a trip wire mechanism. \nThe four devices were similar in construction, suggesting they were the work of the same bomb maker, officials said. Getty Images Austin Police Chief Brian Manley(L), ATF Special Agent in Charge Fred Milanowski, and FBI Agent Christopher Combs brief reporters during a press conference on March 19, 2018, in Austin, Texas. \nThe first two bombs killed Anthony Stephan House, a 39-year-old black man on March 2 and Draylen Mason, a 17-year-old African-American teenager on March 12. The third, also on March 12, severely injured a 75-year-old Hispanic woman. Police said they are investigating whether the bombings were hate crimes. \nSunday's trip wire bomb, which injured two white men, went off shortly after police made a rare public call to the suspect to explain his motives. \nAustin, with a population of nearly 1 million people, is home to the University of Texas and a plethora of technology companies and has been one of the fastest growing major U.S. cities.
