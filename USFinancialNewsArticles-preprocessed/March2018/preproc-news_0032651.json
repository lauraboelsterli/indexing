The air express unit of Deutsche Post AG DPSGY 0.62% is rolling out same-day and next-day delivery services in several U.S. cities this year, WSJ Logistics Report’s Erica E. Phillips writes, part of a broader effort to step up what it calls “instant” deliveries in big cities. The service marks a small step back towards domestic parcel delivery in the U.S. for DHL, which withdrew from broader domestic express services 10 years ago after a costly competition with United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. The new service is targeted at e-commerce demand and it could challenge UPS and FedEx for boxes that carry the highest delivery prices and strongest profit margins. And the market is so large and growing so fast that DHL, like its parcel competitors, may find it challenging to keep the deliveries moving while keeping costs down.\nA rebound in the oil sector is wreaking havoc on Canadian National Railway Co.’s services, from energy shipments to grain deliveries. Shippers across the country say they are falling weeks and even months behind deliveries to their customers because of erratic and reduced service at Canada’s biggest freight railroad . The WSJ’s Jacquie McNish writes the problems prompted the abrupt ouster last week of CN CEO Luc Jobin after concerns that the railroad wasn’t adding capacity fast enough. The railroad is buckling under changing market demands in part because of steep cost cuts CN imposed in 2015 to meet a downturn in the energy sector. That’s left little flexibility in operations, and triggered warnings from companies including Halliburton Inc. about late deliveries of fracking-sand shipments. Western Canada’s grain shippers are being hit especially hard, saying a train shortage is effectively blocking them from reaching export markets.\nAmazon.com Inc. is wrestling with a market-share problem in Japan. The e-tailing giant has cornered so much of the country’s online sales that it’s coming under antitrust scrutiny for the second time in as many years over its relationships with suppliers. The WSJ’s Mayumi Negishi reports that regulators are looking at how online retailers can distort competition and use their market power to gain an edge on pricing and the availability of goods. The case highlights the hurdles that Amazon and other online marketplaces face as they step up global expansion, and run into varying regulatory demands along with unique national market concerns. Japan is Amazon’s third largest market, after the U.S. and Germany, and generates $11.9 billion in sales. In Japan, it commands the biggest portion of the country’s online market, at more than 20%, and government officials have said the scale makes it hard for sellers to push back on Amazon as they seek customers from a shrinking population.\nCOMMODITIES The DHL air hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Photo: Bloomberg News China is locking up the supplies for an electric-car future. Swiss commodity giant Glencore PLC agreed to sell a chunk of its cobalt production to Shenzhen-listed GEM Co., the WSJ’s Scott Patterson writes, extending China’s efforts to dominate cobalt resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo , which turns out about 60% of the world’s supply. China is revving up its electric-vehicle industry, helping feed a kind of global gold rush for raw materials like cobalt, a critical ingredient in batteries for electric cars and smartphones. Apple Inc., Tesla Inc., Volkswagen AG and others have been scrambling to secure their own cobalt supplies, an effort that inevitably runs through Glencore, which controls about a quarter of the world’s cobalt output. The new deal will cover about a third of Glencore’s production over the next three years—enough to build up China’s electric-car fleet and to accelerate the push to find new supplies of the mineral.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ Canada’s international reputation as a reliable supplier is at stake. ’\n—Canadian Transport Minister Marc Garneau and Agriculture Minister Lawrence MacAulay, in a letter to rail CEOs on service problems.\nNumber of the Day 5.6% Year-over-year decline in grain shipments by U.S. railroads in the first two months of the year, to the lowest level since 2014, according to the Association of American Railroads.\nIN OTHER NEWS Economists in a survey say new tariffs will reduce U.S. employment modestly but fear escalating trade disputes could damage the U.S. economy.
