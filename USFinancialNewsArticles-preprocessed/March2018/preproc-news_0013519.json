    "text": "MUMBAI (Reuters) - The chief executive of India’s Punjab National Bank (PNB) met officials of the serious fraud office on Wednesday, as authorities widened a probe into a $2 billion fraud that has been billed as the country’s biggest banking scam.\nSunil Mehta (2nd L), Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Punjab National Bank, arrives at the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) amid a widening probe into a $2 billion fraud, in Mumbai, March 7, 2018. REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas Sunil Mehta’s appearance before the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) follows its meeting with executives of at least two other banks on Tuesday.\nPNB did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the SFIO probe.\nIn the fraud at PNB which was first disclosed by the bank in February, the lender and police have accused some bank employees of colluding with two jeweller groups which raised credit from overseas banks based on fraudulent guarantees issued by rogue PNB staff.\nPolice have also so far arrested 19 people including eight of PNB’s current and former employees, along with executives from jeweller Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi’s companies.\nExecutives from private sector lenders ICICI Bank and Axis Bank met with the SFIO on Tuesday, according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter.\nThe logo of Punjab National Bank (PNB) is seen on a branch office window in New Delhi, February 27, 2018. REUTERS/Saumya Khandelwal/Files In a statement to the stock exchange late on Tuesday, Axis said the SFIO had sought information from it on the accounts of Nirav Modi and Choksi’s Gitanjali group of companies.\nICICI Bank also told the stock exchange on Tuesday its executives continue to “engage actively and provide requisite inputs” to investigative authorities, without commenting on Tuesday’s meeting.\nIndian authorities including the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Enforcement Directorate have conducted extensive searches and questioned people in connection with the PNB fraud.\nBoth Choksi and Modi have denied the allegations and lawyers for the two key accused PNB employees in the case have also said they are innocent.\nA source and documents reviewed by Reuters on Tuesday showed the amount involved in the fraud is likely to rise beyond the $2 billion mark.\nShares in Punjab National Bank fell as much as 3.9 percent on Wednesday, tumbling for a fourth straight session. PNB has lost more than 40 percent of its market capitalisation since disclosing the fraud last month.\nReporting by Devidutta Tripathy; Editing by Euan Rocha and Muralikumar Anantharaman\n ",
