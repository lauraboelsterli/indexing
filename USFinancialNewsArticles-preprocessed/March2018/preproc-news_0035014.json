    "text": "  Fourteen missing after Chinese dredger capsizes off Malaysia   KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - One person drowned while 14 others are missing after a Chinese sand-dredging vessel capsized off Malaysiaâ€™s southern state of Johor on Wednesday, officials said. Three Chinese crew members were rescued safely after authorities received reports that the JBB Rong Chang 8 had overturned in the waters of Parit Jawa, in Muar district, at 8.50 a.m. local time (0050 GMT), the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency said in a statement. Search and rescue operations were ongoing, with two patrol boats deployed, the agency said. The Chinese-owned, Dominican-registered dredger was carrying one Malaysian, an Indonesian and 16 Chinese crew members. Reporting by Rozanna Latiff; Editing by Michael Perry",
