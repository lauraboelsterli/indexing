This fact was mainly due to the higher proportion of debit card transactions in our TPV in 2017 as compared to 2016.\nRevenue from sales\nNet revenue from sales in 2017 amounted to R$ 471.9 million, an increase of R$ 211.3 million, or 81.1 %, from R$260.6 million in 2016. However, in relative terms, the share from POS sales has decreased from 23% in 2016 to 19% in 2017. In addition, in 4Q17 the share of POS device sales has decreased to 13% from 25% in 4Q16.\nFinancial income\nFinancial income, which represents the finance discount we withhold from the early payment of receivables on the 2 nd through the 12 th installment, amounted to R$ 818.6 million in 2017, an increase of R$ 426.2 million, or 108.6 % from R$392.4 million in 2016.\nThe year-on-year growth in this activity was due to growth in our TPV.\nOther financial income\nOther financial income amounted to R$ 8.6 million in 2017, an increase of R$ 3.2 million, or 60.7 % from R$5.3 million in 2016.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses amounted to R$ 1,839.9 million in 2017, an increase of R$ 856.9 million, or 87.2 % from R$983.0 million in 2016. As a percentage of our Total revenue and income, our total expenses in 2017 decreased by 13.4 percentage points, to 72.9 % in 2017 from 86.3% in 2016.\nCost of sales and services\nCost of sales and services amounted to R$ 1,324.4 million in 2017, an increase of R$ 700.7 million, or 112.4 % from R$623.7 million in 2016. As a percentage of the total of our Net revenue from transaction activities and other services and our Net revenue from sales, our Cost of sales and services posted a decrease of 6.1 percentage points, to 78.1 % from 84.2% in 2016.\nWithin our Cost of sales and services line item, our Cost of services, expressed as a percentage of our Net revenue from transaction activities and other services, decreased to 67.8 % from 74.5% in 2016. This decrease reflected ongoing economies of scale due to growth in our TPV.\nOur Cost of sales, expressed as a percentage of our Net revenue from sales, posted a slight increase to 104.8 % in 2017 from 102.0% in 2016.\nSelling expenses\nOur Selling expenses amounted to R$ 245.8 million in 2017, an increase of R$ 45.8 million, or 22.9 % from R$199.9 million in 2016. As a percentage of our Total revenue and income, our Selling expenses decreased by 7.9 percentage points, to 9.7 % in 2017 from 17.6% in 2016. Our Marketing and advertising costs, while increased in absolute terms, decreased significantly as a percentage of Total revenue and income due to TPV growth.\nAdministrative expenses\nOur Administrative expenses amounted to R$ 153.2 million in 2017, an increase of R$ 68.7 million, or 81.4 %, from R$84.5 million in 2016. This increase was mainly due to an increase in personnel costs, bank and consulting fees. As a percentage of our Total revenue and income, our Administrative expenses decreased by 1.3 percentage points, to 6.1 % in 2017 from 7.4% in 2016.\nThe reduction in the level of our Administrative expenses as a percentage of our Total revenue and income over the last three years reflects the scalable nature of our business.\nFinancial expenses\nOur Financial expenses amounted to R$ 104.5 million in 2017, an increase of R$ 36.2 million, or 53.1 %, from expenses of R$68.3 million in 2016.\nExpressed as a percentage of our Financial income, our Financial expenses represented 12.8 % in 2017 and 17.4% in 2016.\nOther (expenses) income, net\nOur Other (expenses) income, net, recorded expenses of R$ 12.0 million in 2017.

With this new functionality, each terminal can serve up to six digital accounts, handling sales transactions for each account separately and allowing entrepreneurs and merchants to manage multiple businesses using a single POS device.\nIn March, PagSeguro launched the Minizinha Chip, its pocket point-of-sale device, an innovative new concept for POS terminals, that combines all of the high-end functionalities such as Wifi and GPRS connection within compact hardware that can literally fit in the merchants’ pocket.\nIdeal for small merchants and micro entrepreneurs seeking mobility and convenience, this pocket point-of-sale device no longer requires smartphone pairing like other traditional mobile POSs, since it comes with a SIM card and free data plan, thus improving the merchant experience.\nEarnings webcast\nPagSeguro (NYSE: PAGS) will host a conference call and earnings webcast on March 09 th , at 09:00 am EST.
