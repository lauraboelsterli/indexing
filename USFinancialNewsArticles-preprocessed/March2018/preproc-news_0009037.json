Net income for the fourth quarter was $3.2 million, or $0.27 per diluted share. The fourth quarter results include a one-time net charge of $10.2 million related to the U.S. tax reform bill that was enacted in December 2017. Excluding this charge, 2017 fourth quarter adjusted net income was $13.5 million, or $1.15 per diluted share. (1) This compares to fourth quarter 2016 net income of $7.6 million, or $0.65 per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2016 results include a $2.9 million non-cash charge related to a pension plan termination. Without this charge, 2016 adjusted fourth quarter net income was $9.4 million, or $0.81 per diluted share. (1)\nResults for the Full Year\nNet sales for the full year of 2017 were $912.4 million, up 8.0% compared to net sales of $844.7 million in the prior year. Net income for the full year was $44.3 million, or $3.79 per diluted share. Excluding the effects of the U.S. tax reform related charges referenced above, adjusted net income for the full year was $54.6 million, or $4.67 per diluted share, compared to 2016 adjusted net income of $41.9 million, or $3.62 per diluted share, an increase of 30.2%. (1) Full year 2016 adjusted results exclude the fourth quarter charge related to the pension plan termination mentioned above.\nThe results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 included the effects of the acquisitions of Santa Izabel and Old Dominion Brush Company, which were both completed in June 2017 and R.P.M. Tech, which was completed in August 2017. Together these three acquisitions contributed $13.9 million in net sales and $0.6 million in net income in the fourth quarter and $25.5 million in net sales and $1.0 million in net income for the full year of 2017. (1)\nNet income, excluding the U.S. tax reform related charge referenced previously, and net sales for both the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 were at record levels for Alamo Group, both including and excluding the effects of the acquisitions.\nResults by Division\nAlamo Group's Industrial Division net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $147.2 million compared to $122.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 20.2%. For the full year net sales in 2017 were $522.7 million compared to $484.1 million in 2016, an increase of 8.0%. The Division's income from operations for the full year 2017 was $51.9 million, compared to $36.0 million in 2016 which included the previously mentioned non-cash pension termination charge.

The Agricultural Division results include the effects of the acquisition of Santa Izabel, which contributed $2.1 million in net sales and a $0.2 million loss from operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $5.7 million in net sales and a $0.3 million loss from operations for the full year. (1)\nAlamo Group's European Division net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $39.6 million. This was an increase of 16.0% compared to net sales of $34.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year the Division's net sales were $162.3 million in 2017 compared to $154.8 million in 2016, an increase of 4.8%. Income from operations for the full year was $12.8 million, compared to the $10.9 million achieved in 2016.\nComments on Results\nRon Robinson, Alamo Group's President and CEO commented, \"Our fourth quarter results nicely capped off a very strong year for Alamo Group and we are proud of our total organization that delivered these results. Starting in 2015 and throughout most of 2016 we commented on a variety of headwinds that were constraining our results. These included weak overall agricultural market conditions; the negative effects on our snow removal products due to consecutive mild winters; declines in sales of certain Industrial Division products, mainly vacuum trucks to non-governmental end-users; generally soft economic conditions in our European markets; and, the negative effects of the strong U.S. dollar on the translation of our non-U.S. dollar denominated sales and earnings. Throughout 2017, we saw improvement in all five of these areas. The agricultural market is strengthening, further aided by lower dealer inventory levels; snow removal products are benefiting from more normal winter weather conditions; non-governmental sales and rentals of vacuum truck equipment have rebounded; European markets have strengthened considerably; and, even the U.S. dollar developed into more of a tailwind as it softened during the second half of 2017. As a consequence, our results for the year showed considerable improvement, albeit versus weaker comparables in 2016. We feel well positioned to see continued growth in both sales and operating income in 2018, although, at more modest rates than achieved in 2017. While there is always a degree of economic uncertainty, we are optimistic that our markets should continue to improve in 2018. And, we are hopeful external factors such as currency exchange rates will not move too dramatically either way throughout the year. Certainly, in 2017 we benefited from fairly low inflation in both labor and purchased components used in our production. We feel in 2018 we will experience moderate inflation as labor availability tightens and our commodity costs of items such as steel and energy have been rising, but as long as these increases remain reasonable, it should not have a material impact on our results.\n\"Acquisitions also helped our results for the year and should do so even more in 2018 as we get the full year benefit. While each of these was modest, together they should provide a nice bump to our results. They are good strategic fits in some of the niche markets in which we participate. We were also pleased that we were able to complete these acquisitions at reasonable prices, particularly given the challenges valuations are creating in the mergers and acquisition markets today. Acquisitions remain a key element in Alamo Group's ongoing development and while in the near term high expectations are likely to remain an issue, we feel we will still be able to complete deals without compromising our long term return objectives.\n\"Lastly, we believe the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 will have a meaningful impact on our results in the future. In 2017, our results were negatively impacted by the one-time transition tax on mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings. This resulted in a gross increase in income tax expense in 2017 of $13.1 million, offset somewhat by a $2.9 million benefit from the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the effects of the reduction of the U.S. federal tax rate to 21% as of the enactment date. The net result was a negative impact to our net income of $10.2 million in 2017. The charges related to the deemed repatriation will be paid out in installments over the next eight years beginning in 2018. As a result of this one-time tax, we will now be able to more economically repatriate cash being held in our international operations without being subject to significant incremental taxation. While we are still evaluating our options, we will repatriate some portion of the cash held by our international subsidiaries, though we will leave sufficient balances to meet our working capital needs, support anticipated capital expenditure requirements and other growth oriented initiatives. The cash we do repatriate will initially be used to pay down outstanding debt under our revolving line of credit, however, over time we anticipate it will be deployed to support our growth and acquisition initiatives.\n\"Another feature of the new tax act is a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% in our U.S. operations. The new rate takes effect in 2018 and should have a meaningful impact on our net earnings going forward since Alamo Group's overall effective tax rate has averaged around 35% annually over the last several years. The exact amount will ultimately be affected by a number of factors including the amount of U.S. earnings compared to our earnings from operations outside the U.S. Still, we believe this will enable us to increase our development expense going forward and to accelerate our various operation improvement initiatives which should make us more competitive in the international markets in which we participate.\n\"All in all, we are encouraged by the record results we achieved for the full year of 2017 and feel the positive developments in both our internal operations and externally in our markets should provide a solid platform for continued growth in 2018. Our markets show signs of stability and the outlook is improving as evidenced by our record backlog at year-end of over $218 million. While this will certainly benefit us as we move forward, we are somewhat concerned by the effect this is having on some of our production lead times. This is being partially addressed by our ongoing operational improvement initiatives, which we are accelerating and will result in an increased level of capital expenditures in 2018 compared to the averages in recent years.\n\"Improving markets, further improvements in operating efficiencies, contributions from acquisitions and a more competitive tax structure all should contribute to continued growth for Alamo Group in 2018. We like where our Company is positioned today. Still we remain cautious about factors that could impact our business negatively and certainly the headwinds we faced in 2015 and 2016 remain fresh in our memories. We are pleased with our demonstrated ability to deal with changing conditions and keep Alamo Group moving forward. We thank you for your support in this ongoing journey.\"\nEarnings Conference Call\nAlamo Group will host a conference call to discuss fourth quarter and year end 2017 financial results on Friday , March 2, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern (10 a.m. Central, 9:00 a.m. Mountain and 8:00 a.m. Pacific) .

For these purposes, \"GAAP\" refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) defines a \"non-GAAP financial measure\" as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial positions, or cash flows that is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude or include amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by Alamo Group are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with greater transparency about, or an alternative method for assessing, our financial condition and operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, GAAP and may be different from, or inconsistent with, non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure we reference and such comparable GAAP financial measure.\nAttachment 1 discloses the impact of the Company's recently completed acquisitions upon Sales, Operating Income and Net Income all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Attachment 2 discloses Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted EPS each adjusted to exclude the impact of the recently completed acquisitions, related transaction costs, new tax legislation, and the impact of a terminated pension plan, all of which are non-GAAP financial measures. Attachment 3 discloses a non-GAAP financial presentation related to the impact of currency translation on net sales by division. Attachment 4 shows the net change in our total debt, net of cash, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\"), both of which are non-GAAP financial measures.
