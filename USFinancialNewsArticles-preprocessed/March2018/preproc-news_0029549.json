    "text": "COMMERCE, Calif., March 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Smart & Final Stores, Inc. (the \"Company\") (NYSE:SFS), the value-oriented food and everyday staples retailer, today reported financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year\nFourth Quarter Highlights:\nNet sales increase of 6.7% to $1,068 million driven by comparable store sales increase of 3.2%. Online options for both business and household customers, including delivery or in-store pickup options, available in over 85% of Smart & Final banner stores. Net loss of $146.6 million in fourth quarter reflects non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $180 million. Adjusted net income of $11.3 million or $0.15 per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA of $49.1 million. Named one of Fortune's \"Most Admired Companies\" for second consecutive year.\n\"We have a differentiated position in the evolving retail marketplace and our unique store operating model enables us to maintain our position as a low-cost leader serving multiple sales channels,\" said David Hirz, president and chief executive officer. \"We are pleased with our strengthening comparable store sales trends, which represent the third consecutive quarter of comp growth. This reflects the success of our merchandising initiatives aimed at both household and business customers with an emphasis on our natural and organic, private label and club-size items. These initiatives, combined with our efforts in strategic sourcing and pricing, contributed to a gross margin rate expansion in the fourth quarter, despite ongoing promotional activity within the grocery landscape.\"\nMr. Hirz continued, \"Over the course of 2017, we accelerated the expansion of our online sales channel and delivery offerings, with over 85% of our Smart & Final banner stores offering delivery or in-store pickup at year-end. While we remain focused on our strong brick-and-mortar stores with two successful store banners, we are increasingly focused on digital channels for brand marketing and customer transaction options. In 2018, we plan to make additional investments in our infrastructure to position all of our sales channels for continued success.\"\nIn order to aid understanding of the Company's business performance, it has presented results in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\") and has also presented EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, and adjusted net income per diluted share, which are non-GAAP measures that are explained and reconciled to the comparable GAAP measures in the tables included in this release. Where applicable, the results below are first presented on a GAAP basis and then on a non-GAAP adjusted basis.\nFiscal Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nNet sales were $1,067.9 million in the 12-week quarter , representing a 6.7% increase as compared to $1,000.6 million for the same period of 2016. Net sales growth was driven by a 3.2% increase in comparable store sales and the net sales contribution of new stores. Comparable store sales growth was comprised of a 3.7% increase in comparable average transaction size, partially offset by a 0.4% decrease in comparable transaction count, including the effect of cannibalization from new stores.\nNet sales for Smart & Final banner stores were $841.4 million, a 5.7% increase as compared to $796.3 million for the same period of 2016. Comparable store sales growth for the Smart & Final banner was 2.5% in the fourth quarter.\nNet sales for Cash & Carry Smart Foodservice banner stores were $226.6 million, a 10.8% increase as compared to $204.4 million for 2016. Comparable store sales growth for the Cash & Carry banner was 6.2% in the fourth quarter.\nGross margin was $164.4 million, a 16.7% increase as compared to $140.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross margin rate was 15.4% as compared to 14.1% for the same period of 2016.\nOperating and administrative expenses were $147.1 million, an 8.8% increase as compared to $135.2 million for the same period of 2016. The increase was related to expenses associated with the effect of higher minimum wages, the 14 new stores that opened following the fourth quarter of 2016 through the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 and related support costs.\nNet loss was $146.6 million, or $2.03 per diluted share, as compared to a net loss of $0.3 million for the same period of 2016. These results included a non-cash net benefit of $27.0 million, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other one-time items, primarily due to a lower valuation of net deferred tax liabilities. During the quarter, the Company also recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $180.0 million, related to the Company's Smart & Final banner.\nAdjusted net income was $11.3 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, as compared to $5.0 million, or $0.07 per share, for the same period of 2016. Adjusted net income excludes the $27.0 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, benefit associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other one-time items, and the $180.0 million, or $2.44 per diluted share, goodwill impairment charge.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $49.1 million as compared to $37.3 million for the same period of 2016.\nFiscal 2017 Financial Results\nIn the fifty-two weeks , net sales were $4,570.6 million, an increase of 5.3% as compared to $4,341.8 million for the same period of 2016. Net sales growth was driven by the net sales contribution of new stores, and a 1.0% increase in comparable store sales. Comparable store sales growth was comprised of a 0.3% increase in comparable transaction count, and a 0.8% increase in comparable average transaction size.\nNet sales for Smart & Final banner stores were $3,557.7 million, an increase of 4.6% as compared to $3,400.8 million for 2016. Full year 2017 comparable store sales for the Smart & Final banner increased 0.7%.\nNet sales for Cash & Carry Smart Foodservice banner stores were $1,012.9 million, a 7.6% increase as compared to $941.0 million for 2016. Full year 2017 comparable store sales for the Cash & Carry banner increased 2.4%.\nNet loss was $138.9 million, or $1.92 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $12.9 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for fiscal 2016. These results included a non-cash net benefit of $27.0 million, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other one-time items, primarily due to a lower valuation of net deferred tax liabilities. During the fourth quarter, the Company also recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $180.0 million, related to the Company's Smart & Final banner.\nAdjusted net income was $33.6 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, as compared to $42.2 million, or $0.54 per share, for 2016. Adjusted net income excludes the $27.0 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, benefit associated with income tax reform and other one-time items, as well as the $180.0 million, or $2.39 per diluted share, goodwill impairment charge, recorded in the fourth quarter 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $184.4 million as compared to $180.3 million for 2016.\nGoodwill Impairment\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company concluded an annual review of its goodwill as required under accounting standard ASC 350. The review included current equity market valuation metrics and the Company's near term plans for growth. The result of the review was an impairment of Smart & Final banner goodwill in the amount of $180.0 million. The Company does not believe that this impairment charge reflects a fundamental change in the long-term attractiveness of future store investments.\nGrowth and Development\nDuring the fiscal fourth quarter of 2017, the Company opened seven new Smart & Final Extra! stores, and completed three expansions of legacy Smart & Final stores to the Extra! store format, and one store relocation. As of December 31, 2017, the Company operated a total of 323 stores, including 194 Smart & Final Extra! stores, 66 legacy format Smart & Final stores and 63 Cash & Carry Smart Foodservice stores.\nOperating Stores at Fiscal Year End (December 31, 2017)\nSmart & Final Banner Stores\nCash & Carry\nBanner Stores\nTotal\nCompany\nExtra!\nformat\nLegacy\nformat\nTotal\nEnd of Fiscal 2016\n172\n74\n246\n59\n305\nNew stores\n14\n-\n14\n4\n18\nRelocations, net\n3\n(3)\n-\n-\n-\nExpansions\n5\n(5)\n-\n-\n-\nStore closures\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nEnd of Fiscal 2017\n194\n66\n260\n63\n323\nLeverage and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's debt, net of debt issuance costs, was $699.4 million and cash and cash equivalents were $71.7 million.\nFor the fifty-two weeks , the Company generated cash from operations of $169.5 million and invested $162.6 million in capital expenditures, primarily related to the development of Extra! format stores and to improvements of existing assets.\nOutlook\nThe Company is providing the following guidance for the full year ending December 30, 2018:\nNet sales growth\n4.0% - 5.0%\nComparable store sales growth\n1.0% - 2.0%\nUnit growth (new stores)\n3-5 Smart & Final Extra!\n3-5 Cash & Carry Smart Foodservice\nRelocations of existing stores to Extra! format\n2-3 Smart & Final stores\nExpansions or conversions of legacy stores to Extra! format\n1-2 Smart & Final stores\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$180 - $190 million\nAdjusted net income\n$31 - $35 million\nAdjusted diluted EPS\n$0.42 - $0.47\nCapital expenditures (net)\n$80 - $90 million\nFully diluted weighted average shares\n74 to 75 million\nThe above guidance includes certain non-GAAP financial measures (namely adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share), which exclude certain costs and non-cash costs and provide investors with additional financial measures of the expected operating performance of the Company's business. The primary factors in reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures include the following: pre-opening costs associated with new stores of approximately $3.8 million, non-cash rent related to stores of approximately $2.9 million, share-based compensation expense of approximately $15.5 million, and $3.9 million of store closure expenses. The other amounts needed to reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures cannot be quantified and are not available without an unreasonable effort.\nThe Company additionally is providing first quarter 2018 guidance for comparable store sales growth of 1.0% to 1.5% and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $23 to $25 million.\nFiscal Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time / 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss its fiscal fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 financial results.

presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures (namely EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, and adjusted net income per diluted share) to evaluate our operating and financial performance and to compare such performance to that of prior periods. We also use these non-GAAP financial measures in making operational and financial decisions and in establishing operational goals. We believe that providing these non-GAAP financial measures to investors, as a supplement to GAAP financial measures, helps investors to (i) evaluate our operating and financial performance and future prospects, (ii) compare financial results across accounting periods, (iii) better understand the long-term performance of our core business and (iv) evaluate trends in our business, all consistent with how management evaluates such performance and movements. The Company defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, interest expense and provision (benefit) for income tax, and adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted for the items set forth in the table below. The Company defines adjusted net income as net income (loss) adjusted for the items set forth in the table below. The Company defines adjusted net income (loss) per share as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average basic shares outstanding. The Company defines adjusted net income per diluted share as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nUse of these non-GAAP measures may differ from similar measures reported by other companies. Each of these non-GAAP measures has its limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP.\nThe following tables present reconciliations of net income to EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income, and net income (loss) per share to adjusted net income per share and adjusted net income per diluted share, for the twelve-week and fifty-two week periods\nSmart & Final Stores, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nReconciliation of Net Income to Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income\n(Unaudited)\n(In Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Amounts)\nTwelve Weeks\nEnded December\n31, 2017\nTwelve Weeks\nEnded January 1,\n2017\nFifty-two Weeks\nEnded December\n31, 2017\nFifty-two Weeks\nEnded January 1,\n2017\nNet (loss) income\n$ (146,556)\n$ (253)\n$ (138,914)\n$ 12,948\nIncome tax (benefit)\n(24,462)\n(1,650)\n(24,043)\n(2,037)\n(Loss) income before income taxes\n(171,018)\n(1,903)\n(162,957)\n10,911\nAdjustments to net (loss) income\nNet loss from closed stores and exit costs (a)\n1,262\n2,650\n3,818\n8,671\nGoodwill impairment (b)\n180,000\n-\n180,000\n-\nLoss from asset dispositions and impairment charges (c)\n369\n594\n1,827\n1,598\nShare-based compensation expense (d)\n3,057\n2,555\n11,560\n9,803\nNon-cash rent (e)\n1,492\n1,688\n6,535\n7,946\nPre-opening costs (f)\n1,914\n926\n5,433\n17,695\nLoss on extinguishment of debt (g)\n-\n-\n-\n4,978\nOther items (h)\n(45)\n377\n3,390\n(1,018)\nAdjusted income tax (benefit)\n(5,731)\n(1,890)\n(15,951)\n(18,363)\nAdjusted net income\n$ 11,300\n$ 4,997\n$ 33,655\n$ 42,221\nAdjusted Net (Loss) Income Per Share\nNet (loss) income per share - basic\n$ (2.03)\n$ 0.00\n$ (1.92)\n$ 0.18\nPer share impact of net income adjustments\n2.19\n0.07\n2.39\n0.40\nAdjusted net income per share - basic\n$ 0.16\n$ 0.07\n$ 0.47\n$ 0.58\nNet (loss) income per share - diluted\n$ (1.99)\n$ 0.00\n$ (1.85)\n$ 0.17\nPer share impact of net income adjustments\n2.14\n0.07\n2.30\n0.37\nAdjusted net income per share - diluted\n$ 0.15\n$ 0.07\n$ 0.45\n$ 0.54\nWeighted average shares - basic\n72,068,998\n71,962,127\n72,352,102\n72,727,071\nWeighted average shares - diluted\n73,828,639\n76,552,257\n75,182,134\n78,026,159\nSmart & Final Stores, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nReconciliation of EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA\n(Unaudited)\n(In Thousands)\nTwelve Weeks\nEnded December\n31, 2017\nTwelve Weeks\nEnded January 1,\n2017\nFifty-two Weeks\nEnded December\n31, 2017\nFifty-two Weeks\nEnded January 1,\n2017\nNet (loss) income\n$ (146,556)\n$ (253)\n$ (138,914)\n$ 12,948\nDepreciation and amortization\n23,324\n22,500\n98,373\n87,015\nInterest expense, net\n8,732\n7,925\n36,470\n32,654\nIncome tax (benefit)\n(24,462)\n(1,650)\n(24,043)\n(2,037)\nEBITDA\n(138,962)\n28,522\n(28,114)\n130,580\nAdjustments to EBITDA\nNet loss from closed stores and exit costs (a)\n1,262\n2,650\n3,818\n8,671\nGoodwill impairment (b)\n180,000\n-\n180,000\n-\nLoss from asset dispositions and impairment charges (c)\n369\n594\n1,827\n1,598\nShare-based compensation expense (d)\n3,057\n2,555\n11,560\n9,803\nNon-cash rent (e)\n1,492\n1,688\n6,535\n7,946\nPre-opening costs (f)\n1,914\n926\n5,433\n17,695\nLoss on extinguishment of debt (g)\n-\n-\n-\n4,978\nOther items (h)\n(45)\n377\n3,390\n(1,018)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 49,087\n$ 37,312\n$ 184,449\n$ 180,253\n(a)\nRepresents costs associated with store closure and exit costs.\n(b)\nRepresents non-cash charge associated with goodwill impairment.\n(c)\nRepresents non-cash loss associated with asset dispositions and impairment charges.\n(d)\nRepresents expenses associated with the Company's equity-based incentive award program.\n(e)\nRepresents non-cash component of recognized rent expense.\n(f)\nRepresents new store and relocation opening costs consisting primarily of rent, utilities, distribution, store labor and advertising.\n(g)\nRepresents loss on the early extinguishment of debt in the fiscal year ended January 1, 2017 in connection with amendments to the Company's First Lien Term Loan Credit Facility.\n(h)\nRepresents (i) severance costs in the twelve and fifty-two weeks and the twelve and fifty-two weeks ended January 1, 2017 and (ii) death benefit income from a Company-owned life insurance policy in the fifty-two weeks ended January 1, 2017.\nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20140929/149066\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/smart--final-stores-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-financial-results-300614091.html\nSOURCE Smart & Final Stores, Inc.",
