    "text": "FOSTER CITY, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Guidewire Software, Inc. (NYSE: GWRE), a provider of software products to Property and Casualty insurers, today announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2018.\n“The breadth of Guidewire InsurancePlatform contributed to a successful second quarter in which we exceeded our guidance for revenue and non-GAAP profitability,” said Marcus Ryu, chief executive officer, Guidewire Software. “We continue to benefit from the enduring demand for legacy core system replacement in all our major markets, as well as adoption of our complementary offerings for digital engagement, data management and visualization, and advanced analytics.”\nRyu continued, “By continuing to invest in new products, distribution in international markets, and delivery of InsurancePlatform in the cloud, we are enabling P&C insurers to adapt their products and operations to a time of rapid industry change.”\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Highlights\nRevenue\nTotal revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $163.8 million, an increase of 42% from the same quarter in fiscal 2017. License and other revenue was $84.2 million, an increase of 31%, services revenue was $60.5 million, an increase of 73%, and maintenance revenue was $19.1 million, an increase of 15%. License and other revenue benefited from approximately $4.6 million of payments received in the quarter in advance of their due date. Rolling four-quarter recurring revenue was $345.9 million for the period ended January 31, 2018, an increase of 21% compared to the same metric for the period ended January 31, 2017.\nProfitability\nGAAP loss from operations was $0.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with income of $8.2 million in the comparable period in fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP income from operations was $32.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with income of $28.4 million in the comparable period in fiscal 2017. GAAP net loss, adversely impacted by a net tax expense of $28.6 million, driven primarily by the effects of the provisions of The Tax and Jobs Act passed in December 2017, was $45.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with a net income of $4.0 million for the comparable period in fiscal 2017. GAAP net loss per share was $0.59, based on diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 76.9 million, compared with $0.05 net income per share for the comparable period in fiscal 2017, based on diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 74.8 million. The net tax expense of $28.6 million resulted from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities required by the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which lowered the Company’s U.S. statutory tax rate. Non-GAAP net income was $25.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with a net income of $20.6 million in the comparable period in fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $0.33, based on diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 78.3 million, compared with net income per diluted share of $0.28 in the comparable period in fiscal 2017, based on diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 74.8 million.\nLiquidity\nThe Company had $569.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments at January 31, 2018, compared with $687.8 million at July 31, 2017. The decline was due to the use of approximately $130.1 million of cash in connection with the acquisition of Cyence, offset by approximately $47.7 million of cash generated from operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $42.6 million cash from operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nBusiness Outlook\nGuidewire is issuing the following outlook for the third quarter and fiscal 2018, based on current expectations:\n(in $ millions, except per share outlook) Third Quarter\nFiscal 2018\nFull Year\nFiscal 2018 Revenue 135.0 - 139.0 644.0 - 650.0 License and other revenue 47.0 - 49.0 304.0 - 312.0 Maintenance revenue 18.5 - 19.0 75.0 - 77.0 Services revenue 69.0 - 71.0 260.0 - 266.0 GAAP operating loss (38.5) - (34.5) (27.7) - (21.7) Non-GAAP operating income (loss) (5.0) - (1.0) 97.0 - 103.0 GAAP net loss (39.7) - (35.4) (44.6) - (38.6) GAAP net loss per share (0.51) - (0.46) (0.58) - (0.51)\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) (2.6) - 0.3\n76.3 - 80.6 Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share (0.03) - 0.0\n0.98 - 1.04 Non-GAAP operating income (loss) and non-GAAP net income (loss) exclude stock-based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets. The GAAP and non-GAAP estimated annual tax rates used to compute net income and EPS exclude discrete items such as forecasted tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and are impacted by the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nConference Call Information\nWhat: Guidewire Software Second Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Results Conference Call When: Tuesday, March 6, 2018 Time: 2:00 p.m. PT (5:00 p.m. ET) Live Call: (800) 239-9838, Domestic\n(323) 794-2551, International Replay: (844) 512-2921, Passcode 3804361, Domestic\n(412) 317-6671, Passcode 3804361, International Webcast: http://ir.guidewire.com (live and replay)\nThe webcast will be archived on Guidewire’s website ( www.guidewire.com ) for a period of three months.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains the following non-GAAP financial measures: Non-GAAP operating income, Non-GAAP net income (loss), Non-GAAP income tax provision (benefit), and Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share. These Non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation and amortization of intangibles, and the tax effect of these adjustments for Non-GAAP net income (loss) and Non-GAAP net income (loss) per share.\nGuidewire believes that these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to Guidewire’s financial condition and results of operations. The Company’s management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare the Company’s performance to that of prior periods for trend analysis, for purposes of determining executive and senior management incentive compensation and for budgeting and planning purposes. The Company believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company’s financial measures with other software companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\nManagement of the Company does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Guidewire urges investors to review the reconciliation of its non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly financial results, including this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.\nReconciliation tables of the most comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are included with the financial tables at the end of this release.\nAbout Guidewire Software\nGuidewire delivers the software that Property and Casualty (P&C) insurers need to adapt and succeed in a time of rapid industry change.
