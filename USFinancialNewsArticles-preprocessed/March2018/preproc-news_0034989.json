    "text": "REDWOOD CITY, Calif., March 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Bowers & Wilkins, the British loudspeaker brand known for its high-performance audio products, continues to expand its North American sales team by adding another audio industry veteran, Jim Kozicki. Jim joins the team as Regional Sales Manager for the Northern Territory, representing the latest in a series of high profile appointments at Bowers & Wilkins. Jim's hiring follows the recent additions of Kevin Wolff, Director of North American Sales; David Ellington, Regional Sales Manager Southern Territory; and Andrew Kissinger, Regional Sales Manager for the Southwest Territory.\nKozicki's career in premium audio spans over 25 years and began in Home Theater sales, working with retailers including Barrett's Technology Solutions, Grants and Sears. He moved to the famed Abt in Chicago where he held many roles including General Manager. Jim has been active in the industry, serving as a member of the Audio Steering Committee with Pro Source, and was named Dealerscope Magazine's Most Influential Buyer in 2016. Jim is known for follow up, follow through and providing excellent customer service throughout his 16 years in different leadership positions.\nIn his new role, Kozicki will be responsible for managing the Northern Sales Territory of the rapidly expanding Bowers & Wilkins product family â€“ including the recently announced 700 Series, the PX Wireless Noise-Cancelling Headphones, the DB Series Subwoofers, and the Rotel line.\n\"We are excited to welcome another audio industry veteran to our expanding North American sales team,\" said Richard Campbell, Chief Revenue Officer. \"Jim is known throughout the industry and has a reputation for caring deeply for his customers and consumers, a commitment that we share at Bowers & Wilkins.\"\n\"I am honoured to be joining the Bowers and Wilkins team,\" said Kozicki. \"Bowers & Wilkins is a very well respected and iconic brand, and I am excited to have been given this opportunity to help represent them.\"\nJim Kozicki represents yet another senior hire on the expanding North American sales team, since Richard Campbell took over Bowers & Wilkins global sales this past year. The hire represents a continuing investment in the brand and a focus on customer service, as Bowers & Wilkins continues to strengthen its already premier position as the leader for performance audio across custom install, luxury home speakers, headphones and performance car audio.\nAbout Bowers & Wilkins\nBowers & Wilkins is Britain's leading manufacturer of high performance speakers and headphones.
