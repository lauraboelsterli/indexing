    "text": "0 COMMENTS Trump plans to apply steel and aluminum tariffs globally and won’t exempt allies, a senior White House official said.\nThe threat of a trade war sparked turmoil in global markets. The Dow fell 70.92 points to 24538.06, putting its weekly drop at over 3%.\nNucor, US Steel and Century Aluminum lead a short list of companies that welcomed the plan.\nThe tariffs are likely to keep driving up domestic metal prices that have already been on a tear.\nBlackRock posed questions to gun firms on its website, another sign that money managers are boosting pressure on the industry.\nHNA received behind-the-scenes aid from Beijing.\nBiogen and AbbVie pulled their new MS drug after several patients suffered brain inflammations.\nA lumber shortage has pushed prices to record highs as builders prepare for the construction season.\nLibor surpassed 2% for the first time in 10 years, lifting borrowing costs on trillions of dollars in loans.",
