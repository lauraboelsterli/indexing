Retail sales in February fell for a third month in a row, a surprise to economists looking for a slight gain and its longest stretch of declines since 2012. Fourth-quarter sales were at their strongest in seven years.\n\"The consumer is far from dead, but we see enough warning signs out there on the horizon that have caused us to just scale back given the fact that we're in the seventh or eighth inning of this bull market,\" said Tepper.\nWhat money consumers have spent has largely been funded by credit and debt. Household debt in the U.S. over the fourth quarter increased at its fastest pace in a decade, while the personal savings rate dropped to its lowest level since 2008.\n\"At this point even a modest tick down in consumer confidence coupled with rebuilding up that savings can really dent consumer spending,\" said Tepper.\nIf the Fed raises rates as expected this year, interest rates on consumer loans will rise and the availability of cheap debt will drop. The central bank is expected to raise rates at least three times this year, the first as soon as next week.\nHigher and more expensive debt could have consumers cutting down on expenses, says Tepper. The first casualties, he says, will be companies that rely on non-essential spending, such as Harley Davidson and Tiffany .\n\"They represent products that aren't a necessity,\" he said. \"People still need to drive their Ford back and forth to work, but having a Harley isn't a must so stocks like those are going to be negatively impacted.\"\nStarbucks could also be victim to more conservative spending, says Matt Maley, equity strategist at Miller Tabak. Its share performance already has the company's stock at risk.\n\"The stock has been stuck in this range for quite some time,\" Maley said on \"Trading Nation.\" \"It made a double top here in 2015 and 2017, so if it breaks below that into that range it would confirm a double top is in place and it would be quite negative for the stock.\"\nStarbucks, Harley-Davidson and Tiffany's have already underperformed the broader sector in the year to date. Since the beginning of 2018, Starbucks has added 2 percent, while Harley-Davidson has dropped 14 percent and Tiffany's 3 percent. The XLY Consumer Discretionary ETF is up 7 percent.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.\nDisclaimer",
