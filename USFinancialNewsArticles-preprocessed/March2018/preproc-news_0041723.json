    "text": "The income tax charge was related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“tax reform”) was signed into law\nLINCOLNTON, N.C., March 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Carolina Trust BancShares, Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:CART) announces that its financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 have been revised to report a net loss of $354,000 or $0.07 per diluted share. Previously, on January 26, 2018, the Company reported a net loss of $196,000 or $0.04 per diluted share. The $158,000 change in earnings is due to additional income tax expense recorded for a correction to the revaluation of the deferred tax assets (“DTAs”).\nThe DTA revaluation was required when tax reform was signed into law on December 22, 2017, which lowered the Company’s federal tax rate from 34% to 21% beginning in 2018. Originally, the Company recorded an estimated income tax charge of $778,000 due to the revaluation of the DTAs. After further review, the estimated income tax charge has been revised to $936,000, an increase of $158,000, to correct an error in the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in the initial estimate.\nDollars in thousands, except share and per share data Carolina Trust BancShares, Inc.
