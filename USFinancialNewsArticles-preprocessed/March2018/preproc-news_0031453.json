    "text": "STEVENSON, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The securities litigation law firm of Brower Piven, A Professional Corporation, announces that a class action lawsuit has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia on behalf of purchasers of Aflac Incorporated (NYSE: AFL) (“Aflac” or the “Company”) securities during the period between February 27, 2013 and January 11, 2018, inclusive (the “Class Period”). Investors who wish to become proactively involved in the litigation have until April 16, 2018 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff.\nIf you wish to choose counsel to represent you and the class, you must apply to be appointed lead plaintiff and be selected by the Court. The lead plaintiff will direct the litigation and participate in important decisions including whether to accept a settlement for the class in the action. The lead plaintiff will be selected from among applicants claiming the largest loss from investment in Aflac securities during the Class Period. Members of the class will be represented by the lead plaintiff and counsel chosen by the lead plaintiff. No class has yet been certified in the above action.\nThe complaint accuses the defendants of violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by virtue of the defendants’ failure to disclose during the Class Period that Aflac hired its sales associates under false promises of high compensation packages and work-life-balance, that Aflac misclassified its employees as independent contractors to reduce costs associated with unemployment insurance taxes and employment benefits, that Aflac manipulated its average weekly producer equivalent metric to fabricate growth, and that Aflac violated its Code of Conduct and corporate social responsibility standards.\nAccording to the complaint, following a January 11, 2018, post-market report revealing undisclosed lawsuits against Aflac for exploitation of workers, manipulation of accounting, and insider trading, the value of Aflac shares declined significantly.\nIf you have suffered a loss in excess of $100,000 from investment in Aflac securities purchased on or after February 27, 2013 and held through the revelation of negative information during and/or at the end of the Class Period and would like to learn more about this lawsuit and your ability to participate as a lead plaintiff, without cost or obligation to you, please contact Brower Piven either by email at hoffman@browerpiven.com or by telephone at (410) 415-6616.\nAttorneys at Brower Piven have extensive experience in litigating securities and other class action cases and have been advocating for the rights of shareholders since the 1980s. If you choose to retain counsel, you may retain Brower Piven without financial obligation or cost to you, or you may retain other counsel of your choice. You need take no action at this time to be a member of the class.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180316005799/en/\nBrower Piven, A Professional Corporation\nCharles J.
