    "text": "Isaiah Thomas scored a game-high 29 points off the bench and Julius Randle added 25 points to power the visiting Los Angeles Lakers past the Miami Heat 131-113 on Thursday night at AmericanAirlines Arena in Miami.\nThe 131 points are the most allowed by Miami this season. Since 1995, it was just the fourth time the Heat has allowed more than 130 points.\nBrandon Ingram added 19 points, five assists and five rebounds but left the game with 3:41 remaining due to an apparent leg injury.\nLakers rookie point guard Lonzo Ball returned to the starting lineup for the first time since Jan. 13, producing eight points, seven assists and six rebounds.\nThe Lakers have matched a season-best with four wins in a row, averaging more than 120 points during that span. They shot 59.5 percent from the floor, including 63 percent in a red-hot first half that gave them a 73-62 lead at the break.\nDwyane Wade (25 points) and Goran Dragic (19 points) led the Heat.\nWade, fresh off a season-high 27-point performance on Tuesday against the Philadelphia 76ers, had the shot of the game in the first half. He made an 8-foot baseline jumper from behind the basket. The ball grazed the backboard on the way down.\nStill, the Heat lost for the ninth time in their past 12 games. They are clinging to the eighth and final playoff position in the Eastern Conference.\nLos Angeles, which is just 11-21 on the road this season, is 8-3 in its past 11 games.\nThe Heat played without a pair of shooting guards — starter Tyler Johnson and backup Wayne Ellington — who each suffered quad injuries in the team’s win over the 76ers on Tuesday.\nMiami responded to the injuries by moving small forward Josh Richardson to the backcourt, adding 7-foot power forward Kelly Olynyk to the starting lineup. But the bigger lineup could not cope with the Lakers’ speed.\nLos Angeles was without guard Josh Hart, who broke his left hand in practice, and wing forward Corey Brewer, who was bought out of his contract. Hart’s injury paved the way for Ball to return to the starting lineup.\nMiami led 36-33 after one quarter, but the Heat couldn’t stop Randle, who had 21 points in the first half.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
