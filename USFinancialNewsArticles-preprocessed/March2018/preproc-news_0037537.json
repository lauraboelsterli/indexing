On March 6, 2018, Credit Suisse announced expected coupon payments for USOI, GLDI and SLVO. This Media Release supersedes any prior announcement with respect to such expected coupon payments.\n2. For each ETN, the Current Yield equals the Coupon Amount, annualized and divided by the Closing Indicative Value, as discussed in more detail below. The Current Yield is not indicative of future coupon payments, if any, on the ETNs. You are not guaranteed any coupon payment or distribution under the ETNs. Coupon payments for the ETNs (if any) are variable and do not represent fixed, periodic interest payments. The Coupon Amount may vary significantly from coupon period to coupon period and may be zero. Any payment on the ETNs is subject to Credit Suisse's ability to pay its obligations as they become due. Accordingly, the Current Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. For more information regarding any ETN's coupon payments, please refer to such ETN's pricing supplement.\n3. The Current Yield equals the sum of (i) the Coupon Amount, plus (ii) the amount of the ETN's two most recent coupon payments, multiplied by four (to annualize such amounts), divided by the Closing Indicative Value, and rounded to two decimal places for ease of analysis.\nPress Contact\nAzar Boehm, Credit Suisse AG, telephone +1 212 538 3953, azar.boehm@credit-suisse.com\nCredit Suisse ETNs\nTelephone +1 800 320 1225, ETN.Desk@credit-suisse.com\nThe ETNs may not be suitable for all investors and should be purchased only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of investing in the ETNs. The ETNs are subject to the credit risk of Credit Suisse. You may receive less, and possibly significantly less, than the principal amount of your investment at maturity or upon repurchase or sale. Coupon payments on the ETNs will vary and could be zero. There is no actual portfolio of assets in which any investor in the ETNs has any ownership or other interest. Investors in the ETNs do not have voting rights, distribution rights or other rights with respect to the assets included in the tracked indices. An investment in the ETNs involves significant risks. For further information regarding risks, please see the section entitled \"Risk Factors\" in the applicable pricing supplement.\nCredit Suisse AG\nCredit Suisse AG is one of the world's leading financial services providers and is part of the Credit Suisse group of companies (referred to here as 'Credit Suisse').
