    "text": "Nikola Mirotic came off the bench to score a game-high 26 points as the New Orleans Pelicans won their 10th consecutive game with a 114-101 victory against the Kings on Wednesday night in Sacramento .\nJrue Holiday added 23, Anthony Davis scored 17, E’Twaun Moore had 15 and Ian Clark 11 as the Pelicans finished sweeping a four-game road trip to extend the second-longest current win streak in the NBA.\nThe Houston Rockets won their 17th consecutive game by winning in Milwaukee (110-99) earlier Wednesday. The Rockets’ last loss came against the Pelicans, 115-113, on Jan. 26 in New Orleans .\nDavis, who left the game for good with 3:11 left in the third quarter after twisting his left ankle, had his lowest point total during the win streak. His previous low was 23 points and he had scored more than 40 points five times during the streak.\nAfter sustaining the injury, Davis walked to the locker room without assistance and X-rays on his ankle were negative.\nBuddy Hield scored 20 points, Zach Randolph had 19, Frank Mason III scored 16 and Justin Jackson and Skal Labissiere had 14 each to lead Sacramento , which split the season series against New Orleans as the road team won all four games.\nKings rookie De’Aaron Fox left the game in the first quarter because of lower back stiffness and did not return. Sacramento already was without center Willie Cauley-Stein, who missed his third consecutive game because of a lower back strain.\nDavis, who scored just five points as the Pelicans took an 18-point halftime lead, scored seven of their first nine in the third quarter as they increased the margin to 71-48.\nNew Orleans held an 85-67 lead after three quarters and led by double figures the rest of the way.\nAll eight Pelicans that played in the first quarter scored and they combined to shoot 60.9 percent (14 of 23) in taking a 32-21 lead at the end of the period.\nMirotic made two 3-pointers and converted a three-point play as New Orleans built a 49-29 lead.\nHield scored the next five points and the Kings twice got within 13 before the Pelicans took a 62-44 halftime lead.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
