    "text": "TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Acasta Enterprises Inc. (TSX: AEF) (“ Acasta ” or the “ Company ”) announced today that the Superior Court of Justice (Ontario) approved an arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (the “ OBCA ”) to reduce the stated capital of the Company’s Class B Shares to satisfy requirements under the OBCA related to the repurchase of 26 million Class B Shares in connection with the sale of the Stellwagen business unit (the “ Transaction ”). The Transaction is expected to close on March 26, 2018.\nAdvisories:\nCautionary Note Concerning Forward Looking Statements\nThis news release includes forward looking statements. All such statements constitute forward looking information within the meaning of applicable securities law and are made pursuant to the “safe harbour” provisions of applicable securities laws. Forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, the anticipated timing for the completion of the Transaction, monetizing the PPNs, making the principal payment under the Credit Facility and paying down additional amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility, the termination of lock-up restrictions on the Class B Shares held by certain shareholders and statements about other anticipated future events or results, including comments with respect to Company’s future financial performance and condition. Forward looking statements are statements that are predictive in nature, depend upon or refer to future events or conditions and are identified by words such as “will”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “intends”, “plans”, “believes”, “estimates” or similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. Such statements are based on current expectations of the Company’s management and inherently involve numerous risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, including economic factors. The forward-looking information contained in this news release is presented for the purpose of assisting readers in understanding the Company’s business and strategic priorities and objectives. A number of risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause actual outcomes or financial results to differ materially from the forward looking statements contained in this news release, including, among other factors, those referenced in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in the Company’s annual information form for the year ended December 31, 2016, a copy of which is available on the SEDAR website at www.sedar.com under the Company’s profile. Forward looking statements contained in this news release are not guarantees of future outcomes performance and, while forward looking statements are based on certain assumptions that the Company considers reasonable, actual events could differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements made by the Company. Readers are cautioned to consider these and other factors carefully when making decisions with respect to the Company and to not place undue reliance on forward looking statements. Circumstances affecting the Company may change rapidly. Except as may be expressly required by applicable law, Acasta does not undertake any obligation to update publicly or revise any such forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. These cautionary statements expressly qualify all forward looking statements in this new release.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180323005447/en/\nAcasta Enterprises Inc.\nIan Kidson, 1-647-725-6707\nInterim Chief Executive Officer\nwww.acastaenterprises.com\nSource: Acasta Enterprises Inc.",
