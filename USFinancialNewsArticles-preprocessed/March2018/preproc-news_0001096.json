    "text": "CHICAGO, March 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Methode Electronics, Inc. (NYSE:MEI), a global developer of custom-engineered and application-specific products and solutions, announced financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of Fiscal 2018 ended January 27, 2018.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018\nMethode's third-quarter Fiscal 2018 net sales increased $32.4 million, or 16.6 percent, to $228.0 million from $195.6 million in the same quarter of Fiscal 2017. Year over year, currency rate fluctuations increased net sales $4.4 million.\nNet income decreased $48.0 million to a loss of $24.3 million or $0.65 per share, in the third quarter of Fiscal 2018 from income of $23.7 million, or $0.63 per share, in the same period of Fiscal 2017. In the Fiscal 2018 third quarter, the impact from increased tax expense due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“U.S. Tax Reform”) was $56.8 million, or $1.52 per share.\nYear over year, Fiscal 2018 third-quarter net income was negatively affected by:\nincreased tax expense of $56.8 million, due to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Reform;\nhigher wages expense of $1.6 million;\nincreased intangible asset amortization expense of $1.4 million related to acquisitions;\nwarranty expense in the Automotive segment of $1.0 million;\nhigher interest expense of $0.5 million;\nincreased travel expense of $0.4 million;\ncustomer pricing reductions; and\nunfavorable currency impact.\nYear over year, Fiscal 2018 third-quarter net income benefitted from:\nhigher sales in the Automotive segment (inclusive of new acquisitions);\nreversal of expense for performance-based stock award amortization of $6.0 million due to recent changes regarding Fiscal 2020 EBITDA estimates (driven primarily by the slower adoption of Dabir Surfaces medical devices);\nincreased international government grants of $2.1 million; and\ngain from the sale of a licensing agreement of $1.6 million.\nConsolidated gross margins as a percentage of net sales decreased to 26.4 percent in the Fiscal 2018 third quarter from 27.3 percent in the Fiscal 2017 period. Gross margins declined primarily as a result of sales mix related to newly acquired businesses in the Automotive segment, warranty expense, unfavorable currency impact and pricing reductions in the Automotive and Interface segments.\nSelling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 9.9 percent for the Fiscal 2018 third quarter compared to 12.1 percent in the same period last year. Selling and administrative expenses decreased $1.2 million, or 5.1 percent, to $22.5 million in the Fiscal 2018 third quarter compared to $23.7 million in the prior-year third quarter due primarily to the reversal of the stock award expense as well as the absence of expense related to operating units exited at the end of Fiscal 2017. This was partially offset by expenses from new acquisitions and increases for wages and travel.\nYear over year, intangible asset amortization expense in the third quarter of Fiscal 2018 increased $1.4 million, or 233.3 percent, to $2.0 million, due to new acquisitions.\nIn the Fiscal 2018 third quarter, income tax expense increased $56.8 million to $63.4 million compared to $6.6 million in the Fiscal 2017 third quarter, primarily due to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Reform. The $56.8 million of U.S. Tax Reform expense can be further broken down into provisional estimates of $52.6 million for a one-time repatriation tax and $4.2 million for the re-measurement of U.S. deferred tax assets in the consolidated financial statements. The Company’s effective tax rate increased to 162.1 percent in the Fiscal 2018 period from 21.9 percent in the previous third quarter. The Company’s tax rate excluding the effects of the U.S. Tax Reform charge would have been 16.9 percent for the Fiscal 2018 third quarter.\nSegment Comparisons\nComparing the Automotive segment's Fiscal 2018 third quarter to the same period of Fiscal 2017,\nNet sales improved 22.9 percent, or $34.5 million ($22.0 million from Pacific Insight and $8.5 million from Procoplast), attributable to:\na 53.1 percent sales increase in Europe due to sales from Procoplast, higher customer-funded tooling and design fees, favorable currency impact and higher hidden switch and sensor product volumes; and\na 21.6 percent sales improvement in North America due to sales from Pacific Insight and increased user interface product volume, partially mitigated by lower transmission lead-frame assemblies volume and pricing reductions; partially offset by\nan 8.9 percent sales decrease in Asia due to lower sales of transmission lead-frame assemblies and steering angle sensor product volumes and pricing reductions.\nGross margins as a percentage of sales declined to 27.9 percent from 29.8 percent due to sales mix related to acquisitions, warranty expense, unfavorable currency impact and pricing reductions.\nIncome from operations improved $2.5 million, or 6.8 percent, resulting from higher sales and reversal of the stock award expense, partially offset by increased intangible asset amortization and warranty expense, pricing reductions and unfavorable currency impact.\nComparing the Interface segment's Fiscal 2018 third quarter to the same period of Fiscal 2017,\nNet sales decreased 6.4 percent, or $1.9 million, attributable to:\na 40.0 percent sales decline in Asia due to lower legacy product volume; and\na 6.7 percent sales decrease in North America due to the exit of Connectivity at the end of Fiscal 2017, partially offset by increased radio remote control product volume.\nSales in Europe were constant, as improved radio remote control product volume was offset by decreased data solution product volume.\nGross margins as a percentage of sales decreased to 22.2 percent from 22.8 percent due to pricing reductions and unfavorable currency impact, partially offset by increased radio remote control product volume.\nIncome from operations increased $0.5 million, or 38.5 percent, due to lower legal fees and the reversal of stock award expense, partially offset by unfavorable currency impact.\nComparing the Power Products segment's Fiscal 2018 third quarter to the same period of Fiscal 2017,\nNet sales decreased 1.3 percent, or $0.2 million, attributable to:\nan 8.8 percent sales decrease in North America as the result of lower PowerRail ® and other busbar product volumes; partially offset by\na 10.5 percent sales improvement in Europe driven by new product launches, partially offset by lower bypass switch product volume.\nSales in Asia were constant.\nGross margins as a percentage of sales decreased to 23.7 percent from 26.6 percent, primarily due to higher copper prices.\nIncome from operations declined $0.2 million, or 6.3 percent, as the result of lower sales and unfavorable sales mix, partially offset by the reversal of the stock award expense and lower bad debt expense.\nFirst Nine Months Fiscal 2018\nMethode's first-nine months of Fiscal 2018 net sales increased $62.6 million, or 10.5 percent, to $659.3 million from $596.7 million in the same period of Fiscal 2017. Year over year, currency rate fluctuations increased net sales by $6.5 million.\nNet income decreased $49.3 million to $20.4 million, or $0.54 per share, in the first nine months of Fiscal 2018 from $69.7 million, or $1.86 per share, in the same period of Fiscal 2017. In the first nine months of Fiscal 2018, the impact from increased tax expense due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was $56.8 million, or $1.52 per share.\nYear over year, Fiscal 2018 first-nine month net income was negatively affected by:\nincreased tax expense of $56.8 million, due to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Reform;\nacquisition-related expenses and purchase accounting adjustments of $6.8 million;\nincreased wages and other compensation expenses of $2.1 million;\nincreased intangible asset amortization expense of $1.9 million related to acquisitions;\nincreased investment in Dabir Surfaces of $1.8 million;\nthe absence of commodity pricing adjustments in the Automotive segment of $1.0 million;\nthe absence of one-time reversal of accruals related to customer commercial issues in the Automotive segment of $1.0 million;\nwarranty expense in the Automotive segment of $1.0 million;\ncustomer pricing reductions;\nunfavorable currency impact; and\nunfavorable commodity pricing of certain raw materials.\nYear over year, Fiscal 2018 first-nine month net income benefitted from:\nhigher sales in the Automotive (inclusive of new acquisitions) and Power Products segments;\nreversal of expense for performance-based stock award amortization of $6.0 million due to recent changes regarding Fiscal 2020 EBITDA estimates (driven primarily by slower adoption of Dabir Surfaces medical devices);\ngain from the sale of rights for a licensing agreement of $1.6 million; and\nincreased international government grants of $0.6 million.\nConsolidated gross margins as a percentage of sales decreased slightly to 27.0 percent in the Fiscal 2018 nine months from 27.3 percent in the Fiscal 2017 nine months. Gross margins in the Fiscal 2018 period were negatively impacted by unfavorable sales mix related to acquisitions, warranty expense, purchase accounting adjustments, unfavorable currency impact, pricing reductions, higher commodity pricing on certain raw materials and increased investment in Dabir, partially offset by higher sales. Gross margins were favorably impacted in the Fiscal 2017 period by the commodity pricing adjustments and reversal of customer commercial accruals.\nSelling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 12.6 percent for the Fiscal 2018 first nine months compared to 12.8 percent in the same period last year. Selling and administrative expenses increased $6.9 million, or 9.0 percent, to $83.3 million in the Fiscal 2018 first nine months compared to $76.4 million in the prior-year period, due primarily to acquisition-related expense, additional selling and administrative expenses from acquisitions and higher wages and travel expenses, partially mitigated by the reversal of the stock award expense and the absence of expense related to operating units exited at the end of Fiscal 2017.\nYear over year intangible asset amortization expense in the Fiscal 2018 nine months increased $1.9 million, or 105.6 percent, to $3.7 million, due to new acquisitions.\nIn the first nine months of Fiscal 2018, income tax expense increased $54.3 million to $72.6 million compared to $18.3 million in the Fiscal 2017 period primarily due to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Reform. Of the total income tax expense of $72.6 million recorded during the Fiscal 2018 nine months, $56.8 million relates to U.S. Tax Reform. This can be further broken down into provisional estimates of $52.6 million for a one-time repatriation tax and $4.2 million for the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets in the consolidated financial statements. The Company’s effective tax rate increased to 78.1 percent in the Fiscal 2018 period from 20.8 percent in the previous period. The Company’s tax rate excluding the effects of Tax Reform charge would have been 17.0 percent for the nine months of Fiscal 2018.\nSegment Comparisons\nComparing the Automotive segment's Fiscal 2018 nine months to the same period of Fiscal 2017,\nNet sales increased 14.4 percent, or $66.5 million ($29.0 million from Pacific Insight and $17.6 million from Procoplast), attributable to:\na 41.6 percent sales improvement in Europe due to sales from Procoplast, increased customer- funded tooling and design fees, favorable currency impact and higher hidden switch and sensor product volumes; and\na 10.5 percent sales increase in North America due to sales from Pacific Insight and higher user- interface sales volumes, partially offset by center console pricing reductions, net of higher sales volumes and decreased transmission lead-frame assemblies volume and pricing reductions; partially offset by\nan 8.9 percent sales decrease in Asia due to lower transmission lead-frame assemblies and steering angle sensor product volumes and pricing reductions.\nGross margins as a percentage of sales declined to 28.4 percent from 29.5 percent due to unfavorable sales mix due to acquisitions, warranty expense, purchase accounting adjustments, pricing reductions, and unfavorable currency impact. Gross margins in the Fiscal 2017 period were favorably impacted by commodity pricing adjustments and one-time reversal of accruals related to customer commercial issues.\nIncome from operations increased $6.9 million, or 6.2 percent, as the result of increased sales and the reversal of stock award expense, partially offset by acquisition-related costs, increased intangible asset amortization expense, warranty expense, pricing reductions, unfavorable currency impact, the absence of the Fiscal 2017 favorable commodity pricing adjustments and one-time reversal of accruals, and higher severance and travel expenses.\nComparing the Interface segment's Fiscal 2018 first nine months to the same period of Fiscal 2017,\nNet sales decreased 9.1 percent, or $8.6 million, attributable to:\na 41.4 percent sales decline in Asia due to lower legacy product volume; and\na 12.7 percent sales decrease in North America due to the exit of Connectivity at the end of Fiscal 2017, partially mitigated by higher radio remote control and data solutions product volumes; partially offset by\na 10.3 percent sales improvement in Europe as the result of increased radio remote control product volume, partially offset by lower data solution product volume and pricing reductions.\nGross margins as a percentage of sales improved to 22.0 percent from 21.6 percent due to favorable sales mix, partially mitigated by lower sales volume and price reductions.\nIncome from operations increased to $4.0 million from a loss of $0.1 million due to favorable sales mix, lower legal expenses and the reversal of stock award expense, partially offset by lower sales volumes.\nComparing the Power Products segment's Fiscal 2018 first nine months to the same period of Fiscal 2017,\nNet sales increased 12.3 percent, or $4.9 million, attributable to:\na 93.0 percent sales improvement in Europe driven by higher bypass switch product volume;\na 7.1 percent sales increase in Asia due to higher busbar product volume; partially offset by\na 2.9 percent sales decrease in North America.\nGross margins as a percentage of sales decreased to 25.9 percent from 26.3 percent due to unfavorable copper pricing, partially offset by higher sales.\nIncome from operations improved $1.6 million, or 20.8 percent, as the result of increased sales, the reversal of stock award expense and lower legal fees, partially mitigated by unfavorable copper pricing.\nGuidance\nMethode updated Fiscal 2018 guidance for sales to the range of $900 million to $910 million from a range of $880 million to $900 million, pre-tax income from operations to the range of $125 to $130 million from $114 to $127 million and earnings per share (inclusive of the U.S. Tax Reform charge) to the range of $1.23 to $1.33 from $2.43 to $2.63. The U.S. Tax Reform charge will negatively impact Fiscal 2018 earnings per share by $1.52.\nThe guidance ranges for Fiscal 2018 are based upon management's expectations regarding a variety of factors and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the following:\nsales volumes and timing thereof for certain makes and models of pickup trucks, sports utility vehicles and passenger cars;\nprice of commodities, particularly copper and resins;\npotential effect of increased legal fees related to the Hetronic lawsuit;\nsales mix within the markets served;\ncurrency exchange effect of the operations of foreign businesses;\ncontinued ability to realize manufacturing efficiencies;\nno significant supplier issues or manufacturing quality events;\nno unusual or one-time items;\nno additional acquisitions, divestitures or restructuring charges; and\nchanges to technical guidance or assumptions associated with the provisional tax estimate of U.S. tax reform.\nManagement Comments\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer Donald W. Duda said, “While tax reform will not dramatically change Methode’s tax rate, we believe it will provide much greater flexibility in how we manage our cash internationally.”\nMr. Duda concluded, “We remain very confident in our Dabir medical business, however, the pace and timing of its adoption continues to be constrained by the pace at which health systems adopt new products.”\nConference Call\nThe Company will conduct a conference call and Webcast to review financial and operational highlights led by its President and Chief Executive Officer, Donald W.
