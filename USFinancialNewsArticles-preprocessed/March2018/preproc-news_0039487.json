    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Scott+Scott Attorneys at Law LLP (“Scott+Scott”), a national shareholder and consumer rights litigation firm, has filed a class action lawsuit against Facebook, Inc. (“Facebook” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: FB) and certain of its executives (collectively, “Defendants”). If you purchased or otherwise acquired common shares of Facebook between February 3, 2017 and March 19, 2018, both dates inclusive (the “Class Period”), you are encouraged to contact a Scott+Scott attorney at (844) 818-6982 for more information.\nThe lawsuit alleges that, during the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Facebook violated its own purported data privacy policies by allowing third parties to access the personal data of millions of Facebook users without the users’ consent; (ii) discovery of the foregoing conduct would foreseeably subject the Company to heightened regulatory scrutiny; and (iii) as a result, Facebook’s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.\nOn March 17, 2018, The New York Times reported that voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica “harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network’s history.”\nThe next day, March 18, 2018, the Massachusetts Attorney General said her office was launching an investigation into Facebook. On March 19, 2018, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and European Union officials also said they would investigate.\nOn this news, the price of Facebook stock fell nearly 6.8% on March 19, 2018.\nOn March 20, 2018, several media outlets reported that the United Kingdom Parliament had summoned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to give evidence related to the Cambridge Analytica news.\nFollowing these news reports, Facebook’s share price fell an additional $4.41, or 2.5%, on March 20, 2018.\nAs of market close on March 22, 2018, the stock price had fallen to $164.89, a 10.9% drop from the March 16, 2018 close price.\nWhat You Can Do\nIf you wish to discuss this action or have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests, please contact plaintiff’s counsel, Joe Pettigrew of Scott+Scott at (844) 818-6982, or at jpettigrew@scott-scott.com . The lead plaintiff deadline is May 21, 2018.\nAbout Scott+Scott Attorneys at Law LLP\nScott+Scott has significant experience in prosecuting major securities, antitrust, and employee retirement plan actions throughout the United States. The firm represents pension funds, foundations, individuals, and other entities worldwide with offices in New York, London, Connecticut, California, and Ohio.\nAttorney Advertising\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180323005554/en/\nScott+Scott Attorneys at Law LLP\nJoe Pettigrew, 844-818-6982\njpettigrew@scott-scott.com\nSource: Scott+Scott Attorneys at Law LLP",
