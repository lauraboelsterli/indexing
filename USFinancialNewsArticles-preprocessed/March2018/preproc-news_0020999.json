It is up 1.26 percent for the week.\n* The Canadian economy added 15,400 jobs in February after a big loss in January, but full-time positions shrank and wage growth decelerated.\n* Ivanhoe Mines Ltd was the biggest gainer on the TSX, rising 6 percent.\n* The 10 best performers on the index were dominated by energy and mining companies, including Pretium Resources , Detour Gold and Freehold Royalties.\n* Copper futures advanced 1.8 percent to $6,957.50 a tonne, while U.S. oil futures jumped 3.2 percent to $62.03 a barrel.\n* Gold futures reversed earlier losses to trade up 0.1 percent at $1,323.50 an ounce.\n* Even so, Yamana Gold was the biggest decliner on the index, falling 5.6 percent. New Gold Inc and IAMGOLD Corp were also among the biggest losers, losing 3.4 percent and 2.4 percent respectively.\n* The world stocks index added 1.1 percent. The Nasdaq pulled up 1.7 percent to close at an all-time high as fears of inflation and aggressive interest rate hikes ebbed after a slowdown in wage growth.\n* The TSX consumer non-cyclicals group was the sector with the most gains, rising 0.7 percent, while the healthcare group posted the biggest declines, falling 0.45 percent.\n* Yamana Gold and Bombardier Inc were the most actively traded stocks on the index.\n* There were 146 advancing issues and 92 declining ones. Twelve were flat. (Reporting by Nichola Saminather; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Richard Chang)\n ",
