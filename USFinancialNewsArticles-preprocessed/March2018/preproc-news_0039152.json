    "text": "DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Alerian Energy Infrastructure ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund) (NYSE: ENFR) declared its first quarter distribution on March 21, 2018 in the amount of $0.17445. The dividend is payable on March 29, 2018 to shareholders of record on March 23, 2018.\nENFR Distribution:\n• Ex-Date: Thursday, March 22, 2018\n• Record Date: Friday, March 23, 2018\n• Payable Date: Thursday, March 29, 2018\nAdditional Fund Information can be found at www.alpsfunds.com/ENFR\nImportant Disclosures\nAn investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses carefully before investing. To obtain a prospectus that contains this and other information call 866.675.2639. Read the prospectus carefully before you invest.\nThere are risks involved with investing in ETFs including the loss of money. Additional information regarding the risks of this investment is available in the prospectus.\nThe Alerian Energy Infrastructure ETF Shares are not individually redeemable. Investors buy and sell shares of the Alerian Energy Infrastructure ETF on a secondary market. Only market makers or “authorized participants” may trade directly with the Fund, typically in blocks of 50,000 shares.\nThe Fund’s concentration in securities of MLPs involves risks that differ from investments in common stock, including risks related to: (1) limited control and rights to vote on matters affecting the MLP; (2) potential conflicts of interest between the MLP and its general partner; (3) cash flow; (4) dilution; and (5) the general partner’s limited call right. Actual results, performance or events may also be affected by, without limitation, (1) general economic conditions, (2) performance of financial markets, (3) interest rate levels, (4) changes in laws and regulations and (5) changes in the policies of governments and/or regulatory authorities. An investor’s shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. MLPs may have additional expenses, as some MLPs pay incentive distribution fees to their general partners. Infrastructure companies are subject to risks specific to the industry they serve including, but not limited to commodity price fluctuations; reduced volumes of energy commodities available for transporting, processing, storing or distributing; changes in the economy or regulatory environment; and extreme weather. The Fund invests primarily in energy infrastructure companies which may be adversely affected by changes in worldwide energy prices, exploration, production spending, government regulation, changes in exchange rates and depletion of natural resources.\nThe Fund may be subject to risks relating to its investment in Canadian securities. Because the Fund will invest in securities denominated in foreign currencies and the income received by the Fund will generally be in foreign currency, changes in currency exchange rates may negatively impact the Fund’s return.\nALPS Portfolio Solutions Distributor, Inc. is the Distributor of the Fund.\nAbout ALPS\nALPS provides customized asset servicing and asset gathering solutions to the financial services community through an entrepreneurial culture based on the commitment to “Do Things Right.” Founded in 1985, ALPS continues to actively promote all of its various business segments, from asset servicing through ALPS Fund Services, Inc. to asset gathering through ALPS Distributors, Inc. and ALPS Advisors, Inc.
