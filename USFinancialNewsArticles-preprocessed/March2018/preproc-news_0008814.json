    "text": "Expands into the field of active safety testing\nFARMINGTON HILLS, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Humanetics Innovative Solutions, Inc., the global leader in safety testing and developer of biofidelic crash test dummies, simulation software models and custom sensor solutions, is pleased to announce the acquisition of DSD Testing GmbH, a leading manufacturer of advanced safety test equipment. Through the acquisition of DSD Testing, Humanetics adds critical tools used by automotive OEMs and suppliers as well as government and testing facilities to evaluate advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles.\nFounded in 1990 in Linz, Austria, DSD has built a reputation as one of the most highly respected providers of advanced test equipment, serving an extensive list of top automotive OEMs and Tier I suppliers. DSD Testing was previously a part of Dr. Steffan Datentechnik GmbH (DSD GmbH), which also includes the PC-Crash software business and specialty outdoor testing services, both of which will remain with DSD GmbH. Markus Schmidl, current DSD Testing COO, will lead the business with the current team in Linz, while DSD founder, Dr. Hermann Steffan, will continue to support the company post-closing.\n“As a global leader in the field of safety, we are excited about expanding our offering of the industry’s most advanced active safety testing equipment. With this equipment, we are able to support our customers in their development of crash avoidance systems and Automated Driving Systems (ADS),” said Christopher J. O’Connor, President & CEO of Humanetics. “At Humanetics, our goals are to provide our customers with superior service and create products that save lives. We believe DSD Testing’s advanced safety equipment is a natural addition to further our mission.”\nDSD Testing’s product offering includes advanced active safety test equipment such as Ultra-Flat Overrunable (UFO) platform robots, soft target vehicle dummies, and steering and pedal driving robots. The remotely operated, GPS enabled UFO system allows vehicle manufacturers to test the latest advanced accident avoidance systems in real world scenarios. With a height of less than 100mm, the company’s highly rugged, sleek UFO robotic platform can be repeatedly driven over by a vehicle without damaging the car or platform. Steering and pedal robots apply precise and repeatable inputs to control the test vehicle, thereby removing the variability that comes from a human driver. Working in tandem, the UFOs and driving robots offer a true driverless testing solution.\nIn addition to its line-up of active safety products, DSD Testing manufactures intrusion cylinders, advanced side-impact systems (ASIS) and crash blocks for select passive safety testing applications. The company also provides indoor testing services at its laboratory in Linz, which is equipped with a modern 2MN Hyper-G catapult system and a unique, controlled intrusion system.\nDr. Steffan commented, “As a pre-eminent global safety supplier, Humanetics is the perfect partner for DSD Testing. It has the scale, global network, customer relationships and sector experience to take this business to the next level and accelerate the sales growth for DSD Testing products in all markets worldwide. By combining with Humanetics, DSD Testing can continue with its product development initiatives and fully support the growing global need for our important safety products.”\nFinancial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.\nAbout Humanetics Innovative Solutions, Inc.\nFor over 65 years, Humanetics has been the leading global designer, manufacturer and supplier of crash test dummies and calibration equipment, crash sensors and instrumentation and crash simulation software models. Additionally, Humanetics sister companies develop and supply custom force, load, torque and pressure electrical strain gage and fiber optic sensor solutions and provide advanced strain gage application services. Humanetics serves industry leaders in a variety of high-growth markets including automotive, aviation, energy, medical, military and civil infrastructure. In the automotive sector alone, Humanetics serves 100% of the OEMs and Tier I safety suppliers worldwide. Humanetics has over 650 employees across 20 facilities strategically located around the world with the global corporate headquarters situated in Farmington Hills, Michigan, USA.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180305005313/en/\nHumanetics Innovative Solutions, Inc.\nBryan Brown, Director of Corporate Development\nbbrown@humaneticsatd.com\n734.446.3144\nor\nMichael Jarouche, VP Global Sales & Marketing\nmjarouche@humaneticsatd.com\n734.446.3106\nSource: Humanetics Innovative Solutions, Inc.",
