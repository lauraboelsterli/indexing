These forward-looking statements are based upon management's current beliefs and expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances and contain words such as \"believe,\" \"intended,\" \"expect,\" and \"anticipate,\" and include statements about expectations for future results.\nThe forward-looking statements involve risks that may affect the Company's operations, markets, products, services, prices and other risk factors discussed in the Company's filings with the SEC, including those under the heading entitled \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. Significant risks and uncertainties may relate to, but are not limited to, the risk that the transaction (the \"Cristal Transaction\") contemplated by the transaction agreement, by and among the Company, The National Titanium Dioxide Company Ltd., a limited company organized under the laws of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Cristal Inorganic Chemicals Netherlands Coöperatief W.A., a cooperative organized under the laws of the Netherlands and a wholly owned subsidiary of Cristal (as amended, the \"Amended Transaction Agreement\") will not close, including by failure to obtain any necessary financing or the failure to satisfy other closing conditions under the Amended Transaction Agreement or by the termination of the Amended Transaction Agreement; failure to plan and manage the Cristal Transaction effectively and efficiently; the risk that a regulatory approval that may be required for the Cristal Transaction is delayed, is not obtained or is obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated; the risk that expected synergies will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; unanticipated increases in financing and other costs, including a rise in interest rates; reduced access to unrestricted cash; compliance with our bank facility covenants; the price of our shares; general market conditions; our customers potentially reducing their demand for our products; more competitive pricing from our competitors or increased supply from our competitors; operating efficiencies and other benefits expected from the Cristal Transaction.
