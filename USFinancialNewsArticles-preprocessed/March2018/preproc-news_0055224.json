    "text": "Fast-Growing Workspace Provider Continues Adding Talent as Momentum Increases\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Knotel , the flexible workspace provider that creates custom offices for established businesses, announced today that Sanjiv Sanghavi has been named the company’s first VP of Product. In this role, Sanjiv will lead the team building the next generation of workspace products and experiences.\nSanjiv brings a prolific career as a product thinker and builder to Knotel. In 2011, Sanjiv co-founded ClassPass, the leading health and wellness brand that has raised over $150 million. Sanjiv also founded Tulip, the consumer-friendly oral care brand that combines patented dental products with gourmet flavors, in 2015.\n“We’re thrilled to bring someone as accomplished and talented as Sanjiv into a crucial role at Knotel at a critical time,” says Amol Sarva, co-founder and CEO of Knotel. “His addition will enable us to deliver more value to our customers while building an even stronger team thanks to his electric mind and his natural desire to mentor those around him. We can’t wait for him to get started.”\nJoining Knotel was an easy decision for Sanjiv.\n“Knotel struck me as incredibly ambitious and stood out to me among all the white noise in the market,” Sanjiv explains. “Throughout my career, I’ve focused on creating and building companies that challenge the status quo and engage with consumers in unconventional ways. Knotel is the office model of the future and I can’t wait to begin working on the next phase in our expansion.”\nSanjiv joins Knotel on the heels of Rachel Meranus’ hire as first-ever CMO in February 2018.\nIn the past year, Knotel has seen incredible growth. After raising a $25 million Series A in February 2017, Knotel launched in new markets, signed partnerships with two coworking firms, tripled the size of its Manhattan real estate portfolio and grew its footprint to more than 800,000 square feet of space.\nAbout Knotel\nKnotel is reinventing the commercial real estate market with its “workspace as a service” model. Making long-term leases a thing of the past, Knotel designs, builds, and operates custom spaces for growing and established companies on flexible terms, freeing them from weighty commitments so they can focus on their businesses and cultures.\nNamed a Business Insider Top 50 Startup in 2018 and New York's Hottest New Workspace Model in 2017, Knotel has raised $25 million in funding and operates 800,000 square feet of space across New York, San Francisco, and London. Knotel’s 2,000+ member network includes companies like Cheddar, Stash, The Body Shop, Starbucks, and Teachable.
