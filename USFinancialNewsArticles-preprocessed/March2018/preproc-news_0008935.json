    "text": "Admiral Schofield scored 23 points, including a clutch jumper with 17 seconds to play, as No. 16 Tennessee beat Georgia 66-61 and won a share of the SEC regular-season title Saturday at Thompson-Boling Arena in Knoxville, Tenn.\nJordan Bowden hit a pair of free throws to give Tennessee a one-point lead with one minute left, and Schofield hit a turnaround jumper on the Vols’ next possession to help seal the win.\nIt’s the first SEC title for Tennessee since 2008.\nGrant Williams finished with 22 points before fouling out with 3:33 to play, and Lamonte Turner hit three big 3-pointers to rally the Vols back from a nine-point deficit in the second half.\nSchofield energized the crowd and capped an 8-0 run with an extra-effort steal that led to a one-handed dunk to cut Georgia’s lead to 45-44 with 13 minutes left in the second half.\nThe Bulldogs (16-14, 7-11 SEC) went more than six minutes in the second half without scoring as Tennessee climbed back into the game. Turner hit a 3-pointer to tie the score 49-49 at the 10-minute mark.\nTurner hit another 3-pointer four minutes later that gave Tennessee (23-7, 13-5 SEC) its first lead since early in the first half.\nYante Maten led Georgia with 18 points and nine rebounds, and Rayshaun Hammonds added 12 points.\nIn a physical first half, Maten and William Jackson II hit jumpers on consecutive possessions to help Georgia build a 27-19 lead with seven minutes left before intermission. The Bulldogs’ lead grew to 11 on a layup by Tyree Crump before Tennessee guard Jordan Bone hit a 3-pointer from the left wing to bring the Vols back within 42-34 at halftime.\nThe Volunteers snapped a five-game losing streak to Georgia and have won four in a row heading to the SEC tournament. They will be the second seed in the tourney, which tips off Wednesday in St. Louis, Mo.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
