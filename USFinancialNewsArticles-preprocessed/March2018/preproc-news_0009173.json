Such investors are encouraged to join this case by visiting the firm's site: http://www.bgandg.com/ubnt .\nThis class action seeks to recover damages against Defendants for alleged violations of the federal securities laws under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nThe Complaint alleges that, throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the number of the Company's purported user community was drastically overstated; (2) Ubiquiti had exaggerated its publicly reported accounts receivable; and (3) as a result of the foregoing, Ubiquiti's publicly disseminated financial statements were materially false and misleading.\nOn September 18, 2017, Citron Research (\"Citron\") issued a report entitled \"Cintron Exposes Ubiquiti Networks,\" (the \"Citron Report\") in which Citron detailed a series of \"alarming red flags,\" indicating that the Company had been deceiving investors and was engaged in \"corporate fraud,\" including, among other things, that the Company had misrepresented the size of its purported \"Ubiquiti Community,\" as well as its levels of accounts receivable, among other things.\nOn February 20, 2018, Ubiquiti announced that it had received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission \"requesting documents and information relating to a range of topics including metrics relating to the Ubiquiti Community, accounting practices, financial information, auditors, international trade practices, and relationships with distributors and various other third parties.\" Following the news of the SEC subpoenas, Ubiquiti's share price fell more than 25 percent, from $74.04 at the close of the prior trading day, to close at $55.28 on February 20, 2018.\nA class action lawsuit has already been filed.
