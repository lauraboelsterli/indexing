    "text": "FRIEDBERG, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- voxeljet AG (NYSE: VJET) (the “Company”, or “voxeljet”), a leading provider of high-speed, large-format 3D printers and on-demand parts services to industrial and commercial customers, today announced consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights\nTotal revenues for the full year increased 3.8% to kEUR 23,178 from kEUR 22,338 Total revenues for the fourth quarter decreased 2.7% to kEUR 6,108 from kEUR 6,275 Systems revenues for the fourth quarter decreased 20.0% to kEUR 3,146 from kEUR 3,934 Services revenues for the fourth quarter increased 26.5% to kEUR 2,962 from kEUR 2,341 Total gross profit and gross profit margin for the fourth quarter increased to kEUR 2,446 from kEUR 1,254 and to 40% from 20%, respectively First quarter ended March 31, 2018 revenue expected to be between kEUR 4,500 and kEUR 5,500 Reaffirm full year 2018 guidance\nDr. Ingo Ederer, Chief Executive Officer of voxeljet, commented: “Our vision is clear: we want to replace conventional production by constantly pushing technological boundaries. We want to bring our 3D printing technology into fully automated mass manufacturing. Throughout 2017, we have made significant progress in this regard and I am incredibly enthusiastic about the solutions in our lineup. In 2018, we will continue the execution of our strategy, so you can reasonably expect more innovations and more partnerships with a strong focus on bringing these innovations to their full potential.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased by 2.7% to kEUR 6,108 compared to kEUR 6,275 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nRevenues from our Systems segment, which focuses on the development, production and sale of 3D printers, decreased 20.0% to kEUR 3,146 in the fourth quarter of 2017 from kEUR 3,934 in last year’s fourth quarter. The Company delivered one new and three used and refurbished 3D printer in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to six new 3D printers delivered in last year’s fourth quarter. The decrease in revenue was mainly due to the lower number of printer sales. Systems revenues also include all revenues from consumables, spare parts and maintenance. Systems revenues represented 51.5% of total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 62.7% in last year’s fourth quarter.\nRevenues from our Services segment, which focuses on the printing of on-demand parts for our customers, increased 26.5%, to kEUR 2,962 in the fourth quarter of 2017 from kEUR 2,341 in the comparative period of 2016. This was mainly due to higher revenue contribution from our subsidiaries, voxeljet America Inc. (“voxeljet America”) and voxeljet China Co. Ltd (“voxeljet China”), which was established during the second quarter of 2016. The increase in revenue at our American and Chinese service centers resulted from a growing market penetration in the respective sales regions which is accompanied by a bigger customer base. In addition, revenue contribution from our German service center significantly increased. Revenue from our subsidiary voxeljet UK Ltd. (“voxeljet UK”) almost remained on the same level compared to the last year’s same period.\nCost of sales was kEUR 3,662 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to kEUR 5,021 for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGross profit was kEUR 2,446 in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to kEUR 1,254 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGross profit for our Systems segment increased to kEUR 1,059 in the fourth quarter of 2017 from kEUR 379 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The gross profit margin for this segment increased to 33.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 9.6% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The improvement mainly relates to the reserve for slow-moving inventory which was established in the fourth quarter of 2016 amounting to kEUR 954, recognized in cost of sales. Due to the reduction of work in progress resulting from the adjustment of production according to the market demand, the reserve has partially been reversed within the business year 2017 impacting the fourth quarter of 2017 by an amount of kEUR 191.\nGross profit for our Services segment increased to kEUR 1,387 in the fourth quarter of 2017 from kEUR 875 in the fourth quarter of 2016. This was mainly due to the increase in revenues. The gross profit margin for this segment increased to 46.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 37.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The gross profit and gross profit margin contribution from voxeljet China significantly improved. The German service center contributed higher gross profit while gross profit margin remained approximately on the same level. Gross profit contribution from voxeljet America as well as voxeljet UK remained almost unchanged.\nSelling expenses were kEUR 2,074 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to kEUR 1,638 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase of kEUR 436 was mainly related to increased personnel expenses related to higher headcount for our sales force.\nAdministrative expenses were kEUR 1,427 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to kEUR 1,200 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was mainly related to higher consulting fees in connection with the preparation of several financing activities.\nResearch and development (“R&D”) expenses decreased to kEUR 1,574 in the fourth quarter of 2017 from kEUR 1,840 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease of kEUR 266 was mainly due to lower expenses related to material and external services for various projects compared to the last year’s same period. Those expenses are usually driven by individual projects and might differ on a quarter to quarter comparison.\nOther operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were kEUR 239 compared to kEUR 35 in the prior year period. This was mainly related to higher losses from foreign currency transactions, which were primarily driven by the valuation of the intercompany loans granted by the parent company to our US and UK subsidiary.\nOther operating income was kEUR 235 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to kEUR 569 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease was mainly due to lower gains from foreign currency transactions, which were primarily driven by the valuation of the intercompany loans granted by the parent company to our US and UK subsidiary.\nOperating loss was kEUR 2,633 in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to an operating loss of kEUR 2,890 in the comparative period in 2016. The improvement was mainly due to higher gross margin from both the Systems and the Services segments. Additionally the research and development expenses decreased. This was partially offset by increased selling expenses as well as administrative expenses.\nFinancial result was a positive of kEUR 253 in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a negative financial result of kEUR 71 in the comparative period in 2016. This was mainly due to finance income from the revaluation of the embedded derivative related to the Performance Participation Interest in connection with the first tranche of the loan received by the European Investment Bank.\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was kEUR 2,460 or EUR 0.66 per share, as compared to net loss of kEUR 2,961, or EUR 0.80 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nBased on a conversion rate of five American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) per ordinary share, net loss is EUR 0.13 per ADS for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to EUR 0.16 per ADS from the comparative period of 2016.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Results\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 3.8% to kEUR 23,178 compared to kEUR 22,338 in the prior year period.\nSystems revenues were kEUR 11,534 year ended December 31, 2017 compared to kEUR 13,081 in last year’s period. The Company sold ten new and five used and refurbished 3D printers during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to fifteen new and three used and refurbished 3D printers in the prior year period. The decrease in Systems revenues was mainly due to the lower number of 3D printer sales. Systems revenues represented 49.8% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 58.6% for the last year’s same period.\nServices revenues were kEUR 11,644 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to kEUR 9,257 for the same period last year. This increase was mainly due to a higher revenue contribution from the German operation and our subsidiaries voxeljet America and voxeljet China, which was established during the second quarter of 2016. The main driver for the increase is the German operation, showing growth which was approximately three times the increase from voxeljet America and voxeljet China. The increase in revenue at our German service center is due to the robust economy on the European market. The revenue growth at our American service center resulted from a growing market penetration in the respective sales regions, accompanied by a bigger customer base. This was partially offset by a lower revenue contribution from voxeljet UK.\nCost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 was kEUR 13,824, a decrease of kEUR 1,611, or 10% compared to cost of sales amounting to kEUR 15,435 for the same period in 2016.\nGross profit and gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 were kEUR 9,354 and 40.4%, respectively, compared to kEUR 6,903 and 30.9%, respectively, in the prior year period.\nGross profit for our Systems segment increased to kEUR 3,921 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from kEUR 3,197 in the same period of 2016. The gross profit margin for this segment increased to 34.0% compared to 24.4% for the prior period. The improvement within the System segment was mainly related to the reduction in the reserve for slow-moving inventory with a positive impact of kEUR 515 in 2017, compared to a charge to cost of sales in 2016 of kEUR 954. Due to the reduction of work in progress resulting from the adjustment of production according to the market demand, the reserve has partially been reversed within the business year 2017 with an amount of kEUR 515.\nGross profit for our Services segment increased to kEUR 5,433 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from kEUR 3,706 in the same period of 2016. The gross profit margin for this segment increased to 46.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 40.0% for the same period in 2016. In our Services segment, we received higher gross profit contribution from the German operation, our subsidiaries voxeljet America, as well as voxeljet China. Gross profit from voxeljet America improved due to a higher utilization rate of our service center.\nSelling expenses were kEUR 6,474 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to kEUR 5,312 in the same period in 2016, a increase of kEUR 1,162, or 21.9%. This was related to higher personnel expenses in connection with an increase in headcount.\nAdministrative expenses increased by kEUR 566, or 12.4% to kEUR 5,129 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from kEUR 4,563 in the prior year period. This increase is mainly due to higher expenses for the preparation of several financing activities.\nResearch and development expenses slightly decreased to kEUR 5,528 for the year ended December 31, 2017 from kEUR 5,683 in the same period in 2016, a decrease of kEUR 155, or 2.7%.\nOther operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were kEUR 1,844 compared to kEUR 3,881 in the prior year period. This improvement was mainly due to the one-time impairment charges of kEUR 1,423 recorded in the third quarter of 2016. Foreign currency losses amounted to kEUR 1,585 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to kEUR 2,077 in the same period in 2016.\nThe losses from foreign currency transactions were primarily driven by the valuation of the intercompany loans granted by the parent company to our US and UK subsidiaries.\nOther operating income was kEUR 1,001 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to kEUR 1,417 in the prior year period. The decrease was mainly due to lower gains from foreign currency transactions of kEUR 135 in 2017 compared to kEUR 645 in 2016.\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was kEUR 8,525, or EUR 2.29 per share, as compared to net loss of kEUR 11,313, or EUR 3.04 per share in the prior year period. This is based on a weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding of 3.720 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Compared to the last year’s same period, the number of ordinary shares outstanding was unchanged.\nBased on a conversion rate of five ADSs per ordinary share, net loss was EUR 0.46 per ADS for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net loss of EUR 0.61 per ADS in the prior year period.\nBusiness Outlook\nOur revenue guidance for the first quarter of 2018 is projected to be in the range of kEUR 4,500 to kEUR 5,500. We expect to release our financial results for the first quarter of 2018 after the closing of the financial markets on Thursday, May 17, 2018 and we will host a conference call and webcast to review the results for the quarter on Friday, May 18, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.\nWe reaffirm our guidance for the full year ended December 31, 2018.\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of kEUR 28,000 and kEUR 30,000 Gross margin is expected to be above 40% Operating expenses for the full year are expected as follows: SG&A expenses expected to be in the range of kEUR 11,000 and kEUR 12,000 and R&D expenses expected to be between approximately kEUR 5,000 to kEUR 6,000. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to be between kEUR 3,750 and kEUR 4,000. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be neutral-to-positive in 2018. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of foreign exchange valuations. Capital expenditures are projected to be in the range of kEUR 5,500 to kEUR 6,500, which primarily includes ongoing investments in our global subsidiaries.\nOur total backlog of 3D printer orders at December 31, 2017 was kEUR 2,770, which represents four 3D printers. This compares to a backlog of kEUR 3,784 representing five 3D printers, at December 31, 2016. As production and delivery of our printers is generally characterized by lead times ranging between three to nine months, the conversion rate of order backlog into revenue is dependent on the equipping process for the respective 3D printer as well as the timing of customers’ requested deliveries.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of kEUR 7,569 and held kEUR 14,044 of investments in bond funds, which are included in current financial assets on our consolidated statements of financial position.\nWebcast and Conference Call Details\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast to review the results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017 on Friday, March 30, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.
