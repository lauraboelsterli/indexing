    "text": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- USG Corporation (NYSE:USG) today announced that its Board of Directors, advised by its financial and legal advisors, has unanimously rejected the unsolicited and non-binding proposal disclosed today by Gebr. Knauf KG (“Knauf”) to acquire all of the shares of USG for $42.00 per share in cash. The Board carefully evaluated it and determined that it substantially undervalues the Company and is not in the best interests of all of USG’s shareholders.\n“Our Board is always looking for ways to deliver value to all of our shareholders, but Knauf’s opportunistically timed proposal is wholly inadequate as it does not reflect USG’s intrinsic value, including the significant opportunities ahead of us,” said Steven Leer, USG’s non-executive chairman of the Board. “We are confident that the strategy we presented on March 8, 2018 at our Investor Day will deliver significantly more value to our shareholders than Knauf’s proposal.”\nJennifer Scanlon, president and chief executive officer of USG, added, “USG has taken significant steps over the last two years to transform our company, our products and our balance sheet, while lowering our cost structure and improving our competitive position. As outlined at our investor day, we expect our strategy to drive further revenue growth, margin expansion and free cash flow – all of which will position us to deliver profitable growth and increased shareholder value.”\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC are serving as financial advisors to USG, and Jones Day is serving as legal advisor to USG.\nThe USG Board communicated its decision in the following letter to Knauf:\nMarch 26, 2018\nAlexander Knauf, General Partner and\nManfred Grundke, General Partner\nGebr. Knauf KG\nAm Bahnhof 7\n97346 Iphofen\nGermany\nDear Alexander and Manfred,\nIn response to your revised proposal letter dated March 15 our Board, together with our financial and legal advisors, thoroughly analyzed your proposal and unanimously determined that $42 per share is wholly inadequate, as it substantially undervalues the Company and is not in the best interests of all of USG’s shareholders.\nAs we discussed on our call last December and during our meeting with Steve Leer, our Chairman, on March 12, our Board has been, and will continue to be, focused on opportunities to enhance shareholder value and would always evaluate any bona fide acquisition proposal for USG. However, our Board and management are highly confident that the strategy we presented publicly at our March 8 Investor Day will deliver substantially more value to our shareholders than your proposal. A few of the critical items of our strategy that the Board considered include:\n• USG has recently transformed its business to a pure manufacturing company with an enhanced portfolio, including innovative new products that are gaining traction in the market, a focused division structure and refreshed operating model;\n• Our focus on substantial margin expansion opportunities with a supportive macroeconomic backdrop;\n• An improving cost position by way of highly accretive investments in advanced manufacturing and other ongoing cost reduction and price optimization initiatives drives our ability to meaningfully expand our free cash flow generation;\n• Many other public and non-public elements of our strategic plan – all of which position us to deliver profitable growth and drive long-term shareholder value.\nIn your proposals, as well as in our conversations and recent meetings, you have emphasized your proposal prices in terms of a stated premium to certain current or recent trading prices for our stock. While the Board has looked at a comprehensive set of data to analyze your proposals, it is important for you to understand that, in determining whether a proposal is in the best interests of all shareholders, the Board has been highly focused on the intrinsic value of our long-term strategic plan and measuring that against the proposal price.\nI suggest we speak to make sure our views are clear. Please let me know when you are available. I look forward to speaking with you soon.\nBest regards,\nJennifer F. Scanlon\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nAbout USG Corporation\nUSG Corporation is an industry-leading manufacturer of building products and innovative solutions.
