Normalised diluted headline EPS, the primary measure of profit in South Africa that strips out one-off items, came in at 1,837.7 cents in the year ended December compared with 1,769.4 a year earlier. Credit impairments fell 20 percent to 7.0 billion rand, Barclays Africa said. (Reporting by Tiisetso Motsoeneng in Johannesburg and Esha Vaish in Bengaluru Editing by Shri Navaratnam)",
