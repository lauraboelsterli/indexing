    "text": "LONG BEACH, New York, March 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Ipsidy Inc. ( www.ipsidy.com ) (OTCQB: IDTY), (formerly known as ID Global Solutions Corporation), a provider of secure, biometric identification, identity management and electronic transaction processing services, today announced its results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Highlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $2.3 million compared to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $17.5 million compared to a net loss of $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. In 2017, there was a negative impact of $4.1 million from the elimination of debt and modification of warrants, as compared to a positive impact of $7.3 million in 2016 from the reduction in the derivative liability. Basic and fully diluted net loss per share for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were both $0.05 cents. Adjusted EBITDA loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $5.7 million compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as the Company invested in infrastructure and technology and engaged additional personnel to support on-going and future operations. Converted outstanding debt and accrued interest in the amount of approximately $6.3 million into approximately 84.8 million shares of common stock. Repaid an additional $0.3 million of outstanding debt, cancelled 3.6 million warrants and cancelled 2.5 million shares of the Company's common stock. Secured $9.0 million of additional equity and $3.0 million of debt financing. Total liabilities reduced to $4.1 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to liabilities of $25.8 million as of December 31, 2016, and stockholders' equity increased to $12.9 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to a stockholders' deficit of $13.3 million as of December 31, 2016.\nThe combination of the above events resulted in the substantial improvement in the Company's balance sheet and provided near-term working capital.\nRefer to Table 1 for reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure).\nOperational Highlights\nAnnounced the appointment of Philip Beck as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive and President and Stuart Stoller as Chief Financial Officer on January 31, 2017. Added Ted Stern to the Board of Directors on September 28, 2017. Changed name to Ipsidy Inc. adopted the new ticker symbol \"IDTY\" and in February 2018 Ipsidy was upgraded to the OTC Markets OTCQB tier. This is a Venture Market for early stage and developing companies who are current in their filings and undergo an annual verification and management certification process. Continued process improvements to the Company's MultiPay bill pay transaction platform in Colombia. Continued to enhance our identity transaction platform. Initiated pilot programs in the United States using IdLok to provide identity and transaction authentication, in order to test our products in the market, gain customer and use feedback and ready the products for commercial launch in the marketplace. In December 2017, we won an international tender by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission for the provision of our IdSearch TM / IMS Voter Registry Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) to provide automated voter roll publication and ensure that no duplicate entries exist in the voter roll for the forthcoming election.\n\"2017 was a year of transformational change,\" said Philip Beck, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ipsidy. \"The Company was recapitalized, management was reorganized and the Ipsidy team strengthened. We continue to enhance our identity transaction platform, in order to create trusted transactions to approve everyday events. Our platform enables customers to choose the levels of friction and assurance that are appropriate to their business. We are looking forward to an exciting year of progress.\"\nWe are building upon our existing capabilities in biometric identification and multi-factor identity authentication and management solutions to develop an identity transaction platform for our business customers. The platform is being designed to enable the end users of our business customers to more easily authenticate their identity through a mobile phone or portable device of their choosing (as opposed to dedicated hardware). Our system enables participants to complete transactions with a digitally signed authentication response, including the underlying transaction data and embedded attributes of the participant's identity.\nWe believe that it is essential that businesses and consumers know who is on the other side of an electronic transaction and have an audit trail, proving that the identity of the other party was duly authenticated. We are continuing to enhance solutions to provide our customers with the next level of transaction security, control and certainty. Our platform uses biometric and multi-factor identity management solutions, which are intended to support a wide variety of electronic transactions. We define \"electronic transactions\" in the broadest sense to include not only financial transactions (i.e. exchanges of value in all of their forms), and legal transactions (e.g. approving the release of personal or other confidential data or the execution of documents), but also access control to physical environments (e.g. border crossings and secure areas at offices, data centers and other sensitive locations) and digital environments (e.g. accessing account information, voting systems, email systems and controlling data network log-ins).\nAdditional analysis of the Company's performance can be found in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" included in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed at www.sec.gov and posted on the Company's investor relations website.\nAbout Ipsidy:\nIpsidy Inc (OTCQB: IDTY) www.ipsidy.com (formerly known as ID Global Solutions Corporation OTC: IDGS) is a provider of secure, biometric identification, identity management and electronic transaction processing services.

Such forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions regarding Ipsidy present and future business strategies, and the environment in which Ipsidy expects to operate in the future, which assumptions may or may not be fulfilled in practice. Implementation of some or all of the new services referred to is subject to regulatory or other third party approvals. Actual results may vary materially from the results anticipated by these forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of risk factors, including the risk that implementation, adoption and offering of the service by customers, consumers and others may take longer than anticipated, or may not occur at all; changes in laws, regulations and practices; changes in domestic and international economic and political conditions and others. Additional risks may arise with respect to commencing operations in new countries and regions, of which Ipsidy is not fully aware at this time.

Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with our results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, provides useful information about our period-over-period results. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because management believes it provides additional information with respect to the performance of our fundamental business activities and is also frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of comparable companies. We also rely on Adjusted EBITDA as a primary measure to review and assess the operating performance of our company and our management team in connection with our executive compensation. These non-GAAP key business indicators, which include Adjusted EBITDA, should not be considered replacements for and should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as GAAP net loss adjusted to exclude: (1) interest expense, (2) interest income, (3) provision for income taxes, (4) depreciation and amortization, (5) stock-based compensation expense (5) derivative income (expense) and (6) certain other items management believes affect the comparability of operating results. Please see \"Adjusted EBITDA\" below for more information and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nIPSIDY INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA\n(Unaudited)\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nNet loss\n$ (17,481,629)\n$ (9,851,403)\nAdd Back:\nInterest expense\n1,337,081\n3,625,984\nIncome taxes\n28,781\n2,946\nConversion of debt, derivative liability, and modifications\n4,106,652\n(7,345,000)\nDepreciation and amortization\n475,211\n421,694\nWrite-off of asset\n212,862\n225,862\nStock compensation\n5,650,072\n8,648,212\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-GAAP)\n$ (5,670,970)\n$ (4,271,705)\nIPSIDY INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Unaudited)\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets:\nCash\n$ 4,413,822\n$ 689,105\nAccounts receivable, net\n165,929\n138,359\nCurrent portion of net investment in direct financing lease\n52,790\n44,990\nInventory, net\n492,030\n150,679\nOther current assets\n218,537\n166,479\nTotal current assets\n5,343,108\n1,189,612\nProperty and equipment, net\n209,719\n115,682\nOther Assets\n1,243,531\n358,343\nIntangible Assets, net\n2,878,080\n3,474,291\nGoodwill\n6,736,043\n6,736,043\nNet investment in direct financing lease, net of current portion\n618,763\n674,015\nTotal assets\n$ 17,029,244\n$ 12,547,986\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (DEFICIT)\nCurrent Liabilities:\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n$ 1,447,185\n$ 1,687,900\nConvertible notes payable, net\n-\n250,000\nDerivative liability\n-\n8,388,355\nCapital lease obligation, current portion\n27,420\n-\nNotes payable, net, current portion\n-\n109,819\nDeferred revenue\n122,511\n398,680\nTotal current liabilities\n1,597,116\n10,834,754\nLong-term liabilities:\nConvertible notes payable, net, less current maturities\n-\n3,051,603\nNotes payable, net, less current maturities\n2,375,720\n2,245,596\nCapital lease obligation, net of current portion\n115,509\n-\nDerivative liability, net of current portion\n-\n9,668,276\nTotal long-term liabilities\n2,491,229\n14,965,475\nTotal liabilities\n4,088,345\n25,800,229\nCommitments and Contingencies\nStockholders' Equity (Deficit):\nCommon stock, $0.0001 par value, 1,000,000,000 and 500,000,000 shares\nauthorized; 403,311,988 and 234,704,655 shares issued\nand outstanding as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively\n40,331\n23,470\nAdditional paid in capital\n79,053,339\n35,341,669\nAccumulated deficit\n(66,407,622)\n(48,925,993)\nAccumulated comprehensive income\n254,851\n308,611\nTotal stockholders' equity (deficit)\n12,940,899\n(13,252,243)\nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity (deficit)\n$ 17,029,244\n$ 12,547,986\nIPSIDY INC AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Unaudited)\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\nRevenues:\nProducts and services\n$ 2,228,910\n$ 1,877,446\nLease income\n74,696\n52,492\nTotal revenues, net\n2,303,606\n1,929,938\nOperating Expenses:\nCost of sales\n589,254\n492,237\nGeneral and administrative\n13,026,188\n14,243,363\nResearch and development\n222,068\n340,317\nDepreciation and amortization\n475,211\n421,494\nTotal operating expenses\n14,312,721\n15,497,411\nLoss from operations\n(12,009,115)\n(13,567,473)\nOther Income (Expense):\n(Loss) gain on derivative liabilities\n(452,146)\n7,345,000\nGain on extinguishment of notes payable\n2,802,234\n-\nLoss on modification of derivatives\n(319,770)\n-\nLoss on modification of warrants\n(158,327)\n-\nLoss on settlement of notes payable\n(5,978,643)\n-\nInterest expense\n(1,337,081)\n(3,625,984)\nOther income (expense), net\n(5,443,733)\n3,719,016\nLoss before income taxes\n(17,452,848)\n(9,848,457)\nIncome tax expense\n28,781\n2,946\nNet loss\n$ (17,481,629)\n$ (9,851,403)\nNet Loss Per Share -
