FILE PHOTO: Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein participates in a panel discussion during the White House Summit on Working Families in Washington June 23, 2014. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst “The sovereigns look risky,” Blankfein said at a luncheon hosted by the Boston College Chief Executives Club.
