    "text": "ANAHEIM, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Willdan Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: WLDN) today announced the appointment of a board member and two officers. Win Westfall is retiring from the Company’s Board of Directors, and the Board has appointed Debra Coy to fill Mr. Westfall’s seat on the Board, effective March 14, 2018. With this change, the current board will remain at nine members, with Tom Brisbin serving as Chairman of the Board.\n“We’d like to thank Win Westfall for over 20 years of service with Willdan,” said Tom Brisbin, CEO of Willdan. “In that time, he’s made many great contributions to our company, serving in roles such as Regional Director, Sr. Vice President of Corporate Relations, President, and Acting CEO. He has been a source of steady guidance as Chairman of the Board from 2006 to 2017 and, more recently, as a Board Member. We are excited to welcome Debra Coy to our Board of Directors. Ms. Coy has extensive experience with public- and investor-owned utilities and public policy. Her background as an equity analyst and her many relationships within the investment community will provide the board with valuable insight as we execute our growth strategy.”\nAdditionally, Paul Whitelaw, Willdan’s Senior Vice President of Business Development, and Micah Chen, Willdan’s General Counsel, have been appointed as corporate officers by the Board of Directors. These appointments take effect on March 14, 2018, when Marc Tipermas and Frank G. Tripepi will step down as officers.\n“We are pleased that Paul Whitelaw and Micah Chen will act as officers on behalf of Willdan,” said Tom Brisbin. “In his 22 years with Willdan, Mr. Whitelaw has demonstrated an ability to grow our company organically. While Mr. Chen has only been with us for a few months, he is well known in the industry and has considerable experience in contract negotiations and dispute resolutions.”\nAbout Willdan’s New Appointments:\nDebra Coy\nCurrently, Debra Coy is a Partner with XPV Water Partners, the largest water-focused growth equity fund in North America, with primary responsibility for managing the firm’s external strategic relationships.
