    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) today filed the company’s 2017 Form 10-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The financial statements contained in the 10-K reflect upward revisions to the company’s full-year 2017 net income as reported on February 13, 2018, with no impact on adjusted earnings.\nThe revision relates to a release of reinsurance reserves for Japanese variable annuities following an internal review of reserving practices for this block of business reported in the MetLife Holdings segment. This reserve release had no impact on payments to customers. The release increased full-year 2017 net income by $264 million and shareholders’ equity by $708 million. Management of the company has determined that the over-reserving represents a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting.\nFor 2018, the reserve release is expected to free up capital and positively impact free cash flow.\nFurther disclosure can be found in the Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section and other portions of MetLife’s 2017 Form 10-K , which is posted on the MetLife Investor Relations website ( investor.metlife.com ).\nAbout MetLife\nMetLife, Inc.

They use words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “will be,” “will not,” and other words and terms of similar meaning, or are tied to future periods, in connection with a discussion of future financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, prospective services or products, future performance or results of current and anticipated services or products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, trends in operations and financial results.\nAny or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong.

Many such factors will be important in determining the actual future results of MetLife, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates. These statements are based on current expectations and the current economic environment. They involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict.

(19) differences between actual claims experience and underwriting and reserving assumptions; (20) ineffectiveness of risk management policies and procedures; (21) catastrophe losses; (22) increasing cost and limited market capacity for statutory life insurance reserve financings; (23) heightened competition, including with respect to pricing, entry of new competitors, consolidation of distributors, the development of new products by new and existing competitors, and for personnel; (24) exposure to losses related to variable annuity guarantee benefits, including from significant and sustained downturns or extreme volatility in equity markets, reduced interest rates, unanticipated policyholder behavior, mortality or longevity, and any adjustment for nonperformance risk;
