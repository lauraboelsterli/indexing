RTR/via Reuters TV “It is still very serious for the two people who were indeed the subject of this outrageous attack,” Rudd said, adding that Britain needed to determine the source of the nerve agent.\n“In terms of further options, that will have to wait until we’re absolutely clear what the consequences could be, and what the actual source of this nerve agent has been,” she said.\nRudd, speaking during a visit to the English city of Salisbury where Skripal and his daughter were found unconscious, also praised the police for their response to the incident.\nReporting by Elizabeth Burden, writing by Alistair Smout and David Milliken, editing by Guy Faulconbridge\n ",
