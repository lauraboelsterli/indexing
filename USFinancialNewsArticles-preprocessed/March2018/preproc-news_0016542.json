    "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - Mercedes and BMW both sold more cars in South Korea than General Motors for the first time last month, helped by the growing popularity of German premium brands and as consumers shied away from GM after it announced a major restructuring.\nFILE PHOTO: A truck driver checks his truck before transporting BMW's Mini cars in Goyang, north of Seoul June 12, 2013. REUTERS/Lee Jae-Won/File Photo While home-grown automakers Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors Corp dominate the local market, high-end German vehicles have made inroads in recent years with more diverse offerings for brand-conscious consumers.\nRelated Coverage GM China vehicle sales in February up 7.8 percent year-on-year BMW saw the biggest jump with February sales nearly doubling to 6,118 vehicles, industry data showed. That was just a tad behind Mercedes which led the imported car rankings with 6,192 cars, up 12 percent from the same period a year earlier.\nSouth Korea last year became the sixth biggest market for Mercedes, climbing from eighth place.\nGM’s announcement last month that it plans to shut down of one of its four factories in South Korea and was weighing the fate of the three other plants resulted in domestic retail sales nearly halving in February to 5,804.\nFILE PHOTO: BMW cars are displayed for sale at a BMW dealership in Goyang, north of Seoul June 12, 2013. REUTERS/Lee Jae-Won/File Photo With consumers worried about loss of after-care services and residual value, GM lost its long-held spot as South Korea’s No. 3 automaker, slipping to sixth place.\nThe U.S automaker, whose South Korean operations are primarily geared toward exports, is seeking financial aid from Seoul as well as concessions on wages and benefits from its local union to stay operating in the country.\nFILE PHOTO: The main gate to GM Korea's Gunsan factory is seen in Gunsan, South Korea February 13, 2018. Yonhap via REUTERS/File Photo Talks with the labor union on Wednesday failed to produce concrete results although some 2,500 workers have applied for voluntary redundancy package.\n“We hope to wrap up talks with the labor union and the government swiftly,” a GM Korea spokesman said.\n“A drawn-out restructuring will hurt consumer trust,” he added.\nReporting by Hyunjoo Jin; Additional reporting by Haejin Choi; Editing by Edwina Gibbs\n ",
