    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - British teenager Billy Monger drew plaudits from Formula One and across the world of motorsport on Saturday after finishing third on his F3 debut less than a year after his legs were amputated.\nThe 18-year-old walked on to the podium on prosthetic legs after competing in a specially adapted car at the opening race of the British Formula Three championship at Oulton Park circuit.\nFour-times world champion Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes team joined Formula One drivers and others on Twitter in congratulating the youngster for his remarkable comeback achievement.\nMonger lost his legs after a Formula Four crash at Donington Park last April, with more than $1 million raised to help his recovery through a crowdfunding campaign.\nThe accident, with the teenager smashing into the back of a stationary car, led to Formula One’s governing body ordering a change to the rear jack points of cars for safety reasons.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Ed Osmond\n ",
