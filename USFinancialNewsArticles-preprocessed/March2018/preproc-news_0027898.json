However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with additional useful information in evaluating our performance. Management believes that excluding certain items that may vary substantially in frequency and magnitude period-to-period from net income and earnings per share (“EPS”) provides useful supplemental measures that assist in evaluating our ability to generate earnings and to more readily compare these metrics between past and future periods. Management also believes that adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluations of companies, and that such supplemental measure facilitates comparisons between companies. We believe free cash flow is an important metric because it represents a measure of how much cash from operations we have available for discretionary and non-discretionary items after the deduction of capital expenditures. These non-GAAP financial measures may be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. For instance, we do not exclude stock-based compensation expense from adjusted EBITDA or non-GAAP net income. Stock-based compensation is an important part of how we attract and retain our employees, and we consider it to be a real cost of running the business.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as substitutes for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are several limitations related to the use of our non-GAAP financial measures as compared to the closest comparable GAAP measures. Some of these limitations include:\nour non-GAAP net income, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS – diluted measures exclude compensation expense that we recognized related to certain stock sales by current and former employees; our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS – diluted measures exclude the impact of the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets following the adoption of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”); our non-GAAP net income, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS – diluted measures exclude the remeasurement of the preferred stock warrant liability, which is a non-cash expense incurred in the periods prior to the completion of our initial public offering; adjusted EBITDA also excludes the recurring, non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future; adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our tax provision, which reduces cash available to us; and free cash flow does not represent the total residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes and does not reflect our future contractual commitments.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net income excluding other (income), net, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, the remeasurement of preferred stock warrant liability and, when present, compensation expense related to certain stock sales by current and former employees. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods presented (in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended January 27,\n2018 January 28,\n2017 January 27,\n2018 January 28,\n2017 Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation: Net income $ 3,641 $ 233 $ 17,129 $ 13,476 Add (deduct): Other income, net (18 ) (6 ) (35 ) (13 ) Provision for income taxes 13,603 (486 ) 18,747 11,303 Depreciation and amortization 2,618 1,924 4,888 3,385 Remeasurement of preferred stock warrant liability (1,614 ) 1,146 (10,685 ) 2,649 Compensation expense related to certain stock sales by current and former employees — 21,283 — 21,283 Adjusted EBITDA $ 18,230 $ 24,094 $ 30,044 $ 52,083 Non-GAAP Net Income\nWe define non-GAAP net income as net income excluding the remeasurement of preferred stock warrant liability and, when present, compensation expense related to certain stock sales by current and former employees, and their related tax impacts, if any, as well as the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets in relation to the adoption of the Tax Act. The following table presents a reconciliation of net income, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to non-GAAP net income for each of the periods presented (in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended January 27,\n2018 January 28,\n2017 January 27,\n2018 January 28,\n2017 Non-GAAP net income (loss) reconciliation: Net income $ 3,641 $ 233 $ 17,129 $ 13,476 Add (deduct): Remeasurement of preferred stock warrant liability (1,614 ) 1,146 (10,685 ) 2,649 Compensation expense related to certain stock sales by current and former employees — 21,283 — 21,283 Tax impact of non-GAAP adjustments — (8,890 ) — (8,890 ) Impact of Tax Act (1) 4,730 - 4,730 — Non-GAAP net income $ 6,757 $ 13,772 $ 11,174 $ 28,518 1) As discussed in Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended January 27, 2018, to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 13, 2018 (“Form 10-Q”), the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation in December 2017. This resulted in a provisional net charge of $4.7 million for the three and six months ended January 27, 2018, due to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets for the reduction in tax rate from 35% to 21%. The adjustment to non-GAAP net income related to the Tax Act only includes this transitional impact. It does not include the ongoing impacts of the lower U.S. statutory rate on current year earnings. Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share - Diluted\nWe define non-GAAP EPS as diluted EPS excluding the per share impact of the remeasurement of preferred stock warrant liability and, when present, compensation expense related to certain stock sales by current and former employees, and their related tax impacts, if any, as well as the per share impact of the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets in relation to the adoption of the Tax Act. The following table presents a reconciliation of EPS attributable to common stockholders - diluted, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to non-GAAP EPS attributable to common stockholders - diluted for each of the periods presented (in thousands):\nFor the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended January 27,\n2018 January 28,\n2017 January 27,\n2018 January 28,\n2017 Non-GAAP earnings per share - diluted reconciliation: Earnings per share attributable to common stockholders - diluted $ 0.02 $ — $ 0.06 $ 0.14 Per share impact of the remeasurement of preferred stock warrant\nliability (1) $ — $ 0.04 $ — $ 0.08 Per share impact of compensation expense related to certain stock\nsales by current and former employees $ — $ 0.66 $ — $ 0.61 Per share impact from tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments $ — $ (0.28 ) $ — $ (0.26 ) Per share impact from Tax Act (2) $ 0.05 $ — $ 0.08 $ — Non-GAAP earnings per share attributable to common stockholders - diluted $ 0.07 $ 0.42 $ 0.14 $ 0.57 1) For the three and six months ended January 27, 2018, the preferred stock warrant liability was dilutive and included in earnings per share attributable to common stockholders - diluted. Therefore, it is not an adjustment to arrive at non-GAAP EPS - diluted. 2) As discussed in Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in our Form 10-Q, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation in December 2017. This resulted in a provisional net charge of $4.7 million for the three and six months ended January 27, 2018, due to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets for the reduction in tax rate from 35% to 21%. The adjustment to non-GAAP earnings per share attributable to common stockholders - diluted related to the Tax Act only includes this transitional impact. It does not include the ongoing impacts of the lower U.S. statutory rate on current year earnings. Free Cash Flow\nWe define free cash flow as cash flow from operations reduced by purchases of property and equipment which is included in cash flow from investing activities. The following table presents a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow for each of the periods presented (in thousands):\nFor the Six Months Ended January 27, 2018 January 28, 2017 Free cash flow reconciliation: Cash flows from operating activities $ 33,735 $ 49,532 Deduct: Purchase of property and equipment (8,232 ) (11,367 ) Free cash flow $ 25,503 $ 38,165 Cash flows from investing activities $ (8,232 ) $ (11,367 ) Cash flows from financing activities $ 130,013 $ (2,635 ) IR Contact:\nDavid Pearce\nir@stitchfix.com\nPR Contact:\nSuzy Sammons\nmedia@stitchfix.com\nSource:Stitch Fix, Inc.",
