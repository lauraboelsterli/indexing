    "text": "Jonathan Toews scored the tiebreaking goal with 1:58 to go in the third period, and the Chicago Blackhawks rallied for a 5-3 win over the Los Angeles Kings on Saturday afternoon at Staples Center in Los Angeles.\nJordan Oesterle, Artem Anisimov, Vinnie Hinostroza and Patrick Kane also scored for the Blackhawks, who erased a two-goal deficit in the third period. Anisimov, Hinostroza, Toews and Kane all scored in the final 10 minutes to spark the comeback.\nChicago ended a two-game losing streak and won for only the fourth time in its past 15 contests. The Blackhawks marked their fourth win when trailing after two periods (4-21-2).\nTanner Pearson, Alec Martinez and Alex Iafallo scored for the Kings. Los Angeles boasted a 20-1-1 record when leading after two periods until Saturday’s third-period collapse.\nBlackhawks goaltender Anton Forsberg made 29 saves to improve to 8-13-3. Kings goaltender Jonathan Quick turned aside 20 shots in the loss.\nToews scored the go-ahead goal on the power play with 1:58 remaining. He snapped a wrist shot from the top of the right circle as Anisimov screened Quick in front of the net.\nChicago opened the scoring 13:11 into the first period. Oesterle collected a loose puck in the high slot and weaved a shot through heavy traffic in front of the net for his fourth goal.\nLos Angeles evened the score 1-1 at the 4:27 mark of the second period. Pearson stole a pass from Blackhawks defenseman Duncan Keith and scored on a partial breakaway.\nThe Kings grabbed a 2-1 advantage less than two minutes later. Martinez drove to the front of the net and scored on a rebound.\nLate in the third period, the Kings made it 3-1 on a goal by Iafallo. He ripped a wrist shot over Forsberg’s left shoulder.\nChicago cut the deficit to 3-2 on a power-play goal by Anisimov with 9:12 to play in the third period.\nHinostroza evened the score 3-3 with 5:36 remaining in the third period. His shot from the slot squeezed through Quick’s pads and trickled across the goal line.\nAfter Toews’ goal, Kane added an empty-net goal with 2.9 seconds remaining.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
