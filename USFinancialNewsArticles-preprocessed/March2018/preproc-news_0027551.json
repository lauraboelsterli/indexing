    "text": " 44 a.m. ET Share \nBritish authorities say Russia is culpable for attempted murder of former Russian double agent Reuters Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov speaking at the United Nations headquarters in New York in September 2016. \nBy Thomas Grove Wiktor Szary \nRussia’s foreign minister warned Thursday that Moscow would soon retaliate against London’s decision to expel 23 Russian diplomats, as the confrontation over the poisoning of a former Russian double agent looked ready to spiral into tit-for-tat measures. \nBritish authorities say Russia is culpable for the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal and his daughter with a nerve agent once produced in the Soviet Union in a Salisbury, England shopping center, an accusation the Kremlin has dismissed as “nonsense.” \nSergei Lavrov, the top Russian diplomat, said Moscow’s move to respond to U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May’s announcement of punitive measures the day before would come through official channels before being publicly announced. \n“You can understand that as polite people we will first of all deliver our response to our British colleagues,” Interfax reported him as saying.",
