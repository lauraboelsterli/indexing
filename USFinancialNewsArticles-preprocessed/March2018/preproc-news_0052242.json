An anti-Brexit demonstrator waves EU and Union flags opposite the Houses of Parliament in London, Britain, March 19, 2018. REUTERS/Hannah McKay \n“The timing for the immigration bill has been delayed because the key element of protecting EU citizens in their rights in the UK has now been achieved through the withdrawal agreement which is going to come before parliament later this year,” Rudd told a parliamentary committee. \n“So the urgency that we had before with the white paper, with the immigration bill, has to a certain extent been removed.” Reporting by William James; editing by Alistair Smout",
