These connections provide Scythian with the ability to conduct its clinical studies at world-class facilities by widely recognized medical professionals.\nScythian has initiated its international expansion by launching additional cannabis-related activities across the globe. These significant endeavours complement the Company’s research and development efforts to enhance the many medical applications of cannabis.\nScythian is evaluating several strategic initiatives and pursuing partnerships with local cultivators, pharmaceutical import and distribution entities and universities in North America, South America, the Caribbean and beyond. This comprehensive approach positions Scythian as a potential global frontrunner in the research and development of medical cannabis.\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nScythian Biosciences Corp.\nJonathan Gilbert, CEO\nPhone: (212) 729-9208\nEmail: info@scythianbio.com\nFor media inquiries, please contact:\nDavid Schull or Nic Johnson\nRusso Partners\n(858) 717-2310\ndavid.schull@russopartnersllc.com\nnic.johnson@russopartnersllc.com\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nCautionary Statements\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking information and statements (“forward looking information”) within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws, that are not based on historical fact, including, without limitation, statements containing the words \"believes\", \"anticipates\", \"plans\", \"intends\", \"will\", \"should\", \"expects\", \"continue\", \"estimate\", \"forecasts\" and other similar expressions.
