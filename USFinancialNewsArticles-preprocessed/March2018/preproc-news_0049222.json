Mr. de Garidel succeeds Corvidia’s Michael Davidson, M.D., who will remain on the company’s executive team as Chief Scientific Officer.\n“As we transition from a clinical stage to ultimately a commercial company, it is important to have a leader with deep, specific industry expertise who can bring Corvidia to the next level. We look forward to working with Marc as we build a company that will lead the way in precision cardiovascular medicine,” said Davidson.\nMr. de Garidel was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Ipsen SA (Euronext: IPN; ADR: IPSEY) between 2010 and 2016 where he led the company through a significant transformation and spearheaded growth of operations in the United States. Prior to his experience at Ipsen, Mr. de Garidel spent 15 years with the multinational biopharmaceutical company Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN). Based primarily in Europe, Mr. de Garidel helped Amgen establish and build a significant business in nephrology and oncology, achieving leadership positions for several portfolio products. He began his career with Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) where he worked in the United States, France and Germany.\n“I am delighted to join Corvidia at this exciting stage. Thanks to Michael and his team, Corvidia is pioneering new pathways in the science of genomics. Their thoughtful, targeted approach holds tremendous potential in developing therapies tailored to patients across a range of complex diseases,” said de Garidel. “I look forward to leveraging this great scientific work as we continue to build this company together.”\nMr. de Garidel joins Corvidia as the company is nearing completion of its Phase 2 clinical trial on a therapy targeting a genetically-defined patient population living with chronic kidney disease. Upon assuming the role of Chief Executive Officer of Corvidia, Mr. de Garidel will retire from his position as Vice Chair of the Board of Directors for Vifor Pharmaceuticals AG (Swiss Ex: VIFN: SIX). He will continue as Chair of the Board of Directors for Ipsen SA.\nAbout Corvidia Therapeutics Inc.\nCorvidia Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical stage biotechnology company based in Waltham, Massachusetts pioneering the next generation of cardiovascular and cardio-renal therapies.
