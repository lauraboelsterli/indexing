    "text": "HOUSTON, March 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Select Energy Services, Inc. (NYSE: WTTR) (\"Select\" or \"the Company\"), a leading provider of total water management and chemical solutions to the U.S. unconventional oil and gas industry, today announced results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. As previously announced, Select completed its merger with Rockwater Energy Solutions, Inc. (\"Rockwater\") on November 1, 2017. All reported financial results for Select for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 include two months of contribution from Rockwater.\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $304.2 million, a 98% increase compared to $153.9 million in the third quarter of 2017 and a 251% increase compared to $86.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss for the fourth quarter was $14.9 million as compared to net income of $2.6 million in the third quarter of 2017 and a net loss of $24.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $43.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $32.4 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $6.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Additionally, given the timing of the merger close on November 1, 2017, fourth quarter results do not include Rockwater's operating results for the month of October, including approximately $70.1 million in revenue, $0.7 million in net income and $7.7 million in Adjusted EBITDA. Please refer to the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) to net loss (a GAAP measure) in this release.\nJohn Schmitz, Select's Executive Chairman, stated, \"2017 marked a momentous year for Select as we executed on a number of strategic initiatives while the industry continued to make positive strides in its recovery. The completion of our IPO in the second quarter marked a significant step towards positioning Select as the clear pure-play market leader in the water solutions industry. We are pleased to have closed the transformative merger between Select and Rockwater during the fourth quarter and have made substantial progress in executing on our integration strategy. In addition to the Rockwater merger, we executed on five other strategic acquisitions throughout the year as we focus on expanding and solidifying our leading water solutions footprint across North America. We are excited about the future of the combined company, and as we enter the first quarter of 2018, we believe our prospects for this year remain strong.\"\nHolli Ladhani, President and CEO, added, \"Looking back on 2017, it is gratifying to see what Select has been able to accomplish in such a short period of time. The fourth quarter continued to provide an active industry environment, although it did present the expected seasonal fluctuations and other challenges towards the end of the year. While we saw modest sequential consolidated revenue growth on a combined-company basis in the fourth quarter, our margins were impacted by a combination of seasonality, revenue mix and merger-related expenses. We expect all of those factors to moderate in 2018 and we are extremely focused on delivering improved margins.\n\"Looking to 2018, I am confident that a resilient oil price environment, coupled with a robust economic outlook, can lead to improved performance as we continue to lead the water solutions and chemicals industries. We have built a business model that we believe will allow us to generate meaningful free cash flow and we are exploring several opportunities to re-invest portions of that cash flow at attractive returns. Over the past several years, we have assembled a strong management team with the skills and experience to manage our operations and the merger-integration process, and we believe the opportunities in front of us are tremendous,\" concluded Ladhani.\nConference Call\nSelect has scheduled a conference call on Thursday, March 8, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. eastern time.

We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial performance and results of operations. Net income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has important limitations as an analytical tool due to exclusion of some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. You should not consider EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as substitutes for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to our net income or net loss, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure for the periods presented:\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nRockwater\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nOne Month Ended\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nOctober 31, 2017 (1)\n(unaudited)\n(in thousands)\nNet (loss) income\n$\n(14,950)\n$\n(24,713)\n$\n(35,127)\n$\n(313,948)\n$\n701\nInterest expense\n4,744\n4,336\n6,629\n16,128\n468\nTax (benefit) expense\n(525)\n(916)\n(851)\n(524)\n121\nDepreciation and amortization\n34,993\n21,589\n103,449\n97,107\n4,806\nEBITDA\n24,262\n296\n74,100\n(201,237)\n6,096\nImpairment\n—\n—\n—\n198,692\n—\nLease abandonment costs\n701\n6,254\n3,572\n19,423\n50\nNon-recurring severance expenses (2)\n4,039\n197\n4,161\n886\n125\nNon-recurring transaction costs (3)\n4,717\n—\n10,179\n(236)\n627\nNon-cash compensation expenses\n5,910\n1\n7,691\n(487)\n387\nNon-cash loss (gain) on sale of subsidiaries and other assets\n965\n(68)\n1,740\n(97)\n(3)\nNon-recurring phantom equity and IPO-related compensation\n—\n—\n12,537\n—\n—\nForeign currency (gain) loss\n(281)\n—\n(281)\n—\n404\nOther non-recurring charges (4)\n3,563\n—\n3,563\n—\n21\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n43,876\n$\n6,680\n$\n117,262\n$\n16,944\n$\n7,707\n(1)\nThe selected stand-alone Rockwater results for the month of October 31, 2017 are presented to provide an understanding of the combined company's fourth quarter 2017 results. This information is voluntarily provided to reflect the pre-merger historical information of Rockwater and reflects the accounting policies of Rockwater prior to the merger. Additionally, the information provided does not reflect any impacts related to the merger and does not reflect what the results are expected to be following the merger. Accordingly, it is only shown for supplemental purposes.\n(2)\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, these costs are associated with severance incurred in connection with the Rockwater merger. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, these costs are associated with the reduction in headcount as a result of the industry downturn.\n(3)\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, these costs are primarily associated with the Rockwater merger and GRR acquisition. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, these costs are associated with our evaluation and negotiation of various transactions that never materialized.\n(4)\nRepresents estimated sales tax liability related primarily to calendar years 2012-2015, offset by gain realized on the Company's previously held interest in Rockwater stock.\nContacts:\nSelect Energy Services\nGary Gillette - CFO & SVP\nChris George - Sr. Director, Finance & Investor Relations\n(713) 296-1073\nIR@selectenergyservices.com\nDennard Lascar Investor Relations\nKen Dennard / Lisa Elliott\n713-529-6600\nWTTR@dennardlascar.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/select-energy-services-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300610280.html\nSOURCE Select Energy Services, Inc.",
