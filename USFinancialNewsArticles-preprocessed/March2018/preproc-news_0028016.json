    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- American International Group, Inc. (NYSE: AIG) today announced that in accordance with the terms of the outstanding warrants (CUSIP number 026874156) (the “Warrants”) to purchase shares of AIG Common Stock, par value $2.50 per share, the Warrant exercise price will be reduced to $43.8498 per share from $44.0005 per share and the number of shares of AIG Common Stock receivable upon Warrant exercise will increase to 1.027 from 1.023. Each of these adjustments will be effective at the close of business on March 15, 2018. Any Warrant exercised on or prior to March 15, 2018 will not be entitled to these adjustments.\nThese adjustments resulted from the declaration by the Board of Directors of AIG on February 8, 2018 of a dividend of $0.32 per share on AIG Common Stock. The dividend is payable on March 29, 2018, to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2018.\nFurther information on the Warrants and the adjustments to the Warrant exercise price and number of shares of AIG Common Stock receivable upon Warrant exercise, including the U.S. Federal income tax treatment of these adjustments, will be available in the Investor Relations section of AIG’s website.\nAmerican International Group, Inc.
