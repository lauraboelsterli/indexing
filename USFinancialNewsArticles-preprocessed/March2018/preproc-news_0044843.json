We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, impairment loss on goodwill and other intangibles, stock-based compensation, and provision for bad debts. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe this supplemental measure of operating performance is helpful in comparing our operating results across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding non-cash items that may, or could, have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on our results of operations in any particular period. We also use Adjusted EBITDA as a factor in evaluating the performance of certain management personnel when determining incentive compensation.\nAdjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, while providing useful information, should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income or cash flows as determined under GAAP. Consistent with Regulation G under the U.S. federal securities laws, Adjusted EBITDA has been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure, and this reconciliation is located under the heading “Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation” following the Consolidated Statements of Operations included in this press release.\nAbout TSS, Inc.\nTSS is a trusted single source provider of mission-critical planning, design, system integration, deployment, maintenance and evolution of data centers facilities and information infrastructure.

In this context, forward-looking statements may address matters such as our expected future business and financial performance, and often contain words such as “guidance,” “prospects,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “should,” or “will.” Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. Particular uncertainties that could adversely or positively affect the Company's future results include: our independent registered public accounting firm’s reports on our 2016 and 2017 financial statements contain an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern; we may not have sufficient resources to fund our business and may need to issue debt or equity to obtain additional funding; our reliance on a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers; risks relating to operating in a highly competitive industry; risks relating to the failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting; risks relating to rapid technological, structural, and competitive changes affecting the industries we serve; risks involved in properly managing complex projects; risks relating to the possible cancellation of customer contracts on short notice; risks relating our ability to continue to implement our strategy, including having sufficient financial resources to carry out that strategy; risks relating to our ability to meet all of the terms and conditions of our debt obligations; uncertainty related to current economic conditions and the related impact on demand for our services; and other risks and uncertainties disclosed in our filings with the Commission, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. These uncertainties may cause our actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements.\nCompany Contact:\nTSS, Inc.\nJohn Penver, CFO\nPhone: (512) 310-1000\nTSS, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands except par values)\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 Assets Current Assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,268 $ 2,152 Contract and other receivables, net 990 2,389 Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 223 539 Inventories, net 134 59 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 114 252 Total current assets 3,729 5,391 Property and equipment, net 418 544 Goodwill 1,907 1,907 Intangible assets, net 561 704 Other assets 112 30 Total assets $ 6,727 $ 8,576 Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity Current Liabilities Convertible notes payable, current portion, net $ - $ 246 Borrowings under factoring agreement - 737 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 2,841 5,319 Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts 2,494 2,818 Total current liabilities 5,335 9,120 Convertible notes, less current portion, net 1,656 825 Other liabilities 41 62 Total liabilities 7,032 10,007 Stockholders’ Equity Preferred stock- $.0001 par value; 1,000 shares authorized at December 31, 2017 and 2016; none issued - - Common stock- $.0001 par value, 49,000 shares authorized at December 31, 2017 and 2016: 16,316 and 16,370 shares issued at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively\n2 2 Additional paid-in capital 68,886 68,522 Treasury stock 769 and 7748 shares at cost at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
