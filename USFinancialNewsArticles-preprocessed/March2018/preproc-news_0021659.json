(\"AMG\", EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: \"AMG\") reported fourth quarter 2017 revenue of $280.7 million, an 18% increase from $237.9 million in the fourth quarter 2016. EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2017 was $33.0 million, a 10% increase from $30.0 million in the fourth quarter 2016. On a full year basis, EBITDA increased by 25% to $125.5 million, from $100.7 million in the prior year.\nNet income attributable to shareholders increased to $14.3 million in the fourth quarter 2017 from $10.0 million in the fourth quarter 2016, and EPS, on a fully diluted basis, increased by 41% to $0.45 in the fourth quarter 2017 from $0.32 in the fourth quarter 2016. On a full year basis, net income attributable to shareholders increased by 40% to $57.0 million in 2017 from $40.6 million in 2016, and EPS, on a fully diluted basis, increased by 36% to $1.80 in 2017 from $1.32 in 2016.\nDr. Heinz Schimmelbusch, Chairman of the Management Board and CEO, said, \"Very strong financial results in the fourth quarter 2017 resulted in the highest annual net income and earnings per share in the Company's history. Furthermore, an exceptionally strong order intake in AMG Engineering of $91.0 million in the fourth quarter resulted in the highest level of order backlog in over 8 years.\nAMG Critical Materials generated EBITDA of $26.9 million during the fourth quarter 2017, an increase of 22% from $22.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, due to a combination of higher vanadium prices, improved product mix and strong sales volumes.\nAMG Engineering signed $91.0 million in new orders during the fourth quarter of 2017, representing a 1.36x book to bill ratio, due to strong orders of turbine blade coating and nuclear waste treatment furnaces. Order backlog was $207.0 million as of December 31, 2017, a 53% increase from $135.5 million as of December 31, 2016. AMG Engineering achieved EBITDA of $6.1 million during the fourth quarter 2017, a decrease of $1.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, due primarily to higher SG&A costs in the quarter.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, AMG generated cash from operating activities of $33.3 million, an increase of $17.7 million, or 114%, over the same period in 2016. On a full year basis, AMG generated cash from operating activities of $78.5 million in 2017, an increase of $22.3 million, or 40%, compared to the same period in 2016.\nAs regards to guidance, in our annual general meeting in May 2017, we introduced our new 'Strategic Framework', and our long-term goal to increase EBITDA to $200 million or more, in 5 years or less, through the execution of a combination of well-developed, highly accretive growth projects, including AMG's entrance into the lithium market.\nThis statement of long term strategy has to be amended in light of what we achieved and learned in 2017, and to date in 2018. We now believe we can achieve our goals earlier than previously expected and can commit to turning the present EBITDA level into $200 million, or more, in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020.\"\nKey Figures\nIn 000's US Dollar Q4 '17 Q4 '16 Change FY '17 FY '16 Change Revenue $280,699 $237,874 18% $1,059,651 $971,148 9% Gross profit 56,507 42,985 31% 214,627 186,808 15% Gross margin 20.1% 18.1% 20.3% 19.2% Operating profit 18,391 11,858 55% 79,752 59,868 33% Operating margin 6.6% 5.0% 7.5% 6.2% Net income attributable to shareholders 14,331 9,956 44% 56,965 40,558 40% EPS - Fully diluted 0.45 0.32 41% 1.80 1.32 36% EBIT (1) 24,629 22,180 11% 94,598 70,811 34% EBITDA (2) 33,027 30,011 10% 125,497 100,652 25% EBITDA margin 11.8% 12.6% 11.8% 10.4% Cash from operating activities 33,272 15,553 114% 78,525 56,225 40% Notes:\nEBIT is defined as earnings before interest and income taxes.

Strong financial performances in vanadium, aluminum, titanium alloys and silicon metal in the quarter were partially offset by lower gross profit in tantalum. The reduction in tantalum gross profit was driven by lower prices during the fourth quarter 2017, compared to the same period in the prior year.\nSG&A expenses in the fourth quarter 2017 increased by $3.1 million, or 16%, compared to the same period in the prior year, due to higher personnel costs and professional fees.\nEBITDA increased by $4.8 million, or 22%, to $26.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to higher levels of gross profit, partially offset by an increase in SG&A expenses.\nAMG Engineering\nQ4 '17 Q4 '16 Change FY '17 FY '16 Change Revenue $66,736 $71,904 (7%) $245,205 $269,514 (9%) Gross profit 17,182 13,357 29% 64,756 56,817 14% Gross profit before non-\nrecurring items 17,514 16,625 5% 65,509 60,473 8% Operating profit 4,041 2,096 93% 17,144 15,506 11% EBITDA 6,120 7,890 (22%) 25,530 27,034 (6%) AMG Engineering signed $91.0 million in new orders during the fourth quarter of 2017, representing a 1.36x book to bill ratio, due to strong orders of turbine blade coating and nuclear waste treatment furnaces. Order backlog was $207.0 million as of December 31, 2017, a 53% increase from $135.5 million as of December 31, 2016. On a full year basis, AMG Engineering signed $290.4 million in new orders, representing a 1.18x book to bill ratio.\nAMG Engineering's fourth quarter 2017 revenue decreased by $5.2 million, or 7%, to $66.7 million, due to lower sales of remelting, vacuum induction and heat treatment furnaces, partially offset by higher sales of turbine blade coating furnaces.\nFourth quarter 2017 gross profit before non-recurring items increased by $0.9 million, or 5%, to $17.5 million, and gross margin before non-recurring items improved to 26% from 23% in the fourth quarter of 2016, due to product mix effects.\nSG&A expenses increased by $1.9 million in the fourth quarter 2017 due to higher employee related expenses and research & development costs.\nEBITDA decreased by $1.8 million to $6.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, due to higher SG&A expenses, partially offset by higher levels of gross profit before non-recurring items.\nOn a full year basis, EBITDA in 2017 reduced by 6% from $27.0 million in 2016 to $25.5 million. However, EBITDA in the prior year benefited from the sale of an unused production facility in Berlin during the third quarter 2016, which contributed $4.3 million in EBITDA. Excluding this benefit in 2016, EBITDA in 2017 increased by 27%, compared to the prior year.\nFinancial Review\nTax\nAMG recorded an income tax expense of $13.9 million in 2017 as compared to $8.1 million in 2016. The increase in income tax expense was driven by higher levels of profitability in 2017, compared to the prior year.\nDue to the volatile nature of the company's deferred tax balances, AMG believes that the cash tax rate is a more meaningful metric. AMG paid taxes of $10.3 million in 2017 as compared to $6.6 million in 2016. For 2017, AMG's effective cash tax rate was 14%, as compared to 13% in 2016.\nNon-Recurring Items\nAMG's fourth quarter 2017 and full year 2017 gross profit include non-recurring items, which are not included in the calculation of EBITDA.\nA summary of non-recurring items in 2017 and 2016 are below:\nNon-recurring items included in gross profit\nQ4 '17 Q4 '16 Change FY '17 FY '16 Change Gross profit $56,507 $42,985 31% $214,627 $186,808 15% Restructuring expense 771 3,466 (78%) 2,547 4,222 (40%) Asset impairment expense 349 1,976 (82%) 1,160 1,976 (41%) Gross profit before non-recurring items 57,627 48,427 19% 218,334 193,006 13% Gross profit before non-recurring items by reporting segment\nQ4 '17 Q4 '16 Change FY '17 FY '16 Change AMG Critical Materials $40,113 $31,802 26% $152,825 $132,533 15% AMG Engineering 17,514 16,625 5% 65,509 60,473 8% Gross profit before non-recurring items 57,627 48,427 19% 218,334 193,006 13% AMG Critical Materials and AMG Engineering gross profit in the fourth quarter 2017 was negatively impacted by restructuring costs related to cost reduction initiatives in Germany. In addition, AMG Critical Materials incurred asset impairment expenses in both the USA and Germany during the quarter.\nEnvironmental expense\nQ4 '17 Q4 '16 Change FY '17 FY '16 Change Environmental 3,092 1,828 69% 3,092 1,873 65% of which non-recurring 3,092 1,277 142% 3,092 1,277 142% During the fourth quarter 2017, AMG recorded a non-recurring environmental expense of $3.1 million related to its Newfield, NJ site, which is not included in the calculation of EBITDA.\nLiquidity\nDecember 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Change Total debt $189,108 $168,080 13% Cash and cash equivalents 178,800 160,744 11% Net debt 10,308 7,336 41% AMG had a net debt position of $10.3 million as of December 31, 2017. Net debt increased by $3.0 million from December 31, 2016, while gross debt increased by $21.0 million.\nCash from operating activities increased to $78.5 million in 2017 from $56.2 million in 2016. In the prior year, the Company made $23.1 million of discretionary pension contributions, which reduced cash from operating activities.\nCapital expenditures increased to $80.9 million in 2017 compared to $44.1 million in 2016. Capital spending in 2017 included $32.0 million of maintenance capital, compared to $18.4 million in 2016. The largest expansion capital projects in 2017 were AMG's lithium project in Brazil and the titanium aluminide expansion in Germany.\nIncluding the $178.8 million of cash, AMG had $329.4 million of total liquidity as of December 31, 2017.\nNet Finance Costs\nAMG's fourth quarter 2017 net finance costs were $2.3 million compared to less than $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to currency gains associated with the Mozambique Metical in the fourth quarter 2016.\nSG&A\nAMG's fourth quarter 2017 SG&A expenses were $35.0 million, an increase of 17% from the same period in the prior year.\nFull year 2017 SG&A expenses were $132.3 million, a 1% increase from $130.8 million in 2016, primarily due to an increase in research & development costs and professional fees.\nFinal Dividend Proposed\nAMG intends to declare a dividend of €0.28 per ordinary share over the financial year 2017. The interim dividend of €0.14, paid on August 15, 2017, will be deducted from the amount to be distributed to shareholders. The proposed final dividend per ordinary share therefore amounts to €0.14.\nA proposal to resolve upon the final dividend distribution will be included on the agenda for the Annual General Meeting to be held on May 2, 2018.\nLithium Project Update\nAMG's lithium project is progressing in-line with expectations, and production is expected to commence mid-2018.\nOn December 12, 2017, AMG announced that the Supervisory Board of AMG had approved the construction of a second lithium concentrate plant at the Mibra mine in Brazil, with an annual production capacity of 90,000 tons.\nAMG expects to complete the planned expansion by the end of 2019, and the total capital investment is approximately $110 million. Once completed, total annual production capacity from AMG's Mibra mine will increase to 180,000 tons of lithium concentrate and 600,000 lbs of tantalum concentrate. As part of the investment, AMG will also expand and develop the existing mining infrastructure to support the expanded lithium and tantalum operations.\nOutlook and Strategy\nAs regards to guidance, in our annual general meeting in May 2017, we introduced our new 'Strategic Framework', and our long-term goal to increase EBITDA to $200 million or more, in 5 years or less, through the execution of a combination of well-developed, highly accretive growth projects, including AMG's entrance into the lithium market.\nThis statement of long term strategy has to be amended in light of what we achieved and learned in 2017, and to date in 2018. We now believe we can achieve our goals earlier than previously expected and can commit to turning the present EBITDA level into $200 million, or more, in the fiscal year ending December 31, 2020.\n2018 has started very well. For the year, we expect our financial performance to show significant improvement compared to 2017, on route to this long term strategic guidance.\nAMG Advanced Metallurgical Group N.V.
