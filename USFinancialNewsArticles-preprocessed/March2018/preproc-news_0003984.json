    "text": "NEW YORK, WeissLaw LLP is investigating possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law by the Board of Directors of Microsemi Corporation (\"MSCC\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: MSCC) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by Microchip Technology Inc. (\"MCHP\") (NASDAQ: MCHP) in a transaction valued at approximately $8.35 billion. Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, MSCC shareholders will receive $68.78 in cash for each MSCC share they own.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether MSCC's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, at least one analyst set a target price of $72.00, or approximately $3.25 above the per-share offer. Further, according to an analyst, the transaction will improve MCHP's accretion potential, driving it to exceed its guidance. It is also projected that this deal could boost MCHP's earnings by 20%-30%.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether MSCC's Board acted in the best interests of MSCC's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. If you own MSCC shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties. We have recovered over a billion dollars for defrauded clients and obtained important corporate governance relief in many of these cases. If you have information or would like legal advice concerning possible corporate wrongdoing (including insider trading, waste of corporate assets, accounting fraud, or materially misleading information), consumer fraud (including false advertising, defective products, or other deceptive business practices), or anti-trust violations, please email us at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com or fill out the form on our website, http://www.weisslawllp.com/microsemi-corporation/\n releases/weisslaw-llp-microsemi-corporation-merger-may-not-be-in-the-best-interests-of-mscc-shareholders-300608338.html\nSOURCE WeissLaw LLP",
