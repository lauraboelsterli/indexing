    "text": "2 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—House Republicans pushed to leave their mark on a bipartisan overhaul of the banking sector approved this week by the Senate, a move that could slow momentum for the legislation in Congress.\nHouse Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) on Thursday said the House wouldn’t “rubber stamp” the Senate measure, which was approved 67-31 on Wednesday with the support of 17 members of the Democratic caucus. He described the Senate bill as “an important first step.”\nMr. Hensarling, who is retiring from Congress this year, said he discussed the bill with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) and was told the bill wouldn’t leave Mr. Ryan’s desk “unless and until the Senate negotiates with the House,” indicating House lawmakers want to debate adding provisions they favor to the legislation.\nThe remarks reflect disappointment by some House lawmakers that the Senate bill, which relaxes Dodd-Frank requirements for small and medium-size banks, doesn’t incorporate more bipartisan provisions already approved by the House.\nRelated\nThe Fine Print: What’s in the Senate Financial-Regulation Bill FICO’s Lock on Mortgage Credit Scores Comes Under Fire Bill Set to Boost Warren Buffett’s Mobile-Home Business Senate Banking Bill Exposes Democratic Rifts Heard on the Street: The Surprisingly Large Winners in a Bill to Help Small Banks Adding to the Senate plan could upset the deal between Senate Republicans and the group of centrist Democrats who backed it. Senate aides have said making changes to the package could delay final passage of the overhaul for weeks or months, or derail it altogether. Centrist Democrats have already said they won’t support negotiations with House lawmakers to make changes to the Senate bill.\nMr. Hensarling appears to be gambling that centrist Democrats running in states won by President Donald Trump —a group that includes Sens. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Jon Tester of Montana— will accept additional provisions that broaden the scope of the bill because they are eager to point to bipartisan accomplishments in their campaigns. Several measures were added to the bill during Senate debate as part of an effort to smooth passage of the bill in the House.\nDemocrats have already weathered attacks from their more liberal colleagues for supporting the plan and say they are prepared to walk away from a deal if the House adds controversial measures.\n“There are some out there that will say this bill is going to look completely different when it comes back from the House,” Mr. Tester said last week. “If it does, then I guess we’re done.”\nBrian Gardner, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said it “would be the greatest irony if House Republicans wind up killing the bill and doing what Sen. Elizabeth Warren could not.”\nMs. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, led the opposition to the bill in the Senate.\nIn its present form, the Senate bill includes some provisions from a broader House deregulatory package that passed the chamber last year without any Democratic support. Senate Democratic aides say it also incorporates other legislation that advanced through the House in recent years. House Republicans want more and want to convene a formal or informal panel of lawmakers from both chambers to negotiate a broader deal.\n“We incorporated almost 40 House bills, many of which are bipartisan, into the Senate bill,” Ms. Heitkamp said in a statement.\nMr. Hensarling said he has a list of some 30 stand-alone bills advanced on a bipartisan basis in the House or his committee that are candidates for inclusion in the Senate’s regulatory rollback.\nOne measure, passed by the House in a 344-73 vote, would clarify existing regulations governing how startups pitch potential investors on private offerings. Another, approved unanimously by voice vote, would revamp the criteria by which individual investors are deemed eligible to invest in closely held startups.\n“Why in the world is this viewed as the ceiling and not the floor?” asked Rep. Bill Huizenga (R., Mich.), who addressed reporters at the same briefing.\nWrite to Andrew Ackerman at andrew.ackerman@wsj.com",
