    "text": "Stanford forward Reid Travis had 19 points and 13 rebounds and Dorian Pickens had 16 points as the fifth-seeded Cardinal advanced to the quarterfinals of the Pac-12 tournament with a 76-58 victory over the California Golden Bears at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas on Wednesday.\nDaejon Davis and Josh Sharma had 12 points apiece for the Cardinal (18-14), who never trailed while winning for the fifth time in six games and the seventh in 10.\nFreshman Darius McNeill had 19 points, all in the first half, and Juhwan Harris-Dyson had 11 before fouling out for the Bears (8-24), who have lost 17 of 18 since overcoming a 17-point deficit to beat Stanford in the first game of Pac-12 play Dec. 30.\nStanford will meet fourth-seeded UCLA (20-10) in the second quarterfinal Thursday. The teams split in the regular season, each winning at home.\nPlagued by early-season injuries, Stanford likely must win the Pac-12 tournament to be included in the 68-team NCAA Tournament field. The home loss to Cal stains its resume.\nTravis, a two-time All-Pac-12 selection has 13 double-doubles, six in his last eight games. He made 7 of 12 field-goal attempts while playing only 27 minutes.\nCal shot a season-low 28.2 percent, making under 40 percent for the 11th time in its last 12 games. Its previous season-low was 30.2 percent at Utah.\nTravis had eight points and Pickens had a 3-pointer in the first four minutes as Stanford took a 13 4 lead. It was 39-28 at half.\nPickens has made 31 3-pointers in his last nine games.\nMcNeill made 5 of 10 3-point attempts and set a Cal freshman record with 67 this season. Allen Crabbe, now with the Brooklyn Nets, had 62 in 2011.\nStanford had a 51-42 rebounding advantage, including 17 offensive rebounds, and scored 30 points in the paint.\nThe Cardinal finished tied for third place in the Pac-12 regular season at 11-7 and had double-digit conference victories for the third time in 10 seasons.\nâ€”Field Level Media\n ",
