    "text": "LINCOLN, Neb., March 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Continuing its rapid growth, Berry Law Firm added significant legal firepower at the end of 2017 with the addition of Christopher Ferdico. A 23-year Veteran of the Army and a seasoned trial attorney with experience at the most prestigious levels of practice in Nebraska, Mr. Ferdico joined in December 2017 as Lead Trial Attorney. Beyond providing guidance on each of the Firm's existing practice areas, he also immediately added substantial experience to the Firm's firearms law practice, military law, employment law, and administrative law.\nDuring his time in the Army and National Guard, Lieutenant Colonel Ferdico was awarded both the Bronze Star and the Meritorious Service Medal, among other awards. He deployed to both Kosovo and Iraq, serving with the 101 st Airborne Division during the invasion of Iraq. In 2010, he returned to Iraq as the Brigade Judge Advocate, focusing on Operational Law, Intelligence Law, Administrative Law, and Military Justice as he advised senior combat commanders.\nMr. Ferdico was the 4 th new attorney addition to Berry Law Firm in 2017, adding to the vigorous growth that earned Berry Law Firm a place in the Inc. 5000 list for fastest growing businesses in 2017. As the Firm has expanded its levels of service in Omaha, it has also increased representation throughout Southeast Nebraska, including Gretna, Bellevue, Ashland, Aurora, York, and Geneva. The firm now has 6 locations in the U.S. and serves Veterans nationwide.\nMr. Ferdico adds even more areas of practice to Berry Law Firm's already extensive arsenal. He has a breadth of litigation and appellate experience in the areas of personal injury, premises liability, products liability, and administrative law, while also having litigated a wide variety of felony and misdemeanor criminal defenses. He has been appointed as a Special Assistant Attorney General to lead a special investigative task force for the State of Nebraska, and in 2011 was awarded the President's Professionalism Award from the Nebraska State Bar Association.\nAn avid defender of the 2 nd Amendment, Mr. Ferdico is also well regarded in the firearms community. He is a member of the National Rifle Association and is Berry Law Firm's representative to the National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF).\nMr. Ferdico received both his undergraduate and law degrees from Creighton University, and was awarded his Juris Doctor cum laude.\nContact Berry Law Firm at 402-466-8444 or via www.jsberrylaw.com\nMedia Contact:\nWilliam Tuttle\n191143@email4pr.com\n402-466-8444\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/christopher-ferdico-joins-berry-law-firm-300607694.html\nSOURCE Berry Law Firm",
