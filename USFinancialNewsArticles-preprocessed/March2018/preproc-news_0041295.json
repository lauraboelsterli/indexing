    "text": "Del Taco to be first partner to use Punchh for complete customer lifecycle marketing\nSAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Today, Punchh announced a brand new product for their industry-leading Restaurant Marketing Cloud ™ platform, called “Punchh Acquire,” designed to address one of the most critical and difficult marketing needs of any restaurant: new customer acquisition. With the launch of the Punchh Acquire Beta, Punchh becomes the only unified marketing platform for both customer acquisition and customer lifetime value growth. Punchh Acquire empowers restaurants to bring in new customers through leading consumer networks like Apple Pay, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and more. Once new customers visit for the first time, Punchh lets you get to know every customer across hundreds of locations at scale and assign them with digital identities and profiles, allowing restaurants to measure campaign efficacy and make adjustments in real-time to help move that customer up the value chain towards brand loyalty.\n“Our business is all about building relationships with customers because relationships grow revenue, but you simply can’t build a relationship with customers who remain digitally invisible - both those who are visiting for the first time and the ones who have already visited but have not established a relationship with your restaurant,” said Shyam Rao, CEO and co-founder of Punchh. “Once a customer makes a purchase in your restaurant, Punchh is already the single most powerful platform available for retaining and growing the lifetime value of that customer. With the launch of Punchh Acquire, our platform is now the only solution available to restaurants that allows them to turn these ‘invisible customers’ into first time patrons and begin building personal, lasting and profitable relationships.”\nThe new Punchh Acquire product empowers restaurants to market to new customers from the moment they walk through the door through a sophisticated mix of multi-channel marketing tools that integrate with any third-party ESP, SMS, WiFi including:\neClub – enroll members and target them with tailored offers and coupons SMS – opt-in new customers and target them with tailored offers and coupons via SMS WiFi – turn anonymous customers into known customers when they access WiFi, and target them with tailored offers and coupons Apple Pay – target and acquire Apple Pay users into in-store rewards programs Bounce Back Offers – target anonymous guests with tailored offers on receipts when they make purchases, to entice them to visit again and turn them into known customers\nPunchh’s network of restaurant customers includes more than 100 restaurant chains across the globe, representing more than $10B in annual spend by 20 million consumers. Four leading restaurant brands have already deployed the new Punchh Acquire product during its Beta test period, including Del Taco and others.\nPunchh is also working with key partners to deliver all of the different marketing channel components used in Punchh Acquire, including Twilio for SMS, Sendgrid for email, and leading in-restaurant WiFi providers.\nNew or existing Punchh Restaurant Marketing Cloud customers can sign up for the Punchh Acquire Beta today to build a unified, omni-channel marketing solution.
