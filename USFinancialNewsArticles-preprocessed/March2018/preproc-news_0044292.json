    "text": "Terry Rozier scored a career-high 33 points, including a tie-breaking 3-pointer with 8:53 remaining that gave Boston the lead for good, lifting the Celtics to a 104-93 victory over the Sacramento Kings on Sunday afternoon in Sacramento, Calif.\nRozier’s game-high point total included a career-best eight 3-pointers as he singlehandedly outscored the Kings 24-21 from beyond the arc in Boston’s third consecutive win.\nReserve Buddy Hield had three of the Kings’ seven 3-pointers and a team-high 21 points in defeat.\nThe tightly contested game was tied at 82 before Rozier drilled his eighth 3-pointer to ignite a runaway finish. He followed up with a three-point play, helping the Celtics to a 22-11, game-ending run.\nRozier’s previous career-highs for points (31) and 3-pointers (six) both came in the same game against the Atlanta Hawks on Feb. 2.\nHe connected on eight of his 12 3-point attempts and 12 of his 16 shots in all, helping the Celtics shot 55.6 percent for the game.\nRozier also found time for five steals for the Celtics, who reached the 50-win mark for the second consecutive season.\nJaylen Brown added 19 points, Al Horford 14 and Jayson Tatum 12 for Boston, which improved to 2-0 on its four-game Western swing.\nHorford also logged a game-high eight assists.\nSkal Labissiere (14 points), Willie Cauley-Stein (14), Frank Mason III (12) and De’Aaron Fox (11) joined Hield in double figures for the Kings, who have lost two of three to tip off a six-game homestand.\nKosta Koufos collected a game-high nine rebounds to complement eight points for the Kings, whose 50th loss gave them 50 or more in eight of the last 10 seasons.\nThe Kings led by as many as 10 points in the first half and 60-52 at the break before the Celtics used a 28-18 third period to go up 80-78 entering the final 12 minutes.\nRozier hit three of his eight 3-pointers in the third-quarter run.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
