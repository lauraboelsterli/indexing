    "text": "New York, March 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Value Line, Inc., (NASDAQ: VALU ) reported results for the third fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2018.\nDuring the nine months ended, the Company’s net income of $13,283,000, or $1.37 per share, was $4,000,000 or 43.1% above net income of $9,283,000, or $0.96 per share, for the nine months ended January 31, 2017. During the three months ended January 31, 2018, the Company’s net income of $8,996,000, or $0.93 per share, was $7,551,000 above net income of $1,445,000, or $0.15 per share, for the three months ended January 31, 2017 due to the fiscal 2018 reduction in the U.S. statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% on the Company’s long-term deferred tax liabilities, resulting in a tax benefit of 65.87% of pre-tax income for the nine months ended January 31, 2018. The Company re-calculated its net deferred tax assets and liabilities using the federal income tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The effect of the re-calculation is reflected entirely in the third quarter ended January 31, 2018 (the period that includes the enactment date) and is allocated directly to both current and deferred income tax expenses from continuing operations. Income from operations of $2,760,000 during the nine months ended January 31, 2018 was $5,188,000 below income from operations of $7,948,000, which included a pre-tax gain of $8,123,000 from the sale of the Company's operating facility during the nine months ended January 31, 2017 for which it received net proceeds of $11,555,000 on July 29, 2016. The decrease in income from operations during the nine months ended January 31, 2018, was partially offset by a $2,913,000 decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal year 2018.\nShareholders’ equity of $44,518,000 at January 31, 2018 increased $6,664,000 or 17.6% compared to shareholders’ equity of $37,854,000 at April 30, 2017. As of January 31, 2018, retained earnings and liquid assets were $45,288,000 and $22,622,000, respectively. During the nine months ended January 31, 2018 there were 9,705,347 average common shares outstanding as compared to 9,724,377 average common shares outstanding during the nine months ended January 31, 2017.\nThe Company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q has been filed with the SEC and is available on the Company’s website at www.valueline.com/About/corporate_filings.aspx .
