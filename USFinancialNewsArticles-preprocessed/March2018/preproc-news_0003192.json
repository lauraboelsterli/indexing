    "text": "March 2, 2018 / 2:24 PM / Updated 11 minutes ago UK PM May says sectors would need to abide by EU rules to retain position post-Brexit Reuters Staff 1 Min Read LONDON, March 2 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Friday Britain would seek to remain within certain EU regulatory agencies such as those governing chemicals, aviation, and medicine, in order to retain market position. May said British laws did not need to be the same as the EUâ€™s to achieve the same regulatory outcomes but added that if parliament decided not to maintain those standards, it would have to be aware it might have market access consequences.
