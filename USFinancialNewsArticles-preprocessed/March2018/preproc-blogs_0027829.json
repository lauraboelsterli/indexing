    "text": "Ford is recalling nearly 1.4 million midsize cars in North America because the steering wheel can detach from the steering column and drivers could lose control.\nThe recall covers certain Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ cars from the 2014 through 2018 model years.\nFord says steering wheel bolts can loosen over time. The company says it knows of two crashes and one injury allegedly related to the problem.\nDealers will replace the bolts with longer ones that have more aggressive threads and a nylon patch to stop them from coming loose.\nJust over 1.3 million cars in the U.S. are being recalled. The rest are in Canada and Mexico.\nFord is also recalling roughly 6,000 additional cars for a potential clutch pressure plate fracture that could pose a fire risk.\nThe vehicles affected in the second recall are 2013-16 Ford Focus with 1.0-liter Fox GTDI engines and B6 manual transmissions, and well as 2013-15 Ford Fusion with 1.6-liter Sigma GTDI engines and B6 manual transmissions.\nClarification: This story has been updated to clarify that Ford says two crashes and one injury are ALLEGEDLY related to the defect.\n-- CNBC's Robert Ferris contributed to this story.",
