(NYSE American: CTO) (the “Company”) today announced the closing of the sale of approximately 34.87 acres to Buc-ee’s, Ltd. for approximately $13.9 million, or $400,000 per acre (the “BUC-EE’S Land Sale”). The land parcel is on the north side of LPGA Boulevard along the east side of Interstate 95. The estimated initial gain on the BUC-EE’S Land Sale is approximately $12.0 million, or approximately $1.61 per share, after tax. The remaining gain on the BUC-EE’s Land Sale will be recognized when the Company has completed the wetlands mitigation required for the applicable permitting of the site. The Company paid approximately $831,000 into escrow at closing in connection with the estimated mitigation work. The Company intends to utilize the proceeds from the BUC-EE’s Land Sale to fund a portion of the previously acquired income property located near Portland, Oregon leased to Wells Fargo, through a reverse 1031 like-kind exchange structure. Buc-ee’s plans to develop one of their signature large-format convenience stores with at least 120 fueling positions and a retail store in excess of 50,000 square feet.\nAs of March 16, 2018, the Company’s pipeline of potential land sales transactions, including the terms of an executed non-binding term sheet to form a joint venture with an institutional investor to establish a mitigation bank on a parcel of the Company’s land, includes seventeen potential transactions with fifteen different buyers, representing potential proceeds of approximately $136.9 million and approximately 6,000 acres, or approximately 74% of our land holdings.\nAbout Consolidated-Tomoka Land Co.\nConsolidated-Tomoka Land Co. is a Florida-based publicly traded real estate company, which owns a portfolio of income investments in diversified markets in the United States including over 2.1 million square feet of income properties, as well as nearly 8,100 acres of land in the Daytona Beach area.
