He will assemble and manage a framework of well-focused and tightly aligned revenue-related teams, with highly coordinated cross-functionality and scalable operations. Craig brings more than 25 years of experience in sales strategy, channel optimization, operations and global sales management across high-growth technology companies. He comes to UiPath from Nutanix, an IT infrastructure company, where he served as senior vice president of sales and achieved revenue growth that led to a successful IPO. Prior to Nutanix, Craig has had various executive positions at EMC, Utimaco, Sophos and DPC including VP of Sales, COO and CEO.\nVargha Moayed, chief strategy officer\nAs UiPath's Chief Strategy Officer, Vargha Moayed will work closely with UiPath CEO Daniel Dines and the senior leadership to formulate and communicate key strategic initiatives. He will be responsible for ensuring strategic plans are implemented rapidly and that all operational areas are informed, aligned and accountable. Vargha joins from EY, where he was a partner leading advisory services in Romania. Early to recognize the transformational opportunities with RPA, he also built EY’s RPA Center of Excellence for EMEA. He championed the technology with clients across the oil and gas, energy and utilities, financial services and public administration markets. Throughout his professional services career, Vargha has consulted multinational organizations on corporate strategy, sales management and organizational effectiveness. His previous experience includes co-founding a software company and a high-tech incubator with Goldman Sachs as lead investor. He also worked for McKinsey in North America and was a vice president of corporate development for First Data.\n“Craig and Vargha bring considerable experience and expertise in scaling sales organizations and leading transformational initiatives for clients, respectively,” said Daniel Dines, co-founder and CEO for UiPath. “These are important hires for the company as we prepare for the next phase of expansion. They will be instrumental in helping UiPath support massive demand for enterprise RPA and AI on a global stage.”\nLaunched in 2015, UiPath has become the most widely adopted Enterprise RPA platform. Last year, the company grew its enterprise customer base from less than 100 to more than 700, and increased 8x in annual recurring revenue. UiPath continues to expand globally, with recent new operations in Amsterdam, Houston, Munich, Paris, Seoul and Washington D.C. this quarter. The company now employs more than 590 professionals across 14 countries.\nAbout UiPath\nBuilt for both business and IT, UiPath is the leading platform for enterprise Robotic Process Automation (RPA).
