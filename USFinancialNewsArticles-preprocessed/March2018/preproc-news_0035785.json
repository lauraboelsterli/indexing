    "text": "3 COMMENTS Good morning. I’m camping out at Advertising Week Europe in London this week; do say hello if you’re attending, too. Last year’s event was dominated by discussion about YouTube’s brand safety fallout. A certain Facebook story that dominated the headlines over the weekend will no doubt be one of the key topics this year.\nData, Data, High Voltage To that Facebook story, then. The social network attempted to get ahead of the news by putting out a statement Friday saying it had suspended Cambridge Analytica , the data firm used by the Trump 2016 campaign, after finding that it improperly harvested data about its users for years, despite telling the social network it had destroyed those records. The Observer and New York Times dropped their bombshell reports Saturday, providing details about how a U.K.-based academic (who also has been suspended from Facebook) and his company, Global Science Research, used a personality test to not only collect information about participants, but also their Facebook friends—some 50 million profiles overall—mostly without their permission, purportedly under the guise of research. A whistleblower ( suspended by Facebook now, too ) who used to work at Cambridge Analytica said the company used this data to build a powerful political ad-targeting program. Cambridge Analytica has said it didn’t use the data collected by Global Science Research during the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n—Fall Out Boy—\nNow lawmakers in the U.S. and the U.K. are demanding Facebook provide more information about what it knew about the data and when. The issue once again calls into question whether Facebook can prevent its platform from being manipulated by bad actors, although the social network did make a change in 2015 to prevent third parties from accessing information about users’ friends. Despite those changes, Facebook can’t easily ensure data already gleaned about users’ social graph by developers wasn’t shared with third parties, a violation of its policies. For all Madison Avenue’s concerns about Facebook being a “walled garden,” the news shows how it could be scaled, at least at one point in time. The debate around the regulation of internet advertising platforms will surely be raised again, and some users may now be thinking about whether they can trust the platform with their information. Meanwhile, Facebook, which said it’s conducting its own review, is pressing that the data illicitly obtained didn’t technically amount to a “breach,” an argument its executives defensively took to Twitter over the weekend.\nChippin’ Away Questions about Facebook’s ability to police its ad platform had already been mounting in recent months. And there’s some suggestion that controversies including brand-safety concerns, measurement snafus, fake news and the role of tech platforms in Russia’s efforts to spread misinformation in the lead-up to the 2016 U.S. election might be chipping away at Facebook and Google’s advertising dominance. As CMO Today’s Alex Bruell reports, Google and Facebook’s combined share of the U.S. digital ad market will dip for the first time this year , according to estimates from research firm eMarketer. To be sure, Google and Facebook are still far and away the category leaders—with 37.2% and 19.6% share of the market, respectively—but the dip in dominance indicates smaller rivals are grabbing bigger chunks of the expanding digital ad pie. Amazon is now the fifth-largest digital ad player in eMarketer’s rankings, with an estimated 2.7% share of the U.S. digital ad market in 2018, but eMarketer predicts that by 2020, the retail giant will surpass Oath and Microsoft to shift into third place.\nSnap It Up Snap is estimated by eMarketer to increase its share of the U.S. digital ad market to 1% in 2018. Its Facebook-owned, imitation-is-the-best-form-of-flattery rival Instagram, however, is expected to gain more than a 5% market share. And Snap is grappling with user fallout following its redesign last month. But as WSJ’s Georgia Wells reports, there’s often a mismatch between what people say and what they actually do. First-time installs of Snapchat increased about 18% in the first month after the redesign rollout, according to app-research firm Sensor Tower. And, importantly for Snap’s media partners, users also appear to be spending more time perusing the Discover section , according to people close to Snap. That’s a key data point Snapchat might well begin shouting about a little louder in the coming weeks and months as publishers begin to count the costs of Facebook’s recent algorithm changes.\nTime to Face the Music When Meredith announced plans to acquire magazine publisher Time Inc. for $1.85 billion last year, its executive chairman, Stephen Lacy, talked up its ability to reach more than 200 million consumers across all platforms and its ability to become a “top 10 digital media company” in the U.S. Meredith, too, said it would quickly look to cut costs in overlapping areas. Now that the deal has been completed, the company is expected to lay off 200 to 300 staffers as soon as this week as part of plans to trim up to $500 million in costs over the next two years, WSJ’s Jeffrey Trachtenberg reports. The cuts are expected to mostly affect Time Inc.’s corporate employees in New York. People familiar with the matter say Meredith also is expected to unveil a new sales structure that will have a greater focus on specific magazine brands. In recent years, Time Inc.’s sales approach had emphasized specific ad categories, such as pharmaceuticals. But now, with a bigger digital and print footprint, Meredith is preparing a new pitch to advertisers that promotes its scale.\nBest of the rest An investigation by Business Insider found YouTube’s Kids app was suggesting conspiracy videos to children. YouTube said in a statement that “sometimes we miss the mark,” and the company has removed the videos that were brought to its attention. [ Business Insider ]\nCondé Nast is leaving the “Concert” ad sales partnership formed by NBCUniversal and Vox Media in March 2017. [ Digiday ]\nUnivision has hired Boston Consulting Group to review the company’s business as it explores extensive cost cuts, having shelved plans for an initial public offering. BCG has proposed cutting the budget of Fusion Media Group by as much as 35%, people familiar with the matter said. [ CMO Today ]\nJ.Walter Thompson is eliminating its worldwide chief creative officer role. Matt Eastwood, who had been in that role since 2014, is leaving the company to “pursue other interests.” [ Adweek ]\nLinkedIn is getting ready to roll out a group of features designed to get people to use it more often.
