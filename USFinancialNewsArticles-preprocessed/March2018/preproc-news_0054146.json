The brokerage has an “outperform” rating on the stock with a target price of 170 pence.\nAnalysts at Peel Hunt, who raised their 2018 forecasts by 10 percent, said CMC’s latest statement emphasises the strength of its platform. They expect to see a re-rating in CMC shares as the current regulatory overhang dissipates.\nReporting by Noor Zainab Hussain and Rahul B in Bengaluru; Editing by Sunil Nair\n ",
