    "text": "March 30, 2018 / 11:02 PM / Updated 28 minutes ago UPDATE 1-Cricket-England rip top off NZ order after Bairstow scores ton Reuters Staff \n* Broad takes three wickets, Anderson one \n* NZ in desperate trouble at lunch \n* Bairstow brought up century before last man out (Updates at lunch) \nCHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand, March 31 (Reuters) - Stuart Broad and James Anderson followed up Jonny Bairstow’s fifth test century with four quick wickets to put England in charge of the second test against New Zealand as they reduced the hosts to 32 for four at lunch on the second day. \nBairstow was the last man out for England as the visitors reached 307, bringing up his century shortly before Tim Southee and Trent Boult wrapped up the innings some 30 minutes into the day’s play at Hagley Oval. \nThe 28-year-old was quickly back in action as New Zealand began their innings, with Anderson having Tom Latham caught by the wicketkeeper for nought before Jeet Raval fell in similar circumstances to Broad for five. \nRoss Taylor then edged to Alastair Cook for two off Broad, before the tall right armer trapped first test centurion Henry Nicolls in front for a duck. \nNicholls had originally been given not out by umpire Bruce Oxenford, but England captain Joe Root had the decision overturned on review, leaving the hosts in deep trouble at 17 for four. \nNew Zealand captain Kane Williamson, who had survived his own confident lbw appeal and review against Anderson, was on 18 at the break with BJ Watling on seven. Broad has figures of 3-18. \nEngland had resumed play on a credible 290 for eight after Bairstow had rallied the tail to support him on the first day. \nDebutant Jack Leach took the majority of the early strike on Saturday before Bairstow tucked a Boult delivery off his hip for a single to reach his personal milestone, prompting a standing ovation from the small crowd. \nSouthee, who finished with six for 62, added to his seventh five-wicket haul when he had Leach caught behind for 16 in the next over before Bairstow was caught at third man by Taylor off Boult nine balls later for 101. \nEngland need a win to stop New Zealand clinching their first series against them since 1999. The hosts won the first test at Eden Park in Auckland by an innings and 49 runs. (Reporting by Greg Stutchbury in Wellington; Editing by Peter Rutherford)",
