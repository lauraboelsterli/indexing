    "text": "March 28, 2018 / 7:34 PM / Updated an hour ago Higher prices help foie gras farmers overcome bird flu crises Sybille de La Hamaide 3 Min Read \nPARIS (Reuters) - Higher foie gras prices and large public subsidies have allowed farmers to overcome two consecutive bird flu crises that ravaged duck flocks in southwest France, but output will take time to recover, producers said on Wednesday. \nFrance, which has one of the largest poultry flocks in the European Union, had to cull millions of ducks and imposed a full halt in production at farms last year and the previous one due to severe bird flu outbreaks. \nIt has been spared so far this year, and the season during which farms are most at risk of being contaminated by migrating wild birds is soon coming to an end. \nProducers of foie gras, a duck or goose liver pate, have been particularly hit by the virus as their rearing methods - which involve keeping birds outside and then moving them to force-feeding and slaughtering buildings - raise the risk of the virus spreading. \nFoie gras is considered a gourmet food in Western and Asian cuisine, but the practice of force-feeding is condemned as cruel by animal activists. \n“We met the challenge, we were on supermarkets shelves for year-end festivities. Volumes were smaller but with a 20 percent drop in output on the previous year it was to be expected and sales in value were good,” Michel Fruchet, chairman of French foie gras producers group Cifog, told reporters. \nFoie gras sales fell 12.8 percent by volume in supermarkets in 2017, but rose 1 percent by value, Cifog said. Volumes had fallen 9.3 percent and sales value was down 1.9 percent in 2016. \nThe bird flu crises in 2016 and 2017 have forced French foie gras farmers to change production methods at costs the industry has passed in prices to customers. \nInvestments include new equipment such as cleaning tools and extra premises to confine birds when they are most at risk of contracting the virus. \n“In a strained context when we were concerned that the price could deter consumers, it was not the case and we are reassured,” Cifog general secretary Marie-Pierre Pe said. \nFrench duck farmers have received nearly 350 million euros (£306 million) in subsidies to help them cope with the bird flu crisis, with input from France and the European Union. About 3,500 farms benefitted from the support overall, Cifog said. \nThe number of ducks produced in France fell to 23 million in 2017 from 29 million in 2016 and 37 million in 2015, Pe said.
