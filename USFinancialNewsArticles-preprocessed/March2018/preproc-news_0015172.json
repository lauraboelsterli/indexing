    "text": "  11:54 a.m. ET Share \nFirm’s co-presidents, Harvey Schwartz and David Solomon, are leading candidates to replace the 63-year-old CEO Bloomberg News A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. logo on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange \nBy Joann S. Lublin Liz Hoffman \nLloyd Blankfein is preparing to step down as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s chief executive as soon as the end of the year, capping a more than 12-year run that would make him one of the longest-serving bosses on Wall Street. \nGoldman GS, +1.28% is likely to follow an announcement of Mr. Blankfein’s departure with a quick transfer of power and isn’t looking beyond Goldman’s two co-presidents, Harvey Schwartz and David Solomon, to replace him, people familiar with the matter said. \nThe timing of any moves could still change, and the 63-year-old Mr. Blankfein is firmly in control of his exit, the people said. The current thinking, though, is that he will retire ahead of or early in Goldman’s 150th anniversary year in 2019, a fitting send-off for the history buff.",
