In this partnership, Better4U pays for the product up front which eliminates the credit risks for Pulse. At Pulse’s current revenue run rates, this provides an easy doubling of sales.\nRobert E. Yates, CEO of Pulse, said, “We are pleased to be able to offer our products in the People’s Republic of China. Our partners have comprehensive consumer goods distribution relationships in the PRC and we are pleased to have a new to Pulse, population base of over 1.4 billion new consumers that we will introduce to our Natural Cabana® Coconut Waters.”\nMr. Yates continued, “This arrangement makes a lot of sense for Pulse. We have no distribution costs or credit risks in this business model. We collect from the customers in the PRC, reimburse Better4U for their cash outlays and record the entire transaction in Pulse’s books. Our partner is responsible for paying for the manufacturing up front as well as transit costs.”\nAbout Pulse Beverage Corporation:\nPulse Beverage Corporation (OTC:PLSB) is an emerging beverage company that offers Natural Cabana® Lemonade/Limeade in 7 great tasting, low-calorie flavors and Natural Cabana® Coconut Water in\npineapple and natural flavors.
