For the year, our Adjusted EBITDA was $44.6 million, a 104% increase over prior year primarily driven by improvements in our U.S. Drill Site business and the realization of our cost saving efforts in G&A. Our performance is indicative of a stabilization in the market and we are seeing the impact of our actions to increase market share of our Drill Site business.\"\n\"Looking forward to 2018, our Q1 Adjusted EBITDA guidance range is $10 million to $12 million, and our full year guidance remains unchanged at $50 million to $60 million. We anticipate steady improvements to our business in 2018 predicated on the continuation of the recent stabilization in commodity prices and associated activity levels. Our Adjusted EBITDA guidance for full year 2018 is based on a WTI forecast of $55 to $65 per barrel.\n\"On March 1, 2018, we announced we entered into an arrangement agreement with Tervita Corporation which provides for the combination of Newalta and Tervita, enhancing our businesses and creating a leading publicly traded energy-focused environmental solutions provider in Canada. The combined business will provide water processing, treating, recycling and disposal services to customers in the oil and gas, mining and industrial sectors. We are pleased to announce this milestone transaction, which offers our shareholders the opportunity to participate in the success of the combined businesses, improves our balance sheet and provides significant potential for value creation through realization of synergies and growth opportunities. We strongly believe that this combination is the most attractive path forward for Newalta, and we are committed to making the merger and ensuing integration a success.\"\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\nQ4 2017 revenue of $61.7 million decreased by 3% compared to prior year, driven by a decline in production related waste volumes at our Heavy Oil facilities partially offset by increased utilization in Drilling Services. Revenue for the year increased 20% to $246.4 million from $205.4 million in prior year, primarily driven by an increase in Drilling Services utilization and drilling and production related waste volumes received at our Canadian Oilfield Facilities. Net loss for the quarter was $12.3 million compared to $75.3 million in prior year. The year-over-year improvement primarily related to the $56 million of impairment recognized in Q4 2016. Net loss for the year improved from $158.5 million in the prior year to $48.2 million, due to impairment recognized in 2016 as well as increased contributions from the Oilfield division and reduced restructuring and other expense in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter remained flat at $11.6 million compared to prior year, as increased contributions realized by Drilling Services and cost savings in G&A were offset by decreased contributions from the Heavy Oil division. Adjusted EBITDA for 2017 was $44.6 million, an increase of $22.7 million over prior year. The 104% increase was driven by Divisional EBITDA improvements of $19.6 million and G&A savings of $3.1 million. Effective March 31, 2017, we amended and extended the terms of our Credit Facility to extend the waiver of our Total Debt to Covenant EBITDA covenant to Q2 2019 and to revise the Senior Debt to Covenant EBITDA and Interest Coverage covenant thresholds. Our contract model continued to provide predictable cash flow. These contracts are of varying lengths, generally are not tied directly to commodity price changes or drilling activity and provide a solid foundation for our business, particularly in depressed markets. In 2017, contracts represented 18% of our revenue.\nHeavy Oil\nIn the fourth quarter, Heavy Oil revenue decreased by 26% to $19.6 million primarily driven by decreased SAGD volumes received at our facilities. Net earnings before taxes in the quarter were $0.9 million, a $43.1 million improvement over prior year primarily due to impairment recognized in 2016. Divisional EBITDA decreased by 38% to $7.2 million in the quarter due to decreased contributions from our Facilities business unit. In 2017, Heavy Oil revenue remained flat at $88.2 million compared to prior year as increased demand for project work in Onsite and higher commodity prices were offset by a decrease in SAGD volumes received at our facilities. Net earnings before taxes for the year were $7.3 million, an improvement of $44.2 million over prior year primarily driven by the same factor as the quarter. Divisional EBITDA remained flat at $32.6 million compared to prior year due to the same factor as the quarter, partially offset by increased contributions from Onsite.\nOilfield\nIn the fourth quarter, Oilfield revenue increased 13% over prior year to $42.1 million primarily driven by improvements in Drilling Services. Net earnings before taxes in the quarter were $3.3 million, a $12.8 million improvement over prior year. The increase was primarily driven by impairment recognized in 2016 as well as increased contributions from Drilling Services, partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense. Divisional EBITDA increased by 48% over prior year to $11.3 million primarily as a result of improved drilling activity. In 2017, Oilfield revenue increased by 37% over prior year to $158.2 million due to improvements in both Drilling Services and Facilities. Net earnings before taxes for the year were $10.1 million, a $30.5 million improvement over prior year driven by the same factors as the quarter and reduced restructuring and other expense. Divisional EBITDA increased 108% over prior year to $40.0 million due to the same factors as the quarter.\nCorporate and Other\nCapital expenditures for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 were $5.0 million and $14.2 million, respectively, a decrease of 30% and 4% over prior year. Expenditures for the quarter and year have been primarily focused on maintenance projects. G&A decreased 10% to $6.9 million and $27.9 million, respectively, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017. The year-over-year improvement was driven by our disciplined approach to maintaining the benefit of the cost rationalization initiatives taken throughout the downturn. Restructuring and other recovery for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, were $1.3 million and $3.6 million compared to a recovery of $9.6 million and expense of $22.3 million in the prior year. The current year recovery is primarily comprised of a decrease to the non-cash decommissioning liabilities related to inactive sites, partially offset by a fair value loss on held-for-trading investment.\nRecent Developments\nOn February 28, 2018, we entered into an arrangement agreement (the \"Arrangement Agreement\") with Tervita Corporation (\"Tervita\"), pursuant to which Tervita has agreed, through a series of transactions, to acquire all of our issued and outstanding common shares on the basis of: (i) 0.1467 of a Class A Common share (\"Amalco Share\") of Amalco (as defined herein); and (ii) 0.0307 of one warrant to purchase one Amalco Share, for each outstanding common share of Newalta, and Newalta and Tervita will amalgamate to form \"Tervita Corporation\" (\"Amalco\"). Each Amalco Warrant will be exercisable for a period of two years from the closing of the Arrangement (as defined herein) at a price of $2.75 per equivalent common share of Newalta. The transaction is to be completed by way of a plan of arrangement (the \"Arrangement\") under the Business Corporations Act (Alberta). The Arrangement is subject to customary conditions for a transaction of this nature, which include, without limitation, court and regulatory approvals including the Toronto Stock Exchange and approval under the Competition Act (Canada), the approval of 66 2/3% of the votes cast by our securityholders represented in person or by proxy at an annual and special meeting of our securityholders to be called to consider the Arrangement (the \"Newalta Meeting\") and the approval of 66 2/3% of the votes cast by the shareholders of Tervita represented in person or by proxy at an annual and special meeting of the shareholders of Tervita to be called to consider the Arrangement (the \"Tervita Meeting\"). A joint information circular regarding the Arrangement is expected to be mailed to our securityholders and the shareholders of Tervita in early April 2018 for the Newalta Meeting and the Tervita Meeting, each scheduled to take place in late April 2018. Closing of the Arrangement is expected to occur upon receipt of all required regulatory approvals, including the approval under the Competition Act (Canada).\nThe following section contains forward-looking information as it outlines our Outlook for 2018. Our Outlook is based on several key assumptions including growth capital contributions, commodity prices and activity levels in the oil and gas industry. Changes to these assumptions could cause our actual results to differ materially. Please refer to our Forward-Looking Information later in this document. We are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties in carrying out our activities including market conditions, ability to expand the business, competition, regulation, and the ability to attract and retain personnel. A complete list of our risk factors is disclosed in our most recently filed Annual Information Form.\nOUTLOOK & BUSINESS DRIVERS\nOur business performance is tied to drilling and production related activities in western Canada and the United States. Sustained, stable oil and gas prices enable our customers to make capital decisions to invest in the drilling and completion of new wells and reactivation of shut-in wells. Activity levels, which correlate to the generation of production waste volumes, will vary among plays based on their cost profile. We provide enhanced value solutions to our customers, enabling them to extract greater value from their operations irrespective of cost profile.\nThe key drivers of our business performance are as follows:\nCrude Oil Prices\nCrude oil prices (primarily Canadian benchmarks WCS and CLS) directly impact the value of the products we recover from waste. Relative strength and stability of crude oil benchmarks impact confidence amongst producers and play a key role in determining their capital budgets, which in turn drives activity levels.\nDrilling Activity\nDrilling Services performance is driven by active rigs and is the first business line to respond to changes in activity. Wells drilled and completed in the areas we serve drive waste volumes into our facilities. Drilling activity in the areas we serve is dependent on the cost profile of the play, with low cost profile shale play activity being initiated at lower oil prices than the more expensive profile plays such as in heavy oil areas. At higher asset utilization levels, we generally see improved pricing for our services.\nProduction Impact & Other\nPrimarily comprised of the net impact of production waste volumes and shifts in waste mix, net impact of contributions from Onsite contracts and, to a lesser extent, customer pricing and operational efficiencies. We typically see a time lag between the deployment of producers' capital budgets, including turnarounds and workovers, and the subsequent production waste volume increases to our business. The composition of waste volumes impacts the degree of processing complexity and the amount of recoverable oil. CHOPS waste volumes are also dependent on the drilling of new wells to replace production volumes lost through their naturally steep decline curves. SAGD waste volumes are dependent on the number, timing and length of event-based upsets occurring in the normal course of SAGD facility operations. The timing and amount of mining contributions will be dependent on the approval of producers' mitigation plans to meet the Tailings Management Framework. We continue to work with producers to develop solutions to meet these requirements. We continue to prudently manage our operational and corporate cost structure.\nOutlook\nOur outlook for 2018 is based on our expectation of year-over-year trends including:\nIncreased commodity prices Strengthening WTI and CLS prices Minor improvement to WCS with the WTI-WCS differential remaining wide due to the impact of limitations on takeaway capacity Marginal increases in drilling and completions activity in the areas we serve Production related activity down slightly on a net basis, driven by: Reduction in midstream services, primarily related to the Pembina Phase III pipeline which came into service mid-2017 Lower event-based SAGD volumes Increased waste volumes at our Oilfield Facilities Incremental improvements in CHOPS waste volumes Disciplined focus on maintaining our streamlined cost structure and business processes\nOur Q1 and full-year 2018 guidance ranges are:\nRevenue of $50 million to $60 million for the first quarter and $235 million to $260 million for the full year; and Adjusted EBITDA of $10 million to $12 million for the first quarter and $50 million to $60 million for the full year.\nThe following table outlines the factors we expect to impact Adjusted EBITDA performance in the first quarter and full year of 2018:\nFactor\nActual (1)\nAssumption (1)\nExpected impact on Adjusted EBITDA\ncompared to prior year period (1)\nQ4 2017\nQ1 and Full Year 2018\nQ1 2018\n2018\nWest Texas Intermediate (US$/bbl)\nQ4: $55.38\n2017: $50.91\nQ1 2018: $60 – $65\n2018: $55 – $65\nCanadian Light Sweet (CDN$/bbl) (2)\nQ4: $66.93\n2017: $62.65\nQ1 2018: $70 – $75\n2018: $65 – $75\n$0M – $0.5M ↑\n$0.5M – $3M ↑\nWestern Canadian Select (CDN$/bbl) (2)\nQ4: $54.86\n2017: $50.54\nQ1 2018: $45 – $50\n2018: $47 – $55\nFlat\n$0.5M ↓ – $0.5M↑\nDrilling activity (2) over prior year\nQ4: 30%\n2017: 30%\nQ1 2018: 15% – 25%\n2018: 15% – 20%\n$1M – $2.5M ↑\n$3M – $8M ↑\nProduction Impact & Other (3)(4)\nQ4: ($4.1M)\n2017: $4.3M\n$1.5M ↓\n$2.5M – $4M ↑\nAdjusted EBITDA Guidance\n$10M – $12M\n$50M – $60M\n(1)\nM refers to millions.\n(2)\nImpact derived from annual sensitivities based on forecast performance and volumes outlined in the \"Sensitivities\" section of our annual 2017 MD&A. The actual impact from crude oil prices may vary with fluctuations in volumes.\n(3)\nThis factor is expected to have an impact on our performance through the year and cannot be quantified on any linear sensitivity.\n(4)\n2017 balances include Step Change and Savings from Cost Rationalization.\nTotal Debt, Capital & Cash Flow Management\nManagement continues to focus on moving towards a positive cash flow model and to date we have made significant progress through proactive management of operating cash flows and cost rationalization initiatives. In 2017, we made progress towards our near-term financial objective of cash flow neutral, ending the year with a $14.1 million cash draw. Moving into 2018, we will continue to maintain our focus on cash flow and exercise prudent judgment in managing our capital expenditures, in alignment with our longer-term target of positive cash flow.\nEffective March 31, 2017, we amended and extended the terms of our Credit Facility to extend the waiver of our Total Debt to Covenant EBITDA covenant to Q2 2019 and to revise the Senior Debt to Covenant EBITDA and Interest Coverage covenant thresholds. These amendments provide us with the flexibility to continue to manage our balance sheet as our performance improves. Managing debt leverage and use of cash and capital are our highest priorities. We expect to remain within our debt covenants throughout 2018.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis and Financial Statements\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements and MD&A, which contain additional notes and disclosures, are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com or our website at www.newalta.com under Investor Relations/Financial Reports.\nQuarterly Conference Call\nManagement will hold a conference call on March 7, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss Newalta's performance for the quarter.
