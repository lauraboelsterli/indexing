    "text": "2 COMMENTS Republican lawmakers worried about a trade war are cautioning President Donald Trump in their strongest terms yet that broad trade barriers risk hurting the economy and that Congress could take steps to rein in his trade authority.\nLawmakers have summoned the president’s top trade officials—U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross —for hastily arranged hearings this week on the coming tariffs .\nMr. Lighthizer will face House lawmakers Wednesday and U.S. senators on Thursday. Lawmakers are expected to ask about the timing of the tariffs, which countries will be exempted and the negotiations on the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta. Mr. Ross will testify Thursday at the House Ways and Means Committee, where lawmakers want details about how metal-consuming firms can be exempted from paying tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.\nThe Trump administration is set to implement global steel tariffs of 25% and aluminum tariffs of 10% on Friday. Administration officials are also preparing expansive actions to punish China over the alleged theft of American intellectual property, using a combination of tariffs on $30 billion or more of Chinese imports and other punishments, according to people familiar with the plans.\nMany Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans support Mr. Trump’s approach to trade, but the GOP majority is sounding the alarm over broad measures it believes will hurt the economy and trigger retaliation from trading partners , especially if they are implemented widely against allies.\n“As great as this president is, he’s occasionally wrong,” said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, at the Business Roundtable trade group Tuesday. “All of us are doing what we can to move our country off this dangerous course,” said Mr. Hatch, an ally of the president who has in the past tempered his criticism of the president.\nMr. Hatch said the first casualties of what may become a trade war are American manufacturers, who face higher metals prices, and farmers, some of whom have suffered apparent retaliation from China .\nMore\nTrump to Ramp Up Trade Restraints on China China to Target Trump’s Base in Tariff Response Lighthizer: WTO ‘Wholly Inadequate’ to Deal With China Investors Haven’t Been This Worried About Trade Wars in a While “The challenge for any president in tariffs is to ensure that ultimately you don’t punish Americans for China’s misbehavior,” said Rep. Kevin Brady, the chairman of the House committee, on Monday. Mr. Brady said he is pushing for tariff exceptions for existing contracts, exclusions for products largely made abroad and exemptions for allies.\nMessrs. Ross and Lighthizer have faced few public hearings on trade. In a taste of what could come later this week, Mr. Ross, in a hearing focused largely on the U.S. Census on Tuesday, faced warnings from lawmakers that they could potentially defund Mr. Trump’s trade efforts.\n“I find it odd that we’re engaged in a trade war,” said the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen (R., N.J.). “This committee provides the resources for all our trade negotiations, and it might be good to recognize in steps to follow after this hearing that communications can be improved.”\nRepublican congressional leaders have limited options for curtailing Mr. Trump’s trade actions without risking failure or political backlash. Congress has broad constitutional authority over tariffs, but it has ceded many powers to the executive branch over the past decade. Repealing those laws—and overriding a likely veto from Mr. Trump—would be difficult, aides say.\nAs well, Mr. Trump’s “America First” push is popular in many conservative areas, and many House Republicans are wary of challenging the president and potentially splitting the party in midterm elections.\nMr. Trump has said his predecessors allowed other nations to take advantage of the U.S. and destroy American industry. He has told steel and aluminum representatives that they had “been horribly treated by other countries” and acted this month to impose the tariffs on national-security grounds.\nMany in Congress, like Mr. Trump, are eager to use the laws their predecessors wrote to hold China or other trading partners accountable—but in a targeted fashion. “These are complex trade challenges, and American producers who haven’t gotten a fair shake in the past aren’t going to get that back by just having tariffs slapped on imports indiscriminately,” said Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), the top Democrat on the Senate committee, in an interview.\nMr. Hatch signaled Tuesday he will make use of his leverage over the president’s negotiating authority, needed for Mr. Trump’s effort to overhaul Nafta, with Canada and Mexico.\nMr. Trump, who has threatened to withdraw the U.S. from Nafta, is seeking the renewal in July of “trade promotion authority,” which paves the way for congressional passage of new or amended trade agreements. Mr. Hatch said Congress would make use of a provision that lets lawmakers review or possibly revoke the trade authority. Mr. Wyden said he is prepared to use that and other levers against Mr. Trump if administration officials “don’t tell us what’s going on and it looks like they’re going to hurt American workers.”\nOn Nafta, Mr. Ross said Tuesday that Mr. Trump’s “first choice is not to withdraw.”\n“But unless you are at the end of the day known to be prepared to take an extreme measure if the deal is lousy, you won’t win,” Mr. Ross told the appropriations hearing. “It’s very important that people understand that the status quo is not acceptable.”\nWrite to William Mauldin at william.mauldin@wsj.com and Josh Zumbrun at Josh.Zumbrun@wsj.com",
