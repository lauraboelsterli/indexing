    "text": "BURLINGTON, Mass., March 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nuance Communications, Inc . (NASDAQ:NUAN) today announced that William H. Janeway has retired from the Company’s Board of Directors. Nuance’s Board of Directors now consists of seven members, all of whom are independent directors.\nMr. Janeway joined the Nuance Board of Directors in April 2004 when he was Vice Chairman at Warburg Pincus. He was responsible for and oversaw Warburg Pincus’ investment in Nuance. During his years of service on the Nuance Board, Mr. Janeway was a vital, guiding influence on the Company’s strategy.\n“We are deeply appreciative of Bill’s 14 years of service as a director,” said Paul Ricci, CEO, Nuance. “Bill’s contributions have been fundamental to Nuance’s evolution, as we grew from a young company to become a leader in voice technology and solutions.”\nAs previously announced, the Board is working with a search firm to identify new directors as part of its Board refreshment. The Board expects to appoint one or two new directors prior to the 2019 Annual Meeting.\nThe Board also confirmed today that it is confident that it will name a new CEO by March 31, 2018, and that the new CEO will be appointed to the Board. Combined, this would represent the addition of four to five new directors in an approximately 12-month span.\nAbout Nuance Communications, Inc.\nNuance Communications, Inc.
