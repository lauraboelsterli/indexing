    "text": "March 30, 2018 / 1:43 PM / in 38 minutes Islamic State says behind car suicide bombing in east Libyan town Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Islamic State claimed responsibility on Friday for a suicide car bombing this week in the eastern Libyan town of Ajdabiya, the militant groupâ€™s news agency Amaq said on Friday. \nThe explosion struck a checkpoint on Thursday at the eastern exit of Ajdabiya, a town south of Benghazi, a military source said. It is close to the oil export ports of Brega and Zueitina. \nAmaq said 14 troops of General Khalifa Haftar had been killed of wounded. His forces allied to a parallel government based in the east control Ajdabiya and much of eastern Libya. \nAccording to medics, six people were killed and nine wounded. \nIslamic State, which lost in 2016 its stronghold Sirte in central Libya, had in October claimed an attack about 60 km (37 miles) south of Ajdabiya during which two soldiers were killed. \nThe group has retreated since the fall of Sirte to camps in the desert in southern Libya from where it has launched suicide bombings and attacks in coastal towns.
