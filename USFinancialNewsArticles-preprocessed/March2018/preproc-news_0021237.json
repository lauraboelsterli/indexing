Soccer Football - Championship - Aston Villa vs Wolverhampton Wanderers - Villa Park, Birmingham, Britain - March 10, 2018 Aston Villa's Henri Lansbury and John Terry celebrate after the match Action Images/Andrew Couldridge Albert Adomah put Villa in front after seven minutes after a goalmouth scramble but the lead lasted only 12 minutes as Diogo Jota levelled for Wolves from Matt Doherty’s cross. James Chester restored Villa’s lead when he prodded in a Robert Snodgrass free kick and Lewis Grabban made it 3-1 five minutes later with another close-range effort. When Icelandic midfielder Birkir Bjarnason toe-poked a shot past Wolves keeper John Ruddy in the 84th minute, the Villa fans could celebrate a victory that pushes them closer to the automatic promotion places. They are now four points behind Cardiff City, who beat struggling Birmingham City 3-2 and seven behind Wolves.
