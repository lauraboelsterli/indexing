We look forward to benefitting from her perspectives on Energy Fuels' many opportunities, including our 232 Petition on uranium, land cleanup work, vanadium production potential, and of course continuing to be the leader in U.S. uranium production.\"\nAbout Energy Fuels: Energy Fuels is a leading integrated U.S. uranium mining company, supplying U 3 O 8 to major nuclear utilities.
