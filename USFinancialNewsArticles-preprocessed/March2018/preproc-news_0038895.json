    "text": "0 COMMENTS Health-care companies are tapping executives from drugmakers as they seek out finance and other critical skills found outside their core business to help navigate a recent wave of consolidation.\nA flurry of mergers is transforming -care as patients increasingly get their medical services outside of hospitals, in smaller venues including drugstores. CVS Corp. is acquiring Aetna Inc. AET -0.33% for $79 billion. United Group Inc. announced plans for the $4.9 billion purchase of DaVita Inc.’s doctor group in December. And last month, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. WBA -0.66% made a takeover approach to drug distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC -5.03%\nAt the same time, these companies have made three high-profile executive hires from the pharmaceutical industry so far this month. CVS on Tuesday named Derica Rice, a former finance chief for drugmaker Eli Lilly LLY -2.19% & Co., to run its pharmacy benefit business. Walgreens appointed James Kehoe, formerly CFO of Takeda Pharmaceutical Co TKPYY 0.56% mpany Ltd., its new global finance chief. United named Andrew Witty, the former chief executive officer of drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline PLC as the new CEO of its Optum -services businesses. All three begin their new positions within the next few weeks and months.\nDeals that aim to integrate previously disparate businesses, as well as a push by Amazon.com Inc. to become a major medical products supplier to U.S. hospitals and outpatient clinics, will stoke demand for executives with broad experience, recruiters and consultants said.\n“To have a CFO or key executive who has a better understanding of how these businesses operate more holistically, it’s an underlying indicator of some of these broader trends,” said Per Hong, a partner at global management consulting firm A.T. Kearney.\nNewsletter Sign-up Companies are looking for executives who can add outside expertise, in an effort to keep costs down while integrating, said Tim Dietlin, a partner at executive recruitment firm Heidrick & Struggles International Inc.\n“This is a very nascent trend...the hope [is] that cross-pollination of talent and leadership will help inform the entire value chain and bring improvement to the industry,” he said, adding that the health-care sector had been known for its insular hiring practices.\nThere has been a notable shift in the last two to three years, Mr. Dietlin said.\nMr. Rice worked at Lilly for about 27 years, serving as finance chief from 2006 until his retirement in December. He was interim CEO at the Indianapolis drugmaker for a few months in 2013 when then-CEO John Lechleiter took a medical leave.\nHe will join CVS next week as head of its pharmacy benefit management, or PBM business, which acts as health-care middleman and helps select which drugs are covered for insured patients and negotiates discounts with drugmakers.\n“We selected Derica Rice as the new president of our CVS Caremark PBM business because he is a highly qualified executive with solid experience within the health-care sector,” said a CVS spokeswoman. “We believe his expertise in the pharmaceutical sector will help us continue to effectively serve our PBM clients’ needs while also developing and delivering innovative solutions and offerings that help us continue to evolve the business.”\nMr. Witty, who will join UnitedHealth’s Optum unit in July, retired from GlaxoSmithKline in 2016 after more than 30 years at the company.\nMr. Witty “brings more than three decades of health-care system strategic thinking and knowledge from around the globe, a record of fostering innovation and partnerships,” said David Wichmann, chief executive of UnitedHealth in a statement. “Critically, he has deep experience with how data and analytics and new technologies can be used to improve patient outcomes, better serve consumers, lower costs and drive value across the system.”\nMeanwhile, at Walgreens, Mr. Kehoe brings his experience as finance chief of Takeda and the consumer goods industry, including Mondelez International Inc. and Kraft Foods Group Inc.\nWalgreens and UnitedHealth declined to comment further.\nThe frenetic pace of deal-making in the health-care sector in recent months underscores the emerging sea change in how Americans seek medical care. There is a decline in hospital use under way sending companies scrambling to strengthen their position amid the shifting landscape.\n“If you are changing the dynamic that much your executive team needs to understand the manufacturer side of the industry, the provider side of the industry and the insurer side of the industry,” said Yogesh Bahl, a managing director of the life science practice at AlixPartners LLP, a global consulting firm.\nWrite to Ezequiel Minaya at ezequiel.minaya@wsj.com",
