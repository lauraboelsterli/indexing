Artcurial's employee poses as he holds the painting \"Raccommodeuses de filets dans les dunes, 1882\" (Women Mending Nets in the Dunes) by painter Vincent Van Gogh (1853-1890) during a preview for media at Artcurial Auction House in Paris, France March 28, 2018. REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes \nThe auction of the oil painting, entitled “Fishing Net Menders in the Dunes”, will be the first time Van Gogh’s work has been sold in France in more than two decades. \nPainted in 1882, early in the artist’s career, it was inspired by the countryside around The Hague, where Van Gogh passed a short but formative period in terms of his artistic style. \nAuctioneer Bruno Jaubert told Reuters the painting’s significance was underlined by the fact that it has spent the past 25 years hanging in some of the world’s most prestigious art museums. \n“Why? Because it is a painting which marks an important period in the development of Vincent Van Gogh. It’s the start of his career. And it’s when he discovers all the possibilities of painting, and notably how to create paintings in oil,” he said. \nAs the only landscape painted by the Dutch artist during this period in his career, it contains many elements that would later become emblematic of Van Gogh’s work, including heavy skies and crows, motifs which would resurface in his masterpiece “Wheatfield with Crows” in 1890. \nIn a letter to his brother Theo, Van Gogh recounted how struck he was by the spectacle of female peasants, who feature prominently in the painting, moving round the fields, their heads covered in white cloths. \nThe auction will take place in Paris from June 4.
