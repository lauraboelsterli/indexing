    "text": "BETHESDA, Md., March 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, BroadPoint , an award-winning business and technology consulting firm specializing in Microsoft Dynamics for nonprofits including ERP, CRM, and membership solutions, announced the acquisition of The Jitasa Group's Technology Solutions (TS) division.\nThe merger of these two highly respected partners provides the nonprofit community with a single, trusted source for their technology solutions, services and support. Both companies are excited about the expanded opportunities the acquisition brings to nonprofits.\nFormerly AVF Consulting, before being acquired by The Jitasa Group in 2016, Jitasa's TS division has delivered accounting and business management solutions to the nonprofit community for over 25 years. They specialize in implementation, training, and support services for Microsoft Dynamics NAV-based products, including Serenic Navigator, a robust accounting solution designed for nonprofits. Jitasa Founder and CEO, Jeff Russell, believes the union will help the nonprofit sector. He stated, \"BroadPoint's excellent reputation as one of the leading providers of Microsoft Dynamics for hundreds of nonprofit organizations was a perfect fit for us. They've been helping nonprofits for nearly two decades and have proven their continued dedication to this industry.\"\nWhen asked about the acquisition, BroadPoint CEO, Lee Raesly, stated, \"Jitasa's technology practice brings years of nonprofit experience that complements our own talent and industry focus. The acquisition benefits our nonprofit clients with a larger team and deeper consulting and technical expertise in Serenic Navigator and Microsoft Dynamics NAV.\"\nThis expansion is part of a long-term growth initiative to broaden BroadPoint's footprint in the nonprofit sector. Adds Raesly, \"The move adds a marquee list of nonprofit clients for us and jumpstarts our ability to deliver Microsoft's new cloud-based ERP software, Dynamics 365 Business Central, which is based on the Microsoft Dynamics NAV platform. We feel honored to help nonprofits simplify and improve processes so they can focus on driving their missions.\"\nAbout BroadPoint\nBroadPoint, Inc. is one of the largest Gold-Certified Microsoft Dynamics partners in the U.S. and the leading provider of Microsoft Dynamics solutions to associations and nonprofit organizations.
