If you're like most people, you'll find that you own shares of at least a few companies that make you squeamish. Perhaps you no longer wish to make money when Equifax collects and sells your data , especially when it has proved that it can't do so safely. Or perhaps you have soured on big banks that treat customers poorly .\nAnd it should come as no surprise that in the wake of the deadly Florida school shooting , some people would want to use their largest pool of capital — their investment portfolios — to single out the gun industry.\nFor those so inclined, the good news is this: There are more opportunities than ever to invest with a conscience. One firm, Wealthfront, will even let you strip individual American companies that rub you the wrong way from one of the index-fund-like portfolios it creates for you.\nMore from The New York Times:\nThe (long) list of financial documents you should keep\nDon't like your mortgage servicer? Good luck trying to switch\nSo it's your first market hiccup. What should you do now?\nBut with all these choices comes a fair bit of confusion. To land the biggest blow with whatever investing dollars you have, you'll first need to confront at least seven challenges.\nDefinition While mutual funds that aim to change the world for the better have existed for over 45 years, it's not clear even in 2018 what to call them . The term \"socially responsible\" seemed most apt for a while, then the awkward abbreviation E.S.G. came into vogue. It stands for environmental, social and governance.\nThe environmental part is easy enough to understand, and there are plenty of yes-no questions you can ask about how a company governs itself. But \"social,\" an echo of \"socially responsible,\" could mean nearly anything.\nshow chapters Investing in these stocks would have made you rich by now — here's other ways to invest your money 7:26 AM ET Wed, 29 Nov 2017 | 01:17 Jon Hale, who is the director of what the research firm Morningstar refers to as \"sustainable investing,\" suggests that people begin with two questions. First, do you want to align your investments with the transition to a low-carbon economy? Second, do you want to contribute to the development of a global economy that works for more people?\nIf you answer yes to either, you're a candidate for sustainable investing. And you can move on to the next challenge.\nMeasurement What funds are worth considering, and who evaluates them?\nIn a report in January , Morningstar published a list of 235 funds that you could use as a kind of menu. In 2016, the company also introduced a \" sustainability rating \" for more than 20,000 funds of all sorts. It describes the rating as a measure of how well funds handle environmental, social and governance issues compared with their peers.\nThere is no substitute, however, for examining the actual holdings of any fund. You never know, for instance, when a coal stock may somehow end up in your socially responsible fund. If that happens, it is worth figuring out why and determining whether it's a deal killer for you.\nExclusions What do you not want in your portfolio and why?\nIn the first couple of decades of sustainable investing, the funds that aimed to invest on principle often avoided, say, oil stocks. Some of this still goes on today. One fund company called Inspire, according to one of its prospectuses , avoids companies that have \"any degree of participation in activities that do not align with biblical values.\" It includes among that list \"the LGBT lifestyle,\" without further elaboration.\nDo you want gun stocks out of your portfolio? There may be mutual or exchange-traded funds that exclude them, but how far do you want to go? Publicly traded retailers like Walmart and Dick's Sporting Goods sell guns, after all, even if they don't make them. (This week, both companies announced new restrictions on gun sales.)\nPerformance The knock on this group of funds has always been that they tend to underperform the closest comparable index fund. That notion, however, may prove to be outdated.\nA 2015 study in the Journal of Sustainable Finance & Investment, which rounded up and examined about 2,200 pieces of research, found that about 90 percent of those studies showed no negative relationship between concern for social factors and corporate financial performance. A large majority, in fact, showed positive findings that were stable over time.\nshow chapters Jamie Foxx, Paris Hilton and other celebrities who are hyping cryptocurrencies 11:36 AM ET Wed, 20 Dec 2017 | 01:26 Cost and diversification If you're a committed index fund investor, seeking to own every stock or bond (or every sustainable one) in a particular market segment (say, small European companies), it may not be easy to do so cheaply if you can at all. And low costs, after all, are a primary attraction of index funds.\nBetterment, one of the so-called roboadvisers that use software to put people in inexpensive portfolios, introduced its socially responsible investing offering last year.
