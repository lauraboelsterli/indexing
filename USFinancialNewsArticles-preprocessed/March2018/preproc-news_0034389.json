    "text": "GREENWICH, Conn., TICC Capital Corp.

We have made this change in order to more closely align the branding and identity of the Company with its affiliated funds and with the investment platform operated by the affiliates of the Company’s investment adviser, which currently manage the portfolios of Oxford Lane Capital Corp. (NASDAQ:OXLC), a registered closed-end fund investing in debt and equity of collateralized loan obligation (“CLO”) vehicles, and Oxford Bridge, LLC, a private investment fund investing in CLO debt and equity.\nThe Company’s shares of outstanding common stock and outstanding notes are expected to trade under the new NASDAQ ticker symbols “OXSQ” and “OXSQL”, respectively, on or about March 23, 2018.\nAbout Oxford Square Capital Corp.\nOxford Square Capital Corp. is a publicly-traded business development company principally investing in syndicated bank loans and debt and equity tranches of CLO vehicles. CLO investments may also include warehouse facilities, which are financing structures intended to aggregate loans that may be used to form the basis of a CLO vehicle.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements subject to the inherent uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions.
