Soccer Football - Championship - Cardiff City vs Barnsley - Cardiff City Stadium, Cardiff, Britain - March 6, 2018 Cardiff City's Marko Grujic celebrates scoring their second goal with team mates Action Images/Peter Cziborra Wolves, who visit Leeds United on Wednesday, have seen a 13-point advantage at the summit gradually whittled away and are now looking anxiously over their shoulders. Their nearest pursuers all won on Tuesday with third-placed Aston Villa thrashing Sunderland 3-0 away and Fulham in fourth beating Sheffield United by the same score at Craven Cottage. Soccer Football - Championship - Cardiff City vs Barnsley - Cardiff City Stadium, Cardiff, Britain - March 6, 2018 Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock celebrates at full time Action Images/Peter Cziborra Cardiff, who beat Barnsley with goals from Callum Paterson and a fine strike from Liverpool loanee Marko Grujic, have 70 points, while Villa have 66 with Fulham a further point behind. Villa swept aside bottom team Sunderland with goals from Lewis Grabban and James Chester while Bryan Oviedo’s own goal rounded off the scoring at the Stadium of Light. Fulham cruised past playoff rivals Sheffield United with two goals from Aleksandar Mitrovic, on loan from Premier League Newcastle United, before captain Tom Cairney added a third in the second half. Second-bottom Burton Albion’s plight looks bleak after a 2-0 loss at home to Brentford while Birmingham City, in the final relegation place, lost 1-0 to visitors Middlesbrough in sixth, leaving the Blues two points behind Barnsley in the safety zone.
