    "text": "(Recasts with result of EIG’s buyout offer)\nSAO PAULO, March 9 (Reuters) - Private equity firm EIG Global Energy Partners LLC has bought out Brazilian logistics company Prumo Logistica SA, after 18 months of negotiations with its minority shareholders, Prumo said on Friday.\nControlling shareholder EIG needed the acceptance of two-thirds of the minority shareholders to its offer to pay 11.50 reais ($3.53) per share. It reached that mark and Prumo will consequently be delisted by EIG, Prumo said in a securities filing on Friday.\nThe transaction is worth around 541 million reais ($166 million). ($1 = 3.2573 reais) (Reporting by Carolina Mandl Editing by Phil Berlowitz and Rosalba O’Brien)\n ",
