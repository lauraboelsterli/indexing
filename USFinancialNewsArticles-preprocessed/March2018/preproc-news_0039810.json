    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Midas Gold Corp. (TSX:MAX) (OTCQX:MDRPF) today reported that it has appointed Javier Shiffrin, Senior Vice President, Paulson & Co. Inc., to its board of directors following the resignation of Victor Flores. Mr. Schiffrin was nominated by Paulson & Co. under the investor rights agreement entered into with Midas Gold in relation to the March 2016 financing that was backstopped by Paulson & Co. Mr. Flores had been appointed to the board in 2016 as one of Paulson & Co.’s two nominees under that agreement.\n“We welcome Mr. Schiffrin to the board of directors of Midas Gold and look forward to working with him and the other directors to oversee the advancement of the Stibnite Gold Project in Idaho,” said Peter Nixon, Chairman of the board of Midas Gold Corp. “We also thank Mr. Flores for his service as a director of Midas Gold and for his contributions to the progress we have made over the past two years. Mr. Flores was instrumental in negotiating the 2016 financing that allowed us to advance into the permitting process and commence the feasibility study for the redevelopment and restoration of the former mine site at Stibnite.”\n“Paulson & Co. continues to value its investment in Midas Gold, which controls a world class gold project in Idaho. We look forward to our continued engagement with the other board members in advancing the Stibnite Gold Project through the completion of a feasibility study and the permitting process for the restoration and redevelopment of the Stibnite Gold Project site,” said Marcelo Kim, Partner at Paulson & Co., and a director of Midas Gold Corp.\nMr. Schiffrin is a Senior Vice President at Paulson & Co., with a focus on distressed debt investments and restructurings. Prior to that he was an Executive Director & Restructuring Specialist at Macquarie Capital, and a Restructuring Attorney at Kirkland & Ellis. He is a graduate of McGill University where he earned a Bachelor of Arts, First Class Honors; and Columbia Law School where he earned a Juris Doctorate and was a James Kent Scholar. Mr. Schiffrin holds both US and Canadian citizenship.\nFor further information about Midas Gold Corp., please contact:\nLiz Monger – Manager, Investor Relations\n(t) 778.724.4704\n(e): info@midasgoldcorp.com\nwww.facebook.com/midasgoldidaho\n@MidasIdaho\nwww.midasgoldcorp.com\nAbout Midas Gold\nMidas Gold Corp., through its wholly owned subsidiaries Midas Gold Idaho, Inc., Idaho Gold Resources, LLC and Stibnite Gold Company, is focused on the exploration and, if warranted, redevelopment of deposits in the Stibnite‐Yellow Pine district of central Idaho that comprise the Stibnite Gold Project.
