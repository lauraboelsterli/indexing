    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abattis Bioceuticals Corp. (the \" Company \" or \" Abattis \") (CSE:ATT) (OTC:ATTBF) is pleased to announce that, further to its news release dated February 27, 2018, it has completed its acquisition (the “ Acquisition ”) of a 90% ownership interest in Gabriola Green Farms Inc. (“ Gabriola ”).\nGabriola is a British Columbia company that has applied for a license to produce (an “ LP ”) under the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations (“ ACMPR ”) on Gabriola Island, one of the gulf islands located in the Strait of Georgia off the coast of British Columbia. Gabriola Island has a consistent temperature and humidity level, which makes it well suited to greenhouse growing.\n“We are excited to complete our acquisition of Gabriola. Gabriola’s anticipated LP will complete our suite of downstream offerings and be the highlight of our growth into a full-service cannabis company,” stated Rob Abenante, Abattis President and CEO.\nGabriola currently has plans for an approximately 26,000 square-foot production facility to produce medical-grade marijuana located on 18 acres in the agricultural land reserve on Gabriola Island, BC. The facility will include a level 8 security vault.\nGabriola’s production facilities are expected to be constructed in two phases:\nPhase 1 - Buildout of its 6,000-square-foot state-of-the-art facility, consistent with ACMPR standards.\nPhase 2 - Upon completion of the Phase 1 buildout, Gabriola will build out an expansion of approximately 20,000 square feet.\nIn connection with the Acquisition, the Company issued an aggregate of 61,307,902 common shares of the Company and paid $2.5 million in cash to the shareholders of Gabriola. In connection with the Acquisition, Abattis has also secured (i) a right of first refusal on the remaining 10% ownership interest in Gabriola from CannaNUMUS Blockchain Inc. and (ii) an option to acquire the lands on which Gabriola’s operations are conducted for $7 million until February 27, 2023 from an unrelated third-party.\nAbout Abattis Bioceuticals Corp.\nAbattis is a life sciences and biotechnology company which aggregates, integrates, and invests in cannabis technologies and biotechnology services for the legal cannabis industry developing in Canada.

The use of any of the words \"anticipate\", \"continue\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"may\", \"will\", \"project\", “intends”, \"should\", \"believe\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this press release include statements regarding: Gabriola’s LP application and the expected effect the LP, once received, will have on Abattis’s business profile and offerings; Gabriola’s plans for an approximately 26,000 square foot production facility, including respecting the two expected phases of such buildout. Although the Company believes that the expectations and assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because the Company can give no assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including: that Gabriola’s application for an LP will be unsuccessful; that, once received, the effect of Gabriola’s LP on Abattis’s business profile and offerings will not be as expected; that Gabriola’s construction plans will not come to fruition or will not be carried out as expected; that the Company will not be able to execute its proposed business plan in the time required or at all due to regulatory, financial or other issues; that the Company’s competitors may develop competing technologies; changes in regulatory requirements; and other factors beyond the Company’s control. Additional risk factors are included in the Company's Management's Discussion and Analysis, available under the Company's profile on www.sedar.com . The forward-looking statements are made as at the date hereof and the Company disclaims any intent or obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, where because of new information, future events or results, or otherwise, except as required by applicable securities laws.\nNEITHER THE CANADIAN SECURITIES EXCHANGE NOR ITS REGULATIONS SERVICES PROVIDER HAS REVIEWED OR ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS RELEASE.\nSource:Abattis Bioceuticals Corp.",
