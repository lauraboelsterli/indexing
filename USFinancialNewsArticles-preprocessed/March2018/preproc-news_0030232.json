REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth/File Photo Savills, which operates in Britain, continental Europe, Asia-Pacific and the United States, said it had made a solid start to the year but demand could fall in some areas. “We have made a solid start to 2018 with a pipeline of business carried over from last year in many markets, although this is against the backdrop of heightened market uncertainty, geopolitical risks and rising interest rates,” said Chief Executive Jeremy Helsby. ​ “We anticipate a tempering of the strong transaction volumes of recent times in some markets.” ($1 = 0.7155 pounds)",
