    "text": "DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BioScrip, Inc. (NASDAQ: BIOS) (\"BioScrip\" or the \"Company\"), the largest independent national provider of infusion and home care management solutions, today announced its preliminary 2017 financial results and provided financial guidance for 2018, subject to the completion of the Company’s accounting review described below.\n4Q 2017 Preliminary Highlights\nNet revenue of $182.6 million, including core product mix of 75.7%, compared to 69.6% in the prior year quarter Net loss from continuing operations of $1.2 million, compared to $5.2 million in the prior year quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $16.8 million, 77% above the prior year quarter, driven by a 740 basis point improvement in gross profit margin and a $11.6 million reduction in operating expenses Operating cash flow of $10.1 million, reflecting $15.2 million of operational and working capital improvements over the prior year quarter, and $6.9 million of interest payments Liquidity of $49.5 million at December 31, 2017, consisting of $39.5 million of cash and equivalents and $10.0 million of senior credit facility availability, compared to $9.6 million of total liquidity at December 31, 2016\n2017 Preliminary Highlights\nNet revenue of $817.2 million, including core product mix of 73.8%, compared to 63.3% in the prior year Net loss from continuing operations of $61.3 million, compared to $34.4 million in the prior year Adjusted EBITDA of $45.0 million, 45% above the prior year, driven by a 480 basis point improvement in gross profit margin and a $10.3 million reduction in operating expenses Operating cash flow of $5.8 million, reflecting $51.6 million of operational and working capital improvements over the prior year, and $45.4 million of interest payments\n“BioScrip concluded 2017 with strong fourth quarter financial results, delivering significant year-over-year increases in core revenue mix, gross profit margin, adjusted EBITDA and cash provided by operating activities. Our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $16.8 million, a record amount, indicates our turnaround plan is working,” said Daniel E. Greenleaf, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The initiatives we launched in 2017 are producing strong results and continuing to build momentum. We look forward to more progress in 2018, growing our core business and expanding our profitability, while making select investments in people, technology, and infrastructure setting up BioScrip to have a break out year in 2019. Our expectation for 2019 is to deliver a minimum of $75 million of Adjusted EBITDA, resulting from core revenue growth at or above market rates and continued gross margin expansion and operating expense leverage, coupled with the benefit of the Cures Fix. As the only independent national home infusion pure play, we are uniquely positioned to benefit as patient care increasingly migrates from higher-cost institutional settings to the home, where better outcomes are also achieved.\"\nFinancial Guidance\nFor full year 2018, the Company is establishing revenue guidance of $710 million to $720 million and adjusted EBITDA guidance of $54 million to $58 million. The Company expects to incur restructuring expenses of between $5 million and $6 million in 2018, primarily reflecting costs related to redesigning and optimizing its revenue cycle management process. The Company expects capital expenditures in 2018 to be between $12 million and $14 million, reflecting continued maintenance capital expenditures as well anticipated investments in select branches to support growth.\nThe above guidance does not reflect the adoption of ASC 606, a new revenue accounting standard to be adopted in the first quarter of 2018, that requires certain bad debt expenses to be reclassified as a deduction to revenue. The adoption of ASC 606 is not expected to impact the Company’s reported operating income or adjusted EBITDA. The Company expects that, as a result of adopting ASC 606, that a majority of its bad debt expense will be reclassified as a deduction to revenue. The Company will provide updated revenue guidance to reflect the adoption of ASC 606 when it releases its first quarter 2018 financial results.\nCompany’s Internal Accounting Review\nAs a result of the detailed review of the Company’s financial statements performed by the Company’s CFO and interim-CAO during the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for the full year 2017, the Company identified internal control deficiencies in connection with account reconciliations for certain asset and liability accounts. The potential financial statement errors discovered to date resulting from these internal control deficiencies do not appear to be material, but the review is ongoing. The Company, along with its external auditors, continues to review the possible errors and, if required, will reflect any necessary revisions and may report one or more internal control material weaknesses in its upcoming Form 10-K filing. Depending on the timing of the completion of this review, the Company may need to delay the filing of the Form 10-K.\nSeparately, the Company has identified and will report a material weakness related to certain spreadsheets used to calculate periodic adjustments to accounts that do not impact Adjusted EBITDA, including amortization of intangible assets, equity-linked liabilities and the amortization of discounts and deferred issuance costs of debt. The material weakness did not have any effect on the Company’s 2017 financial statements.\nConference Call and Presentation\nBioScrip will host a conference call and live webcast on March 8, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time, to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results. Interested parties may participate by dialing 877-423-9820 (US) or by accessing a link under the \"Investors\" section on the Company's website at www.bioscrip.com .\nAn audio webcast and archive will be available within two hours of the call’s completion under the “Investors\" section of the Company's website.\nAbout BioScrip, Inc.\nBioScrip, Inc. is the largest independent national provider of infusion and home care management solutions, with approximately 2,200 teammates and nearly 80 service locations across the U.S. BioScrip partners with physicians, hospital systems, payors, pharmaceutical manufacturers and skilled nursing facilities to provide patients access to post-acute care services.

You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as \"may,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"project,\" \"outlook,\" \"aim,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" \"continue\" or comparable terms. Because such statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties, actual future results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement include but are not limited to risks associated with: the Company’s ability to make principal and interest payments on our debt and unsecured notes and satisfy the other covenants contained in its debt agreements; the Company’s ability to grow its core Infusion revenues; the Company's ability to continue to execute its financial improvement plan to reduce operating costs and focus its business on its Infusion Services segment; the Company’s ability to evaluate opportunities for improvement and implement solutions as part of its strategic review process; the success of the Company’s initiatives to mitigate the impact of the Cures Act on its business; reductions in federal, state and commercial reimbursement for the Company's products and services; increased government regulation related to the health care and insurance industries; as well as the risks described in the Company's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company does not undertake any duty to update these forward-looking statements after the date hereof, even though the Company's situation may change in the future. All of the forward-looking statements herein are qualified by these cautionary statements.\nNote Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to reporting financial information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company is also reporting Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute or alternative to net income, operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as a substitute or alternative to cash flow from operating activities or a measure of the Company’s liquidity. In addition, the Company's definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by the Company, represents net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment of goodwill, stock-based compensation expense, and restructuring, integration and other expenses. As part of restructuring, the Company may incur significant charges such as the write down of certain long−lived assets, temporary redundant expenses, retraining expenses, potential cash bonus payments and potential accelerated payments or terminated costs for certain of its contractual obligations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful supplemental information regarding the performance of BioScrip’s business operations and facilitates comparisons to the Company’s historical operating results. For a full reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable GAAP financial measure, please see the attachment to this earnings release.\nSchedule 1 BIOSCRIP, INC.
