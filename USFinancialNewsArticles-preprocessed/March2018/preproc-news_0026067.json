    "text": "March 13, 2018 / 1:06 PM / Updated 9 minutes ago European stocks, bond yields fall on U.S. politics Reuters Staff   European stocks and government bond yields fell on Tuesday following news that U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has been replaced. The German share price index, DAX board, is seen at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, March 13, 2018. REUTERS/Staff/Remote U.S. President Donald Trump said he had replaced Tillerson with Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo, and had tapped Gina Haspel to lead the CIA. Europe’s STOXX 600 fell to a session low, down 0.3 percent on the news. The pan-European banks index .SX7P also tumbled to the day’s low, down 0.2 percent. Yields on safe-haven bonds in the euro zone also fell, with Germany’s 10-year bond yield touching a fresh 1-week low at 0.608 percent DE10YT=RR. The dollar, meanwhile, extended its fall. It had already been weak across other G10 currencies after U.S. inflation data came in as per forecasts but it skidded further as the sell-off accelerated. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar fell 0.2 percent .DXY, while the euro gained 0.3 percent to $1.2369 EUR= . The greenback gave up half of its gains versus the Japanese yen JPY= , with the pair last trading at 106.83, the yen down 0.4 percent on the day.
