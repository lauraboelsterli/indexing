    "text": "March 30, 2018 / 11:39 AM / Updated 10 minutes ago Poland's president vetoes bill demoting martial law officers Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nWARSAW (Reuters) - Poland’s president Andrzej Duda, an ally of the right-wing government, on Friday vetoed a law that would demote Communist military officers who were responsible for introducing martial law in 1981. Poland's president Andrzej Duda delivers a statement refusing to sign the bill stripping the rank of members of the communist military council, that imposed martial law in Warsaw, Poland, March 30, 2018. Agencja Gazeta/Slawomir Kaminski/ via REUTERS \n“I refuse to sign this bill and I am sending it back to parliament to discuss it again,” Duda said in a televised address, describing it as unfair. \nThe bill would have reduced to the rank of private those generals and military officers who served on the military council which ran Poland during communist times from December 1981 until July 1983, many of who are now deceased. \nThey would have had no right of appeal.

REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/File Photo \nDuda’s move may be seen as a bid to improve his chances for re-election in 2020. Support for the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), his ally, fell 12 percentage points over one month in a poll published on Thursday. \n“One has to remember that a president who wants to win in the first or second round has to win much more votes than the ruling party in a general election,” Rafal Chwedoruk, a political scientist from Warsaw University, said.

REUTERS/Alexander Natruskin/File Photo \n“A recent poll has shown that the vast majority of Poles are against demoting generals. ... The number of PiS voters from villages and small towns accepted the decision on imposing martial law,” Chwedoruk said. \nThe PiS has made much of its efforts to erase the legacy of four decades of post-war Soviet-dominated communist rule and restore what it considers to be Poland’s true identity - even though some leading PiS figures are former communists. \nThe law would demote to the rank of private members of the Military Council of National Salvation (WRON), led by the late generals Wojciech Jaruzelski and Czeslaw Kiszczak. \nBut it would also demote 77-year-old Miroslaw Hermaszewski, Poland’s only astronaut, one of the few WRON members still alive, who was drafted onto the council in 1981 without his knowledge or consent, and discharged from it after two weeks. \nHermaszewski spent almost eight days on board the Soviet Salyut space station in 1978, and is still seen as a national hero, also by PiS voters.
