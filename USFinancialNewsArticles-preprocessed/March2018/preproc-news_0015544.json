The ECB, which targets inflation at just below 2 percent, sees price growth at 1.4 percent this year and next, picking up to 1.7 percent in 2020, ECB President Mario Draghi told a news conference. Economic growth this year was seen at 2.4 percent versus an earlier 2.3 percent forecast. The following are the ECB staff's new projections for inflation and GDP growth, with December forecasts in brackets. The ECB updates projections once a quarter. 2018 2019 2020 GDP growth 2.4 (2.3) 1.9 (1.9) 1.7 (1.7) Inflation 1.4 (1.4) 1.4 (1.5) 1.7 (1.7) (Reporting by Balazs Koranyi Editing by Catherine Evans)",
