    "text": "CRANFORD, N.J., March 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- TOFUTTI BRANDS INC. (OTCQB Symbol: TOFB) issued its results for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017 today.\nThe Company reported net income of $704,000 ($0.14 per share) on net sales of $14,107,000 for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017 compared to net income of $421,000 ($0.08 per share) on net sales of $14,473,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.\nSales of vegan cheese products increased to $11,237,000 in fiscal 2017 from $10,863,000 in fiscal 2016, due to the introduction of the Company's Whipped Better Than Cream Cheese and improved distribution of its Better Than Ricotta product. Sales of the Company's frozen dessert and frozen food product lines decreased to $2,870,000 in fiscal 2017 from $3,610,000 in fiscal 2016. In 2017, the Company's frozen dessert business continued to be negatively impacted by the overall sluggish sales in the ice cream category and also by a co-packer's decision to cease manufacturing the Company's stick novelties and Yours Truly Cones in June 2017. The unavailability of these items negatively impacted sales of the Company's frozen desserts.\nThe Company's gross profit in the year ended December 30, 2017 increased by $149,000 to $4,740,000, and its gross profit percentage increased to 34% from 32% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The gross profit and gross profit percentage were positively impacted by the increase in domestic sales of vegan cheese products, which offset the decline in foreign sales.\nAs of December 30, 2017, the Company had approximately $1,414,000 in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of $3,721,000 compared with $132,000 in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of $2,949,000 at December 31, 2016.\n\"I am pleased to report that in fiscal 2017 we improved our earnings, cash and working capital positions. We continue to see new opportunities for our vegan cheese product line, which is a category leader. We intend to capitalize on our strong vegan cheese sales with the introduction of a new line of vegan dips and shredded cheddar and mozzarella soy cheeses in the third quarter of 2018. The introduction of these new products and the realization of price increases that were instituted in the last year are expected to maintain our margins in 2018. We also hope to be able to offer a full line of frozen dessert products prior to the summer season,\" concluded David Mintz, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Tofutti Brands.\nAbout Tofutti Brands Inc.
