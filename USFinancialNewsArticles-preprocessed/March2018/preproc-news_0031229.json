    "text": "March 15, 2018 / 11:32 AM / Updated 38 minutes ago Nigeria's central bank to delay rate meeting - governor Reuters Staff 1 Min Read LAGOS, March 15 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s central bank will delay its next interest rate-setting meeting after a political spat over nominations for its Monetary Policy Committee, the governor said on Thursday. Governor Godwin Emefiele told CNBC the meeting scheduled for March 19-20 would be delayed by about seven to 10 days, or at the latest until the first week of April. Nigeria’s Senate will next week consider a report into nominations for the central bank’s monetary policy committee, its president said on Wednesday, a move that could end an impasse that has halted policy decisions.
