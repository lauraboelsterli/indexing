Here's how to see who you're friends with, and how to quickly unfriend people.

To unfriend someone, tap the button that says \"Friends\" and then select \"Unfriend.\" From the Facebook app It's easy to unfriend people. On the most recent Facebook app things are a bit easier. First, tap the icon on the bottom right side of the screen that looks like a hamburger (or three lines in a row.) Tap \"Friends.\" Todd Haselton Technology Product Editor Related Securities ",
