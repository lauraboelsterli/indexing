    "text": "March 19, 2018 / 4:22 PM / Updated 23 minutes ago Countries propose IMF set up fund for Venezuelan refugees: Meirelles Reuters Staff 1 Min Read BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Countries concerned with the crisis in Venezuela will propose that the International Monetary Fund set up a pool of resources to assist the tens of thousands of Venezuelan refugees that have fled, Brazil Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles said on Monday. Speaking to reporters after a meeting of finance ministers on Venezuela on the sidelines of a G20 summit, he said the fund would be for use outside Venezuela and not by President Nicolas Maduro’s “regime.” Brazil is demanding Venezuela repay a $1.3 billion debt, unlike Russia and China that want a moratorium that would suspend Venezuelan payments, Meirelles said.
