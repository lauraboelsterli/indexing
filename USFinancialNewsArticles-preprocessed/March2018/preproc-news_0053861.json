    "text": "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina said on Wednesday it plans to issue $4.2 billion in peso-denominated bonds at an interest rate of 6.73 percent as part of a fiscal pact signed late last year aimed at bolstering the financial position of the country’s provinces.\nThe debt is scheduled to be issued April 3 and will offer 125 monthly payments through the end of 2028, according to the government’s official gazette. Proceeds will be distributed among most of Argentina’s provinces.\nUnder the fiscal pact, signed soon after President Mauricio Macri’s coalition turned in a stronger-than-expected showing in October congressional elections, nearly all of Argentina’s 24 provinces agreed not to hike spending above the inflation rate and to lower some taxes.\nTo get the money, provinces agreed to drop pending litigation against the national government for underpayment of fiscal resources owed under Argentina’s co-participation rules.\nThe bonds issued on April 3 will not be traded in the secondary market, according to the announcement in the gazette.
