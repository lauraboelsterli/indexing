TORONTO, March 20 (Reuters) - Canada’s financial watchdog said on Tuesday it is investigating breaches of market conduct obligations by banks following a review of sales practices within the industry. The Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) said its study also found that the retail banking sales culture within banks may raise risks for consumers, and that financial incentives for staff may increase the risk of mis-selling. The FCAC launched its investigation a year ago after reports by CBC News that employees at some of the country’s largest banks had opened accounts for products and services for consumers without properly obtaining their expressed consent. “Banks are in the business of making money. We know that. But the way they sell financial products and manage employee performance, combined with how they set up their governance frameworks can lead to sales cultures that are not always aligned with consumers’ interests,” FCAC Commissioner Lucie Tedesco said in a statement. The FCAC said it was proposing a number of measures banks could take to reduce those risks and would beef up its enforcement teams to allow it to monitor banks more proactively. It said its report would be shared with government officials. (Reporting by Matt Scuffham; Editing by Bernadette Baum)",
