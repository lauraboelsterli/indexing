Net sales of the New Business (the wood-based activated carbon, reactivation, and mineral-based filtration media business acquired in November 2016) increased $13.9 million to $26.0 million, compared to reported post-acquisition net sales of $12.1 million for the months of November and December of 2016. Calgon Carbon’s legacy business net sales increased $10.1 million, or 8.1%, from $125.4 million in last year’s fourth quarter. The increases in New Business and legacy business net sales include $1.3 million and $2.3 million, respectively, of net favorable foreign currency translation primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar.\nIncome from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $15.6 million, compared to a loss from operations of ($5.4) million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $9.4 million, or $0.19 per fully diluted share. This compares to a net loss of ($5.9) million, or ($0.12) per fully diluted share, for the same period last year. Fourth quarter 2017 results include a $4.1 million (pre-tax) gain on sale of an idled UK plant and $1.3 million (pre-tax) of expenses related to the Company’s pending merger with Kuraray Co., Ltd. (Kuraray). Fourth quarter 2016 results include $13.7 million (pre-tax) of acquisition 1 and project-related costs.\nNote: Beginning January 1, 2017, the Company realigned its internal management reporting structure to incorporate the New Business into the Company’s previously existing legacy business and reorganized its reportable segments into: Activated Carbon, Alternative Materials, and Advanced Water Purification. The Company is reporting its 2017 fourth quarter and twelve months results using these reportable segments, and has restated reportable segment information for the comparable prior year periods to conform to the new structure.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, Activated Carbon segment net sales were $143.9 million, an increase of $18.2 million, or 14.5%, from $125.7 million of net sales reported for the same period a year ago. Net sales related to the New Business were $14.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of $7.6 million compared to the two months of New Business net sales reported in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net sales related to Calgon Carbon’s Activated Carbon segment legacy business were $129.9 million, an increase of $10.6 million, or 8.9%. The net favorable impact from currency translation contributed $0.7 million and $2.2 million to the increase in New Business and legacy business net sales, respectively. The remaining increase in legacy business net sales was primarily driven by higher potable water end market demand in North America and Europe, as well as increased food and beverage, environmental air and specialty end market demand in Asia.\nAlternative Materials segment net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $13.7 million, a $6.1 million increase compared to $7.6 million for the same period a year ago. The increase is primarily due to the current year fourth quarter including a complete quarter of New Business net sales of diatomaceous earth and perlite filtration media products, versus only two months in last year’s fourth quarter. The net favorable impact from currency translation contributed $0.7 million to the net sales increase, primarily related to sales of the New Business.\nNet sales in the Advanced Water Purification segment decreased slightly to $3.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $4.1 million in the same period last year.\nNet sales less the cost of products sold (excluding depreciation and amortization), as a percentage of net sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 30.8%, comparable to the 31.0% reported for last year’s fourth quarter.\nDepreciation and amortization expense was $11.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $10.8 million in last year’s fourth quarter. Current year fourth quarter depreciation and amortization expense includes a complete quarter of expenses from the acquired fixed assets and intangible assets of the New Business.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and research and development (R&D) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $26.9 million, or 16.7% of net sales, versus $37.3 million, or 27.1% of net sales, in last year’s fourth quarter. Current year SG&A and R&D expenses include costs of $1.3 million, or 0.8% of net sales, related to the pending merger with Kuraray. Fourth quarter 2016 SG&A and R&D expenses include $12.2 million, or 8.9% of net sales, related to acquisition 1 and project-related costs.\nOther operating income represents a $4.1 million pre-tax gain from the sale of an idled UK plant.\nInterest expense - net for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.2 million compared to $1.2 million in last year’s fourth quarter. The increase was primarily due to a complete quarter of higher debt levels resulting primarily from the Company’s purchase of the New Business, as well as higher interest rates in the current year.\nThe effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 25.9% compared to 33.5% in last year’s fourth quarter. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in earnings in tax jurisdictions with tax rates lower than the 2017 U.S. statutory rate and non-taxable income. This was partially offset by $0.6 million of income tax expense related to the 2017 estimated impact of U.S. tax reform 2 .\nFull Year 2017 Summary\nNet sales for 2017 were $619.8 million compared to net sales of $514.2 million last year. The New Business contributed $104.0 million and $12.1 million to 2017 and 2016 net sales, respectively. Calgon Carbon’s legacy business net sales increased 2.7% to $515.8 million from $502.1 million in 2016.\nThe Company reported 2017 income from operations of $42.2 million versus $24.5 million in 2016. Net income for 2017 was $21.1 million versus $13.8 million last year. Earnings per common share on a fully diluted basis for 2017 were $0.42, as compared to $0.27 for 2016. Results for 2017 were negatively impacted by $2.4 million (pre-tax) of acquisition 1 and project-related costs and $4.6 million (pre-tax) of expenses related to the pending merger with Kuraray, which were partially offset by a $4.1 million (pre-tax) gain on the sale of an idled UK plant. Results for 2016 were negatively impacted by acquisition 1 and project-related costs of $17.2 million (pre-tax).\nCEO Commentary\n“A second consecutive quarter of solid operational and financial performance capped off a successful and eventful year for Calgon Carbon, providing us with positive momentum as we move into 2018,” said Randy Dearth, Calgon Carbon’s Chairman, President, and CEO.\n“Despite being confronted with slow and challenging market conditions – particularly early in the year – our talented employees around the world were able to drive positive results and produce numerous achievements that will benefit Calgon Carbon going forward. These included:\nCompleting the integration of the New Business and exceeding our $100 million sales target for the year. On top of that, we completed a de-bottlenecking project at the wood-based activated carbon manufacturing facility in France, and look forward to higher and more efficient sales volumes in 2018; Winning – and beginning to execute – a $13.2 million water treatment contract for the removal of the 1,2,3-TCP contaminant in California. This award exemplifies our ability to leverage the strength of our brand and high-quality solutions while establishing Calgon Carbon as a leader to meet the recent demand surge in the United States for the removal of emerging harmful contaminants from drinking water sources. As a result, our business unit focused on the North American municipal water end market achieved its highest level of annual sales since it was established in 2013; and, Executing a number of actions to improve our profitability and sharpen our focus going forward, including shedding previously idled assets in the UK and implementing business realignment strategies at several facilities globally.\n“In addition, and most notably, we reached an agreement to merge with Kuraray of Japan, and we continue to target completing the merger in the first quarter of 2018. While accelerating value creation for our stockholders, the combination with Kuraray provides Calgon Carbon the opportunity to leverage the resources of a larger, stronger global company, which we expect will enhance our ability to meet the requirements of current and potential customers into the future,” concluded Mr. Dearth.\nPending Calgon Carbon / Kuraray Merger\nOn September 21, 2017, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement under which the Japanese chemical manufacturer Kuraray agreed to acquire the Company, by way of a reverse triangular merger, following the consummation of which the Company would become a wholly owned subsidiary of Kuraray. At the time of the merger, each share of the Company’s common stock will be automatically converted into the right to receive $21.50 in cash.\nOn October 16, 2017 the U.S. Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and on October 25, 2017, clearance was received from the German Federal Cartel Office. On December 28, 2017, the Company’s stockholders voted to approve the merger. Closing the transaction remains subject to other customary closing conditions, as well as approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). On January 19, 2018, at the conclusion of the initial review period, CFIUS notified Calgon Carbon and Kuraray (the parties) that it initiated an additional 45 calendar day investigation period, which will conclude no later than March 5, 2018. The parties continue to target the first quarter of 2018 for the closing of the merger.\nIn light of the pending merger, the Company will not be conducting an investor conference call in conjunction with today’s release of its fourth quarter financial results, and will not be providing financial guidance for future periods.\n1 “Acquisition” refers to the Company’s acquisition of the New Business.\n2 The provisional estimate of the impact of U.S. tax reform recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 is based on the Company's initial analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and may be adjusted in future periods due to, among other things, additional analysis performed by the Company and additional guidance that may be issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\nPure Water.
