    "text": "KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine’s Naftogaz has enough money to pay for gas from European countries in April instead of buying cheaper gas from Russia if a dispute between Ukraine and Russia continues, Naftogaz Chief Commercial Officer Yuri Vitrenko said on Monday.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of the Ukrainian national joint stock company NaftoGaz is seen outside the company's headquarters in central Kiev, Ukraine, March 15, 2016. REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko Speaking at a briefing, Vitrenko also said Naftogaz’s contracts with Russia’s Gazprom were unlikely to be broken before they expire in 2019.\nGazprom said last week it would end contracts with Ukraine after a Stockholm arbitration court ordered it to pay more than $2.5 billion to Naftogaz.\nReporting by Pavel Polityuk; writing by Matthias Williams; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ",
