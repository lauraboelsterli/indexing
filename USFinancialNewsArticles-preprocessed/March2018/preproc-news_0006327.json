    "text": "BERLIN, March 1 (Reuters) - The German government would not oppose a suitable French candidate to replace Tom Enders as chief executive of European planemaker Airbus when his term expires in 2019, German Economics Minister Brigitte Zypries said on Thursday.\nZypries told reporters it would be difficult for Germany, which holds a stake in the company, to block a French candidate after years of having Enders, a German citizen, at the helm.\n“The most important thing is that it is someone who is qualified,” Zypries adding:“The competition in America is not sleeping.”\nEnders announced in December he would not seek a new mandate when his term expires in 2019.
