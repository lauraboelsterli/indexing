Soccer Football - Champions League - Manchester United Training - Aon Training Complex, Manchester, Britain - March 12, 2018 Manchester United's Zlatan Ibrahimovic during training Action Images via Reuters/Jason Cairnduff - RC118255DA20 “Manchester United confirms that it has agreed to the termination of Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s contract with immediate effect,” United said in a statement amid reports that the striker had signed for Los Angeles Galaxy. \"Everyone at the club would like to thank Zlatan for his contribution to the team since his arrival and wishes him well for the future,\" United said on their website. ( www.manutd.com ) The 36-year-old, who is Sweden’s record international goal-scorer with 62 strikes in 116 games, has been linked with a move to the U.S. for some time as he looks to script yet another chapter in his glittering club career. He began his career with his hometown team Malmo in 1999 and played for Ajax, Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona, AC Milan and Paris St Germain before joining United on as a free agent at the start of last season in a reunion with former manager Jose Mourinho. He scored 28 goals in all competitions in his first season for United before sustaining a serious knee injury in April while playing in the Europa League against Belgian side Anderlecht. Despite the injury he was re-signed by United at the end of the season and returned to competitive action in November, making his last appearance for the club on Dec. 26 against Burnley before injury struck again. Galaxy are expected to confirm his signing on Friday. Reporting by Alan Baldwin and Simon Jennings; Editing by Kevin Liffey and Pritha Sarkar",
