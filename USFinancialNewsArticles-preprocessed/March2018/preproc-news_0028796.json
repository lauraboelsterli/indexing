    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Harvest Capital Credit Corporation (NASDAQ: HCAP) (the “Company”) announced today that it will delay filing its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. The Company has filed a Form 12b-25, Notification of Late Filing, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which allows the Company to extend the deadline to file its Form 10-K. A copy of the Company’s Form 12b-25, which, among other things, addresses the reasons for the delayed filing, is available on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov . The Company now plans to report financial results for the fiscal quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, and to hold a conference call to discuss the results, on March 30, 2018. Further information about the conference call will be provided in advance of that date.\nAbout Harvest Capital Credit Corporation\nHarvest Capital Credit Corporation (NASDAQ: HCAP) provides customized financing solutions to privately held small and mid-sized companies in the U.S., generally targeting companies with annual revenues of less than $100 million and annual EBITDA of less than $15 million.
