    "text": "WASHINGTON/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he might travel to Israel for the opening of the U.S. embassy there as he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu presented a united front against Iran in White House talks.\nTrump’s decision for the United States to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move the embassy there from Tel Aviv reversed decades of U.S. policy, aggravated Arab allies and has complicated his administration’s attempt to revive long-stalled Middle East peace talks.\nTrump, with Netanyahu at his side in the Oval Office, said he was considering making what would be his second visit to Jerusalem as president. The opening of the U.S. embassy is planned for May.\n“We’re looking at coming,” Trump said.“If I can, I will.”\nMired in corruption investigations threatening his political survival, Netanyahu - questioned at his home by police on Friday - stepped into a different spotlight during his five-day U.S. visit.\nTrump’s push to change or scrap Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and concerns over Tehran’s foothold in Syria topped the agenda of his talks with Netanyahu, U.S. and Israeli officials said.\nBoth leaders have long railed against the deal, citing its limited duration and the fact it does not cover Iran’s ballistic missile program or its support for anti-Israel militants in the region.\n“If I had to say what is our greatest challenge in the Middle East to both our countries, to our Arab neighbors, it’s encapsulated in one word: Iran,” Netanyahu said.“Iran must be stopped. That is our common challenge.”\nTrump has threatened to pull out of the agreement unless European allies help“fix” it with a follow-up accord. An Israeli official said Netanyahu and Trump were likely to talk about how to overcome European resistance on the matter.\nIsrael has accused Tehran of seeking a permanent military presence in Syria, where Iranian-backed forces support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in a civil war.\nU.S. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump (R) welcome Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (2nd L) and Mrs. Netanyahu (L) at the White House in Washington, U.S., March 5, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque Netanyahu has also cautioned that Israel could act against Iran itself after an Iranian drone flew into Israel last month and an Israeli warplane was shot down while bombing air defenses in Syria. He has accused Iran of planning to build precision-guided missile factories in Lebanon, amid tensions along that border. [L8N1Q809R]\nTrump suggested that the Palestinians are eager to return to negotiations and said if they do not,“you don’t have peace.”\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, angered by Trump’s Jerusalem move, has refused to engage with the United States on Middle East peace, prompting Trump to delay the rollout of peace proposals.\nParticipating in the talks was Trump’s senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has been on the defensive amid investigations into alleged meddling by Russia in the 2016 presidential campaign.\nSlideshow (2 Images) Some analysts believe Kushner’s ability to run the Middle East initiative has been handicapped by his loss of access to certain valued U.S. intelligence because of a White House clampdown on access to such secrets for those without full security clearance.\n‘ROUTINE CHECK-IN’\nNo major announcements or breakthroughs were expected from Trump’s talks with Netanyahu, whose relationship with the president has been among the closest of any other world leader.\nRelated Coverage Security clearance downgrade did not affect Kushner's Mideast role: White House Trump says may visit Israel for embassy opening “This is a routine check-in meeting,” one U.S. official said of Netanyahu’s second visit to the Trump White House.\nFor Netanyahu, however, the Oval Office meeting and address to the pro-Israel lobby group AIPAC on Tuesday offer a respite from his legal troubles.\nNetanyahu awaits a decision by Israel’s attorney general on whether to indict him, as police have recommended in two bribery cases. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing.\nU.S. officials have said the cases are not expected to affect Netanyahu’s talks, which include meetings with members of Congress.\nReporting by Matt Spetalnick and Jeffrey Heller; additional reporting by Ayesha Rascoe, Writing by Steve Holland; Editing by William Maclean and Grant McCool\n ",
