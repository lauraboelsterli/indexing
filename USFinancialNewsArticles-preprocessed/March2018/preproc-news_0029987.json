    "text": "BEIJING, March 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- RYB Education, Inc. (\"RYB\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: RYB), a leading early childhood education service provider in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 201 7 Operational and Financial Summary\nNumber of students enrolled at RYB directly operated kindergartens was 21,684 as of December 31, 2017, compared with 17,900 as of December 31, 2016.

Net revenues were $39.1 million, compared with $32.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross profit was $7.5 million, compared with $2.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of RYB for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.2 million, compared with $0.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders [1] of RYB for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.9 million, compared with $0.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Cash used in operating activities was $15.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $4.8 million of cash generated from operating activities during the fourth quarter of 2016.\n[1] Adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is defined as net income attributable to ordinary shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. See \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP results\" elsewhere in this earnings release.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Summary\nNet revenues were $140.8 million, compared with $108.5 million for 2016. Gross profit was $29.5 million, compared with $16.9 million for 2016. Net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of RYB for 2017 was $7.1 million, compared with $6.5 million for 2016. Adjusted net income attributable to ordinary shareholders of RYB for 2017 was $11.1 million, compared with $6.5 million for 2016.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $39.1 million, from $32.4 million for the same quarter of 2016.\nService revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $34.8 million, from $29.0 million for the same quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of students enrolled at our directly owned kindergartens and increases in training and other service revenues.\nProduct revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to $4.3 million, compared with $3.4 million for the same quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the amount of merchandise sold through the Company's franchise network.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $31.6 million, compared with $30.0 million for the same quarter of 2016. Cost of services revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $29.3 million, compared with $28.2 million for the same quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in staff compensation at the Company's directly operated kindergartens and play-and-learn centers and, to a lesser extent, an increase in compensation to our franchise-service-and-supervision team. Cost of products revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.3 million, compared with $1.8 million for the same quarter of 2016, as the Company sold more products in the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $7.5 million, compared with $2.4 million for the same quarter of 2016.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $7.6 million, compared with $2.5 million for the same quarter of 2016.

Excluding share-based compensation expenses, G&A expenses were $5.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in G&A expense excluding share-based compensation expenses was primarily due to higher cash compensation cost and additional expenses incurred in professional service fees. The share-based-compensation included in G&A expense was $1.6 million for the quarter.\nOperating Income/Loss\nOperating loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.2 million, compared with $0.1 million for the same quarter last year.

The case remains under investigation. The police have published a report rejecting as rumors certain allegations against RYB that had circulated on internet. Nonetheless, in the wake of the Xintiandi incident, the Company has redoubled its efforts to raise quality standards on the security and safety of its facilities and the management of its faculty and staff. The Company has taken steps to implement more stringent teacher recruitment requirements, by, among other things, improving teacher training, raising teacher compensation, and more closely monitoring and providing support to its staff. In addition, the Company has taken measures to improve its security monitoring and management system. The Company has invited parents to participate in open classes and other efforts aiming to make its facilities more safe and transparent. While the aforementioned actions are expected to increase the Company's operating costs in the near term, they are also expected to help set a strong foundation for a stable high-quality teaching team; create a warm, secure and harmonious environment for its students and their parents and enable the Company to continue delivering high-quality education. These efforts are also expected to help build long-term growth prospects and sustain healthy financial performance.\nAbout RYB Education, Inc.\nFounded on the core values of ''Care'' and ''Responsibility,'' RYB Education, Inc. is a leading early childhood education service provider in China.
