    "text": "STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Purdue Pharma L.P. today announced that Lisa C. Miller, Pharm.D. has been appointed to the Head of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), a new position at the company, effective immediately.\n“Corporate social responsibility has become an increased priority for Purdue as we continue to address the opioid crisis through new partnerships and initiatives as well as ongoing strategic alliances. Our commitment to devote even greater resources to this area closely follows our recent decision to discontinue sales representatives’ promotion of opioids to prescribers and speaker programs associated with our opioid products,” said Craig Landau, MD, President and CEO, Purdue Pharma. “Lisa’s long history as a creator of high-impact programs and cultivator of collaborative relationships, as well as her deep personal and professional commitment to serving patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals make her uniquely suited to lead and grow our efforts in this area.”\nIn her new role, Dr. Miller will lead the company’s efforts to formalize and implement a cross functional CSR practice. Building on existing public-private partnerships and collaborations, she will advance Purdue’s ongoing efforts to address the opioid crisis beyond prevention and harm reduction into the areas of treatment and recovery support. She will also manage programs currently underway, including:\nProviding the National Sheriffs’ Association with support to enable front-line officers to use the rescue drug naloxone. Participating in the Prescription Drug Safety Network and supporting efforts to bring prevention education created by EVERFI to high school students across the US. Partnering with the Commonwealth of Virginia to enhance its Prescription Monitoring Program (PMP) to help integrate the use of its data into the regular workflow of doctors and nurses. Supporting Project Lazarus and Safe Kids North Carolina to enhance state-wide medicine disposal activities and conduct systematic research to evaluate the impact of community-based prevention programs on opioid-related overdoses, abuse, and diversion.\nDr. Miller will also spearhead new programs that support the company’s commitment to healthcare professionals and patients. She will oversee ongoing CSR efforts related to conservation, sustainability, and environmental stewardship as well as supporting continued Purdue employee volunteerism and engagement in the communities where they work and live. She will be based in Stamford and will report to Josie Martin, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Affairs & Communications.\nDuring her 17-year career at Purdue, Dr. Miller has held numerous positions in the company. Most recently she served as Executive Director, Risk Management and Mitigation, through which she oversaw creation of Purdue’s Enterprise Risk Management program. She joined Purdue in 2001 and led Healthcare Education and Liaison Programs, overseeing Purdue’s Medical Science Liaisons, Medical Education, and Healthcare Grants and Giving. In 2014, she became Executive Director, Health Care Systems, which included working with Integrated Delivery Networks, Long-term Care, and the Federal Government. Throughout her tenure with the company, Lisa has served on multiple corporate task forces, committees, and strategy groups.\nDr. Miller holds an MBA in Pharmaceutical Business from Mayes College of Healthcare Business and Policy in Philadelphia. She received her Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm.D.) from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, College of Pharmacy in Little Rock, Arkansas. Currently she serves as the co-chair and is on the Board of Directors of Fairfield County Hospice House, Inc. in Stamford, Conn.\nABOUT PURDUE PHARMA L.P.\nPurdue Pharma L.P. is a privately-held pharmaceutical company headquartered in Stamford, Conn.
