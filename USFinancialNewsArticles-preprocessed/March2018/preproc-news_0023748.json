    "text": "LILLE, France (Reuters) - French far-right leader Marine Le Pen proposed her National Front party be renamed the “National Rally” on Sunday, in a bid to shed a brand associated by many voters with racism and anti-Semitism and facilitate alliances with other parties. \n\nMarine Le Pen, National Front (FN) political party leader, arrives to announce the new staff, during National Front's congress in Lille, France, March 11, 2018. REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol “Our goal is clear: power,” Le Pen told party cardholders gathered in the northern city of Lille for a “refoundation” congress. \n\nSlideshow (2 Images) “We were originally a protest party,” she said. “There should be no doubt now that we can be a ruling party.” \nThe idea of changing the party’s name was only approved by a narrow majority of National Front members, with 52 percent backing it on Saturday, according to figures provided by the party. They will get to vote again on the new name by post. \nJean-Marie Le Pen, the 89-year old far-right veteran who founded the party in 1972, called the name change political “suicide” in an interview with Reuters last month. \nReporting by Simon Carraud, writing by Michel Rose, Editing by William Maclean\n ",
