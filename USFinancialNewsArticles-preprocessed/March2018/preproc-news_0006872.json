    "text": "(Corrects second paragraph to show Dragoneer Investment Group LLC is an investment firm, not a venture capital firm)\nSAO PAULO, March 1 (Reuters) - Brazilian financial startup Nubank said on Thursday it raised $150 million in a new financing round led by venture capital firm DST Global Investment Partners, alongside other current investors, such as Founders Fund, Redpoint Ventures, Ribbit Capital LP and QED.\nTwo new firms also joined Nubank in its sixth round, investment firm Dragoneer Investment Group LLC and venture capital firm Thrive Capital Partners Inc. Since its foundation in 2013, Nubank has raised $330 million.\nNubank founder, David Vélez, said in a statement the startup will use the proceeds to leverage its growth. The São Paulo-based startup received regulatory approval to become a bank in January. (Reporting by Alberto Alerigi Jr. and Carolina Mandl; editing by Diane Craft)\n ",
