FILE PHOTO - A boat is seen close to oil installations at Lake Maracaibo in Cabimas, Venezuela October 5, 2017. REUTERS/Isaac Urrutia “We are considering all options, including oil sector sanctions options,” a senior administration official told reporters on a conference call. “We are actively considering what steps we want to take and what the best timing is to maximize the effect of our actions.” The official said oil sanctions would not only have an impact on the government in Caracas, but also ordinary Venezuelans, countries in Central America and the U.S. economy.
