That was up about 3.1 percent from 2016, when average monthly consumption was 6.4 million tonnes.\nDemand for the industrial fuel in Asia’s third-biggest economy is expected to grow between 5 and 8 percent this year, market participants said.\nEying the 2019 elections, Modi is budgeting 14.34 trillion rupees ($221 billion) on rural infrastructure in the 2018/19 business year.\nIndians will also go to the polls in five states by January next year.\n“Bullish factors to look forward to in regards to Indian gasoil (include) solid economic growth with special emphasis towards rural development, improving industrial/freight activities, an uptick in the construction sector and not the least, the upcoming elections,” said Sri Paravaikkarasu, head of East of Suez oil at consultancy FGE.\nMeanwhile, an expected plentiful monsoon would boost agricultural expansion as seasonal rainfall is likely to be unaffected by an El Nino weather pattern forecast to set in after the four-month rainy season ends in September.\n“In the absence of rain, diesel will be used for power generation. However, a good rainfall will mean that diesel will be used a lot more in harvesting,” Vijayakar said.\nIndia guzzled 13.2 million tonnes of diesel in January and February, up 10 percent from a year earlier, recent government data showed.\nMeanwhile India’s diesel exports in February were up 32 percent to 2.31 million tonnes year-on-year.\nElection spending and “the tendency of state-run refiners to refrain from increasing diesel prices during this period, will particularly support the fuel’s demand,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.
