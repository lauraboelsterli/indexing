    "text": "RADNOR, Pa., March 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP announces that a shareholder class action lawsuit has been filed against WageWorks, Inc. (NYSE: WAGE) (\"WageWorks\" or the \"Company\") on behalf of purchasers of the Company's securities between May 6, 2016 and March 1, 2018 , inclusive (the \"Class Period\").\nInvestors who purchased WageWorks securities during the Class Period may, no later than May 8, 2018, seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. For additional information or to learn how to participate in this action please visit: https://www.ktmc.com/new-cases/wageworks-inc#join\nWageWorks investors who wish to discuss this action and their legal options are encouraged to contact Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP (Darren J. Check, Esq., D. Seamus Kaskela, Esq. or Adrienne Bell, Esq.) at (888) 299 - 7706 or at info@ktmc.com .\nWageWorks provides tax-advantaged programs for consumer-directed health, commuter, and other employee spending account benefits in the United States.\nThe shareholder class action complaint alleges that WageWorks and certain of its senior executive officers made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose to investors that: (i) there were material weaknesses in WageWorks' systems of internal controls and that its practices and controls were ineffective; (ii) WageWorks failed to adequately manage and assess risk relating to certain complex transactions, including certain government contracts; (iii) WageWorks improperly recognized revenue thereby inflating its earnings and related financial metrics; and (iv) as a result of the foregoing, WageWorks' financial statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. As a result of the issuance of these false and misleading financial statements, throughout the Class Period the common stock of WageWorks traded at artificially inflated prices.\nOn March 1, 2018, WageWorks disclosed that it was delaying the filing of its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. Following this news, shares of the Company's common stock declined $9.75 per share, or over 18.5%, to close at $42.70, on heavy trading volume.\nThe following day the Company reported that it \"has concluded that it has a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting â€¦ related to managing change and assessing risk in the areas of non-routine and complex transactions.\" Additionally, the Company disclosed that \"[t]he Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors is conducting an independent investigation of the Company's internal control over financial reporting in fiscal 2016 and 2017. Among other matters, the investigation consists of a review of certain issues, including revenue recognition, related to the accounting for a government contract during fiscal 2016 and associated issues with whether there was an open flow of information and appropriate tone at the top for an effective control environment.\"\nWageWorks investors may, no later than May 8, 2018 , seek to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed as a lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member's claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class in the action. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff.\nKessler Topaz Meltzer & Check prosecutes class actions in state and federal courts throughout the country. Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check is a driving force behind corporate governance reform, and has recovered billions of dollars on behalf of institutional and individual investors from the United States and around the world. The firm represents investors, consumers and whistleblowers (private citizens who report fraudulent practices against the government and share in the recovery of government dollars). The complaint in this action was not filed by Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check.
