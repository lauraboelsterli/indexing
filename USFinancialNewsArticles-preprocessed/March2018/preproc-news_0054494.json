    "text": "NEW YORK, March 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Seven Stars Cloud Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: SSC) (\"SSC\" or the \"Company\"), announced today its Full Year 2017 operating results for the period ended December 31, 2017 (a full copy of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K will also be posted at www.sec.gov ).\nConference Call: SSC's management, including Bruno Wu (Executive Chairman & CEO), Robert G. Benya (President, Director & Chief Revenue Officer), Simon Wang (CFO) and Jason Wu (Finance Director), will host an earnings release conference call at 8:00 a.m. on Monday, April 2, U.S. Eastern Time (8:00 p.m. on Monday April 2, Beijing/Hong Kong Time).\nTo join the webcast, please visit the 'Events & Presentations' section of the SSC corporate website ( http://www.sevenstarscloud.com/events ) , or click http://sevenstarscloud.equisolvewebcast.com/q4-2017 or call the toll-free dial-in number:\n877-407-3107; International callers should dial: 201-493-6796.\nSSC FULL YEAR 2017 OPERATING RESULTS\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $144.3 million as compared to $35.2 million for the same period in 2016, an increase of approximately $109.2 million, or 310% (2016 full year revenue was originally recorded as $4.5 million in the 2016 10-K, which when compared to 2017 full year revenue would have presented 2017 vs 2016 revenue growth of 3,106%. In January 2017, the Company completed acquisitions of SVG and Wide Angle, and considering these acquisitions were under common control under our CEO and Chairman Bruno Wu since November 10, 2016, the Company's financials for the year 2016 have been adjusted to reflect ownership by the Company since November 10, 2016, when common control existed in accordance with US GAAP). The increase was mainly due to our new business lines acquired in January 2017, and to a lesser extent, one-time consulting services that we provided to certain customers. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of our legacy YOD business in the amount of $3.8 million, as the legacy YOD business shifts to a new exclusive distribution agreement with Zhejiang Yanhua Culture Media Co., Ltd., or Yanhua, which was announced in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCost of revenues was $137.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $35.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our cost of revenues increased by $101.6 million which is in line with our increase in revenues. Our cost of revenues is primarily comprised of costs to purchase electronic products and crude oil from suppliers in our supply chain business as well as the cost of sales from the Legacy YOD business which is primarily comprised of content licensing fees.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $7.2 million, as compared to a gross loss of $0.4 million during the same period in 2016. Gross profit ratio for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 5.0%, while in 2016, it was negative. The reason for the gross loss in 2016 was due to higher costs associated with the commercial electronic supply chain business as the Company looked to expand its customer base and sales volume. For the year ended December 31, 2017, gross margin for the electronic supply chain business increased to 2.7%, which contributed gross profit in the amount of $3.3 million.\nSelling, general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $12.8 million as compared to $10.9 million for the same period in 2016, an increase of approximately $1.9 million or 18%. The majority of the increase was due to 1) an increase in our sales and marketing expense in the amount of $1.6 million in order to introduce and promote our services to various new potential business partners; 2) an increase of approximately $0.9 million of share based compensation due to option and restricted shares units that the Company approved for grant to independent board members for their 2017 compensation (which included a significant increase in board related work during 2017 compared with prior years; 3) an increase in headcount and relevant traveling expenses in the amount of $1.1 million and 4) leasehold improvement disposal losses of approximately $0.7 million that were incurred when the Company canceled its purchase of our Beijing office building in 2017.\nProfessional fees are generally related to public company reporting and governance expenses as well as legal fees related to business transition and expansion. Our professional fees increased approximately by $1.8 million, or 125%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with the same period in 2016. The increase in professional fees was related to an increase in audit service fees, which increased from $0.6 million in 2016 to $1.2 million in 2017. This increase can be primarily attributed to the non-recurring opening audit fess due to the auditor change as well as increasing legal, financial advisory, valuation and auditing service fees incurred in relation to acquisitions and general corporate business activity in 2017.\nIn 2016, the Company recognized an Earn-Out Share Award expense to Bruno Wu's Sun Seven Stars of approximately $13,700,000, for reaching certain milestones and based on the fair value of common stock issued at the time. In 2017, no such expense was incurred.\nLoss per share for 2017 was $0.16 as compared to loss per share of $0.73 in 2016.\nExecutive Chairman and CEO Bruno Wu stated, \"2017 saw persistent operational improvements throughout the year with our business gaining strength, diversification and stability quarter after quarter. Sales were up substantially as the Company transitioned away from the old and began establishing the foundation for the future. Looking forward, SSC's market opportunities in fintech-powered digital asset securitization are both significant and synergistic. Our ability to innovate and execute as we did in 2017 gives us the confidence to become a leader in the digital finance space, as we foresee customers and partners beginning to recognize our platform innovations and market leadership.
