They, along with other industrial stocks, have taken a beating in the wake of Trump’s tariffs plans due to their exposure to China.\nLast week, the three main U.S. indexes posted their steepest weekly declines since January 2016 as the fears of a global trade war added to jitters about a faster pace of U.S. interest rate hikes and fears of regulations to the high-flying technology sector in the wake of Facebook’s data scandal.\nThe S&P 500 is down 3.2 percent for the year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has slid 4.2 percent. The Nasdaq Composite held on to a 1.3 percent gain.\nMicrosoft rose 3.8 percent premarket on Monday after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock, saying the company could hit $1 trillion in market value with growing public adoption of the cloud and improving margins.\nIntel gained more than 2 percent after brokerage Raymond James upgraded the stock to “market perform”.
