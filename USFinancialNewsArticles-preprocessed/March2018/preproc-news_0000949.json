    "text": "HONG KONG, March 2 (Reuters) - GOME Retail Holdings Ltd said it expected to swing to a loss of up to 500 million yuan ($78.7 million) in 2017 due to impairment of goodwill for under-performing business, and impairment of long-term assets relating to e-commerce.\nHigher debt costs also would contribute to the estimated loss of 300 million yuan to 500 million yuan for the year, the home appliances retailer said in a filing to the Hong Kong bourse late on Thursday.\nExcluding impairments and interest on bonds payable, GOME said it expected 2017 profit to improve.\n“During the reporting period, the overall operating performance of the group remained strong,” Chairman Zhang Da Zhong said in the statement.\nTotal gross merchandise volume for online and offline operations was expected to grow more than 20 percent, the $2.6 billion company said.\nComparable stores sales were set to rise more than 2 percent and consolidated gross profit margin was seen exceeding 18 percent.\nGOME posted a 325 million yuan profit in 2016 with consolidated gross profit margin at 16.09 percent. The company is due to announce its yearly results by the end of March.\nBigger rival Suning.Com Co Ltd said its 2017 sales surged 30 percent year-on-year to 243.2 billion yuan, with profit up nearly 500 percent to 4.21 billion yuan amid rapid growth in revenue scale and net profit margin both online and offline.
