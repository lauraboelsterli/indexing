RBC Capital Markets analyzed whether it made sense for Buffett to invest in GE at these levels. General Electric's stock rose 4.3% Tuesday amid unsubstantiated speculation that the Oracle of Omaha was buying shares of the beleaguered industrial conglomerate. The company's shares have significantly underperformed the market. Its stock has declined 55 percent in the past 12 months through Tuesday versus the S&P 500's 11% return. \"Berkshire Hathaway has a history of investing in storied businesses struggling at steep valuation dislocations. In many ways, GE's current situation fits the profile of an ideal Warren Buffett investment,\" analyst Deane Dray wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. \"GE is a 125-year-old iconic industrial brand with strong assets, market leadership in many industries, and a business model that Mr. Buffett understands.\"",
