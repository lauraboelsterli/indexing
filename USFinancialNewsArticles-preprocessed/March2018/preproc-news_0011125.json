    "text": "(For a live blog, type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window)\nMILAN, March 2 (Reuters) - European shares fell to new two-week lows on Friday after Donald Trump said the United States would impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminium, prompting worries over a global trade war.\nSuch concerns sparked a broad sell off in Europe, sending the pan-regional STOXX 600 index down 0.7 percent by 0825 GMT. Germany’s DAX fell 1.1 percent and Britain’s FTSE dropped 0.3 percent.\nAll sectors were trading in negative territory, with autos leading the drop and weighed down by a 3.7 percent slump in Fiat Chrysler shares on concerns that the U.S. tariff move could increase raw material costs.\nSteel and aluminium stocks were also generally lower with ArcelorMittal, Salzgitter and Norsk Hydro all down around 2 percent. Steel pipes maker Tenaris , which has production and marketing facilities in the United States, however, rose around 0.6 percent.\nPrecious metal miners outperformed as investors sought refuge in safe-haves assets such as gold following Trump’s announcement. Randgold, Centamin and Polymetal all rose more than 1.7 percent.\nSwedish radiation therapy equipment maker Elekta, up 9.9 percent, led gainers on the STOXX after it reported above-forecast earnings, while IMI dropped 7.5 percent as its trading update disappointed.\nThe STOXX was on track to end the week, already marked by worries over faster rate hikes in the United States, down more than 2 percent.
