The top U.S. telecommunications regulator said in a letter to lawmakers that he shares their concerns about the “security threat that Huawei and other Chinese technology companies pose to our communications networks.” Earlier this week Best Buy Co Inc, the largest U.S. consumer electronics retailer, decided to cut ties with China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd , Reuters reported, amid heightened scrutiny on Chinese tech firms in the United States.
