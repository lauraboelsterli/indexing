Whitestone is a community-centered retail REIT that acquires, owns, manages, develops and redevelops high quality “Ecommerce-resistant” neighborhood, community and lifestyle retail centers principally located in the largest, fastest-growing and most affluent markets in the Sunbelt. Whitestone’s mix of national, regional and local tenants provide daily necessities, needed services and entertainment not typically readily available online to their respective communities.\nHighlights\nAll per share amounts presented are on a diluted per common share and operating partnership (“OP”) unit basis unless stated otherwise.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2016:\n19.3% growth in revenues to $33.8 million Net income attributable to Whitestone REIT of $1.9 million and $0.05 per share compared to $0.5 million and $0.01 per share 19.0% increase in net operating income (“NOI”) to $22.3 million Same store NOI growth in wholly owned portfolio of 0.1%, 2.2% when adjusting for retenanting and non-recoverable property marketing expenses. Same store NOI growth including consolidated partnership properties of (0.2%), 1.7% when adjusting for retenanting and non-recoverable property marketing expenses 46.7% improvement in Funds from Operations (“FFO”) to $9.1 million and 10% on a per share basis to $0.22 14.3% increase in FFO Core to $12.2 million or $0.30 per share compared to $10.6 million or $0.34 per share\nFull Year 2017 Compared to Full Year 2016:\n20.6% growth in revenues to $126.0 million Net income attributable to Whitestone REIT of $8.3 million and $0.22 per share compared to $7.9 million and $0.26 per share 19.2% growth in NOI to $83.8 million Same store NOI growth in wholly owned portfolio up 2.6% and 1.4% including consolidated partnership properties 29.6% increase in FFO to $35.0 million or 2.2% on a per share basis to $0.93 19.6% growth in FFO Core to $47.1 million or $1.25 per share compared to $39.4 million or $1.34 per share Total occupancy, including operating properties, development properties and consolidated partnership properties, of 88.0%, up 120 basis points 7.0% increase in rental rates on new and renewal leases on a GAAP basis\n“2017 marked another year of strong performance,\" commented James C. Mastandrea, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Whitestone REIT. \"While fourth quarter and full year same property NOI growth was slower than previous periods, due primarily to retenanting and non-recoverable property marketing costs, we expect that the expenditures will result in stronger NOI growth in 2018. We believe that our high-quality properties, simple and transparent capital structure, well-aligned business model and efficient infrastructure will allow us to continue to expand profitably. While there will be variability quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, our proven approach allows us to maximize property income, deliver predictable dividends, provide inflation protection from rising interest rates, and ultimately continue to drive long-term shareholder value.\"\nReal Estate Portfolio Update\nCommunity Centered Properties™ Portfolio Statistics:\nAs of December 31, 2017, Whitestone wholly owned 59 Community Centered Properties ® with 5.0 million square feet of gross leasable area (\"GLA\"). Whitestone’s retail Community Centered Properties ® are located in Austin (4), San Antonio (3), Chicago (1), Dallas-Fort Worth (7), Houston (17) and the greater Phoenix metropolitan area (27). In addition to being business friendly, the Texas and Arizona markets are among the top in the country in terms of size, economic strength and population growth. Between 2017 and 2022, all of these cities are expected to experience significant population growth, led by Austin at +9.7%, San Antonio at +8.6%, Dallas-Fort Worth at +9.7%, Houston at 8.0% and Phoenix at +6.6% (1) . We believe that the Company’s retail properties in these markets are located on the best retail corners embedded in affluent communities. The Company also owns a majority interest in and manages 14 properties containing 1.5 million square feet of GLA through its investment in Pillarstone Capital REIT Operating Partnership, L.P.\nAt the end of the fourth quarter, the Company's diversified tenant base in our wholly-owned properties was comprised of 1,266 tenants, with the largest tenant accounting for only 2.9% of annualized base rental revenues. Lease terms range from less than one year for smaller tenants to over 15 years for larger tenants. The leases generally include minimum monthly lease payments and tenant reimbursements for payment of taxes, insurance and maintenance, and typically exclude restrictive lease clauses.\nLeasing Activity:\nDuring the fourth quarter, the leasing team signed 94 leases totaling 264,085 square feet in new, expansion and renewal leases, compared to 98 leases totaling 257,395 square feet in the fourth quarter of 2016. The total lease value added during the quarter was $14.8 million compared to $20.0 million during the same period last year. For the full year, total lease value added was $71.2 million compared to $77.0 million in 2016.\nThe Company's total operating portfolio occupancy, excluding development and non wholly-owned properties, was 90.5% at year-end.\nAcquisition Activity in 2017:\nEldorado Plaza\nOn May 3, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of Eldorado Plaza, located in McKinney, Texas, for $46.6 million. Eldorado Plaza is located on the north end of the Dallas “Platinum Corridor.” This Class-A lifestyle center contains 221,577 square feet of leasable space. As of December 31, 2017, Eldorado Plaza was 96% leased.\nBLVD Place\nOn May 26, 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of BLVD Place, a Class-A retail center located in the affluent and fast-growing Uptown community of Houston, Texas, one of the largest business districts in the United States, for a purchase price of $158.0 million. This Class-A lifestyle center, includes 216,944 square feet of leasable space and approximately 1.43 acres of developable land. As of December 31, 2017, BLVD Place was 100% leased.\nDisposition Activity:\nOn February 27, 2018, we completed the sale of Bellnott Square, located in Houston, Texas, for $4.7 million. This disposition was pursuant to our strategy of recycling capital by disposing of Non-Core Properties, primarily properties that we owned at the time our current management team assumed the management of the Company, that do not fit our Community Centered Property strategy. We expect to record a gain on sale of approximately $0.3 million in 2018.\nDevelopment Activity in 2017:\nDuring 2017, the Company invested $17.6 million of capital improvements in its portfolio, including development of Pinnacle of Scottsdale Phase II, a 27,063 square foot Community Centered Property ® located in Scottsdale, Arizona and Shops at Starwood Phase III, a 35,351 square foot Community Centered Property ® located in Frisco, Texas. Pinnacle of Scottsdale Phase II and Shop at Starwood Phase III were 91% and 71% occupied, respectively, at year-end.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nBalance Sheet:\nReflecting the Company’s acquisition and disposition activity during the year and selective development and redevelopment, undepreciated real estate assets increased $229.1 million, or 24.9%, to $1.149 billion at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity, Debt and Credit Facility:\nAt December 31, 2017, 49 of the Company’s wholly-owned 59 properties were unencumbered by mortgage debt, with an undepreciated cost basis of $735.7 million. At December 31, 2017 the Company had total real estate debt of $659.1 million, of which $426.9 million, or approximately 65%, was subject to fixed interest rates. The Company's weighted average interest rate on all fixed rate debt as of the end of the fourth quarter was 3.9% and the weighted average remaining term was 5.3 years.\nAt quarter end, Whitestone had $7.8 million of cash available on its balance sheet and $67.8 million of available capacity under its credit facility, before the $200 million accordion option.\nDividend\nOn December 14, 2017, the Company declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.285 per common share and OP unit for the first quarter of 2018, to be paid in three equal installments of $0.095 in January, February and March of 2018.\n2018 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE\n(all amounts in thousands, except shares, per share numbers and percentages)\nProjected Range Actual Full Year 2018 2017 Low High Net income attributable to Whitestone REIT per common share and OP unit - diluted $ 0.22 $ 0.27 $ 0.32 FFO per common share and OP unit - diluted $ 0.93 $ 0.96 $ 1.01 FFO Core per common share and OP unit - diluted $ 1.25 $ 1.19 $ 1.24 Operating Assumptions Same Store NOI growth - wholly owned properties 2.6 % 2.5 % 3.7 % Same Store NOI growth - Consolidated Partnership (6.6 )% (2.0 )% 2.0 % Same Store NOI growth - all properties 1.4 % 2.0 % 3.5 % Ending occupancy - wholly owned properties 90.2 % 90.5 % 91.5 % Ending occupancy - Consolidated Partnership 80.5 % 80.5 % 81.5 % Ending occupancy - all properties 88.0 % 88.2 % 89.2 % General and administrative expense (excluding acq cost) as % of total property revenue 17.7 % 16.3 % 15.5 % Net debt to adjusted EBITDA - Year End 8.56 X 8.40 X 8.20 X Average interest rate on all debt 3.8 % 4.1 % 4.1 % Weighted average shares and OP units 37,343 41,672 41,672 The following table outlines the key factors impacting 2018 FFO and FFO Core ranges, and accounts for the difference from the Company's 2017 reported FFO and FFO Core:\nFFO FFO Core Low High Low High Actual - 2017 $ 0.93 $ 0.93 $ 1.25 $ 1.25 2017 Transactional activity (acquisition costs) 0.02 0.02 — — Same Store NOI Growth 0.03 0.06 0.03 0.06 Interest rate increase (0.03 ) (0.03 ) (0.03 ) (0.03 ) Non-cash share based compensation 0.07 0.07 — — Cash compensation (0.06 ) (0.04 ) (0.06 ) (0.04 ) Guidance - 2018 $ 0.96 $ 1.01 $ 1.19 $ 1.24 This guidance reflects management’s view of current and future market conditions, as well as the earnings impact of events referenced elsewhere in this release and during the Company’s conference call.

The Company intends for all such to be covered by the safe-harbor provisions for contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, as applicable. Such information is subject to certain risks and uncertainties, as well as known and unknown risks, which could cause actual results to projected or anticipated. Therefore, such statements are not intended to be a guarantee of our performance in future periods. Such can generally be identified by the Company's use of forward-looking terminology, such as “may,” “will,” “plan,” “expect,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “continue,” “goals” or similar words or phrases that are predictions of future events or trends and which do not relate solely to historical matters.\nThe following are some of the factors that could cause the Company's actual results and its expectations to described in the Company's : the Company's ability to meet its long-term goals, its assumptions regarding its earnings guidance, including its ability to execute effectively its acquisition and disposition strategy, to continue to execute its development pipeline on schedule and at the expected costs, and its ability to grow its NOI as expected, which could be impacted by a number of factors, including, among other things, its ability to continue to renew leases or re-let space on attractive terms and to otherwise address its leasing rollover; its ability to successfully identify, finance and consummate suitable acquisitions, and the impact of such acquisitions, including financing developments, capitalization rates and internal rate of return; the Company’s ability to reduce or otherwise effectively manage its general and administrative expenses, including in connection with the recent proposed nomination of trustees by a shareholder of the Company; the Company’s ability to fund from cash flows or otherwise distributions to its shareholders at current rates or at all; current adverse market and economic conditions; lease terminations or lease defaults; the impact of competition on the Company's efforts to renew existing leases; changes in the economies and other conditions of the specific markets in which the Company operates; economic, legislative and regulatory changes, including the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017; the success of the Company's real estate strategies and investment objectives; the Company's ability to continue to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and other factors detailed in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other documents the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time.\nReaders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these , which speak only as of the date of this press release. The Company cannot guarantee the accuracy of any such contained in this press release, and the Company does not intend to publicly update or revise any , whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis release contains supplemental financial measures that are not calculated pursuant to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) including FFO, FFO Core, and NOI. Following are explanations and reconciliations of these metrics to their most comparable GAAP metric.\nFFO: Management believes that FFO is a useful measure of the Company's operating performance. The Company computes FFO as defined by NAREIT, which states that FFO should represent net income available to common shareholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses from sales of operating assets, impairment charges and extraordinary items, plus depreciation and amortization of operating properties, including the Company's share of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships. FFO does not represent cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company's performance or to cash flow from operations as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions and service debt.\nManagement considers FFO a useful additional measure of performance for an equity REIT because it facilitates an understanding of the operating performance of its properties without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, management believes that FFO provides a more meaningful and accurate indication of the Company's performance and useful information for the investment community to compare Whitestone to other REITs since FFO is generally recognized as the industry standard for reporting the operations of REITs.\nOther REITs may use different methodologies for calculating FFO, and accordingly, the Company's FFO may not be comparable to other REITs. The Company presents FFO per diluted share calculations that are based on the outstanding dilutive common shares plus the outstanding OP units for the periods presented.\nFFO Core: Management believes that the computation of FFO in accordance with NAREIT's definition includes certain non-cash and non-comparable items that affect the Company's period-over-period performance. These items include, but are not limited to, legal settlements, non-cash share-based compensation expense, rent support agreement payments received from sellers on acquired assets and acquisition costs. In addition, the Company believes that FFO Core is a useful supplemental measure for the investing community to use in comparing the Company to other REITs as many REITs provide some form of adjusted or modified FFO. However, other REITs may use different adjustments, and the Company's FFO Core may not be comparable to the adjusted or modified FFO of other REITs.\nNOI: Management believes that NOI is a useful measure of the Company's property operating performance. The Company defines NOI as operating revenues (rental and other revenues) less property and related expenses (property operation and maintenance and real estate taxes). Because NOI excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, involuntary conversion, interest expense, interest income, provision for income taxes, gain or loss on sale or disposition of assets and capital expenditures and leasing costs, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating commercial real estate properties and the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income. The Company uses NOI to evaluate its operating performance since NOI allows the Company to evaluate the impact of factors, such as occupancy levels, lease structure, lease rates and tenant base, have on the Company's results, margins and returns. In addition, management believes that NOI provides useful information to the investment community about the Company's property and operating performance when compared to other REITs since NOI is generally recognized as a standard measure of property performance in the real estate industry. However, NOI should not be viewed as a measure of the Company's overall financial performance since it does not reflect general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, involuntary conversion, interest expense, interest income, provision for income taxes, gain or loss on sale or disposition of assets, and the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of the Company's properties. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, the Company's NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs.\n(1) Source: Claritas, April 2017\n(2) Whitestone REIT's total shareholder return as compared to its peers according to the SNL Public REIT Market Data based on closing prices on February 28, 2018.
