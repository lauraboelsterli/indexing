    "text": "March 17, 2018 / 8:31 PM / Updated 13 hours ago Rugby-Stockdale sets record with seventh championship try Mitch Phillips 2 Min Read LONDON, March 17 (Reuters) - Ireland winger Jacob Stockdale set a Six Nations record on Saturday when he touched down his seventh try of the championship in his team’s grand-slam clinching 24-15 victory over England at Twickenham. The 21-year-old benefited from a TMO ruling that he hand knocked the ball forward with his knee rather than his hand as he chased and dived on the ball for Ireland’s key third try just before halftime. His tally of seven took him ahead of England duo Will Greenwood and Chris Ashton and Welshman Shane Williams and took his overall international tally to a remarkable 11 in nine games. Stockdale had already become the first man for more than 100 years to score multiple tries in three consecutive matches after doubles against Italy, Wales and Scotland. However, he fell one short of the all-time championship record of eight, set by England’s Cyril Lowe in the then-Five Nations of 1914, and matched by Ian Smith in 1925, when the Scot twice scored four in a match. “Jacob is still a kid,” Ireland coach Joe Schmidt said. “He’s done incredibly well and people take it for granted but he hasn’t had that much rugby at this level or even at provincial level.” Reporting by Mitch Phillips, editing by Ed Osmond",
