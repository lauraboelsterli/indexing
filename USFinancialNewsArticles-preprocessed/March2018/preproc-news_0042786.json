    "text": "NEW YORK, March 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- WeissLaw LLP is investigating possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law by the Board of Directors of The Finish Line, Inc. (\"FINL\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: FINL) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by Britain's JD Sports Fashion Plc (\"JD\"). Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company's shareholders will receive $13.50 in cash for each FINL share they own.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether FINL's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, at least one analyst set a target price of $15.00 per share, or $1.50 above the offer price. Additionally, FINL shares traded for $13.83 as recently as January, peaking in May of last year when they traded for $16.38, or nearly $3.00 above the offer price.\nFinally, according to its Executive Chairman, the deal offers JD immediate presence in the United States, increases its global footprint, and \"represents an excellent opportunity for JD to establish its market leading multi-brand proposition in the world's largest athleisure market.\"\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether FINL's Board acted in the best interests of FINL's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. If you own FINL shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties.
