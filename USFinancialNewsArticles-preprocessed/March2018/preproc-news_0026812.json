    "text": "March 14, 2018 / 9:17 PM / Updated 27 minutes ago Wells Fargo CEO Sloan's pay rose 35 percent in 2017 to $17.6 million Reuters Staff 1 Min Read (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) Chief Executive Officer Tim Sloan's total compensation for 2017 was $17.6 million, about 35 percent higher than the previous year, the third largest U.S. bank said in a regulatory filing bit.ly/2pcD4QI on Wednesday. FILE PHOTO - Wells Fargo & Company CEO and President Tim Sloan testifies before the Senate Banking Committee on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., October 3, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein Sloan was named to Wells Fargo’s top job in October 2016 after former CEO John Stumpf was forced to resign in the aftermath of a high-profile sales scandal that has hurt the bank’s reputation and hampered its cost-cutting efforts. Sloan said in January that Wells Fargo was not certain it had fully uncovered and fixed all problems related to the scandal, in which bank employees opened as many as 3.5 million phoney accounts. Some $15 million of Sloan’s 2017 pay consists of stock awards. Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry’s compensation for 2017 was $11.9 million, compared with $9.3 million in the previous year.
