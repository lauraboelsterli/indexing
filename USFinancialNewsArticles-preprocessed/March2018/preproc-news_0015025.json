    "text": "March 1, 2018 / 9:08 AM / Updated 40 minutes ago Palestinian migrant gets life sentence for supermarket stabbing in Germany Reuters Staff 1 Min Read BERLIN (Reuters) - A Palestinian asylum seeker and radicalised Islamist who killed one person and injured six others in a knife attack in a Hamburg supermarket in July has been sentenced to life in prison, a spokesman for a city court said on Thursday. Hamburg residents threw chairs and other objects at the attacker - who had been known to authorities - helping police to detain him, but a 50-year-old man died of his injuries. The asylum seeker could not be deported as he lacked identification documents and was psychologically unstable, Hamburgâ€™s Interior Minister Andy Grote said after the attack. Grote also said he had been registered in intelligence systems as an Islamist but not a violent one as there was no evidence to link him to an imminent attack. Germany has been on high alert ever since December 2016, when a Tunisian failed asylum seeker killed 12 people by driving a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin.
