    "text": "0 COMMENTS Utility company NextEra Energy Inc. NEE 0.65% is expanding a deal to buy millions of solar panels from a Chinese manufacturer building a new Florida plant, a move that comes after the U.S. announced tariffs on imported solar products.\nNextEra Energy, parent of Florida Power & Light, said Friday that it would obtain 2.75 gigawatts of solar modules, roughly 7 million solar panels, over four years from Shanghai-based JinkoSolar JKS 4.29% Holding Co., which is opening its first U.S. factory in Florida to meet the demand.\nIn January, the Trump administration announced tariffs—30% in the first year, declining to 15% by the fourth—on foreign-made solar panels and cells. While the tariffs could raise the price of panels overall, technological improvements and cost savings in other areas are expected to help companies continue buying them. Local and state policies requiring utilities to procure renewable energy is also bolstering demand.\nDomestic solar installers, which employ many more people than the relatively small U.S. solar manufacturing sector, have largely opposed the tariffs.\nSolar-panel manufacturer JinkoSolar on Friday confirmed that it is opening its first U.S. factory in Jacksonville, Fla., which is expected to create 200 direct jobs. In January, the company said it had reached a deal to supply a then-unnamed U.S. company with 1.75 gigawatts of solar modules over about three years. \nOnce fully operational JinkoSolar’s factory is expected to have the capacity to build 400 megawatts, or more than 1 million solar modules annually. It is unclear if all 7 million of NextEra panels will be supplied from the U.S.\nTo prepare for the tariffs, NextEra and other solar-project developers have also been stockpiling panels. NextEra Chief Executive James Robo told analysts in January that his company already has purchased all the panels its needs to build in 2018 and 2019, as well as the panels for “a significant portion of our 2020 build.”\nWrite to Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com",
