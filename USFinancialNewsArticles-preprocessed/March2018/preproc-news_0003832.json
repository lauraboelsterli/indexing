    "text": "MOSCOW, Feb 28 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday that Russia had managed to evacuate “quite a big group” of civilians from Syria’s rebel-held eastern Ghouta.\nPutin, speaking at a news conference alongside Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, said Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan had helped broker the evacuation.\nPutin did not say when the civilians had managed to leave.\nHe told the same news conference that rebel groups in eastern Ghouta were using it as a base to shell other areas.
