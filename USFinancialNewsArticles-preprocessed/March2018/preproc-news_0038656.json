    "text": "MONTRÉAL, March 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- New Look Vision Group Inc. ( \"New Look Vision \" or the ‘ Company ’) (TSX:BCI), a leader in the Canadian optical business with 379 stores across Canada, reported financial results today for the 13 and 52 weeks ended December 30, 2017 (“Q4 2017” and “fiscal 2017”). This press release should be read in conjunction with the Company’s management discussion and analysis (the “MD&A\") and consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2017, which are available on the Company’s website at www.newlookvision.ca/investors and have been posted on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nQ4 2017 Financial and Operational Highlights\nRevenues reached $67.5 million and adjusted EBITDA (1) reached $12.5 million for Q4 2017, representing increases of 23.9% and 28.3% respectively over last year. The revenue increase was mainly due to the net addition of 159 stores to the network in the last twelve months as well as same store sales growth of 2.8% over last year. This revenue growth, along with improvement in the materials consumed ratio, resulted in the strong adjusted EBITDA performance. As a percentage of revenues, adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter increased 70 basis points to 18.6%. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased as a result of the acquisition of IRIS and capital investments made on the Company’s stores and laboratories. Adjusted net earnings attributed to shareholders (1) (defined as net earnings adjusted to remove the impact of depreciation, acquisition-related costs, equity-based compensation, and other non-comparable costs) for the fourth quarter increased by $0.7 million to $7.3 million. Adjusted net earnings per share for the quarter compared to Q4 2016 increased 2.19% to $0.48 per share (2) . The increase is mainly due to higher EBITDA offset by higher financial expenses, and taxes. Net earnings attributed to shareholders were $2.8 million, compared to $3.2 million last year, the decrease being mainly due to higher depreciation, financial expenses, taxes and acquisition-related costs, partially offset by lower equity-based compensation, which offset higher EBITDA. Cash flows from operating activities before income taxes paid and changes in working capital items (1) were $11.4 million or $0.75 per share (2) in the fourth quarter of 2017, up significantly from $9.2 million or $0.67 per share last year. Income tax instalments paid in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $1.2 million compared to $1.6 million for 2016. When adjusted for acquisition-related costs and other non-comparable costs, adjusted cash flows from operating activities (1) were $12.2 million or $0.80 per share (2) , an increase of $2.4 million, or 25.1% over last year. On October 24, 2017, the Company acquired Iris The Visual Group (Iris), with 147 stores. Results of this acquisition, for 10 weeks, are included in the results for the fourth quarter and year end for Fiscal 2017.\nYear-to-date Financial and Operating Results\nYear-to-date revenues and adjusted EBITDA reached a record of $229.2 million and $42.1 million respectively, which represent increases of 15.4% and 19.1% respectively over fiscal 2016. Adjusted net earnings attributed to shareholders (1) , which is net earnings adjusted to remove the impact of depreciation, acquisition-related costs, equity-based compensation, and other non-comparable costs were $25.4 million, or $3.0 million over last year. Adjusted net earnings per share (diluted) increased to $1.78, up 9.9% from $1.62 in 2016. Comparable store sales year-to-date were up 2.6% over last year. Net earnings attributed to shareholders were $10.1 million ($0.71 per share) (2) compared to $11.2 million last year ($0.81 per share). Cash flow from operating activities before income taxes paid and changes in working capital were $37.5 million or $2.63 per share (2) in the year-to-date period compared to $33.4 million or $2.41 per share last year, the increase being mainly attributable to increased EBITDA. Adjusted cash flows from operating activities were $41.5 million or $2.91 per share (2) , an increase of $6.4 million, or 18.4% over last year.\nPresident & CEO's comments\nAntoine Amiel, the President and CEO of New Look Vision, stated that: \" With the Q4 results, the 2017 year ended on a very strong note for the group. This and other positive operating and financial factors throughout the year as a whole are concrete evidence of the success of our strategic growth plan in recent years, both organically and by acquisition, as well as our ability to generate synergies across our expanding network.\nIn the fourth quarter, we completed the acquisition of Iris with its 147 locations which gives us a strong optometric based platform to build from in this sector of the consolidating Canadian retail optical industry. We look forward to working with their management team, partners and franchisees in the coming years.\nSubsequent to quarter end, we welcomed on board Tania M. Clarke, as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\"\nDividend Approval\nPursuant to its previously announced dividend policy, the Board of Directors of New Look Vision declared a dividend of $0.15 per common share.
