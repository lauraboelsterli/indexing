In the last few weeks, we opened the Financial Growth Center, which offers essential financial tools and knowledge, free of charge, to customers of all banks.\nAs Israel's leading financial institution, we are determined to undertake a leading role in the growth of the economy and of society; to continue to implement our strategic plan, which will enable us to cope successfully with the challenges of the future and live up to our commitment to present excellent business results; and to act transparently and fairly, demonstrating social responsibility.\"\nKey developments in the financial statements for the full year 2017:\nProfit from regular financing activity totaled NIS 9,010 million in 2017 compared with NIS 8,574 million in 2016, an increase of 5.1%.
