    "text": "281 COMMENTS Tesla Inc. TSLA 3.24% is voluntarily recalling about 123,000 Model S sedans globally after discovering that certain corroding bolts in cold weather climates could lead to a power-steering failure.\nThe Silicon Valley auto maker on Thursday said the recall, believed to be the company’s largest ever, applies to Model S sedans built before April 2016. Tesla said the issue is known to have involved less than 0.02% of the potentially affected vehicles in the U.S.\nTesla has sold about 280,000 total vehicles through the end of last year.\n“There have been no injuries or accidents due to this component, despite accumulating more than a billion miles of driving,” according to an email being sent to customers by Tesla.\nThe recall to retrofit the power steering component adds to the string of challenges Chief Executive Elon Musk is dealing with as he tries to boost production of the Tesla’s mass-market Model 3 sedan and conserve the company’s cash supply.\nMoody’s Investors Service this week downgraded Tesla’s credit rating , concerned that the company won’t meet its first-quarter goal of making 2,500 Model 3s a week. The milestone is important because further delays could crimp Tesla’s cash and threaten to derail Tesla’s bid to build electric cars for the masses.\nThe downgrade, along with news this week that federal investigators were probing a fatal crash of a Tesla car, have led to a heavy selloff of the company’s shares and bonds, making it potentially more difficult to raise capital. \nOn Thursday, Tesla’s stock rose 3.2%, to $266.13, during the regular trading session, and fell slightly in after-hours trading following the recall news. It has been a rough month for the stock, which has fallen about 20% over the 30-day period.\nTesla is expected to reveal first-quarter production results early next week.\nThe recall on Thursday only involves the Model S. Tesla said its service center in Montreal began noticing the issue in Model S sedans and attributed the corrosion to the calcium or magnesium salts used to treat roadways during the winter months. If the bolts fail, the car can still be steered but requires additional force.\n“This primarily makes the car harder to drive at low speeds and for parallel parking, but does not materially affect control at high speed, where only small steering wheel force is needed,” the company said.\nThe cost of the recall is expected to be minimal, Tesla said, with the supplier paying for the new part.\nWrite to Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com \nAppeared in the March 30, 2018, print edition as 'Tesla Issues Recall For 123,000 Sedans.'",
