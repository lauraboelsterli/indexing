    "text": "Company Posts GAAP Operating Profit Ahead of Plan and Positive Cash Flow from Operations, Meets Guidance, and Reports Continuing Progress on Customers, New 5G and Industrial IoT Products, and Operations\nSAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Inseego Corp. (Nasdaq: INSG) (the “Company”), an industry leader in solutions for intelligent mobile enterprises, today reported the following results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. The Company reports fourth quarter revenues of $46.5 million, GAAP operating profit of $0.8 million, GAAP net loss of $3.8 million, or a net loss of $0.06 per share, adjusted EBITDA of $2.8 million and non-GAAP net loss of $0.02 per share. Non-GAAP operating expenses have been reduced by over $30 million on an annualized basis since the first quarter of 2017. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period, including restricted cash, was $21.3 million.\nOn a full year basis, 2017 revenues were $219.3 million and GAAP net loss was $45.7 million, or a net loss of $0.78 per share. This compares to 2016 revenues of $243.6 million and GAAP net loss of $60.6 million, or a net loss of $1.12 per share. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2016 was $9.9 million.\n“We made solid progress in the fourth quarter with major customer wins, new strategic partners and the launch of 5G product development. We generated a GAAP operating profit for the first time since 2009, which is well ahead of plan, and positive cash flow from operations. There’s more work to be done, but the results speak volumes about the new management team’s continued focus on operating efficiency,” said Dan Mondor, CEO of Inseego. “The IoT & Mobile Solutions business is well positioned at the forefront of the 5G revolution and Industrial IoT growth curve. Recent wins in the Aviation vertical combined with a growing pipeline in the U.S. and international markets are very promising for our Enterprise SaaS Solutions business. The transformation of our Company into Inseego 2.0 is on track and the prospects are very bright.”\nRecent Business Highlights\n- Continued progress in developing a complete 5G NR (new radio) portfolio of broadband routers, mobile broadband devices and next generation Industrial IoT devices.\n- Selected by a tier 1 service provider for 5G commercial launch in 2018.\n- Achieved 70% year-over-year revenue growth in our Industrial IoT portfolio (Skyus) and added new enterprise customers.\n- Announced availability of 4G VoLTE HD quality wireless home phone solution and received first purchase orders from a tier 1 wireline service provider to start deployment in the second quarter.\n- Announced a strategic partnership with Sprint for IoT asset management and monitoring and selected by a large U.S. airline through that partnership.\n- Ctrack was selected by KLM Enterprises for Hong Kong airport asset management and monitoring and continued to make progress with proof of concept trials in the Aviation vertical in the U.S., Europe and Asia Pacific.\n- Broadened the MiFi mobile product customer base in the U.S., Canada and Asia Pacific.\n- Announced Inseego 2.0, integrating the Company into IoT & Mobile and Enterprise SaaS Solutions businesses and global shared services to drive cost efficiencies and focus product development, sales and marketing on high growth markets.\n- Announced the addition of Mark Licht to the board of directors, bringing extensive experience in the global telematics markets to the Company.\n“Restructuring is a tough, inexact science,” said Steve Smith, CFO of Inseego. “It involves focusing on the issues in front of us, while at the same time seeing the long term and planning for future growth. Achieving positive operating income and positive cash flow from operations for the quarter is a key milestone for the Company. Regarding the outlook for Q1 2018, we are planning to drive adjusted EBITDA growth despite minimal near-term projected growth in the current MiFi products. Growth in the IoT & Mobile Solutions business will be predicated on the new product developments in 5G and Industrial IoT currently in the pipeline, which does not happen overnight. Enterprise SaaS Solutions is positioned for near-term growth driven by Aviation.”\nFirst Quarter Outlook\nThe following statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially.

In this context, often address expected future business and financial performance and often contain words such as “may,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” “will” and similar words and phrases indicating future results. The information presented in this news release related to our outlook for the first quarter ending March 31, 2018 and our future business outlook, the future demand for our products, as well as other statements that are not purely statements of historical fact, are forward-looking in nature. These are made on the basis of management's current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to those anticipated in such . We therefore cannot guarantee future results, performance or achievements. Actual results could our expectations.\nFactors that could cause actual results to the Company’s expectations include: (1) the future demand for wireless broadband access to data and fleet management software and services; (2) the growth of wireless wide-area networking and fleet management software and services; (3) customer and end-user acceptance of the Company’s current product and service offerings and market demand for the Company’s anticipated new product and service offerings; (4) increased competition and pricing pressure from participants in the markets in which the Company is engaged; (5) dependence on third-party manufacturers and key component suppliers worldwide; (6) unexpected liabilities or expenses; (7) the Company’s ability to introduce new products and services in a timely manner, including the ability to develop and launch 5G technology at the speed and functionality required by our customers; (8) litigation, regulatory and IP developments related to our products or components of our products; (9) dependence on a small number of customers for a significant portion of the Company’s revenues; and (10) the Company’s plans and expectations relating to acquisitions, divestitures, strategic relationships, international expansion, software and hardware developments, personnel matters and cost containment initiatives, including restructuring activities and the timing of their implementation.\nThese factors, as well as other factors set forth as risk factors or otherwise described in the reports filed by the Company with the SEC (available at www.sec.gov ), could cause actual results to those expressed in the Company’s . The Company assumes no obligation to update publicly any for any reason, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future, except as otherwise required pursuant to applicable law and our on-going reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nInseego Corp. has provided financial information in this news release that has not been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA, net loss and net loss per share exclude restructuring charges, net of recoveries, share-based compensation expense, amortization of discount and issuance costs related to the Company’s convertible senior notes and term loans, loss on extinguishment of debt, an impairment charge related to certain product lines the Company abandoned, net of recoveries, non-cash legal settlement charges and charges related to the Company’s acquisition and divestiture activities, net of related costs recovered. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (unrelated to acquisitions, the convertible senior notes and the term loans), charges related to the termination of our revolving credit facility and net foreign currency transaction gains and losses.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA, net loss and net loss per share are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool and are not intended to be used in isolation or as a substitute for operating expenses, net loss, net loss per share or any other performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP. We present non-GAAP operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA, net loss and net loss per share because we consider each to be an important supplemental measure of our performance.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures to make operational decisions, evaluate the Company’s performance, prepare forecasts and determine compensation. Further, management believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the Company’s performance when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. Share-based compensation expenses are expected to vary depending on the number of new incentive award grants issued to both current and new employees, the number of such grants forfeited by former employees, and changes in the Company’s stock price, stock market volatility, expected option term and risk-free interest rates, all of which are difficult to estimate. In calculating non-GAAP operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA, net loss and net loss per share, management excludes certain non-cash and one-time items in order to facilitate comparability of the Company’s operating performance on a period-to-period basis because such expenses are not, in management’s view, related to the Company’s ongoing operating performance. Management uses this view of the Company’s operating performance for purposes of comparison with its business plan and individual operating budgets and in the allocation of resources.\nThe Company further believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in providing greater transparency to the information used by management in its operational decision-making. The Company believes that the use of non-GAAP operating expenses, adjusted EBITDA, net loss and net loss per share also facilitates a comparison of our underlying operating performance with that of other companies in our industry, which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results.\nIn the future, the Company expects to continue to incur expenses similar to the non-GAAP adjustments described above, and exclusion of these items in the presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual, infrequent or non-recurring. Investors and potential investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. The limitations of relying on non-GAAP financial measures include, but are not limited to, the fact that other companies, including other companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative tool.\nInvestors and potential investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures contained within this news release with our GAAP financial results.\nINSEEGO CORP.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net revenues: Hardware $ 31,765 $ 37,973 $ 160,986 $ 187,375 SaaS, software and services 14,769 14,946 58,311 56,180 Total net revenues 46,534 52,919 219,297 243,555 Cost of net revenues: Hardware 26,698 27,541 134,795 136,936 SaaS, software and services 4,046 4,855 17,436 18,751 Impairment of abandoned product line, net of recoveries (1,758 ) 11,540 (269 ) 11,540 Total cost of net revenues 28,986 43,936 151,962 167,227 Gross profit 17,548 8,983 67,335 76,328 Operating costs and expenses: Research and development 4,574 6,407 21,362 30,655 Sales and marketing 4,679 5,720 25,019 29,782 General and administrative 7,166 17,643 34,415 52,387 Amortization of purchased intangible assets 887 1,015 3,601 3,927 Impairment of purchased intangible assets — — — 2,594 Restructuring charges, net of recoveries (546 ) 302 5,152 1,987 Total operating costs and expenses 16,760 31,087 89,549 121,332 Operating income (loss) 788 (22,104 ) (22,214 ) (45,004 ) Other income (expense): Interest expense, net (5,066 ) (3,885 ) (19,332 ) (15,597 ) Other income (expense), net (672 ) (572 ) (4,080 ) 414 Loss before income taxes (4,950 ) (26,561 ) (45,626 ) (60,187 ) Income tax provision (benefit) (1,056 ) 859 214 381 Net loss (3,894 ) (27,420 ) (45,840 ) (60,568 ) Less: Net loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests 72 19 105 (5 ) Net loss attributable to Inseego Corp. $ (3,822 ) $ (27,401 ) $ (45,735 ) $ (60,573 ) Per share data: Net loss per share: Basic and diluted $ (0.06 ) $ (0.50 ) $ (0.78 ) $ (1.12 ) Weighted-average shares used in computation of net loss per share: Basic and diluted 60,384,116 54,919,806 58,718,483 53,911,270 INSEEGO CORP.\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands)\nDecember 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 (Unaudited) ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 21,198 $ 9,894 Restricted cash 61 — Accounts receivable, net 15,674 22,203 Inventories, net 20,403 31,142 Prepaid expenses and other 9,101 5,208 Total current assets 66,437 68,447 Property, plant and equipment, net 6,991 8,392 Rental assets, net 7,563 7,003 Intangible assets, net 38,671 40,283 Goodwill 37,681 34,428 Other assets 864 163 Total assets $ 158,207 $ 158,716 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 29,332 $ 31,242 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 27,558 27,897 DigiCore bank facilities 3,075 3,238 Total current liabilities 59,965 62,377 Long-term liabilities: Convertible senior notes, net 84,773 90,908 Term loan, net 44,055 — Deferred tax liabilities, net 5,261 4,439 Other long-term liabilities 9,768 18,719 Total liabilities 203,822 176,443 Stockholders’ deficit: Common stock 59 54 Additional paid-in capital 519,531 507,616 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 4,604 (1,409 ) Accumulated deficit (569,759 ) (524,024 ) Total stockholders’ deficit attributable to Inseego Corp.
