    "text": "ZURICH, March 1 (Reuters) - Swiss money manager GAM Holding on Thursday reported underlying pre-tax earnings that exceeded even the highest analyst expectations for 2017.\nUnderlying pre-tax profit of 172.5 million Swiss francs ($182.5 million) overshot expectations for 157 million francs in a Reuters poll.\n“Over the past three years, we have undertaken a top-to-bottom revamp of our business to create an investment management firm designed to gain market share in the new industry environment,” Chief Executive Alexander Friedman said in a statement.\n“We are pleased with the financial results achieved in 2017, but recognise there is still a lot to do to deliver on the full potential of GAM.”\nGroup assets under management rose to 158.7 billion francs from 120.7 billion francs at the end of 2016.\nThe Zurich-based group reported an 8 percent drop in full-year net profit compared to a result that was boosted by a one-time tax credit in 2016.\n$1 = 0.9450 Swiss francs Reporting by Brenna Hughes Neghaiwi; Editing by Michael Shields\n ",
