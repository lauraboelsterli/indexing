Sales commission reached RMB251.2 million (US$ 38.6 million), representing an increase of 212.2% from the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue from sales-type leases was RMB26.1 million (US$4.0 million), representing revenue generation in the first quarter of launching Dabai Auto. Net income increased by 80.1% to RMB540.1 million (US$83.0 million) from RMB299.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted net income increased by 73.7% to RMB559.4 million (US$ 86.0 million) from RMB 322.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Basic and diluted net income per share was RMB1.94 (US$0.30) and RMB1.67 (US$0.26), respectively, compared with basic and diluted net income per share of RMB3.78 and RMB0.99, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Basic and diluted adjusted net income per share was RMB2.01 (US$0.31) and RMB1.73 (US$0.27), respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with basic and diluted adjusted net income per share of RMB4.06 and RMB1.06, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\n\"We are delighted to complete 2017 by achieving 108.4% and 80.1% growth year-over-year in revenue and net income, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2017,\" said Mr. Min Luo, Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Qudian. \"Our success in 2017 was driven by the technology and cost efficiency we put together that made small consumption credit accessible and affordable to hundreds of millions of creditworthy but underserved consumers in China. We also embraced the new regulations issued in the fourth quarter and believe they will promote the longer term healthy growth of the industry. As the industry leader, we have been practicing substantially all the key requirements and working closely with our partners to operate in accordance with the regulatory framework.\n\"As part of the effort to address scenario based consumption credit, we are excited to unveil 'Dabai Auto,' a new business initiative in budget auto financing, which was launched in November 2017 and has expanded rapidly,\" continued Mr. Luo. \"Of the 62.4 million registered users at Qudian, a substantial number of them sought a larger credit size than what our cash credit and merchandise credit products were offering. We believe budget auto financing is a unique opportunity to serve their credit needs under a consumption scenario, in an asset backed lower risk setting, on the back of a very large new car market. By the end of January 2018, we have established 175 off-line showrooms conveniently located in the shopping districts of 175 cities across China. We leased out 284 cars in 2017 and have cumulatively leased out over 4,800 cars as of March 10, 2018.\n\"Lastly, I also want to announce that I have signed an agreement with the Company to relinquish my salary and bonus until our market capitalization reaches US$100 billion, as measured by the daily closing quotation of the New York Stock Exchange. This affirms my deep conviction in Qudian's tremendous growth potential and my focus on driving shareholder value,\" Mr. Luo concluded.\n\"We delivered excellent financial results in the fourth quarter with a net profit of RMB540.1 million, finishing 2017 with a full year net profit of over RMB2.1 billion,\" said Mr. Carl Yeung, Chief Financial Officer of Qudian. \"In the fourth quarter, we reached total registered users of 62.4 million, including 26.2 million users who have been approved for credit, of which 6.9 million actively utilized their credit.\n\"As the regulatory environment develops, our position in the industry should further solidify over time as smaller, non-compliant players are forced to exit. During this phase, the overall industry credit quality deteriorates as liquidity, measured by credit availability, for borrowers declines,\" continued Mr. Yeung. \"As a result, we experienced an increase in our delinquency rate since the new regulations were issued in December. Therefore, we swiftly implemented a conservative strategy of reducing credit volumes since December of 2017 to protect credit quality. This action was effective as initial delinquency for new credits facilitated in January stabilized, providing a new basis for credit volumes to grow again after Chinese New Year. Based on current data, we expect consumption credit to return to a stable growth track and anticipate Dabai Auto to turn profitable within the first year of operation, establishing a strong case to initiate full year 2018 guidance.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 108.4% to RMB1,491.2 million (US$229.2 million) from RMB715.6 million in the prior year period, primarily due to the increase in financing income as a result of the substantial increase in the volume of on-balance sheet transactions. Financing income totaled RMB1,060.9 million (US$163.1 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017, increasing 73.4% from RMB611.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Loan facilitation income and others increased to RMB149.5 million (US$23.0 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017, up 587.2% from RMB21.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, as a result of the substantial increase in the volume of off-balance sheet transactions. Sales commission fees increased to RMB 251.2 million (US$38.6 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017, up 212.2% from RMB80.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in sales commissions was mainly a result of an increase in merchandise credit utilized by borrowers to purchase merchandise via Qudian's marketplace.\nTotal operating cost and expenses. Total operating cost and expenses increased by 164.3% to RMB943.0 million (US$144.9 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB356.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCost of revenues increased by 173.4% to RMB305.4 million (US$46.9 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB111.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, due to higher interest expenses on borrowings because of increased use of funds provided by institutional funding partners.\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased by 38.9% to RMB94.4 million (US$14.5 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB68.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.

General and administrative expenses decreased by 25.1% to RMB64.3 million (US$9.9 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB85.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in salaries and benefits expense, which was partly offset by the increase in administrative fees payable to trust companies as a result of increased use of trust funding in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses increased by 36.0% to RMB37.1 million (US$5.7 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB27.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits expense in order to further enhance our data analytics and risk management capabilities.\nProvision for loan principal, financing service fee receivables and other receivables. Provision for loan principal, financing service fee receivables and other receivables increased by 435.1% to RMB337.8 million (US$51.9 million) for the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB63.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the M1+ overdue loan principals and financing services fees receivables, which we intend to provide sufficient allowance to cover.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the total balance of outstanding principal for on-balance sheet transactions for which any installment payment was more than 30 calendar days past due was RMB403.9 million (US$62.1 million), and the balance of allowance for principal and financing service fee receivables at the end of the period was RMB519.3 million (US$79.8 million), indicating M1+ Delinquency Coverage Ratio of 1.3x.\nThe following chart displays the historical lifetime cumulative M1+ Delinquency Rate by Vintage from the second month after credit drawdowns up to the twelfth month after such transactions for all transactions for each of the quarters in 2016 and the first three quarters in 2017, before charge-offs:\nClick here to view the chart.\nIncome from operations.

Income tax expenses decreased by 70.8% to RMB18.8 million (US$2.9 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB64.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to the increase of tax refund.\nNet income.
