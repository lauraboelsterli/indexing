Our mission is to bring comfort to individuals around the world, and we believe that we can achieve this goal while also driving sustained profitability and value for our shareholders over the long-term.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Review\nFourth quarter 2017 net revenue increased 156.1% to $63.0 million, compared to $24.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in net revenue was driven primarily by higher direct-to-consumer demand for our original Purple mattress fueled by increased marketing investments and an improved manufacturing capacity to fulfill orders.\nGross margin for the fourth quarter 2017 was 45.2% compared to 39.8% in the year ago period. The 540 basis point increase was driven by multiple efficiency gains associated with scale and manufacturing improvements combined with leveraging our fixed cost structure on higher revenue.\nOperating expenses were $30.4 million in the fourth quarter 2017 compared to $10.0 million in the prior year period. The increase in operating expenses is primarily attributable to higher marketing investments to expand brand awareness and drive direct-to-consumer demand for the Company's product portfolio.\nOperating loss was $1.9 million, compared to a loss of $0.2 million in the prior year. Adjusted operating loss was $0.9 million compared to an adjusted operating income of $0.4 million, which excluded one-time, non-recurring costs related to the business combination transaction with Global Partner Acquisition Corp. The adjusted operating income for fourth quarter 2016 excluded a loss on disposal of property and equipment.\nFull Year 2017 Review\nFull year 2017 net revenue increased 200.6% to $196.9 million, compared to $65.5 million in 2016. The increase in net revenue was driven primarily by higher direct-to-consumer demand for our original Purple mattress and companion bedding products fueled by increased marketing investments and an improved manufacturing capacity to fulfill orders.\nGross margin for the full year 2017 was 44.9% compared to 32.8% in the prior year. The increase was driven by multiple efficiency gains associated with scale and manufacturing improvements combined with leveraging our fixed cost structure on higher revenue.\nOperating expenses were $93.8 million for the 2017 year compared to $23.3 million in the prior year. The increase in operating expenses is primarily attributable to higher marketing investments to expand brand awareness and drive consumer demand for the Company's product portfolio. In addition, general and administrative costs increased to support the growth of the business.\nOperating loss was $5.4 million, compared to a loss of $1.9 million in 2016. Adjusted operating loss was $3.5 million compared to an adjusted operating income of $2.5 million. The 2017 year adjusted operating loss excluded one-time, non-recurring costs related to the business combination transaction with Global Partner Acquisition Corp. as well as non-recurring legal expenses. The adjusted operating income for 2016 excluded a loss on disposal of property and equipment.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $3.6 million compared to $4.0 million as of December 31, 2016. Inventories at the end of 2017 totaled $15.8 million compared with $5.3 million at the end of 2016.\nTransaction\nOn February 2, 2018 Global Partner Acquisition Corp. a special purpose acquisition company and predecessor to the Company (\"GPAC\" or the \"Company\"), and Purple Innovation, LLC (\"Purple\") announced the completion of a business combination, pursuant to which Purple became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

These non-GAAP financial measures are EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating loss. Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP measures differently than we do. These non-GAAP measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Loss to Non-GAAP EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nA reconciliation of GAAP net loss to the non-GAAP measures of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is provided below. EBITDA represents net loss before other income, interest expense, and depreciation and amortization.
