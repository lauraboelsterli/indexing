I know people don't like the group, but that's the one I like.\"\nMcDonald's : \"Forget the calls. I like [CEO] Steve Easterbrook. I would just go buy the common [stock]. I'm not going to recommend calls on this show.\"\nWatch the full lightning round here: show chapters Cramer's lightning round: Freeport-McMoRan is a nice hedge on this market 17 Hours Ago | 02:40 ",
