    "text": "SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Unexpected additional costs for flight testing the new KC-390 military airlifter led Embraer to miss 2017 profit targets that the company had reaffirmed in October, Chief Financial Officer Jose Filippo told journalists on Thursday.\nIn November, Embraer said it had stopped flying the first prototype of the KC-390, which is due to enter service this year, after a stall test pushed the cargo jet beyond its operating limits. Filippo said the plane has resumed testing.\nReporting by Brad Haynes; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ",
