Soccer Football - Premier League - Swansea City vs West Ham United - Liberty Stadium, Swansea, Britain - March 3, 2018 West Ham United's Mark Noble warms up before the match Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Boyers West Ham have won five and drawn four of their 13 home league games, which includes a win over champions Chelsea and a draw with Arsenal. They have nine defeats in 16 away matches. Six of the club’s nine remaining league games are to be played at the London Stadium and Noble is confident that home advantage can help West Ham avoid relegation. “They are all big games now and we just need to knuckle down and get the results we need to get ourselves out of trouble come the end of the season,” Noble told the club’s website. (www.whufc.com) “I don’t think we will wilt because we’re at home, which is a big plus for us at the minute, because we’re playing well at London Stadium. “We need to get points, it’s as simple as that. Do I think we’ll be fine? Yes, because I think we’ve got enough here and we will pick up results.” West Ham’s run of three defeats in their last four league matches has left them in 14th position, just three points above 18th-placed Crystal Palace. After Burnley’s visit, David Moyes’ side host fellow relegation strugglers Southampton and Stoke City, league leaders Manchester City and Manchester United, and 11th-placed Everton in their remaining home fixtures. West Ham, who lost 4-1 at Swansea City last weekend, also play tough away fixtures at Chelsea, Arsenal and Leicester City. “We need to play with high intensity and go back to how we played against Chelsea and Arsenal before Christmas, with a real desire not to concede goals,” added Noble. “If we do that, we’ll be fine.” Reporting by Aditi Prakash in Bengaluru",
