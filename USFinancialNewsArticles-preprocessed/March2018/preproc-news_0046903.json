    "text": "NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will engage with the United States to discuss its concerns on Indiaâ€™s export subsidies and respond within 60 days, the federal trade secretary said on Wednesday.\nFILE PHOTO - A worker walks past a container ship at Mundra Port in the western Indian state of Gujarat April 1, 2014. REUTERS/Amit Dave/File Photo The United States on Wednesday launched a challenge to Indian export subsidies at the World Trade Organization, saying they hurt U.S. companies by letting Indian exporters sell goods more cheaply.\nIndia provides exemptions from certain duties, taxes and fees that benefit numerous Indian exporters, including producers of steel products, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, textiles and information technology products, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said.\nReporting by Manoj Kumar; Editing by Sanjeev Miglani\n ",
