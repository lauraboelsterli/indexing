    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BP Midstream Partners LP (NYSE: BPMP):\nBusiness\nHighlights\nCompleted initial public offering (the “IPO”) on NYSE on October 30, 2017\nGross throughput on a pro forma basis increased by 15%, as compared to 2016 •\nOn October 30, 2017, BP Midstream Partners LP (“BPMP,” the “Partnership,” “we,” “us” or “our”) completed its IPO of 42,500,000 common units representing limited partner interests at a price to the public of $18.00 per unit. Subsequent to the closing of the IPO, the underwriters partially exercised their over-allotment option and purchased 5,294,358 additional common units at $18.00 per unit.\n•\nPipeline gross throughput on a pro forma basis (including amounts related to our unconsolidated equity investments) in 2017 increased by 15%, as compared to 2016, underpinned by higher throughput on BP#2 crude oil pipeline system and production growth in the Gulf of Mexico.\nFinancial\nHighlights\nFinancial highlights for the period subsequent to the IPO:\nGenerated net income attributable to the Partnership of $21.8 million\nGenerated net cash from operating activities attributable to the Partnership of $29.2 million\nReported Adjusted EBITDA* attributable to the Partnership of $23.5 million\nGenerated cash available for distribution* attributable to the Partnership of $23.3 million\nDeclared $0.1798 per unit prorated quarterly distribution\n•\nRevenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $27.6 million, of which $19.5 million were related to the period subsequent to the IPO. BP p.l.c. (\"BP\") and its affiliates accounted for 98% of these revenues.\n•\nTotal maintenance spend** for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $2.6 million, which included $2.4 million of maintenance expenses and $0.2 million of maintenance capital expenditures. Total maintenance spend subsequent to the IPO was $1.5 million, which included $1.4 million of maintenance expenses and $0.1 million of maintenance capital expenditures.\n•\nCash on hand was $32.7 million, and outstanding borrowings were $15.0 million under our $600.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with an affiliate of BP, at December 31, 2017.\n•\nOn January 17, 2018, the board of directors declared its first cash distribution of $0.1798 per limited partner unit for the period subsequent to the IPO. This amount corresponds to the prorated minimum quarterly distribution of $0.2625 per unit, or $1.05 per unit on an annualized basis.\n•\nDistribution coverage ratio was 1.2 times for the period subsequent to the IPO.\n*\nAdjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures. See reconciliation tables later in this press release.\n**\nTotal maintenance spend represents the sum of the Partnership’s maintenance expenses and its maintenance capital expenditures during the period indicated. Because the Partnership recognizes significant maintenance expenses that are not capitalized, the combined total maintenance spend represents a more complete measure of its ongoing maintenance efforts.\nWebcast and\nConference\nCall\nA webcast and conference call will be held at 9:00 a.m. CST, hosted by Robert Zinsmeister, Chief Executive Officer, Craig Coburn, Chief Financial Officer, and Brian Sullivan, Vice President Investor Relations, to discuss BPMP’s performance in the fourth quarter and the full year 2017. Interested parties may listen to the presentation at www.bpmidstreampartners.com , by clicking on the “2017 Fourth Quarter Financial Results Webcast” link, found under the \"Events & presentations\" section. A replay of the webcast will be available following the live event. The Partnership has also posted an updated investor presentation to its website. Information on the Partnership's website does not constitute a portion of this press release.\nRobert Zinsmeister – Chief Executive Officer:\n“Following the successful initial public offering of BPMP, we have delivered a solid set of results for our first quarter as a listed entity and we are excited about the opportunities in front of us. As a sponsored MLP, we have a strong relationship with BP, which is well capitalized with an investment-grade credit rating and will maintain a significant interest in BPMP. Our asset portfolio is strategically located and highly integrated which will create stable and predictable cash flows giving us the financial flexibility to execute our growth aspirations.”\nAbout BP Midstream Partners\nBPMP is a fee-based, growth-oriented master limited partnership formed by BP Pipelines (North America), Inc. (“BP Pipelines”) to own, operate, develop and acquire pipelines and other midstream assets. BPMP’s assets consist of interests in entities that own crude oil, natural gas, refined products and diluent pipelines serving as key infrastructure for BP and other customers to transport onshore crude oil production to BP’s Whiting Refinery and offshore crude oil and natural gas production to key refining markets and trading and distribution hubs. Certain of BPMP’s assets deliver refined products and diluent from the Whiting Refinery and other U.S. supply hubs to major demand centers.\nFor more information on BPMP and the assets owned by BPMP, please visit www.bpmidstreampartners.com .\nFactors Affecting Comparability\nThe financial results prior to the IPO on October 30, 2017 only included the results of the BP2, River Rouge and Diamondback pipeline systems and related assets (collectively, “our accounting predecessor”, the “Predecessor”, or the “Wholly Owned Assets”). Our equity method investment, Mars Pipeline Company LLC, and our consolidated subsidiary, Mardi Gras Transportation System Company LLC, are not included in the results of our accounting predecessor. Effective October 30, 2017, the Partnership pays an annual fee to BP Pipelines, initially $13.3 million, for general and administrative services, and reimburses BP Pipelines for operating services under an omnibus agreement with BP Pipelines. In addition, we are expected to incur incremental cash expenses associated with being a publicly traded partnership. Effective October 30, 2017, the Partnership entered into commercial agreements that contain minimum volume commitments with a major related-party customer. These agreements were not in place prior to the IPO. Federal and state income taxes were reflected on the historical financial statements of our accounting predecessor. BPMP is a non-taxable entity and will not record any income tax expense in its consolidated financial statements.\nFactors affecting comparability are detailed further in the “Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Results” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 22, 2018.\nCautionary Statement\nCertain statements contained in this news release constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements represent BPMP’s expectations or beliefs concerning future events, and it is possible that the results described in this news release will not be achieved. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside of BPMP’s control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and, except as required by law, BPMP does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for BPMP to predict all such factors. When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements found in BPMP’s filings with the SEC, including the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed with SEC on March 22, 2018. The risk factors and other factors noted in BPMP’s SEC filings could cause its actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes the terms Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution. Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, may use to assess:\nour operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry, without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of Adjusted EBITDA, financing methods; the ability of our business to generate sufficient cash to support our decision to make distributions to our unitholders; our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities.\nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution provides useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution are net income and net cash provided by operating activities, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income or net cash provided by operating activities.\nAdjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some but not all items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA or cash available for distribution in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, because Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of Adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.\nReferences to Adjusted EBITDA in this press release refer to net income before net interest expense, income taxes, gain or loss from disposition of property, plant and equipment and depreciation and amortization, plus cash distributed to the Partnership from equity method investments for the applicable period, less income from equity method investments. We define Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Partnership as Adjusted EBITDA less Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests. We define cash available for distribution as Adjusted EBITDA attributable to the Partnership LP less maintenance capital expenditures attributable to the Partnership, net interest paid/received, cash reserves, income taxes paid and net adjustments from volume deficiency payments attributable to the Partnership. Cash available for distribution will not reflect changes in working capital balances.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, (in thousands of dollars, unless otherwise indicated) 2017 (1) 2016 (2) 2017 (1) 2016 (3) Revenue $ 27,607 $ 21,466 $ 108,151 $ 103,003 Costs and expenses Operating expenses 3,975 4,022 16,167 14,141 Maintenance expenses 1,990 879 4,898 2,918 Loss/(Gain) from disposition of property, plant and equipment 1 — (5 ) — General and administrative 3,938 2,755 7,565 8,159 Depreciation 666 687 2,673 2,604 Property and other taxes 126 111 393 366 Total costs and expenses 10,696 8,454 31,691 28,188 Operating income 16,911 13,012 76,460 74,815 Income from equity method investments 17,916 — 17,916 — Other income 133 235 25 520 Interest expense, net 107 — 107 — Income tax expense 2,099 5,181 25,318 29,465 Net income 32,754 $ 8,066 68,976 $ 45,870 Less: Predecessor net income prior to the IPO on October 30, 2017 2,880 39,102 Net income subsequent to the IPO 29,874 29,874 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 8,099 8,099 Net income attributable to the Partnership subsequent to the IPO $ 21,775 $ 21,775 Net income attributable to the Partnership per limited partner unit - basic and diluted (in dollars): Common units $ 0.21 $ 0.21 Subordinated units $ 0.21 $ 0.21 Distributions per limited partner unit (in dollars): Common units $ 0.1798 $ 0.1798 Subordinated units $ 0.1798 $ 0.1798 Weighted average number of limited partner units outstanding - basic and diluted (in millions): Common units – public 47.8 47.8 Common units – BP Holdco 4.6 4.6 Subordinated units – BP Holdco 52.4 52.4 (1) Our revenue and operating income for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 reflect results of our accounting predecessor from October 1, 2017 to October 29, 2017 and January 1, 2017 to October 29, 2017, respectively, and results of the Partnership from October 30, 2017 to December 31, 2017.
