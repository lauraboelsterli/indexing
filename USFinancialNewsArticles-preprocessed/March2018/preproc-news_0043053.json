    "text": "TSX: WPM\nNYSE: WPM\nVANCOUVER, March 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Wheaton Precious Metals™ Corp. (\"Wheaton\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce its results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. All figures are presented in United States dollars unless otherwise noted.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Wheaton generated over $165 million of operating cash flow, resulting in over $535 million for the year. Wheaton's strong cash flow generation was founded on production of over 350 thousand ounces of gold and over 28 million ounces of silver, both in excess of Company guidance. Finally, subsequent to the quarter, Wheaton announced the proposed new San Dimas precious metal stream as part of the First Majestic Silver Corp. arrangement transaction, which should result in a stronger, more sustainable operation at the San Dimas mine.\nOperational Overview\nQ4 2017\nQ4 2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nOunces produced\nSilver\n7,211\n7,589\n(5.0)%\n28,646\n30,379\n(5.7)%\nGold\n96,474\n111,664\n(13.6)%\n355,104\n366,378\n(3.1)%\nOunces sold\nSilver\n7,292\n7,506\n(2.9)%\n24,644\n28,322\n(13.0)%\nGold\n94,295\n108,931\n(13.4)%\n337,205\n330,009\n2.2 %\nSales price per ounce\nSilver\n$\n16.75\n$\n16.95\n(1.2)%\n$\n17.01\n$\n16.96\n0.3 %\nGold\n$\n1,277\n$\n1,205\n6.0 %\n$\n1,257\n$\n1,246\n0.9 %\nCash costs per ounce 1\nSilver 1\n$\n4.48\n$\n4.59\n(2.4)%\n$\n4.49\n$\n4.42\n1.6 %\nGold 1\n$\n399\n$\n389\n2.6 %\n$\n395\n$\n391\n1.0 %\nCash operating margin per ounce 1\nSilver 1\n$\n12.27\n$\n12.36\n(0.7)%\n$\n12.52\n$\n12.54\n(0.2)%\nGold 1\n$\n878\n$\n816\n7.6 %\n$\n862\n$\n855\n0.8 %\nRevenue\n$\n242,546\n$\n258,491\n(6.2)%\n$\n843,215\n$\n891,557\n(5.4)%\nNet earnings\n$\n(137,712)\n$\n10,865\nn.a.\n$\n57,703\n$\n195,137\n(70.4)%\nPer share\n$\n(0.31)\n$\n0.02\nn.a.\n$\n0.13\n$\n0.45\n(71.1)%\nAdjusted net earnings 1\n$\n82,323\n$\n81,865\n0.6 %\n$\n276,750\n$\n266,137\n4.0 %\nPer share 1\n$\n0.19\n$\n0.19\n0.3 %\n$\n0.63\n$\n0.62\n1.3 %\nOperating cash flows\n$\n165,083\n$\n174,702\n(5.5)%\n$\n538,808\n$\n584,301\n(7.8)%\nPer share 1\n$\n0.37\n$\n0.40\n(7.5)%\n$\n1.22\n$\n1.36\n(10.3)%\nDividends declared 1\n$\n39,815\n$\n26,475\n50.4 %\n$\n145,848\n$\n90,612\n61.0 %\nPer share\n$\n0.09\n$\n0.06\n50.0 %\n$\n0.33\n$\n0.21\n57.1 %\nAll amounts in thousands except gold ounces produced and sold, per ounce amounts and per share amounts.\nHighlights\nAttributable silver and gold production for the year ended December 31, 2017 exceeded production guidance of 28 million ounces of silver and 340,000 ounces of gold. The decrease in attributable silver production for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to lower production from the San Dimas mine resulting from various operational issues coupled with the expiry of the Cozamin silver purchase agreement. The decrease in attributable gold production for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, which was in line with expectations, was a result of a reduction of the Company's share of the gold production at the 777 mine from 100% to 50% effective January 1, 2017 coupled with reduced production at Minto. The Company achieved record gold sales volume during the year ended December 31, 2017. During the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $229 million. The impairment charge was in relation to the Pascua-Lama project. The Company paid out a record level of dividends in 2017. Declared quarterly dividend of $0.09 per common share relative to the three months ended December 31, 2017. This represents an increase of 29% relative to the comparable period in 2016.\nSubsequent to the Quarter\nIn conjunction with the proposed acquisition by First Majestic Silver Corp. (\"First Majestic\") of Primero Mining Corp. (\"Primero\"), Wheaton has agreed to terminate the existing San Dimas silver purchase agreement and enter into a new precious metals purchase agreement relating to the San Dimas mine with First Majestic.\nOutlook\nWheaton's estimated attributable production in 2018 is forecast to be 22.5 million ounces of silver and 355,000 ounces of gold. Wheaton's estimated average annual attributable production over the next five years (including 2018) is anticipated to be approximately 25 million ounces of silver and 370,000 ounces of gold.\n\"Wheaton's high quality portfolio of low-cost, long-life assets once again exceeded production guidance for both gold and silver, resulting in sector-leading operating cash flow of over $535 million in 2017. With 30% of our cash flows being distributed in dividends, we now provide the highest yield of all the precious metal streamers,\" said Randy Smallwood, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wheaton Precious Metals. \"We also took significant steps to further strengthen our portfolio, including restructuring the stream at San Dimas, and we look forward to welcoming First Majestic as a new partner. Finally, in addition to the substantial organic optionality embedded in our current portfolio, we see a solid pipeline of new opportunities for additional accretive growth.\"\nFinancial Review\nRevenues\nRevenue was $243 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, on sales volume of 7.3 million ounces of silver and 94,300 ounces of gold. This represents a 6% decrease from the $258 million of revenue generated in the fourth quarter of 2016 due primarily to (i) a 13% decrease in the number of gold ounces sold; (ii) a 3% decrease in the number of silver ounces sold; and (iii) a 1% decrease in the average realized silver price ($16.75 in Q4 2017 compared with $16.95 in Q4 2016); partially offset by (iv) a 6% increase in the average realized gold price ($1,277 in Q4 2017 compared with $1,205 in Q4 2016).\nRevenue was $843 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, on sales volume of 24.6 million ounces of silver and 337,200 ounces of gold. This represents a 5% decrease from the $892 million of revenue generated in 2016 due primarily to (i) a 13% decrease in the number of silver ounces sold; partially offset by (ii) a 2% increase in the number of gold ounces sold; and (iii) a 1% increase in the average realized gold price ($1,257 in 2017 compared with $1,246 in 2016).\nCosts and Expenses\nAverage cash costs 1 in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $4.48 per silver ounce sold and $399 per gold ounce sold, as compared with $4.59 per silver ounce and $389 per gold ounce during the comparable period of 2016. This resulted in a cash operating margin 1 of $12.27 per silver ounce sold and $878 per gold ounce sold, a decrease of 1% per silver ounce sold and an increase of 8% per ounce of gold sold as compared with Q4 2016. The increase in the gold cash operating margin was primarily due to a 6% increase in the average realized gold price in Q4 2017 compared with Q4 2016 while the decrease in the silver cash operating margin was primarily due to a 1% decrease in the average realized silver price during the same period.\nAverage cash costs 1 during the year ended December 31, 2017 were $4.49 per silver ounce sold and $395 per gold ounce sold, as compared with $4.42 per silver ounce sold and $391 per gold ounce sold during the comparable period of 2016. This resulted in a cash operating margin 1 of $12.52 per silver ounce sold and $862 per gold ounce sold, an increase of 1% per gold ounce sold while the cash operating margin 1 per ounce of silver sold was virtually unchanged as compared with 2016.\nEarnings and Operating Cash Flows\nAdjusted net earnings 1 and cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $82 million ($0.19 per share) and $165 million ($0.37 per share¹), compared with adjusted net earnings 1 of $82 million ($0.19 per share) and cash flow from operations of $175 million ($0.40 per share 1 ) for the same period in 2016, an increase of 1% and a decrease of 6%, respectively.\nAdjusted net earnings 1 and cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $277 million ($0.63 per share) and $539 million ($1.22 per share 1 ), compared with adjusted net earnings 1 of $266 million ($0.62 per share) and cash flow from operations of $584 million ($1.36 per share 1 ) for the same period in 2016, an increase of 4% and a decrease of 8%, respectively.\nBalance Sheet\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $99 million of cash on hand and $770 million outstanding under the Company's $2 billion revolving term loan (the \"Revolving Facility\"). On February 27, 2018, the term of the Revolving Facility was extended so that it now matures on February 27, 2023.\nAsset Impairment\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company assesses each precious metal purchase agreement (\"PMPA\") to determine whether any indication of impairment exists. If such an indication exists, the recoverable amount of the precious metal purchase agreement is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment (if any).\nAs per Barrick Gold Corp.'s (\"Barrick\") fourth quarter of 2017 MD&A, in January 2018, Barrick received a revised resolution from Chile's environmental regulator (the Superintendencia del Medio Ambiente, or \"SMA\") in connection with the previously disclosed SMA regulatory sanctions requiring the closure of existing infrastructure on the Chilean side of the Pascua-Lama project. Barrick has indicated that the resolution does not affect Barrick's ongoing evaluation of an underground, block-caving operation at Pascua-Lama, which would require additional permitting and regulatory approvals in both Argentina and Chile, unconnected to the recent SMA decision. In light of the order to close surface facilities in Chile, and current plans to evaluate an underground mine, Barrick has reclassified Pascua-Lama's Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves of approximately 14 million ounces of gold, which are based on an open pit mine plan, as Measured and Indicated Resources. As a result, Wheaton has also reclassified 151.7 million ounces of silver Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves associated with Pascua-Lama as Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources.\nAs this resolution affects Barrick's ability to advance the Pascua-Lama project as an open pit mine and coupled with the resulting reclassification of open-pit reserves to resources, the Company has determined there to be an indicator of impairment of this asset in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe Pascua-Lama PMPA had a carrying value at December 31, 2017 of $485 million. Management has estimated that the recoverable amount at December 31, 2017 under the Pascua-Lama PMPA was $256 million, representing its fair value less cost of disposal and resulting in an impairment charge of $229 million.\nIf the requirements of the completion test have not been satisfied by the completion test deadline of June 30, 2020, the Company may, within 90 days of such date, elect to terminate the Pascua Lama silver purchase agreement in which case the Company will be entitled to a return of a portion of the original upfront cash payment of $625 million, reduced by the cash flows received relative to the Lagunas Norte, Veladero, and Pierina mines. As at December 31, 2017, the Company has received approximately 19.1 million ounces related to silver production from these mines, generating cumulative operating cash flows of approximately $364 million.\nFourth Quarter Asset Highlights\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, attributable production was 7.2 million ounces of silver and 96,500 ounces of gold, representing a decrease of 5% and 14%, respectively, compared with the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOperational highlights for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, based upon counterparties' reporting, are as follows:\nSalobo\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Salobo produced 76,200 ounces of attributable gold, a decrease of approximately 2% relative to the fourth quarter of 2016 as lower grades and recovery were partially offset by increased throughput.\nAccording to Vale S.A.'s (\"Vale\") fourth quarter of 2017 production report, production was positively impacted mainly due to stronger plant performance which resulted in record quarterly production of copper concentrate. The Salobo plant operated above nameplate capacity on average for a second consecutive quarter in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nPeñasquito\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Peñasquito produced 1.6 million ounces of attributable silver, an increase of approximately 18% relative to the fourth quarter of 2016 due to higher silver grades, recoveries and tonnage. According to Goldcorp Inc.'s (\"Goldcorp\") fourth quarter of 2017 MD&A, increased throughput at Peñasquito was driven by the implementation of a new management operating system and better ore delivery to the primary crusher.\nAccording to Goldcorp, the Pyrite Leach Project (\"PLP\") at Peñasquito was 62% complete as of December 31, 2017, and expected to commence commissioning in the fourth quarter of 2018, three months ahead of schedule. The PLP is reportedly expected to recover approximately 40% of the gold and 48% of the silver currently reporting to the tailings, and is expected to add production of approximately 1 million ounces of gold and 44 million ounces of silver over the current life of the mine. As a reminder, Wheaton is entitled to 25% of the silver produced at Peñasquito for the life of mine, or 11 million of the additional 44 million silver ounces.\nAntamina\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Antamina produced 1.5 million ounces of attributable silver, a decrease of approximately 8% relative to the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to lower grades and throughput, partially offset by higher recovery.\nSan Dimas\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, San Dimas produced 1.3 million ounces of attributable silver, a decrease of approximately 7% relative to the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to a decrease in throughput, which was partially offset by better grades.\nAs announced on January 12, 2018, Wheaton has agreed to terminate the existing San Dimas silver purchase agreement (the \"Primero SPA\") with Primero and enter into a new precious metals purchase agreement with First Majestic relating to the San Dimas mine (the \"San Dimas PMPA\"), in conjunction with the proposed acquisition by First Majestic of Primero pursuant to a plan of arrangement transaction (the \"Arrangement\"). Under the San Dimas PMPA: 25% of gold production plus an additional amount of gold equal to 25% of silver production converted to gold at a fixed gold to silver exchange ratio of 70:1 from the San Dimas mine; for each ounce of gold delivered, Wheaton will pay to First Majestic a production payment equal to the lesser of US$600/oz, subject to a 1% annual inflationary adjustment, and the prevailing market price; and First Majestic will provide a corporate guarantee and security to be limited to San Dimas assets. As part of the transaction, in addition to the new stream, Wheaton will receive 20,914,590 First Majestic common shares. Primero has indicated that closing of the Arrangement is anticipated to occur before the end of April 2018. 2\nSudbury\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Vale's Sudbury mines produced 8,600 ounces of attributable gold, a decrease of approximately 4% relative to the fourth quarter of 2016 primarily due to lower throughput, partially offset by higher grades and recovery. According to Vale's fourth quarter of 2017 production report, the decrease in throughput was primarily due to the extended unscheduled maintenance at the Coleman mine as well as the cessation of mining activities at the Stobie mine since the second quarter of 2017.\nConstancia\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Constancia produced 0.7 million ounces of attributable silver and 2,900 ounces of attributable gold, a decrease of approximately 7% and 6%, respectively, relative to the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in production was primarily the result of the processing of lower grade ore as expected in Hudbay Mineral Inc.'s (\"Hudbay\") mine plan partially offset by higher throughput and silver recovery.\nOther Gold\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, total Other Gold attributable production was 8,800 ounces, a decrease of approximately 60% relative to the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease was relatively in line with expectations and primarily due to the anticipated reduction of the Company's share of the gold production at the 777 mine from 100% to 50% effective January 1, 2017, coupled with reduced production at the Minto mine due to lower grades as part of the extended mine plan.\nOther Silver\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, total Other Silver attributable production was 2.2 million ounces, a decrease of approximately 13% relative to the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease was driven primarily by the cessation of production from Cozamin as the Cozamin silver purchase agreement with Capstone Mining Corp. (\"Capstone\") expired on April 4, 2017.\nIn October 2015, in order to incentivize additional exploration and potentially extend the limited remaining mine life of Stratoni, Wheaton and Eldorado Gold Corp. (\"Eldorado\") agreed to modify the Stratoni silver purchase agreement. The primary modification was to increase the production price per ounce of silver delivered to Wheaton based on the amount of exploration Eldorado completed. As a result, according to Eldorado's news release dated November 13, 2017, Eldorado has completed over 5,900 metres of underground exploration drilling that demonstrated continuity of the orebody into previously untested areas. Eldorado further reports that it has two drill rigs currently active at the mine testing additional stepouts to the deposit.\nDevelopment Update - Kutcho\nEffective December 14, 2017, Wheaton participated in an equity financing undertaken by Kutcho Copper Corp. (\"Kutcho\") in connection with the Kutcho Early Deposit Agreement, acquiring, by way of private placement, 6,153,846 common shares and warrants to acquire an additional 3,076,923 common shares of Kutcho for total consideration of $3 million (Cdn$4 million). Additionally, the Company advanced to Kutcho $16 million (Cdn$20 million) in exchange for a subordinated secured convertible term debt loan agreement receivable bearing interest at 10% per annum.\nProduced But Not Yet Delivered 3\nAs at December 31, 2017, payable ounces attributable to the Company produced but not yet delivered 3 amounted to 4.5 million payable silver ounces and 79,500 payable gold ounces, representing a decrease of 0.7 million payable silver ounces and 3,200 payable gold ounces during the three month period ended December 31, 2017. Payable silver ounces produced but not yet delivered decreased primarily as a result of decreases related to the Yauliyacu, Antamina, Zinkgruvan and Peñasquito silver interests. Payable gold ounces produced but not yet delivered decreased primarily as a result of decreases related to the Sudbury gold interest partially offset by increases at the Salobo and Minto gold interests. Payable ounces produced but not yet delivered to the Wheaton Precious Metals group of companies are expected to average approximately two months of annualized production for silver and two to three months for gold but may vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of mining operation factors including mine ramp-up and timing of shipments.\nDetailed mine-by-mine production and sales figures can be found in the Appendix to this press release and in Wheaton's consolidated MD&A in the 'Results of Operations and Operational Review' section.\nEvents Subsequent to the Quarter\nMinto Mine\nAs per Capstone's news release dated February 2, 2018, Capstone has entered into a definitive share purchase agreement pursuant to which it has agreed to sell its Minto mine to Pembridge Resources plc (\"Pembridge\"). Capstone expects the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2018. According to Capstone's fourth quarter of 2017 MD&A, at the start of 2017, it was Capstone's intention to place the Minto mine on care and maintenance at the end of 2017, but as a result of rising copper prices and the downside protection provided by the renegotiation of the precious metals stream with Wheaton in 2017, Capstone had made the decision to continue operations until at least mid-2021.\nReserves and Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves attributable to Wheaton were 572.8 million ounces of silver compared with 727.8 million ounces as reported in Wheaton's 2016 Annual Information Form (\"AIF\"), a decrease of 21%, and 11.31 million ounces of gold compared with 11.41 million ounces, a decrease of 1%. On an attributable Measured and Indicated Mineral Resource basis, silver resources were 894.2 million ounces compared with 807.3 million ounces as reported in Wheaton's 2016 AIF, an increase of 11%, and gold resources were 2.81 million ounces compared with 2.97 million ounces, a decrease of 5%. On an attributable Inferred Mineral Resource basis, silver resources were 452.0 million ounces compared with 381.2 million ounces as reported in Wheaton's 2016 AIF, an increase of 19%, and gold resources were 2.76 million ounces compared with 2.80 million ounces, a decrease of 1%.\nEstimated attributable reserves and resources contained in this press release are based on information available to the Company as of March 21, 2018, and therefore will not reflect updates, if any, after that date, including those changes associated with the termination of the Primero SPA and entering into of the San Dimas PMPA by Wheaton. Updated reserves and resources data incorporating year-end 2017 estimates will also be included in the Company's 2017 Annual Information Form. Wheaton's most current attributable reserves and resources, as of December 31, 2017, can be found on the Company's website at www.wheatonpm.com .\n2018 and Long-Term Production Forecast\nWheaton is pleased to provide its updated one-year and long-term production guidance. Wheaton's estimated attributable silver and gold production in 2018 is forecast to be approximately 22.5 million silver ounces and 355,000 gold ounces. Estimated average annual attributable silver and gold production over the next five years (including 2018) is anticipated to be approximately 25 million silver ounces and 370,000 gold ounces per year.\nIn 2018, forecast production growth from Peñasquito and Constancia is expected to be offset by the changes in the San Dimas stream as well as the cessation of production from assets with fixed terms. In conjunction with First Majestic's proposed acquisition of Primero, the Primero SPA is expected to terminate and a new precious metals purchase agreement entered into at a reduced level starting in the second quarter of 2018. In addition, the 10-year-term contract on Capstone's Cozamin mine, acquired with Wheaton's 2009 acquisition of Silverstone, expired in April 2017, and Wheaton's streaming agreement with Barrick regarding Pascua-Lama provides the Company with silver production from the Lagunas Norte, Veladero, and Pierina mines until March 31, 2018.\nAverage production over the next five years is expected to increase primarily due to continued production growth from both Peñasquito and Constancia. At Peñasquito, grades are expected to increase over the next several years and the PLP, which should increase recoveries, is scheduled to be commissioned later in 2018. At Constancia, Hudbay expects to begin mining the Pampacancha deposit in the second half of 2018, which has significantly higher precious metals grades than what is currently being mined; however, should the mining of the Pampacancha deposit be delayed, Wheaton will be entitled to an increased portion of gold from Hudbay. And lastly, as a reminder, Wheaton does not include any production from Barrick's Pascua-Lama project or Hudbay's Rosemont project in its estimated average five-year production guidance.\nAttributable mine-by-mine actual 2016 and 2017 production and forecast 2018 production are as follows:\nAttributable Production 1, 2\n2016\nActual\n2017\nActual\n2018\nForecast\nSilver ounces produced (000's)\nPeñasquito\n5,034\n6,024\n6,500\nSan Dimas 3, 4\n5,212\n3,963\n1,000\nAntamina\n6,796\n6,554\n5,300\nConstancia 5\n2,759\n2,374\n2,800\nOther 6\n10,578\n9,731\n6,900\nTotal silver ounces\n30,379\n28,646\n22,500\nGold ounces produced (000's)\nSalobo\n228.7\n264.7\n240\nSudbury 7\n42.6\n33.7\n33\nConstancia 5\n14.9\n10.2\n17\nSan Dimas 3,8\n30\nOther 9\n80.1\n46.5\n35\nTotal gold ounces\n366.4\n355.1\n355\n1)\nOunces produced represent quantity of silver and gold contained in concentrate or doré prior to smelting or refining deductions.\n2)\nProduction figures are based on information provided by the operators of the mining operations to which the silver or gold interests relate or management estimates in those situations where other information is not available.\n3)\nGuidance for San Dimas assumes that the proposed acquisition by First Majestic of Primero is completed and that the new precious metals purchase agreement with First Majestic is effective April 1, 2018.\n4)\nUnder the existing silver purchase agreement with Primero, Primero will deliver a per annum amount to Wheaton equal to the first 6 million ounces of payable silver produced at San Dimas and 50% of any excess. Wheaton assumes only one quarter of attributable silver production from San Dimas from Primero in its 2018 production guidance.\n5)\nConstancia silver and gold production guidance for 2018 assumes the expected start of mining at the Pampacancha deposit in 2018.\n6)\nIncludes the Yauliyacu, Los Filos, Zinkgruvan, Cozamin, Neves-Corvo, Stratoni, Minto, 777, Lagunas Norte, Pierina, and Veladero silver interests. The Cozamin precious metal purchase agreement expired on April 4, 2017.\n7)\nComprised of the operating Coleman, Copper Cliff, Garson, Creighton and Totten gold interests, the non-operating Victor gold interest and the Stobie gold interest which was placed into care and maintenance during the second quarter of 2017.\n8)\nUnder the proposed precious metals purchase agreement with First Majestic, San Dimas attributable gold production for 2018 is calculated based on three quarters of production of which Wheaton is entitled to 25% of gold production plus an additional amount of gold equal to 25% of silver production converted to gold at a fixed gold to silver exchange ratio of 70:1 from the San Dimas mine.\n9)\nIncludes Minto and 777 gold interests.\nDividend\nFirst Quarterly Dividend\nThe first quarterly cash dividend for 2018 of US$0.09 will be paid to holders of record of Wheaton Precious Metals common shares as of the close of business on April 6, 2018, and will be distributed on or about April 20, 2018.\nUnder the Company's dividend policy, the quarterly dividend per common share will be equal to 30% of the average cash generated by operating activities in the previous four quarters divided by the Company's then outstanding common shares, all rounded to the nearest cent.\nThe declaration, timing, amount and payment of future dividends remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors. This dividend qualifies as an 'eligible dividend' for Canadian income tax purposes.\nDividend Reinvestment Plan\nThe Company has previously implemented a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (\"DRIP\"). Participation in the DRIP is optional.

There can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate and even if events or results described in the forward-looking statements are realized or substantially realized, there can be no assurance that they will have the expected consequences to, or effects on, Wheaton. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements and are cautioned that actual outcomes may vary. The forward-looking statements included herein are for the purpose of providing investors with information to assist them in understanding Wheaton's expected financial and operational performance and may not be appropriate for other purposes. Any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Wheaton does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements that are included or incorporated by reference herein, except in accordance with applicable securities laws.\nCautionary Language Regarding Reserves And Resources\nFor further information on Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources and on Wheaton more generally, readers should refer to Wheaton's Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2017 and other continuous disclosure documents filed by Wheaton since January 1, 2018, available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . Wheaton's Mineral Reserves and Mineral Resources are subject to the qualifications and notes set forth therein. Mineral Resources which are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.\nCautionary Note to United States Investors Concerning Estimates of Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resources: The information contained herein has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the securities laws in effect in Canada, which differ from the requirements of United States securities laws. The terms \"mineral reserve\", \"proven mineral reserve\" and \"probable mineral reserve\" are Canadian mining terms defined in accordance with Canadian National Instrument 43-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (the \"CIM\") – CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended (the \"CIM Standards\"). These definitions differ from the definitions in Industry Guide 7 (\"SEC Industry Guide 7\") under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"U.S. Securities Act\"). Under U.S. standards, mineralization may not be classified as a \"reserve\" unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made. Also, under SEC Industry Guide 7 standards, a \"final\" or \"bankable\" feasibility study is required to report reserves, the three-year historical average price is used in any reserve or cash flow analysis to designate reserves and the primary environmental analysis or report must be filed with the appropriate governmental authority. In addition, the terms \"mineral resource\", \"measured mineral resource\", \"indicated mineral resource\" and \"inferred mineral resource\" are defined in and required to be disclosed by NI 43-101; however, these terms are not defined terms under SEC Industry Guide 7 and are normally not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. Investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves. \"Inferred mineral resources\" have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category. Under Canadian rules, estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre-feasibility studies, except in rare cases. Investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable. Mineral resources that are not mineral reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Disclosure of \"contained ounces\" in a resource is permitted disclosure under Canadian regulations; however, the SEC normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute \"reserves\" by SEC standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures. Accordingly, information contained herein that describes Wheaton's mineral deposits may not be comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies subject to reporting and disclosure requirements under the United States federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. United States investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in Wheaton's Form 40-F, a copy of which may be obtained from Wheaton or from http://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml .\nIn accordance with the Company's MD&A and financial statements, reference to the Company includes the Company's wholly owned subsidiaries.\nSOURCE Wheaton Precious Metals Corp.",
