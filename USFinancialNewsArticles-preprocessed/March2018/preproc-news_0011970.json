    "text": "MOSCOW, March 5 (Reuters) - Over 80 percent of the loans issued by Peresvet, the bank previously controlled by the Russian Orthodox Church, could be written off, the annual report of its new owner showed on Monday.\nRussian Regional Development Bank (RRDB), owned by oil producer Rosneft, took over Peresvet last year via a bail in.\nIt said in its report that out of 165 billion roubles ($2.9 billion) in loans, 138 billion roubles worth could potentially not be repaid.\nThe Russian central bank provided RRDB with a 93 billion rouble loan at a favourable rate to be used to help rehabilitate Peresvet.\nIn addition, a number of large depositors funds were converted into Peresvet subordinated bonds.\nThe central bank declined to comment. RRDB and Rosneft did not reply to a Reuters request for immediate comment.\n($1 = 57.1200 roubles)\nReporting by Tatiana Voronova; additional reporting by Olesya Astakhova; writing by Katya Golubkova; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
