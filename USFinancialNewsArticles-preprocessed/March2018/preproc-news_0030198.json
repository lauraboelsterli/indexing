    "text": "Andrew McCabe — the former FBI deputy director just fired by the attorney general — kept personal memos regarding President Donald Trump .\nThat's according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation who wasn't authorized to discuss the memos publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\nThis person says the memos are similar to the ones maintained by former FBI Director James Comey, who Trump fired last May.\nComey's series of notes detailed interactions with Trump that Comey said unnerved him.\nThe person with knowledge of McCabe's situation says McCabe's memos include details of interactions with the president, among other topics.\nIt was not immediately clear whether any of the McCabe memos had been turned over to special counsel Robert Mueller or requested by Mueller.\nHowever, CNN is reporting that McCabe's memos are now in Mueller's hands , according to a person familiar with the matter.",
