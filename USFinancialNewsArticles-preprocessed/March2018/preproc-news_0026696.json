As a result, our operating margin improved in 2017. We will continue to monitor our cash flow management to strengthen our balance sheet.\"\n2017 Fourth Quarter Results\nRevenue for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 was RMB736.3 million (US$113.2 million) from RMB 591.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in revenue on a year-over-year basis was mainly driven by increased demand for new trucks, especially heavy- and medium-duty trucks, due to the combined effects of the Government's anti-overloading policy and increased development of infrastructure and residential properties in China.\nAftermarket sales in China decreased by 5.2% year-over-year to RMB235.4 million (US$36.2 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB248.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Total unit sales in the aftermarket decreased by 27.3% year-over-year while prices increased. The aftermarket wheel segment remained weak as higher OEM truck sales negatively affected aftermarket replacement volume.\nSales to the Chinese OEM market increased by 55.6% year-over-year to RMB397.9 million (US$61.2 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to RMB255.7 million in the same quarter of 2016. Total unit sales in the OEM market increased by 7.4% year-over-year as a result of continued truck sales growth, especially heavy- and medium-duty trucks, during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nInternational sales increased by 17.2% year-over-year to RMB102.9 million (US$15.8 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to sales of RMB 87.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Total unit volume in international sales decreased by 7.1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter of 2017 as weaker demand in the price sensitive regions such as Southeast Asia, negatively affected overall sales.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, domestic aftermarket sales, domestic OEM sales and international sales contributed 32.0%, 54.0% and 14.0% of revenue, respectively.\nSales of tubed steel wheels comprised 44.3% of 2017 fourth quarter revenue compared to 52.4% in the same quarter in 2016. Tubeless steel wheel sales represented 43.2% of 2017 fourth quarter revenue compared to 35.4% in the same quarter of 2016. Tubed and tubeless steel wheel sales remained the main sources of revenue for the Company. However, sales of aluminum wheels continued to increase and accounted for 8.1% of fourth quarter revenue as compared to 7.9% in the same quarter a year ago.\nFourth quarter gross profit increased by 22.1% to RMB108.5 million (US$16.7 million), compared to RMB 88.8 million in the same quarter in 2016. Gross margin was 14.7%, compared with 15.0% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in gross margin on a year-over-year basis was mainly driven by the significant price appreciation of raw materials, namely steel, which slightly outpaced Zenix Auto's wheel price increases.\nSelling and distribution expenses decreased by 9.4% to RMB41.1 million (US$6.3 million) from RMB45.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. As a percentage of revenue, selling and distribution costs were reduced to 5.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 7.7% in the same quarter a year ago.\nResearch and development (\"R&D\") expenses decreased by 34.1% to RMB15.5 million (US$2.4 million), compared to RMB23.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. R&D as a percentage of revenue was 2.1% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 4.0% in same quarter of 2016.\nAdministrative expenses remained flat at RMB 34.4 million (US$5.3 million) from RMB34.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. However, as a percentage of revenue, administrative expenses were 4.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 5.8% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet profit and total comprehensive income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB9.5 million (US$1.5 million), compared to net loss and total comprehensive loss of RMB11.6 million in the same quarter of 2016.\nBasic and diluted earnings per ADS in the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB 0.18 (US$0.03) compared to basic and diluted loss per ADS of RMB0.23 in the same quarter of 2016.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded net cash outflows from operating activities of RMB41.8 million (US$6.4 million). Capital expenditures for the purchase of property, plant and equipment in the fourth quarter were RMB0.4 million (US$0.1 million).\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, the weighted average number of ordinary shares was 206.5 million and the weighted average number of ADSs was 51.6 million.\n2017 Full Year Results\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 grew 25.8% to RMB2,831.0 million (US$435.1 million) compared with RMB2,249.5 million in 2016.\nAftermarket sales decreased by 10.9% to RMB909.9 million (US$139.9 million) in 2017 and represented 32.1% of total revenue. Sales to the Chinese OEM market increased by 78.9% to RMB1,533.0 million (US$235.6 million) and represented 54.2% of total revenue. International sales increased by 4.4% to RMB388.0 million (US$ 59.6 million) compared to last year and represented 13.7% of total revenue.\nTubed steel wheel sales in 2017 accounted for 45.4% of revenue compared with 54.6% in 2016. Tubeless steel wheel sales accounted for 43.9% of revenue compared with 36.4% in 2016. With the increase in market acceptance, aluminum wheel sales accounted for 6.8% of revenue in 2017 compared with 4.6% in 2016.\nGross profit for year 2017 was RMB381.6 million (US$58.6 million), compared with RMB 387.5 million in 2016. Gross margin was 13.5% in 2017 as compared to 17.2% in 2016.\nNet profit and total comprehensive income for full year 2017 was RMB9.1 million (US$1.4 million), compared with net loss and total comprehensive loss of RMB25.9 million in 2016.
