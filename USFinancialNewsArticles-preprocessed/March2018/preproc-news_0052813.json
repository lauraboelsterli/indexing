    "text": "NEW YORK, March 27 (Reuters) - Overall demand at a $35 billion U.S. five-year Treasury note auction on Tuesday increased to its strongest level in six months, resulting in a yield of 2.612 percent on the latest five-year issue, Treasury data showed.\nThe ratio of bids to the amount of five-year notes offered was 2.50, which was the highest level since the five-year auction last September. This gauge on auction demand was 2.44 at the previous five-year note sale in February. (Reporting by Richard Leong Editing by Susan Thomas)\n ",
