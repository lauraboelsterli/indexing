Furthermore, we approached the high end of our revenue guidance while exceeding our Adjusted EBITDA 1 guidance as our model yielded higher leverage on the heels of a strong second half of the year.\"\nMr. Swayze continued, \"Looking ahead to 2018, we remain committed to driving shareholder value as our markets seek improved customer experience through mobile tools that provide greater engagement and transparency for policyholders. Our ability to quickly integrate partner applications and datasets enables us to scale our business and drive customer efficiencies with only nominal incremental cost.

Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure that facilitates period-to-period operating comparisons. Adjusted EBITDA does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and is not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings (loss) prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by IASB. All other financial measures referenced herein have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards unless stated otherwise.\n2 In Canadian dollars, rounded to the nearest cent.\nINVESTOR CONFERENCE CALL\nSymbility will host a live webcast and conference call today, Thursday, March 29, 2018, at 11 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss these results.
