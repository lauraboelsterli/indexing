Alibaba’s Tmall and Taobao platforms dominate China’s e-commerce market and it has a highly popular digital wallet Alipay.\n“Alibaba has got almost 500 million qualified customers on Taobao platform, so the idea is we can use Taobao to push our online and offline businesses,” Holinier said during an earnings call on Monday.\nAt the end of 2017, Sun Art operated 461 stores across China, most of these in smaller cities. It plans to open 35 more in 2018.\nShares in Sun Art ended down 9.7 percent on Monday, their lowest close since Feb. 12, giving it a market value of $11.8 billion.
