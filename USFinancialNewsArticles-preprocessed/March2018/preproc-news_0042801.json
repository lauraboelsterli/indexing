    "text": "NEW YORK and CAESAREA, Israel, March 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- DarioHealth Corp. (NASDAQ: DRIO), a leading global digital health company with mobile health and big data solutions, announced today that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Pre-market Notification (510(k)) clearance for the Company's Lightning®-enabled version of the acclaimed Dario™ Blood Glucose Monitoring System which enables the use of the Dario app on iPhone 7, 8 and X smart mobile devices (SMD). Consumers in the U.S. market will be able to receive the same quality user experience with DarioHealth on the latest Apple devices, including the iPhone X.\nThe launch of Apple's smartphones with only a Lightning connector posed a unique challenge to the entire mobile ecosystem. With today's announcement, DarioHealth can now successfully offer to U.S. consumers its proprietary meter with either a 3.5mm headphone jack or Lightning connector.\nThis news opens a significant U.S. market opportunity for DarioHealth, as it enables DarioHealth to provide its diabetes management platform and expand the sales of the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System to iPhone 7, 8 and X SMDs.\nErez Raphael, Chairman and CEO of DarioHealth, commented: \"We've been working tirelessly to bring forth a solution that would meet the rigorous standards required to achieve the FDA clearance. We are proud that our organization worked with agility to ensure connectivity to the latest Apple devices. This is a big breakthrough to receive the FDA's marketing clearance for the Dario product on iPhone 7, 8 and X, and allows many of our past users who upgraded to these new iPhones to renew their Dario experience. This continues DarioHealth's U.S. market progress, and truly opens the door for wide-scale expansion in this pivotal market. Of course, this milestone is a testament to our superb teamwork, and I am proud of the hard work and success that our talented team has achieved.\"\nDarioHealth has been marketing the product in the U.S. exclusively for Apple iOS 6.1 platform and higher since the FDA first granted clearance for the Dario Blood Glucose Monitoring System in December 2015, and certain leading Android SMD's including Samsung Galaxy S series, Samsung Galaxy Note series, and LG G series, since September 2017. With today's news, DarioHealth plans to expand U.S. sales in the coming weeks.\nAbout DarioHealth Corp.\nDarioHealth Corp. (NASDAQ: DRIO) is a leading global digital health company serving its users with dynamic mobile health solutions. In today's day and age, knowledge of health and treatment is being democratized, and we believe people deserve to know everything about their own health and have the best tools to manage their condition. DarioHealth employs a revolutionary approach whereby harnessing big data, we have developed a novel method for chronic disease data management, empowering people to analyze and personalize self-diabetes management in a totally new way without having the disease slow them down.
