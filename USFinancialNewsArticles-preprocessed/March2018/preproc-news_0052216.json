The deal came in part because the two allies have a bigger common challenge ahead in disarming North Korea, the WSJ’s Kwanwoo Jun writes, but it also sets a potential framework for other negotiations the U.S. has underway or may be coming in the future. One trade expert in Seoul says the new deal provides an “exemplary case” for Canada and Mexico to follow, for instance, in renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement. Seoul officials say they made only “modest” concessions, and the deal is unlikely to shift trans-Pacific trade flows much if at all. U.S. auto makers appear to be the biggest winners, for instance, getting sharply higher quotas for exports to South Korea. But the car makers are nowhere near reaching even the current quota. South Korea also won a permanent exemption to new U.S. steel tariffs, demonstrating the tariffs will likely be on the table in negotiations with other countries.\nKansas City Southern ’s KSU -2.30% focus on international transport may prove costly under the new U.S. tax law. A provision in the law aimed at overseas income earned by U.S. technology and pharmaceutical firms is hitting some unexpected companies, the WSJ’s Richard Rubin report, potentially including KCS freight rail operations that lean heavily on U.S.-Mexico trade . KCS says the new minimum tax will cost the company $25 million annually, the result of a measure aimed at trademarks and patents held by tech and pharma firms. KCS’s assets are railcars, not patents, but the provision resets the math on foreign tax credits that companies use to calculate the taxes they pay abroad, and hits companies in high-tax countries—like Mexico. It’s a quirk of the new tax code, and it comes with another twist: U.S. companies could lessen the impact by transferring some spending to a foreign country, and out of the U.S.\nChina’s automotive supply chain is getting much more global. Volvo Cars plans to start producing sport-utility vehicles for the business it jointly owns with Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co., the WSJ’s William Boston reports, the latest step by the Chinese company to take its Geely Auto business international . Under the new plan, Sweden-based Volvo will produce vehicles at a plant in Belgium for Lynk & Co, the business launched last year under Volvo and Zhejiang Geely. The new operation follows the announcement last month that the owner of Zhejiang Geely Holding had amassed a nearly 10% stake in Germany’s Daimler AG, the owner of Mercedes-Benz cars, and it extends the technology and operational tie-ups that are pushing the Chinese auto maker onto the bigger international stage. Volvo will use technology it developed for its own compact SUV in the new Lynk vehicle, saving on costs and allowing the company to ramp up production quickly.\nSUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES South Korea’s Port of Pyeongtaek-Dangjin. Photo: Bloomberg News Sometimes suppliers just have to draw a line. Newell Brands Inc., the maker of Sharpie markers and Paper Mate pens, has been fighting in the aisles with Office Depot Inc., ODP -2.34% contending the office-supply store wasn’t doing enough to showcase its products and even pulling back shipments to the retailer over the past year. The WSJ’s Sharon Terlep reports the impact hit Newell’s fourth-quarter sales, triggered a string of director resignations and drew interest from activist investors. It’s the latest and perhaps most extreme example of the fraying relations between vendors and store operators in a fast-changing retail environment. Office-supply outlets are increasingly under pressure as customers head online to buy staples, cutting into foot traffic and sales of other products. Historically, retailers and manufacturers have worked together to bolster sales. But conflicts are growing as retailers lower prices to win back shoppers from Amazon and other online sellers.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ In our industry, there is no way to make any abrupt, larger-scale short-term movements. You have a footprint, you have contracts, you have a supply base, you have capacity. ’\n—Frank Witter, Volkswagen AG chief financial officer, on automotive supply chains .\nNumber of the Day 90% Year-over-year increase in February in average charter rates for capesize shipping vessels, the largest in the dry-bulk market, according to Alphabulk.\nIN OTHER NEWS The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago’s measure of U.S. economic growth rose at a sharp rate in February .
