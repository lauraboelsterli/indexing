    "text": "March 6, 2018 / 9:53 AM / Updated an hour ago Peugeot boss demands government commitments on electric-car charging networks Reuters Staff 2 Min Read GENEVA (Reuters) - PSA Group ( PEUP.PA ) boss Carlos Tavares said he will introduce demands that EU governments commit to develop electric-car networks in exchange for previously agreed CO2 emissions goals taking effect in 2020-21, backed by heavy fines. FILE PHOTO: Carlos Tavares, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of PSA Group, attends a news conference to announce the company's 2017 annual results at their headquarter in Rueil-Malmaison, near Paris, France, March 1, 2018. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier In what could be the start of a pushback against the agreed carbon emissions targets by the main ACEA European carmakers’ lobby, Tavares - who currently chairs the ACEA - said he would propose the new demands to its board this week. “I think it’s only logical that there should be commitments from governments,” Tavares told reporters at the Geneva auto show. The potential suspension of penalties if charging network rollouts fall short of targets is “to be discussed”, he added. In a newspaper interview last week, Tavares suggested carmakers should not be fined for non-compliance if the density of electric-car charging networks remained inadequate. The accelerating decline of diesel, long used by carmakers to boost fuel-efficiency, is undermining carmakers’ efforts to meet the looming CO2 goals and avoid big penalties.
