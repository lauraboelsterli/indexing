    "text": "8 COMMENTS Connecticut State Treasurer Denise Nappier said the state is open to selling public pension funds’ positions in firearm manufacturers if the companies don’t take measures to curb gun use by dangerous people.\nThe move is a sign major investors are reassessing their ties to the firearms industry after a February school shooting in Parkland, Fla. reopened a national debate on gun control.\nThis week, Connecticut State Senator Gayle Slossberg asked the treasurer to produce information on whether the state’s pension pool is invested in gun makers and how it would go about exiting those holdings\n“I am in the process of fortifying our efforts in the corporate boardrooms of our portfolio companies that manufacture guns,” Ms. Nappier wrote in a letter released in response.\nIf the state fails to push the businesses to take preventive steps to stop firearm misuse, Connecticut is open to divesting or halting investments in gun companies, Ms. Nappier said.\nThe statement marks the first time the Connecticut state treasurer, who oversees roughly $34 billion in pension and public trust funds, has threatened to divest its gun holdings.\nConnecticut, as of Feb. 26, had roughly $16.5 million—about 0.05%—of the pool in stock and fixed income holdings across five gun manufacturers, including chemical and ammunition maker Olin Corp. , defense company Orbital ATK Inc. and sports and tactical gear provider Vista Outdoor Inc.\nAfter the December 2012 Sandy Hook shooting in Newtown, Conn., the state treasurer’s office opened talks with businesses it backed that were involved in making or distributing guns. It asked the companies to take a series of measures to prevent the misuse of firearms.\nThose engagement efforts delivered mixed results: Not all the gun manufacturers it contacted responded. The pension investor said that discussions with some companies, including retailers such as Amazon.com Inc. , were constructive.\nConnecticut joins other public pensions that are taking a page from Wall Street activists’ playbooks by engaging with companies to influence how they are run and in several cases, participating in proxy fights.\nThe Sandy Hook shooting, which involved a firearm made by a business owned by Cerberus Capital Management LP, prompted investors to pressure the private-equity shop to give them an early exit route. Cerberus found a way to separate the business , now known as Remington Outdoors Co. , from funds that invested in it.\nLeadership changes at pensions can affect the momentum of these efforts. Ms. Nappier announced at the start of this year that she will not seek reelection, and plans to end a two-decade tenure as Connecticut’s state treasurer in 2019.\nPublic pensions, often the target of political pressure, increasingly invest with an eye toward the public scrutiny that can come with exposure to certain companies or industries. They also face criticism that holding stakes, even small ones, in firearms makers could make them complicit in gun violence.\nBut some pensions, particularly ones that manage assets for police officers or military personnel, often feel they must strike a careful balance in their approach.\nIn the letter detailing the pension funds’ holdings, Ms. Nappier said the firearms industry “provides weapons that enhance the safety and protection of our communities by our military and law enforcement” but also “places dangerous firearms into the hands of those that misuse them.”\nWrite to Dawn Lim at dawn.lim@wsj.com",
