    "text": "Home / FOOD / Strawberry Jam: Athletes Get Stuck in International Food Fight Strawberry Jam: Athletes Get Stuck in International Food Fight 5 hours ago FOOD , tokyo food \nAOMORI, Japan—The finest strawberries from all over Japan were stacked high at a sports center here on Tuesday: the Super Deluxe Tochigi Maiden, Red Cheeks, the Skyberry and the world’s heaviest, the Sweet King. \n“So sweet!” said Olympic curler \nSatsuki Fujisawa \nas she took a bite from one while cameras flashed from the assembled media at the event ahead of a tournament. \nOnce again, she carried the weight of national pride on her shoulders. \nJust last month, Ms. Fujisawa and the Japanese women’s curling team had won a bronze medal at the Games, but during the competition, they had praised Korean strawberries as a midgame snack. \nTo some ears back home, the words were equivalent to blowing a raspberry. Japanese stores sell at least a dozen homegrown varieties of the fruit, all with different qualities of sweetness, texture, color and size, including the Scent of First Love, which is white but still sweet, and the Love Berry, which is as big as a child’s hand and very juicy. \nFruit relations are prickly because farmers say Korean berries are actually Japanese varieties caught up in a bruising trade dispute. \n“Korean strawberries are based on leaks of Japanese seeds,” \nKen Saito, \nJapan’s agriculture minister, said at a press conference after the Games. “I’d like our curling team to eat tasty Japanese strawberries.” \nJapan has stewed about the alleged berry skulduggery for a few years, but after a curling team member declared Korean strawberries “surprisingly delicious” at an Olympic press conference, temperatures escalated. \nOnline chat sites popular with Japanese nationalists buzzed. “Of course they’re delicious; they’re Japanese!” wrote one commenter. \n“$200 Million in Losses From Plagiarized Korean Strawberries,” declared one magazine headline, referring to a government estimate of the total lost revenue for Japanese strawberry exports over five years. \nThe Japan Curling Association moved quickly to shield the team. It declined to make the players available to talk about strawberries, adding that criticism of them online for not knowing the origins of the fruit was unfair. “How many of you [journalists] knew about it?” an association spokesman said. \nIn South Korea, media went into overdrive to squash Japan’s complaints. “Japan is making something out of nothing,” an anchor for TV Chosun, the broadcasting arm of one of South Korea’s largest newspapers, said on a news show. An official at the strawberry division of a state-run seed developer said a wave of phone calls from the press had made it “impossible to conduct normal work.” \nThe South Korean agriculture ministry declined to comment, citing diplomatic sensitivities over the issue. It pointed to a March 8 press release in which it acknowledged that over 80% of South Korean strawberries produced up to 2005 had been based on Japanese seeds. Now, it said, 93% of South Korean strawberries are grown from locally developed seeds. \nFood fights world-wide in recent years have included a legal dispute between Israel and Lebanon over ownership of hummus, the chickpea paste. The governments of Peru and Chile have traded barbs over which country dug the first potato out of the ground 10,000 years ago. And Australia and New Zealand have clashed over which has the closer association to Pavlova, a meringue-based dessert named after lighter-than-air performances of Russian ballet dancer Anna Pavlova in the antipodes in the 1920s. \nJapan and South Korea have had previous diplomatic gastro-tension. South Korea cried foul when Japan tried to register a version of the Korean national dish of kimchi, a type of garlicky, peppery, pungent pickled cabbage, as an official Japanese food at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. \nSome culinary overlap is inevitable for the Asian neighbors, which have developed much in common over centuries of trade, conflict, colonization, and religious and cultural exchanges. The countries are allies in efforts to denuclearize North Korea but have clashed in recent years over the treatment of Korean women forced to work in Tokyo’s military brothels in World War II. \nThe berry flap comes as Japan is increasingly sensitive about competition from South Korea, which has eroded or wiped out Japan’s advantage in major industries such as electronics and autos. Even Korea’s K-Pop music has grabbed international attention from Japan’s teenage heartthrobs. At the Games, the South Korean women’s curling team bested Japan in a nail-biter, eventually taking the silver medal. (Sweden won gold.) \nThe Japanese take fruit very seriously. Luxury fruit shops display gorgeously wrapped, expensive specimens ready to present as gifts—domestic muskmelons, for example, are traditionally exchanged during gift-giving seasons at midyear and year-end. \nPears and apples are also popular, and last year, a bunch of grapes set a new national record of around $10,000 at auction. At Sembikiya, a fruit seller in central Tokyo, a box of the biggest strawberries this week sells for $6.75—per berry. \nJapan’s strawberry exports totaled just under $17 million last year, while South Korean exports reached $44 million, according to government figures in each country. South Korea more than tripled exports between 2000 and 2014, mainly to other Asian nations where Japan was once the dominant supplier. \nKorean fruit generally isn’t available in Japan. \nKozo Honma, \na 67-year-old pensioner shopping at a supermarket in Tokyo, said he wouldn’t buy Korean strawberries if they became available there. “Unless the copyright issue is cleared, I wouldn’t buy them even if they were half the price of Japanese strawberries,” he said. \nThe dispute originated in the 1990s, when both countries say seeds of two Japanese varieties—the Red Pearl and Akihime—were taken to South Korea. It isn’t clear who imported them, but Japanese plants quickly became popular for their high yields and sweet fruit. \nFarmers in Japan couldn’t grow the two varieties without licensing the rights, but South Korea had no legal protection for plant products at the time. In 2002, South Korea signed an international treaty that allowed foreign farmers to register their original products for similar protections in Korea, starting in 2012. But after the treaty was signed, local farmers developed hybrids from the original Japanese varieties and registered them as new types of strawberry. \nKazuhiro Hagiwara, a co-developer of Akihime strawberries, said that instead of royalties on his seeds, South Korean growers offered him $10,000, a trip to South Korea and a trophy to recognize his role in the emergence of the Korean strawberry industry. He said he turned them down. \nTsutomu Imura, \na Japanese official in charge of copyright for vegetables and fruits in Tochigi, the country’s best known strawberry growing prefecture, was happy to see the curling players eating strawberries during the Olympics—but disappointed when he learned they were eating Korean fruit. \nStill, he said it shouldn’t be the source of a dispute. Strawberries have been grown in Japan only since the mid-19th century, from seeds brought from Holland. “Japanese strawberries are not originally from Japan, either,” he said. —Andrew Jeong in Seoul contributed to this article. \nWrite to Alastair Gale at alastair.gale@wsj.com and Miho Inada at miho.inada@wsj.com",
