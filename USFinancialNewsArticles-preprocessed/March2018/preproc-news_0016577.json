He also oversaw certain operations in Texas.\nAdditionally, Lenderking served as chairman for West Valley Water Association (formerly WESTCAPS), a collaboration of West Valley municipal and private water providers, where he led a number of member agencies to plan and implement the use of renewable water supplies. He also served on the Arizona Department of Water Resources’ (ADWR) Modified Non-Per Capita Conservation Program Steering Committee, as well as served on ADWR’s Statewide Water Advisory Group to assist in statewide water policy formation.\nEarlier, Lenderking served as water resource specialist for the City of Phoenix Water Services Department, where he was responsible for water resources and water conservation, and oversaw the implementation of the city’s Residential Retrofit Program.\nHe began his career at the Arizona Department of Water Resources’ Phoenix Active Management Area, where he climbed the ranks to water resource specialist III and was later promoted to Water Resource Specialist IV Recharge Team Leader.\nLenderking holds a Global MBA from Thunderbird School of Global Management in Glendale, Arizona, and holds a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Resources from Arizona State University.\nAbout Global Water Resources\nGlobal Water Resources, Inc. is a leading water resource management company that owns and operates nine utility companies which provide water, wastewater and recycled water services.
