    "text": "NEW YORK, March 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (“Checkpoint”) (NASDAQ:CKPT), a clinical-stage, immuno-oncology biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel treatments for patients with solid tumor cancers, today announced financial results and recent corporate highlights for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nJames F. Oliviero, President and Chief Executive Officer of Checkpoint, said, “Checkpoint achieved significant financial and pipeline-related milestones in 2017. Most notably, our common stock began trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market in June 2017, and in October, we announced the dosing of the first patient in our Phase 1 trial of our anti-PD-L1 antibody, CK-301. In addition, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to our third-generation EGFR inhibitor, CK-101, for the treatment of EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer. As we enter 2018, we believe we are well-positioned to generate initial efficacy data from our clinical trials in support of our planned registration studies to commence in 2019.”\nFinancial Results:\nCash Position : As of December 31, 2017, Checkpoint’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $19.2 million, compared to $35.1 million at December 31, 2016, a decrease of $15.9 million. On a non-GAAP basis, pro-forma cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 (excluding first quarter 2018 operations) totaled approximately $40.1 million, after giving effect to $20.9 million of net proceeds from an underwritten public offering during March 2018. R&D Expenses : Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $19.1 million, compared to $20.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $1.2 million. G&A Expenses : General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $5.4 million, compared to $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $0.9 million. Net Loss : Net loss attributable to common stock holders for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $22.7 million, or $1.00 per share, compared to a net loss of $22.5 million, or $1.04 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n2017 and Recent Corporate Highlights:\nIn February 2017, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a composition of matter patent for CK-101, an oral, third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”) inhibitor in development for the treatment of EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”). In June 2017, Checkpoint’s common stock began trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker symbol “CKPT.” In September 2017, Checkpoint announced that the U. S. Food and Drug Administration granted Orphan Drug Designation to CK-101 for the treatment of EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. In October 2017, Checkpoint announced the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of CK-301, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in checkpoint therapy-naïve patients with selected recurrent or metastatic cancers. In March 2018, Checkpoint completed an underwritten public offering that raised net proceeds of $20.9 million.\nAbout Checkpoint Therapeutics\nCheckpoint Therapeutics, Inc.
