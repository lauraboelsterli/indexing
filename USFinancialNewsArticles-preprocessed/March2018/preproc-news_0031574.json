    "text": "Published: Mar 16, 2018 9:09 a.m. ET Share \nOne raid was in the Seoul neighborhood of Yeouido, home to Coinone, one of the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges Reuters The South Korean won was last year’s fourth most-used currency in bitcoin trading after the U.S. dollar, the Japanese yen and the euro, according to CryptoCompare. \nBy Eun-Young Jeong \nSEOUL—Prosecutors last month raided three cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea’s capital, after a January government investigation revealed that a portion of customers’ assets had been transferred to private bank accounts belonging to top managers at the exchanges. \nThey carried out the three-day raid and confiscated items including computer hard disks, financial transaction records, mobile phones and accounting records, Jeong Dae-jeong, the case’s head prosecutor, said Friday. The raid comes as the government continues to grapple with how to regulate virtual currencies in one of the world’s most frenetic crypto markets. \nRead: Bitcoin and cryptocurrency on Twitter: The most important people to follow \n“It’s unclear yet whether the transactions can be seen as embezzlement,” Jeong said. He didn’t disclose the total amount of the transferred funds, or specify which exchanges were under investigation. One, he added, is located in the Seoul neighborhood of Yeouido, home to Coinone, one of the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. \nInvestigations have since the raid found that customers’ assets were used by at least one of the exchanges to purchase bitcoin from competitors. \nThe Korea Blockchain Association, an industry group involving over 30 local exchanges, didn’t respond to requests for comment on the raid.",
