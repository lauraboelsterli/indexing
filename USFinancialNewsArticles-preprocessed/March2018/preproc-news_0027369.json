    "text": "NEW YORK, March 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Open Road Integrated Media (OR/M), a digital media company, announced today the acquisition of US ebook rights to 27 titles by renowned British novelist Graham Greene that have never before been published in ebook form in the United States. The titles include all of his iconic works, such as The End of the Affair , The Quiet American , and The Power and the Glory (available today March 13, 2018), to be followed by The Heart of the Matter, Brighton Rock, Travels with my Aunt, and others (available April 10, 2018), with more than fifteen additional titles to be published throughout the year.\nRights were acquired for Open Road by Charlotte Greig in the UK and Philip Rappaport in New York, with Amelia Atlas at ICM Partners in New York and Anthony Goff of David Higham in the UK representing the Greene Estate.\n\"With literally tens of millions of copies of his works sold in countless languages, Graham Greene is unquestionably one of the finest writers of his—or any other—generation, and we are thrilled to bring his remarkable oeuvre to readers in the United States for the first time digitally,\" said Jon P. Fine, Senior Vice President and Publisher. \"Open Road's unrivaled ability to build and reach audiences in the digital marketplace uniquely positions us to strengthen and extend Greene's already extraordinary influence over readers old and new.\"\nAbout Graham Greene\nFew writers have achieved the level of both literary acclaim and commercial success that marked Graham Greene's career. A keen observer of the political and moral intrigues and ambiguities of life in the modern world, his work remains remarkably trenchant and relevant today. For John le Carré, \"Greene had wit and grace and character and story and a transcendent universal compassion that places him for all time in the ranks of world literature.\"\nBorn in 1904, Greene attended Oxford before becoming a journalist, a role that fueled his extensive global travels for much of his adult life, affording him the opportunity to research the exotic and volatile settings for many of his most admired novels. Greene was also active in the world of film, first as a critic and then as a screenwriter, most notably as author of The Third Man. Greene was a member of the Order of Merit and a Companion of Honour. He died in 1991 at the age of eighty-six.\nAbout Open Road Integrated Media\nOpen Road Integrated Media is a unique digital media company, with a network of digital properties that deliver compelling content that keeps audiences engaged and growing—across devices and around the world.
