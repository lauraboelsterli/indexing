    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, March 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Conversational commerce continues to be at the forefront of retail innovation. Today, Elliot announces the launch of its new Alexa Skill, which provides its customers the ability to pull business reports instantly through voice commands. Using voice capabilities to conduct complex data queries dramatically accelerates the way retail organizations access information across their sales channels globally.\nElliot's Alexa Skill provides 50 voice-activated search queries so that merchants can quickly ask for top-selling products within certain countries or regions, channel-specific metrics, annual and quarterly growth reports, and more.\n\"Retailers today still pull CSV reports manually and they lose important data in the process. It's slow, inconvenient, and extremely frustrating,\" said Elliot CEO Sergio Villasenor. \"Not to mention all the analytics dashboards, business intelligence tools, and third-party software retail brands currently use… the current workflow for querying business information is downright inefficient.\"\nWith Alexa, Elliot now enables its customers to get insights in real time. This new data channel significantly reduces the time it takes to pull reports and create segments. \"Until today, conversational interfaces have largely been available to end-consumers. With Elliot's new Alexa Skill, we're helping all retailers realize the same value and convenience of conducting complex queries and tasks for their businesses,\" said Villasenor.\nIn addition to launching its Alex Skill, Elliot is also announcing two key hires: Samantha Kent , formerly Vice President, Client Insight & Operations at Flow.io, and Thom Armstrong , former Regional Vice President of Enterprise Sales at Salesforce Commerce Cloud (formerly Demandware).\n\"I am a huge believer in people. Samantha and Thom bring tremendous retail, commerce, and technology experience to Elliot,\" said Villasenor. \"They share our immense passion for creating technologies that will shape the future of global commerce and I'm very excited to have them join the team.\"\nKent will serve as Elliot's President & Head of Product, and Armstrong, the SVP of Global Sales.\nTo view a live demo of Elliot's Alexa integration, stop by Booth #2239 at Shoptalk between March 19 – 21 at the Venetian Exhibition Hall in Las Vegas.\nFor more information visit helloiamelliot.com .\nRelated Video\nhttps://vimeo.com/255844792\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/elliot-enables-voice-for-business-and-hires-top-executives-from-demandware--flowio-300614925.html\nSOURCE Elliot",
