CAS Series 2018-C02, a $1.007 billion note offering, is scheduled to settle on March 14, 2018. CAS is Fannie Mae's benchmark issuance program designed to share credit risk on its single-family conventional guaranty book of business.\n\"We saw strong market reception for our second transaction of 2018, CAS 2018-C02. Through the CAS program alone, we have now transferred a portion of credit risk on over $1 trillion in unpaid principal balance of single-family mortgages since the program began in 2013,\" said Laurel Davis, Fannie Mae's Vice President of Credit Risk Transfer. \"We continue to see a diversified investor base and were pleased to add new investors to the CAS program with this transaction. We expect to return to the market with our next deal during the April-May timeframe, subject to market conditions.\"\nThe reference pool for CAS Series 2018-C02 consists of more than 112,000 single-family mortgage loans with an aggregate outstanding unpaid principal balance of approximately $26.5 billion. The loans in this reference pool have original loan-to-value ratios between 80.01 and 97 percent and were acquired from June 2017 through October 2017. The loans included in this transaction are fixed-rate, generally 30-year term, fully amortizing mortgages, and were underwritten using rigorous credit standards and enhanced risk controls.\nFannie Mae will retain a portion of the 2M-1, 2M-2, and 2B-1 tranches in order to align its interests with investors throughout the life of the deal. Fannie Mae will retain the full 2B-2 and 2A-H tranches.\nClass\nOffered Amount\n($MM)\nPricing Level\nExpected\nRating\n2M-1\n$188.817\n1-month Libor plus 65 bps\nBBB-sf from Fitch Ratings and BBB+(sf)\nfrom KBRA\n2M-2\n$667.152\n1-month Libor plus 220 bps\nBsf from Fitch Ratings and B+(sf) from\nKBRA\n2B-1\n$151.053\n1-month Libor plus 400 bps\nThis class will not be rated\nJ.P.
