    "text": "0 COMMENTS Americans over 65 years old will outnumber children in the U.S. by 2035, a first in the nation’s history, according to updated projections released by the Census Bureau on Tuesday.\nThe milestone would be the latest marker of the nation’s aging, which has accelerated with increasing numbers of baby boomers becoming senior citizens and with the recessionary effects on births and on immigration over the last decade.\nAt the same time, while the population is becoming more diverse, the trend is happening more slowly than previously estimated. Whites who are not Hispanic will begin shrinking as a group by 2024 and would drop below half of the population by 2045, but that would be two years later than the bureau estimated just a few years ago.\nBy 2020, less than half of children would be white but not Hispanic.\nThe Census Bureau projects the country’s population would grow to 355 million by 2030, five million less than estimated three years ago. That’s an annual average growth rate of just 0.7%, in line with recent rates but well below historical levels.\nUnlike many European nations, the U.S. would continue to grow, reaching 404 million by 2060. It would rival fast-growing Nigeria as the third most populous, after China and India, according to census and United Nations projections.\nThe projections are the first since 2015. They include revisions to rates on births, deaths and immigration, all of which factor into population growth. The projections assume no major changes in immigration policies.\nAs the nation ages and birthrates remain historically low, immigration looms larger in shaping the future. The bureau projects that by 2030, net immigration would rival natural increase, which is the surplus of births over deaths within the U.S., as a share of population growth. By 2040, immigration would be more than twice as large as the natural increase.\nAs a result, the share of Americans who are foreign-born, now about 13%, is expected to reach a record 14.9% by 2028, topping a mark set in 1850. That share would rise to 17.2% by 2060.\n—Janet Adamy contributed to this article.",
