As president of Pacific Union's Commercial Real Estate division, Pugh will direct the brokerage's commercial business in the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California.\n\"I began my career at Pacific Union in 1989 as a commercial real estate professional,\" Pugh says. \"It is amazing to come home to the brokerage that gave me my start. The incredible dynamics and future growth of this brokerage with projected sales volume in 2018 of $18 billion is phenomenal.\"\n\"We are very happy to welcome Steve back at Pacific Union,\" Pacific Union President Patrick V. Barber says. \"Steve is a proven leader in commercial real estate with more than 25 years of experience. His drive and talent in building effective teams has led to billions in sales volume in multifamily and commercial properties in the Bay Area.\"\nPugh comes to Pacific Union from his position as president and CEO of Paragon Commercial Brokerage. Pugh's leadership created what was claimed to be San Francisco's largest independently held commercial real estate firm. Pacific Union CEO Mark A. McLaughlin expects the Pacific Union Commercial group under Pugh's leadership to close more than $2 billion in investment trades in the upcoming year.\nIn 2008 prior to joining Paragon Commercial Brokerage, Pugh was managing director, for Alain Pinel Investment Group. Under his leadership, the office was ranked as San Francisco's No. 1 multifamily brokerage based on total volume of multifamily sales between 2009 and 2013.\nFor the past 24 years Pugh has served as president of the Income Property Marketing Group, the Bay Area's largest networking orgaÂ­nization that promotes the sale of commercial and investment properties. He resides with his family in Sausalito.\nAbout Pacific Union International\nFounded in San Francisco in 1975, Pacific Union International, Inc. is the West Coast's premier luxury real estate brand, with 2017 sales volume of $14.1 billion. In 2018, real estate industry leaders RISMedia ranked Pacific Union as the fifth-largest brokerage in the U.S.\nThrough its 2015 acquisition of The Mark Company, the nation's leading sales and marketing firm for new urban luxury developments, Pacific Union expanded its brand to development projects from San Diego to Seattle.\nIn 2016, Pacific Union merged with Los Angeles-based brokerage John Aaroe Group, followed in 2017 with mergers with Partners Trust and Gibson International also based in Los Angeles, and Empire Realty Associates, extending the Pacific Union brand to become the preeminent leader and ultimate California real estate company.
