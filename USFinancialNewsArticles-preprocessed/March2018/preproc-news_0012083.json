These new leaders will support the company's momentum, focused on further improving the consumer experience and continued expansion of the brand's grocery distribution footprint.\nThis announcement follows a groundbreaking year of company growth, including channel expansion into Whole Foods and Sprouts retail locations nationwide, and extensive product innovation that has doubled the Bulletproof product portfolio year-over-year. Products include the release of the brand's first ever ready-to-drink cold brew version of its famous Bulletproof Coffee, leading-edge supplements like Smart Mode, and convenient travel packs of Brain Octane oil to support consumers' on-the-go lifestyle with keto-friendly products. In 2017, the company also experienced a 70 percent increase in its employee base and brick and mortar expansion including a new Seattle café and the opening of Bulletproof Labs in Santa Monica.\n\"I'm thrilled to have Pat, Keith and Amy Jo join us on Bulletproof's mission to create products and provide information that radically improve lives.

Amy Jo DiMeglio, vice president of retail cafés: Amy Jo has deep retail experience with Whole Foods Market, where she was responsible for overseeing sales and operations of hundreds of Allegro cafes. Amy Jo oversees day-to-day operations of Bulletproof Cafés and future retail growth strategy for the brand and has been instrumental in rolling out the \"Powered by Bulletproof\" program in Whole Foods Markets nationwide.\n\"I'm excited to join such a passionate nutrition-forward company. Bulletproof is at the forefront of creating products that easily fit in with on-the-go lifestyles and help people tap into their unlimited power,\" said Patrick Brown, general manager and vice president of sales for Bulletproof. \"How people define nutrition changes so rapidly, and Bulletproof is on the leading edge of that, backed by science and credibility.\"\nBulletproof continues to grow as the leader in human performance and nutrition.
