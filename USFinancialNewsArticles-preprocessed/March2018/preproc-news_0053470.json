    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, March 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Callan , a leading institutional investment consulting firm, announced today that current Chief Executive Officer, Chief Research Officer, and President, Greg Allen , will be transitioning the role of President to the current Head of Callan’s Fund Sponsor Consulting (“FSC”) group, James Callahan , effective April 1, 2018. Concurrently, Millie Viqueira , the current manager of Callan’s New Jersey FSC office, will become the Head of the FSC group, while continuing to oversee the New Jersey practice .\n“This is the final piece of the succession plan that we began enacting last September,” said Allen. “Now that I’m settled in as CEO, Ron [Peyton, Executive Chairman] and I are ready to make these important transitions.” Allen continued, “In addition to being the leader of our Fund Sponsor Consulting Group, Jim plays an important role on both our Management Committee and our Client Policy Review Committee. He is tremendously qualified for this role bringing deep experience and perspective on the business. Ron and I look forward to collaborating with Jim as well as the rest of our deep management team in leading Callan into the future.”\nCallahan joined the firm in 1993, becoming a key contributor to the firm’s success. “It is an honor and a privilege to join Ron and Greg in leading the firm,” said Callahan. “I’ve spent 25 years with Callan, and my primary goal as a consultant has been to put our clients’ interests first. As President, I will continue to encourage all of our associates to pursue that same goal.”\nViqueira joined the firm in 1991, and has worked with fund sponsor clients throughout her entire career. “Millie has already proven to be a strong leader for our New Jersey practice, as well as a vital contributor to our Management Committee and our Manager Search Committee,” said Allen. “She receives rave reviews from her clients and sets a great example for the consultants in her office and across the firm. This is a natural career progression for her, and a great opportunity for us to leverage her 27 years of experience at Callan.”\n“I’m thrilled to have the opportunity to work closely with all of our consultants. As a team, we will build on all of our successes and continue to work to address the evolving needs of our clients,” said Viqueira.\nAbout Callan LLC\nCallan was founded as an employee-owned investment consulting firm in 1973.
