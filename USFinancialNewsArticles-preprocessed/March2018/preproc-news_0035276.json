    "text": "March 19, 2018 / 8:01 PM / Updated 4 hours ago Broadway stars Lin-Manuel Miranda and Platt release #MarchforOurLives song Reuters Staff 2 Min Read LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Two of Broadway’s biggest stars teamed up to release a song on Monday in support of the March for Our Lives gun control movement started by students at a Florida high school. “Hamilton” musical creator Lin-Manuel Miranda and Ben Platt, the Tony-winning star of teen musical “Dear Evan Hansen,” recorded a mashup of two songs from the respective shows called “Found/Tonight.” A portion of the proceeds from the song will support the March for Our Lives initiative aimed at pressuring U.S. lawmakers to tighten laws on gun ownership. Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School are organising marches in Washington D.C. and elsewhere in the United States on March 24 after 17 students and teachers at their school in Parkland, Florida, were killed in a mass shooting last month.

REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni “It’s so inspiring to see young people standing up for what is probably the most important cause right now in this country, and demanding action,” Platt, 24, said in a statement. “I hope that this song can play some small part in bringing about real change.” Miranda said he was “awestruck by the strength and leadership of the students and their ability to speak truth to power.” FILE PHOTO: 60th Annual Grammy Awards – Photo Room – New York, U.S., 28/01/2018 – Ben Platt poses with his Grammy for best musical theatre album for \"Dear Evan Hansen.\" REUTERS/Carlo Allegri The emotional song and a music video combines the “Hamilton” song “Story of Tonight” with “You Will Be Found” from Tony-winning musical “Dear Evan Hansen.” It was among the top five trending items on YouTube on Monday. “I just listened to it and I can’t stop crying I’m gonna listen to this forever holy heck,” Emma Gonzalez, one of the student leaders, said on Twitter. March for Our Lives has also received support and hefty financial donations from the likes of Oprah Winfrey, George Clooney, director Steven Spielberg and singers Justin Timberlake, Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga and Demi Lovato.
