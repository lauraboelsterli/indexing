(Nasdaq:ZFGN), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company leveraging its proprietary knowledge of MetAP2 systems biology to develop novel therapies for patients affected by a range of metabolic diseases, today reported its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.\n“After a relatively quiet period of intense scientific work here at the company in 2017, Zafgen has emerged in 2018 with momentum, spanning an expanded pipeline of high potential development candidates, each targeting a specific and significantly underserved area within the broad metabolic disease category,” said Jeffrey Hatfield, Chief Executive Officer. “We are an energized team in 2018, executing on our operating plans, with the goal of delivering multiple value creating milestones throughout the year. Just today, we announced positive interim data from our ongoing Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial with ZGN-1061 involving patients with type 2 diabetes, which has further boosted our confidence and enthusiasm for the program going forward.”\nRecent Corporate and Clinical Highlights\nZGN-1061\nToday, Zafgen announced encouraging results from an interim analysis of the ongoing 12 week Phase 2 proof-of-concept ZAF-1061-201 clinical trial of ZGN-1061 in type 2 diabetes, reflecting data from 57 patients at 8 weeks in the trial at the time of the interim analysis.\nInterim data suggest that ZGN-1061 is safe and well-tolerated in the trial, with no safety signals observed or reported, and side effects generally comparable to placebo.\nInterim analysis of efficacy data indicates that the 0.9 mg dose produced a statistically significant placebo adjusted change in A1C at 8 weeks of -0.57%, p < 0.05.\nBased on the confidence instilled by the safety and tolerability results of this interim analysis, Zafgen has opted to explore the higher end of the therapeutic range of ZGN-1061 by adding a 1.8 mg dose arm to the trial. This arm will run nearly in parallel with completion of long-term toxicology studies for ZGN-1061, and is not expected to materially affect the timing of a potential Phase 2b trial. The company remains on track to announce full 12 week topline data from the core part of this proof-of-concept clinical trial mid-year. Results including the additional arm are expected in early 2019.\nZGN-1258\nZafgen unveiled plans in early January to return to the rare metabolic disease space with ZGN-1258, targeting an initial indication in Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS).\nThis quarter, the company has initiated formal investigational new drug (IND) enabling studies with ZGN-1258.\nCorporate\nIn December 2017, the company completed a $20 million venture debt financing agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, increasing its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance to $102.1 million as of December 31, 2017.\nIn October 2017, Zafgen appointed Jeffrey Hatfield as its Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Hatfield is a veteran biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry leader, with over three decades of experience. Most recently, he served as the Chief Executive Officer of Vitae Pharmaceuticals, Inc., from the company’s formation until its acquisition by Allergan plc in October 2016.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results\n“Ending 2017 with $102 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, including the completion of the venture debt financing in December 2017, has provided the company with the necessary capital to achieve multiple potential value creating milestones as we continue to advance ZGN-1258 towards the clinic this year and continue to progress ZGN-1061 towards Phase 2 clinical trial data mid-year,” stated Patricia Allen, Chief Financial Officer. “We expect to end 2018 with greater than $40 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.”\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nAs of December 31, 2017, the company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $102.1 million.\nNet Loss\nThe company reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $13.1 million, or $0.48 per share, compared to a net loss of $10.4 million, or $0.38 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, the company reported a net loss of $52.0 million, or $1.90 per share, compared to $57.9 million, or $2.12 per share, for the full year 2016.\nThe weighted average common shares (basic and diluted) outstanding used to compute net loss per share were 27,489,397 for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 27,322,515 for the same quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, weighted average common shares (basic and diluted) outstanding used to compute net loss per share were 27,433,239 compared to 27,297,934 for the full year 2016.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $10.9 million compared to $7.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in research and development expenses compared to the prior year period was primarily due to increased clinical trial costs related to ZGN-1061 and discovery and screening of new MetAP2 inhibitors, including ZGN-1258.The increase was partially offset by a decrease in spend related to the company’s first-generation MetAP2 inhibitor.\nFor the full year 2017, research and development expenses were $40.8 million, compared to $39.9 million for the full year 2016. The slight increase in research and development expenses for the full year period was primarily due to increased nonclinical, manufacturing and clinical trial costs related to ZGN-1061 and discovery and screening of new MetAP2 inhibitors, including ZGN-1258. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in spend related to the company’s first- generation MetAP2 inhibitor, including consultants, as well as reduced personnel-related costs as a result of the reduction in workforce during the third quarter of 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $2.4 million, compared to $3.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the prior year period was primarily due to a decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation expense as well as a decrease in professional fees.\nFor the full year 2017, general and administrative expenses were $12.2 million, compared to $18.3 million for the full year 2016. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the full year 2017 as compared to the prior year period was primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related costs primarily as a result of the reduction in workforce during the third quarter of 2016. There was also a decrease in professional fees and non-cash stock-based compensation expense period over period.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nThe company expects that its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance will be greater than $40 million as of December 31, 2018.\nConference Call Information\nZafgen will host an investor conference call today, March 6, 2018 at 4:30 p.m., Eastern Time, to discuss the company's fourth quarter 2017 and full year 2017 results as well as other forward-looking information about Zafgen's business.
