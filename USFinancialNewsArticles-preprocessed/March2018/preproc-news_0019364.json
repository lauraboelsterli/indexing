    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Uber appears to be back on track after a series of missteps and has recently made strong progress in preparing for what could be the largest unicorn IPO, according to a new SharesPost’s report .\n“Though the past 12 months have been rocky for Uber, we remain cautiously optimistic,” said Rohit Kulkarni , Managing Director and Head of Research of SharesPost, Inc. “With the progress made by Uber’s new CEO, the investment from SoftBank and Waymo’s settlement behind the company, the outlook appears to be positive for Uber.”\nKey findings from SharesPost’s new report, Uber Back on Track? Unlocking Upside In Uber Shares , include the following:\nSoftBank can bring order to Uber and the chaos of the ridesharing industry. After the most recent series G-1 financing, Uber has raised more than $14 billion in primary financing. SoftBank has now invested more than $20 billion in ridesharing companies, including DiDi, Grab, and Ola. SoftBank could play a key role in the industry’s upcoming consolidation and maturation. Uber’s sum-of-parts valuation analysis reveals upside potential. Uber could unlock greater shareholder value if it divests or spins off its self-driving car business, as well as its operations in India and other parts of Southeast Asia. SharesPost estimates that Uber’s non-core assets could be worth more than $17 billion. With its $54 billion blended valuation after the SoftBank investment, SharesPost estimates that Uber’s core business is potentially valued at $32 billion—nearly three times the company’s estimated net revenues for 2018. New CEO readies Uber for IPO. Even with major, back-to-back successes, CEO Dara Khosrowshahi’s pre-IPO, to-do list remains long. His next step should be prioritizing internal team-building and employee morale over external corporate development initiatives or media/investor relations.\nTo view recent SharesPost research reports click here .\nAbout SharesPost, Inc.\nSharesPost is an SEC-registered broker-dealer, investment advisor and an approved Alternative Trading System.
