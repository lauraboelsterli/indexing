    "text": "TORONTO, March 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just Energy Group Inc. (“Just Energy”) (TSX:JE) (NYSE:JE), announced today that it has received TSX approval to initiate a normal course issuer bid (“NCIBs”) for (i) its 6.75 % convertible unsecured senior subordinated debentures due December 31, 2021 (the “Debentures”) (TSX:JE.DB.C); and renewal of its NCIB for common shares (the “Common Shares”) (TSX:JE) (NYSE:JE) expiring March 16, 2018.\nAll Debentures and all Common Shares purchased under each of the above referenced NCIBs will be cancelled. The following table indicates the principal amount of the Debentures and number of Common Shares that were outstanding at close of trading February 28, 2018 and that may be purchased during the year starting March 19, 2018 and ending March 15, 2019.\nUnder each NCIB, Just Energy may purchase Debentures and Common Shares representing 10% of the outstanding public float at the close of business February 28, 2018, up to the following limits:\nOutstanding - Close of Trading -\nFebruary 28, 2018\nLimit on Purchases\nBetween March 19, 2018 to March 15, 2019\n(Principal Amount)\nTotal Limit (1) Daily Limit (2) (3) (a) $6.75% $160,000,000 Debentures\n$16,000,000 $38,565 (b) 148,346,420 Common Shares 9,733,847 115,449 Notes:\nRepresents 10% of the public float at February 28, 2018. The average daily trading volume (“ADTV”) for the 6.75% Debentures was $154,260 at February 28, 2018. The ADTV for the Common Shares was 461,797 at February 28, 2018.\nIn addition to providing shareholder liquidity, Just Energy believes that its Common Shares trade in a price range which does not adequately reflect the value of such Common Shares in relation to Just Energy’s business and its current annual $0.50 dividend per Common Share, and accordingly, Just Energy’s future business prospects. As a result, depending upon future price movements and other factors, Just Energy believes that Just Energy’s Common Shares represent an attractive investment. In addition to providing Debenture holder liquidity, Just Energy believes that the Debentures may trade in a price range which does not adequately reflect the value of such Debentures in relation to Just Energy’s business, and accordingly Just Energy’s future business prospects. As a result, depending upon future price movements and other factors, Just Energy believes that Just Energy’s Debentures represent an attractive investment and will enable Just Energy to continue to deleverage its balance sheet.\nJust Energy intends to commence each of the NCIBs on March 19, 2018. Each of the NCIBs will expire on March 15, 2019 or such earlier date as Just Energy completes its purchases pursuant to each NCIB. All purchases made under each NCIB will be made through the facilities of the TSX, the New York Stock Exchange (only in respect of the Common Shares) or alternative trading systems, if eligible, in accordance with the rules of the TSX and applicable securities laws, at market prices prevailing at the time of purchase (plus brokerage fees). The actual amount of Debentures and Common Shares that may be purchased under each NCIB is subject to, and cannot exceed the limits referred to above. The timing of such purchases will be determined by Just Energy.\nPursuant to a previous notice of intention to conduct a normal course issuer bid, under which Just Energy sought and received approval from the TSX to purchase up to 9,655,649 Common Shares for the period from March 17, 2017 to March 16, 2018, Just Energy purchased, as of March 14, 2017, 1,667,827 Common Shares on the open market at an average purchase price of $7.10 per Common Share.\nAbout Just Energy Group Inc.\nEstablished in 1997, Just Energy is a leading retail energy provider specializing in electricity and natural gas commodities, energy efficiency solutions, and renewable energy options.
