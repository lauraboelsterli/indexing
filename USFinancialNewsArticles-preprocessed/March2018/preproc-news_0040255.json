EU officials have said that the leaders will discuss how to defend Europe from Russian disinformation and cyber attacks at the summit, which comes days after Vladimir Putin was reelected to a fourth term as Russian president. It also comes a spike in tensions between Russia and the West over Britainâ€™s claims that Russia was behind a nerve agent attack on a former Russian double agent in London.
