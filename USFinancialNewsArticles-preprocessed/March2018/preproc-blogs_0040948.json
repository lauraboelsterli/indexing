Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is scheduled to take the stage later Wednesday at an event sponsored by Axios where he and others will discuss the \"future of work.\" \nThe event is taking place at Howard University in Washington, and includes MSNBC hosts Stephanie Ruhle and Ali Velshi, AOL co-founder Steve Case and comedian Baratunde Thurston.\nOn Wednesday, Dimon announced the bank was investing $1 million in two programs for high-growth startups founded by women of color, one of them also supported by the Case Foundation.\nIn January, Dimon announced plans for J. P. Morgan to spend $20 billion over five years to raise hourly pay for a portion of its workforce, add jobs and open 400 branches in new U.S. locations.\nThe bank said tax breaks, reduced regulation and an improved business climate have made it possible to make these changes, which also include adding 4,000 jobs and increasing its charitable giving.",
