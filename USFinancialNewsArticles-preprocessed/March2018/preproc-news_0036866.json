    "text": "Published: Mar 21, 2018 9:58 a.m. ET Share \nMark Anthony Conditt, 23, was a resident of suburban Pfluggerville, Texas; dead after police confrontation Reuters A Texas Department of Public Safety vehicle blocks a street into the neighborhood where the Austin bomb suspect was believed to have lived in Pfluggerville, Texas. \nBy Russell Gold Erin Ailworth \nROUND ROCK, Texas—A man identified as Mark Anthony Conditt and who police believe carried out a string of package bombings in Austin is dead, putting an end to a weekslong hunt to track down and stop the bomber who had the Texas capital and its residents on edge. \nLaw-enforcement officials traced the 23-year-old white male to a hotel in this Austin suburb, about 20 miles north of the city, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said. In a confrontation with the police, the suspect detonated a device and died, he said. Shots were fired during the encounter with police. \n“We believe that this individual is responsible for all incidents that have taken place in Austin, starting on March 2nd and those that have occurred since then as well,” Chief Manley said, referring to the wave of bombings that have killed two people and wounded several more. \nOfficials said they hadn’t yet identified a motive, and they would be investigating whether any accomplices aided the suspect. Earlier reports said the suspect was 24 years old. ",
