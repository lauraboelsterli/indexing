The bank said it planned to issue new shares with a nominal value of 1 dirhams for a subscription price per share at no less than 10 percent discount to the prevailing market price.\nIt is the latest Gulf bank seeking to raise its capital in recent weeks. National Commercial Bank, Saudi Arabia’s largest lender, and Dubai Islamic Bank have both announced similar moves.\nEmirates NBD’s capital increase will be discussed at a general meeting of shareholders on March 27.\nThe bank said is was also seeking shareholder approval for a $12.5 billion medium term note programme, a $1 billion structured note programme and a 1.5 billion Australian dollars debt issuance programme.\n$1 = 3.6730 UAE dirham Reporting By Tom Arnold;Editing by Michael Perry\n ",
