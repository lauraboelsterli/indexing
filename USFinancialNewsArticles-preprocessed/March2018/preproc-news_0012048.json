    "text": "March 4, 2018 / 5:20 AM / in 4 hours Tennis: Tsurenko fights back to defend Acapulco title Reuters Staff 1 Min Read (Reuters) - Ukraine’s Lesia Tsurenko battled back from the brink of defeat to successfully defend her Mexican Open title with a 5-7 7-6(2) 6-2 victory over Stefanie Voegele in the final in Acapulco on Sunday. Swiss Voegele was only three points from clinching the match in two sets but Tsurenko forced a tiebreak and it was nearly all one-way traffic from there as the Ukrainian took command in a nearly three-hour battle of attrition. After dominating the tiebreak to even up the contest, the 28-year-old world number 40 walzed through the final set to secure the fourth title of her career. “It’s such a special tournament for me, winning here for the second time,” Tsurenko said.“This is just an unbelievable feeling for me to be here.” Reporting by Andrew Both, editing by Nick Mulvenney",
