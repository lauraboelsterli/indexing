    "text": "SALT LAKE CITY, March 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ZAGG Inc (Nasdaq:ZAGG), a leading global mobile lifestyle company, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter Highlights (Comparisons versus Fourth Quarter 2016)\nNet sales of $176.9 million, a 54% increase compared to $114.9 million Gross margin of 32% compared to 26% Pre-tax income of $30.0 million compared to a pre-tax loss of $(4.2) million Adjusted EBITDA of $35.8 million compared to $3.8 million\n2017 Full Year Highlights (Comparisons versus Full Year 2016)\nNet sales of $519.5 million, a 29% increase compared to $401.9 million Gross margin of 33% compared to 32% Pre-tax income of $43.4 million compared to a pre-tax loss of $(23.6) million Adjusted EBITDA of $73.0 million, a 96% increase compared to $37.2 million\n2018 Full Year Outlook\nNet sales in the range of $550 million to $570 million Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $77 million to $80 million\n“We delivered record financial results in 2017 highlighted by a very strong fourth quarter,” commented Randy Hales, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The sales momentum we generated earlier in the year continued to accelerate during the holiday season fueled by global demand for our existing products as well as new introductions from both the InvisibleShield and mophie brands. The combination of robust top-line growth and greater operating efficiencies throughout our organization led to a dramatic increase in profitability. We begin 2018 with leading market share positions in screen protection, power cases, and external power along with a rapidly growing presence in wireless charging. I am confident that ZAGG is well situated financially, strategically and operationally to capitalize on the many opportunities ahead of us while creating greater value for shareholders.”\nFourth Quarter Results\nFor the Three Months Ended (in millions, except per share amounts) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Net Sales $176.9 $114.9 Gross Margin $56.2 $29.9 Gross Margin % 32% 26% Net Income (Loss) $8.1 $(4.1) Earnings (Loss) per Share $0.28 $(0.15) Adjusted EBITDA $35.8 $3.8 Adjusted EBITDA % 20% 3% (See chart below for summary of tax reform impact on 2017 net income and earnings per share)\nNet sales increased 54% to $176.9 million compared to $114.9 million due primarily to (1) the increase in sales of our power management products, particularly accessories supporting the wireless charging ecosystem, and (2) increased sales of screen protection products in key wireless and retail accounts, particularly in international markets. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company launched the juice pack power cases for the iPhone 7 and 7+, however, there was no similar juice pack load-in during the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting in a decline in overall power case sales quarter over quarter.\nGross profit increased to $56.2 million (32% of net sales), compared to $29.9 million (26% of net sales). The increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to improvements in margins of mophie branded product, partially offset by an increase in freight costs.\nOperating expense decreased 22% to $26.2 million (15% of net sales) compared to $33.4 million (29% of net sales). The decrease in operating expense was primarily attributable to a $7.0 million gain recorded during the period associated with the settlement of litigation related to the disputed mophie purchase price.\nNet income was $8.1 million compared to net loss of $(4.1) million. Diluted earnings per share was $0.28 (on 28.8 million shares) compared to diluted loss per share of $(0.15) (on 28.1 million shares). Excluding the impact of recent tax reform, fourth quarter 2017 net income was $20.5 million and earnings per share was $0.71. (Please see the table accompanying this release that outlines the tax reform impact on net income and earnings per share)\nAdjusted EBITDA was $35.8 million compared to $3.8 million.\n2017 Full Year Results\nFor the Years Ended (in millions, except per share amounts) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Net Sales $519.5 $401.9 Gross Margin $169.0 $127.6 Gross Margin % 33% 32% Net Income (Loss) $15.1 $(15.6) Earnings (Loss) per Share $0.53 $(0.56) Adjusted EBITDA $73.0 $37.2 Adjusted EBITDA % 14% 9% (See chart below for summary of tax reform impact on 2017 net income and earnings per share)\nNet sales increased 29% to $519.5 million, compared to $401.9 million due primarily to (1) the increase in sales of our power management products, particularly accessories supporting the wireless charging ecosystem, (2) increased sales of screen protection products in key wireless and retail accounts, particularly in international markets, and (3) the inclusion of 12 months of mophie sales during 2017 versus only 10 months in 2016. Prior to the acquisition in 2016, mophie recorded sales of $17.3 million, which if added to the full year 2016 sales total of $401.9 million, the Company would still have realized an increase in sales compared to 2016 of $100.3 million or 24%.\nGross profit increased to $169.0 million (33% of net sales), compared to $127.6 million (32% of net sales). The increase in gross profit margin was primarily due to improvements in margins of mophie branded product and a $2.6 million charge incurred during 2016 related to the impact of the fair value write-up of mophie inventory that did not recur in 2017. This increase was partially offset by an increase in freight costs and a shift in the product mix whereby 2017 screen protection sales were a smaller percentage of overall sales compared to the prior year (although overall screen protection sales increased by $33.6 million or 16%).\nOperating expense decreased to $124.3 million (24% of net sales) compared to $149.0 million (37% of net sales). The decrease in operating expenses was primarily attributable to (1) a $24.3 million loss related to the disputed mophie purchase price in 2016 that did not recur in 2017, (2) a $7.0 million gain recorded in 2017 associated with the settlement of litigation related to the disputed mophie purchase price, (3) synergies from cost reduction initiatives, (4) lower transaction-related costs, (5) a reduction in advertising and marketing spend, and (6) an overall reduction in amortization expense. These decreases were partially offset by the following increases: (1) the inclusion of 12 months of mophie-related expenses for 2017 compared with 10 months in 2016, (2) the $2.0 million impairment of an intangible asset in 2017, and (3) an increase in operating expense related to the launch of certain wireless charging accessories.\nNet income increased to $15.1 million compared to net loss of $(15.6) million. Diluted earnings per share was $0.53 (on 28.4 million shares) compared to diluted loss per share of $(0.56) (on 28.0 million shares). Excluding the impact of recent tax reform, 2017 net income was $27.5 million and earnings per share was $0.97. Please see the table accompanying this release that outlines the tax reform impact on net income and earnings per share.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $73.0 million compared to $37.2 million.\n2018 Business Outlook\nFor the full year 2018, the Company currently expects:\nNet sales of $550 million to $570 million Gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales in the low to mid 30’s range Adjusted EBITDA of $77 million to $80 million Diluted earnings per share of $1.30 to $1.50 Annual effective tax rate of approximately 27%\nImpact of 2017 Tax Reform Bill\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the United States Government passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), which enacted significant changes to the United States’ federal tax code, including a reduction in the federal income tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21%. As of December 31, 2017, Management recorded a primarily non-cash charge of $12.4 million to income tax expense primarily to reflect (1) the re-measurement of deferred tax assets utilizing the lower federal income tax rate and (2) the tax on mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings.\nThe impact of this $12.4 million charge on the income tax rate, net income, and earnings per share for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, is illustrated in the table below (amounts in millions, except per share data):\n(in millions, except per share amounts) Three Months\nEnded\nDecember 31,\n2017 Twelve Months\nEnded\nDecember 31,\n2017 Income before provision for income taxes $30.0 $43.4 Tax provision before impact of tax reform $(9.5) $(15.9) Net income before impact of tax reform $20.5 $27.5 Diluted earnings per share before impact of tax reform $0.71 $0.97 Effective income tax rate before impact of tax reform 32% 37% Tax provision attributable to tax reform $(12.4) $(12.4) Net income $8.1 $15.1 Diluted earnings per share $0.28 $0.53 Effective income tax rate 73% 65% Conference Call\nA conference call will be held today, March 7, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. EST to review these results.
