    "text": "VIENNA, March 6 (Reuters) - Austrian lighting group Zumtobel reported an operating loss of 2.2 million euros ($2.7 million) for its third quarter, higher than expected, due to a further decline at its operations in Britain, increased price pressure in the industry and internal problems.\nRevenues fell 7.3 percent to 283.7 million euros, the group said on Tuesday.\nAnalysts had expected a third quarter loss before interest and taxes (EBIT) of 0.7 million euros on revenues of 275 million euros.
