    "text": "MILAN (Reuters) - Matteo Salvini, the head of Italy’s main conservative bloc and leader of the League party, said on Friday that he will propose a budget plan that will be the “opposite” of what the European Commission in Brussels wants.\nFILE PHOTO: Northern League leader Matteo Salvini gestures during a meeting in Rome, Italy, March 1, 2018. REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi/File Photo “Soon we will make a budget proposal... and it will be the opposite of what Brussels asked for,” Salvini told reporters after meeting with his party’s lawmakers in Milan, adding that he would be the EU’s “adversary” if it wanted austerity.\nThe far-right League is the largest party in the right-wing coalition and is seeking to form a government, but does not have enough seats in parliament to do it alone. Formal consultations to build a coalition have not yet begun.\nItaly’s centre-left caretaker government said on Thursday it will not issue new, multi-year budget targets until a new government has been formed following Sunday’s inconclusive election.\nReporting by Sara Rossi, Editing by Crispian Balmer\n ",
