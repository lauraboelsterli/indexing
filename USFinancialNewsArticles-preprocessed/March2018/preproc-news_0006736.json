    "text": "March 1, 2018 / 5:51 AM / Updated 24 minutes ago METALS-Shanghai copper slides for 4th day amid slump in equities Reuters Staff 4 Min Read (Changes comment, updates prices) BEIJING, March 1 (Reuters) - Shanghai copper prices fell for a fourth day on Thursday, posting their lowest close in more than two weeks, as the dollar hit a six-week high and most global stock markets declined. A stronger dollar makes metals more expensive for holders of other currencies, weighing on prices. Other metals took some respite after upbeat manufacturing data from top metals consumer China, although only aluminium and zinc closed up in Shanghai. \"The metals generally feel as if speculative traders in particular got long looking for a rush of buying after the Chinese New Year, but with tight nearby credit and cold weather slowing things down that buying has yet to be seen,\" Malcolm Freeman, CEO of Kingdom Futures, said in a note. FUNDAMENTALS * SHFE COPPER: The most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange ended down 0.9 percent at 52,290 yuan ($8,249.33) a tonne, its lowest close since Feb. 13. It is down 2.4 percent so far this week. * LME COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange edged up 0.1 percent to $6,939.50 a tonne by 0714 GMT, having fallen by 1.3 percent each in the previous two sessions. It earlier marked $6,905, its lowest since Feb. 13. * CHINA: The private Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for February beat expectations to reach its highest in six months, a day after China's official factory activity reading raised concerns of a sharper-than-expected slowdown in the world's second biggest economy. * ALUMINIUM: China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has pledged to strengthen its monitoring of the price of nonferrous metals such as aluminium in order to prevent \"excessive\" speculation that could distort the market. * MONGOLIA: The Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine in Mongolia's southern Gobi Desert will lift force majeure effective March 1 and majority owner Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd said on Wednesday that it expected to make up any sales-related effects over the next few quarters. * VALE: Brazil's Vale, the world's No.1 nickel producer, plans to save well over $150 million by reducing costs across its nickel operations, which have notched positive cash flow for the past two months, company executives said.
