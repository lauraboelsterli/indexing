    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Thursday it was voluntarily recalling Model S sedans built before April 2016 in order to replace bolts in the power steering component.\nFILE PHOTO - A row of Tesla Model S sedans are seen outside the company's headquarters in Palo Alto, California April 30, 2015. REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage Tesla said there were no accidents or injuries related to the issue and the recall was undertaken in an abundance of caution.\nThe bolts, made by German supplier Bosch, can begin to corrode after contact in cold temperatures with road salt. Some Tesla owners had complained about the issue on online forums.\nSome 123,000 Model S vehicles globally contain the bolts, Tesla said.\n“We have observed excessive corrosion in the power steering bolts, though only in very cold climates, particularly those that frequently use calcium or magnesium road salts, rather than sodium chloride (table salt),” Tesla wrote in an email to customers.\nWere the bolts to fail, the driver would still able to steer the car but would need to use more force “due to loss or reduction of power assist,” Tesla wrote.\nA retrofit in Tesla service centers should take about an hour, Tesla said.\nReporting by Alexandria Sage; Editing by Tom Brown\n ",
