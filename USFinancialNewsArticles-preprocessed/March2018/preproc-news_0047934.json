    "text": "0 COMMENTS A buildup in trade tensions between the U.S. and China would create “a lose-lose situation,” Volkswagen AG’s VLKAY 4.61% finance chief warned Monday.\n“An escalation is, hopefully, a scenario that can be avoided,” Chief Financial Officer Frank Witter said in an interview with CFO Journal. “That’s the reason why it is important to get to the table and talk about the issues on both sides.”\nMr. Witter is one of several executives at large international companies, including Apple Inc. and BlackRock Inc., who have sounded warnings after a week of harsh words from Beijing and Washington.\nBoth the U.S. and China are important markets for Volkswagen, and a trade war could be detrimental to the Wolfsburg, Germany-based auto maker. “De-escalation is critical,” Mr. Witter said.\nMr. Witter is reviewing Volkswagen’s supply chain but said he wouldn’t be able to make short-term changes if trade relations between the European Union and the U.S. or between the U.S. and China change significantly.\n“In our industry, there is no way to make any abrupt, larger-scale short-term movements,” Mr. Witter said. “You have a footprint, you have contracts, you have a supply base, you have capacity. We invested significant amounts of money in premises and facilities so, therefore, our industry has limited short-term flexibility,” he said.\nThe Trump administration last week set out specific demands that included greater access to China by U.S. auto makers, chip makers and financial firms. President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened to impose tariffs on as much as $60 billion of Chinese imports, while China on Friday rolled out penalties against $3 billion in U.S. goods as Washington’s levies on imported steel and aluminum took effect on the same day.\nThe EU’s temporary exemption from the U.S.’s tariffs on imported steel and aluminum means “we bought time,” Mr. Witter said. “But the subject isn’t off the table,” he said, calling the trade dispute between the U.S. and various international trading partners “a complicated matter.”\nChanges to the North American Free Trade Agreement also might have an impact on Volkswagen. The auto maker has production facilities in both Mexico and the U.S. and recently opened a factory for its Audi Q5 SUV in Mexico.\n“Nobody knows what the new rules would look like,” Mr. Witter said, referring to the continuing renegotiation of the Nafta. U.S. companies with operations in Mexico and Canada could be affected as well as foreign firms doing business in all three countries, he said.\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com",
