    "text": "LOS ALTOS, Calif., March 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Netskope, the leader in cloud security , today announced that in 2017, subscriptions grew by triple digits, headcount increased by 50% to 475 people, and 25% of the Fortune 100 adopted the market leading Netskope platform. The number of cloud transactions Netskope processed from existing and new customers increased by more than 1,000 percent, and the company now safely enables the world's largest deployments of Box, Slack, and Microsoft Office 365.\nNetskope has continually focused on enhancing its team via hiring some of the best technical minds and leaders who also fit its open, collaborative and innovation culture. One of those recent hires is Adi Ofer as vice president, engineering. Previous to joining Netskope, Ofer was the Head of Data Infrastructure, Storage and Autonomous Vehicle Infrastructure for Uber, and previous to that led Google's BigTable and Google+ backend, two of the largest data and analytic stores in the world. Additionally, Beau Hutto joined the company as vice president, Federal Sales. Hutto will lead the company's federal market strategy. Previously, Hutto served as VP of Federal Sales at Blue Coat Systems and led Federal Advanced Technology Sales at Juniper.\nNetskope is also welcoming Tony Bates, CEO of Growth at Social Capital, to its board of directors. Bates brings a wealth of experience to Netskope from his previous executive roles as well as being on the Boards of GoPro, eBay and VMware. As a board director, he will help Netskope with expansion as the company builds out its operations on every major continent.\n\"In an industry as crucial as cybersecurity, Netskope's track record of executing on innovative technical advancements that meaningfully move the needle for customers is truly unique, as evidenced by the company's penetration of the Fortune 100,\" said Tony Bates, CEO, Social Capital Growth. \"Sanjay has built a world-class team of some the brightest minds in cybersecurity and many of the world's largest enterprises are securing their clouds with Netskope. I look forward to helping play a role in the next chapter of the company's evolution.\"\nNetskope's momentum comes on the heels of a record-breaking year, including a $100 million funding round led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and Accel and doubling customer growth. The company was named as a leader in Gartner's first-ever Magic Quadrant for Cloud Access Security Brokers ( CASBs ), included on the Silicon Valley Business Journal's list of the three \"hottest cybersecurity startups\" of 2017, and listed in the top 10 of Forbes' 100 Best Cloud Computing Companies to Work For in 2018.\n\"Netskope's rapid growth in 2017 is a testament to the demand for cloud security in the enterprise and proof that the market wants more than just any cloud security solution, it wants an intelligent solution that was built from the ground up, just as we have always been,\" said Sanjay Beri, CEO & Founder at Netskope. \"Netskope is excited to have an industry veteran like Tony Bates coming on board, and I look forward to working with him as we continue to establish Netskope as an iconic security company.\"\nFounded and led by security industry veterans with more than 100 patents combined, Netskope helps enterprises take full advantage of the cloud without compromising security.
