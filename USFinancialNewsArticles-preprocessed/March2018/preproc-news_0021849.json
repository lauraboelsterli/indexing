    "text": "PALO ALTO, Calif., March 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Inpixon (NASDAQ:INPX), a leading indoor positioning and data analytics company, today announced the company has appointed John Piccininni as Vice President of Business Development. An industry veteran, Mr. Piccininni is a business development and channel sales management strategist who develops long-term relationships with channel partners and users to introduce new technologies. Inpixon is confident that Mr. Piccininni has the pedigree and leadership required to introduce Inpixon Indoor Positioning Analytics (IPA) physical cyber security and intelligence platform to businesses in various industries, including high-tech, pharma, manufacturing, energy, healthcare, and federal agencies.\nDuring the past 25 years, Mr. Piccininni has built partner networks and managed large-scale, complex sales for sophisticated identity-based physical security solutions — such as Hirsch and Identiv — that span the globe. Mr. Piccininni holds an MBA from Loyola Marymount University and lives with his family in Newport Beach, Calif.\n“After a quarter of a century building a thriving business with what is now a premier physical security systems provider, I am excited for the opportunity to bring Inpixon IPA to the market through similar channel networks,” said John Piccininni, Inpixon VP of Business Development. “Wireless and Internet of Things (IoT) technology is exploding in the workplace, and Inpixon’s ability to detect, identify, and secure the digital airwaves will be invaluable to companies faced with managing unseen threats from rogue devices, verifying device reputation, and tracking wireless assets. The great indoors is the next frontier, and I am energized to be an evangelist of the technology and Inpixon.”\n“John Piccininni’s timing could not be more perfect,” said Soumya Das, Inpixon COO. “As we charge into 2018, our focus is on helping our channel partner network grow and thrive. Mr. Piccininni is a leader in the industry and is known for cultivating long-lasting relationships with his partners. His network is overwhelmingly satisfied with the investments he has helped them make in physical access control systems (PACS) and video surveillance, and now, we are thrilled to have him onboard introducing those same long-term partners to our physical cyber security solution.”\nEffective March 12, 2018, John Piccininni joins the Inpixon Management Team as VP of Business Development.\nAbout Inpixon\nInpixon (NASDAQ:INPX) is a leader in Indoor Positioning and Data Analytics.
