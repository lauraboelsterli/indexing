    "text": "LIVONIA, Mich., March 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Tower International, Inc. (NYSE: TOWR), a leading global manufacturer of engineered automotive structural metal components and assemblies, today announced that it has filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). Under the shelf registration, once it is declared effective by the SEC, Tower may offer and sell, from time to time, up to $300 million of a variety of its securities over the next three years. The registration statement is intended to provide Tower with funding for general corporate purposes.\nUnder the shelf registration statement, Tower will have the flexibility to publicly offer and sell from time to time, common stock, preferred stock, warrants, debt securities, subscription rights, depositary shares, units or any combination of such securities. Tower may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, at prices and on terms announced, if and when the securities are ever offered. The specific terms of any potential future offerings, along with the intended use of proceeds of any such securities offered by Tower, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement at the time of any such offering.\nThe registration statement relating to these securities has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective. These securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any offer for sale, or solicitation of an offer to buy, any of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction. Any offering of the securities covered by the shelf registration statement will be made solely by means of a prospectus and an accompanying prospectus supplement relating to that offering. A copy of the prospectus included in the registration statement may be obtained on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov .\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains statements which constitute forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, regarding potential offerings of securities in the future. Forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this press release and are based upon management's current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. The risk factors described in our reports filed with the SEC could cause our actual results to differ materially from estimates or expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements. We do not assume any obligation to update or revise the forward-looking statements contained in this press release.\nContact:\nDerek Fiebig\nExecutive Director, Investor & External Relations\n(248) 675-6457\nfiebig.derek@towerinternational.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tower-international-reports-the-filing-of-a-universal-shelf-registration-statement-300607403.html\nSOURCE Tower International",
