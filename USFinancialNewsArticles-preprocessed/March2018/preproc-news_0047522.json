(OTC Pink: HEWA) announced today that its net sales for 2017 increased 43% to $14,847,262 compared to $10,384,893 in 2016.\nHealthWarehouse.com is a Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites (VIPPS) accredited online and mail-order pharmacy licensed and/or authorized to sell and deliver prescriptions to all 50 states. The Company attributed its 2017 sales performance to growth in core consumer prescription and over-the-counter product sales along with strong customer retention and acquisition.\n“I am proud to announce that the Company was able to report the first profitable year in its history, while continuing the significant growth rates in our core consumer prescription and over-the-counter businesses,” said Joseph Peters, the Company’s President and CEO. “Our results for 2017 are a reflection of our team’s dedication to providing our patients with excellent pharmacy experiences through compassion, convenience and transparency. In 2017, we were able to satisfy a large payables balance and invest in the installation of new pharmacy automation equipment. These initiatives will provide us with financial flexibility and increased productivity, positioning us well for 2018 and beyond. Additionally, we are evaluating funding options to support an expansion of our marketing campaigns, an upgrade of our pharmacy software, and the refinancing of our current debt obligations.”\nThe Company reported net income of $371,775 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to a net loss of $1,408,203 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The 2016 results include $854,651 of nonrecurring expenses including annual meeting proxy and solicitation costs and severance expense for departing executives.\nIn 2017, Adjusted EBITDA was $856,118, versus negative EBITDA of $57,544 for the same period of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to the GAAP measures is provided below.\n2017 Overview:\nNet Sales: Total net sales were $14,847,262 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $10,384,893 in 2016, an increase of $4,462,369 or 43%.

Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about the beliefs, expectations and future plans and strategies of the Company, are forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements or in management's expectations. Important factors which could cause or contribute to actual results being materially and adversely different from those described or implied by forward looking statements include, among others, risks related to competition, management of growth, access to sufficient capital to fund our business and our growth, new products, services and technologies, potential fluctuations in operating results, international expansion, outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment center optimization, seasonality, commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, foreign exchange rates, system interruption, cyber-attacks, access to sufficient inventory, government regulation and taxation, payments and fraud. More information about factors that potentially could affect HealthWarehouse.com's financial results is included in HealthWarehouse.com's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nHealthWarehouse.com, Inc. (the \"Company\") prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with the United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). In addition to disclosing financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, the Company discloses information regarding Adjusted EBITDA, which is commonly used. In addition to adjusting net loss to exclude interest, depreciation and amortization, Adjusted EBITDA also excludes stock-based compensation, and certain other nonrecurring charges. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance defined in accordance with GAAP. However, Adjusted EBITDA is used internally in planning and evaluating the Company's performance. Accordingly, management believes that disclosure of this metric offers investors, bankers and other shareholders an additional view of the Company's operations that, when coupled with the GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of the Company's financial results.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or to net cash used in operating activities as a measure of operating results or of liquidity. It may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it excludes financial information that some may consider important in evaluating the Company's performance.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180329005831/en/\nHealthWarehouse.com, Inc.\nJoseph Peters, 800-748-7001\nSource: HealthWarehouse.com, Inc.",
