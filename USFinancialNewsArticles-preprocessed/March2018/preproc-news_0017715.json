    "text": "Dorel Home posts record on-line sales Dorel Juvenile develops strongest new product pipeline in years Dorel Sports poised for improved 2018\nMONTRÉAL, March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dorel Industries Inc. (TSX:DII.B) (TSX:DII.A) today announced results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 30, 2017. Revenue for the fourth quarter was US$677.1 million, up 4.4% from US$648.7 million a year ago. Adjusted net income was US$20.4 million or US$0.62 per diluted share compared to US$7.7 million or US$0.24 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Reported net loss for the quarter was US$3.0 million or US$0.09 per diluted share compared to US$5.6 million or US$0.17 per diluted share a year ago.\nRevenue for 2017 was US$2.58 billion, compared to US$2.60 billion the previous year. Adjusted net income for the year rose 20.3% to US$70.1 million or US$2.15 per diluted share, compared to US$58.3 million or US$1.79 per diluted share in 2016. Reported net income was US$30.6 million or US$0.94 per diluted share, compared to a reported net loss of US$11.6 million or US$0.36 per diluted share the previous year.\n“Dorel’s businesses performed quite well during the fourth quarter and we are encouraged with the advancements made, setting the stage for a positive 2018,” commented Dorel President & CEO, Martin Schwartz. “Dorel Home posted excellent revenue and operating profit, with record on-line sales continuing to drive the segment. Dorel Juvenile is being transformed into a consumer-centric organization through a market-led business with a heavy emphasis on new products. We have the strongest product pipeline in years featuring exciting, innovative products planned to launch over the next 18 months. Dorel Juvenile has also made important progress in e-commerce, with each of its geographic markets projecting growth through 2018. Dorel Sports bounced back from a difficult third quarter despite continuing industry-wide weakness in the global bicycle market. Similar to Dorel Juvenile, Dorel Sports has developed an exciting line-up of new products to be launched through 2018,” concluded Mr. Schwartz.\nThe Company is presenting adjusted financial information, excluding impairment losses, restructuring and other costs, remeasurement of forward purchase agreement liabilities and loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt, as it believes this provides a more meaningful comparison of its core business performance between the periods presented. These previously announced items are detailed in the attached tables of this press release. Contained within this press release are reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nSummary of Financial Information (unaudited) Fourth Quarters Ended December 30, All figures in thousands of US $, except per share amounts 2017 2016 Change $ $ % Total revenue 677,052 648,749 4.4 % Net loss (2,992 ) (5,567 ) 46.3 % Per share - Basic (0.09 ) (0.17 ) 47.1 % Per share - Diluted (0.09 ) (0.17 ) 47.1 % Adjusted net income 20,410 7,740 163.7 % Per share - Basic 0.63 0.24 162.5 % Per share - Diluted 0.62 (1) 0.24 158.3 % Number of shares outstanding – Basic weighted average 32,426,326 32,373,809 Diluted weighted average 32,426,326 32,373,809 Adjusted diluted weighted average 35,273,605 32,630,255 (1) As at December 30, 2017, the convertible debentures were included in the calculation of the adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) by adjusting the adjusted net income attributable to equity holders as well as the adjusted diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding, as these debentures were deemed to be dilutives.\nSummary of Financial Information (unaudited) Years Ended December 30, All figures in thousands of US $, except per share amounts 2017 2016 Change $ $ % Total revenue 2,577,668 2,603,185 (1.0 %) Net income (loss) 30,583 (11,611 ) 363.4 % Per share - Basic 0.94 (0.36 ) 361.1 % Per share - Diluted 0.94 (0.36 ) 361.1 % Adjusted net income 70,097 58,251 20.3 % Per share - Basic 2.16 1.80 20.0 % Per share - Diluted 2.15 1.79 20.1 % Number of shares outstanding – Basic weighted average 32,409,551 32,352,953 Diluted weighted average 32,665,713 32,352,953\nDorel Home All figures in thousands of US $ Fourth Quarters Ended December 30 (unaudited) 2017 2016 Change $\n% of rev. $\n% of rev. % Total revenue 200,975 177,049 13.5 % Gross profit 38,698 19.3 % 29,703 16.8 % 30.3 % Operating profit 21,064 10.5 % 13,769 7.8 % 53.0 % All figures in thousands of US $ Years Ended December 30 (unaudited) 2017 2016 Change $ % of rev. $ % of rev. % Total revenue 790,619 735,247 7.5 % Gross profit 141,550 17.9 % 123,742 16.8 % 14.4 % Operating profit 78,081 9.9 % 64,180 8.7 % 21.7 % Fourth quarter revenue rose US$23.9 million, or 13.5%, to US$201.0 million. For the full year, revenue grew US$55.4 million, or 7.5%, to US$790.6 million from US$735.2 million in 2016. On-line sales were the highest ever recorded in the segment’s history as it continued to augment its product platform. For the fourth quarter and the full year, e-commerce sales represented a record 57% and 52% of total segment revenue respectively compared to 51% and 45% for the comparable periods in 2016. This revenue improvement far exceeded small reductions in the brick and mortar channel.\nFourth quarter gross profit was 19.3%, up 250 basis points and for the full year was up 110 basis points to 17.9%. Both the quarter and year-to-date improvements were due to shift of sales to higher margin items throughout the year. Warehouse and distribution costs were slightly higher than last year due to the segment’s additional overall warehouse footprint, higher wage costs and inventory levels brought on by the increased revenue.\nFourth quarter operating profit rose US$7.3 million, or 53.0%, to US$21.1 million from US$13.8 million a year ago. All Dorel Home divisions posted improved operating results. For the full year, operating profit increased US$13.9 million, or 21.7%, to US$78.1 million compared to US$64.2 million in 2016.\nDorel Juvenile All figures in thousands of US $ Fourth Quarters Ended December 30 (unaudited) 2017 2016\nChange $ % of rev. $ % of rev. % Total revenue 239,306 236,447 1.2 % Gross profit 70,645 29.5 % 71,240 30.1 % (0.8 %) Operating loss (13,558 ) (5.7 %) (17,259 ) (7.3 %) 21.4 % Adjusted gross profit 70,926 29.6 % 71,240 30.1 % (0.4 %) Adjusted operating profit (loss) 10,432 4.4 % (7,141 ) (3.0 %) 246.1 % All figures in thousands of US $ Years Ended December 30 (unaudited) 2017 2016\nChange $ % of rev. $ % of rev. % Total revenue 921,669 928,963 (0.8 %) Gross profit 275,261 29.9 % 290,618 31.3 % (5.3 %) Operating profit 13,353 1.4 % 16,760 1.8 % (20.3 %) Adjusted gross profit 276,836 30.0 % 290,618 31.3 % (4.7 %) Adjusted operating profit 45,215 4.9 % 31,314 3.4 % 44.4 % Fourth quarter revenue increased US$2.9 million, or 1.2%, to US$239.3 million from US$236.4 million last year. Excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange rates, organic revenue decreased by approximately 2.5%. Declines in traditional brick and mortar were partially offset by gains in market share at on-line retailers. In Latin America, sales increased overall, led by Brazil, but sales were lower in Chile and fell short of both prior year and 2017 expectations. Full year revenue decreased by US$7.3 million, or 0.8%, to US$921.7 million from US$929.0 million in 2016.\nFourth quarter operating loss in 2017 was US$13.6 million compared to US$17.3 million last year. 2017 results include a non-cash impairment loss on goodwill of US$19.9 million, related to certain business units within Latin America. Excluding impairment losses, restructuring and other costs, adjusted operating profit for the quarter was US$10.4 million, compared to an adjusted operating loss of US$7.1 million last year, an improvement of US$17.5 million. 2016 results included a total of US$7.8 million for a one-time write-down of certain deferred development costs and employee severance not included within restructuring expenses. In addition, product liability costs in 2017 are lower than prior year by US$8.7 million. Combined, these amounts account for US$16.5 million of the year-over-year improvement. The remaining improvement in adjusted operating profit of US$1.0 million was due to reduced operating costs, more than offsetting the lower organic revenue and margins in the quarter. Year-to-date operating profit was US$13.4 million, compared to US$16.8 million last year. Adjusted operating profit increased US$13.9 million, or 44.4%, to US$45.2 million, from US$31.3 million a year ago.\nThe economies of both Chile and Peru have slowed over the past several years, due to lower commodity prices, political uncertainty and changes in consumer behaviour. As such, coupled with stagnant growth expected in Colombia and Panama, projected earnings and cash flow growth were revised resulting in a non-cash impairment loss on goodwill of US$19.9 million, recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. Dorel Juvenile Chile continues to be the juvenile market leader with the majority market share, a large retail footprint and the number one Infanti brand. The intention is to reduce the retail footprint to focus on the most profitable products and locations, all the while remaining a leading retailer and to invest in e-commerce capabilities to become a leader within the e-commerce sales channel in its categories in Chile, Peru and eventually Colombia.\nThe revolutionary Maxi-Cosi AxissFix Air, launched in the European market during the fourth quarter of 2017, drew significant attention from opinion and media groups in Europe. The media plan was comprehensive and is expected to bolster the Maxi-Cosi brand. Part of Dorel Juvenile’s success in improving its product pipeline has been strategic sourcing to complement in-house developed product. An example is the new Maxi-Cosi Zelia urban stroller, the first globally compliant stroller for Dorel. Launched in October, with vastly improved time-to-market, only 12 months elapsed from concept to retail stores. Additional key launches are planned for 2018, including a major Safety 1 st travel system and a Maxi-Cosi car seat to be manufactured and sold in North America.\nDorel Sports All figures in thousands of US $ Fourth Quarters Ended December 30 (unaudited) 2017 2016 Change $ % of rev. $ % of rev. % Total revenue 236,771 235,253 0.6 % Gross profit 52,105 22.0 % 47,998 20.4 % 8.6 % Operating profit 9,613 4.1 % 4,965 2.1 % 93.6 % Adjusted gross profit 51,386 21.7 % 50,417 21.4 % 1.9 % Adjusted operating profit 9,252 3.9 % 10,153 4.3 % (8.9 %) All figures in thousands of US $ Years Ended December 30 (unaudited) 2017 2016 Change $ % of rev. $ % of rev. % Total revenue 865,380 938,975 (7.8 %) Gross profit 194,940 22.5 % 196,201 20.9 % (0.6 %) Operating profit (loss) 24,831 2.9 % (33,930 ) (3.6 %) 173.2 % Adjusted gross profit 193,625 22.4 % 201,322 21.4 % (3.8 %) Adjusted operating profit 24,972 2.9 % 31,538 3.4 % (20.8 %) Fourth quarter revenue increased US$1.5 million, or 0.6%, to US$236.8 million from US$235.3 million last year. Excluding the positive impact of foreign exchange rates, organic revenue declined by approximately 1.4%. Full year revenue decreased US$73.6 million, or 7.8%, to US$865.4 million compared to US$939.0 million a year ago. Organic revenue for the full year declined by approximately 11% when removing foreign exchange fluctuations and the change in Cycling Sports Group (CSG) International’s business model for which the revenue recognition transitioned from a licensing model to a distribution platform in the third quarter of 2016.\nDespite a continued weak global bike market, Dorel Sports grew its fourth quarter top line thanks to strong performances in CSG’s International business and at Caloi. The segment’s revenue improved considerably from the third quarter despite the continuing challenging global bicycle market, particularly in North America. Sales in CSG decreased slightly due to the competitive environment and a generally soft industry globally at independent bicycle dealers. Several new model year ’18 products were launched, including the revitalized Synapse, Trail and Kids platforms, which are all core pillars of the Cannondale product offering. Sales of these units increased over 50% in the fourth quarter, compared to prior year. Parts and accessories sales also increased as did sales of the new line of Mongoose scooters. Caloi improved its top line due to the on-going stabilization of the Brazilian economy, combined with the success of new product launches of the Caloi and Cannondale brands in Brazil. Inventory remains in a healthy position, finishing the fourth quarter with the lowest level in two years.\nFourth quarter operating profit increased US$4.6 million to US$9.6 million and when excluding restructuring and other costs, adjusted operating profit declined by US$0.9 million to US$9.3 million. For the year, operating profit was US$24.8 million compared to an operating loss a year ago of US$33.9 million. Excluding impairment losses, restructuring and other costs, adjusted operating profit declined by US$6.6 million, or 20.8%, to US$25.0 million. The change in adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter when compared to 2016 is explained by increased selling expenses offset by improved adjusted gross profit which increased by 30 basis points to 21.7%. For the year, the change in adjusted operating profit is explained by lower revenue, partly offset by improved adjusted gross profit which increased by 100 basis points to 22.4%. This is due to continued inventory management improvement in terms of product mix and pricing actions in key markets.\nOther\nThe Company’s effective tax rate was an expense of 36.3% in 2017 compared to a recovery of 46.2% in 2016. Excluding income taxes on impairment losses, restructuring and other costs, remeasurement of forward purchase agreement liabilities and loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt, the Company’s adjusted tax rate was 22.5% in 2017 compared with 7.1% in 2016. The main cause of the year-over-year increase in the adjusted tax rate was changes in the jurisdictions in which the Company generated its income. The overall impact related to tax rate changes in the Company’s various jurisdictions from 2016 to 2017 was a net benefit of US$2.0 million.\nThe effective tax rate for 2018 is expected to be between 20% and 25%, incorporating the U.S. Tax Reform signed into law on December 22, 2017 that reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. The U.S. Tax Reform introduces other important changes to U.S. corporate income tax laws, which are not expected to significantly impact the Company in future years.\nOutlook\n“E-commerce opportunities continue to emerge and Dorel Home is capitalizing on them with its broad product assortment and company-wide logistics expertise. As the leader in supplying on-line retailers, we expect further growth in Dorel Home revenue, with continued operating profit improvement through 2018,” stated Dorel President & CEO, Martin Schwartz.\n“Dorel Juvenile has begun to introduce several significant new products and will continue to do so throughout the year. This expanded product portfolio is expected to result in higher revenue and improved adjusted operating profit in 2018. We are forecasting further e-commerce growth for this segment, as we are gaining traction and market share on-line within our product categories. Current first quarter expectations are for lower adjusted operating profit than prior year, with the stated improvements to commence thereafter.\n“Driven by new, innovative products across all price points, Dorel Sports is expected to deliver higher sales and better operating profit in 2018. This improvement is expected in all three of our principal channels: mass market, independent bike dealers and sporting goods. While there are less e-commerce sales opportunities within Dorel Sports’ product categories, our focus on compelling on-line content is driving consumer awareness to our brands. As with Dorel Juvenile, the first quarter of 2017 was strong for Dorel Sports, therefore the improved operating profit is expected in the second quarter onward.\n“In 2017, we continued to see changes in the traditional retail brick and mortar retail sales channel and our Company-wide strategic focus on e-commerce has allowed us to offset most of these challenges. Should there be a further decline in the financial condition of these at-risk retailers, this could have a short-term negative impact on our overall expectations for the year,” concluded Mr. Schwartz.\nConference Call\nDorel Industries Inc. will hold a conference call to discuss these results today, March 8, 2018 at 1:00 P.M.

(TSX:DII.B) (TSX:DII.A) is a global organization, operating three distinct businesses in juvenile products, bicycles and home products.

Except as may be required by Canadian securities laws, Dorel does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Forward-looking statements, by their very nature, are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and are based on several assumptions which give rise to the possibility that actual results could differ materially from Dorel’s expectations expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements and that the objectives, plans, strategic priorities and business outlook may not be achieved. As a result, Dorel cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will materialize, or if any of them do, what benefits Dorel will derive from them. Forward-looking statements are provided in this press release for the purpose of giving information about Management’s current expectations and plans and allowing investors and others to get a better understanding of Dorel’s operating environment. However, readers are cautioned that it may not be appropriate to use such forward-looking statements for any other purpose.\nForward-looking statements made in this press release are based on a number of assumptions that Dorel believed were reasonable on the day it made the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from Dorel’s expectations expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements include: general economic conditions; changes in product costs and supply channels; foreign currency fluctuations; customer and credit risk, including the concentration of revenues with small number of customers; costs associated with product liability; changes in income tax legislation or the interpretation or application of those rules; the continued ability to develop products and support brand names; changes in the regulatory environment; continued access to capital resources and the related costs of borrowing; changes in assumptions in the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets; and there being no certainty that Dorel’s current dividend policy will be maintained. These and other risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements are discussed in Dorel’s annual Management Discussion and Analysis and Annual Information Form filed with the applicable Canadian securities regulatory authorities. The risk factors outlined in the previously-mentioned documents are specifically incorporated herein by reference.\nDorel cautions readers that the risks described above are not the only ones that could impact it. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to Dorel or that Dorel currently deems to be immaterial may also have a material adverse effect on Dorel’s business, financial condition or results of operations. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.\nNon-GAAP financial measures\nAs a result of impairment losses, restructuring and other costs, remeasurement of forward purchase agreement liabilities and loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt incurred in 2017 and 2016, the Company is including in this press release the following non-GAAP financial measures: “adjusted cost of sales”, “adjusted gross profit”, “adjusted operating profit (loss)”, “adjusted finance expenses”, “adjusted income before income taxes”, “adjusted income taxes expense (recovery)”, “adjusted tax rate”, “adjusted net income”, “adjusted earnings per basic and diluted share” and “adjusted diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding”. The Company believes that this results in a more meaningful comparison of its core business performance between the periods presented. These non-GAAP financial measures do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Contained within this press release are reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n(All figures in the tables below are in thousands of US$, except per share amounts)\nReconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures Fourth Quarters Ended December 30, 2017 2016 Reported % of\nrevenue Impairment losses, restructuring and\nother costs Adjusted % of\nrevenue Reported % of\nrevenue Restructuring\nand other costs Adjusted % of\nrevenue $ % $ $ % $ % $ $ % TOTAL REVENUE 677,052 100.0 -
