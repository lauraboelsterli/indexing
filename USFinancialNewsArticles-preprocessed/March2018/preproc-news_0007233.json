    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The following statement is being issued by Levi & Korsinsky, LLP:\nTo: All persons or entities who acquired shares in the LJM Preservation and Growth Fund (NASDAQ:LJMIX) offered by LJM Funds Management Ltd., between February 28, 2015 and February 7, 2018 (“LJMIX” or “the Company”) . You are hereby notified that a securities class action lawsuit has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.

Levi, Esq. either via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500, toll-free: (877) 363-5972. There is no cost or obligation to you.\nThe complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, defendants made materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) LJMIX was not focused on capital preservation and left investors exposed to an unacceptably high risk of catastrophic losses; and (2) LJMIX had not taken appropriate steps to preserve capital in down markets.\nIf you suffered a loss in LJMIX you have until April 10, 2018 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn’t require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.\nLevi & Korsinsky is a national firm with offices in New York, California, Connecticut, and Washington D.C.
