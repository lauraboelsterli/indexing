    "text": "LONGUEUIL, Québec, March 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stornoway Diamond Corporation (TSX-SWY; the “Corporation” or “Stornoway”) is pleased to report financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nEarnings, operating expenses and capital expenses Quote: d reflect the recent adoption of a change in accounting policy regarding the capitalization of certain underground mine development costs (see “ Change in Accounting Policy ” below).\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Highlights:\n(All Quote: d figures in CAD$, unless otherwise noted)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Stornoway reported net loss of $114.6 million ($0.14 per share on a basic and fully diluted basis), compared to net income of $19.6 million in 2016 ($0.03 per share basic and fully diluted). Included in 2017 earnings is a non-cash impairment charge of $171.0 million, reflecting a lower diamond price environment than was originally forecast by the Corporation. Net income before impairment 1 was $11.1 million for the fourth quarter and $15.0 million for the year. During 2017, the Renard Diamond Mine attained commercial production, completed the processing ramp-up on schedule and accomplished two full quarters at or above plant nameplate operating capacity. Mining in the Renard 2-3 and Renard 65 open pits in the fourth quarter comprised 827,181 tonnes, with 442,476 tonnes of ore extracted. For the full year, open pit mining stood at 4,475,854 tonnes (102% of plan), with 2,091,782 tonnes of ore extracted. A total of 398,267 carats were recovered in the fourth quarter from the processing of 518,817 tonnes of ore at a grade of 77 carats per hundred tonnes (“cpht”). For the full year, a total of 1,642,934 carats were recovered from 1,956,436 tonnes of ore at 84 cpht (98%, 97% and 99% of plan respectively). Diamond sales of 486,633 carats 2 were completed in the fourth quarter with gross proceeds1 , 3 of $52.6 million at an average price of US$86 per carat ($108 per carat 4 ). For the full year, Stornoway sold 1,701,561 carats for gross proceeds 1,3 of $186.2 million at an average price of US$85 per carat ($109 per carat 5 ). In the fourth quarter, cash operating costs per tonne processed 1,[6] were $42.10 per tonne ($54.85 per carat) and capital expenditures 1,6 were $47.7 million. For the full year, cash operating costs per tonne processed 1,6 were $45.02 per tonne ($53.60 per carat) and capital expenditures 1,6 were $126.9 million. In the fourth quarter, the Corporation reported adjusted EBITDA 1,6 of $25.2 million, or 45.5% of revenues, and $85.0 million, or 43.3% of revenues, for the full year ended December 31, 2017. At year end, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments stood at $81.0 million and available liquidity 1 to the Corporation, including available credit facilities, stood at $101.8 million.\n1 See “Non-IFRS Financial Measures” section\n2 Including 32,989 carats that were sold in the third quarter for which revenue was realized in the fourth quarter.\n3 Before stream and royalty\n4 Based on an average $:US$ conversion rate of $1.26\n5 Based on an average $:US$ conversion rate of $1.29\n6 See “Change in Accounting Policy” section\nMatt Manson, President and CEO, commented: “In 2017, Stornoway’s Renard Diamond Mine produced a strong performance in mining, carat production, processing ramp-up, and cost. It has delivered strong operating margins, with EBITDA of $85 million, despite the lower diamond pricing environment that has characterised our first year of sales. As 2017 ended, Renard had established itself as the lowest cost diamond mine in Canada, and Renard diamonds had developed a strong position in the rough diamond market. The first half of 2018 will see ore production transition from our starter open pit to our underground mine. Ensuring an efficient ramp-up of the underground operations is a key priority for the Renard team. At the same time, we are introducing our new ore-waste sorting circuit designed to improve the quality of our diamond production and provide future processing expansion capacity. Both of these capital projects, once completed, will define the character of the project for the next decade.” Mr. Manson continued, “Since the completion of our project fund-raising in 2014, and through four years of mine construction and operations, Stornoway has maintained a strong balance sheet and liquidity position. This will remain a priority for us in our financial management as we pass through the scheduled capital spending of 2018 and pursue the production and revenue growth potential of our business.”\nTable 1. Financial Results Highlights\n(expressed in millions of Canadian dollars, except as otherwise noted)\nThree months ended Year ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2017 Ore mined (tonnes) 490,237 2,218,385 Waste mined (tonnes) 444,058 2,704,560 Ore processed (tonnes) 518,816 1,956,435 Carats Recovered 398,267 1,642,934 Carats Sold 2 486,633 1,701,561 Revenues 55.5 196.5 Cost of Goods Sold 43.2 149.2 Impairment charge 171.0 171.0 Selling, General, Administrative and Exploration Expenses 4.6 19.9 Financial and other (income) expenses 3.1 7.6 Foreign exchange (gain) loss 0.7 (7.9 ) Net (loss) income (118.6 ) (114.6 ) Net (loss) income per Share – Basic and Diluted (0.14 ) (0.14 ) Net income before impairment 1 11.1 15.0 Adjusted EBITDA 1 25.2 85.0 Adjusted EBITDA margin (%) 1 45 % 43 % Capital expenditures 1 47.6 126.9 Financial Summary\nRevenue for the fourth quarter is estimated at $55.5 million, and at $196.5 million for the full year FY2017. Revenue includes amortization of upfront proceeds received by the Corporation under the Renard Stream Agreement in consideration for future commitments to deliver diamonds at contracted prices.\nUnder the changed accounting policy, the Corporation reported FY2017 Adjusted EBITDA 1,6 of $85.0 million, or 43.3% of revenue. The Corporation incurred a non-cash impairment charge of $171.0 million as at December 31, 2017 on the carrying value of the Corporation’s property plant and equipment, reflecting an outlook of lower than expected diamond pricing. Prior to this charge, the Corporation reported net income before impairment 1 for FY2017 of $15.0 million.\nDuring the fourth quarter the Corporation drew down funds available under its senior loan facility with Diaquem Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ressources Québec) prior to its scheduled expiry at year-end, and made $16.0 million of principal repayments on existing indebtedness. As at December 31, 2017, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments stood at $81.0 million and Available Liquidity 1 to the Corporation, including available credit facilities, stood at $101.8 million.\nChange in Accounting Policy\nThe fourth quarter and full year FY2017 results incorporate the impact of an accounting policy change recently adopted by the Corporation in accordance with IAS 8 “ Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors” wherein certain costs associated with the development of the underground mine that were previously expensed will now be capitalized and amortized over the period during which the underground infrastructure can be expected to contribute to the revenue-earning capability of the mine. Mining companies use different accounting treatments on development expenditure incurred during the production phase. This change will result in the financial statements providing reliable and more relevant information on Stornoway’s financial performance, such as operating expense, capital expense, and earnings.\nTable 2 illustrates a reconciliation certain financial and operating metrics impacted by the accounting policy change for the three 2017 interim consolidated financial statements of the Corporation.\nTable 2.

Average daily manpower at site in December averaged 324 workers (Stornoway and contractors) of which 12% were Crees of the Eeyou Istchee. Stornoway employees stood at 505 as at December 31, 2017, including 437 mine located employees, of which 12% were Crees, 26% were from Chibougamau and Chapais, and 62% were from outside the region. One incident of administrative environmental non‐conformity was identified during the quarter due to reporting an accidental glycol spill outside of the 24-hour prescribed delay.\nCommercial Production, Ramp-Up and Completion Certification\nStornoway formally declared commercial production at the Renard Diamond Mine on January 1, 2017, marking the end of the project’s initial capital expense period. Production ramp-up was completed on schedule at the end of the second quarter of 2017, with an average processing rate of 6,149 tonnes per day achieved in June 2017. Since then, two full operating quarters have been completed at average processing rates of 5,957 tonnes per day and 6,014 tonnes per day respectively.\nSubsequent to the year end, on February 7, 2018, the Corporation announced the attainment of full Completion Certification at the Renard Mine pursuant to the terms of Stornoway’s July 2014 material project finance agreements.\nMining and Processing\nDuring the fourth quarter, 827,181 tonnes were mined from the Renard 2-3 and Renard 65 open pits, with 442,476 tonnes of ore extracted. 518,817 tonnes of ore from the Renard 2 and Renard 3 kimberlites were processed with a diamond recovery of 398,267 carats at an attributable grade of 77cpht.\nDuring the year, 4,475,854 tonnes were mined from the Renard 2-3 and Renard 65 open pits, compared to a plan of 4,369,532 tonnes (102%), with 2,091,782 tonnes of ore extracted. 1,956,436 tonnes of ore were processed with a diamond recovery of 1,642,934 carats at an attributable grade of 84cpht, compared to a plan of 1,999,000 tonnes and 1,694,312 carats at 85 cpht (98%, 97% and 99% respectively).\nCarat production was lower than planned in the fourth quarter and on a full year basis, due to the unscheduled batch processing of lower grade Renard 65 ore in November for the purpose of obtaining a valuation sample of Renard 65 diamonds.\nIn the fourth quarter, cash operating costs per tonne processed 1,6 were $42.10 per tonne ($54.85 per carat recovered 1,6 ). On a full year basis, cash operating costs per tonne processed 1,6 were $45.02 per tonne ($53.60 per carat recovered 1,6 ). Under the changed accounting policy, cash operating costs are lower and capital expenditures are higher than was contemplated in the 2017 guidance.\nDiamond Sales\nDuring the fourth quarter, Stornoway sold a total of 486,633 2 carats in 2 tender sales with gross proceeds 1,3 of $52.6 million, at an average price of US$86 per carat ($108 per carat 4 ). On a full year basis Stornoway sold 1,701,561 carats for gross proceeds 1,3 of $186.2 million, at an average price of US$85 per carat ($109 per carat 5 ).\nCommentary on Diamond Production and the Rough Diamond Market\nDuring 2017, the quality and size distribution of diamond recoveries at Renard were negatively impacted by high levels of diamond damage incurred during processing, producing a commensurate reduction in the average price achieved at sale. The Corporation believes that significant value improvement may be achieved upon successful mitigation of the breakage to more acceptable levels. The source of the breakage has been localized, primarily, within the secondary cone crusher and tertiary high pressure grinding roll crusher, and appears associated with the high proportion of hard, internal dilution inherent in Renard ore producing an abrasive environment within the crushers. The Corporation believes that the introduction of ore-waste sorting, approved under an extraordinary capital plan by the Board of Directors in August 2017, will contribute to a higher quality diamond product through the removal of a large proportion of the abrasive dilution from the crushing circuits. Commissioning of the new ore-waste sorting circuit is expected to commence shortly.\nBetween the first sale of Renard diamonds in November 2016, and the tenth sale in December 2017, the average run of mine pricing for Renard diamonds, after accounting for size distribution and quality variations, increased in real terms by 13.5%. This increasing trend reflected a positive reaction by the rough market to the qualities, colours and polished yields of the Renard diamond production, and increasing participation in the Corporation’s diamond tenders. This result was attained despite a challenging rough diamond market in 2017, which was characterized by an increase in sales from rough producers (including from three new diamond mining projects) and flat to low sales growth for polished diamonds and diamond jewellery. These market conditions were exacerbated by the Indian demonetization events of late 2016, which impacted rough diamond pricing for smaller and lower quality items during the course of 2017. By year end, the effect of the Indian demonetization event had largely been removed from the rough diamond market, and a strong holiday selling season, particularly in Asian markets, had resulted in moderate price growth at the start of 2018 for both rough and polished diamonds.\nSubsequent to the year end, the Corporation announced on January 29, 2018 that in the first tender of 2018 it had sold 138,687 carats were sold for gross proceeds 1,3 of US$14.4 million at an average price of US$104 per carat. This is the highest price for Renard diamonds achieved to date, and reflected the strengthening diamond market and appreciable improvements in breakage levels, size distribution and quality mix.\nCapital Projects\nUnder the changed accounting policy, capital expenditures 1,6 in the fourth quarter were $47.7 million, primarily related to the development of the underground mine and the construction of the ore-waste sorting circuit. For the year ended December 31, 2017, capital expenditures 1,6 stood at $126.9 million. Under the changed accounting policy, cash operating costs are lower and capital expenditures are higher than was contemplated in the 2017 guidance.\nDevelopment of the underground mine during the fourth quarter focussed on lateral development in kimberlite and waste for the drill drift on levels 160, 240 and 270, and also for the draw-points on level 290. Development of the fresh air raise was also completed during this period. Lateral development comprised 1,227 meters compared to a plan of 1,062 meters (+16%). On a yearly basis, lateral development stood at 4,869 meters compared to a plan of 4,460 meters (+9%).\nThe first production blast in the underground mine occurred successfully on December 20 th , 2017. Full production from the underground mine is on schedule to commence within the second quarter of 2018.\nUpdated FY2018 Guidance\nUnder the changed accounting policy, cash operating costs 1 in FY2018 are expected to be $48 to $50 per tonne processed ($75 to $77 per carat recovered), and capital expenditures 1 are expected to be $100 million. This compares to previous FY2018 guidance of $56 to $58 per tonne processed ($87 to $92 per carat recovered) and $82 million of capital expenditures 1 . Other FY2018 guidance (Table 3) is un-impacted by the accounting changes.\nTable 3. Updated FY2018 Guidance\n(expressed in millions of Canadian dollars, except as otherwise noted) MINING AND PROCESSING Open Pit Tonnes Mined 2.7 million Underground Tonnes Mined 2.2 million Tonnes Processed 2.5 million Carats Recovered 1.6 million Grade (cpht) 65 Cash Operating Cost per Tonne Processed $48-50 Cash Operating Cost per Carat Recovered $75-77 SELLING AND MARKETING Carats Sold (+7 DTC) 1.1 million Carats Sold (-7 DTC) 0.5 million Average Diamond Pricing (+7 DTC) US$ 125-165 Average Diamond Pricing (-7 DTC) US$ 15-19 CAPITAL Capital Expenditures $100 million Mineral Reserves Update\nMineral Reserves as of December 31, 2017 have been updated based on mining depletion. At December 31, 2016, Proven and Probable Mineral Reserves for the Renard Diamond Mine were 30.2 million tonnes at a grade of 66.3 carats per hundred tonnes (“cpht”) for 20.0 million attributable carats.\nExclusive of the Mineral Reserves, the Renard Diamond Mine includes additional Indicated Mineral Resources of 2.8 million carats (6.1 million tonnes at 46 cpht), Inferred Mineral Resources of 13.1 million carats (23.4 million tonnes at 56 cpht), and 33.0 to 71.1 million carats of non-resource exploration upside (76.2 to 113.2 million tonnes at grades ranging from 20 to 168 cpht). Readers are cautioned that the potential quantity and grade of any such exploration target is conceptual in nature, there has been insufficient exploration to define a mineral resource, and it is uncertain if further exploration will result in the target being delineated as a mineral resource. All kimberlites remain open at depth. The 2017 Updated Mineral Resource incorporates geological data on kimberlite contacts and internal geology as revealed on the 160 meter, 270 meter and 290 meter levels in the Renard underground mine.\nNon-IFRS Financial Measures\nThis document refers to certain financial measures, such as Net Income Before Impairment, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Average Diamond Pricing Achieved, Cash Operating Cost per Tonne Processed, Cash Operating Cost per Carat Recovered, Capital Expenditures, and Available Liquidity, which are not measures recognized under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. As a result, these measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other corporations.\nEach of these measures have been derived from the Corporation’s financial statements and have been defined and calculated based on management’s reasonable judgement.

These risk factors may be generally stated as the risk that the assumptions and estimates expressed above do not occur, including the assumption in many forward-looking statements that other forward-looking statements will be correct, but specifically include, without limitation: (i) risks relating to variations in the grade, size distribution and quality of diamonds, kimberlite lithologies and country rock content within the material identified as Mineral Resources from that predicted; (ii) variations in rates of recovery and levels of diamond breakage; (iii) the uncertainty as to whether further exploration of exploration targets will result in the targets being delineated as Mineral Resources; (iv) risks associated with our dependence on the Renard Diamond Mine and the limited operating history thereof; (v) unfavorable developments in general economic conditions and in world diamond markets; (vi) variations in diamond valuations and fluctuations in diamond prices from those assumed; (vii) insufficient demand and market acceptance of our diamonds; (viii) risks associated with the production and increased consumer demand for synthetic gem-quality diamonds; (ix) risks relating to fluctuations in the Canadian dollar and other currencies relative to the US dollar and variability in interest rates; (x) inaccuracy of our estimates regarding future financing and capital requirements and expenditures, significant additional future capital needs and unavailability of additional financing and capital, on reasonable terms, or at all; (xi) uncertainties related to forecasts, costs and timing of the Corporation’s future development plans, exploration, processing, production and mining activities; (xii) increases in the costs of proposed capital, operating and sustainable capital expenditures; (xiii) increases in financing costs or adverse changes to the terms of available financing, if any; (xiv) tax rates or royalties being greater than assumed; (xv) uncertainty of mine life extension potential and results of exploration in areas of potential expansion of resources; (xvi) changes in development or mining plans due to changes in other factors or exploration results; (xvii) risks relating to the receipt of regulatory approvals or the implementation of the existing Impact and Benefits Agreement with aboriginal communities; (xviii) the failure to secure and maintain skilled employees and maintain key relationships with financing partners, local communities and other stakeholders; (xix) risks associated with ongoing issues of diamond breakage in the Renard Diamond Mine process plant and the failure to realize the anticipated benefits from plant modification measures within the anticipated timeframe and expected capital cost, or at all; (xx) the negative market effects of recent Indian demonetization and continued impact on pricing and demand; (xxi) the effects of competition in the markets in which Stornoway operates; (xxii) operational and infrastructure risks; (xxiii) execution risk relating to the development of an operating mine at the Renard Diamond Mine; (xxiv) the Corporation being unable to meet its Subject Diamonds Interest delivery obligations under the Purchase and Sale Agreement; (xxv) future sales or issuances of Common Shares lowering the Common Share price and diluting the interest of existing shareholders; (xxvi) the risk of failure of information systems; (xxvii) the risk that our insurance does not cover all potential risks; (xxviii) the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness and the failure to meet our debt service obligations; and (xxix) the additional risk factors described herein and in Stornoway’s annual and interim MD&A, its other disclosure documents and Stornoway’s anticipation of and success in managing the foregoing risks. Stornoway cautions that the foregoing list of factors that may affect future results is not exhaustive and new, unforeseeable risks may arise from time to time.\nSource: Stornoway Diamond Corporation",
