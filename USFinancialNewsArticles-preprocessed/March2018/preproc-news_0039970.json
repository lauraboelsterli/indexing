    "text": "Additional agreements result in sale of Steve Wynn's remaining holdings in Wynn Resorts\nHONG KONG and LAS VEGAS, March 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Galaxy Entertainment Group (HKEx stock code: 27) and Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ: WYNN) today announced that Galaxy Entertainment has agreed to purchase 5.3 million primary shares of Wynn Resorts at a price of $175 a share, resulting in $927,500,000 of gross proceeds to Wynn Resorts.\nGalaxy Entertainment Group Vice Chairman Francis Lui said, \"This is a unique opportunity to acquire an investment in a globally recognized entertainment corporation with exceptionally high quality assets and a significant development pipeline.\"\n\"It is an honor to have such a distinguished company as Galaxy Entertainment as a shareholder which shares many of the same core operating philosophies and values,\" said Wynn Resorts CEO Matt Maddox.\nIn addition, two long-term institutional investors, both of whom are currently investors in Wynn Resorts, have agreed to purchase the remaining eight million shares held by founder and former Wynn Resorts CEO Steve Wynn, thus demonstrating their confidence in the long-term strength of the company. The purchase price of the shares held by Mr. Wynn is also $175 a share. The two sales, combined with previous sales by Mr. Wynn, effectively eliminate his ownership in Wynn Resorts.\nToday's announcement follows the settlement two weeks ago of long-standing litigation between Wynn Resorts and Universal Entertainment Corporation. The resolution of that litigation, combined with the new agreement with Galaxy Entertainment Group and the liquidation of Steve Wynn's shares in the company positions Wynn Resorts for even greater stability, strategic focus and future growth.\nAbout Galaxy Entertainment Group (HKEx stock code: 27)\nGalaxy Entertainment Group (\"GEG\" or the \"Group\") is one of the world's leading resorts, hospitality and gaming companies. It primarily develops and operates a large portfolio of integrated resort, retail, dining, hotel and gaming facilities in Macau.

When The Next Chapter of its Cotai development is completed, GEG's resorts footprint on Cotai will double to more than 2 million square meters, making the resorts, entertainment and MICE precinct one of the largest and most diverse integrated destinations in the world. GEG is also planning to develop a world class leisure and recreation destination resort on a 2.7 square kilometer land parcel on Hengqin adjacent to Macau.
