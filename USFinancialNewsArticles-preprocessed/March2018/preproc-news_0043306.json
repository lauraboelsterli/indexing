    "text": "NEW YORK, March 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Scott+Scott Attorneys at Law LLP (\"Scott+Scott\"), a national shareholder and consumer rights litigation firm, filed a class action lawsuit against Facebook, Inc. (\"Facebook\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: FB) and certain of its executives (collectively, \"Defendants\"). If you purchased or otherwise acquired common shares of Facebook between February 3, 2017 and March 19, 2018, you are encouraged to contact a Scott+Scott attorney at (844) 818-6982 for more information.\nThe lawsuit relates to Facebook user privacy and alleges that the Defendants made misleading statements to investors.\nOn March 17, 2018, The New York Times reported that voter-profiling company Cambridge Analytica \"harvested private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users without their permission, according to former Cambridge employees, associates and documents, making it one of the largest data leaks in the social network's history.\"\nThe next day, March 18, 2018, the Massachusetts Attorney General said her office was launching an investigation into Facebook. On March 19, 2018, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and European Union officials also said they would investigate.\nOn this news, the price of Facebook stock fell nearly 6.8% on March 19, 2018.\nOn March 20, 2018, several media outlets reported that the United Kingdom Parliament had summoned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to give evidence related to the Cambridge Analytica news. Following these news reports, Facebook's share price fell an additional $4.41, or 2.5%, on March 20, 2018.\nOn March 26, 2018, the Federal Trade Commission confirmed it had opened a non-public investigation into Facebook's privacy practices. On this news, the stock price fell further, trading at $155.44 intraday, a greater than 16% drop from the March 16, 2018 close price.\nWhat You Can Do\nIf you wish to discuss this action or have any questions concerning this notice or your rights or interests, please contact plaintiff's counsel, Joe Pettigrew of Scott+Scott at (844) 818-6982, or at jpettigrew@scott-scott.com .
