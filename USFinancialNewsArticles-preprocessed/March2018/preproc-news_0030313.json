Additionally, the Company announced a change to its management structure and investment strategy including key new appointments, departures and a strategic shift in direction focusing on investments in healthcare companies, capitalizing on the expertise of the newly-installed management team.\nUnder the previous advisory, the BDC focused on debt and commercial assets; however, the newly-appointed management is streamlining its strategic focus to healthcare not only to capitalize on the deep and wide market opportunity but to also better align with the new management’s extensive executive, scientific, and commercial experience in healthcare that spans biopharmaceuticals, medical technologies, diagnostics and other key verticals within the industry.\nTo best execute this strategic shift and re-positioned focus on healthcare companies, the Board announced new key management appointments that each carry decades of sector expertise that underscore the value they bring to the BDC’s portfolio companies. The Board appointed Derek Taller, Ph.D., as Chief Executive Officer, Reid Maclellan, M.D., as Chief Operating Officer and Paul Saint-Pierre as Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary. Biographies of each of these three Officers can be found below.\nIn conjunction with his management role, the Board also appointed Mr. Saint-Pierre as interim Chairman of the Board of First Capital until a new Chairman is appointed at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Brian Wall has also resigned from his position as Financial Consultant for FCIC.\nMr. Singal commented, “This acquisition and decision to focus the Company’s strategic direction maximizes value for our shareholders by aligning our best resources along with some of the industry’s top talent in an area where we are not only seeing the most growth but feel we can also add the most value in driving innovation and returns. The accomplished pedigrees of the newly-appointed management underscore our confidence in Derek, Reid and Paul’s team to lead the Company with a new vision.”\nDr. Taller added, “I’m very proud and looking forward to leading the charge on delivering a vision to apply our talent and experience in building new generations of innovative medtech and biopharma companies. Our vision is to drive StHealth to become recognized as a premier development stage vehicle. With our technical and commercial expertise that we have accumulated from managing multiple healthcare-focused portfolios combined with our academic and medical training, our team has all the key ingredients to produce profoundly innovative healthcare solutions backed by solid and sustainable business models.”\nDerek Taller, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer\nDr. Derek Taller currently serves as the Chief Executive Officer of StHealth Capital and previously served as Managing Director of LG Investments, a New York-based Multi-Family Office.
