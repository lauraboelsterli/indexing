    "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German carmakers Daimler and BMW have joined forces to expand their businesses in new services such as car-sharing and electric vehicle charging, raising their full-year guidance to reflect the deal.\nFILE PHOTO: A man walks past an electric car from the car sharing company Car2Go, shown parked in front of their offices in San Diego, California September 1, 2015. REUTERS/Mike Blake /File Photo Mercedes-owner Daimler and BMW, Germany’s two biggest luxury carmakers, are preparing for a new era in mobility services where self-driving cars could allow them to expand into a business segment currently dominated by Uber in the United States and Didi Chuxing in China.\nUnder the terms of the deal, which includes car-sharing units Car2Go and DriveNow as well as ride-hailing, parking and charging services, Daimler and BMW will each hold a 50 percent stake in a joint venture.\nAssuming that regulators approve the transaction, both companies expect their key profit figures — earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) for Daimler and pretax profit for BMW — to rise slightly year-on-year, compared with previous guidance for flat profit.\nReporting by Edward Taylor; Writing by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Keith Weir\n ",
