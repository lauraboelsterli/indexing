Decker, Jr., IRET's President and CEO. \"With the previously-announced sales of our healthcare properties, apartment communities now comprise more than 90% of our portfolio, and with the pending acquisition in Denver, our redeployment is nearly finished. Our team completed the transformation we set out to achieve, and we can now focus the full attention of our organization on improving our operational performance and growing and refining our apartment portfolio.\"\nThird Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Highlights\nSubstantially completed our transformation into a focused multifamily company by closing the sale of 27 of our 28 healthcare properties for an aggregate sale price of approximately $400.8 million. The final property remains under contract for sale pending the satisfaction of certain closing conditions. We used the proceeds from the sale of these assets to fund acquisitions and reduce debt. Closed the acquisition of Dylan, a 274-home apartment community in Denver, Colorado, completing our inaugural investment in another top-25 MSA. Subsequent to quarter-end, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire Westend, another Denver apartment community with 390 homes. Denver has a healthy and diverse economy and, together with Minneapolis-St. Paul, will be a key market in IRET's push to achieve portfolio growth, geographic diversity, and operating efficiencies. Achieved quarterly same-store NOI growth of 5.8% over the same period in the prior year, representing the first positive result in over two years. This performance was driven by revenue growth of 5.2%, due primarily to a 4.4% increase in occupancy, and expense growth of 4.5%. The reduction in expense growth this quarter compared to the 15.0% increase in first half of fiscal 2018 is due, in part, to a decrease in snow removal costs and a reduction in accruals related to self-funded healthcare costs. Reduced debt from $928.0 million to $692.9 million during the quarter and have $116.8 million of restricted cash available to deploy toward future acquisitions. Closed a $70 million unsecured term loan that expires in 2023 and executed a swap agreement to synthetically fix the interest rate for the full duration of the loan.\nAcquisitions\nWe added one new property to our portfolio during the quarter:\n(in thousands)\nProperty Name\nLocation\nTotal Units\nTotal Cost\n% Occupied\nas of 1/31/2018\nDylan\nDenver, CO\n274\n$\n90,600\n81.4\n%\nSubsequent to quarter-end, we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire Westend, another Denver apartment community with 390 homes.\nDispositions\nDuring the quarter, we sold 27 healthcare properties for $400.8 million, two other properties for $35.4 million, and two multifamily properties for $6.7 million.\nSubsequent to quarter-end, we sold a commercial property and adjacent parcel of unimproved land in Bismarck, ND, for an aggregate sale price of $5.5 million.\nBalance Sheet\nAt the end of the third quarter, we had $174.8 million of total liquidity on our balance sheet, including $152.2 million available on our corporate revolver.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased and retired approximately 152,000 common shares and redeemed approximately 450,000 Units for an aggregate cost of approximately $3.5 million, representing an average price of approximately $5.78 per share. We also closed on a $70 million unsecured term loan that matures in 2023 and executed a swap agreement to synthetically fix the interest rate for the full duration of the loan.\nQuarterly Distributions\nOn March 5, 2018, IRET's Board of Trustees declared a regular quarterly distribution of $0.07 per share/unit payable on April 2, 2018, to common shareholders and unitholders of record on March 15, 2018.
