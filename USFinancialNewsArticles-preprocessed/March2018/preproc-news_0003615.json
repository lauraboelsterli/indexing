Excluding hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and the California wildfires, the combined ratio would have been 90.5%.\nExcluding Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and the California wildfires, the current accident year property loss ratio would have been 57.9%.\nThe current accident year casualty loss ratio improved 0.8 points to 66.1% in 2017 from 66.9% in 2016 primarily due to lower reported claims frequency.\nCalendar year results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 include a 12.3 point reduction in the loss ratio related to prior accident years, which was primarily driven by lower than expected claims frequency and severity experienced across multiple prior accident years within Commercial Lines, lower than expected case incurred emergence primarily related to the 2016 accident year within Personal Lines, as well as a reduction related to the Company’s property treaties for multiple prior accident years within the Reinsurance Operations.\nGlobal Indemnity Limited’s Gross and Net Premiums Written Results by Segment for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, Gross Premiums Written Net Premiums Written 2017 2016 2017 2016 Commercial Lines Operations $ 212,471 $ 188,571 $ 186,322 $ 169,291 Personal Lines Operations 250,044 263,714 208,776 224,484 Reinsurance Operations 53,887 59,837 53,933 59,801 Runoff 1,270 18,389 1,149 17,364 Business Fronted for Assurant (1,338 ) 35,334 - - Total $ 516,334 $ 565,845 $ 450,180 $ 470,940 Commercial Lines Operations: Gross premiums written and net premiums written increased 12.7% and 10.1%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. This increase is mainly due to the introduction of several new programs and organic growth in other lines.\nPersonal Lines Operations: Gross premiums written and net premiums written decreased 5.2% and 7.0%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in gross premiums written was primarily due to a targeted reduction of catastrophe exposed business.\nReinsurance Operations: Gross premiums written and net premiums written decreased 9.9% and 9.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, as compared to the same period in 2016 mainly due to a reduction in premiums written related to a mortgage insurance treaty.\nNote: Tables Follow\nGlobal Indemnity Limited\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n(Dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data)\nFor the Three Months\nEnded December 31, For the Twelve Months\nEnded December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Gross premiums written $ 122,635 $ 136,591 $ 516,334 $ 565,845 Net premiums written $ 105,832 $ 113,707 $ 450,180 $ 470,940 Net premiums earned $ 109,216 $ 109,472 $ 438,034 $ 468,465 Net investment income 11,705 8,880 39,323 33,983 Net realized investment gains 2,426 30,778 1,576 21,721 Other income 1,138 742 6,582 10,345 Total revenues 124,485 149,872 485,515 534,514 Net losses and loss adjustment expenses 66,556 48,946 269,212 264,003 Acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses 48,723 47,889 183,733 196,650 Corporate and other operating expenses 14,669 4,274 25,714 17,338 Interest expense 4,841 2,228 16,906 8,905 Income (loss) before income taxes (10,304 ) 46,535 (10,050 ) 47,618 Income tax expense (benefit) 12,694 8,162 (499 ) (2,250 ) Net income (loss) $ (22,998 ) $ 38,373 $ (9,551 ) $ 49,868 Weighted average shares outstanding–basic 17,240 17,264 17,309 17,247 Weighted average shares outstanding–diluted 17,240 17,597 17,309 17,547 Net income (loss) per share – basic $ (1.33 ) $ 2.22 ($ 0.55 ) $ 2.89 Net income (loss) per share – diluted (1) $ (1.33 ) $ 2.18 ($ 0.55 ) $ 2.84 Combined ratio analysis: (2) Loss ratio 60.9 % 44.7 % 61.5 % 56.4 % Expense ratio 44.6 % 43.7 % 41.9 % 42.0 % Combined ratio 105.5 % 88.4 % 103.4 % 98.4 % (1) For the three months and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share since there was a net loss for the period.\n(2) The loss ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio are GAAP financial measures that are generally viewed in the insurance industry as indicators of underwriting profitability.
