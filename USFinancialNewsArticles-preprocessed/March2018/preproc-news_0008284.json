So far, the investigation has charged individuals and businesses with interference, saying they sought to undermine Trump’s rival, Hillary Clinton . \nU.S. intelligence agencies have unanimously agreed that Moscow interfered in the 2016 presidential election, something Russia has frequently denied. \n— CNBC’s Holly Ellyatt contributed to this report.
