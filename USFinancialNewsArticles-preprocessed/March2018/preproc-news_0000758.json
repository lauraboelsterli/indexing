BMW was up 7.5 percent. Mercedes-Benz USA reported 1 percent rise.\nGerman monthly vehicle sales expected on Friday.\nFitch said a German court ruling that cities can impose restrictions on diesel vehicles“sets stage for diesel car bans”.\nAlso, how Geely’s Li Shufu spent months stealthily building a $9 billion stake in Daimler.\nSeparately, Volkswagen’s lawyers said in a submission to a German court reviewed by Reuters that the company’s bosses missed warning signs ahead of its diesel emissions scandal, but did not break market rules by delaying the disclosure of its problems.\nDEUTSCHE BANK Postbank had a good start to the year 2018, its chief Frank Strauss told Handelsblatt.
