So the fact that we’ve got anything at all, which does swing the pendulum back to softer Brexit, is good for sterling.”\nThe European Union is due to publish guidelines this week, following on from a speech on Friday in which May urged the bloc to be flexible in negotiating their future relationship.\nHer comments had disappointed markets hoping for a sign that a transition deal would be clinched in the coming weeks.\nAnalysts say Brexit risk remains the dominant factor for the currency. That drove it to its weakest level against the euro since November on Friday.\nStill, speculators added to their net long positions on the pound last week, data showed on Friday, signalling they are still betting it will rise.\nThe Bank of England has signalled that it could soon start raising interest rates because of relatively strong economic performance — to which a survey covering Britain’s dominant services sector will give more clues — and inflationary pressures.\nBut it has made it clear that rate hikes are dependent on progress in Brexit talks.\n“We (have) turned neutral on sterling in the short term due to renewed political pressure on Theresa May, a rates market that was near fully agreed with our Bank of England view and an FX market that was considerably long sterling,” wrote Nomura currency strategist Jordan Rochester in a note to clients.\n“But sterling’s underperformance (will) only go so far in our view,” he added.
