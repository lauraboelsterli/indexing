    "text": "SANTA MONICA, Calif., March 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BoxScore Brands, Inc. , (OTCQB:BOXS), a consumer products and technology company that develops, distributes, and retails specialty foods across North America announced that FINRA has approved a change of the company’s stock symbol. Effective today, the company’s common stock will trade under the symbol “BOXS” (OTCQB:BOXS). The previous trading symbol was “UVND” (OTCQB:UVND).\n“On behalf of the company and its shareholders, I’d like to thank FINRA for its assistance with our company’s symbol change. As part of our recent rebranding efforts, I am pleased to move forward with a new stock ticker, which is reflective of the company’s new name,” stated David Graber, CEO of BoxScore™ Brands, Inc. “We continue to work diligently to leverage our relationship with U.S. professional sports leagues under existing licensing agreements and very excited about sharing our progress with investors in the coming months,” added Graber.\nIn addition to the stock ticker change, the Company has also been assigned a new CUSIP number. Effective March 1, 2018, the Company's CUSIP number will be #10319B100 for its common stock. A CUSIP number identifies most securities, including stocks of all registered U.S. and Canadian companies, and facilitates the clearing and settlement process of securities.\nShareholders who currently hold their shares in brokerage accounts or “street name” are not required to take any further action as a result of the Company’s symbol change or new CUSIP number, unless otherwise instructed by your broker.\nShareholders in physical possession of their stock certificates are not required to take any action unless they would like new certificates issued to them in order to reflect the name and CUSIP changes. Obtaining a new certificate is optional and not mandatory.
