    "text": "NEW YORK, Sutherland Asset Management Corporation (\"Sutherland\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: SLD) today reported financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter Highlights:\nNet income of $12.7 million, or $0.38 per share of common stock Core earnings of $12.4 million, or $0.37 per share of common stock Adjusted net book value of $16.69 per share of common stock as of December 31, 2017 Originated $216.5 million of small balance commercial (\"SBC\") loans Originated $38.3 million of loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the \"SBA\") under its Section 7(a) loan program Originated $458.7 million of residential mortgage loans Acquired $121.6 million of SBC loans\nHighlights Subsequent to Quarter End:\nIssued $40.0 million in aggregate principal of 7.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2022 with a yield to par call date of 6.50% Declared First Quarter 2018 dividend of $0.37 per share of common stock and operating partnership unit (\"OP unit\"). Approved $20.0 million share repurchase program\nA summary of Sutherland's operating results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 is presented below. Sutherland reported U.S. GAAP net income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 of $12.7 million, or $0.38 per share of common stock, and Core Earnings (a non-GAAP financial measure) of $12.4 million, or $0.37 per share of common stock.\n\"With over $1.0 billion in capital deployed during 2017 through new loan originations, including $130 million in our growing SBA loan business, the Company significantly outperformed expectations in its first full year as a publicly traded company\", stated Thomas Capasse, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"In the fourth quarter we grew quarterly per share earnings 3% from the third quarter as we leveraged our multiple platforms to originate loans. We also aligned our balance sheet during the year with successful non-recourse debt offerings and multiple securitizations. As we move into 2018 we are focused on achieving our strategic objective to expand our platform and create additional value for our shareholders.\"\nFor the first quarter 2018 the Company declared a dividend of $0.37 per share of common stock and operating partnership unit. This dividend is payable on April 30, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 30, 2018.\nCommon Dividends\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.37 per share of common stock and OP unit in its operating partnership subsidiary for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 to common stockholders and OP unit holders of record as of December 31, 2017. The dividend was paid on January 31, 2018.\nApproval of Stock Repurchase Program\nOn March 6, 2018, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing, but not obligating, the repurchase of up to $20.0 million of the Company's common stock from time to time. The Company expects to acquire shares through open market or privately negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of repurchase transactions will be determined by the Company's management based on its evaluation of market conditions, share price, legal requirements and other factors. Repurchases are expected to be made from available cash on hand.\nThe Company issued a full detailed presentation of its fourth quarter 2017 results, which can be viewed in the investor relations section at www.sutherlandam.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance U.S. GAAP, this press release includes Core Earnings which is a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure. The Company defines Core Earnings as net income adjusted for unrealized or realized gains (losses) related to certain mortgage backed securities, unrealized gains (losses) related to residential mortgage servicing rights, and one-time non-recurring gains or losses, such as gains or losses on discontinued operations, bargain purchase gains or merger related expenses.\nThe Company believes that providing investors with this non-U.S. GAAP financial information, in addition to the related U.S. GAAP measures, gives investors greater transparency into the information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. However, because Core Earnings is an incomplete measure of the Company's financial performance and involves differences from net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, it should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, the Company's net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP as a measure of the Company's financial performance. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of Core Earnings may not be comparable to other similarly-titled measures of other companies.\nThe following table reconciles net income computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP to Core Earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2017:\n(In Thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nNet Income\n$\n12,730\nReconciling items:\nUnrealized loss on mortgage-backed securities\n24\nUnrealized loss on mortgage servicing rights\n47\nTotal reconciling items\n$\n71\nCore earnings before income taxes\n$\n12,801\nIncome tax adjustments\n(359)\nCore earnings\n$\n12,442\nWebcast and Earnings Conference Call\nManagement will host a webcast and conference call on Thursday, March 15, 2018 at 8:30 am ET to provide a general business update and discuss the financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.
