    "text": "BOSTON, March 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Nutter announced today that Jason Cabral has joined the firm as a partner in the Corporate and Transactions Department and member of the firm's Banking and Financial Services group. Cabral's practice focuses on providing corporate and bank regulatory advice to U.S. and non-U.S. financial institutions regarding the application of federal and state banking laws and regulations to their investments, activities and mergers and acquisitions.\n\"Jason brings significant experience with some of the nation's largest and most diversified financial institutions,\" said Deborah J. Manus, the firm's Managing Partner. \"His expertise complements our regional and community bank practice, and we are delighted to welcome him to Nutter.\"\nCabral provides legal advice to clients in connection with mergers and acquisitions, fintech investments, merchant banking investments and activities, controlling and non-controlling investments by and in banking companies, and certain private investment fund-related matters under federal and state banking laws and regulations. Clients frequently engage him for counsel on the implications of various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, including the Section 165 enhanced prudential standards and the Volcker Rule, navigating the corrective actions necessary for U.S. and non-U.S. bank holding companies to maintain financial holding company status under the Bank Holding Company Act, and developing internal systems and policies and procedures designed to facilitate their compliance with Federal Reserve regulatory reporting obligations. In addition, Cabral regularly advises U.S. and non-U.S. clients in connection with their applications and notices to the Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC, and New York State Department of Financial Services, as well as the potential impact of regulatory enforcement matters and investigations on their worldwide operations.\nNutter's hiring of Cabral follows the arrival late last year of Thomas J. Curry, who served as U.S. Comptroller of the Currency until May 2017. Nutter's Banking and Financial Services practice group serves numerous bank, financial institution, and fintech clients throughout the United States, Europe, and Canada. Chambers USA, the prominent legal directory, has named Nutter as having one of the top banking and financial services practices in the nation. Nutter's regional and community banking practice is a market leader in New England, representing approximately 100 banks and other financial institutions in corporate and regulatory matters in the past few years. The firm ranks among the top 20 law firms nationally in merger and acquisition work for banks, according to the M&A annual survey published by the American Banker.\nPrior to joining Nutter, Cabral was Special Counsel in the Financial Services group at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP in New York, where he counseled leading U.S. and non-U.S. banks and financial services companies, fintech companies, and private equity firms for more than 10 years.\nCabral earned his J.D., summa cum laude, from Quinnipiac University School of Law and his B.S., magna cum laude, from Ohio University.\nAbout Nutter\nNutter is a Boston-based law firm that provides legal counsel to industry-leading companies, early stage entrepreneurs, institutions, foundations, and families, across the country and around the world.
