    "text": "CAIRO, March 8 (Reuters) - Egyptâ€™s core inflation fell to 11.88 percent year-on-year in February from 14.35 percent in January, the central bank said on Thursday.\nInflation jumped after Egypt devalued its currency in November 2016. It reached a record high in July on the back of energy subsidy cuts but has gradually eased since then.
