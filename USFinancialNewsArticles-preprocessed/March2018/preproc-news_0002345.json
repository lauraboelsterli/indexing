    "text": "31 COMMENTS One risk for the political success of the GOP tax reform is that some businesses will manipulate a large new deduction that could reduce federal revenue and discredit the project. An early warning is a carve-out that benefits some farmers, a clunker that ought to be corrected. \nThe new tax law allows a larger deduction for farmers selling to farm cooperatives versus other operators. The practical effect is a tax advantage for selling to cooperatives, which has no economic rationale. Some farmers could use the loophole to zero out their taxable income.\nThe tax bill is a plus for simplification overall, both on the individual and corporate side. But the farm co-op loophole exploits an exception that created a large deduction for businesses organized as “pass-throughs.” The new section allows filers to deduct 20% of qualified business income. But some filers can deduct 20% of qualified co-op dividends, which is broader. The ostensible point was to preserve preferences for co-ops in the old code.\nIndividuals and pass-throughs used to pay the same tax rate, but Republicans decided to separate the individual rate from the pass-through rate in their reform. Individuals who earn wages at a corporation get no such deduction and did not receive commensurate relief in top marginal tax rates. \nThe inevitable problem is defining what qualifies for the new pass-through deduction, and the cautionary tale is Kansas. Former Governor Sam Brownback’s tax plan lowered the rate on pass throughs to zero, and soon every resident of Topeka wanted to be a walking small business. \nThe notorious example is University of Kansas sports coaches who according to press reports eluded the state’s income tax by earning income through an LLC. State revenues suffered, and the left claims this is proof that cutting taxes can’t increase revenues through economic growth, though the Kansas problem was in the details.\nThe co-op provision’s authors, Senators John Hoeven and John Thune of North and South Dakota, respectively, have said the dispensation should be fixed, though the question is how. Scott Greenberg of the Tax Foundation laid out some possible fixes, and the best route would be to dump the separate co-op deduction altogether.\nBut Democrats are invested in the failure of Republican tax reform and won’t be eager to lend votes to correct the problem. Lawyers and accountants are also working to devise new strategies for tax arbitrage, and the farm cooperative issue may be one of several that lawmakers need to fix. \nThe best legislative option would be reconciliation, the Senate procedure that allows the GOP to pass a bill with 51 votes. Yet invoking reconciliation requires a new House-Senate budget resolution, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that he may not have the votes to pass a budget. Count that as one consequence of the GOP losing the Senate special election in Alabama and now wielding a thin 51-49 majority. \nOne way or another Republicans have to make technical corrections to the tax bill, and lawmakers could address this issue in the finer details of the pending budget bill. The party rightly argued throughout the reform debate that changes in tax rates can unlock new dollars for the Treasury. Provisions that erode the tax base will damage this intellectual cause and the GOP’s political prospects.",
