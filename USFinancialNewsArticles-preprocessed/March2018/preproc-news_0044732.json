    "text": "0 COMMENTS The Riviera Set By Mary S. Lovell (2017)\n1. Long before Las Vegas sold itself as a modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah, the French Riviera was celebrated as a place of sin and excess. Its reputation—to borrow Somerset Maugham’s description, “a sunny place for shady people’’—was well deserved. During the 1930s an exotic array of mainly English aristocrats passed through the portals of Château de l’Horizon, a white Art Deco villa near Cannes owned by the American investor, actress and royal mistress Maxine Elliott. In Mary Lovell’s hands, the villa’s lively “biography” is unveiled. Sewing-machine heiress Daisy “Wanton” Fellowes, who smoked opium or sniffed cocaine before sex, thought nothing of spending thousands of dollars on a gown to be worn once only. “At the Ritz, fellow diners rose to their feet and some even climbed onto chairs to get a glimpse of her monkey-fur coat,” Ms. Lovell writes. Before her marriage to the Duke of Windsor, Wallis Simpson was a regular in this showcase of upper-class decadence.\nThe Château de l’Horizon near Cannes, France.

Cynthia Noble was born into an opulent and cultivated world of English country houses and stylish salons during the years of supreme national self-confidence that preceded World War I. She didn’t start recording her observations until the mid-1940s, long after her marriage to Gladwyn Jebb, a Yorkshire landowner’s son and future diplomat. In her diaries, not only does she portray the rich cast of characters who presided over Britain’s decline, she describes the wretched state of the nation. “We are in the midst of the coal crisis,” she notes in February 1947, going on to describe one morning’s experience: “I had my bath, turned on the electric kettle, filled my hot-water bottle and then went into the sitting room where, wrapped in two rugs and with the hot water bottle at my feet, I settled down to breakfast in an icy atmosphere.”\nWallis and Edward: Letters 1931-1937 Edited by Michael Bloch (1986)\n3. The British royal family doesn’t enjoy a shining reputation when it comes to preserving its correspondence. So we owe a debt to Suzanne Blum, the Duchess of Windsor’s French lawyer, who asked the British writer Michael Bloch to edit the sometimes excruciatingly intimate correspondence between the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. The Duke—briefly Edward VIII, known as “David” to his family—famously abdicated in 1936 rather than give up Wallis Simpson, the American woman whom he would marry six months later. “My own beloved Wallis I love you more and more and more and please come down to say goodnight to David,” he wrote to her in the fall of 1935, when Mrs. Simpson was still married to her second husband. “I haven’t seen you once today and I can’t take it.” The letters in “Wallis and Edward” offer vivid insight into the so-called royal romance of the century, written by the protagonists themselves.\nSelling Hitler By Robert Harris (1986)\n4. On April Fools’ Day 1983, the distinguished British historian Hugh Trevor-Roper was contacted by an executive of the London Times. The executive told him that the German magazine Stern had discovered the private diaries of Adolf Hitler, to which the Times had bought serial rights. Trevor-Roper, an acknowledged expert regarding the Third Reich, was initially skeptical but agreed to fly to Zurich, where the diaries were kept in a Swiss bank. Thus began a tale of greed, obsession and make-believe that would destroy reputations and ruin lives. Trevor-Roper claimed the diaries to be authentic, but they quickly turned out to be a hoax. “Even the physical act of uttering the word ‘Hitler’ necessitates a grimace,” observes Mr. Harris. “Yet, as much as the thought of another Third Reich sickens most people, it remains to this day a cottage industry of staggering proportions.” The hoaxer, a German painter, was trying to cash in on the public appetite for anything to do with Hitler—and did so for a while. “Selling Hitler” is an absorbing encounter of the absurd kind that should be required reading for anyone concerned with “fake news.”\nKing’s Counsellor: The Diaries of Sir Alan Lascelles Edited by Duff Hart-Davis (2006)\n5. The co urtier with the clipped manner and trimmed moustache who steals every scene in the Netflix series “The Crown” was Sir Alan “Tommy” Lascelles. Tommy, who served as assistant private secretary to the Prince of Wales (later Edward Vlll) and as private secretary to George VI and Elizabeth II, was a self-confessed “confirmed diarist.” His comments on the dreariness of life at Buckingham Palace during and after the Blitz and on the political landscape at the time bring those days to life. He is at his most schoolmasterly—indeed, a scold—about Winston Churchill’s wish for a place on one of the warships taking part in Operation Overlord in June 1944. “Winston knows perfectly well that he oughtn’t to do this, but when he gets these puckish notions, he is just like a naughty child. In this instance, his naughtiness is sheer selfishness, plus vanity. Just to gratify his own love of theatre and adventure, he is ready to jettison all considerations of what is due his Sovereign, his colleagues and the State.” In the end, Churchill agreed to stay in London on D-Day.",
