RVR represents a number of leading California brands sourced from across the state.

Following closing, Mr. Simpkins will be recommended for election as a director of the Company, and Mr. Pilger and the RVR team will be joining CannaRoyalty's rapidly growing California operation.\n\"The RVR and CannaRoyalty teams have already worked closely together for the past year. We are confident that the consolidation of RVR with Alta Supply will position us as a leader in the world's largest regulated cannabis distribution system, in California,\" said Marc Lustig, CEO of CannaRoyalty. \"Our extensive distribution network in California makes us an ideal partner for brands that are looking to grow in California at scale. And a carefully selected portfolio of manufacturing partners also make us a superior partner for dispensaries seeking one-stop access to a full spectrum of top products and brands, in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Today's news is a major milestone on CannaRoyalty's journey to building a global cannabis consumer product platform through consolidation of its existing holdings with some of California's leading operators. We welcome the RVR team to CannaRoyalty and look forward to working more closely together in the coming months and years.\"\nTed Simpkins, CEO of River Distribution added, \"Having built a substantial distribution company within the alcohol space in California, I am highly confident that distribution will become one of the most valuable and integral components of the cannabis value chain as the adult-use market matures over the next several years. CannaRoyalty has been an exceptional partner to RVR and it is clear to me that its growing team has the right mix of talent and assets to enable us to continue to meaningfully grow our already leading network.\"\nRVR – Further Information\nRVR has two licensed facilities in California Licensing: Temporary Cannabis Distribution License (Type 11 – Recreational) Temporary Cannabis Distribution License (Type 11 - Medical) In fiscal 2017, River Distribution generated (1) US$25.4 million in revenue\nRVR – Transaction Details\nBinding term sheet for the acquisition of 100% of the equity of River Distribution and its affiliates Consideration: Base Consideration: 5,000,000 CannaRoyalty common shares (\"CR Shares\") (the \"Base Consideration\"), with 1,650,000 of such shares subject to operational milestones Additional Consideration: 2,000,000 CR Shares, subject to the successful completion by RVR of financial milestones to be agreed on by the parties All consideration will be in CR Shares and issued in installments Expected Closing Date: By the end of Q2 2018.
