    "text": "NEW YORK, March 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nVirtual Crypto Technologies, Inc. f/k/a Emerald Medical Applications Corp. (OTCQB: VRCP), is a Delaware corporation formerly engaged through an Israeli subsidiary in efforts to develop and sell its proprietary, FDA-approved DermaCompare software products designed to facilitate the detection of cancerous moles and skin anomalies using digital technology for the early detection of Melanoma/skin cancer. The Company failed to generate revenues from its DermaCompare operations and at the end of December 2017, the Company reported its intention to form a new operation to diversify its business and commence operations that would generate revenues and profits.\nOn January 19 and January 24, 2018, the Company filed Forms 8-K reporting: (i) the formation of a new Israeli subsidiary, Virtual Crypto Technologies Ltd. (\"Virtual Crypto Israel\"), to develop and market software and hardware products for the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies through ATMs, tablets, PCs and/or mobile devices (the \"VC Products\"); and (ii) entry into a binding term sheet with Chiron Refineries Ltd., a public company listed on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE: CHR) appointing a subsidiary of Chiron as an exclusive distributor of the Company's cryptocurrency Products in the territories of North Cyprus and Turkey, in consideration for the payment of $250,000, $150,000 of the total appointment fee deemed as an advance payment on account of future Product purchases.\nOn February 12, 2018, the Company filed a DEF 14C to change its name to Virtual Crypto Technologies Inc.to better reflect its new operations and further disclosed the appointment of Mr. Alon Dayan as CEO of Virtual Crypto Israel.\nThe Company's business plan is to market this technology, subject to local permission and applicable regulations.to the following industries; Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) production and retro fitting existing ATM machines to allow the purchase and cashing out of such coins, for use of the ATM's at locations such as restaurants, retail stores, casinos, pawn shops, among other high traffic locations that wish to offer customers the ability to buy, sell and trade crypto currencies and provide immediate settlement of the currencies.\nTo that end, Virtual Crypto Israel is developing a proprietary, algorithmic technology that it expects will be able to confirm in real-time the purchase or sale of any crypto currency. At present, such confirmations require as many as 6 independent source confirmations and up to 20 minutes or more to settle a bitcoin trade. However, we reasonably expect that our proprietary algorithm, when fully-developed, should be able to predict with very high accuracy whether the bitcoin trade will be confirmed by at least 6 \"miner\" sources. We further believe that the ability to immediately confirm bitcoin and its equivalent transactions in real-time should be a major competitive breakthrough in making the purchase and sale of crypto currencies user friendly.\nThe Company expects that it will be able to combine this algorithmic technology with the ability to simultaneously search among any number of exchanges to find the lowest cost and fastest execution of each designated coin transaction.\nWhile there are other technologies that do this, we do not believe that they are capable of combining with the algorithm with immediate confirmation of a coin transaction. We further believe that our combined technologies, when fully-developed, should dramatically improve the experience of the average trader of bitcoin and its equivalents, meaning faster execution and lower costs.\nAlon Dayan, CEO of Virtual Crypto Technologies Ltd. commented \"We are extremely excited about the transition of our Company represented by the implementation of the name change procedure. Being a wholly-owned subsidiary of a public company will help us share our technological breakthroughs in making the purchasing and sale of crypto currencies a user-friendly experience.\"\nAbout Virtual Crypto Technologies Inc.\nVirtual Crypto Technologies Inc is an R&D company aim to complete the development and market software and hardware products for the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies through ATMs, tablets, PCs and/or mobile devices (the \"VC Products\"); To that end, its fully owned subsidiary Virtual Crypto Israel is developing a proprietary, algorithmic technology that it expects will be able to confirm in real-time the purchase or sale of any crypto currency.
