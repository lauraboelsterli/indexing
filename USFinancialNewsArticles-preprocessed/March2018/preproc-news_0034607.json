FILE PHOTO: The logo of French cosmetics group L'Oreal is seen in front of the Arc de Triomphe during a public event in Paris, France, October 1, 2017. REUTERS/Charles Platiau ModiFace specializes in augmented reality and artificial intelligence applied to the beauty industry, the statement said. Toronto-based ModiFace employs nearly 70 engineers, researchers and scientists who have submitted more than 200 scientific publications and registered over thirty patents. L’Oreal makes an ever greater slice of sales online and has been rolling out services and items for tech-savvy consumers, such as sensory brushes that tell you how to care for your hair or phone apps for virtual make-up tests. It has also launched programs to collaborate with start-ups in cities such as Paris, London and San Francisco. Reporting by Dominique Vidalon, Editing by Sarah White",
