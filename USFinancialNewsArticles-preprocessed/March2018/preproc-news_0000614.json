(\"Concordia\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: CXRX) (TSX: CXR), an international specialty pharmaceutical company focused on becoming a leader in European specialty, off-patent medicines, today announced its financial and operational results for the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2017. All financial references are in U.S. dollars (USD) unless otherwise noted.\n\"We believe that our accomplishments in 2017, which included the development of DELIVER, our long-term growth strategy, have positioned Concordia to have a promising 2018,\" said Allan Oberman, Chief Executive Officer of Concordia. \"As we make progress towards the potential realignment of our capital structure, our global team remains focussed on leveraging our diverse portfolio of medicines, global sales platform, and product pipeline in order to support our aspirations for long-term growth.\"\nConsolidated Fourth Quarter And Fiscal 2017 Financial and Operational Results\nReported fourth quarter revenue of $150.2 million, compared to $170.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, and $154.6 million for the third quarter of 2017.\nGAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of $431.8 million included impairment charges of $207.7 million. The impairments consisted of a $44.3 million impairment of intellectual property rights within the Concordia North America segment with respect to Nilandron®, as well as $163.4 million of impairments from the Concordia International segment with respect to intellectual property, manufacturing processes and in-process research and development.\nReported fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA 1 of $70.8 million, compared to $80.5 million for the fourth quarter in 2016, and $78.6 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nGenerated cash flows from operating activities of $283.2 million in 2017, compared to $408.3 million in 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's liquidity consisted of $327 million of cash and cash equivalents.\nOn October 20, 2017, Concordia announced its intention to realign its capital structure by commencing a court proceeding under the Canada Business Corporations Act (the \"CBCA\"). The CBCA is a Canadian corporate statute that contains provisions allowing Canadian corporations to restructure certain debt obligations. The CBCA is not a bankruptcy or insolvency statute. Under the CBCA process, Concordia's management continues to lead day-to-day operations and operate its business as usual, while meeting its commitments to employees, suppliers and customers.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Segment Results\nThe Company changed the composition of its reporting segments during the first quarter of 2017. As a result, Concordia has presented prior-period segment information to conform with the current-period presentation by aggregating the 2016 segment information of the Concordia North America segment with the segment information of the 2016 Orphan Drugs segment into a single reporting segment, entitled, 'Concordia North America'.\nConcordia North America segment's fourth quarter 2017 revenue of $36.5 million was consistent with third quarter 2017 revenue of $36.9 million.\nRevenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $5.2 million or 12.4 per cent compared to the corresponding period in 2016. This decrease is attributable to competitive pressures on products such as Donnatal® and Plaquenil® AG.\nConcordia International segment's revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $113.7 million compared to $117.7 million in the third quarter of the year.\nThis decrease is attributable to volume and price declines on key products, including Liothyronine Sodium, and was partially offset by the impact of the sterling strengthening against the U.S. dollar, resulting in $1.6 million of additional translated revenue.\nRevenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $15.0 million or 11.7 per cent compared to the corresponding period in 2016. The main drivers of the decrease were primarily due to ongoing competitive market pressures, and were partially offset by foreign currency translation gains.\nPipeline Update\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company launched two new products into markets that have a current IMS estimated market value of $10 million.\nConcordia also has 17 products that have already been approved or are awaiting approval by regulators. These products, if launched, are expected to compete in markets that have a current IMS estimated market value in excess of $150 million.\nIn addition, the Company currently has 32 products under development that are anticipated to launch in the next three to five years. These products, if launched, are expected to compete in markets that have a current IMS estimated market value in excess of $1.8 billion. Concordia believes that these products include several first-to-market or early-to-market opportunities for difficult-to-make products.\nIn addition, the Company has 15 products identified for potential development that, if launched, are expected to compete in markets that have a current IMS estimated market value in excess of $350 million.\nTherefore, in total, Concordia's current pipeline is comprised of more than 60 products that could compete in markets that have a current IMS estimated market value in excess of $2 billion.\nGoing forward, Concordia intends to continue to evaluate additional opportunities above and beyond the 60 products to further increase the Company's pipeline and portfolio.\nNew Organization Leadership Structure\nThe Company today announced that Graeme Duncan, President of Concordia's International segment, will be leaving the organization effective June 30, 2018.\nThere are no plans to fill this position.\n\"We are grateful to Graeme for the contributions he has made to Concordia, and wish him well in his future endeavors,\" said Allan Oberman, Chief Executive Officer of Concordia. \"In alignment with DELIVER, our long-term growth strategy, we have now fully implemented a unified organization structure consisting of four global functions, supporting four geographic business units. I look forward to working more closely with these leaders and their teams as we focus on accelerating Concordia's growth.\"\nThe following senior leaders will continue to oversee Concordia's four geographic, commercial business units, and will report directly to Mr. Oberman:\nPaul Burden, promoted to Managing Director, UK and Ireland, will continue to oversee Concordia's largest business unit (UK and Ireland). Paul joined Concordia in September 2016 and has served as Vice President, Commercial Business, UK and Ireland since then.\nSimon Tucker, Vice President, Commercial Business will continue to oversee Concordia's Rest of World business unit.\nSanjeeth Pai, President, Concordia North America, will continue to oversee the Company's North American business unit.\nGlenn Kutschera, Vice President and General Manager, Pinnacle Biologics, will continue to oversee the Company's commercial efforts around Photodynamic Therapy by Photofrin® for the treatment of certain types of cancer.\nThese individuals and their teams will be supported by the following global functional leaders and their respective support teams:\nKarl Belk, Senior Vice President, Global Pharmaceutical Operations, will continue to lead Concordia's Global Pharmaceutical Operations, overseeing the Company's Supply Chain, Supplier Relationships, Quality, Regulatory, Technical and Operations divisions.\nSarwar Islam, Concordia's Chief Corporate Development Officer, will continue to lead the Company's efforts in strategy, corporate development, business development, portfolio development and mergers and acquisitions.\nDavid Price, Concordia's Chief Financial Officer, will continue to lead the Company's finance, human resources, and investor and public relations functions.\nFrancesco Tallarico, Concordia's Chief Legal Officer, will continue to lead the Company's legal and compliance efforts.\nThe Company believes this streamlined management structure, where all senior leaders report to the CEO, will ultimately help accelerate the execution of the DELIVER strategy.\nConsolidated Financial Results\nFor the year ended\nDec 31, 2017\nDec 31, 2016\nRevenue\n626,169\n816,159\nGross profit\n435,537\n594,957\nGross profit %\n70%\n73%\nAdjusted gross profit (1)\n435,848\n616,369\nAdjusted gross profit % (1)\n70 %\n76%\nTotal operating expenses\n1,600,485\n1,537,264\nOperating income (loss) from continuing operations\n(1,164,948)\n(942,307)\nIncome tax recovery\n(36,757)\n(34,801)\nNet loss from continuing operations\n(1,590,735)\n(1,314,093)\nLoss per share, from continuing operations\nBasic\n(31.10)\n(25.76)\nDiluted\n(31.10)\n(25.76)\nLoss per share, including discontinued operations\nBasic\n(31.10)\n(25.79)\nDiluted\n(31.10)\n(25.79)\nEBITDA (1)\n(953,613)\n(885,117)\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\n315,410\n468,144\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $190.0 million, or 23 per cent, compared to 2016. This decrease was due to lower sales from both the Concordia North America and Concordia International segments, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements, compared to the corresponding period in 2016.\nRevenues were lower primarily due to lower volumes, mainly as a result of new market entrants on a number of the Company's products. Concordia North America segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $97.9 million or 38 per cent when compared to 2016, mainly as a result of lower volumes on key products, including Plaquenil® AG, Donnatal® and Nilandron®.\nConcordia International segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $92.1 million or 17 per cent primarily due to volume and price declines on key products, including Prednisolone, Liothyronine Sodium and Fusidic Acid.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $159.4 million or 27 per cent, compared to 2016 primarily due to the revenue decreases described above. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 is primarily due to changes in product mix within the Concordia North America and Concordia International segments.\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $63.2 million, or four per cent compared to 2016. Operating expenses were higher primarily due to $62.5 million higher impairment charges recorded during 2017 and $43.6 million higher amortization of intangible assets, partially offset by $22 million lower share-based compensation, $14.2 million lower litigation settlements and $12.9 million lower selling and marketing costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses reflect costs related to salaries and benefits, professional and consulting fees, ongoing public company costs, travel, facility leases and other administrative expenditures. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $5.8 million or 10 per cent compared to 2016. This decrease is a result of the Company's objective to reduce operating costs across the business.\nSelling and marketing expenses reflect costs incurred by the Company for the marketing, promotion and sale of the Company's broad portfolio of products across the Company's segments. Selling and marketing costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $12.9 million or 25 per cent compared to 2016. These costs have decreased primarily due to the termination of the Donnatal® contract sales force in 2016, which has been replaced by a co-promotion agreement with Redhill Biopharma Ltd. Sales and marketing expenses in 2017 within the Concordia North America segment have decreased by $11.6 million, and have decreased by $1.2 million within the Concordia International segment.\nResearch and development expenses reflect costs for clinical trial activities, product development, professional and consulting fees and services associated with the activities of the medical, clinical and scientific affairs, quality assurance costs, regulatory compliance and drug safety costs (pharmacovigilance) of the Company. Research and development costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $9.2 million or 23 per cent compared to 2016. This decrease is due to fewer ongoing clinical programs in 2017 compared with 2016, including the cancellation of the Company's cholangiocarcinoma trial in December 2016, and the Company moving certain external service provider activities previously incurred by the Concordia North America segment to the Company's integrated operations in Mumbai, India.\nThe current income tax expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $18.4 million compared to 2016. Income taxes were lower primarily due to the impact of lower foreign exchange translation of the income tax expense from the Concordia International segment as well as lower taxable income compared to 2016.\nThe net loss from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1,590.7 million. Significant components comprising the net loss in 2017 are impairment charges of $1,194.8 million and the deduction of other significant cash and non-cash expenses which include, but are not limited to, amortization expense and interest and accretion expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $152.7 million or 33 per cent compared to 2016. The decline is primarily due to lower sales and gross margins from both the Concordia North America and Concordia International segments, as well as unfavourable foreign exchange rate movements impacting translated results during 2017. Adjusted EBITDA by segment for the 12-month period ended December 31, 2017 was $99.3 million from Concordia North America and $236.7 million from Concordia International. In addition, during the 12-month period ended December 31, 2017 the Company incurred $20.7 million of Corporate costs related to the Corporate Head Office.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $327 million and 51,282,901 common shares issued and outstanding.\nConference Call Notification\nThe Company will hold a conference call on Thursday, March 8, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. ET, hosted by senior management.\nCONFERENCE CALL DETAILS\nDATE:\nThursday, March 8, 2018\nTIME:\n8:30 a.m. ET\nDIAL-IN NUMBER:\n(647) 427-7450 or (888) 231-8191\nTAPED REPLAY:\n(416) 849-0833 or (855) 859-2056\nREFERENCE NUMBER:\n9289998\nThis call is being webcast and can be accessed by going to:\nhttp://event.on24.com/r.htm?e=1602683&s=1&k=4B1F2F5D6D72A7BEA92E8C9BB0354437\nAn archived replay of the webcast will be available by clicking the link above.\nAbout Concordia\nConcordia is an international specialty pharmaceutical company with a diversified portfolio of more than 200 patented and off-patent products, and sales in more than 90 countries. Going forward, the Company is focused on becoming a leader in European specialty, off-patent medicines.\nConcordia operates out of facilities in Oakville, Ontario and, through its subsidiaries, operates out of facilities in Bridgetown, Barbados; London, England and Mumbai, India.\nNon-IFRS Measures\nThis press release makes reference to certain measures that are not recognized measures under International Financial Reporting Standards (\" IFRS \"). These non-IFRS measures are not recognized measures under IFRS and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS, and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. When used, these measures are defined in such terms as to allow the reconciliation to the closest IFRS measure. These measures are provided as additional information to complement those IFRS measures by providing further understanding of the Company's results of operations from management's perspective. Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation nor as a substitute to the Company's financial information reported under IFRS. Management uses non-IFRS measures such as EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted gross profit to provide investors with supplemental information of the Company's operating performance and thus highlight trends in the Company's core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Management believes that securities analysts, investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures in the evaluation of issuers. Management also uses non-IFRS measures in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period, prepare annual operating budgets, to assess its ability to meet future debt service requirements, in making capital expenditures, and to consider the business's working capital requirements. Readers are cautioned that the non-IFRS measures contained herein may not be appropriate for any other purpose.\nDuring the third quarter of 2017, the Company amended its definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income to adjust for costs associated with management retention costs, included within acquisition, restructuring and other costs. Management believes that these costs should be adjusted to provide analysts, investors and other interested parties with results reflecting the core business. This amendment had no material impact on previously issued Non-IFRS measures.\nAdjusted Gross Profit\nAs used herein, adjusted gross profit is defined as gross profit adjusted for non-cash fair value increases to the cost of acquired inventory from a business combination. Under IFRS, acquired inventory is required to be written-up to fair value at the date of acquisition. As this inventory is sold the fair value adjustment represents a non-cash cost of sale amount that has been excluded in adjusted gross profit in order to normalize gross profit for this non-cash component.\nQuarter ended\nYear ended\nFor the periods ended (in $000's)\nDec 31,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2016\nDec 31,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2016\nGross profit per financial statements\n100,200\n120,464\n435,537\n594,957\nAdd back: Fair value adjustment to acquired inventory\n—\n394\n311\n21,412\nAdjusted Gross profit\n100,200\n120,858\n435,848\n616,369\nEBITDA\nEBITDA is defined as net loss from continuing operations adjusted for net interest and accretion expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. Management uses EBITDA to assess the Company's operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for certain charges including costs associated with acquisitions, restructuring initiatives, and other costs (which includes onerous contract costs and direct costs associated with contractual terminations), management retention costs, initial exchange listing expenses on the NASDAQ, non-operating gains / losses, integration costs, legal settlements (net of insurance recoveries) and related legal costs, non-cash items such as unrealized gains / losses on derivative instruments, share based compensation, fair value changes including purchase consideration and derivative financial instruments, asset impairments, fair value increases to inventory arising from purchased inventory from a business combination, gains / losses from the sale of assets and unrealized gains / losses related to foreign exchange. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, among other non-IFRS financial measures, as the key metric in assessing business performance when comparing actual results to budgets and forecasts. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance and cash flow, and provides useful information to investors because it highlights trends in the underlying business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS measures.\nThe table below sets forth the reconciliation of net loss from continuing operations to EBITDA and to adjusted EBITDA for the three and 12-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nQuarter ended\nYear ended\nFor periods ended\nDec 31,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2016\nDec 31,\n2017\nDec 31,\n2016\nNet loss from continuing operations\n(431,773)\n(663,761)\n(1,590,735)\n(1,314,093)\nInterest and accretion\n224,091\n91,742\n506,794\n300,690\nInterest income\n(5,127)\n(16,628)\n(61,302)\n(21,671)\nIncome taxes\n(8,954)\n(23,010)\n(36,757)\n(34,801)\nDepreciation\n475\n512\n1,962\n1,939\nAmortization of intangible assets\n51,162\n41,148\n226,425\n182,819\nEBITDA\n(170,126)\n(569,997)\n(953,613)\n(885,117)\nImpairments\n207,662\n562,105\n1,194,765\n1,132,243\nFair value adjustment to acquired inventory\n—\n394\n311\n21,412\nAcquisition related, restructuring and other\n21,129\n20,309\n46,778\n35,968\nShare-based compensation\n285\n3,438\n8,711\n30,753\nFair value changes of purchase consideration and derivatives\n41,983\n(20,599)\n110,986\n(6,309)\nForeign exchange (gain) loss\n881\n1,403\n1,551\n(3,626)\nUnrealized foreign exchange (gain) loss\n(9,848)\n82,672\n(72,891)\n128,574\nLegal settlements and related legal costs\n—\n783\n—\n14,246\nGain on debt settlement\n(21,188)\n—\n(21,188)\n—\nAdjusted EBITDA\n70,778\n80,508\n315,410\n468,144\nNotice Regarding Trademarks\nThis press release includes trademarks that are protected under applicable intellectual property laws and are the property of Concordia or its affiliates or its licensors.

It is expected that there will be differences between actual and forecasted results, and the differences may be material, including due to the occurrence of unforeseen events occurring subsequent to the preparation of the FOFI. The inclusion of the FOFI in the earnings disclosure should not be regarded as an indication that Concordia considers the FOFI to be a reliable prediction of future events, and the FOFI should not be relied upon as such.\nRisks and other factors related to FOFI include those risks and other factors referenced in this press release as well as in Concordia's filings with the Canadian Securities
