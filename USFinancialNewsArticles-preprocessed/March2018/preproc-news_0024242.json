    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., March 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ConversionPoint Technologies Inc., a leading e-Commerce technology group, has appointed Raghu Kilambi as its new Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.\n“Raghu’s financial expertise and record of success made him the ideal choice as our new CFO,” commented Robert Tallack, CEO of ConversionPoint Technologies. “As we continue to build our e-Commerce technology ecosystem, Raghu’s talent for partnering across all levels of an organization will help facilitate our growth and development, including future strategic investments and acquisitions.”\nRaghu Kilambi is an experienced investor and entrepreneur with twenty-five years of global business experience in public and private investments, building businesses and creating shareholder value. He has raised over $1 billion of equity and debt capital for private and public companies. Raghu’s experience includes operational management, corporate finance, public offerings, strategic acquisitions and investments, international business development, merchant banking and corporate restructuring in sectors including technology, telecom and mobile.\nPreviously, Raghu was the Co-Founder, CFO and Chief Strategy Officer of a leading VC-backed ASP that grew from startup to $140 million in annual revenues and a peak Nasdaq National market capitalization of over US$2 billion. He has also been an investor in portfolio companies that were eventually acquired by Yahoo, eBay and CGI. He earned a Bachelor of Commerce and a Graduate Diploma in Public Accounting from McGill University, and is qualified as a chartered accountant.\n“Management’s vision for simplifying e-Commerce and their commitment to constant innovation attracted me to ConversionPoint,” said Kilambi. “I see the company’s unique offerings and capabilities playing a major role in the e-Commerce success of many global brands, many who are already very happy customers.”\nKilambi succeeds Jack Thomsen, who will continue as treasurer of ConversionPoint and COO of its consumer direct marketing unit, Branded Response. “Special recognition is due to Jack who has played a pivotal role in the formation of ConversionPoint, and setting us a solid course both financially and operationally,” said Tallack. “Given the continued phenomenal growth of Branded Response, his full focus on its operations will much be needed.”\nAbout ConversionPoint Technologies\nConversionPoint Technologies, Inc. is a group of e-Commerce technology companies that are changing how brands, advertisers and agencies connect with, acquire and retain customers.
