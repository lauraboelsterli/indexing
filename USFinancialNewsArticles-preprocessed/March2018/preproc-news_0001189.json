    "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China will take measures to safeguard its interests if U.S. trade measures hurt Chinese interests, the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) said in a statement on Friday.\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that he would impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum to protect U.S.-based producers.\n“China hopes the U.S. respects the multilateral trade system and maintains a normal trading order with the rest of the world,” Wang Hejun, head of MOFCOM’s Trade Remedy and Investigation Bureau, said in the statement.\n“Most of the steel and aluminum products that the U.S. imports are middle- or low-end products and that has not damaged the national security of the country,” Wang said.\nReporting by Muyu Xu and Josephine Mason; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
