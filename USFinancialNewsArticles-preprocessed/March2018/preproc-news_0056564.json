    "text": "TIRANA (Reuters) - A big crowd angered by new charges on the main artery linking 7Albania to Kosovo pelted police with stones and set the toll booths on fire on Saturday, television images showed.\nProtesters set toll booths on fire on the Durres-Kukes highway in Kalimash near Kukes, Albania March 31, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer Thousands of residents of the northern town of Kukes had converged on the area to demand the scrapping of the tolls. The government said on Thursday that lower charges would be set for frequent users.\n“This is theft,” an angry protester told reporters.\nPeople protest on the Durres-Kukes highway in Kalimash near Kukes, Albania, March 31, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer “This tax damages all the Albanians in Kukes and Dardania (Kosovo),” opponents said of the fees, ranging from 2.5 euros for a motorcycle to 22.5 euros ($27.72) for heavy trucks.\nSlideshow (3 Images) Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said the violence against property and police would be punished.\n“The violators and those who inspired them should stop thinking they will triumph over the law,” Rama said.\nEarlier this week when the tolls were imposed, Kosovo truckers emblazoned their vehicles with banners saying that, in effect, a new border had been imposed on the road meant to unite Albania and the mainly ethnic Albanian Kosovo.\nKosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj said the tolls were “excessive”.\nWork on the road, which crosses mountainous terrain, is not completely finished and Rama said those who used it should pay.\nOpposition Democratic Party leader Lulzim Basha said taxpayers already paid a road tax.\nReporting By Benet Koleka; Editing by Andrew Bolton\n ",
