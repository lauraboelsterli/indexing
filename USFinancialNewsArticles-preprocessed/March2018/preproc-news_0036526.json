    "text": " 11 AM / a few seconds ago German investor morale plunges on U.S. trade fears Reuters Staff 1 Min Read BERLIN (Reuters) - The mood among German investors deteriorated further in March, a survey showed on Tuesday, reflecting growing uncertainty about the possible damage any U.S. import tariffs could inflict on Europe’s largest economy. The German share price index, DAX board, is seen at the stock exchange   November 20, 2017.   ZEW research institute said its monthly survey showed economic sentiment among investors dropped to 5.1 from 17.8 in the previous month. This compared with the Reuters consensus forecast for a reading of 13.0. A separate gauge measuring investors’ assessment of the economy’s current conditions edged down to 90.7 from 92.3 last month. The Reuters consensus forecast was for a reading of 90.0. Reporting by Michael Nienaber, editing Joseph Nasr",
