    "text": "March 16, 2018 / 2:26 PM / Updated an hour ago France, Germany to deliver euro zone reform roadmap by June: Le Maire Reuters Staff 1 Min Read PARIS, March 16 (Reuters) - Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Friday that France and Germany had agreed to present a roadmap for euro zone reform before next June’s European Union summit. Paris and Berlin had originally hoped to offer a joint vision for deeper integration within the single currency bloc by this month, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s difficulties forming a coalition delayed achieving this. Le Maire also said that France and Germany would renew work on converging their rules for calculating corporate taxes.
