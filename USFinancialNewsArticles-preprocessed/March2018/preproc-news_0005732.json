The Company also announced a targeted action plan, which includes the restructuring of its Americas business to reduce operating costs and realign the organization for greater efficiency. The action plan also addresses business improvement activities in Europe-Africa, which include the continued integration of Westfalia.\n\"Our sales and operating profit grew for the year, but the business was unable to overcome the challenges we faced in the fourth quarter,\" said Mark Zeffiro, President and Chief Executive Officer of Horizon Global. \"We are disappointed that we did not achieve our full-year guidance. Our global team is focused on addressing these challenges and implementing a targeted action plan, which includes specific initiatives to address our organizational needs to become more efficient, better service customers, grow profitably and build long-term shareholder value.\n\"We are pleased regarding our progress with the Westfalia integration and are on track to realize total cumulative synergies of €18 million by the end of 2018, which puts us in position to achieve our total Westfalia synergy target of €25 million to €27 million by the end of 2019. In the fourth quarter, we announced our entry into an agreement to acquire the Brink Group, which is expected to strengthen our global platform, broaden our customer base, and bring new technology to our product offering. With our proven and scalable project management office in Europe, we believe we have the ability to integrate the Brink business and realize €10 million to €12 million of synergies.\"\n2017 Fourth Quarter Segment Highlights\nHorizon Americas. Net sales decreased 5.1 percent, driven by delivery delays as we transitioned to a new distribution facility and inventory management efforts by retail customers. Operating profit increased $2.2 million to $5.2 million, or 5.9 percent of net sales, primarily attributable to approximately $3.8 million of lower expense related to the impairment of certain intangible assets in our business in Brazil during the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted operating profit (1) increased $0.6 million to $6.6 million, or 7.5 percent of net sales.\nHorizon Europe-Africa. Net sales increased 13.1 percent, or 4.7 percent on a constant currency basis (2) , driven by strong growth in the automotive OE channel, both in new and existing programs. Operating loss decreased $6.2 million to a loss of $7.7 million, or 10.6 percent of net sales, attributable, in part, to lower expense related to fourth quarter 2016 amortization of inventory step-up in connection with the Westfalia transaction and fourth quarter 2016 impairment of intangible assets. Adjusted operating loss (1) increased $1.5 million to $4.6 million, or 6.3 percent of net sales.\nHorizon Asia-Pacific. Net sales increased 33.5 percent, or 30.3 percent on a constant currency basis (2) , attributable, in part, to a regional bolt-on acquisition completed in the third quarter of 2017 and increased volumes in the industrial and aftermarket channels. Operating profit increased $3.1 million to $5.5 million, or 15.8 percent of net sales, as a result of higher sales and operational improvements in the region's manufacturing facilities. Adjusted operating profit (1) increased $3.3 million to $5.7 million, or 16.4 percent of net sales.\nTargeted Action Plan\nHorizon Global has launched a business improvement action plan to address performance challenges that impacted the Company in 2017, increase the organization's overall efficiency and profitability, and position the Company for long-term growth.\nThe plan includes the restructuring of the Americas segment, including facility consolidations and workforce reductions, as well as improving manufacturing efficiencies and optimizing its distribution network. Additionally, the Company will continue implementing actions in its Europe-Africa segment related to business integration and improvement, while continuing to deliver its synergy plan.\nSeveral elements of the action plan are already completed or underway including:\nLeadership changes in the Americas; Centralization of price management for the Europe-Africa; and Reducing logistics costs for the Europe-Africa through renegotiated freight and distribution costs.\nAdditional actions include:\nConsolidate two legacy non-manufacturing facilities in the Americas; De-layer and complete integration of the Americas organization; and Increase low-cost country production in Europe-Africa segment to 25%.\nThe Company expects remaining elements of the plan to be enacted this year, with execution occurring over the next several quarters. The action plan elements are expected to deliver an incremental $3.0 to $5.0 million in consolidated cost savings in 2018.\n2018 Full-Year Outlook\nThe Company expects solid performances from each of its segments in 2018, driven by the Company's strong portfolio of brands and market-leading positions in the geographies where the Company does business. The Company's business improvement action plan is expected to drive positive results across its global operations to deliver improved financial performance and increased shareholder value. In light of these expectations, the Company anticipates consolidated organic revenue growth in the range of three to five percent. Consolidated adjusted operating profit and adjusted dilutive earnings per share are both expected to grow faster than revenue on a constant currency basis. Additionally, operating cash flow for the Company is expected to return to normal historical levels during 2018.\nConference Call Details\nHorizon Global will host a conference call regarding fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings on Wednesday, March 1, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

Forward-looking statements contained herein speak only as of the date they are made and give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking words, such as \"may,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"estimate,\" \"project,\" \"forecast,\" \"intend,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"target,\" \"plan\" or other comparable words, or by discussions of strategy that may involve risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results including, but not limited to, risks and uncertainties with respect to: the Company's leverage; liabilities imposed by the Company's debt instruments; market demand; competitive factors; supply constraints; material and energy costs; technology factors; litigation; government and regulatory actions; the Company's accounting policies; future trends; general economic and currency conditions; various conditions specific to the Company's business and industry; the spin-off from TriMas Corporation; risks inherent in the achievement of cost synergies and the timing thereof in connection with the Westfalia acquisition, including whether the acquisition will be accretive; the Company's ability to promptly and effectively integrate Westfalia; the performance and costs of integration of Westfalia; the Company's ability to successfully complete the acquisition of the Brink Group; the Company's ability to successfully implement its targeted action plan, including realizing the expected cost savings within the anticipated time frame or at all; the timing and amount of repurchases of the Company’s common stock, if any; and other risks that are discussed in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K. The risks described herein are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deemed to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations or cash flows. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We do not undertake any obligation to review or confirm analysts' expectations or estimates or to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\n(1) Please refer to \"Company and Business Segment Financial Information” which details certain costs, expenses, other charges, collectively described as ''Special Items,'' that are included in the determination of operating profit under GAAP, but that management would not consider important in evaluating the quality of the Company's operating results as they are not indicative of the Company's core operating results or may obscure trends useful in evaluating the Company's continuing activities. Accordingly, the Company presents adjusted operating profit and adjusted segment operating profit excluding these Special Items to help investors evaluate our operating performance and trends in our business consistent with how management evaluates such performance and trends. Further, the Company presents adjusted operating profit, adjusted segment operating profit and net sales, excluding these Special Items to provide investors with a better understanding of the Company’s view of fourth quarter and full year results as compared to 2017 guidance and prior periods. (2) We evaluate growth in our operations on both an as reported basis and a constant currency basis. The constant currency presentation, which is a non-GAAP measure, excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe providing constant currency information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our growth, consistent with how we evaluate our performance. Constant currency revenue results are calculated by translating current period revenue in local currency using the prior period’s currency conversion rate. This non-GAAP measure has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Our use of this term may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by other issuers due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation and differences due to items subject to interpretation. See Appendix II for reconciliation.
