    "text": "BERLIN, March 7 (Reuters) - Germany’s transatlantic coordinator told a group of newspapers that the European Union should take a common line in responding to proposed U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs.\nAfter visiting Washington, Juergen Hardt - a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats - told the RND group of newspapers that an escalation of the conflict with the United States was not in Europe’s interests and Europe would stick to a “rule-based world order”.\nHe added: “It’s important that the European Union does not let itself become divided.” (Reporting by Michelle Martin Editing by Michael Nienaber)\n ",
