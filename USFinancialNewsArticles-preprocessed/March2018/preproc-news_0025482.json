Soccer Football - Champions League Round of 16 Second Leg - Besiktas vs Bayern Munich - Vodafone Arena, Istanbul, Turkey - March 14, 2018 Bayern Munich's Thomas Mueller in action with Besiktas' Caner Erkin REUTERS/Osman Orsal It was a record 11th straight victory in the competition for coach Jupp Heynckes, who had led Bayern to the title in 2013 before retiring and returning this season. The German side went ahead through Thiago Alcantara in the 18th minute with the Spaniard volleying in a Thomas Mueller cross to kill off any lingering hopes of a miracle recovery by the Turkish team after Bayern had crushed them 5-0 in the first leg in Munich. The Spaniard, however, was taken off with a suspected ankle problem a little later after only recently returning from an injury break. He will undergo medical checks in Munich on Thursday, club officials said. Bayern, who could secure their sixth consecutive Bundesliga title at the weekend, went 2-0 up seconds after the second-half restart when Gokhan Gonul volleyed a Rafinha cross into his own net. “In the second half we were not really in control. It was a bit wild, all over the place. We lost possession too often, made unnecessary fouls,” Bayern’s Mueller told reporters.

Slideshow (10 Images) They did manage to pull a goal back through Vagner Love’s effort in the 58th minute which breathed some brief life into the hosts and the 40,000 home fans. Yet Bayern substitute Sandro Wagner chested in a David Alaba cross with six minutes remaining to make sure of Bayern’s victory. Wagner, who joined Bayern in the January transfer window, has already scored in the Champions League qualifying rounds for Hoffenheim this season as well as in the Europa League. The quarter-final draw will take place on Friday. Reporting by Karolos Grohmann;  ",
