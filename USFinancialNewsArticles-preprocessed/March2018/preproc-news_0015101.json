(Nasdaq:REFR) announced its its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. Management will host a conference call today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss its financial and operating results as well as recent developments.\nWho: Joseph M. Harary, President & CEO, Seth Van Voorhees, CFO Date/Time: Thursday, March 8, 2018 at 4:30PM ET Dial-in Information: 1-412-717-9591 Questions: Email to Questions@SmartGlass.com Replay: Available on Friday, March 9, 2018 for 90 days at www.SmartGlass-IR.com\nKey Comments:\nThe Company’s fee income for 2017 increased by $272,973 (+22%) to $1,509,070 as compared to $1,236,097 for 2016\nA substantial majority of this increase was the result of increase fees earned from licensees focused in automotive, marine, display and architectural industries which was partially offset by slightly lower level of fee income from licensees focused in the aircraft industry (which the Company believes to be temporary).\nExpenses decreased by $1,576,361 (-29%) for 2017 to $3,927,681 from $5,504,042 for 2016.\nA substantial majority of this decrease was the result of cost reduction initiatives undertaken by the Company that resulted in lower payroll, marketing, investor relations, and patent expense, as well as lower bad debt expenses in 2017.\nThe Company’s net loss per common share in 2017 was cut in almost half from the prior year. In 2017 the Company’s net loss was $2,413,859 ($0.10 per common share) as compared to $4,238,410 ($0.18 per common share) in 2016.\nNet cash used in operating activities decreased by $2,534903 (-63%) to $1,470,540 for 2017 from $4,005,443 for 2016.\nIn February 2018, a small group of long-time shareholders of the Company made an interest-free long-term loan of $1.25 million to the Company which is expected to convert into common stock at a price equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock when the loan was made plus warrants exercisable at a premium to such market price.\nThe Company believes that its current cash will fund its operations until at least the fourth quarter of 2019.\nResearch Frontiers is the developer of SPD-Smart light-control technology which allows users to instantly, precisely and uniformly control the shading of glass or plastic, either manually or automatically.
