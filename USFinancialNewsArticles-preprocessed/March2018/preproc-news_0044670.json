REUTERS/Francois Lenoir “The single market cannot be divided up. There is not a choice of which sectors you sign up to. Once you are outside the single market, you’re outside of it entirely,” Macron told a news conference alongside German Chancellor Angela Merkel after a meeting of EU leaders.\nReporting by Richard Lough, Editing by Gabriela Baczynska\n ",
