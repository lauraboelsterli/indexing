The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) seal is pictured on a gate outside the RBI headquarters in Mumbai, India, February 2, 2016. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/Files The RBI also barred the issuance of letters of comfort, but said letters of credit and bank guarantees can be continued to be issued if certain rules are met.
