(Nasdaq:PRGX), a global leader in Recovery Audit and Spend Analytics services, today announced that Doug Halka has been named Vice President and GM - Commercial, responsible for driving new business development and expanding existing client relationships in the Commercial Recovery Audit business. Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Halka served as Managing Director, Operations, for Accenture plc, responsible for growing client relationships across the Southeast region. Before Accenture, Mr. Halka served as Partner for JMS Advisory Group, a firm dedicated to escheat process development and improvement, and prior to that he was Managing Director/Partner for Callaway Partners, which was acquired by Huron Consulting Group Inc. in 2007.

The restricted stock and options will vest in equal one-third increments on each of March 5, 2019, March 5, 2020 and March 5, 2021, subject to Mr. Halka’s continued employment with the Company. The options have an exercise price of $8.15 per share. The PBUs vest and become payable based on revenue from continuing operations and the cumulative adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations that the Company achieves for the two year performance period ending December 31, 2018. The terms of the PBUs are consistent with the terms of the PBUs granted to the Company’s executive officers on March 30, 2017. The restricted stock, options and PBUs also vest in full in the event of a change in control of the Company, provided Mr. Halka remains continuously employed by the Company until such event.\nThe grants were approved by the compensation committee of the Company's board of directors, which committee is comprised solely of independent directors, and were granted as an inducement material to Mr. Halka entering into employment with the Company in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(c)(4).\nAbout PRGX\nPRGX Global, Inc. is a global leader in Recovery Audit and Spend Analytics services.
