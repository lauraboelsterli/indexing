The foreign exchange gain was previously disclosed under comprehensive income with no corresponding tax provision. The restatement does not impact the Company’s revenues, operating expenses, or net operating income.\nSeasonality is reflected in the timing of when foreign currencies are in greater or lower demand. In a normal operating year there is seasonality to the Company's operations with higher revenues generated from March until September and lower revenues from October to February. This coincides with peak tourism seasons in North America when there are generally more travelers entering and leaving the United States and Canada.\nConference Call\nThe Company plans to host a conference call on March 15, 2018 at 8:30 AM (EDT) .
