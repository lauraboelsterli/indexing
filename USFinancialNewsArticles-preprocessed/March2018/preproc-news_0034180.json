    "text": "GUNTERSVILLE, Ala., March 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Kappler, Inc. is bringing a new set-aside option to government contractors with its unique product category: Chemical and biohazard protective apparel plus specialized fabric technology.\nNow certified as a Woman Owned Small Business (WOSB) in the System for Award Management and the SBA's WOSB certification repository, Kappler provides a wide range of chemical and biohazard garments. The company also specializes in custom R&D support for unique fabric applications.\nThe WOSB status allows Kappler to help federal agencies and large companies meet small business goals through the WOSB set-aside program. Kappler offers the added benefit of a Made In The USA pedigree, a huge plus for military and other government work.\n\"We've already done significant government-related work for NASA, the Navy, Lockheed Martin and others,\" said Laura Kappler-Roberts, company president and CEO. \"The WOSB certification is a natural progression for our family-owned business, and will allow us to expand our expertise to a wider base.\"\nKappler-Roberts represents the second generation of leadership for Kappler, a company founded by her father, George Kappler in 1976. A leading innovator in the critical technology around chemical protection, Kappler produces all its garments and provides technology development services from its Guntersville, AL headquarters.\n\"With our location so close to Huntsville and Redstone Arsenal, we believe the WOSB certification creates a natural synergy with so much military and other government work in our area,\" Kappler-Roberts said.\nIn addition to its Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) products, Kappler has extensive experience supporting government projects with specialized R&D solutions. That history includes NASA work for an ammonia-protective hood for International Space Station astronauts, and a ballistic fabric parking garage for the lunar rover. Other development projects range from a deep-dive suit for the U.S. Navy for hydrocarbon fuel protection, to nanoscale fabric development for Aberdeen Proving Grounds.\nFor more details visit kappler.com or contact Kappler at 1-800-600-4019.\nAbout Kappler: Kappler, Inc. is registered to ISO 9001 and is a WOSB operating under NAICS codes 315210, 315220, 315280, 315990, 339113 and 541715, with CAGE Code 0WR15 and DUNS # 180036501.
