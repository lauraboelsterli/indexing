    "text": "0 COMMENTS Gold prices shot up Friday, climbing for the third straight session with the dollar falling and trade tensions between the U.S. and China ratcheting up.\nFront-month gold for March delivery added 1.7% to $1,349.30 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange—its best day since Feb. 14. Prices have stayed between roughly $1,305 and $1,360 this year, swinging based on safe-haven buying, moves in the dollar and worries about higher interest rates.\nMany investors tend to favor gold when they think markets might turn rocky because the metal has historically held its value effectively and has been relatively stable. Recent worries that protectionist trade policies from the U.S. and China might incite a trade war have boosted gold, as some investors worry that higher input costs for manufacturers will eventually slow the global economy.\nThat anxiety as hurt base metals like copper of late, as weaker growth tends to crimp commodity demand.\n”All market moves today are some function of that news. Geopolitical risks have been taken a notch higher, and that’s benefited gold prices,” said Colin Hamilton, managing director of commodities research at Bank of Montreal Capital Markets. “Concerns about future demand for industrial metals come as those tariffs may hurt demand. Base metals are down, but not by as much as ferrous metals, which are getting slammed because of their focus on China,” Mr. Hamilton said.\nChina—the world’s largest consumer of industrial metals—has announced planned tariffs against American goods , saying it is preparing more actions against the Trump administration’s proposed penalties on Chinese exports..\nRecent trade war worries have pushed the dollar lower, making gold and other commodities denominated in the U.S. currency cheaper for overseas buyers. The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of 16 other currencies, was down 0.4% Friday.\nInvestors have also been tracking economic data and central-bank statements because gold struggles to compete with yield-bearing assets like Treasurys when rates rise. The Federal Reserve lifted interest rates Wednesday and signaled two more increases for this year, encouraging some traders who had feared a quicker pace.\nA more hawkish interest-rate policy might normally strengthen the dollar, but while “interest rates have gone up in recent months...the dollar’s gone down and gold’s kind of been caught in the middle,” said Matthew Turner, metals analyst and European economist at Macquarie.\nRising geopolitical jitters would usually see investors move capital into the dollar as a haven currency, but the fact that the risk is this time emanating from the U.S. means that has not happened, Mr. Turner said.\nAmong base metals, front-month copper for March delivery shed 0.9% to $2.9845 a pound. The recent trade worries have helped push prices down to their lowest level since December and down 9% for the year after they hit a nearly four-year high late in 2017.\nWrite to David Hodari at David.Hodari@dowjones.com and Amrith Ramkumar at amrith.ramkumar@wsj.com",
