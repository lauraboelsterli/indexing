    "text": "Justin Faulk got the tiebreaking goal in the second period, and Derek Ryan added a goal and an assist as Carolina Hurricanes defeated the Washington Capitals 4-1 on Friday night in Washington.\nThe Carolina victory ended a five-game Washington winning streak. In addition, the Capitals had won nine of their previous 10 games.\nCarolina remained alive in the fight for the second wild card from the Eastern Conference. A loss or a shootout victory would have ended the postseason hopes of the Hurricanes but they’re still far behind.\nThe Capitals hold a five-point lead over Pittsburgh in the Metropolitan Division and will play at the Penguins on Sunday night.\nWashington already clinched a spot in the playoffs, and both teams now have four games left.\nWashington had problems getting its offense going, and the Hurricanes outshot the Caps, 30-21.\nCarolina goalie Scott Darling (20 saves), who struggled at times this season, made some big stops — including one on a Jakub Vrana breakaway in the third period that would have tied the game.\nWashington goalie Braden Holtby started consecutive games for the first time since earlier in the March and finished with 26 stops.\nThe Caps took a 1-0 lead when Michal Kempny fired a slap shot past Darling 2:35 into the second period. John Carlson earned his 50th assist of the season on that play.\nCarolina tied it just 40 seconds later when Ryan scored on a rebound from Holtby’s right just outside the crease.\nThe Hurricanes then took a 2-1 lead when Faulk got a loose puck, eluded a few Washington defenders and then fired a shot past Holtby from between the circles with 8:17 left in the second period.\nCarolina kept the pressure on in that second period, scoring those two goals and getting 17 shots on net.\nThe Hurricanes sealed the victory with two third-period goals. Sebastian Aho scored with 5:28 left, and Brock McGinn added an empty-netter later.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
