Athletics - IAAF World Indoor Championships 2018 - Arena Birmingham, Birmingham, Britain - March 2, 2018 Qatar's Abdalleleh Haroun reacts after being disqualified from his Men’s 400m heat REUTERS/Phil Noble All four finishers in heat three were ruled to have run out of their lane after another favourite, Qatar’s Abdalelah Haroun, was red carded for false starting. Grenadian Taplin, running in the outside lane and the hot favourite for the event, had thought he had comfortably qualified in 46.37 seconds for the semi-finals later in the day. Jamaica’s Steven Gayle, Latvia’s Austris Karpinskis and Alonzo Russell from the Bahamas were also disqualified. All decisions were subject to appeal.
