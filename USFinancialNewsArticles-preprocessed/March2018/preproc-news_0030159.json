    "text": " 34 p.m. ET Share \nMeeting not part of process leading to expected May summit AFP/Getty Images Former U.S. ambassador to South Korea Kathleen Stephens will meet the North Korean delegation. \nBy Andrew Jeong \nSEOUL — A North Korean official will hold unofficial talks in Finland with a delegation from the U.S. and former South Korean government officials, Seoul’s foreign ministry said, amid a flurry of recent diplomatic activity before an expected U.S.-North Korean summit by the end of May. \nHowever, American officials said the meeting in Finland isn’t part of the process leading up to a planned meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but would be an informal discussion of the sort that have occurred periodically among former officials, academics and experts from the U.S., North Korea and South Korea. \nA South Korean foreign ministry spokeswoman said declined to say when the meeting would take place. She wouldn’t identify attendees except to say that the South Korean delegation would include civilian academics, alongside former government officials. \nSouth Korea’s semiofficial Yonhap news agency reported that Washington’s former ambassador to Seoul, Kathleen Stephens, would attend. Neither Stephens nor the U.S. Embassy in Seoul could be reached immediately for comment. The American officials said that Stephens, who served as the U.S. ambassador in Seoul from 2008 to 2011, wasn’t carrying a message on behalf of the Trump administration or serving as an interlocutor for the State Department.",
