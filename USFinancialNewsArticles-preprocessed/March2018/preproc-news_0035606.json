FILE PHOTO - Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives addresses the Conservative Party Conference, in Manchester Britain, October 1, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay “That we now have to wait until 2020 to assume full control is an undoubted disappointment,” said Davidson, who leads British Prime Minister Theresa May’s party in Scotland. “Having spoken to fishing leaders today, I know they are deeply frustrated with this outcome. “I should make it clear today that I will not support a deal as we leave the EU which, over the long-term, fails to deliver that full control over fish stocks and vessel access,” she said.
