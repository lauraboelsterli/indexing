    "text": "/ south africa Federal Reserve Interest-Rate Decision—Live Analysis \nMost of the Federal Open Market Committee’s policy statement, due out at 2 p.m. EDT, stays the same from one meeting to the next. But the changes that do get made can offer critical clues, subtle or not, about the outlook for policy. \nIn January, officials rewrote the first paragraph (which describes recent economic developments), removed a sentence about hurricane-related disruptions, added the word “further” in several references to planned gradual interest-rate increases, and updated a line about inflation to say that it was expected to “move up this year” rather than “remain somewhat below 2% in the near term.” \nWill Jerome Powell look to overhaul the statement at his first meeting as chairman? Or will he seek to stress continuity with his predecessor, Janet Yellen? Some Fed-watchers think the latter scenario is more likely. \n“Given that this is the first statement of the Powell era, we don’t think the FOMC will want to change the statement in a meaningful way,” JPMorgan Chase economist Michael Feroli said in a note to clients last week.
