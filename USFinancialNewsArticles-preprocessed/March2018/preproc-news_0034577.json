More than 6,000 people were displaced by the storm, called Eliakim, the National Office of Risk and Disaster Management said in a statement late on Sunday. The tropical storm hit the island’s Mananara region, 635 km north-east of Antananarivo, on Saturday night and had a wind speed of 85 km per hour and gusts of 120 km per hour. In January, the island’s disaster management office said Tropical Cyclone Ava killed 51 people. Reporting by Lovasoa Rabary; writing by Clement Uwiringiyimana; editing by Jason Neely",
