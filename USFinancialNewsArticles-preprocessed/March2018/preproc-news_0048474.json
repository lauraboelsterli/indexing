    "text": "MILAN, March 27 (Reuters) - Telecom Italia (TIM) said on Tuesday it had notified Italy’s communications regulator it had formally started the procedure to separate its fixed access network.\nTIM, whose top shareholder is French media company Vivendi , is putting its network assets into a separate company called NetCo, fully controlled by the phone group.\nIn a statement, TIM said NetCo would have its own assets and its own staff and would guarantee full equality of treatment to all operators, through a single access point.\nThe phone incumbent said the creation of NetCo would comply with Italy’s so-called “golden power” regulation, that gives the government special powers over companies of strategic national importance.\nReporting by Giulia Segreti and Stephen Jewkes\n ",
