    "text": "HOUSTON, March 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American Electric Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:AETI), a leading supplier of power delivery solutions for the global energy industry, today announced its fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 financial results.\nAETI announced revenue for the quarter of $12.9 million, up 37% from the $9.4 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2016 and down 3% compared with the third quarter of 2017.\nThe company’s revenue increase in the quarter was driven by strong growth in the oil & gas sector, which saw a revenue increase of 200% versus the fourth quarter of 2016 but a decline of 16% from the third quarter of 2017.\nFor the year, AETI revenues were $47.1M, up 25% from 2016, primarily due to growth in the midstream and downstream oil and gas sectors.\nEBITDA in the quarter (a non-U.S. GAAP measure) improved by $0.5 million to a loss of $0.1 million, up from a loss of $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and up $0.5 million from the $0.6 million loss reported in the third quarter of 2017.\nNet income in the quarter was $2.3 million, up from a $1.8 million loss in the fourth quarter of 2016 and up from $1.1 million loss in the third quarter of 2017. Net income for the quarter was favorably impacted by a one-time, non-cash benefit of $2.8 million resulting from the utilization of fully reserved tax assets to offset tax liabilities related to the Company's non-US subsidiary and joint venture and based on the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nThe company showed a $4.8 million improvement in annual net income to a loss of $2.6 million in 2017, up from a loss of $7.4 million in 2016.\n“As we continue to execute on our growth strategy, results for both the fourth quarter and the year show we’re heading in the right direction,” said Charles Dauber, AETI president and chief executive officer. “Although we continue to face challenging conditions in our core markets, I am proud of advances our company and employees accomplished in 2017.”\nThe company reported quarter ending backlog of $18.9 million, down 20% from the $23.5 reported at the end of the third quarter of 2017, primarily due to delayed project awards in the midstream oil and gas sector.\nConference Call\nAETI will conduct a conference call at 11 a.m. EDT on March 29, 2018 to discuss the results with analysts, investors and other interested parties. Individuals who wish to participate in the conference call should dial 866-519-2796 passcode 753620, in the United States and Canada.
