    "text": "ST. PAUL, Minn., March 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EMC School (EMC), a leading provider of digital and blended language learning solutions, today announced its vice president of K-12 Computer Science Products, Nikki Navta, will speak at the eighth annual SXSW EDU Conference & Festival taking place today through March 8 in Austin, Texas.\nPart of the overall South By Southwest (SXSW) event that brings together innovators from technology, music, entertainment and education sectors, the SXSW EDU Conference & Festival cultivates and empowers a community of engaged stakeholders to advance teaching and learning.\nNavta joined EMC last month as part of its acquisition of Zulama, a company she founded to create innovative digital programs for computer literacy in middle and high school classrooms.\nNavta will participate in the panel discussion “Tales from Edtech Accelerators”, which helps entrepreneurs in the edtech space determine whether participating in an accelerator program is the right decision. Other panelists include Monica Brady-Myerov of Listenwise, Dave Meyers of TeachersConnect and Ami Shah of Peekapak.\n“SXSW is a hub for inspiration and discovery,” said Navta. “I look forward to discussing my own experience and helping other entrepreneurs learn how to best utilize an accelerator program.”\nNavta’s brainchild Zulama offers computer science education solutions that “hook” students by tapping into a topic they love—video games. A comprehensive, turnkey solution, Zulama provides in-depth teacher training to ensure their success teaching game design, programming, 3D art, and digital storytelling.\nZulama modules, courses and certifications are currently available for sale as part of EMC’s computer literacy product line, and will be available through EMC’s engaging and immersive learning environment Passport . The multidisciplinary curriculum for grades 6-12 adheres to national and state standards, including the Computer Science Teachers Association standards, and can be easily incorporated into any existing middle and high school coursework\n“At EMC School, we are just as excited about strengthening our team as we are about expanding our offerings of innovative educational solutions,” said Mick Demakos, division president at EMC. “We are thrilled to have Nikki representing EMC at an event that sets the agenda for the future of education every March.”\nNavta Joins Pennsylvania STEM Ambassadors Program\nNavta was recently named as one of 36 ambassadors in the Pennsylvania Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) Ambassadors Program, a coalition of leaders that aims to shape the future of STEM education in the state. The group’s focus is on advancing policy goals through outreach, education, and advocacy. As a PA STEM Ambassador, Navta will collaborate with educators, legislators and other stakeholders to share best practices and insights for improving STEM education. She will also serve as role model to encourage youth to pursue opportunities for STEM exploration in both formal and informal learning environments.\n“This program is another way for me to work with legislators in Pennsylvania to shape our education policy,” said Navta, who has served the state department of education on two subcommittees, one focusing on computer science, and the other, STEM. “Part of my commitment to computer science is to continue to advocate for equal access for all students.”\nAbout EMC School\nEMC School, a business unit of New Mountain Learning, is a recognized leader in language learning solutions in classrooms throughout the nation.
