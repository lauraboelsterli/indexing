Revenue from the ready-mixed concrete segment increased $152.0 million, or 14.3%, for 2017 compared to the prior year. Aggregate products revenue increased $14.3 million, or 18.8%, for 2017 compared to the prior year.\nFor 2017, net income attributable to U.S. Concrete was $25.5 million compared to $8.9 million for 2016.

In 2017, ready-mixed concrete segment Adjusted EBITDA increased by $28.3 million to $185.8 million compared to the prior year. In 2017, aggregate products segment Adjusted EBITDA increased by $5.4 million to $27.2 million compared to the prior year.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 RESULTS COMPARED TO FOURTH QUARTER 2016 RESULTS\nConsolidated revenue increased 7.1% to $341.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $318.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue from the ready-mixed concrete segment increased $13.4 million, or 4.6%, driven by volume and pricing increases both organically and from acquisitions in 2016 and 2017. The Company's ready-mixed concrete sales volume was 2.3 million cubic yards for the quarter, up 3.3% year-over-year. Ready-mixed concrete average sales price per cubic yard increased $1.71, or 1.3%, to $133.96 compared to $132.25 in the prior year fourth quarter. Ready-mixed concrete material spread per cubic yard increased 1.7% from $65.12 to $66.24.

Aggregate products sales volume was 1.9 million tons, up 41.4% year-over-year. Aggregate products average sales price increased 9.2% to $13.73 per ton.\nFor the 2017 fourth quarter, operating income decreased $24.1 million to an operating loss of $0.3 million including the impact of a non-cash $5.8 million goodwill impairment charge related to our U.S. Virgin Islands operations resulting from the uncertainty associated with the recovery following the hurricanes. The resulting operating margin was (0.1)% compared to 7.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016. On a non-GAAP basis, our consolidated Adjusted Gross Profit decreased $9.4 million to $61.5 million, with an Adjusted Gross Margin of 18.0% compared to 22.2% in the prior year fourth quarter. Operating income and Adjusted Gross Profit were negatively impacted by a $5.0 million increase to our self-insurance reserves year-over-year. Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the reconciliations and other information at the end of this press release.\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses were $33.2 million in the 2017 fourth quarter compared to $28.6 million in the prior year fourth quarter.

Ready-mixed concrete segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased $4.7 million to $41.0 million in the 2017 fourth quarter primarily due to the negative impact of increased self-insurance reserves. Aggregate products Adjusted EBITDA of $8.3 million in the 2017 fourth quarter increased $1.6 million compared to the prior year fourth quarter. Total Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the definitions, reconciliations and other information at the end of this press release.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, net loss attributable to U.S. Concrete was $3.1 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to $15.6 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations was $8.2 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, in the 2017 fourth quarter, compared to $13.4 million, or $0.82 per diluted share in the prior year fourth quarter, including the impact of a normalized tax rate of 40% in both periods. Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations excludes a non-cash derivative loss of $26.4 million during the fourth quarter of 2016 related to the Company's warrants that expired on August 31, 2017. Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations Per Diluted Share are non-GAAP financial measures.

Sandbrook, President, Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman of U.S. Concrete, stated, \"We completed another exciting and opportunistic year, reaching new highs in volumes, revenue and profit driven by solid growth both organically and through acquisitions. For the full year 2017, total revenue of $1.3 billion increased 14.4% from the prior year and Adjusted EBITDA increased 20.3% to $192.3 million. We continue to capitalize on opportunities that leverage our market strength and operational efficiencies as evidenced by our sixth straight year of Adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. We are particularly proud of our performance in light of significant weather headwinds in every quarter of 2017 within our various regions. For the fourth quarter of 2017, our ready-mixed concrete segment achieved year-over-year volume and average sales price growth of 3.3% and 1.3%, respectively. Our leadership position in our markets enabled us to achieve our 27th straight quarter of year-over-year ready-mixed concrete price increases to $133.96 per cubic yard. We also continue to improve average selling prices for our aggregate products, achieving a 9.2% year-over-year increase in the fourth quarter of 2017.\"\nMr. Sandbrook concluded, \"We are very pleased that we continue to drive superior execution of our strategy and achieve high levels of operational excellence. The underlying demand trends in all of our major markets continue to be positive. Overall, the economic fundamentals across our markets are very positive and with the recently passed tax reform and pre-cursor to a potential infrastructure bill, we remain optimistic about the overall economy and construction industry. Our ready-mixed concrete backlog and existing acquisition pipeline continue to provide excellent opportunities for continued growth.\"\nBALANCE SHEET AND LIQUIDITY\nNet cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $10.6 million compared to $23.6 million in the prior year fourth quarter. The Company's Adjusted Free Cash Flow in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.0 million compared to $17.6 million in the prior year fourth quarter. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to the definitions, reconciliations and other information at the end of this press release.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $22.6 million and total debt of $693.3 million, resulting in Net Debt of $670.7 million. Net Debt increased by $297.1 million from December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of our Polaris acquisition in the 2017 fourth quarter. The Company had $206.4 million of unused availability under its revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2017. Net Debt is a non-GAAP financial measure.

We define Total Adjusted EBITDA as our income (loss) from continuing operations, excluding the impact of income tax expense (benefit), depreciation, depletion and amortization, net interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, derivative loss, non-cash change in revaluation of contingent consideration, impairment of goodwill and other assets, hurricane-related losses, quarry dredge costs for specific event, purchase accounting adjustments for inventory, certain foreign currency losses resulting from Polaris acquisition, non-cash stock compensation expense, acquisition-related professional fees, and officer transition expenses. Acquisition-related professional fees consists of fees and expenses for accountants, lawyers and other professionals incurred during the negotiation and closing of strategic acquisitions and does not include fees or expenses associated with post-closing integration of strategic acquisitions. We define Total Adjusted EBITDA Margin as the amount determined by dividing Total Adjusted EBITDA by total revenue. We have included Total Adjusted EBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA Margin herein because they are widely used by investors for valuation and comparing our financial performance with the performance of other building material companies. We also use Total Adjusted EBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA Margin to monitor and compare the financial performance of our operations. Total Adjusted EBITDA does not give effect to the cash we must use to service our debt or pay our income taxes and thus does not reflect the funds actually available for capital expenditures.

We define Adjusted Gross Margin as the amount determined by dividing Adjusted Gross Profit by total revenue. We have included Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin herein because they are widely used by investors for valuing and comparing our financial performance from period to period. We also use Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin to monitor and compare the financial performance of our operations. Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin are not intended to be used as an alternative to any measure of our performance in accordance with GAAP.

We define Adjusted SG&A as selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding the impact of non-cash stock compensation expense, acquisition-related professional fees, hurricane-related losses and officer transition expenses. We define Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of revenue as Adjusted SG&A divided by total revenue. We have included Adjusted SG&A and Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of revenue herein because they are used by investors to compare our SG&A leverage with the performance of other building materials companies. We use Adjusted SG&A and Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of revenue to monitor and compare the financial performance of our operations.

We define Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations as net income (loss) attributable to U.S. Concrete, excluding the impact of net income attributable to non-controlling interest, loss (income) from discontinued operations, net of taxes, income tax expense (benefit), derivative loss, loss on extinguishment of debt, impairment of goodwill and other assets, purchase accounting adjustments for inventory, certain foreign currency losses resulting from our Polaris acquisition, hurricane-related losses, quarry dredge costs for specific event, non-cash stock compensation expense, acquisition-related professional fees, officer transition expenses and non-cash change in revaluation of contingent consideration. We also adjust Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations for a normalized effective income tax rate of 40%. We define Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share as Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations on a diluted per share basis. Acquisition-related professional fees consists of fees and expenses for accountants, lawyers and other professionals incurred during the negotiation and closing of strategic acquisitions and does not include fees or expenses associated with post-closing integration of strategic acquisitions.\nWe have included Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations and Adjusted Net Income from Continuing Operations per Diluted Share herein because they are used by investors for valuation and comparing our financial performance with the performance of other building material companies.
