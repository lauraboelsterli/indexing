    "text": "Across the country‚Äîfrom Helena, Mont. to Elizabeth, N.J. to Florence, S.C.‚Äîmarketers at companies big and small recently looked at their calendars, discovered that International Women‚Äôs Day was coming up on March 8, and had a panic attack. We should do something , right?\nI know this feeling. And I‚Äôll bet you know this feeling, too, whether you want to call it the urge to move fast and break things or the fear of getting caught behind your competitors. This feeling forces companies to take action, sometimes good and sometimes bad.\nAnd perhaps this is how it happened that fast-food behemoth McDonald‚Äôs (MCD) decided to flip its ‚ÄúM‚Äù logo in at least one of its stores‚Äîas of now, it seems to only be the outpost in Lynwood, Calif.‚Äîand all of its digital channels, something the brand confirmed via Quote: s in Business Insider on Wednesday: ‚ÄúIn celebration of women everywhere, and for the first time in our brand history, we flipped our iconic arches for International Women‚Äôs Day in honor of the extraordinary accomplishments of women everywhere and especially in our restaurants.‚Äù\nMy first reaction to this was that it was even better than a Shamrock Shake. Here was a big company taking the very thing marketers think is sacrosanct‚Äîa brand logo, and an iconic one at that‚Äîand changing it for women . On face value, that‚Äôs the happiest meal of all.\nBut then I started reading some of the social media posts about it, and by the time I was done, I was no longer l-l-lovin‚Äô it. Here‚Äôs what some of them said:\nInstead of flipping your sign, how about you increase the wage for women @McDonalds @McDonaldsUK\n‚Äî IceNineCarl üá¨üáß (@IceNineCarl_) March 7, 2018\nBrands, stop exploiting feminism with cute gimmicks. @McDonalds if you want to be perceived as ‚Äúfeminist‚Äù you can start by paying your employees fair wages. https://t.co/KEKWvY0GQN\n‚Äî Jena Friedman (@JenaFriedman) March 8, 2018\nHey @McDonalds , maybe instead of a cheap PR stunt where you make the M a W to ‚Äúsupport‚Äù women, you do something real ‚Äî like paying your workers a living wage. https://t.co/xoOHRvSQdx\n‚Äî Nate Lerner (@NathanLerner) March 7, 2018\nBut what really struck me after reading all these tweets was that this stunt looks good at face value because that‚Äôs all it is: face value. The flipping of a sign is as empty of a gesture as the flipping of a burger. The company wasn‚Äôt doing anything to support its female-identifying employees or customers; it was simply saying it supported them.\nOn the same day I saw this, I happened to also attend a digital marketing conference where I saw WeWork CEO Adam Neumann speaking alongside Seth Besmertnik, co-founder of SEO content platform Conductor‚Äîwhich the former had announced acquiring the day before. Now, as a marketer, I‚Äôm generally skeptical of marketing, but I was taken with the fact that the alignment these two entrepreneurs identified among their companies was in ‚Äúhumanizing marketing.‚Äù\nNeumann in particular spoke of how we‚Äôd gotten away from a world in which we‚Äôre creating tangible value in customer‚Äôs lives, and we have to get back to that. This resonated for me as I‚Äôve written a lot on the topic of empathy in marketing , and why it‚Äôs more important than ever.\nIt also seems relevant in this McDonald‚Äôs situation.\nIn light of this sign switcheroo, ThinkProgress writer Luke Barnes called out the company for its low wages and for allegedly ignoring employee sexual harassment complaints, among other things. I won‚Äôt claim to be an expert on McDonald‚Äôs policies toward the advancement of women. But I will say that while it would have most certainly been harder for the company to address real issues such as these, it would almost certainly have been more meaningful.\nImagine if the sign stunt had come concurrent to real action or policy change‚Äîfor example, a pay parity review system or an anonymous harassment line. The McDonald‚Äôs PR team would have had a field day taking calls from press lauding them for making a major mea culpa. After all, it‚Äôs harder to write bad things about a company that‚Äôs owning up to something.\nBut attaching an action to a press release gets you more than just buzz. It can buy you loyalty. Such a policy would create a better employee experience, and employer branding is customer branding just as customer branding is employer branding.\nSuch an action would make consumers feel better about their purchases. And data from Motista cited in a Harvard Business Review article found that people who feel an emotional connection with the brand bring in 52% more value for the company than the typical ‚Äúhighly satisfied‚Äù customer. At the same conference I attended on Wednesday, Ryan Skinner, an analyst with Forrester, talked about the economic benefits of investing in customer experience. For a big-box retailer, the closest category to fast food he discussed, a one-point increase in customer experience index can result in a revenue differential of $244 million.\nThat‚Äôs real money. We‚Äôre not talking Dollar Menu here. But instead of taking the higher, steeper, and possibly more profitable road, Mickey D‚Äôs simply provided an easy way for the competition to slide in with a sick burn:\nWendy's starts with a W\n‚Äî Wendy's (@Wendys) March 6, 2018\nHey, now there‚Äôs a woman I can relate to: She‚Äôs funny but confident and not afraid to stand up for herself. As quick marketing activations go, that‚Äôs not bad.\nBut even that doesn‚Äôt move the needle on progress for humanity. So let me leave you with a contrarian thought for marketers: Do you really need to move fast and break things? Wouldn‚Äôt it be better to sometimes move slowly‚Äîand thoughtfully‚Äîand fix them?\nMargaret Magnarelli is senior director of marketing at Monster.",
