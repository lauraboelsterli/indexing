(NASDAQ: MOMO) (\"Momo\" or the \"Company\"), a leading mobile social networking platform in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and the full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nNet revenues increased 57% year over year to $386.4 million. Net income attributable to Momo Inc. increased to $97.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $83.8 million in the same period last year. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Momo Inc. (note 1) increased 20% to $110.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $91.5 million in the same period last year. Diluted net income per American Depositary Share (\"ADS\") was $0.47, compared to $0.41 in the same period last year. Non-GAAP diluted net income per ADS (note 1) was $0.53, compared to $0.44 in the same period last year. Monthly Active Users (\"MAU\") [1] were 99.1 million in December 2017, compared to 81.1 million in December 2016\nFull Year 2017 Highlights\nNet revenues increased 138% year over year to $1,318.3 million for the full year of 2017. Net income attributable to Momo Inc. was $318.6 million for the full year of 2017, compared with $145.3 million in 2016. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Momo Inc. (note 1) was $368.2 million for the full year of 2017, compared with $177.0 million in 2016. Diluted net income per ADS was $1.53 for the full year of 2017, compared with $0.71 in 2016. Non-GAAP diluted net income per ADS (note 1) was $1.77 for the full year of 2017, compared with $0.87 in 2016.\n\"We had a good fourth quarter, capping off a remarkable year. I am happy to see the initiatives that we took in prior quarters started to bear early fruits.\" Commented Yan Tang, Chairman and CEO of Momo. \"Net addition in MAU reaccelerated in the quarter with improving user retention and engagement. Such reacceleration shows the effectiveness of our product and content strategy as well as the improvement in the top of the funnel efficiency driven by our new marketing system. In addition, due to the initiatives that we have been taking since the fourth quarter, the content ecosystem around the live streaming service is seeing substantial development as we entered into the new year, providing a solid foundation for us to continue to drive content improvement and business growth for live streaming business going forward.\"\n[1] MAU during a given calendar month is defined as Momo users who accessed the Momo platform through Momo mobile application and utilized any of the functions on the Momo platform for at least one day during the 30-day period counting back from the last day of such calendar month. The active users on Hani, the Company's stand-alone live video application, were not included in the MAU disclosed herein.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nNet revenues\nTotal net revenues were $386.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 57% from $246.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nLive video service revenues continued its momentum and generated revenues of $328.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The rapid growth in live video revenues was contributed by the increase in the quarterly paying users, which was 4.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as, the increase in the average revenues per paying user per quarter.\nValue-added service revenues mainly include membership subscription revenues and virtual gift revenues. The total value-added service revenues were $29.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 54% from $19.1 million during the same period of 2016. The year over year increase was primarily driven by the increase in the number of paying users, and to a lesser extent, the increase in the average revenues per paying user per quarter with the result that we introduced more and more value-added services to our users to enrich communication experience among users. Total paying users of our value-added service were 5.0 million and 3.7 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nMobile marketing revenues were $21.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 11% from $19.7 million during the same period of 2016. The growth in mobile marketing revenues was driven by the increased demand from brand marketers which was partially offset by the decrease of our advertisement inventories in the new version of Momo 8.0.\nMobile games revenues were $6.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 39% from $11.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in game revenues was mainly due to the decrease in the quarterly paying users.\nCost and expenses\nCost and expenses were $293.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 86% from $157.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to: (a) an increase in revenue sharing with the broadcasters related to our live video service and virtual gift recipients; (b) an increase in marketing and promotional expenses to enhance our brand awareness, attract users and promote the live video service; (c) an increase in personnel related costs including share-based compensation expenses as a result of the Company's rapidly expanding talent pool; (d) increased infrastructure related spending, such as short messaging service charges, bandwidth costs and server depreciation costs, driven by more functions introduced on Momo's platform.\nNon-GAAP cost and expenses (note 1) were $280.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 87% from $150.0 million during the same period last year.\nIncome from operations\nIncome from operations was $107.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $88.4 million during the same period last year.\nNon-GAAP income from operations (note 1) was $119.6 million in fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $96.1 million during the same period last year.\nIncome tax expenses\nIncome tax expenses were $19.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, increased from $3.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was mainly because we generated higher profit in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the tax holiday of one of our major profit generating entities changed from 100% exemption to 50% exemption of income tax.\nNet income attributable to Momo Inc.\nNet income attributable to Momo Inc. was $97.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $83.8 million during the same period last year.\nNon-GAAP net income (note 1) attributable to Momo Inc. was $110.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $91.5 million during the same period last year.\nNet income per ADS\nDiluted net income per ADS was $0.47 in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $0.41 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNon-GAAP diluted net income per ADS (note 1) was $0.53 in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $0.44 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCash and cash flow\nAs of December 31, 2017, Momo's cash, cash equivalents and term deposits totaled $1,059.6 million, compared to $651.3 million as of December 31, 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $119.6 million, compared to $107.2 million for the same quarter of 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nNet revenues for the full year of 2017 were $1,318.3 million, an increase of 138% from $553.1 million in 2016, primarily driven by the significant increase in net revenues from live video service, value-added service, mobile marketing business.\nNet income attributable to Momo Inc. was $318.6 million for the full year of 2017, compared to $145.3 million in 2016.\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to Momo Inc. (note 1) was $368.2 million for the full year of 2017, compared to $177.0 million in 2016.\nDiluted net income per ADS was $1.53 for the full year of 2017, compared to $0.71 in 2016.\nNon-GAAP diluted net income per ADS (note 1) was $1.77 for the full year of 2017, compared to $0.87 in 2016.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $427.6 million during the full year of 2017, compared to $218.3 million in 2016.\nBusiness Outlook\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company expects total net revenues to be between $387.0 million and $402.0 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 46% to 52%. These estimates reflect the Company's current and preliminary view, which is subject to change.\nNote 1: Non-GAAP measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), we use various non-GAAP financial measures that are adjusted from the most comparable GAAP results to exclude share-based compensation.\nReconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to our U.S. GAAP financial measures are shown in tables at the end of this earnings release, which provide more details about the non-GAAP financial measures.\nOur non-GAAP financial information is provided as additional information to help investors compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis and to enhance investors' overall understanding of the historical and current financial performance of our continuing operations and our prospects for the future. Our non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to the GAAP results. In addition, our calculation of the non-GAAP financial measures may be different from the calculation used by other companies, and therefore comparability may be limited.\nOur non-GAAP information (including non-GAAP cost and operating expenses, income from operations, net income attributable to Momo Inc., and diluted earnings per ADS) is adjusted from the most comparable GAAP results to exclude share-based compensation. A limitation of using these non-GAAP financial measures is that share-based compensation charge has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our results of operations. We compensate for these limitations by providing reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to our U.S. GAAP measures. Please see the reconciliation tables at the end of this earnings release.\nConference Call\nMomo's management will host an earnings conference call on Wednesday, March 7, 2018 at 8: 00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time (9:00 p.m. Beijing / Hong Kong Time on March 7, 2018).\nDial-in details for the earnings conference call are as follows:\nInternational:\n+65 6713 5090\nU.S. Toll Free:\n+1 866 519 4004\nHong Kong Toll Free:\n800-906601\nMainland China:\n4006-208038\nPasscode:\nMomo\nPlease dial in 15 minutes before the call is scheduled to begin.\nA telephone replay of the call will be available after the conclusion of the conference call through 8:00 a.m. U.S. Eastern Time, March 15, 2018.
