In contrast, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields are set to end February with a rise of around 18 bps - reflecting investor expectations for higher rates.\n“The negative Fed talk has had little impact on bonds or euro area peripherals,” analysts at Societe Generale said in a note.\n“So any surprises in the German and Italian votes this weekend could be amplified by the lack of much adjustment so far.”\nItaly holds a national election this Sunday - the same day that Germany finds out the results of a ballot of Social Democrat party members on a coalition deal with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives.\nGermany auctions 3 billions euros of its 10-year Bund later in the day. The U.S. publishes its GDP numbers for its fourth quarter.\nReporting by Fanny Potkin; graphic by Dhara Ranasinghe; Editing by Jon Boyle\n ",
