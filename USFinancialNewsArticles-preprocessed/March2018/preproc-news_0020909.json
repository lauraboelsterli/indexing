    "text": "SUGAR LAND, Texas, March 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Trecora Resources (NYSE: TREC), a leading provider of high purity specialty hydrocarbons and waxes, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n\"We delivered a solid quarter of financial results highlighted by the continued growth of prime product volume,\" said Simon Upfill-Brown, President and CEO. \"Adjusted EBITDA increased 47.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 as increased profits at SHR drove performance. In addition, AMAK delivered positive results in the quarter as a result of the efforts over the past year to upgrade the facilities and improve production operations.\n\"Although we delivered financially on a company level, Trecora Chemical (TC) results were significantly below expectations. Our new hydrogenation unit continued to struggle to consistently perform at design rates, and therefore custom processing revenues remain below target levels,\" Upfill-Brown continued. \"The market demand for TC's custom processing capabilities and services remains strong with our customers supporting us as we work through the issues. Our full attention is on improving operations and organizational effectiveness.\n\"As a result, we have recently made changes to the organizational structure at TC. We created and filled a new position, Custom Processing Manager, to focus on custom processing operational improvements. We also streamlined management and empowered strong operational leaders with years of experience in custom processing and plant management to take responsibility for control of production. We believe these changes will ensure that TC is best positioned to realize the full benefits of recent capital projects in 2018 and beyond.\n\"As a part of this change, Peter Loggenberg, President of TC, is transitioning to a new, strategic role as Chief Sustainability Officer,\" said Upfill-Brown. \"I would like to thank Peter for his contributions including his role in bringing the B Plant on line and his ongoing efforts to build strong and lasting customer relationships at TC. In his new role Peter will focus on business development and growth projects across all of our businesses.\n\"As reported on February 20, our Advanced Reformer unit at SHR, which was in the final construction and start-up phase, experienced a fire. While there were no injuries, the resulting damage to equipment has delayed the expected commissioning of the unit until third quarter 2018,\" added Upfill-Brown. \"We are working closely with our insurance carrier and expect prompt reimbursement of repair costs above our $1 million deductible minimizing the impact to cash flow. This is a disappointing delay, but I remain confident in the team's ability to safely get the unit up and running and am encouraged by the business prospects of the Advanced Reformer.\n\"In light of recurring operational challenges, we are announcing today additional organizational changes designed to ensure we have the right expertise and oversight in place as we look to leverage our assets including recent capital projects.\" Upfill-Brown continued. \"First, I will be assuming the role of Chief Operating Officer in addition to my current responsibilities as Chief Executive Officer. In addition, Nicholas Carter, currently our Chairman of the Board, will temporarily take on the responsibilities of Executive Chairman and will support me in driving performance through the end of 2018.\n\"Furthermore, we have eliminated the position of Vice President of Manufacturing, providing me direct oversight of our manufacturing processes.\n\"In total, we are confident these organizational changes will ensure the Company is well positioned to leverage our assets and realize the full benefits of recent capital projects in 2018 and beyond.\n\"We have described 2017 as a transition year, and while we experienced some setbacks and delays in certain capital projects, we withstood Hurricane Harvey with minimal damage due to the extraordinary efforts of our entire team. We believe the progress we have made across all facets of our business positions us for long-term growth and improved profitability in 2018,\" concluded Upfill-Brown.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue in the fourth quarter was 66.0 million, compared with $54.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 21.7%. The increase in reported revenue was driven by a 24.3% increase in petrochemical sales volume and a 2.5% increase in the average sales price of petrochemical products compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. The higher average sales price was partially offset by a 14.6% year-over-year increase in the average per-gallon cost of petrochemical feedstock, which is the basis for the formula pricing for about 60% of the Company's petrochemical product sales. Since formula pricing is based upon prior month feedstock averages, sales price increases tend to lag higher feedstock costs resulting in lower profit margins in the period reported.\nGross profit in the fourth quarter was $10.0 million, or 15.1% of total revenues, compared with $7.7 million, or 14.1% of total revenues, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating income for the fourth quarter was $4.8 million, compared with operating income of $2.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet income for the fourth quarter was $14.0 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $0.8 million, or $(0.03) per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $3.0 million, or $0.12 per share 1 . Reported net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 reflected equity in earnings of AMAK of $0.9 million or an estimated $0.03 per diluted share on an after-tax basis along with a tax benefit from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of approximately $10.3 million or an estimated $0.41 per diluted share as compared to equity in losses of AMAK of $3.7 million or an estimated after tax impact of $(0.10) per diluted share in the year-ago period.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $8.5 million, representing a 12.8% margin, compared with Adjusted EBITDA of $5.7 million, representing a 10.6% margin for the same period a year ago.\nSouth Hampton Resources\nPetrochemical volume in the fourth quarter was 22.8 million gallons, compared with 18.4 million gallons in the fourth quarter of 2016. Prime product volume in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 17.1 million gallons, compared with 14.4 million gallons in the fourth quarter of 2016. Byproduct volume increased 0.3% sequentially and 44.8% year-over-year, to 5.7 million gallons. These volumes are sold at lower margins than our prime products; however, fourth quarter 2017 by-product margins were higher compared to third quarter 2017 and fourth quarter of 2016.\nInternational volume represented 22.7% of total petrochemical volume during the quarter, up from 17.3% sequentially and on par with 22.7% from the fourth quarter of 2016.\n1 Based on adjusted net income of $3.0 million and 25.2 million shares outstanding.\nSHR SEGMENT INFORMATION*\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED\nDECEMBER 31,\n2017\n2016\n% Change\nProduct sales\n$56,176\n$44,185\n27%\nProcessing fees\n1,788\n1,997\n(10%)\nNet revenues\n$57,964\n$46,182\n26%\nOperating profit before depreciation and amortization\n10,217\n6,187\n65%\nOperating profit\n8,591\n4,572\n88%\nProfit before taxes\n8,171\n4,387\n86%\nDepreciation and amortization\n1,626\n1,615\n1%\nEBITDA\n10,398\n6,182\n68%\nCapital expenditures\n$ 10,366\n$ 6,136\n69%\n*Dollar amounts in thousands/rounding may apply\nTrecora Chemical\nTC generated revenues of $8.0 million, essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2016.
