    "text": "SARASOTA, Fla., March 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Uniroyal Global Engineered Products, Inc. (OTCQB:UNIR) (or the “Company”) today reported its financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Highlights\n*Net Sales of $98,138,060 decline 2.2% versus $100,377,278 of prior year on tepid U.S automotive sales\n*Gross Margins decline to 18.8% versus 22.8% in prior year due to timing of raw material increases versus selling price adjustments\n*Operating Expenses decline 6.4% versus the prior year\n*Company records Non-recurring tax charges of $2.9 million versus tax benefit of $1.9 million in previous year\n*Diluted Earnings Per Common Share were a loss of $0.17 versus income of $0.24 in the prior year, or a loss of $0.01 and income of $0.14 per share excluding the adjustments in both years\nOverview\nSeveral years ago the Company embarked on a geographic and customer diversification strategy with the acquisition of a major automotive supplier in the UK. This acquisition complemented the Company’s growing penetration in the global automotive industry and diversified our automotive customer base. This strategy lead to significant benefits in 2017 which from a consolidated basis was a very tough year as Net Sales and Operating Income declined from the prior year. Our European operations (54.4% of Net Sales) had a superb year, increasing Net Sales 10.6% versus the prior year, however, this increase virtually offset a very sluggish year in our North American operations where Net Sales declined 14.1% versus the previous year. Automotive sales (67.5% of Net Sales) were the major contributor for both our European and North American operations. In Europe, automotive Net Sales increased 13.2% versus last year due to increased penetration of existing customers and the awarding of new platforms while in North America Net Sales declined sharply as volume from the platforms in which we participate was very sluggish and manufacturers had to curb production levels because of lower demand. We are working to reposition and expand our automotive product lines to gain a greater breadth of penetration into the North American market as well as exploring opportunities for further geographic expansion to bolster our growth.\nWe also experienced significant raw material price increases this year. Selling price increases have been implemented but the timing of the price increases always lags the raw material increases so it led to the Gross Margin contraction we experienced this year versus the previous year. Also, significant short-term operating inefficiencies resulting from newly awarded automotive platforms in Europe negatively impacted on Gross Margins.\nOur continuing strategy to reduce Operating Expenses resulted in an overall reduction in expenses of approximately $950,000 or 6.4%. As a percentage of Net Sales, Operating Expenses were 14.1% this year which was well below the level of 14.8% recorded last year. The reduction in Operating Expenses is a continuing emphasis on our part and we expect more improvement next year.\nIn the fourth quarter of this year we took non-recurring charges to the Tax Provision because of the recently approved Tax Reform Act. The non-recurring charges negatively impacted Diluted Earnings Per Common Share by $0.16.\n“To put a close on Fiscal 2017, it was a very tough year but we were able to adjust to a very trying environment. Fortunately, many of the issues we faced during last year are within our control. While we are confident in our strategic direction, restaging and reformulating product lines while cutting costs will take time. We look forward to marked improvement in 2018 particularly in the second half of the year,” said Howard R. Curd, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nNet Sales\nNet Sales for the fiscal year declined 2.2% to $98,138,060 versus $100,377,278 in the prior year. Excluding currency translations, organic sales would have declined 1.7% from the previous year.\nThe Global Automotive Sector, 67.5% of Net Sales, declined 1.5% as compared to the prior year period. European automotive sales increased 13.2% for the year, virtually offsetting a significant decline in North American automotive sales due to a continued demand for SUV’s and light trucks by US consumers at the expense of traditional cars. The vast majority of the current North American automotive volume for the Company is for passenger cars which is presently experiencing declining sales in the U.S.\nThe remaining sectors (non-automotive transportation, distribution and contract), 32.5% of Net Sales, declined 3.7% versus the prior year as gains in the fourth quarter, due to an improving U.S. economy, were not enough to offset the declines recorded in the first nine months of this year.\nOperating Income\nOperating Income for the year was $4,544,835 (4.6% of Net Sales) compared to $8,046,665 (8.0% of Net Sales) in the prior year. Operating Income was down significantly as operating margins continued to be negatively impacted by the rising raw material costs at the US and European operations and by the production inefficiencies due to platform changes, particularly in Europe. This loss was partially offset by the results of the positive steps taken which sharply reduced Operating Expenses.\n“We have implemented price increases where possible to partially offset raw material increases and we have been making significant improvement in operational efficiencies. The results of last year are totally unacceptable and our team is dedicated to making strong improvement this year,” noted Curd.\nNet Loss/Income Available to Common Shareholders\nThe decline in Operating Income this year versus the prior year, combined with a tax charge of $2.9 million this year versus a tax benefit in the preceding year, resulted in a net loss of $3,102,130 available to Common Shareholders versus net income of $4,499,664 reported last year.\nDiluted Loss Per Common Share was $0.17 versus Income Per Common Share of $0.24 of the previous year. The tax charges recorded in Fiscal 2017 negatively impacted per share results by $0.16 per share as compared to the $0.10 per share positive result of the Fiscal 2016 tax adjustment.\nFor further details, see the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the Company’s Form 10-K filed on March 19, 2018.
