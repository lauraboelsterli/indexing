    "text": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Forces supporting the Syrian government have been mobilizing around eastern Ghoutaâ€™s rebel-held town of Douma since Monday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said on Tuesday.\nDouma, controlled by rebel group Jaish al-Islam, is the last remaining insurgent-held area in eastern Ghouta. Talks between the group and Syrian government ally Russia over a rebel withdrawal have yet to yield a result. The United Nations has said it is highly concerned for 70,000-78,000 people it believes are trapped inside.\nReporting by Ellen Francis and Lisa Barrington; Editing by Peter Graff\n ",
