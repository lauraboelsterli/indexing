    "text": "PETACH TIKVA, Israel, March 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Gadi Lesin, President and CEO of Strauss Group (TASE: STRS) \"Strauss Group continues to present solid results in all key parameters. In the fourth quarter of 2017 sales grew a stellar 10.2% excluding FX translation, and net income rose by 34%. These excellent results were attained, among other things, by implementing strategic moves which enhanced the Group's operational and managerial flexibility whilst focusing on core assets, by increasing our investment in innovation, signing new distribution agreements and expanding our geographical reach. Alongside the strong performance of Strauss Israel, Strauss Coffee and Strauss Water, 2017 was a challenging year for Sabra, our dips and spreads business in North America, which nevertheless succeeded in returning to close to pre-recall selling and market share levels.\"\n2017 highlights ( 1)\nOrganic sales growth, excluding foreign currency effects, was c8%.
