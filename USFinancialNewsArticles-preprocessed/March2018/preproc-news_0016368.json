    "text": "Full Year 2017 Total Revenues of $299.7 million Increased 4.9% Over Prior Year\nHOUSTON, March 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Nobilis Health Corp. (NYSE American: HLTH) (\"Nobilis\" or the \"Company\") today announced financial and operational results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFull Year and Fourth Quarter Highlights\nFull year total revenue of $299.7 million, a 4.9% increase over prior year Full year net income of $3.8 million, compared to prior year net income of $6.4 million; net income impacted by $6.2 million deferred tax asset adjustment Full year Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $41.4 million, an increase of 21.9% over the prior year Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $34.0 million Full year cash from operations of $26.4 million, compared to $1.6 million in the prior year Fourth quarter total revenues of $86.8 million, compared to $101.9 million in the prior year Fourth quarter net income of $3.6 million, compared to $9.4 million in the prior year; net income impacted by $6.2 million deferred tax asset adjustment Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $22.6 million, an increase of 8.9% over the prior year Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $20.8 million\n\"We are pleased to report 2017 year over year growth in revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of 4.9% and 21.9%, respectively,\" said Harry Fleming, Chief Executive Officer of Nobilis Health. \"We made great progress reducing overall costs last year as evidenced by improvements in gross margins, operating income and net income, absent the impact of tax reform. We achieved this despite an estimated loss of $15-$20 million of revenues in the Houston market resulting from Hurricane Harvey. 2017 was a big year for us--we made significant progress on our in-network strategy with the acquisitions of Elite Surgical Affiliates, Hamilton Vein Center, DeRosa Medical and Mountain West Surgery Center. As we enter 2018, we will continue to focus on improving operational efficiency, increasing in-network revenues and expanding the continuum of care we offer our patients through enhanced alignment with primary care physician practices and growth of our vertically integrated services lines.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $86.8 million, a 14.8% decrease over the same period in the prior year. Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 continued to be impacted by Hurricane Harvey (Houston, Texas is our largest market) and the shift away from low margin lab business. Total case volume decreased by 161 cases to 5,846 cases in the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Fourth quarter 2017 revenue per case decreased to $14,848 as compared to prior year's revenue per case of $16,966.\nNet income attributable to Nobilis for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.6 million, or $0.05 per fully diluted share, as compared to the prior period of $9.4 million, or $0.12 per fully diluted share. Fourth quarter net income was impacted by $6.2 million deferred tax asset write-down. Absent of this write-down, net income for the fourth quarter would have been $9.8 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 for the fourth quarter of 2017, which adds back certain non-cash and non-recurring expenses, was $22.6 million, an increase of 8.9% over Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $20.8 million for the same period in the prior year.\nTotal cash was $22.5 million, accounts receivable was $144.5 million and total debt was $120.9 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $24.6 million, $125.0 million and $67.8 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Operating cash for the year was $26.4 million versus $1.6 million in 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue for 2017 increased to $299.7 million, a 4.9% increase over the prior year. Total case volume decreased by 1,184 cases, or 5.9%, to 18,757 in 2017, compared to the prior year. Revenue per case increased to $15,979 for 2017, as compared to $14,329 in the prior year, reflecting the impact of higher acuity case mix.\nNet income attributable to Nobilis for 2017 was $3.8 million, or $0.05 per fully diluted share, as compared to $6.4 million, or $0.08 per fully diluted share, in the same period the prior year. Absent the effects of recent tax reform legislation, net income for 2017 would have been $10.0 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 for the year ended 2017, which adds back certain non-cash and non-recurring expenses, was $41.4 million, a 21.9% increase over Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $34.0 million for the prior year.\nFull Year 2018 Guidance\nRevenue in the range of $345.0 million to $355.0 million Adjusted EBITDA of $57.0 million to $62.0 million\nConference Call Information\nNobilis Health will host a conference call on March 8, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. CT (9:00 a.m. ET) to discuss its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.

1\n$\n22,634\n$\n20,787\n$\n41,415\n$\n33,985\n1 Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash compensation expenses, change in fair value of warrant and stock option derivative liabilities, acquisition expenses, bargain purchase gain and non-recurring expenses. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of financial performance required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). Items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is an analytical indicator used by management and the health care industry to evaluate company performance, allocate resources and measure leverage and debt service capacity. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income, cash flows generated by operations, investing or financing activities, or other financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as indicators of financial performance or liquidity. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, Adjusted EBITDA as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nContact Information:\nTuan Tran\nVice President, Investor Relations\nIR@nobilishealth.com\n713-355-8614\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nobilis-health-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-financial-results-300610475.html\nSOURCE Nobilis Health Corp.",
