FILE PHOTO: An airport worker examines a flybe aircraft before it takes off from Liverpool John Lennon Airport in Liverpool northern England, May 19 , 2016. REUTERS/Phil Noble “The board of Stobart Group has determined that it is not in its shareholders’ best interests to increase its latest proposal for Flybe above the level which was rejected by the board of Flybe,” Stobart said in a statement on Thursday. “Given this, Stobart Group confirms that it does not intend to make an offer for Flybe.” Reporting by Sarah Young; editing by Kate Holton",
