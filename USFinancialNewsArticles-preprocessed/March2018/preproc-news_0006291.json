    "text": "BRIDGEWATER, N.J., March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Impax Laboratories, Inc. (NASDAQ: IPXL), today announced fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.\nFourth Quarter 2017\nTotal revenues in the fourth quarter 2017 were $182.9 million, a decrease of 7.8%, compared to $198.4 million in the prior year period due to a decrease in sales of generic products, partially offset by an increase in sales of specialty products. GAAP net loss was $301.1 million or a loss of $4.18 per share for the fourth quarter 2017, compared to a loss of $279.6 million or a loss of $3.91 per share in the prior year period. The fourth quarter of 2017 includes $230.7 million of non-cash intangible asset impairment charges on a few currently marketed and in-development generic products primarily due to competition, and a $74.1 million impairment charge associated with the sale of the Taiwan manufacturing facility. The fourth quarter of 2016 includes non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of $253.9 million due to competition and product discontinuations primarily related to certain products acquired in the Company's acquisition of Tower Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries in March 2015 (the \"Tower Acquisition\"). Adjusted net income was $7.6 million or $0.11 per share in the fourth quarter 2017, compared to $11.6 million or $0.16 per share in the prior year period, primarily due to lower generic product revenue. Refer to the attached \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for a reconciliation of all GAAP to non-GAAP items. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) was a loss of $274.8 million in the fourth quarter 2017, compared to a loss of $234.0 million in the prior year period, primarily as a result of the charges noted above. Adjusted EBITDA was $33.1 million, compared to $37.3 million in the prior year period.\nFull Year 2017\nTotal revenues for the full year 2017 were $775.8 million, a decrease of 5.9%, compared to $824.4 million in the prior year due to a decrease in sales of generic products, partially offset by an increase in sales of specialty products. GAAP net loss was $469.3 million or a loss of $6.53 per share for the full year 2017, compared to a loss of $472.0 million or a loss of $6.63 per share in the prior year, primarily a result of the items noted above. The full year 2017 GAAP results include $289.7 million of non-cash intangible asset impairment charges on a few currently marketed and in- development generic products primarily due to competition, and a $74.1 million impairment charge associated with the sale of the Taiwan manufacturing facility. The GAAP results for 2016 include non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of $541.6 million related to certain products acquired from Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. and affiliates of Allergan plc in August 2016 (the \"Teva Transaction\") and from the Tower Acquisition. Adjusted net income was $45.2 million or $0.63 per share for the full year 2017, compared to $83.7 million or $1.16 per share in the prior year, primarily due to lower generic product revenue caused by buyer consolidation and additional competition. Refer to the attached \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for a reconciliation of all GAAP to non-GAAP items. EBITDA for the full year 2017 was a loss of $303.8 million, compared to a loss of $453.0 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the charges noted above. Adjusted EBITDA was $149.8 million, compared to $200.4 million in the prior year.\n\"2017 was a year of transition for Impax,\" said Paul Bisaro, President and Chief Executive Officer of Impax. \"Throughout the year we successfully executed on our Path Forward growth strategy. We continued to build momentum in our Specialty Pharma franchise which delivered strong sales growth of Rytary ® with an increase of 24% over 2016. Our Generics franchise, facing a challenging generic market environment, worked hard to mitigate the impact of those challenges on our business. \"\n\"We also completed our operational and cost improvement program nearly one year ahead of schedule,\" continued Bisaro. \"Key highlights included the sale of our Taiwan manufacturing subsidiary for $18.5 million, completing the closure of our Middlesex, New Jersey R&D and packaging facility, and completing our product optimization strategies across our generic portfolio. These actions are expected to generate run-rate savings of approximately $85 million.\"\n\"We made significant progress in preparing for our combination with Amneal Pharmaceuticals. Integration planning teams are finalizing key Day 1 plans to ensure business continuity following the close of the transaction. We remain excited about the value of this combination, which will create a more diversified company with one of the industry's leading high-value generic product pipelines. We are currently on track to close the transaction in the second quarter of 2018 and expect to provide combined company full year 2018 guidance after the close of the transaction.\"\nBusiness Segment Information\nThe Company has two reportable segments, the Impax Generics division and the Impax Specialty Pharma division and does not allocate general corporate services to either segment.

Adjusted gross margin is calculated as adjusted gross profit divided by total revenues. Refer to the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP items.\nFourth Quarter 2017\nTotal revenues for the Generics division in the fourth quarter 2017 were $112.9 million, a decrease of 18.9%, compared to the prior year period. The decrease compared to the prior year period was primarily due to revenue reductions from increased competition on a few key products including diclofenac sodium gel, budesonide, fenofibrate and metaxalone, partially offset by higher revenue from epinephrine auto-injector and new product launches.\nGross margin in the fourth quarter 2017 was a loss of 33.5%, compared to a loss of 126.7% in the prior year period, primarily due to significantly lower impairment charges during the fourth quarter 2017. Adjusted gross margin in the fourth quarter 2017 declined to 31.3%, compared to 32.8% in the prior year period, primarily due to product sales mix.\nTotal operating expenses in the fourth quarter 2017 were $175.1 million, compared to $35.6 million in the prior year period, primarily due to significantly higher in-process research and development impairment charges as a result of either delays in the anticipated launch or additional competition on a few products acquired in the Teva Transaction. The Company also incurred fixed asset impairment charges related to the planned closure of the Middlesex, New Jersey manufacturing facility, which the Company subsequently sold in early 2018. The increase was partially offset by a change in the fair value of contingent consideration for generic Concerta® based on the Company's review of the anticipated timing and probability of the products launch and an assessment of the number of competitors expected in the market.\nFull Year 2017\nTotal revenues for the Generics division for the full year 2017 were $549.1 million, a decrease of 9.4%, over the prior year. The decrease compared to the prior year was primarily due to increased competition on diclofenac sodium gel, metaxalone, generic Adderall XR® and fenofibrate. These decreases were partially offset by increased revenues from epinephrine auto-injector, budesonide and other products acquired as part of the Teva Transaction compared to the prior year.\nGross margin for the full year 2017 was a loss of 0.5%, compared to a loss of 45.4% in the prior year, primarily due to lower impairment charges during 2017. Adjusted gross margin for the full year 2017 declined to 38.1%, compared to 39.3% in the prior year, primarily due to product sales mix.\nTotal operating expenses for the full year 2017 were $262.5 million, compared to $111.1 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to in-process research and development impairment charges and fixed assets impairment charges, partially offset by a change in the fair value of contingent consideration, as noted above, compared to the prior year.\nImpax Specialty Pharma Division Information\n(Unaudited; In thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nRevenues:\nRytary® sales, net\n$ 28,290\n$ 21,803\n$ 91,637\n$ 73,833\nZomig® sales, net\n15,034\n13,576\n51,115\n53,539\nAll Other Specialty Pharma Product sales, net\n26,643\n23,817\n83,958\n90,737\nTotal revenues\n69,967\n59,196\n226,710\n218,109\nCost of revenues\n19,679\n19,667\n80,212\n69,583\nCost of revenues impairment charges\n-\n24,313\n-\n24,313\nGross profit\n50,288\n15,216\n146,498\n124,213\nOperating expenses:\nSelling, general and administrative\n18,670\n15,139\n67,949\n61,448\nResearch and development\n3,077\n4,662\n17,602\n18,486\nIn-process research and development impairment charges\n-\n11,973\n-\n25,200\nFixed asset impairment charges\n74,128\n-\n74,128\n-\nPatent litigation expense\n1,111\n879\n4,278\n6,990\nTotal operating expenses\n96,986\n32,653\n163,957\n112,124\n(Loss) income from operations\n$(46,698)\n$(17,437)\n$(17,459)\n$ 12,089\nGross margin\n71.9%\n25.7%\n64.6%\n56.9%\nAdjusted gross profit (a)\n$ 55,940\n$ 46,945\n$ 170,916\n$ 174,417\nAdjusted gross margin (a)\n80.0%\n79.3%\n75.4%\n80.0%\n(a) Adjusted gross profit is calculated as total revenues less adjusted cost of revenues.

Refer to the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP items.\nFourth Quarter 2017\nTotal revenues for the Specialty Pharma division in the fourth quarter 2017 were $70.0 million, an increase of 18.2%, compared to the prior year period, driven by higher revenue from Rytary ® , Zomig ® and the anthelmintic products franchise.\nGross margin in the fourth quarter 2017 was 71.9%, compared to 25.7% in the prior year period, primarily due to impairment charges in the fourth quarter 2016 for which there were no comparable amounts in the fourth quarter of 2017. Adjusted gross margin in the fourth quarter 2017 was 80.0%, compared to 79.3% in the prior year period, primarily due to product sales mix.\nTotal operating expenses in the fourth quarter 2017 were $97.0 million, compared to $32.7 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to fixed asset impairment charges associated with the Company's entry into an agreement with a third party to sell its Taiwan subsidiary and Taiwan operations, partially offset by lower in-process research and development impairment charges, compared to the prior year period. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter 2017 increased compared to the prior year period due to restructuring and severance-related charges as a result of a reorganization within the division.\nFull Year 2017\nTotal revenues for the Specialty Pharma division for the full year 2017 were $226.7 million, an increase of 3.9% over the prior year. The increase from the prior year was primarily due to higher revenue from Rytary, partially offset by lower sales of our anthelmintic products franchise and Zomig.\nGross margin for the full year 2017 was 64.6%, compared to 56.9% in the prior year primarily due to impairment charges in 2016 for which there were no comparable amounts in 2017. Adjusted gross margin for the full year 2017 was 75.4%, compared to 80.0% in the prior year, primarily due to product sales mix.\nTotal operating expenses for the full year 2017 were $164.0 million, compared to $112.1 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to fixed asset impairment charges, partially offset by lower in-process research and development impairment charges, as noted above, compared to the prior year.\nCorporate and Other Information\n(Unaudited; In thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n$ 37,123\n$ 34,381\n$ 120,027\n$ 119,874\nUnallocated corporate expenses\n$ (37,123)\n$ (34,381)\n$ (120,027)\n$ (119,874)\nFourth Quarter 2017\nGeneral and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter 2017 were $37.1 million, compared to $34.4 million in the prior year period, primarily due to higher business development expenses partially offset by lower restructuring and severance related charges.\nFull Year 2017\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the full year 2017 were $120.0 million, compared to $119.9 million for the full year 2016.\nInterest expense, net for the full year 2017 was $53.4 million, an increase of $13.0 million compared to the prior year, due to the $400.0 million Term Loan Facility entered into by the Company in the third quarter 2016 to finance the Teva Transaction.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call with a slide presentation on March 1, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET to discuss its results.

However, management uses both GAAP financial measures and the disclosed non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate and manage the Company's operations and to better understand its business. Further, management believes the addition of non-GAAP financial measures provides meaningful supplementary information to, and facilitates analysis by, investors in evaluating the Company's financial performance, results of operations and trends. The Company's calculations of adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted cost of revenues, adjusted research and development expenses and adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, may not be comparable to similarly designated measures reported by other companies, since companies and investors may differ as to what type of events warrant adjustment.\nThe following table reconciles reported net loss to adjusted net income:\n(Unaudited; In thousands, except per share data)\nThree months ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet loss\n$(301,070)\n$(279,585)\n$(469,287)\n$(472,031)\nAdjusted to add (deduct):\nAmortization (a)\n16,909\n16,886\n68,375\n56,490\nNon-cash interest expense (b)\n6,660\n6,241\n25,950\n22,846\nBusiness development expenses (c)\n8,061\n251\n11,097\n4,540\nIntangible asset impairment charges (d)\n230,692\n253,873\n289,674\n541,597\nFixed asset impairment charges (e)\n79,705\n-\n82,508\n-\nReserve for Turing receivable (f)\n1,328\n(7,731)\n3,999\n40,312\nTuring legal expenses (g)\n642\n2,111\n451\n7,554\nRestructuring and severance charges (h)\n13,483\n11,705\n49,563\n24,040\nGain on sale of assets (i)\n(656)\n-\n(17,236)\n-\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n-\n-\n1,215\n-\nInventory related charges (j)\n6,224\n-\n26,702\n-\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration (k)\n(38,123)\n-\n(31,048)\n-\nLegal settlements\n-\n-\n7,900\n-\nOther\n-\n2,762\n2,534\n3,684\nIncome tax effect (l)\n(16,213)\n5,136\n(7,205)\n(145,368)\nAdjusted net income\n$ 7,642\n$ 11,649\n$ 45,192\n$ 83,664\nAdjusted net income per diluted share\n$ 0.11\n$ 0.16\n$ 0.63\n$ 1.16\nNet loss per diluted share\n$ (4.18)\n$ (3.91)\n$ (6.53)\n$ (6.63)\nAdjusted diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding\n72,634,828\n71,488,634\n71,857,096\n71,829,749\nImpax Laboratories, Inc.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n(a)\nReflects amortization of intangible assets from the portfolio of products acquired from Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. and affiliates of Allergan plc (the \"Teva Transaction\") in August 2016 and from the acquisition of Tower Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries in March 2015 (the \"Tower Acquisition\").\n(b)\nRelated to non-cash accretion of debt discount attributable to deferred financing costs associated with the $400.0 million term loan facility (the \"Term Loan Facility\") to finance the Teva Transaction and the $600.0 million of outstanding 2% convertible senior notes, as well as bifurcation of the conversion option of the convertible notes.\n(c)\nBusiness development expenses are professional fees primarily related to the Teva Transaction and the proposed combination with Amneal Pharmaceuticals that the Company announced in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n(d)\nThe Company recognized $186.7 million of impairment charges on in process research and development (IPR&D) product rights in the fourth quarter 2017, primarily related to two products acquired in the Teva Transaction, resulting from delays in launch and increased competition. The Company additionally incurred $44.0 million of fourth quarter impairment charges on two marketed products acquired in the Teva Transaction and Tower Acquisition, due to increased competition and related price erosion.\n(e)\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, the Company recorded fixed asset impairment charges of $79.7 million primarily related to the Taiwan and Middlesex, New Jersey facilities. Sales of both the Taiwan and Middlesex facilities were completed during the first quarter 2018.\n(f)\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, the Company increased the estimated receivable due from Turing Pharmaceuticals AG (\"Turing\") by $1.3 million to reflect additional estimated Medicaid rebate claims due from Turing.\n(g)\nThe Company recorded a charge in the fourth quarter 2017 for legal fees incurred as a result of the Company's litigation against Turing alleging breach of the terms of the Turing Asset Purchase Agreement in the Company's sale of Daraprim ® resulting from Turing's failure to reimburse the Company for chargebacks and Medicaid rebate liability.\n(h)\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, the Company recorded restructuring, severance and other plant-related charges of $13.5 million related to the closure of its manufacturing, packaging and R&D operations at the Middlesex, New Jersey site as well as charges related to the reorganization of its Specialty Pharma division.\n(i)\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, the Company recorded a gain on the sale of an ANDA related to the Company's Middlesex, New Jersey facility.\n(j)\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, the Company recorded an approximate $6.2 million charge related to an unfavorable supply agreement associated with its exit of the Middlesex site.\n(k)\nRepresents the reduction in contingent consideration liability related to a product acquired in the Teva Transaction.
