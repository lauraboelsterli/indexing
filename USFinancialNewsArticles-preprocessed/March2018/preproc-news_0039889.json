    "text": "0 COMMENTS Gold prices rose Wednesday, hours ahead of what many believe will be the Federal Reserveâ€™s first interest-rate increase of 2018.\nGold for April delivery was recently up 0.7%, at $1,321.50 a troy ounce, on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.\nA worker lifts a bar of gold bullion from a conveyor at a plant in Germiston, South Africa. Photo: Waldo Swiegers/Bloomberg News Market participants expect the Fed to announce a 25 basis point interest-rate increase at the conclusion of its meeting Wednesday afternoon. Many will also be looking for more clarity on whether the central bank plans to tighten monetary policy at a faster clip later this year to prevent the economy from overheating.\nSigns that the central bank may be growing more hawkish are likely to weigh on gold, which struggles to compete with yield-bearing investments when borrowing costs rise.\nIn base metals, copper for May delivery was recently up 0.2%, at $3.04 a pound.\nWrite to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com",
