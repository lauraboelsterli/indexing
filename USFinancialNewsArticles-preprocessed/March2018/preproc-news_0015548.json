    "text": "ALPHARETTA, Ga., March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aptean, a global provider of mission-critical enterprise software solutions, has acquired IndustryBuilt Ltd., a leading provider of industry-specific ERP solutions. The acquisition of IndustryBuilt extends Aptean’s capabilities in the food and beverage market, a key growth area for the company.\nIndustryBuilt’s core product is JustFood, a comprehensive ERP solution purpose-built for food and beverage manufacturers and distributors. The company also offers EquipSoft, an ERP solution for equipment dealerships that helps optimize rentals, service, sales, parts and fleet management activities. Both products are built on the Microsoft® Dynamics platform and are offered both on-premise and in the cloud.\n“Process manufacturing, particularly in the food and beverage industry, is a strategic growth segment for Aptean,” said Aptean CEO Kim Eaton. “Aptean Ross ERP, along with our integrated manufacturing execution, enterprise asset management and warehouse management systems, has been the cornerstone of our food and beverage suite, providing industry-leading capabilities such as traceability, food safety and quality controls. With strong SaaS and traditional license offerings, JustFood expands our capabilities into several sub-segments of that important market. We’ll be able to offer a more complete suite of solutions for food and beverage manufacturers and continue the significant momentum that both products have built in the market.”\n“By joining Aptean and becoming part of a larger organization, we’ll gain access to new geographic markets as well as considerable capabilities that will help us accelerate product innovation and continue to increase our customer base,” said David Pilz, CEO of IndustryBuilt. “In the end, our JustFood and EquipSoft customers will have access to more resources than ever before, including Aptean’s vast service and support organizations. Additionally, our customers will be able to benefit from other Aptean solutions that are tailored for both the food and beverage and equipment dealership industries. We’re excited to become part of the Aptean team.”\n“Aptean will continue to accelerate its investment in both Ross and the newly acquired IndustryBuilt products,” Eaton said. “With both offerings, we’ll be able to serve the market more broadly and address a wider range of operational complexity with our leading, industry-specific products.”\nMore than 130 employees of IndustryBuilt, which is headquartered in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, will join Aptean. Financial terms of the sale will not be disclosed. IndustryBuilt was advised in the transaction by Mooreland Partners.\nABOUT INDUSTRYBUILT SOFTWARE\nIndustryBuilt is the creator of JustFood and EquipSoft ERP software.
