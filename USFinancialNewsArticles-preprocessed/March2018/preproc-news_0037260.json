(\"Merger Sub\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of General Dynamics with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") on March 5, 2018, as amended from time to time. CSRA has filed a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with the SEC with respect to the Offer on March 5, 2018, as amended from time to time. CSRA's stockholders are urged to read these documents carefully as they become available because they contain important information that they should consider before making any decision regarding tendering their shares of CSRA's common stock. The Offer materials and the Solicitation/Recommendation Statement are available for free at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov . The offer to purchase and related materials may also be obtained for free by contacting the information agent for the Offer.\nIn connection with the potential merger, CSRA has filed a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC, as well as other relevant materials in connection with the proposed transaction pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated February 9, 2018, among General Dynamics, Merger Sub and CSRA. The materials filed and to be filed by CSRA will be made available to CSRA's investors and stockholders at no expense to them and copies may be obtained free of charge on CSRA's website at www.CSRA.com . In addition, all of those materials will be available at no charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov . Investors and stockholders of CSRA are urged to read the proxy statement and the other relevant materials when they become available before making any voting or investment decision with respect to the proposed merger because they contain important information about the merger and the parties to the merger.\nCSRA and its directors, executive officers, other members of its management and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies of CSRA stockholders in connection with the proposed merger under SEC rules. Investors and security holders may obtain more detailed information regarding the names, affiliations and interests of certain of CSRA's executive officers and directors in the solicitation by reading CSRA's proxy statement for its 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, and the proxy statement filed in connection with the merger and other relevant materials that may be filed with the SEC when they become available.
