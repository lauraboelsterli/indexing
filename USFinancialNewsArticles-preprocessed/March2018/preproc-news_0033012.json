    "text": "JUPITER, Fla., March 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dyadic International, Inc. (“Dyadic”) (OTCQX:DYAI), today announced that Chief Financial Officer Thomas L. Dubinski will be on a medical leave of absence, effectively immediately. In Mr. Dubinski’s absence, other executive officers will assume many of Mr. Dubinski’s duties while remaining in their current positions. Ping W. Rawson, the Company’s Director of Financial Reporting since June 2016, was promoted to Chief Accounting Officer on March 14, 2018 and will serve as the Company’s principal financial officer and assume responsibility for finance, tax and treasury.\nAbout Dyadic International, Inc.\nDyadic International, Inc. is a global biotechnology company which is developing what it believes will be a potentially significant biopharmaceutical gene expression platform based on the fungus Myceliophthora thermophila , nicknamed C1. The C1 microorganism, which enables the development and large-scale manufacture of low cost proteins, has the potential to be further developed into a safe and efficient expression system that may help speed up the development, lower production costs and improve the performance of biologic vaccines and drugs at flexible commercial scales. Dyadic is using the C1 technology and other technologies to conduct research, development and commercial activities for the development and manufacturing of human and animal vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, biosimilars and/or biobetters, and other therapeutic proteins. Dyadic pursues research and development collaborations, licensing arrangements and other commercial opportunities with its partners and collaborators to leverage the value and benefits of using these technologies in the development and manufacture of biopharmaceuticals. In particular, as the aging population grows in developed and undeveloped countries, Dyadic believes the C1 technology may help bring biologic drugs to market faster, in greater volumes, at lower cost, and with new properties to drug developers and manufacturers and, hopefully, improve access and cost to patients and the healthcare system, but most importantly save lives.\nPlease visit Dyadic’s website at www.dyadic.com for additional information, including details regarding Dyadic’s plans for its biopharmaceutical business.\nDyadic trades on the OTCQX tier of the OTC marketplace. Investors can find real-time Quote: s, market information and financial reports for Dyadic in the Company’s annual and quarterly reports which are filed with the OTC markets.
