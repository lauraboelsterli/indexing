    "text": "DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s privately owned Farabi Petrochemicals Company has shortlisted a group of banks to finance the development of a new petrochemical complex worth 4 billion riyals ($1.07 billion), banking sources familiar with the matter said.\nThe company will borrow around 3 billion riyals for the project, they said.\nThe sources said HSBC is advising Farabi on financing for the new project, which will be built in Yanbu, a port city on Saudi Arabia’s western Red Sea coast which is already home to several refineries and petrochemicals plants.\nThe Saudi Industrial Development Fund is expected to lend 1.2 billion riyals, while banks will provide another 1.7 billion riyals, one of the sources said.\nFarabi did not reply to a request for comment.\nFarabi, established in 2002, currently has production facilities at Jubail industrial city in Saudi Arabia’s Eastern Province, where it produces petrochemical products such as paraffin and benzene.\nThe financing should be finalised in the second quarter of this year, the sources said.\nLarsen & Toubro, an Indian construction engineering company, has been hired as engineering, procurement and construction contractor for the Yanbu complex, Farabi said last year.\n($1 = 3.7500 riyals)\nReporting by Davide Barbuscia and Katie Paul.
