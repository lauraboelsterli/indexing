    "text": "* Weekly jobless claims rise 3,000\n* Four-week average of claims increases 2,250\n* Continuing claims decline 57,000\n  unexpectedly rose last week, but the increase was marginal, suggesting  \n  Data for the prior week was unrevised. Claims  \nThe labor market is considered to be near or at full employment. The jobless rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, not too far from the Federal Reserve's forecast of 3.8 percent by the end of this year.\nThe U.S. central bank raised interest rates on Wednesday and forecast at least two more hikes for 2018, in a vote of confidence in the economy. The Fed said it expected that \"labor market conditions will remain strong.\"\nThe Labor Department said claims for Maine and Colorado were estimated last week. It also said claims-taking procedures in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands had still not returned to normal after the territories were devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria last year.\nThe four-week moving average of initial claims, viewed as a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 2,250 to 223,750 last week. The claims data covered the survey period for March nonfarm payrolls.\nThe four-week average of claims fell 1,750 between the February and March survey periods, suggesting another month of solid job gains. The economy created 313,000 jobs in February.\nEconomists are optimistic that tightening labor market conditions will start boosting wage growth in the second half of this year. That should help to support consumer spending, which slowed at the start of the year.\nThe claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 57,000 to 1.83 million in the week ended March 10.\nThe four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims dropped 11,750 to 1.88 million.\n(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)",
