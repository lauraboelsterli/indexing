We made significant progress on operational and technology initiatives and delivered strong Revenue and EBITDA growth,” said Ted Daniel, Chief Executive Officer of Titanium Transportation Group. “In recent months we have seen improving industry dynamics reflecting tightening capacity and an increasing rate environment. Our continued investment in people and technology, along with a focus on driving increased organic growth, positions us well to respond to and benefit from a strengthening environment. ”\n“With our infrastructure firmly in place to take advantage of improving market conditions, we are increasing our revenue and EBITDA run rate to $155 million and $16 million respectively. Looking ahead, we expect market conditions to support stronger organic growth in 2018 enhanced by acquisitions should the right opportunities present themselves.”\nMr. Daniel added, “We are committed to creating value through organic growth as well as acquisitions. However, we are sharply focused on disciplined capital allocation to ensure we are generating the highest long-term shareholder return.”\nSummary of Consolidated Financial Results\nQ4\n2017 Q4\n2016 % Change 2017 2016 % Change Revenue $35.4M $28.6M +24% $129.6M $116.6M +11% EBITDA $3.5M $3.1M +14% $12.6M $11.9M +6% EBITDA margin 10.5% 11.3% 10.3% 10.8% Adjusted net income (1) $0.0M $0.1M $0.4M ($0.1M) Adjusted net income per share (1) $0.00 $0.00 $0.01 ($0.00) Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share exclude the ProNorth Transportation settlement agreement and non-cash write downs\nQ4 2017 Truck Transportation Segment Highlights\nTotal revenue increased 20% to $24.1 million EBITDA increased 1% to $3.1 million EBITDA margin was 13.7%, a decline from 16.0% in Q4 2016\nQ4 2017 Logistics Segment Highlights\nTotal revenue increased 35% to $11.8 million EBITDA increased 82% to $0.9 million EBITDA margin increased to 7.9%, from 5.8% in Q4 2016\nConference Call\nThe Company will also hold a conference call for analysts and investors on Wednesday, March7, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time, to discuss fourth quarter financial results.

However, these financial measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements contained in this press release constitute forward-looking information within the meaning of Canadian securities laws. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purposes of assisting the reader in understanding Titanium's current expectations and plans relating to the future and readers are cautioned that such statements may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward-looking information may relate to Titanium's future outlook and anticipated events, and may include statements regarding the financial position, business strategy, budgets, litigation, projected costs, capital expenditures, financial results, taxes and plans and objectives of or involving Titanium. Particularly, statements regarding future acquisitions, the availability of credit, performance, achievements, prospects or opportunities for Titanium or the industry in which it operates are forward-looking statements. In some cases, forward-looking information can be identified by terms such as \"may\", \"might\", \"will\", \"could\", \"should\", \"would\", \"occur\", \"expect\", \"plan\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"intend\", \"seek\", \"aim\", \"estimate\", \"target\", \"project\", \"predict\", \"forecast\", \"potential\", \"continue\", \"likely\", \"schedule\", or the negative thereof or other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. For greater certainty and notwithstanding the foregoing, annualized run rate total revenue and EBITDA are not presented herein as forward-looking statements. These annualized figures are based solely on historical data and are included to allow readers to understand the current size of the Company, and should not in any circumstance be construed as projections or forecasts of the Company's future performance.\nInformation contained in forward-looking statements is based upon certain material assumptions that were applied in drawing a conclusion or making a forecast or projection, including management's perceptions of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other considerations that are believed to be appropriate in the circumstances. While management considers these assumptions to be reasonable based on currently available information, they may prove to be incorrect.\nThe forward-looking statements made in this press release are dated, and relate only to events or information, as of the date of this press release. Except as specifically required by law, Titanium undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\nNeither the TSX-V nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX-V) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nCONTACT INFORMATION\nTitanium Transportation Group Inc.\nKasia Malz, CPA, CA\nChief Financial Officer\n(905) 266-3036\ninvestors@ttgi.com\nwww.ttgi.com\nSource:Titanium Transportation Group Inc",
