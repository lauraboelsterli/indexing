    "text": "March 1, 2018 / 9:15 PM / Updated 5 minutes ago Microchip Technology to buy Microsemi for about $8.35 billion Reuters Staff 1 Min Read (Reuters) - Microchip Technology said on Thursday it had agreed to buy Microsemi Corp, the largest U.S. commercial supplier of military and aerospace semiconductor equipment, for about $8.35 billion. Microchip’s offer of $68.78 per share in cash for Microsemi represents an about 7 percent premium to its closing price on Thursday. Reuters, citing a source, reported earlier this week that Microchip was in talks to buy Aliso Viejo, California-based Microsemi. Microchip said on Thursday the deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018, would immediately add to its adjusted earnings per share. The Arizona-based chipmaker expects an estimated $300 million in savings in the third year after the deal close. J.P. Morgan, which is providing $5.6 billion in committed financing for the deal, was Microchip’s financial adviser, and Qatalyst Partners advised Microsemi.
