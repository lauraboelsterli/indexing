Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share for the quarter were $0.09 compared to $0.05 last year. Specialty Solutions segment operating profit for the quarter was $13.6 million compared to $9.5 million last year. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit for Specialty Solutions was $14.7 million, up 52% from $9.7 million last year, driven by higher volumes, stronger margins and favorable foreign exchange. Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA improved to 3.3x from 3.6x at the end of last year's first quarter. In December 2017, the Company pre-paid $40 million of Term Loan B debt. In March 2018, the Company refinanced its Term Loan B debt reducing the rate spread by 100 basis points. The Company's 2018 full year performance expectations are unchanged - the fourth consecutive year of adjusted diluted earnings per share growth.\nOMNOVA Solutions Inc. (NYSE: OMN) Chief Executive Officer Anne Noonan, commenting on the first quarter of fiscal 2018, said, \"We were pleased to record another quarter of sales and profit growth in our Specialty Solutions segment. We saw particular volume strength in our Oil & Gas business, and good volume growth across other Specialty Solutions businesses, including home & personal care, adhesives & sealants, elastomeric modifiers and laminates & films. Oil & Gas is benefiting from investments we made during the downturn to diversify its product portfolio and geographic offerings, which accelerated its improvement over last year's relatively weak first quarter results. In addition to improved volumes, Specialty Solutions profitability was also driven by stronger margins and favorable foreign exchange. At the end of the first quarter, Specialty Solutions accounted for 61% of total Company net sales and 87% of segment profitability as our specialization strategy continues to gain momentum.\n\"Performance Materials volume was down 11% excluding the impact of the sale of China Coated Fabrics in July of 2017. As expected, the paper market was the largest driver of the decline as we transition out of the commodity-like portions of this market. The volume declines were partially offset by another quarter of volume growth in the carpet business. Margins were unfavorably impacted by increases in raw material prices and a slower start in several of our higher margin lines of business including antioxidants, coated fabrics and reinforcing resins. We expect raw material pricing to stabilize with some pricing recovery over the remainder of the year.\n\"For 2018 our guidance remains unchanged; we continue to expect our fourth consecutive year of Adjusted EPS growth. The momentum in our specialization strategy should offset the headwinds we have been facing as we reposition Performance Materials away from its paper-focused heritage. We expect volume growth in specialties to continue, but not at the pace seen in the first quarter,\" concluded Noonan.\nConsolidated Results for the First Quarter of Fiscal 2018\nEarnings per diluted share for the first quarter ended February 28, 2018 was $0.16, compared to $0.08 last year. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded charges of $2.9 million primarily for restructuring and severance and costs associated with prepaying $40 million on the Company's Term Loan B credit facility. In the first quarter of 2017, the Company recorded charges of $1.0 million related to restructuring and severance.\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings per Share (Adjusted EPS) was $0.09 for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $0.05 last year. The increase in Adjusted EPS was the result of the strong performance in Specialty Solutions partially offset by Performance Materials.\nNet sales for the first quarter were $178.7 million, up 2.3% from last year's $174.6 million. China Coated Fabrics (CCF), which was sold in July 2017, accounted for $5.7 million of sales in last year's first quarter. Excluding the effect of CCF, sales increased 5.8% compared to the first quarter last year. Net sales in Specialty Solutions increased 16.5% to $109.2 million, while sales in Performance Materials decreased 14%, or 7.6% excluding the effect of CCF. Overall volume was favorable by $6.3 million, or 3.6%, as strong growth in Specialty Solutions more than offset the planned declines in paper. Mix was unfavorable by $4.1 million, or 2.4%. Currency translation was favorable by $7.4 million, or 4.3%, primarily reflecting the strengthening of the Euro.\nSG&A in the first quarter was $28.7 million, down from $29.2 million in the same quarter last year. The primary drivers of the decrease were benefits from the \"One OMNOVA\" cost reduction initiatives and the sale of CCF partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange.\nInterest expense for the quarter was $5.1 million compared to $5.2 million last year reflecting lower borrowing balances resulting from the December debt pre-payment, offset by increasing interest rates.\nIncome tax benefit in the first quarter of 2018 was $5.1 million compared to $1.6 million in 2017. The increase in the first quarter tax benefit compared to 2017 relates to U.S. Tax Reform and French legislative impacts, both of which reduced statutory tax rates. U.S. cash tax payments were minimal as the Company has approximately $91.1 million of U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards and $86.8 million of state and local tax net operating loss carryforwards.\nWorking capital days at the end of February 2018 were 67.3, 1.8 days favorable compared to last February. In spite of the favorable working capital days, cash used by operations in the first quarter of 2018 was $8.0 million, compared to $4.7 million last year, reflecting an increase in accounts receivable due to the higher sales and higher inventory levels. Trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA increased to $87.4 million from $81.6 million in the comparable period. Adjusted net leverage improved to 3.3x adjusted EBITDA as compared to 3.6x last year (see Tables C and D), reflecting the increases in earnings.\nSpecialty Solutions Segment Results\nNet sales for Specialty Solutions during the first quarter of 2018 increased $15.5 million, or 16.5%, to $109.2 million, compared with $93.7 million last year. The improvement was driven by strong volume increases of $15.2 million, or 16.1%, partially offset by mix decreases of $4.0 million, or 4.3%. Foreign currency translation had a favorable effect of $4.3 million, or 4.5%. Volumes were exceptionally strong in Oil & Gas compared to last year's relatively modest results. Volumes were also improved across a number of the other specialty businesses including laminates & films, elastomeric modifiers, home & personal care and adhesives & sealants.\nSegment Operating Profit was $13.6 million compared with $9.5 million last year. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit grew 52% to $14.7 million, or 13.5% of net sales, compared to $9.7 million or 10.4% of net sales last year. (See Tables A and B.) Increased volume and the benefits of cost controls drove the improvement in operating profit.\nPerformance Materials Segment Results\nNet sales for Performance Materials during the first quarter of 2018 were $69.5 million compared to $80.9 million last year. The divested CCF business accounted for $5.7 million of net sales in the first quarter of 2017. Volume, excluding CCF was down $8.9 million, or 11%, primarily driven by sales into the coated paper market. The Company is transitioning out of the commodity portions of this market and expects continued volume declines as a result. In addition to paper, volume was seasonally soft in tire cord, antioxidants and reinforcing resins. Sales into the carpet market, which are benefiting from new product initiatives, were strong.\nPerformance Materials' segment operating profit for the quarter was $2.1 million, compared with $4.7 million last year. Adjusted Segment Operating Profit was $2.3 million or 3.3% of net sales, compared to $5.1 million, or 6.3% of net sales, last year. (See Tables A and B.) In addition to the impact from the volume declines, margins were unfavorably impacted by increases in raw material prices and the slower start in several of our higher margin Performance Materials businesses.\nEarnings Conference Call - OMNOVA Solutions has scheduled its Earnings Conference Call for March 28, 2018, at 11:00 a.m. ET.

Management reviews the adjusted financial measures in assessing the performance of the business segments and in making decisions regarding the allocation of resources to the business segments. Management also believes that the adjusted information is useful for providing investors with an understanding of the Company's business and operating performance. Management excludes the items shown in the tables below because Management does not consider them to be reflective of normal operations. These adjusted financial measurements are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and such financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to Segment Operating Profit, Net Income, Diluted Earnings Per Share or other measures of financial performance determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Presented on Tables C and D is the Company's Net Leverage Ratio calculation (Net Debt / Adjusted EBITDA). Presented on Table E is the Company's Adjusted Return on Invested Capital calculation (Adjusted Net Operating Profit After Tax / Total Debt and Equity). The tables below provide the reconciliation of these financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures.\nReconciliation of Reported Segment Net Sales and Operating Profit to Net Sales and
