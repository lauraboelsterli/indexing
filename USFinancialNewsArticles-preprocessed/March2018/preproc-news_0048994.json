    "text": "SALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- LLR Partners today announced the closing of a $30 million minority growth equity investment in Midigator . Midigator provides an industry-leading, fully-automated software platform to prevent, analyze and manage payment card chargebacks, thereby increasing merchant revenue and lowering costs. Key features of the platform include automated chargeback prevention alerts, intelligent chargeback representments with industry leading win-rates and real-time data analytics and reporting.\n“Merchants, small and large, are struggling to keep pace with the rapid growth of fraud and payment card chargebacks. Midigator’s fully-automated software platform is uniquely positioned to help processors, acquiring banks, ISOs and merchants prevent and manage chargebacks,” said Corey Baggett, Founder & CEO of Midigator. “We are excited to welcome LLR as a strategic investor in our company – their deep payments experience and relationships across the financial services and technology ecosystems should help accelerate our next stage growth. This partnership is another step towards our goal of becoming the global standard for chargeback management and fraud mitigation.\"\nLLR is partnering with the existing Midigator management team to help expand product capabilities, fuel sales growth and build upon Midigator’s market leadership position in the rapidly growing, $6 billion per year card-not-present fraud market.
