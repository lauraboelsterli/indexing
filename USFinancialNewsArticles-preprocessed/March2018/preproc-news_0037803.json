This is targeted for 2019.\nBecause of its acquisition of Thunder Mountain, Bonanza Goldfields has elected not to proceed with acquisition of the mining properties at Chloride, Arizona or Goldfield, Nevada. The Company now has four active mining projects:\nThunder Mountain Gold Comstock Gold (50% interest in Monte Cristo Mine) Congress Gold (Tarantula and Golden Horseshoe) Oatman Gold (Tom Reed Jr. and Argo Mines)\nAbout Bonanza Goldfields Corp.: BONZ is a Las Vegas–based mineral exploration and mining company.
