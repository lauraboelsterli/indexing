    "text": "HOUSTON, March 5 (Reuters) - Moelis & Co said on Monday it hired industry veteran Martin Houston as chairman of the investment banking boutique’s global energy group.\nHouston has worked in the energy industry for almost four decades, including for over 20 years at BG Group where he rose to become chief operating officer before retiring in 2014. He also co-founded Tellurian Inc and continues to serve as vice chairman of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) firm.\nAccording to Moelis, Houston will work with the bank’s oil and gas clients globally as an advisory partner.\n“Martin’s sector knowledge and experience will be an invaluable resource to our clients as they seek to capture additional value in the midst of the global energy transition,” said Ken Moelis, chairman and CEO of the bank.\nAs well as working for Moelis, Houston will retain his existing executive and non-executive positions at other companies, including privately owned oil explorer CCC Energy and healthcare firm Bupa.
