    "text": "2 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—The number of Americans filing applications for new unemployment benefits fell last week, signaling continued health in the labor market.\nInitial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs across the U.S., fell by 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 226,000 in the week ended March 10, the Labor Department said Thursday. This matched expectations of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.\nWeekly jobless claims have held below 300,000 for about three years, the longest streak since 1970—when the U.S. population was far smaller than it is today.\nJobless claims data can be volatile from week to week. The four-week moving average, a steadier measure, fell by 750 to 221,500 last week.\nThe overall labor market remains broadly healthy. The unemployment rate has been parked at 4.1%, a 17-year low, for the past five months, and the U.S. economy added 313,000 jobs in February, the largest monthly gain since July 2016.\nThe number of claims workers made for longer than a week rose by 4,000 to 1,879,000 in the week ended March 3. Continuing claims are reported with a one-week lag.\nWrite to Sharon Nunn at sharon.nunn@wsj.com and Sarah Chaney at sarah.chaney@wsj.com",
