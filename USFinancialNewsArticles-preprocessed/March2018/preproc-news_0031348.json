    "text": "The lawyer for porn star Stormy Daniels said Friday that his client had been \"physically threatened\" to remain silent over her alleged affair with Donald Trump.\nLawyer Michael Avenatti, appearing on MSNBC's Morning Joe program and CNN's New Day, did not elaborate on who made the alleged threat or whether it occurred before or after she signed a non-disclosure agreement with Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, not to discuss her alleged relationship with Trump.\nTrump has denied any sexual relationship with Daniels.\nThe agreement was signed shortly before the 2016 presidential election. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, received $130,000 from Cohen after signing the deal.\nMore from USA Today:\nStormy Daniels launches crowd fundraiser to pay for legal costs in suit against Trump\nDid the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels break the law?\nStormy Daniels says fame from Trump scandal is a 'double-edged sword' for her career\nAsked by CNN's Chris Cuomo about the allegations of a physical threat against Daniels, Avenatti said it was not an allegation but a fact.\n\"The fact is that my client was physically threatened to stay silent about what she knew about Donald Trump,\" he said.\nThe lawyer said Daniels would discuss the issue on CBS' 60 Minutes in an already taped interview tentatively scheduled for broadcast March 25.\nAvenatti said Daniels is \"going to provide very specific details about what happened here.\"\n\"I am confident that the American people after this interview are going to come away to have little or no doubt that this woman is credible, is telling the truth and knows what she is talking about.\"",
