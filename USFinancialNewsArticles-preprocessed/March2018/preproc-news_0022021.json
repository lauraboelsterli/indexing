    "text": "Elon Musk Says SpaceX’s Mars Rocket Could Launch in Early 2019 SpaceX CEO Elon Musk on stage at South By Southwest on March 11th 2018. SXSW/YouTube By David Z. Morris 2:49 PM EDT \nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk said a rocket that’s intended to put humans on Mars could launch in early 2019. \n“We are building the first ship, the first Mars or interplanetary ship, right now,” Musk told screenwriter Jonathan Nolan on stage at the South By Southwest conference in Austin Sunday. “I think we’ll be able to do short flights, short up and down flights, sometime in the first half of next year.” \nThat timeline is surprisingly aggressive, and Musk admits that “historically people have told me my timelines have been optimistic.” The Falcon Heavy’s first launch was pushed back several times, and the Mars rocket is several times larger and more complex. The most that the public has seen of the rocket at this point is a design concept and a massive carbon-fiber fuel tank . \nThe rocket is currently code named BFR, of which Musk said: “It’s a bit of a Rorschach test in acronym form. [But] it is very big.” \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nHowever optimistic the timeline, the BFR’s first test flights would just be a preview of an actual crewed trip to Mars. SpaceX’s most recent plan has humans actually heading to Mars in 2022. \nMusk predicts that the first flights of the ship will unleash a flood of energy from other shipbuilders. “Once we have it, we’ll have a sort of point of proof, something that other countries and companies will go and do.” Musk says that he expects those other entities to eventually build interplanetary transport vehicles of their own. \nMusk also reiterated that he sees SpaceX’s role as simply creating the pathway to Mars, and that he hopes entrepreneurs will build much of the infrastructure of a future Mars colony, including everything from “iron foundries to pizza joints to nightclubs.” He also speculated that “most likely, the form of government on Mars would be somewhat of a direct democracy,” in which residents would vote directly on particular issues. \nMusk and Nolan’s conversation was streamed live from SXSW and should be viewable on YouTube .
