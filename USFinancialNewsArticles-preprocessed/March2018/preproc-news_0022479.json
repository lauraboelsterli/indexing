    "text": "11 COMMENTS The key question that European policy makers have been debating for the past year is this: Should reforms to strengthen the eurozone take place before or after an Italian crisis? \nOf course, no one publicly puts it quite so starkly. \nInstead, they hide behind technical language: They argue over whether the eurozone should prioritize “risk reduction” or “risk sharing.” But everyone knows what they mean. \nShould the eurozone arm itself with tools to tackle a Greek-style debt crisis in Italy—and perhaps even forestall it? Or should it wait until the markets conclude that the European Union’s third-largest economy’s debts are unsustainable and then clean up the mess?\nLast week, Italians answered the question for themselves. By voting to fill more than half their parliament with representatives of antiestablishment, euroskeptic parties , they almost certainly dashed any realistic prospect of eurozone leaders agreeing at a June summit to a package of far-reaching changes to the way that the eurozone is managed. That would include proposals to create a common budget to be overseen by a eurozone finance minister and the creation of a common deposit guarantee scheme to underpin the entire eurozone banking system.\nThat is a blow in particular to the European Commission and to French President Emmanuel Macron, who have invested significant political capital in these plans.\nTrue, an Italian crisis is by no means certain. Many investors have lost money betting on Italian crises in recent years and some will have done so again last week as the spread between Italian and German government bonds actually tightened. It is possible that out of the fog of the election, a new government will emerge that won’t damage a promising recovery. \nThe 5 Star Movement, which topped the polls with 32%, isn’t a conventional populist party and how its newly elected parliamentarians will act is unclear. The League, which won 18% of the vote, is a populist party—but it is in coalition with the mainstream center-right. The Democratic Party was heavily defeated but now holds the balance of power, and will stay in office until a new government is formed. “Italy is stable in its instability,” says one senior Italian political figure.\nNonetheless, the probability of an Italian crisis is higher after the election, not least because it confirmed that Italians continue to misdiagnose the source of their country’s problems. \nTo the extent that any coherent economic narrative emerged during the campaign, it laid the blame for Italy’s woeful economic underperformance on misguided EU fiscal orthodoxy, which demanded austerity in response to the global financial crisis, depriving the economy of domestic demand. In this way, Italians not only absolved themselves of responsibility for their own misfortunes, but also ignored the clear lessons to be learned from the robust recoveries elsewhere in the eurozone.\nWhat countries such as Spain, Ireland, the Netherlands and Baltic states have shown is that the long-running debate over austerity was a red herring. A country’s ability to prosper in a common market and common currency hinges on its ability to attract capital and people. \nRecent Italian governments have had some success overhauling the labor market, pension system and banking sector, making it easier for resources to flow toward productive sectors. Yet there was no debate during the election about how to tackle what investors and business leaders identify as Italy’s two greatest challenges: a poor-performing judicial system and inefficient public administration. Instead, the parties attempted to outbid each other with reckless fiscal promises and pledges to reverse prior reforms.\nThat said, the eurozone would have been unlikely to agree to an overhaul whatever the outcome of the Italian election.\nIn the eyes of many Northern European governments, Brussels and Paris are guilty of a similar misdiagnosis of what has gone wrong in the currency area. Finance ministers from six Nordic counties plus the Netherlands and Ireland set out their analysis of what can and should be done in a paper published last week that emphasizes the need for governments to create their own domestic fiscal buffers and improve economic performance via deeper structural reforms. \nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte made a similar point in a blunt speech this month demanding that EU members to show greater respect for existing EU rules: “A deal is a deal.”\nThere is another reason why governments are nervous of the Brussels and Paris agenda. They are fearful of what they might be asked to concede in pursuit of a grand bargain. \nIreland and the Baltic states fear being pushed to sacrifice their low corporate tax regimes, which are central to their economic models. Germany and the Netherlands, as major donors to the EU budget, fear the creation of a system of permanent EU fiscal transfers. \nIronically, one of the biggest obstacles to a deal is Italy, which will oppose any grand bargain that introduces limits on bank exposure to sovereign bonds or makes future bailouts conditional on debt restructuring. \nItaly is right to be nervous. If it does ever find itself in a crisis, its debt—the bulk of which is now held in domestic hands—probably will have to be restructured. Indeed, that may now have become a precondition for any far-reaching eurozone reform.\nWrite to Simon Nixon at simon.nixon@wsj.com",
