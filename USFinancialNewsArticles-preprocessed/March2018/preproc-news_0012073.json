    "text": "March 6, 2018 / 6:58 AM / Updated an hour ago UPDATE 2-South Africa's FirstRand joins optimistic chorus on Ramaphosa era Reuters Staff * CEO says very optimistic about future * FirstRand H1 profit growth slows to 6 pct vs 14 pct * Shares up 1.3 pct, lags rivals and broader market (Releads, adds details) By Tiisetso Motsoeneng JOHANNESBURG, March 6 (Reuters) - FirstRand gave a cautiously optimistic outlook on Tuesday, joining other South African businesses pinning their hopes on the country’s new political leadership. Companies in South Africa are banking on President Cyril Ramaphosa to follow through on promises to kick start the economy, fight corruption and bring policy certainty. Banks like FirstRand have largely borne the brunt of a stagnant economy and political uncertainty relating to corruption allegations surrounding former president Jacob Zuma, who denies any wrongdoing. “We are very optimistic about the future but we need to balance that with the fact that it would take time to fix some of the structural issues,” FirstRand’s outgoing chief executive Johan Burger told Reuters by telephone. Zuma was replaced last month by after a nine-year tenure of what analysts called economic mismanagement that led two credit rating agencies to downgrade the country’s debt to junk as a weak economy hit investment and consumption spending. “In the short to medium we’re still going to have relatively low economic growth rate,” Burger added after First Rand, the country’s biggest lender, reported a 6 percent increase in half-year diluted headline EPS, a key profit measure in South Africa, to 224 percent, a substantial slowdown from a year ago. CONFIDENCE RISING FirstRand, along with is rivals, has struggled to grow lending at a faster rate, as a stagnant economy and high personal debt levels have hit both investment and spending. Finance minister Nhlanhla Nene, part of Ramaphosa’s new team, said this week that 2018 economic growth forecasts — forecast to grow by 1.8 percent in a Reuters poll — would be revised upward by October due to improved business confidence. While higher, the rise in FirstRand’s EPS was less than half the 14 percent rise posted in the same period a year before, while net interest income, a key measure of lending profitability, increased 7 percent to 23.7 billion rand ($2.01 billion), it said in a results filing. Burger’s strategy has included reducing its reliance on South Africa and it has been looking at developed markets for growth, while scaling up branches elsewhere in Africa. FirstRand said it had secured regulatory approval for its 1.1 billion pound ($1.52 billion) acquisition of British banking newcomer Aldermore. Shares in FirstRand rose 1.3 percent to 75.20 rand as of 0909 GMT, lagging a 2.2 percent rise in the sector and the broader market.
