    "text": "Florida high school massacre survivor David Hogg, who along with some of his fellow teens have turned into fierce gun-control advocates, is asking his nearly 600,000 Twitter followers to boycott advertisers of Fox News host Laura Ingraham.\nThe conservative commentator mocked Hogg on Twitter on Wednesday after the 17-year-old revealed in an interview on TMZ that his applications were recently rejected by four University of California campuses. Ingraham tweeted: \"David Hogg Rejected By Four Colleges To Which He Applied and whines about it. (Dinged by UCLA with a 4.1 GPA...totally predictable given acceptance rates.)\"\nLaura Ingraham tweet\nHogg fired back with his own tweet calling on his followers to boycott Ingraham's advertisers. \"Pick a number 1-12 contact the company next to that #,\" he tweeted.\nDavid Hogg tweet\nTMZ producer Harvey Levin, who interviewed Hogg, was among many who responded to Ingraham's remarks. He tweeted: \"@IngrahamAngle David was not whining. I called him about the story. He was not feeling sorry for himself in the slightest. It was my idea that colleges should consider applicants who are so committed. Did you watch the video???\"\nHarvey Levin tweet\nHogg's 14-year-old sister Lauren, who also survived the mass shooting, came to her brother's defense as well, telling Ingraham to \"please grow up.\"\nLauren Hogg tweet\nHogg and Ingraham didn't immediately respond to CNBC to comment.\nWATCH: Dwyane Wade donates $200,000 to Parkland victims and sponsors art exhibit in their honor show chapters Dwyane Wade donates $200,000 to Parkland victims and sponsors art exhibit in their honor 1:00 PM ET Wed, 14 March 2018 | 01:11",
