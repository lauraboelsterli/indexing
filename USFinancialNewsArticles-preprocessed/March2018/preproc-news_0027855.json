    "text": "Investment Also Advances Development of Bullhorn’s Front Office and Workforce and Revenue Cloud Solutions\nBOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Bullhorn® , the cloud computing company that helps staffing and recruiting organizations transform their businesses, today announced that it has acquired Talent Rover and Jobscience, two of the leading providers of recruitment software built on the Salesforce platform. Terms of the transaction will not be disclosed. Following Bullhorn’s recent acquisition of the Salesforce-powered Connexys to serve customers in Europe, Talent Rover and Jobscience will help Bullhorn further its investments to serve those companies that have made a commitment to the Salesforce ecosystem in North America and the rest of the world. Furthermore, the additional resources afforded by Connexys, Talent Rover, and Jobscience will allow Bullhorn to accelerate the development and innovation of front and middle office capabilities for the world’s leading staffing and recruiting firms.\nAs many global enterprise staffing and recruiting firms look to rapidly scale their operations while also adapting to changing candidate preferences and evolving customer needs, they’re faced with unprecedented challenges in advancing their candidate-to-cash business processes. To support customers in navigating through this complex environment, Bullhorn has always offered an open ecosystem approach, evidenced by the largest staffing-centric Marketplace with more than 100 pre-integrated partners. Now, with a full range of Salesforce offerings in addition to Bullhorn’s award-winning platform, the company expands the choice of customer options for improving business operations. Bullhorn will continue to support and advance all three Salesforce-powered applications - Talent Rover, Jobscience, and Connexys - and, over time, Bullhorn will deliver new and expanded capabilities as part of the company’s Salesforce offerings, including best-of-breed VMS integration and middle office solutions.\n“Our experience with Connexys has demonstrated that we have an incredible opportunity to partner with Salesforce as we look to serve companies embracing the Salesforce platform and ecosystem,” said Art Papas, Bullhorn’s founder and CEO. “With these acquisitions, we are further expanding our long-standing commitment to an open ecosystem, and the additions of Talent Rover and Jobscience to the Bullhorn family will allow us to continue to deliver solutions that best fit our customers’ needs, whether deployed on the Salesforce or the Bullhorn platform.”\n“Furthermore, we’re making a major investment to deliver the most advanced recruitment and staffing software solutions in the market to our global enterprise customers,” Papas added. “Talent Rover and Jobscience have built fantastic businesses, and we’re looking forward to working with them to deliver leading-edge solutions to meet the evolving business needs of the enterprise.”\n“We’re excited to work with Bullhorn and Salesforce to deliver a unique offering that enables our branch offices worldwide to engage more fully with candidates and clients,” said Rob James, chief information officer of Adecco. “Further, as we look to the future, we believe there’s a big opportunity for innovation on the platform, which will transform the way we serve our customers and better support the candidate journey.”\nFounded in 2012, Talent Rover is a fast-growing, leading provider of global recruitment software powered by the Salesforce platform with a number of marquee enterprise customers. Talent Rover has built deep relationships with a number of global systems integrators, including Accenture and Slalom, and has also built out product integrations with Bullhorn partners such as CareerBuilder, Monster, LinkedIn, and Indeed.\nEstablished in 1999, Jobscience was the originator of recruiting software on the Salesforce platform and is the Salesforce market leader for recruiting software in terms of customers, awards, and investment on the platform. Jobscience has received numerous awards for customer success, and it has more than 500 customers worldwide. Jobscience has also created product integrations with Bullhorn partners including LinkedIn and Indeed.\n“We are very excited to join the Bullhorn family and look forward to contributing to their continued success,” said Kent Gray, co-founder and CEO of Talent Rover. “I believe the combination of superior technology and an unmatched brand will produce amazing results.”\n“I’ve been in this business for two decades now, building great products and working with amazing customers,” said Ted Elliott, CEO of Jobscience. “And joining the Bullhorn team is incredible news for our customers. It’s a great match strategically as we collectively look to provide world-class recruitment software rooted in innovative technology for enterprise recruiting companies across the world.”\nTalent Rover’s co-founders - Kent Gray and Brandon Metcalf - and Jobscience’s CEO - Ted Elliott - will join Bullhorn in executive leadership capacities to continue to help drive growth in the Salesforce ecosystem.\nBullhorn was advised by District Capital Partners and Morgan, Lewis & Bockius on the transaction.\nAbout Talent Rover\nBuilt on Salesforce technology, Talent Rover connects sales and recruiting teams, fully aligns front, middle, and back office operations, and harnesses the power of candidate and client relationships inside branded communities.
