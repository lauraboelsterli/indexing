    "text": "March 24, 2018 / 4:17 AM / a day ago Rugby-Key Crusaders Crotty and Whitelock injury fears subside Reuters Staff 2 Min Read WELLINGTON, March 24 (Reuters) - Canterbury Crusaders coach Scott Robertson breathed a massive sigh of relief on Saturday after injury scares to All Blacks duo Ryan Crotty and Sam Whitelock were found to be not as severe as initially feared. Crotty, who had missed the two previous matches due to concussion, was forced from the field in his side’s 33-14 victory over the Bulls on Friday in Christchurch for another head injury assessment. “He is clear, he is fine,” Robertson told reporters on Saturday. “He just got hit in a bit an awkward position in the shoulder, and the doc straight away said ‘let’s go have a look at him’. “But he is fine and passed the (HIA - head injury assessment) test. Everything is good.” Whitelock had also missed the last two games after failing an HIA against the Hurricanes. He was also replaced late on against the Bulls after a heavy collision, but Robertson said that was more precautionary than anything else. “I wasn’t taking any chances,” he added. “It was just time for those boys to come off. We needed to keep an eye on them because we know the first couple of weeks after a head knock are critical.” Whitelock’s leadership has been seen as pivotal for the Crusaders in the last 12 months and he now looms as a likely All Blacks captain in June if team mate Kieran Read is not available. Read underwent back surgery last year, but All Blacks coach Steve Hansen said that they would not rush him back for the test series against France if he was not ready. The Crusaders’ victory against the Bulls ensured the defending champions head to their rematch against last year’s beaten finalists the Lions in Johannesburg on a winning note after they had lost to the Hurricanes and Otago Highlanders. They then travel to Buenos Aires to face the Jaguares on April 7 before having their first bye. (Reporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by John O’Brien)",
