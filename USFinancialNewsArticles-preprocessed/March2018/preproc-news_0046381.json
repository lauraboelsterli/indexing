    "text": "March 27 (Reuters) - The Kentucky House passed legislation on Tuesday to ban a common abortion procedure once the patient reaches her 11th week of pregnancy, in what would amount to one of the strictest abortion limits in the United States.\nThe House voted 75-13 in favor of the measure, approving a bill passed last week by the Senate. The House had previously passed a similar version of the measure but had to approve changes the Senate made. Both bodies are controlled by Republicans.\nThe matter will now go for final approval to Governor Matt Bevin, a Republican who has described himself as “100 percent pro-life.” Officials at Bevin’s office could not immediately be reached for comment.
