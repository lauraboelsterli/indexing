    "text": "JOHANNESBURG--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Accenture (NYSE: ACN) has appointed Vukani Mngxati country managing director for South Africa effective May 1, with responsibility for driving Accenture’s growth strategy in sub-Sahara Africa.\nMngxati will succeed William Mzimba who has been Accenture’s country managing director for South Africa since 2006 and with Accenture for 18 years.\nMngxati has served as managing director of Accenture’s Health & Public Service business for the past five years. He started his career with Accenture in 2000 after completing his studies, and made his way to senior manager level. In 2006, he left Accenture to pursue his personal interests as an entrepreneur. He returned to Accenture four years later with a deeper understanding of the African business landscape.\n“Vukani truly understands the local market and has been delivering real value and impact for our clients through innovative digital solutions, making him a great choice to lead our business in sub-Sahara Africa,” said Gianfranco Casati, Accenture’s group chief executive – Growth Markets. “As country managing director, Vukani will help clients streamline, transform and grow their businesses so they are future-ready.”\nAccenture has been operating in South Africa since 1971. The company serves a wide range of clients in the country, from state-owned entities to private enterprises and multinationals, through its offices in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Pretoria.\n“In our rapidly changing digital society, many companies are at risk of being left behind unless they embrace digital technology company-wide,” Mngxati said. “It is a journey that not only improves companies’ bottom lines, but is also a part of nation building, making this an incredibly exciting time to be able to help shape the future of Africa.”\nVukani holds a Bachelor of Commerce degree in Business Information Systems and Accounting from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.\nAbout Accenture\nAccenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions in strategy, consulting, digital, technology and operations.
