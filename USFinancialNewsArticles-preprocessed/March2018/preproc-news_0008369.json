    "text": "Published: Mar 5, 2018 8:32 a.m. ET Share \nNo. 4-ranked maker domestically looks to extend Western expansion as it plans a $10 billion IPO Reuters A customer looks at products at a Xiaomi shop in a shopping mall in Barcelona, Spain. \nBy Liza Lin Dan Strumpf \nChina’s Xiaomi Corp. could sell smartphones in the U.S. as early as this year, extending its Western expansion as it plans a highly anticipated initial public offering. \nBeijing-based Xiaomi, China’s fourth-largest smartphone vendor, has succeeded in emerging markets like India and Southeast Asia in recent years, and has also pushed into some Western markets, including Spain, where it opened stores earlier this year. \n“We’ve always been considering entering the U.S. market,” Xiaomi Chairman Lei Jun said at the sidelines of China’s annual legislative session in Beijing. “We plan to start entering the market by end 2018, or by early 2019.” \nBreaking into the U.S. market, where Xiaomi sells a number of internet-connected devices—like speakers, cameras and electronic scales—but doesn’t formally sell smartphones, would present a number of challenges, including the dominance of established brands like Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.69% and Samsung Electronics Co. SSNHZ, +0.00% The company would also need to form a partnership with a telecom carrier, the market’s gatekeepers. \nXiaomi could also be caught in a pushback against Chinese smartphone vendors in the U.S. Earlier this year, Huawei Technologies Co., lost out on a deal with AT&T Inc. T, +0.97% to sell its high-end Mate 10 phone there due to national security concerns—concerns Huawei has long said are misplaced.",
