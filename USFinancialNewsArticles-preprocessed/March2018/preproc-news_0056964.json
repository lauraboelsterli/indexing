    "text": "Company Reports Record Sales and Operating Profits – Online Revenue Increases Over 66%\nLAS VEGAS, NV, March 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Her Imports (OTCQB: HHER), a leading retailer of human hair extensions and related beauty products, today reported its financial results for the full year ended December 31, 2017. Revenue for the full year totaled $16.1 million with income from operations of $951,708.\nBarry Hall, Chief Executive Officer of Her Imports, stated, “In 2017, our focus was on profitability while growing our revenues. The overall retail environment has seen a major shift in customer buying habits and we responded by taking a hard look at every retail location to determine its long-term viability. As a result, we closed 13 locations during the year. However, this downsizing was achieved at a minimal cost due to our unique business model.” Hall added, “Additionally, we revised our marketing strategy away from traditional media and focused on new, mobile device specific platforms. This change increased online revenues to 35% of overall revenue, up from 25% in 2016.”\n2017 Business Highlights:\nLaunched a new eCommerce Website. Entered into an exclusive agreement with OSIworks to market and sell its line of hair care and beauty products. Formed a new Board of Directors along with an Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and a Governance and Nominating Committee. Entered into an agreement for a $500,000 credit facility for financing the purchase of inventory.\nFinancial Highlights for the Full Year 2017:\nRevenue totaled $16.1 million for the full year 2017, as compared to $13.6 million, an increase of 18.4%. While revenues from studio sales only increased 2.6%, online revenues were up 66.8%. Gross margin was 46.4% for the full year 2017, as compared with 42.8% for the full year 2016. The increase in gross margins, year-over-year, reflects an increase in accessory sales with high margins along with lower unit hair product costs. Income from operations was $951,708 in 2017 versus a loss from operations of $697,205 for the full year 2016. Net income attributable to the Company was $924,779 for the full year of 2017, compared with net loss of $1.8 million, for the full year 2016. In 2016, the Company had a one-time loss of $1.3 million on the termination of an agreement.\nAbout Her Imports:\nHer Imports sells human hair extensions and related hair-care and beauty products at retail locations throughout the U.S. and on our Website, www.herimports.com .
