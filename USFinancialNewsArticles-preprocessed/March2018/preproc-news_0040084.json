    "text": "0 COMMENTS New York Media, the publisher of New York Magazine and several websites, has acquired the comedy website Splitsider from The Awl Network in a bid to beef up its coverage of pop culture.\nThe Awl Network operated a group of four websites until earlier this year. In January, it closed The Hairpin , a general-interest site aimed at women, and The Awl , a site which hosted a wide range of essays and reporting, citing an inhospitable business climate for independent publishers.\nThe companies did not disclose financial terms of the transaction, which includes the Splitsider brand, its archives and social media accounts.\nSplitsider will be folded into New York Media’s pop culture website, Vulture , said Pam Wasserstein, chief executive of New York Media. The site’s archives will remain intact, and the Splitsider.com web address will redirect to a landing page on Vulture.com. Megh Wright, Splitsider’s only full-time employee, will join the staff at Vulture.\nThe addition is a natural fit for Vulture, a hub for TV, movies, music, comedy and other elements of pop culture. Vulture encompasses reviews, recaps, in-depth reporting, analysis and festivals in New York and Los Angeles that feature prominent figures in the entertainment industry.\nFor New York Media, the transaction is aimed at bolstering its coverage of comedy in an attempt to sell more advertising and drive more attendees and sponsors to Vulture’s live events, Ms. Wasserstein said. Advertising revenue at Vulture was up 22% in 2017 compared to the same time last year, according to a spokeswoman, who declined to provide a specific dollar amount.\nThe acquisition of Splitsider is partially aimed at making Vulture more attractive to marketers at Apple and Amazon, which are making big investments in original programming, Ms. Wasserstein said. She said the company has already had some success landing ad campaigns from over-the-top networks like Amazon, Netflix and Hulu.\n“We’re living through the golden age of television,” she said. “There’s a lot of content out there. How are people going to reach the audiences that will consume that content and be the influencers?”\nWith the acquisition of Splitsider, the only operational site in The Awl Network is the Billfold, a personal finance website aimed at millennials. The Awl Network, which was initially established in part to sell advertising across the company’s sites, will eventually dissolve and the Billfold will become its own independent entity, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
