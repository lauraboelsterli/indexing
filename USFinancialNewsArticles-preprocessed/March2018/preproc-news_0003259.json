    "text": "LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Puma Biotechnology, Inc. (NASDAQ: PBYI), a biopharmaceutical company, announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are for the fourth quarter and full year 2017, compared to the fourth quarter and full year 2016.\nOn July 17, 2017, Puma Biotechnology received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for NERLYNX® (neratinib) for the treatment of early stage HER2-positive breast cancer following adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy, and the Company began shipment to wholesalers at the end of July 2017. The Company reported net revenue from initial sales of NERLYNX of approximately $20.1 million in the fourth quarter and $26.2 million for the full year 2017.\nBased on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP), Puma reported a net loss applicable to common stock of $64.1 million, or $1.71 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a net loss of $72.7 million, or $2.04 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss applicable to common stock for the full year 2017 was $292.0 million, or $7.85 per share, compared to $276.0 million, or $8.29 per share, for the full year 2016.\nNon-GAAP adjusted net loss was $38.6 million, or $1.03 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to non-GAAP adjusted net loss of $43.4 million, or $1.22 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss for the full year 2017 was $183.3 million, or $4.93 per share, compared to non-GAAP adjusted net loss of $158.8 million, or $4.77 per share, for the full year 2016. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss excludes stock-based compensation expense, which represents a significant portion of overall expense and has no impact on the cash position of the Company. For a reconciliation of GAAP net loss to non-GAAP adjusted net loss and GAAP net loss per share to non-GAAP adjusted net loss per share, please see the financial tables at the end of this news release.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $35.6 million. Net cash used in operating activities for the full year 2017 was $172.5 million. At December 31, 2017, Puma had cash and cash equivalents of $81.7 million, compared to cash and cash equivalents of $194.5 million and marketable securities of $35.0 million at December 31, 2016. In November 2017, Puma announced that it entered into a loan agreement with Silicon Valley Bank and Oxford Finance for a term loan of up to $100 million, subject to funding in two tranches. Puma received gross proceeds of $50 million from the first tranche of the credit facility upon closing on October 31, 2017.\nDue to unanticipated delays by Puma surrounding certain disclosures related to tax and tax reform, Puma needs more time to complete its financial statements and to prepare its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. As a result, Puma is not in a position to file its Form 10-K within the prescribed time period without unreasonable expense and effort. Puma expects that its Form 10-K will be filed within the 15 day period specified by Rule 12b-25(b)(2)(ii) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.\n“With the FDA approval and successful launch of NERLYNX for extended adjuvant treatment of HER2-positive early stage breast cancer in the United States, 2017 was truly a milestone year for Puma Biotechnology,” said Alan H. Auerbach, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Puma. “Further, we presented results of our ongoing studies at major conferences, including our Phase III ExteNET study at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2017 Congress, our Phase II CONTROL study at the 2017 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, and our Phase II SUMMIT study at the 2017 American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting.”\nMr. Auerbach added, “During 2018, we anticipate the following key milestones for Puma: (i) submitting for a re-assessment of the Marketing Authorisation Application for neratinib by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the first quarter of 2018; (ii) reporting updated Phase I/II data from neratinib plus Kadcyla (T-DM1) in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer trial in the second quarter of 2018; (iii) reporting data from a Phase III trial in third-line metastatic breast cancer patients in the first half of 2018; (iv) submitting neratinib for regulatory approval for extended adjuvant HER-2 positive early stage breast cancer in certain markets outside of the United States in the second half of 2018; (v) reporting additional data from the Phase II CONTROL trial in the fourth quarter of 2018; and (vi) reporting Phase II data from the SUMMIT basket trial of neratinib in patients with HER2 mutations in the second half of 2018.”\nProduct Revenue\nNet revenue consists of sales of NERLYNX, Puma’s first and only commercial product to date. The FDA approved NERLYNX in July 2017 and the Company commenced shipment to wholesalers in late July. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, net revenue was approximately $20.1 million and $26.2 million, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were $85.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $72.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating expenses were $320.1 million for the full year 2017 compared to $276.6 million for the full year 2016.\nCost of Sales:\nCost of sales was $4.1 million for the fourth quarter and $5.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The Company had no product sales prior to the third quarter of 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $30.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to general and administrative expenses of $16.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Selling general and administrative expenses for the full year 2017 were $106.7 million, compared to general and administrative expenses of $53.8 million for the full year 2016. The increase of approximately $52.9 million during the full year 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 resulted primarily from increases of approximately $16.1 million for the hiring and training of our commercial sales force, $18.5 million in external costs for the commercial launch of NERLYNX, $7.3 million in legal expenses, $4.6 million in stock-based compensation, and approximately $5.0 million in other internal expenses, such as increased headcount, software and depreciation expenses.\nResearch and Development Expenses:\nResearch and development expenses were $50.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $56.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Research and development expenses for the full year 2017 were $207.8 million, compared to $222.8 million for the full year 2016. The decrease of approximately $15.0 million during the full year 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 resulted primarily from decreases of approximately $13.1 million in stock-based compensation and $6.8 million in manufacturing costs related to preparation of the commercial launch of NERLYNX, offset by increases of approximately $1.0 million in clinical study-related expense and $3.9 million in other internal expenses, such as increased headcount, travel and software.\nConference Call\nPuma Biotechnology will host a conference call to report its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results and provide an update on the company's business and outlook at 1:30 p.m. PST/4:30 p.m. EST on Thursday, March 1, 2018.

A replay of the call will be available approximately one hour after completion of the call and will be archived on the company's website for 90 days.\nAbout Puma Biotechnology\nPuma Biotechnology, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company with a focus on the development and commercialization of innovative products to enhance cancer care. The Company in-licenses the global development and commercialization rights to three drug candidates — PB272 (neratinib, oral), PB272 (neratinib, intravenous) and PB357. NERLYNX ® (neratinib, oral) is approved for commercial use by prescription in the United States as extended adjuvant therapy for early stage HER2-positive breast cancer following adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy and is marketed as NERLYNX. Neratinib is a potent irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks signal transduction through the epidermal growth factor receptors, HER1, HER2 and HER4. Currently, the Company is primarily focused on the commercialization of NERLYNX and the continued development of its other advanced drug candidates directed at the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.

The following table presents the Company’s net loss and net loss per share calculated in accordance with GAAP and as adjusted to remove the impact of employee stock-based compensation. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, stock-based compensation represented approximately 39.8% and 37.2% of net loss, respectively. Although net loss is important to measure financial performance, the Company currently places an emphasis on cash burn and, more specifically, cash used in operations. Stock-based compensation appears in GAAP net loss but is removed from net loss to arrive at cash used in operations on the statement of cash flows. Due to its noncash nature, the Company believes these non-GAAP measures enhance understanding of financial performance, are more indicative of operational performance and facilitate a better comparison among fiscal periods. These non-GAAP financial measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for GAAP reporting measures.\nPUMA BIOTECHNOLOGY, INC.
