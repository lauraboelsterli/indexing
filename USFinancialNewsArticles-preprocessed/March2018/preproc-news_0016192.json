    "text": "(Refiles to widen distribution)\nSEOUL, March 7 (Reuters) - South Korea’s women curlers, dubbed the “Garlic Girls” after their garlic-farming hometown, have become the faces of LG Electronics’ new cordless vacuum cleaners.\nThe women curlers were the breakout stars of last month’s Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, captivating home fans with their girl-next-door looks and cool-headedness, let alone their silver-medal performance.[\nThe women will now represent LG Electronics’ new cordless “CordZero” vacuum cleaners and its other home appliances, the company said in a statement.\n“We are glad to shoot a commercial with the women curling team who captured the world’s attention with their great ability and teamwork,” said Han Woong-hyun, vice president of LG Electronics.\nThe television commercial featuring the team would be aired in March, the company said.\nThe company also said it would sponsor the team over the next four years until they compete in the Beijing Winter Olympics in 2022.\nCurling was little known in South Korea’s before the women won their legions of fans and South Korea’s first-ever silver medal in the sport.\nFans showed their support for the team’s new deal by posting memes on social media and curling parody videos with floor mops and robot vacuum cleaners.
