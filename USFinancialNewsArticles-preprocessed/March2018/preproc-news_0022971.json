    "text": "Defenseman Seth Jones scored twice as the Columbus Blue Jackets posted a 3-2 victory over the visiting Detroit Red Wings on Friday at Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio.\nJones notched his second career two-goal game when he tallied twice in a span of 6 1/2 minutes in the second period.\nThe big night by Jones gave him 13 goals, surpassing his career high set last season.\nMatt Calvert also scored a shorthanded goal, as Columbus won its fourth straight game.\nThe Blue Jackets are on their first four-game winning streak since getting six straight wins in November and moved one point ahead of New Jersey for seventh place in the Eastern Conference with 77 points.\nSergei Bobrovsky made 22 saves after sitting out the previous two games with an illness. He allowed two goals or less for the ninth time in 11 games.\nDarren Helm and Andreas Athanasiou tallied for Detroit, which is 0-5-1 in its last six games. Backup goaltender Jared Coreau made 33 saves in his second appearance of the season.\nThe teams traded goals 21 seconds apart in an evenly-played opening period.\nCalvert finished off an odd-man rush by converting Alexander Wennberg’s pass from behind the net while stationed between the circles in the high slot. Wennberg faked a shot to get Coreau out of position, circled around the net and found Calvert, who easily one-timed the pass into the vacated net.\nAthanasiou scored with 3:43 remaining by putting a drive over Bobrovsky’s arm. The Red Wings peppered Bobrovsky in the final minute, but the game ended when he stopped Helm’s wrist shot with one second left.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
