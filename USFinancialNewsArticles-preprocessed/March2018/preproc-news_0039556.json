Investors buy and sell shares of the ALPS Equal Sector Weight ETF on a secondary market. Only market makers or “authorized participants” may trade directly with the Fund, typically in blocks of 50,000 shares.\nThe Fund’s investment performance, because it is an ETF of ETFS, depends on the investment performance of the Underlying Sector ETFs in which it invests. An investment in the Fund is subject to the risks associated with the Underlying Sector ETFs that comprise the Underlying Index. The Fund will indirectly pay a proportional share of the asset‐based fees of the Underlying Sector ETFs in which it invests.\nThe Fund is subject to the Underlying Sector ETFs Risks, making it subject to certain risks specific to each Underlying Sector ETF.
