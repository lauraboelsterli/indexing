    "text": "NEW YORK, March 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- WeissLaw LLP is investigating possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law by the Board of Directors of CommerceHub, Inc. (\"CommerceHub\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: CHUBA, CHUBK) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by funds affiliated with GTCR and Sycamore Partners (the \"Affiliates\"). Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the Company's shareholders will receive $22.75 in cash for each CommerceHub share they own.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether CommerceHub's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, the Company recently announced positive financial results. On February 28, 2018, it reported revenue of $36.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, representing an increase 12% year-over-year when compared to the $32.9 million reported in the same period of the previous year.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether CommerceHub's Board acted in the best interests of CommerceHub's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. If you own CommerceHub shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties. We have recovered over a billion dollars for defrauded clients and obtained important corporate governance relief in many of these cases. If you have information or would like legal advice concerning possible corporate wrongdoing (including insider trading, waste of corporate assets, accounting fraud, or materially misleading information), consumer fraud (including false advertising, defective products, or other deceptive business practices), or anti-trust violations, please email us at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com or fill out the form on our website, http://www.weisslawllp.com/commercehub-inc/\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/weisslaw-llp-investigates-commercehub-inc-acquisition-300612418.html\nSOURCE WeissLaw LLP",
