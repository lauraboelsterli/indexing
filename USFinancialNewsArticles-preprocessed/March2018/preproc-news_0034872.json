Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. KNX -0.42% is acquiring Abilene Motor Express, WSJ Logistics reports, in what looks to be one of the industry’s biggest deals since Knight-Swift itself was formed last year through the combination of the country’s two largest truckload operators. Abilene is a niche carrier but it brings the bigger operator a profitable business and 400 trucks when shippers are paying premium prices to find capacity on the road. That’s boosting carrier revenues just as trucking companies also are reaping big benefits from the new U.S. tax law, including Knight-Swift’s $364.2 million tax gain in its latest quarter, providing money for mergers. Knight-Swift CEO Dave Jackson says the company’s biggest challenge is finding people to put behind the wheel. Buying other companies may be the fastest way to get those drivers.\nThe Toys “R” Us Inc. plan to liquidate may end up costing vendors and suppliers many millions of dollars. Dozens of toy makers have shipped at least $450 million in products to the retailer since the company filed for bankruptcy protection , and the WSJ’s Lillian Rizzo reports they have yet to be paid. DHL Supply Chain was among the 50 largest listed creditors when Toys “R” Us filed for bankruptcy last fall, with nearly $3 million owed. DHL declined to comment on whether it has collected on any of its bills or whether it is still moving goods as the retailer liquidates. “We are continuing to liaise closely with our customer but it is too early to comment,” a spokesperson said. Toys “R” Us still hopes to sell 200 of its best-performing stores, but after a miserable holiday sales period, questions about its inventory and any revenue it can generate may be tied up in court.\nTesla Inc. is reaching a make-or-break point in getting its automotive supply chain up to speed. The Silicon Valley electric-car pioneer is set to disclose next month whether it is on track to meet an ambitious second-quarter production target for its mass-market Model 3 sedan. The WSJ’s Tim Higgins and Susan Pulliam report that achieving the goal of 5,000 cars a week is crucial to generating enough cash to sustain operations without having to raise more capital. It may prove challenging to find backing from an increasingly impatient investor community that has seen Tesla stumble as it has sought to compete with mainstream auto makers and their extensive global supply chains. Pushing out more Model 3s would answer concerns over Tesla’s cash flow, and provide enough working capital to push along its Tesla Semi, the heavy-duty truck that’s gained plenty of reservations based on promises of new production.\nSUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES Photo: Bloomberg News Blue Apron Holdings Inc. is looking for an easier and more profitable distribution channel to its customers. The meal-kit pioneer will try to boost its struggling business by selling meal kits in stores, the WSJ’s Heather Haddon reports, in what looks like an overhaul of a business model that has been built on the difficult logistics of getting ready-to-cook meals to customers’ doors on a daily basis. Blue Apron’s subscription service is part of an intensifying fight by startups and standing companies to reach people’s dinner tables. The company faces heavy supply-chain costs and has been weighed down by high customer turnover, with high prices and distribution problems turning off users. Delivering to grocery stores is much easier, of course, and it may help stave off competition from the chains themselves. Many supermarkets are developing their own consumer-delivery networks, and meal-kits may not be too far behind.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ Sourcing and retaining drivers remains a top priority across our fleets. ’\n—Dave Jackson, CEO of Knight-Swift Transportation, in the carrier’s recent earnings report.\nNumber of the Day 69.1% Share of U.S.-Mexico freight flows by value carried by trucks in 2017, a decline of 1.9 percentage points from the year before, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics.\nIN OTHER NEWS Overall U.S. industrial production rose 1.1% last month and manufacturing output grew at a faster pace .
