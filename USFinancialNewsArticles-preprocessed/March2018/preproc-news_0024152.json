    "text": "Getty Images Tim Cook \nApple closed at an all-time high Monday, briefly surpassing an intraday market cap of $925 billion for the first time. \nShares closed at $181.40 — less than a percent up — but climbed above $182 in midday trading, briefly pushing the tech giant to a market cap of $925.4 billion, before closing at $922 billion. \nThat puts Apple more than $100 billion ahead of the second-largest company by market capitalization, Alphabet , and more than $150 billion ahead of Amazon . \nApple earlier Monday announced it was buying magazine subscription service Texture , and company SVP Eddy Cue said at SXSW that a Netflix or Disney tie-up was unlikely. \n--CNBC's Steve Kopack contributed to this report.",
