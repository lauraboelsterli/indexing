It has also increased its focus on organic and fresh food products.\nIn Brazil, where Casino controls retailer Grupo Pao de Acucar (GPA), the group’s performance was helped by the success of a cash-and-carry format.\nCasino shares, which rose 10.9 percent in 2017, have fallen around nearly 20 percent so far in 2018, underperforming their European sector.\n$1 = 0.8060 euros Reporting by Dominique Vidalon; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta and Elaine Hardcastle\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
