Because it's too inexpensive, but they've got to tell the story and they're not any good at doing it.\"\nAdvanced Micro Devices : \"I feel good about its PC exposure. I feel good about its graphics chips. The problem is this: they're up against Intel and they're up against Nvidia , so it's always going to be a tough time for [CEO] Dr. Lisa Su, but she'll get through it.\"\nDexcom Inc. : \"I think it's going to get taken over. I mean, I've got to tell you, we own Abbott Labs for ActionAlertsPlus.com, but I was quite impressed that Dexcom got that faster approval. It's going to be hard for that company to stay independent.\"\nPayPal : \"I will say this about PayPal: club members of ActionAlertsPlus.com know that we bought this aggressively this week. Why not? It's finally come down. [CEO] Dan Schulman told a great story.\"\nWatch the full lightning round here: show chapters Cramer's lightning round: CVS' management is no good at telling their story 15 Hours Ago | 03:38 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Nvidia, Abbott Laboratories and PayPal.\n ",
