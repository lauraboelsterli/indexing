    "text": "VARNA, Bulgaria (Reuters) - European Union leaders on Monday said they received no concrete answers from Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to a long list of concerns including Turkey’s operation in Syria to the jailing of journalists.\n“We didn’t achieve any kind of concrete compromise today,” European Council President Donald Tusk told reporters after talks with Erdogan in the Bulgarian costal town of Varna.\n“But I still hope that will be possible in the future... Only progress on these issues will allow us to improve the EU-Turkey relations, including the accession process.”\nReporting by Alissa de Carbonnel @AdeCar; Editing by Gabriela Baczynska\n ",
