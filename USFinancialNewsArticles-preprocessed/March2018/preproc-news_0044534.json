    "text": "TSX and NASDAQ: MPVD\nTORONTO and NEW YORK, March 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Mountain Province Diamonds Inc. (\"Mountain Province\", or the \"Company\") (TSX and NASDAQ: MPVD) today announces its financial and operating results for the full year ended December 31, 2017. All figures are expressed in Canadian dollars unless otherwise noted.\nHighlights\nCommercial production at the Gahcho Ku√© Diamond Mine (\"GK Mine\") declared on March 1, 2017. Earnings from mining operations recorded commencing in June, on commencement of the sale of diamonds produced subsequent to start of commercial production.\nEarnings from mine operations of $52.1 million, and net income of $17.2 million or $0.11 per share. Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $56.6 million for the second half of 2017 (the third quarter of 2017 was the first full quarter of reported earnings from mine operations following the start of commercial production).\nTotal sales of $238 million (US$185 million) in 2017, of which $68 million was capitalized as pre-commercial production revenue and $170 million (US$134 million) is reported as sales in the statement of comprehensive income. Average full-year realization of US$70 per carat ($89 Canadian dollar equivalent per carat).\nApproximately 2,775,000 tonnes of ore treated through the process plant and 5,934,000 carats recovered, on a 100% basis, for an average recovered grade of 2.14 carats per tonne (\"cpt\"). This recovered grade is approximately 32% above the original budget for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCash costs of production, including capitalized stripping costs 1 , for the full year ended December 31, 2017 of $73 per tonne and $33 per carat recovered. Cash costs of production, including capitalized stripping costs 1 , for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $62 per tonne and $26 per carat recovered.\nStrong participation at the Company's tender sales, with participation rates increasing through 2017. An average of eleven bids per lot received in 2017, with individual tenders offering approximately 125 lots per sale and over 100 companies bidding each sale.\nCompleted an offering of US$330 million in senior secured second lien notes in December 2017, the proceeds from which were used to fully retire the Company's project lending facility and pay out historical sunk cost amounts owing to De Beers Canada Inc. (\"De Beers\").\nYear end cash position of $43.1 million and net working capital of $96.8 million, with US$50 million revolving credit facility remaining undrawn.\n1\nCash costs of production, including capitalized stripping costs, and adjusted EBITDA are non-IFRS measures with no standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS. See the Non-IFRS Measures section of the Company's December 31, 2017 MD&A for explanation and reconciliation.\nMountain Province Interim President and CEO David Whittle commented, \"2017 was a milestone year for Mountain Province as we transitioned from development into commercial production. Over the second half of 2017, which covers our first two full quarters of reported mine operating results, we saw an adjusted EBITDA figure of $56.6 million, underscoring the cash flow generating capabilities of the GK mine. For 2018, production is expected to increase from 2017 to between 6.3 and 6.6 million carats recovered at an average grade of 2.02 to 2.12 carats per tonne. This has all been achieved with a commendable safety record at site, and I congratulate the entire De Beers operating team at the GK mine for what they've accomplished. The 2018 year has seen a strong start in rough diamond markets. The first two sales of the year substantially exceeded expectations, and prices have firmed across all product categories since the second half of 2017. We look forward to a year of strengthening fundamentals in the diamond industry.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nYear ended\nYear ended\n(in millions of Canadian dollars, except where otherwise noted)\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nSales\n$\n170,108\n-\nCarats sold*\n000's carats\n1,986\n-\nAverage price per carat sold\n$/carat\n86\n-\nCost of sales per carat**\n$/carat\n59\n-\nEarnings from mine operations per carat\n$\n26\n-\nEarnings from mine operations\n%\n31%\n-\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n15,593\n6,277\nOperating income (loss)\n$\n36,068\n(6,277)\nNet income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss)\n$\n17,152\n4,798\nBasic and diluted earnings (loss) per share\n$\n0.11\n0.03\n* Carats sold relates to diamonds recovered and sold after declaration of commercial production and reported in the statement of comprehensive income.\n** This cost of sales per carat includes the cost of acquiring 51% of the fancies and specials which have been sold, after having been won in a tendering process with De Beers.\nThe Company undertook ten tender sales of diamonds during the year ended December 31, 2017 through its broker in Antwerp, Belgium. Although the GK mine declared commercial production on March 1, 2017, the first four sales have been recorded against mine construction costs rather than as revenue on the Company's statement of comprehensive income, as those diamonds sold were all recovered prior to the mine declaring commercial production.\nIn December 2017, the Company completed an offering of US$330 million in senior secured second lien notes in December 2017, the proceeds from which were used to fully retire its project lending facility. Financing costs in the fourth quarter of 2017 accordingly include a one-time non-cash charge of $15.5 million to expense deferred financing charges associated with that project lending facility.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had cash totaling $43.1 million and net working capital of $96.8 million. The Company's US$50 million revolving credit facility remains undrawn.\nGK Mine Operations\nThe following table summarizes key operating statistics for the GK mine in 2017.

In the third quarter of 2017, the Company reported that the review conducted in 2017 identified three main areas of update to the operating plans for 2018 and subsequent years.\nBased on realized and sustained plant throughput rates in 2017 and confirmatory engineering assessments, the nameplate capacity of the plant is being increased as of 2018 by 5% to 3,150,000 tonnes per annum.\nRecovered diamond grade has exceeded plan, and that overperformance is projected to continue.\nA layback of the planned east wall of the 5034 open pit was required for geotechnical reasons, and the mine plan will therefore reflect additional waste removal due to increased stripping requirements.\nA summary of key parameters from the updated operational plan over the next five years is provided as follows (100% basis):\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\nOre tonnes processed\n000s\n3,115\n3,153\n3,161\n3,153\n3,153\nCarats recovered\n000s\n6,300 - 6,600\n6,000 - 6,300\n6,300 - 6,600\n5,700 - 6,000\n5,300 - 5,600\nCash costs of production per tonne, net of capitalized stripping\n$\n76\n82\n76\n74\n81\nCash costs of production per tonne, including capitalized stripping\n$\n96\n99\n100\n100\n103\nSustaining capital expeditures\n$000s\n54,629\n31,497\n12,669\n9,070\n7,355\nThe five year production outlook provided in the above table is in line with the guidance previously provided in the third quarter, with minor exceptions to the operating and sustaining capital cost estimates shown here. For 2018, cash costs of production per tonne, net of capitalized stripping, have been revised to $76 from $77, and cash costs of production per tonne, including capitalized stripping, have been revised to $96 from $100. Sustaining capital expenditures have been revised to $54.6 million from $46.6 million. The operational plan for 2018 anticipates total ore processing of approximately 3,115,000 tonnes, recovering between 6.3 million and 6.6 million carats (100% basis) and reflecting a recovered grade of between 2.02 cpt and 2.12 cpt.\nNot included in the updated operational plan is any potential processing of diamondiferous kimberlite from the Southwest Corridor, between the 5034 and Hearne pipes. Much of the Southwest Corridor is already scheduled under the mine plan to be mined as waste rock, and in the course of stripping activity to date, this area has been recognized as containing diamondiferous kimberlite that is not included in the current project resource or reserve statements. An exploration program is being carried out in the area of the Southwest Corridor to consider whether resource identification may be validated, with results anticipated in 2018. Also not included in the updated operational plan is any potential grade increase associated with the West lobe of the 5034 pipe. Evaluations are being conducted on the West lobe to better isolate and assess its grade performance, the outcomes of which are anticipated in 2018 and may justify further revision to production estimates. Additionally, while the increased waste removal attributed to the push back of the 5034 east wall is projected in the operational plan to persist through the full planned extent of the pit, there may be future opportunities to reduce the impact depending on actual operational conditions encountered during 2018.\nConference Call\nFull details of the financial and operating results for the year ended December 31, 2017 are described in Mountain Province's audited consolidated financial statements with accompanying notes and related Management's Discussion and Analysis.
