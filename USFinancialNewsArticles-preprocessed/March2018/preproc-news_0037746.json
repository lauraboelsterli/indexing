    "text": "SAINT LAURENT, Quebec, IntelGenx Technologies Corp. (TSXV:IGX) (OTCQX:IGXT) (the “ Company ” or “ IntelGenx ”) is pleased to announce that IntelGenx Corp., the Company’s operating subsidiary, has entered into an agreement to acquire pharmaceutical consulting firm Laboval Inc. (“ Laboval ”) for total cash consideration of up to CA$5 million (the “ Acquisition ”), subject to the acquired business achieving certain revenue milestones over the two years following closing.\nThe Company intends to finance the Acquisition and related fees and costs by way of private placement equity financing, the terms of which the Company intends to establish in the coming days (the “ Offering ”). IntelGenx Corp.’s obligation to close the Acquisition is conditional upon the Company raising at least US$10 million under the Offering. Proceeds raised in addition to those required for the Acquisition would be used to finance the Company’s Montelukast Phase 2b clinical trial as well as working capital.\nLaboval, based in Montreal, Quebec, is engaged in the business of pharmaceutical product testing, offering a comprehensive range of quality control testing for finished products and raw materials, as well as in-process testing, stability studies, forced degradation and regulatory services to the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, natural health, cosmetics and healthcare sectors. Laboval holds all necessary licenses and approvals of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada to carry on its business.\n“Laboval has long been a trusted partner of IntelGenx, providing us with all GMP compliant testing services required to release commercial product to the market, as well as analytical development services needed for our product development activities,” said Horst G. Zerbe, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “This strategic acquisition serves two primary purposes. First, it reduces IntelGenx’ overall cost structure by bringing quality control testing in-house. In addition, it provides us with additional sources of revenue as the business continues to serve other pharmaceutical companies.”\nUnder the purchase agreement, approximately 40% of the purchase price will be paid by the Company as of the closing date. Additional consideration in the form of an earn-out of up to 60% of the purchase price will be payable over the two-year post-closing period, based on the achievement of certain revenue objectives for the acquired business.\nThe closing of the Acquisition is expected to occur on or about March 30, 2018 and is subject to the Company raising at least US$10 million under the Offering and certain other customary closing conditions, including the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy, securities in any jurisdiction where not permitted by law.
