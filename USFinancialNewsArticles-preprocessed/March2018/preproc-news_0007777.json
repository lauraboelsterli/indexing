    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron has congratulated German Chancellor Angela Merkel and acting SPD leader Olaf Scholz after Germany’s Social Democrats voted in favor of forming a new coalition, the French presidency said on Sunday.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel arrive at a European Union heads of state informal meeting in Brussels, Belgium, February 23, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir “It’s good news for Europe,” Macron’s office said.\n“France and Germany will work together on new initiatives in the coming weeks to bring the European project forward,” the President’s office said in a statement.\nMembers of the SPD voted in favor of a coalition with Merkel’s conservatives on Sunday, opening the way to a new government for Europe’s largest economy.\nMacron’s ambitious reform plans for further integration of the euro zone had been put on hold for months by the absence of a new government in Germany.\nReporting by Michel Rose; Editing by Keith Weir and Alexander Smith\n ",
