To me, it's always been the perfect city for our next Virgin Hotel,\" said Virgin Hotels CEO Raul Leal. \"We are dedicated to delivering the best in design, entertainment, heartfelt service and culinary excellence and we can't wait to welcome visitors to what is sure to be an awe-inspiring Las Vegas experience.\"\nFengate is managing its investment on behalf of the Laborers' International Union of North America's (LiUNA) Central and Eastern Canada Pension Fund. \"LiUNA is pleased with our strong working team behind this strategic investment, and we are very proud that the highly-skilled brothers and sisters of LiUNA will be a part of building this extraordinary new Virgin Hotels in Las Vegas,\" said Joseph Mancinelli, LiUNA International Vice President and Regional Manager for Central and Eastern Canada.\nLocated just off the famous Las Vegas Strip, Virgin Hotels Las Vegas will be a destination for locals and guests alike, offering premier food, beverage, and entertainment experiences.\nTo learn more about Virgin Hotels Las Vegas and other future developments, please visit https://development.virginhotels.com/ .\nAbout Virgin Hotels:\nVirgin Hotels is a lifestyle hospitality brand that combines heartfelt service, straightforward value and a seamless, personalized hotel experience with the track record of innovation and smart disruption that Sir Richard Branson's global Virgin Group has pioneered for over 40 years.
