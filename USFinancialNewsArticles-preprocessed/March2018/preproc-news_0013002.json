Clinics and Hospitals in some 45 countries are now effectively using the DRX9000 ™ and there are more than 2,400 systems in use worldwide,\" he added.\nResearch conducted by physicians from leading medical schools and research institutions, including the Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins University, Stanford, and University of California, San Francisco , demonstrated that DRX® treatment is more than 88 percent effective treating patients with chronic lower back pain. Their results were published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Medicine.\nMusallam founded Excite Medical in 2007 and since that time has been growing its customer base and support services around its flagship product, the DRX9000™ non-surgical spinal decompression system.
