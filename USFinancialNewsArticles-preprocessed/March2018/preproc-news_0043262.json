Larocca as chief executive officer to oversee the strategic direction of both firms. Larocca, who has held executive and senior sales positions in an array of technology and services companies, is an innovative executive with leadership expertise in driving organic growth.\nLarocca's appointment comes at a time when the companies are seeing rapidly growing demand for their lighting products. Luminance provides a large line of stock lighting solutions , fixtures and hardware to residential and commercial clients while its sister company, Hallmark Lighting, supplies customized, high-end lighting solutions , primarily to the hospitality industry, including 98 percent of four- and five-star hotels. The companies are known for their unparalleled quality and world-class service.\n\"I am pleased that Chris Larocca has joined the team. He has revitalized companies through his experience in leading sales growth and his innovative approach to strategically focusing on key business lines,\" said Ron Cozean, executive chairman of both Luminance and Hallmark Lighting and an operating executive at Resilience Capital Partners , which owns Luminance and Hallmark Lighting. \"Chris will help Luminance and Hallmark Lighting stay competitive in the fast-evolving lighting marketplace.\"\nSince 2013, Larocca has served as president of Dover Corporation (NYSE: DOV), a publicly traded company that manufactures and sells a range of equipment and components, specialty systems and support services. He also has led OK International, a Dover company with operations in industrial soldering, fluid dispensing, additive manufacturing (3D printing) and production software.\nPreviously, Larocca held several senior positions, culminating in his role as chief operating officer, at EMCORE Corp., a publicly held international manufacturer of compound semiconductor-based components and subsystems for the fiber optic, military/defense and aerospace solar power markets.\nEarlier, Larocca served as Vice President â€“ Signals at GELcore LLC, a solid state lighting joint venture of EMCORE and General Electric that developed light-emitting diodes (LED) and systems for the specialty and general illumination markets. Larocca began his career with the lighting products division of General Electric.\nLarocca holds a B.S. degree in civil engineering from Clemson University and an MBA degree from the University of Southern California.\n\"Hallmark Lighting and Luminance have built their reputations as industry leaders by deploying technology to provide quality lighting solutions. Chris has the ability to help the companies more effectively engage with their residential clients, as well as clients in the hotel and retail spaces, and we look forward to his leadership,\" said Cozean.\nSince Cleveland-based private equity firm Resilience Capital Partners acquired Luminance and Hallmark Lighting in 2016, the companies have benefited from substantial investments in product development and operations.\nRecently, Hallmark Lighting announced that its founder returned as president . The company also invested in the hiring of new sales executives and the launch of additional new products, as well as the expansion of marketing and distribution to better reach and engage with lighting design and purchase firms seeking state-of-the-art quality and product innovation.\nHallmark Lighting also recently launched the new Lumin Collection , which offers stock products that provide an affordable, yet sophisticated, look for clients in the two- and three-star hospitality industry and elsewhere as a dramatic alternative to the bespoke products that Hallmark Lighting has long been known for offering.\nEarlier, Hallmark Lighting launched a significantly enhanced website ( www.hallmarklighting.com ) to serve its many clients, including top designers and procurement firms, who go online for ideas and to source lighting solutions.\nAbout Luminance\nCommerce, California-headquartered Luminance is a designer and distributor of lighting solutions, fixtures, hardware and electrical components, ceiling fans, plumbing parts, light bulbs and LED bulbs.
