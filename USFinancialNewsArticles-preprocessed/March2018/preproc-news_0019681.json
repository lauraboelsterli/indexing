What’s going to happen hasn’t been defined yet. It makes investors less worried than they would be if this tariff was applied to every industry and every country,” Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.02-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.90-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nThe S&P 500 posted 12 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 136 new highs and 18 new lows.
