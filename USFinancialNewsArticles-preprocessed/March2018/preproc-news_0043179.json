    "text": "MENLO PARK, Calif. and HELSINKI, Finland, March 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MariaDB® Corporation , the company behind the fastest growing open source database, today announced that it has acquired enterprise analytics database company MammothDB for an undisclosed sum. Through the acquisition, MariaDB expands its European presence with a new office in Sofia, Bulgaria, and grows its global engineering and consulting talent to further strengthen its modern analytics solution, MariaDB AX , and advance its larger Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) strategy.\nTweet this : #MariaDB acquires @MammothDB, adding deep #analytics expertise and growing its global presence with new office in Bulgaria. http://ow.ly/BEWp30j5Emq\n“The MammothDB team joins MariaDB at a critical point in our growth, bringing with them an impressive track record of delivering big data solutions,” said Michael Howard, CEO of MariaDB Corporation. “Over the past year, we’ve seen a major increase in demand for MariaDB AX as organizations seek to fill an open source analytics gap left by proprietary offerings such as Oracle and Teradata. The addition of MammothDB’s deep analytics expertise will be invaluable to helping MariaDB meet this growing need and continue to innovate our analytic products.”\nMariaDB AX, first released in 2017, provides modern analytics and data warehousing that scales with existing commodity hardware on premises or across any public, private or hybrid cloud platform, unrestricted from cloud vendor lock-in. Expanding beyond the highly successful transactional solution MariaDB TX, MariaDB AX enables high-performance analytics with distributed storage and parallel processing, transforming data across every facet of business into meaningful and actionable results. With the addition of MammothDB’s deep bench of engineering talent, MariaDB will continue enhancing the MariaDB AX offering while providing optimized implementations for its analytic customers across every industry.\n“We see great synergy between our mission and MariaDB’s goal of delivering innovative, enterprise-grade database solutions at a fraction of the cost of other options in the market,” said Steve Keil, former CEO of MammothDB. “MammothDB was founded to help organizations that were tired of using 80 percent of their IT budget on licensing and hardware costs from companies like Oracle and Teradata. We’re thrilled to join forces with MariaDB to continue furthering that goal and to help bring even more powerful analytic offerings to the global open source community.”\nThe acquisition comes on the heels of MariaDB’s recent momentum, including an investment from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and Alibaba Group totaling $54 million, and a massive global user conference with keynotes from customers Development Bank of Singapore (DBS Bank) and ServiceNow. With the new office in Sofia, Bulgaria, MariaDB will be able to continue expanding its European presence, accelerate product delivery and better support its growing global community.\nAdditional Resources\nEIB supports MariaDB with financing for accelerated growth Blog: MariaDB AX for Analytics: Out With The Old, In With The New MariaDB AX Datasheet Visit mariadb.com Follow @mariadb on Twitter Read MariaDB’s blog\nAbout MariaDB Corporation\nMariaDB Corporation is the company behind MariaDB, the fastest growing open source database.
