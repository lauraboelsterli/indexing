    "text": "1 COMMENTS Much to the consternation of most mainland Chinese investors, the nation’s most successful internet companies are listed abroad, out of reach of many. A new plan would smooth their entry back home, but might also inspire a speculative fever in their shares.\nChina’s regulators are considering allowing the country’s largest technology companies to list on mainland stock exchanges via a structure called Chinese Depository Receipts, or CDRs, which allow investors to own shares of those firms indirectly, according to local media outlet Caixin. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that authorities have asked smartphone maker Xiaomi, which is planning an IPO to raise $10 billion, to go public in the mainland, as well as Hong Kong .\nThe Shanghai Stock Exchange. China’s regulators are considering allowing the nation’s tech giants to list on mainland stock exchanges. Photo: Featurechina/Ropi/Zuma Press The government has been eager to bring these cherished household names back to the country. Foreigners have reaped billions in upside from China’s internet giant. Beijing would rather keep those profits at home. Alibaba and Tencent, the country’s two largest firms with a combined market value of nearly $1 trillion, are listed in New York and Hong Kong respectively.\nThe CDR structure would overcome some obstacles. First, most of these firms have a dual-class share structure, which isn’t allowed in a direct mainland listing. Second, these companies have typically used a convoluted corporate structure called variable interest entity, or VIE , to allow foreign investors to invest in sectors that are restricted by the Chinese government. Under current regulations, these firms would need to delist from foreign exchanges and unwind that structure before they can directly list on the mainland — a process that takes years.\nOne risk, though clearly one that companies might like taking, is that mainland investors would be willing to own these names at much higher valuations than offshore investors. Internet security firm Qihoo 360, for example, has a market value at $55 billion after its debut in Shanghai through a backdoor listing last week. The company was delisted from New York at a mere valuation of $9 billion in 2016.\nWith CDRs, however, the original listing onshore would remain, and because the two shares wouldn’t be fungible, the offshore listing would trade at a lower valuation. It will be the offshore investors who will suddenly feel like they are missing out. \nWrite to Jacky Wong at JACKY.WONG@wsj.com",
