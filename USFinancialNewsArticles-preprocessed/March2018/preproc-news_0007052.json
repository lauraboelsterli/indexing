The facility is strategically positioned to support the planned construction of several petrochemical and LNG projects anticipated along the U.S. Gulf Coast. The asset is currently under contract with a large petrochemical company, providing contracted revenue visibility through mid-2019.\nUnder the terms of the purchase agreement, total consideration for the transaction is $28 million, composed of $23.5 million of cash and $4.5 million of Civeo common equity issued to the seller. The agreement also includes an earnout up to $4 million of Civeo common equity (based on current market prices) dependent on further contracted revenues through December 2020. For the ten months remaining in 2018, the facility is expected to generate approximately $7 million in revenue and $6 million in gross profit.\nBradley J. Dodson, Civeo’s President and Chief Executive Officer, commented “This acquisition strengthens our presence in the U.S. by diversifying our end market exposure to the downstream sector in the Gulf Coast. Similar to our previously announced Noralta acquisition, this acquisition provides additional topline visibility through an established customer contract.”\nThe acquisition includes the 400 room facility on 40 acres providing the necessary room for expansion, if needed. The facility is currently over 90% occupied.\nAbout Civeo\nCiveo Corporation is a leading provider of workforce accommodations with prominent market positions in the Canadian oil sands and the Australian natural resource regions.
