    "text": "PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haiti’s president on Tuesday installed a seven-member high command for the new army, pledging that the force due to have 5,000 soldiers will help the impoverished Caribbean nation recover from natural disasters and rebuild infrastructure.\nHaitian President Jovenel Moise and Chief of the army's high command Jodel Lessage during a meeting at the Defence Ministry during the establishment of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Haitian Armed Forces (FAD'H) in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, March 27, 2018. REUTERS/Andres Martinez Casares The country’s army was disbanded in 1995 by then-president Jean-Bertrand Aristide after he returned to power following a coup, leaving the national police responsible for security.\nThe military’s return has been a divisive topic in a country still suffering from a catastrophic earthquake and a fierce hurricane in recent years. Critics express concern the armed forces would meddle in politics and plunder vital resources.\nHaitian President Jovenel Moise (C), Prime Minister Jack Guy Lafontant and Chief of the army's high command Jodel Lessage during a ceremony to establish the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Haitian Armed Forces (FAD'H) in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, March 27, 2018.

He declined to name the countries.\nInitially, authorities plan to recruit 500 soldiers for the armed forces, officials say.\nEditing by Richard Borsuk\n ",
