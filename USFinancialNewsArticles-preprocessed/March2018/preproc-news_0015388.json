These measurements are not recognized in accordance\nwith GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance.\nEBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as\nEBITDA before unrealized losses (gains) on derivative contracts and stock-based compensation expense. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are presented because we believe they provide additional useful information to investors due to the various noncash items during the period. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures, or\ncontractual commitments;\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt or cash income tax payments; Although depreciation and amortization are noncash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and Other companies in this industry may calculate EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA differently than Vertex Energy does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nVERTEX ENERGY, INC.
