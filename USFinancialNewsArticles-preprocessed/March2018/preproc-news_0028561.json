File photo of the skyline of the banking district in Frankfurt, September 18, 2014. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach /Files Men earned on average 21.00 euros (£18.63) an hour in 2017, compared with 16.59 euros for women, the Office said. In 2007, the gap was 23 percent. It said the difference was explained partly by where men and women tend to work. Other factors were fewer women being bosses and more women than men holding part-time jobs, it said. A so-called “adjusted” gender pay gap for men and women in comparable jobs and with comparable qualifications was about 6 percent. The overall gap is roughly three times as big in western Germany, at 22 percent, as it is in the former Communist East, where it is 7 percent. Reporting by Madeline Chambers, editing by Larry King",
