    "text": "CyberArk to Dramatically Simplify the User Experience for Privileged Business Users and Cloud Administrators While Extending Proactive Security Controls\nNEWTON, Mass. & PETACH TIKVA, Israel--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CyberArk (NASDAQ: CYBR ), the global leader in privileged account security , today announced the acquisition of certain assets of privately-held Vaultive, Inc., a cloud security provider. The deal closed today.\nThe CyberArk Privileged Account Security Solution is the industry’s most comprehensive solution for protecting against privileged account exploitation anywhere – on-premises, in hybrid cloud environments and across DevOps workflows. Building upon the Vaultive technology, CyberArk will deliver greater visibility and control over privileged business users, and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) administrators. By delivering a cloud-native and mobile experience, Vaultive will extend the CyberArk solution to these highly privileged users, which are frequent targets for cyber attacks.\n“The Vaultive team brings innovative technology and advanced cloud industry experience to CyberArk. We look forward to incorporating the technology to add additional depth and proactive protection for enterprises facing an expanding attack surface in the cloud,” said Udi Mokady, chairman and CEO, CyberArk. “Vaultive provides a strong building block to accelerate CyberArk’s cloud security strategy, making CyberArk the only vendor able to extend privileged account security to administrators and privileged business users in cloud environments with this level of granularity and control.”\nAccording to IDC, worldwide spending on public cloud services and infrastructure is forecast to reach $277 billion in 2021. 1 Privileged business users and SaaS, IaaS and PaaS administrators have broad and often unlimited access to a range of social media, web-based sales operations and financial applications. That access must be monitored and controlled consistently across multiple types of applications, and be done in a way that doesn’t change the way cloud administrators and privileged business users work.\n“I'm extremely proud of everything that the Vaultive team accomplished,\" said Ben Matzkel, founder and CTO, Vaultive. \"It's becoming increasingly clear that customers desire a unified security approach that extends from the data center to the cloud. Fortified with Vaultive's technology and its team, CyberArk is uniquely positioned to meet this critical need. We look forward to working closely with CyberArk customers around the world to advance their privileged account security strategies for the cloud.”\nThis acquisition furthers CyberArk’s leadership in securing modern infrastructure and applications. Using CyberArk Conjur, organizations gain a comprehensive secrets management solution for DevOps toolchains and cloud-native applications. Additionally, CyberArk offers cloud platform support across AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and has validated the ability to stand up a privileged account security solution in AWS in 15 minutes or less . With the acquisition of Vaultive, CyberArk extends its leadership to secure privileged access to SaaS, IaaS and PaaS applications by administrators and privileged business users.\n1 – IDC Press Release, Worldwide Public Cloud Services Spending Forecast to reach $160 Billion this year, According to IDC, January 2018\nAbout CyberArk\nCyberArk (NASDAQ: CYBR ) is the global leader in privileged account security, a critical layer of IT security to protect data, infrastructure and assets across the enterprise, in the cloud and throughout the DevOps pipeline.
