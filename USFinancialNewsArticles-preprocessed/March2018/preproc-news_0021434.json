(“iPic” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:IPIC), America’s premier luxury restaurant-and-theater brand, today announced its initial full year 2018 outlook, including expectations for annual comparable-store sales growth of 0% to +5%, and articulated four key strategic initiatives to create long-term value for stockholders. The Company also reported its third quarter 2017 results, expects to file its 10-Q shortly, as well as reported preliminary, unaudited full year 2017 results.\nHamid Hashemi, Founder & Chief Executive Officer of iPic ® Entertainment, commented, “With the completion of our Initial Public Offering in February, we are excited to begin our journey as a public company. iPic ® Entertainment is America’s premier luxury restaurant-and-theater brand that strives to be our guest’s favorite local destination for a night out on the town. Our concept is well-positioned within today’s ever-increasing experiential economy to deliver a one-of-a-kind, four-hour guest experience.”\nHashemi continued, “We currently operate 115 screens at 15 locations in 9 states with the goal of reaching 200 locations across the US. We believe that we are still in the very nascent stage of our domestic growth story but also see significant opportunity to expand internationally. We are laser focused on executing on our four key strategic initiatives to meaningfully improve our top and bottom-line performance in 2018 and beyond while creating long-term value for our stockholders.”\nInitial Full Year 2018 Financial Outlook\nFor the year ending December 31, 2018, the Company currently expects the following:\nTotal revenue growth of +3% to +7%. Comparable-store sales growth in the range of 0% to +5%. Store-level EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, growth of +20% to +30%. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, loss of $(1.5) million to $(0.5) million. At least three remodels of existing locations with Generation I auditoriums. Capital expenditures of $20 million to $25 million, net of tenant improvement dollars.\nKey Strategic Initiatives\niPic plans to execute on four key strategic initiatives in order to meaningfully improve its top and bottom-line results over time and create long-term value for stockholders.\n1. Improving Profitability from Existing Locations :\nA significant revenue driver going forward will be the remodeling of the Company’s Generation I legacy locations into Generation III designs that, among other things, will include the installation of predominately Premium-Plus seating, including iPic’s latest Patented Pod Seats and Chaise Lounges. Premium-Plus seating currently comprises approximately 35% of seating in our Generation I auditoriums. Our Generation III designs, which contain significantly more Premium-Plus seating, generate significantly higher revenue per screen than our Generation I locations. iPic expects to complete a minimum of three remodels in 2018. After a detailed review of all eight locations with Generation I auditoriums, the Company has decided against reinvestment at its Glendale, Wisconsin location, where the Bayshore Mall is now in receivership. The Company has instead closed this location effective March 8, 2018. In 2017, this location generated a store-level EBITDA loss.\n2. Opening New iPic Locations Domestically :\nThe Company currently operates 115 screens at 15 locations in 9 states with the ultimate long-term goal of reaching 200 locations across the US. iPic recently signed leases for two new iPic locations in Fort Lauderdale, FL and Atlanta, GA and has a robust pipeline of additional sites in lease negotiations. The Company plans to open at least four new domestic locations per year starting in 2019.\n3. Pursuing International Growth Opportunities :\nThe Company is actively exploring the potential to expand the iPic brand internationally through licensed and/or asset-light partnerships. iPic announced today the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with BAS Global Investments to develop its one-of-a-kind, world-class luxurious restaurant-and-theater iPic locations throughout The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. If the Company is able to finalize all agreements and successfully obtain needed operating licenses, iPic believes there is the potential for 25 to 30 iPic locations within the next ten years, and would expect to expand in all parts of the country starting in Riyadh and Jeddah.\n4. Increasing Digital Growth Options (Membership and Sponsorship) :\nThe Company plans to leverage its growing membership network as the brand expands and increases its market presence. In 2017, iPic’s active users that have visited a location over the past year accounted for approximately 47% of revenue. In 2017, the Company earned $1.8 million from corporate sponsorships and believes that it has the opportunity to significantly grow its local and national sponsorship revenue.\nFinancial Results\nThe Company reported third quarter results, ended September 30, 2017, including:\nTotal revenue of $32.6 million. Comparable-store sales decrease of 16.5%. Store-level EBITDA*, a non-GAAP measure, of $2.7 million. EBITDA*, a non-GAAP measure, loss of $(2.4) million. Adjusted EBITDA*, a non-GAAP measure, loss of $(1.7) million. Net loss was $(11.5) million.\nThe Company reported preliminary, unaudited full year 2017 results, ended December 31, 2017, including:\nTotal revenue of $139 million to $140 million. Comparable-store sales decrease of 7.5% to 8.0%. Store-level EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, of $13.7 million to $14.3 million. EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, loss of $(9.0) million to $(8.5) million. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, loss of $(1.5) million to $(1.0) million. Net loss between $(45) million and $(44) million.\n* Store-level EBITDA, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of store-level EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP, are set forth in the schedules accompanying this release. See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nInitial Public Offering and Subsequent Events\nOn February 1, 2018, the Company successfully closed its initial public offering (\"IPO\") of common stock at a price to the public of $18.50 per share. iPic issued 1,248,159 shares of Class A common stock (which included converting 429,730 Class B common stock to Class A common stock) and received gross proceeds of approximately $15.1 million.\nSeparately, on February 1, 2018, the Company closed a private placement of $2.5 million from an affiliate of one of its existing investors, Regal Cinemas, which had previously invested $12 million at a price of $18.13 per share in April 2017. Additionally, PVR Cinemas, the largest exhibitor in India, invested $4 million at the same price of $18.13 per share in November 2017.\nConference Call\niPic will host a conference call today at 5:00 p.m. EST. The conference call can be accessed live over the phone by dialing (201) 493-6779. A replay will be available after the call and can be accessed by dialing (412) 317-6671; the passcode is 13676497.

An archive of the webcast will be available at the same location on the website shortly after the call has concluded.\nKey Financial Definitions\nNew store openings – Our ability to expand our business and reach new guests is influenced by the opening of additional iPic locations in both new and existing markets. The success of our new iPic locations is indicative of our brand appeal and the efficacy of our site selection and operating models.\nComparable-store sales – Comparable-store sales are a year-over-year comparison of sales at iPic locations open at the end of the period which have been open for at least 12 months prior to the start of such quarterly period. It is a key performance indicator used within the industry and is indicative of acceptance of our initiatives as well as local economic and consumer trends. Our comparable iPics consisted of 11 and 14 iPics as of the end of 2016 and 2017, respectively. From period to period, comparable-store sales are generally impacted by attendance and average spend per person. Spend per person is, in turn, composed of pricing and sales-mix changes.\nStore-level EBITDA – A non-GAAP measure, store-level EBITDA consists of total revenues less store-level expenses that include food-and beverage cost-of-goods sold, box-office-and-other-income costs-of-goods-sold, labor costs, occupancy expenses and other-operating expenses.\nEBITDA – A non-GAAP measure, is defined as net income before net interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA – A non-GAAP measure, is defined as net income before net interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and which also excludes equity-based compensation expense, losses on the disposal of property and equipment, as well as certain non-recurring items that the Company does not believe directly reflect its core operations.\nAbout iPic ® Entertainment Inc.\nEstablished in 2010 and headquartered in Boca Raton, FL, iPic ® Entertainment is America’s premier luxury restaurant-and-theater brand.

Non-GAAP Measures\nCertain financial measures presented in this press release, such as EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Store-Level EBITDA are not recognized under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which we refer to as “GAAP.” We define these terms as follows:\n“EBITDA” means, for any reporting period, net loss before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, “Adjusted EBITDA” is a supplemental measure of our performance and is also the basis for performance evaluation under our executive compensation programs. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for the impact of certain non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance. These items include, among other things, equity-based compensation expense, pre-opening expenses, other income and loss on disposal of property and equipment, impairment of property and equipment as well as certain non-recurring charges. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an appropriate measure of operating performance because it eliminates the impact of expenses that do not relate to our ongoing business performance. “Store-Level EBITDA” is a supplemental measure of our performance which we believe provides management and investors with additional information to measure the performance of our locations, individually and as an entirety. Store-Level EBITDA is defined by us as EBITDA adjusted for pre-opening expenses, other income, loss on disposal of property and equipment, impairment of property and equipment, non-recurring charges, and general and administrative expense. We use Store-Level EBITDA to measure operating performance and returns from opening new stores. We believe that Store-Level EBITDA is another useful measure in evaluating our operating performance because it removes the impact of general and administrative expenses, which are not incurred at the store level, and the costs of opening new stores, which are non-recurring at the store-level, and thereby enables the comparability of the operating performance of our stores for the periods presented. We also believe that Store-Level EBITDA is a useful measure in evaluating our operating performance within the entertainment and dining industry because it permits the evaluation of store-level productivity, efficiency and performance, and we use Store-Level EBITDA as a means of evaluating store financial performance compared with our competitors.\nYou are encouraged to evaluate the adjustments we have made to GAAP financial measures and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Store-Level EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur income and expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments used to calculate the non-GAAP financial measures contained in this press release.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are included in this press release because they are key metrics used by management and our board of directors to assess our financial performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. Store-Level EBITDA is utilized to measure the performance of our locations, both individually and in entirety.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not GAAP measures of our financial performance or liquidity and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as measures of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Store-Level EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Additionally, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as they do not reflect tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures, iPic openings and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future, including, among other things, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results in addition to using EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA supplementally. Our measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures $ Thousands Nine Months Ended Three Months Ended September 30, September 30, September 30, September 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net loss $ (33,955 ) $ (23,074 ) $ (11,530 ) $ (9,359 ) Plus: Interest expense 11,918 8,532 4,135 3,273 Income tax expense 65 46 22 16 Depreciation and amortization expense 14,552 11,293 4,974 4,001 EBITDA (7,421 ) (3,202 ) (2,399 ) (2,069 ) Plus: Pre-opening expenses 1,634 3,094 2 2,223 Other income (5 ) - - - Impairment of property and equipment 3,332 - - - Non-recurring charges 1,069 - 696 - Adjusted EBITDA (1,391 ) (109 ) (1,701 ) 154 Plus: General and administrative expense 11,062 9,196 4,423 3,355 Store-Level EBITDA 9,671 9,088 2,722 3,509 Investor Relations:\nICR\nMelissa Calandruccio, CFA\niPicIR@icrinc.com\n646-277-1273\nMedia Relations:\nThe Gab Group for iPic ® Entertainment Corporate\nMichelle Soudry\nmsoudry@thegabgroup.com\n561-750-3500\nJonesworks\nStephanie Jones/Michelle Bower\nipic@jonesworks.com\n212-839-0111\nSource: iPicEntertainment Inc.",
