In the comparable quarter of 2016, the Company reported a net loss of $142.4 million, or $2.96 per share, based on a weighted average of 48,106,827 diluted shares outstanding.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported a net loss of $43.8 million, or $0.63 per share, based on a weighted average of 69,182,302 diluted shares outstanding. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company reported a net loss of $223.5 million, or $10.87 per share, based on a weighted average of 20,565,652 diluted shares outstanding.\nThe net loss, excluding loss on debt extinguishment, for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.6 million compared to $19.5 million in fourth quarter of 2016 excluding vessel impairment. The improvement of $17.9 million is mainly due to improvement in charter rates achieved by the Company in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe net loss excluding loss on debt extinguishment for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $28.8 million or $0.42 per share based on weighted average of 69,182,302 diluted shares outstanding. In the comparable period of 2016, the Company reported a net loss, excluding vessel impairment and restructuring charges, of $88.6 million or $4.31 per share based on weighted average of 20,565,652 diluted shares outstanding.\nNet time and voyage charter revenues\nNet time and voyage charter revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $74.6 million compared with $41.8 million recorded in the comparable quarter in 2016. The increase in revenue was primarily due to an increase in charter hire rates as well as an increase in the size of the Company's owned fleet resulting from the purchase of 10 Ultramax vessels offset by the sale of four vessels as well as an increase in the chartered in vessels in 2017.\nNet revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $236.8 million compared to $124.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net revenues increased by 90% compared to the prior year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase in charter hire rates attributable to an improvement in the dry bulk market and increase in available days. The increase in available days was due to the acquisition of 10 Ultramax vessels and an increase in chartered-in days offset by the sale of four vessels during 2017. The chartered-in days for the year ended December 31, 2017 were 3,353 compared to 1,494 in the prior year.\nVoyage expenses\nVoyage expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $18.2 million compared to $14.2 million in the comparable quarter in 2016. The increase was mainly attributable to an increase in the number of freight voyages in the current quarter compared to the comparable quarter in the prior year as well as increased bunker prices year over year.\nVoyage expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $62.4 million and $42.1 million, respectively. Voyage expenses have primarily increased due to an increase in bunker prices as well as an increased number of freight voyages performed in the current year compared to the prior year.\nVessel expenses\nVessel expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $21.2 million compared to $17.2 million in the comparable quarter in 2016. The increase in vessel expenses is attributable to the increase in the size of the Company's owned fleet after the acquisition of 11 Ultramax vessels in the fourth quarter of 2016 and during 2017 which was partially offset by vessel sales in the years 2016 and 2017. The ownership days for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were 4,383 and 3,720, respectively.\nAverage daily vessel operating expenses for our fleet for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were $4,844 and $4,633, respectively.\nVessel expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $78.6 million and $74.0 million, respectively. The increase in vessel expenses is attributable to the increase in the size of the Company's owned fleet due to the purchase of 10 Ultramax vessels offset by the sale of four vessels during 2017 and four vessels during 2016. The ownership days for the year ended December 31, 2017 were 16,293 compared to 15,408 for the prior year ended December 31, 2016.\nAverage daily vessel operating expenses for our fleet for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $4,825 compared to $4,803 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCharter hire expenses\nCharter hire expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $11.3 million compared to $5.9 million in the comparable quarter in 2016. The increase in charter hire expense was principally due to an increase in the number of chartered in vessels as we expand on our commercial platform. The total chartered in days for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were 1,050 compared to 749 for the comparable quarter in the prior year.\nCharter hire expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $31.3 million and $12.8 million, respectively. The increase in charter hire expenses in 2017 compared with 2016 was mainly due to an increase in short term chartered-in vessels resulting from successful implementation of our business strategy. The chartered-in operating days for 2017 were 3,353 compared to 1,494 in 2016. The Company currently charters in one vessel on a long term basis.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $9.2 million and $10.0 million, respectively. Total depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 includes $7.9 million of vessel and other fixed asset depreciation and $1.3 million relating to the amortization of deferred drydocking costs. Comparable amounts for the three months ended December 31, 2016 were $9.0 million of vessel and other fixed asset depreciation and $1.0 million of amortization of deferred drydocking costs. The decrease in depreciation expense is attributable to the sale of vessels during 2016 and 2017 and lower book value of vessels subsequent to impairment charges aggregating $129.0 million recorded in the first and fourth quarters of 2016 offset by the purchase of 11 Ultramax vessels in the fourth quarter of 2016 and during 2017. The amortization of drydock expense increased by $0.3 million due to additional amortization of three vessels which were drydocked in the third quarter of 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $33.7 million and $38.9 million, respectively. Total depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes $29.4 million of vessel and other fixed assets depreciation and $4.3 million relating to the amortization of deferred drydocking costs. Comparable amounts for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $35.6 million of vessel and other fixed asset depreciation and $3.3 million of amortization of deferred drydocking costs. The decrease was primarily due to a lower depreciation base after the impairment write down of $122.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $6.1 million in the first quarter of 2016 and the sale of four vessels during 2017 and five vessels during 2016 offset by the purchase of 10 Ultramax vessels during 2017 and one Ultramax vessel during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $8.1 million and $7.5 million, respectively. These general and administrative expenses include stock-based compensation of $1.7 million and $1.3 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses was mainly attributable to increases in stock-based compensation expense.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $33.1 million and $22.9 million, respectively. These general and administrative expenses include stock-based compensation of $8.7 million and $2.2 million for 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2017 was primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation expenses due to additional stock grants in the fourth quarter of 2016 and first quarter of 2017 and compensation expense due to increased head count. The higher General and administrative expenses are reflective of the expansion of our operating platform. Additionally, the general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 included the reversal of approximately $1.4 million of stock-based compensation expense relating to the forfeited stock awards granted to the former Chief Financial Officer.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $8.2 million and $6.6 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to interest expense on the Ultraco Debt Facility and the Norwegian Bond Debt offset by savings on interest expense on the Second Lien Facility.\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $29.4 million and $21.8 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to the payment-in-kind interest on our Second Lien Facility and change in our debt structure which includes additional debt under the Ultraco Debt Facility, the Norwegian Bond Debt and the First Lien Facility. The interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 included only nine months of payment-in-kind interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs because the Second Lien Facility was closed on March 30, 2016.\nRestructuring charges\nRestructuring charges for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $5.9 million. These costs primarily relate to the professional fees incurred in connection with the restructuring transaction, which was closed on March 30, 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended 2017 was $7.4 million, compared with net cash used in operating activities of $45.4 million in 2016. The increase in cash flow provided by operations resulted from an increase in the charter hire rates achieved by the Company coupled with an improving dry bulk market offset by negative working capital changes as an increasing percentage of our revenue is earned on voyage charters as opposed to time charters.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended 2017 was $155.2 million, compared to $9.3 million in the prior year. During 2017, the Company purchased 10 Ultramax vessels for $174.4 million and made an advance on the purchase of one Ultramax vessel for $2.2 million. This was partially offset by the proceeds from sale of four vessels for $26.0 million. During 2017, the Company purchased a certificate of deposit maturing in one year of $4.5 million. During 2016, the Company purchased a 2016 built Ultramax for $18.9 million. In addition, the Company paid $1.9 million as an advance payment for the acquisition of a 2017 built Ultramax. The Company sold four vessels during 2016 for net proceeds of $13.0 million during the year.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $127.6 million compared with $106.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company received net proceeds of $96.0 million in the December Private Placement, which closed on January 20, 2017 and repaid $13.0 million of its term loan under the First Lien Facility from the proceeds of the sale of the vessels Redwing, Sparrow, Woodstar and Wren. Additionally, the Company completed a refinancing of approximately $191.0 million under the First Lien Facility and $77.4 million under the Second Lien Facility through the New First Lien Facility of $65.0 million and issuance of $200.0 million Senior Secured Bonds issued at a discount of $1.9 million. The Company received $61.2 million from the Ultraco Debt Facility in the second quarter of 2017 and paid $0.9 million to the lender. The Company paid $0.9 million to the lenders of the New First Lien Facility as part of the debt refinancing transaction. The Company also paid $5.2 million in other financing costs in connection with the refinancing transaction.\nIn 2016, the Company received net proceeds of $85.7 million from a private common stock placement, which closed on August 10, 2016, $60.0 million received from our Second Lien Loan Facility and $15.2 million from the revolver under the First Lien Facility offset by repayment of $21.3 million of our term loan and $30.2 million of our revolver each under the First Lien Facility. The Company also paid $3.1 million in deferred financing costs.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $56.3 million compared to a cash and cash equivalents balance of $76.5 million at December 31, 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the total availability in the revolving credit facility under the Super Senior Facility was $15.0 million.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company’s debt consisted of $200.0 millions in outstanding bonds, net of $6.0 million debt discount and debt issuance costs under the Norwegian Bond Debt, $65.0 million in term loan and revolver, net of $1.2 million debt discount and debt issuance costs under the New First Lien Facility and $61.2 million, net of $1.2 million debt discount and debt issuance costs under the Ultraco Debt Facility.\nCapital Expenditures and Drydocking\nOur capital expenditures relate to the purchase of vessels and capital improvements to our vessels which are expected to enhance the revenue earning capabilities and safety of these vessels.\nIn addition to acquisitions that we may undertake in future periods, the Company's other major capital expenditures include funding the Company's program of regularly scheduled drydocking necessary to comply with international shipping standards and environmental laws and regulations. Although the Company has some flexibility regarding the timing of its drydocking, the costs are relatively predictable. Management anticipates that vessels are to be drydocked every two and a half years for vessels older than 15 years and five years for vessels younger than 15 years. Funding of these requirements is anticipated to be met with cash from operations. We anticipate that this process of recertification will require us to reposition these vessels from a discharge port to shipyard facilities, which will reduce our available days and operating days during that period.\nDrydocking costs incurred are deferred and amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the period through the date of the next scheduled drydocking for those vessels. In 2017, three of our vessels were drydocked and we incurred $2.6 million in drydocking related costs.

We define EBITDA as net income /(loss) under GAAP attributable to the Company adjusted for interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and others, to assess our operating performance as compared to that of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical costs basis. Our Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss), operating income (loss), cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because all companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted to exclude the items which represent certain non-cash, one-time and other items such as vessel impairment, gain / loss on sale of vessels, restructuring expenses and stock-based compensation expenses that the Company believes are not indicative of the ongoing performance of its core operations. The following table presents a reconciliation of our net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.\nThree Months Ended For the Years Ended December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 Net loss $ (16,584,425 ) $ (142,389,148 ) $ (43,796,685 ) $ (223,522,435 ) Adjustments to reconcile net loss to EBITDA: Interest expense 8,236,248 6,644,487 29,376,994 21,799,146 Interest Income (132,690 ) (123,827 ) (651,069 ) (215,433 ) Income taxes — — — — EBIT (8,480,867 ) (135,868,488 ) (15,070,760 ) (201,938,722 ) Depreciation and amortization 9,196,289 9,979,264 33,690,686 38,884,322 EBITDA 715,422 (125,889,224 ) 18,619,926 (163,054,400 ) Non-cash, one-time and other adjustments to EBITDA(1): 16,503,408 123,928,662 20,855,674 136,544,184 Adjusted EBITDA $ 17,218,830 $ (1,960,562 ) $ 39,475,600 $ (26,510,216 ) (1) One-time and other adjustments to EBITDA includes; loss on debt extinguishment, vessel impairment, restructuring charges, stock-based compensation, (gain)/loss on sale of vessels and amortization of fair value below contract value of time charter acquired.\nReconciliation of net revenues to TCE\nTime charter equivalent (\"TCE\") is a non-GAAP financial measure that is commonly used in shipping industry primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters, because charter hire rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in per-day amounts while charter hire rates for vessels on time charters generally are expressed in such amounts. The Company defines TCE as shipping revenues less voyage expenses and charter hire expenses, adjusted for the impact of one legacy time charter and gains on FFAs and bunker swaps, divided by the number of owned available days. TCE provides additional meaningful information in conjunction with shipping revenues, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, because it assists Company management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of its vessels and in evaluating their financial performance. The Company's calculation of TCE may not be comparable to that reported by other companies. Owned available days is the number of our ownership days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire due to vessel familiarization upon acquisition, repairs, vessel upgrades or special surveys. The shipping industry uses available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues.\nThree Months Ended For the Years Ended December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 Revenues, net $ 74,587,441 $ 41,835,941 $ 236,784,625 $ 124,492,844 Less: Voyage expenses (18,155,542 ) (14,191,559 ) (62,351,252 ) (42,093,714 ) Charter hire expenses (11,312,576 ) (5,866,255 ) (31,283,956 ) (12,845,468 ) Reversal of one legacy time charter 426,037 431,516 1,036,738 2,938,611 Realized gain/loss on FFAs and bunker swaps (348,908 ) (112,523 ) (17,770 ) (561,495 ) TCE revenue $ 45,196,452 $ 22,097,120 $ 144,168,385 $ 71,930,778 Owned available days 4,324 3,653 15,891 15,201 TCE $ 10,452 $ 6,049 $ 9,072 $ 4,732 Glossary of Terms:\nOwnership days: We define ownership days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet has been owned by us. Ownership days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we recorded during a period.\nChartered-in under operating lease days: We define chartered-in under operating lease days as the aggregate number of days in a period during which we chartered-in vessels. Periodically, the Company charters in vessels on a single trip basis.\nAvailable days: We define available days, which the Company has recently updated and reflected in the table above in this press release to better reflect the way management views the business, as the number of our ownership days and chartered-in days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire due to vessel familiarization upon acquisition, repairs, vessel upgrades or special surveys. The shipping industry uses available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues.\nOperating days: We define operating days as the number of available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off-hire due to any reason, including unforeseen circumstances. The shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues.\nFleet utilization: We calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of our operating days during a period by the number of our available days during the period. The shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a company’s efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels and minimizing the amount of days that its vessels are off-hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee, vessel upgrades, special surveys or vessel positioning. Our fleet continues to perform at high utilization rates.\nDefinitions of capitalized terms\nUltraco Debt Facility: Ultraco Debt Facility refers to the credit facility for $61.2 million entered into by and among Ultraco, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, as borrower,certain wholly-owned vessel-owning subsidiaries of Ultraco, as guarantors (the “Ultraco Guarantors”), the lenders thereunder (the “Ultraco Lenders”), the swap banks party thereto, ABN AMRO Capital USA LLC, as facility agent and security trustee for the Ultraco Lenders, ABN AMRO Capital USA LLC, DVB Bank SE and Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (publ), as mandated lead arrangers, and ABN AMRO Capital USA LLC, as arranger and bookrunner on June 28, 2017.
