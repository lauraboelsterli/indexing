We believe this positive momentum will extend into 2018 and anticipate increased growth rates for both gross profit and adjusted EBITDA this year as we continue to execute on our strategy.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\n(Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and all amounts are in USD. The complete fourth quarter Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and Management Discussion & Analysis, including segmented results, are available at www.sedar.com and www.sec.gov .)\nRevenue increased to $87.7 million from $82.0 million. Principal Revenue was $82.0 million and Other Partner Revenue was $5.7 million. Gross Profit grew 10% to a record $13.1 million, compared to $11.9 million. Total Adjusted Operating Expenses 3 grew 9% to $9.0 million, compared to $8.3 million. Net Income totaled $1.2 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to Net Loss of $(3.7) million, or $(0.24) per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA increased almost 11% to $4.1 million, compared with $3.7 million.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Highlights\n(Unless otherwise stated, all comparisons are on a year-over-year basis and all amounts are in USD. The complete full year Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements and Management Discussion & Analysis, including segmented results, are available at www.sedar.com and www.sec.gov .)\nRevenue increased 8% on a year-over-year basis to $347.6 million from $321.8 million in 2016. Principal Revenue was $330.6 million, up 7% from 2016. Other Partner Revenue was $16.8 million, an increase of 33% from last year. Gross Profit grew to $47.0 million, an increase of 8% compared to $43.3 million in 2016 and at the high end of the guidance range. Total Adjusted Operating Expenses were $33.8 million, up an expected 8% over $31.2 million in the prior year period, primarily due to incremental rental costs associated with new head office and operational costs related to the Points Travel segment. Net Income was $3.4 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, compared to Net Loss of $(1.5) million, or $(0.10) per diluted share, in 2016. Included in the Net Loss for 2016 was a non-recurring, non-cash expense of $5.0 million associated with the write-down of Points’ investment in the China Rewards retail coalition. Adjusted EBITDA was a record at $13.2 million, an increase of 9% compared to $12.1 million in 2016 and at the high end of the guidance range. As of December 31, 2017, total funds available, comprised of cash together with short term investments, restricted cash and amounts with payment processors, was $79.2 million.\n1 Gross profit is defined as total revenues less the direct cost of revenues. Gross profit is considered by management to be an integral measure of financial performance and represents the amount of revenues retained by the Corporation after incurring direct costs. However, gross profit is not a recognized measure of profitability under IFRS.\n2 Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, foreign exchange, share-based compensation and impairment of long-term investments) is considered by management to be a useful supplemental measure when assessing financial performance. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is an important indicator of the Corporation's ability to generate liquidity through operating cash flow to fund future capital expenditures and working capital needs. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered a substitute for Net Income, which we believe to be the most directly comparable IFRS measure.\n3 Adjusted Operating Expenses consists of employment expenses excluding stock based compensation, marketing and communications, technology services, and other operating expenses. Adjusted Operating Expenses is not a measure of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered a substitute for total expenses, which we believe to be the most directly comparable IFRS measure.\n2017 Business Highlights\nLoyalty Currency Retailing: Launched six new loyalty program partners in 2017 and announced an additional international partner, which is expected to be in market in the first half of 2018 Platform Partnerships: Launched five new Platform Partners programs during 2017, with and additional partnership expected to launch early this year Points Travel: Launched two new Points Travel programs in 2017, with an additional four loyalty program partner announcements expected to launched in the first half of 2018 During the fourth quarter, Points repurchased for cancellation approximately 172,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $11.04 per share through its Automatic Share Purchase Plan in conjunction with its Normal Course Issuer Bid. For the full year, total repurchases were approximately 334,000 shares at a weighted average price of $10.19 per share for a total of $3.4 million compared to repurchases of 428,228 shares at a weighted average price of $7.43 for a total of $3.2 million in 2016.\nOutlook\nThe company is reiterating financial guidance for the year ending December 31, 2018, as follows:\nGross profit is expected to increase between 10% and 20% over 2017 Adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase between 20% and 40% over 2017\nCFO Transition\nPoints also announced today that Michael D’Amico, Chief Financial Officer will be retiring from his position after almost three years with the company.

Mr. D’Amico will remain with the company through the end of the year to facilitate a smooth transition.\n“Serving as CFO for a company with such highly motivated, competent and dedicated people as Points, has been a pleasure, both personally and professionally.
