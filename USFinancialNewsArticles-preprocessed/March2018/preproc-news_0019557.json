    "text": "Anthony Cirelli recorded his first career three-point game by getting a goal and two assists as the Tampa Bay Lightning cruised to a 5-3 victory over the visiting New York Rangers on Thursday.\nPlaying in his fourth career game, Cirelli scored Tampa Bay’s third goal and assisted on its second goal and fourth goal.\nCedric Paquette and Adam Erne scored in the first period when the Lightning took a two-goal lead before the Rangers even registered a shot on goal.\nChris Kunitz scored Tampa Bay’s fourth goal after getting the assist on Paquette’s tally. Tyler Johnson scored the final goal for the Lighting.\nAndrei Vasilevskiy made 27 saves and became the first goaltender to reach 40 wins.\nTampa Bay won its fourth straight and gained a point in its ninth straight contest (8-0-1).\nRyan Spooner scored and had two assists for the Rangers, who dropped their second straight.\nMats Zuccarello and Kevin Hayes netted the other New York goals.\nHenrik Lundqvist allowed four goals on 31 shots before getting pulled with 7:25 left in the second.\nThe Lightning took the lead 2:30 into the game shortly after Rangers defenseman John Gilmour coughed up the puck in the neutral zone. Ryan Callahan dished to Kunitz, who sped down on a 2-on-1 and fired a shot off Lundqvist’s left shoulder. Paquette tapped the rebound into the vacated net.\nTampa Bay made it 2-0 when Erne scored his third goal off another Rangers turnover by Ryan Spooner. Erne gained possession and scored from the low slot while falling to the ice.\nThe Lightning extended the lead to 3-0 1:53 into the second on a tip-in by Cirelli, who scored his second career goal.\nSpooner got the Rangers on the board by skating into the slot with 12:50 remaining, pouncing on a rebound and lifting it into the net.\nCirelli recorded his third point when Lundqvist mishandled the puck behind the net. Cirelli gained possession and hit Kunitz with a pass from behind the net for the easy goal.\nJohnson scored the final goal late in the second, and Zuccarello made it 5-2 3:27 into the third. Hayes scored with 2:19 remaining on a tip-in.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
