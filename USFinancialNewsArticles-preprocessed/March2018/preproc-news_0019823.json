    "text": "(Fixes dateline)\nTEHRAN, March 5 (Reuters) - French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Monday there remained “much work to do” with Iran over its ballistic missile programme and its role in regional conflicts.\nLe Drian said after a day of tough talks in Tehran that France would continue discussions with Iran, adding that it was imperative to find a way to bring stability to region.\nLe Drian was in Tehran on a delicate mission to reaffirm Europe’s support for a nuclear deal that opened Iran’s economy while echoing U.S. concern about Tehran’s missile programme and role in regional conflicts.
