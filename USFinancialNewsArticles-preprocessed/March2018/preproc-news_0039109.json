The company on Wednesday reported a 98 percent jump in quarterly net profit , beating estimates, though revenues rose slower than expected at 51 percent.\nCompany president Martin Lau warned at a briefing on Wednesday that the company plans to invest \"aggressively\" in areas including video and payment , which may hurt margins.\nWith a market capitalization of around $535 billion, Tencent is Asia's most valuable listed company and the world No.5 behind Apple , Alphabet , Amazon.com and Microsoft .",
