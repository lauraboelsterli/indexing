    "text": "0 COMMENTS LONDON—Oil prices edged down Wednesday on the back of an unexpected rise in U.S. crude stockpiles and a strengthening U.S. dollar.\nBrent crude , the global benchmark, was down 0.66% at $69.65 a barrel on London’s Intercontinental Exchange . On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate futures were more than 1% lower at $64.59 a barrel.\nLate Tuesday, the American Petroleum Institute released data showing a 5.3 million-barrel increase in crude supplies for the week ended March 23.\nTraders and analysts surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect official data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, due Wednesday afternoon, to show that crude stockpiles rose by 1.4 million barrels last week.\nMeanwhile, the U.S. dollar, which tends to have an inverse relationship with dollar-denominated commodities like oil, edged up Wednesday. The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index , which measures the greenback against a basket of 16 other currencies, was up 0.13% midmorning.\nRumaila oil field in Basra, Iraq. Photo: essam al sudani/Reuters Crude prices had been on the upswing over the past two weeks, bolstered by rising geopolitical tensions and declining crude inventories outside the U.S. Brent at the end of last week closed above $70 a barrel for the first time since late January, nearly hitting a three-year high.\nBut if the EIA’s data shows a build in crude stocks and a further rise in U.S. oil production, the price correction is likely to continue, according to analysts at Commerzbank .\nSaudi Arabia has continued to publicly reiterate its commitment to holding back oil output, which should help see “price risks tilted to the upside” in the near future, according to Giovanni Staunovo, commodity analyst at UBS Wealth Management.\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries—of which Saudi Arabia is the de facto head—and 10 producers outside the cartel including Russia, have been holding back crude output by 1.8 million barrels a day since the start of last year. The agreement is currently set to run through the end of this year, but Saudi Arabia has indicated it is open to further cooperation on production curbs into 2019.\nAmong refined products, Nymex reformulated gasoline blendstock—the benchmark gasoline contract—was down 0.20% at $2.01 a gallon. ICE gasoil, a benchmark for diesel fuel, changed hands at $613.75 a metric ton, down 0.57% from the previous settlement.\nWrite to Christopher Alessi at christopher.alessi@wsj.com",
