    "text": "0 COMMENTS Michelle de Kretser’s novel “The Life to Come” (Catapult, 344 pages, $26) is stitched from loosely linked stories that take place mostly in Australia but also in France and Sri Lanka. This patchwork approach is something we’re seeing more and more often, a response to the evolving realities of globalization. As borders become increasingly permeable, novelists try to conjure the invisible filaments that connect people across continents.\nUsually, as in the case of Joan Silber’s “Improvement” or Mohsin Hamid’s “Exit West,” the tapestry is hopeful, reflecting a shared humanity that rises above superficial distinctions. But on this point Ms. de Kretser begs to differ. Reflecting a pessimism that’s almost refreshing in its candor, “The Life to Come” is mordantly skeptical about mankind’s capacity for empathy. Its characters are largely unburdened by hidden depths. On balance, they’re exactly as vain and dull and silly as they appear to others. Few are likable. The nearest this astringent and strangely absorbing novel comes to an affirmation of universality is when a solitary middle-aged expatriate thinks, “All around me are ordinary people and I am ordinary like them.”\nThe novel’s recurring figure is an Australian writer of commercial novels named Pippa Reynolds, whose craving for approval is as obnoxious as her habit of jotting down things acquaintances say for use in her books. One section concerns Pippa’s baseless suspicion that her husband is having an affair with a Muslim woman befriended by her in-laws. Another centers on the doomed relationship between Pippa’s friend and a Sri Lankan immigrant. Others concentrate on loners—a translator in France inching toward spinsterhood, a Sri Lankan woman in Sydney whose longtime housemate has been stricken with dementia.\nThe lie of multiculturalism is at the heart of these episodes. The characters are constantly announcing their large-hearted solidarity with the oppressed (“indigenous people or battery hens, it scarcely mattered”), but in a pinch self-interest takes the day. Australians are “visionaries, adept at denial,” the Sri Lankan man thinks, contemplating this talent for consoling delusions. “[They] had seen pastures where there was red dust, geraniums where there were trees as old as time, no one where there were five hundred nations.”\nThe novel is filled with brilliant, quick-fire characterizations like that one. Pippa’s judgmental mother-in-law “was the kind of woman who could carry off a fine knit. She referred to herself as ‘a citizen of conscience’ and was in favor of sculpture in malls.” A young man is said to play the piano the way his family “went at life: with great verve, ignoring wrong notes.” Ms. de Kretser’s mistrust of unity means that the novel never coheres into a satisfying whole. Its richness is on the sentence level. Far from a herald of 21st-century interconnection, “The Life to Come” is a scalpel-sharp work of Flaubertian social realism—but now the provincial setting whose customs it mercilessly dissects encompasses all Australia, if not all the world.\nNafkote Tamirat’s debut, “The Parking Lot Attendant” (Holt, 225 pages, $26) , casts a cocked eye on Boston’s Ethiopian community, taking the perspective of a nameless 15-year-old girl who has lived alone with her father since her mother’s disappearance nearly a decade before. Because her father is so taciturn he “sometimes lost his voice from using it so little,” she searches for guidance from an older man named Ayale. Ayale operates a downtown parking lot and acts as the ringleader to the Ethiopian immigrants who congregate there. Learned, charismatic, secretive and magnetic, he begins to mentor the impressionable narrator, and before long he’s paying her to deliver mysterious packages throughout the city.\nLoneliness and criminality pulse through Ms. Tamirat’s novel, yet these undercurrents are covered by what she calls “a smoke screen of funny.” Dry comic quips appear with the regularity of a lounge act. (Upon spotting a man with half a goatee, the narrator wonders “if something had happened to him, because it didn’t occur to me that someone might do that intentionally.”) The nonstop joking makes “The Parking Lot Attendant” read much like a Jewish immigrant tale from the past century, in which a dispossessed ethnic minority organizes around a shady cult-like leader who dreams, as Ayale does, of returning his people to an ancient homeland.\nSuch dreams are typically metaphoric, but here, after a series of murders and a federal investigation, the narrator and her father flee to a remote island colony that Ayale intends to rule like a king before relocating to Ethiopia. It’s a jarring and curiously incomplete U-turn into political intrigue, and one feels that a more confident novel would have cut out the thriller formulations. Ms. Tamirat has reason to be confident. When her novel is good, it’s very good indeed.",
