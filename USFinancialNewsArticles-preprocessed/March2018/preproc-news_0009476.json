Please refresh the page if you do not see a player above at that time.]\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is testifying before the House Appropriations budget subcommittee about the administration's spending plan for fiscal year 2019.\nAmong the proposals is a 3 percent, or $400 million cut to the Treasury allocation. In addition, President Donald Trump wants to spend more in the military, border security and fighting the opioid crisis. The budget has to negotiate its way around the massive tax cut Congress passed in December.\nTrump wants to spend $1.5 trillion on infrastructure improvements, though the federal outlay will be well below that number. The plan calls for matching funds from state and local governments as well as the private sector.\nRead more :\nFed's Kaplan: Rate hikes are necessary as the US nears full employment\nTrump tweets: There are people in the White House 'that I want to change'\n'We're standing up to our foreign competition': Steel CEO on Trump tariffs",
