These forward-looking statements represent Fairmount Santrol’s expectations or beliefs concerning future events, and it is possible that the results described in this press release will not be achieved. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside of Fairmount Santrol’s control that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. These factors include: legal, regulatory and other matters that may affect the timing of Fairmount Santrol’s ability to complete the proposed merger with Unimin Corporation, or Unimin, if at all, including the inability to complete the proposed merger due to the failure to obtain Fairmount Santrol stockholder approval or governmental or regulatory clearances; prior to the completion of the proposed merger, Fairmount Santrol’s and/or Unimin’s respective businesses experiencing disruptions due to transaction-related uncertainty or other factors making it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, business partners or governmental entities; the ability of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol to integrate their businesses successfully and to achieve anticipated synergies and the anticipated cost, timing and complexity of integration efforts; the future financial performance, anticipated liquidity and capital expenditures of the combined company and other risks related to the operation of the combined company; changes in prevailing economic conditions, including continuing pressure on and fluctuations in demand for, and pricing of, Fairmount Santrol’s products; loss of, or reduction in business from Fairmount Santrol’s largest customers or their failure to pay Fairmount Santrol; possible adverse effects of being leveraged, including interest rate, event of default or refinancing risks, as well as potentially limiting Fairmount Santrol’s ability to invest in certain market opportunities; the level of cash flows generated to provide adequate liquidity; Fairmount Santrol’s ability to successfully develop and market new products, including Propel SSP®; Fairmount Santrol’s rights and ability to mine its property and Fairmount Santrol’s renewal or receipt of the required permits and approvals from government authorities and other third parties; Fairmount Santrol’s ability to implement and realize efficiencies from capacity expansion plans, facility reactivation and cost reduction initiatives within its time and budgetary parameters; expectations regarding results of railcar contract renegotiations; increasing costs or a lack of dependability or availability of transportation services or infrastructure and geographic shifts in demand; changing legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to Fairmount Santrol’s business, including environmental, mining, health and safety, licensing, reclamation and other regulation relating to hydraulic fracturing (and changes in their enforcement and interpretation); silica-related health issues and corresponding litigation; seasonal and severe weather conditions; and other operating risks that are beyond Fairmount Santrol’s control.\nAny forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and, except as required by law, Fairmount Santrol does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for Fairmount Santrol to predict all such factors. When considering these forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in Fairmount Santrol Holdings Inc.’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The risk factors and other factors noted in Fairmount Santrol’s filings with the SEC could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.\nAdditional Information\nIn connection with the proposed transaction, a registration statement on Form S-4 will be publicly filed with the SEC.
