    "text": "WATERTOWN, Conn., March 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Crystal Rock Holdings, Inc. (NYSE MKT:CRVP) (“Crystal Rock”) today announced the completion of the cash tender offer by CR Merger Sub, Inc. (“Purchaser”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cott Corporation (NYSE:COT) (TSX:BCB) (“Cott”), for all of the outstanding shares of Crystal Rock for $0.97 per share in cash.\nCott is a route based service company with a leading volume-based national presence in the North America and European home and office bottled water delivery industry and a leader in custom coffee roasting, blending of iced tea, and extract solutions for the U.S. foodservice industry. Cott’s platform reaches over 2.4 million customers or delivery points across North America and Europe supported by strategically located sales and distribution facilities and fleets, as well as wholesalers and distributors.\nThe depositary and paying agent for the tender offer has advised that, as of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on March 20, 2018, the expiration of the tender offer, 16,055,804 shares of common stock of Crystal Rock were tendered pursuant to the tender offer, representing approximately 75.17% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Crystal Rock on a fully-diluted basis (as determined pursuant to the merger agreement). In addition, the depositary has received commitments to tender approximately 82,636 shares of common stock of Crystal Rock in accordance with guaranteed delivery procedures, which, when combined with the shares tendered and not properly withdrawn from the tender offer, equal approximately 75.56% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Crystal Rock on a fully-diluted basis. The condition to the tender offer that at least one share more than 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of Crystal Rock (calculated on a fully-diluted basis (as determined pursuant to the merger agreement)) be validly tendered and not validly withdrawn and all other conditions to the tender offer have been satisfied. Accordingly, Purchaser has accepted for payment and will promptly pay the depositary for all validly tendered shares.\nCrystal Rock expects that Cott will complete the acquisition of Crystal Rock as promptly as practicable on March 23, 2018 through a merger under Section 251(h) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the “DGCL”).

Following completion of the merger, shares of Crystal Rock common stock will no longer be listed on the NYSE MKT.\nABOUT CRYSTAL ROCK HOLDINGS, INC.\nCrystal Rock (NYSE MKT:CRVP), operating through its subsidiary Crystal Rock LLC, markets and distributes water and coffee service, office supplies, refreshment beverages and other break room items to the commercial office and at home markets throughout the Northeast.
