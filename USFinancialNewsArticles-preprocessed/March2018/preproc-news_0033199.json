While crude seems to be on the boil, big names like Cathay are making a comeback, albeit slowly. To discuss what the next decade holds for transport in Asia, we speak to Corrine Png, founder and CEO at Crucial Perspective, previously executive director and the head of Asia Pacific transportation research at J.P Morgan.
