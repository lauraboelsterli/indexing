    "text": "Published: Mar 16, 2018 6:12 a.m. ET Share \nNontraditional roadshow includes financial presentation open to the public Getty Images Daniel Ek, CEO and co-founder of Spotify. \nBy Maureen Farrell Austen Hufford \nSpotify Technology SA executives outlined their vision for the music-streaming company and dug into its financials, opening to the public a presentation that typically remains behind closed doors, as the company hurtles toward an April initial public offering. \nAs it paves its nontraditional path to go public via a so-called direct listing, Spotify said it would prioritize growth over profit and seek to differentiate itself and defend its leadership position in music streaming from a broad field of powerful competitors. It said it plans for its shares to start trading April 3 and will provide financial guidance on March 26. \nSpotify’s debut will be one of the biggest technology IPOs in recent years. Its listing will likely be coveted by investors who are seeking high growth that often comes with big-name, highly valued technology IPOs, which have been rare of late. \nIn a twist on a traditional IPO roadshow, Spotify co-founder and Chief Executive Daniel Ek and other senior executives took the stage at a studio space in front of potential investors in Manhattan’s SoHo neighborhood, while the public could access the presentation through a live stream. In a normal IPO, such meetings are reserved for fund managers and other big Wall Street investors.",
