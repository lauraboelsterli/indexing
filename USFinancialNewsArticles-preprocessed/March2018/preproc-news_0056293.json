    "text": "EDDYSTONE, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- InsPro Technologies Corporation (OTC Bulletin Board: ITCC) , a leading provider of core policy administration software for Group and Individual Life, Health, and Annuity products that enables insurance carriers and third-party administrators to quickly respond to evolving market needs, improve customer service, and reduce operating costs, today announced its financial results for the three and twelve month period ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nRevenues were $6,089,303 in the Fourth Quarter of 2017; a 23% increase as compared to $4,946,978 in the Fourth Quarter of 2016. The increase was the result of increased professional services fees to the Company’s largest client as measured by 2017 revenue. Net income was $1,218,621 in the Fourth Quarter of 2017 as compared to a net loss of $841,150 in the Fourth Quarter of 2016. Net income in the Fourth Quarter of 2017 was favorably impacted by higher revenues from existing clients combined with lower IT consulting staffing as compared to the Fourth Quarter 2016, primarily as a result of the implementation of cost reduction initiatives.\n2017 Full Year Highlights\nRevenues were $21,694,921 in the year ended December 31, 2017; a 1% decrease as compared to the $21,830,928 in the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was the result of lower post implementation services to several clients and lower implementation services to the Company’s largest client as measured by 2017 revenue. Partially offsetting the decline in revenue was higher ASP and hosting and software license revenue. Net income was $1,622,420 in the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to a net loss of $2,667,937 in the year ended December 31, 2016. Net income in 2017 was favorably impacted by lower employee and IT consulting staffing as compared to the same period in 2016, primarily as a result of the implementation of cost reduction initiatives. Included in 2017’s net income was $144,948 of non cash stock based fees and compensation expense as compared to $1,522,105 of non cash stock based fees and compensation expense included in 2016’s net loss.\nDavid Anderson, Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Our fourth quarter and year-end results close out an exciting and successful 2017. The long-standing partnerships we have with our customers continue to provide a solid foundation as we move into 2018. We expect 2018 to be a strong year and we look to continue our positive momentum.”\nAbout InsPro Enterprise\nInsPro Enterprise, a Life and Health insurance policy administration system, is a single technology solution used to manage all insurance processing requirements supporting multiple product lines as well as hybrid products for both group and individual policies on a single web-based platform.
