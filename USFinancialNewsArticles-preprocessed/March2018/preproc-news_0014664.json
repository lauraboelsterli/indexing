FILE PHOTO - Motor Sport - 2013 FIA Formula 3 Euope Championship - Silverstone - 13/4/13 Tatiana Calderon of Double R Racing in action Mandatory Credit: Action Images / Matthew Childs The 24-year-old, who is backed by the team’s Mexican sponsor Telmex, is competing in the GP3 series again this season after finishing 18th overall last year. Swiss-based Sauber were the first Formula One team to have a female principal, although Monisha Kaltenborn departed last year. They also had Swiss racer Simona de Silvestro as an ‘affiliated driver’ in 2014. Italian Antonio Giovinazzi, who raced for Ferrari-powered Sauber as a stand-in last year, is the reserve driver. Formula One has not had a woman driver start a grand prix since 1976. Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Jon Boyle",
