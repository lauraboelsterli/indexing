The index is down nearly 7 percent year to date, making it one of the worst performers among European indexes.\nAB Foods led gainers on the FTSE on Thursday, up 1.7 percent following an upgrade to ‘buy’ from Goldman Sachs on expectations a weak dollar would underpin its profit recovery.\nRolls Royce built on Wednesday’s rally after UBS raised its price target on the stock. The engine maker rose more than 11 percent in the previous session after its turnaround plan boosted profit by more than expected.\nA big mover was mid cap Countrywide after a disappointing update.\nIts shares tumbled 12 percent as Britain’s largest estate agency scrapped its dividend after poor performance in its main sales and lettings business drove full-year core earnings down 22.5 percent.\nAviva fell 1.6 percent. The insurer reported a 2 percent rise in operating profit and said it planned to return 500 million pounds to shareholders. KBW analysts described the results as a “mixed bag”.\nStill in earnings, pizza delivery firm Domino’s Pizza rose 2 percent following a better-than-expected 10.2 percent rise in its full year pretax profit.\nSoft drinks company Britvic rose 6 pct after Morgan Stanley upgraded it to ‘overweight’, saying the price offers an attractive entry point.
