    "text": "Shares of Nvidia lost as much as 10 percent on Tuesday, after the chipmaker announced it would suspend self-driving tests across the globe.\nThe suspension followed a fatal Uber accident last week in which a self-driving vehicle killed a pedestrian in Arizona.\n\"Ultimately [automated vehicles] will be far safer than human drivers, so this important work needs to continue. We are temporarily suspending the testing of our self-driving cars on public roads to learn from the Uber incident. Our global fleet of manually driven data collection vehicles continue to operate,\" a Nvidia spokesperson said in a statement.\nThe chipmaker is testing self-driving technology globally including in New Jersey, Santa Clara, Japan and Germany.\nNvidia stock closed the regular session down 7.76 percent, at $225.52.\n--Thomson Reuters contributed to this report.",
