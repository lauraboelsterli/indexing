Our balance sheet has never been stronger. Along with generating record revenues in 2017, we successfully paid down substantial amounts of debt, raised new equity, and significantly increased our book value,” said Robert Frichtel, Chief Executive Officer of General Cannabis. “Our liquidity continued to improve in 2018, as we paid off all of our debt and generated an additional $4.2 million through the exercise of warrants and stock options.”\n“Along with growth through acquisitions, we are also focused on organic growth and driving each segment to profitability,” said Joe Hodas, Chief Operating Officer of General Cannabis. “I have spent extensive time with each of our segment leaders, diving into staffing models, revenue projections and challenges. With initial analyses in hand and the existing General Cannabis infrastructure, I believe we can capitalize on new lines of business, cross-sale opportunities between segments, and operating efficiencies. I am eager to work with the great team in place here at General Cannabis to drive strong top line and bottom line results.”\nMichael Feinsod, Executive Chairman of General Cannabis, stated: “Our business expanded during the year, which positions us for continued national expansion. We will continue to hire talented executives to support our growth. General Cannabis has never been in a better position to take advantage of our strong infrastructure and continue to focus on growth through acquisitions. Our strong platform and corporate team can quickly help entrepreneurial cannabis companies achieve success.”\nOur full results can be found at www.generalcann.com .\nCurrent Business Trends and 2018 Outlook\nWe estimate the following revenue trends in 2018:\n- Security Segment revenues should increase as we expand into California and explore additional service offerings, such as expanding our security consulting services.\n- Our Marketing Segment should show significant growth, as we pursue national distributers and retailers for our apparel lines, and benefit from our cross-marketing efforts for design revenue.\n- Our Operations Segment revenues should trend upwards as California clients come on line and, additionally, we take advantage of having separate, established teams that can provide a variety of services on discrete projects. We may make more acquisitions in 2018, as we look for both immediately accretive opportunities and targets that are still in the start-up phase. We believe that the cannabis industry is, in many respects, still in the early stages of its development. We must consider established as well as entrepreneurial businesses to benefit our current and future results. The latter may require us to fund working capital needs until they begin generating positive cash flows. We expect to see improvements to profitability at the segment level, as we focus on revenue growth, expense management and the bottom line. We continue to face significant regulatory risks and uncertainty, while at the same time additional states legalize cannabis.\nAbout General Cannabis Corp\nGeneral Cannabis Corp is the comprehensive national resource for the highest quality service providers available to the regulated cannabis industry. We are a trusted partner to the cultivation, production and retail sides of the cannabis business. We do this through a combination of strong operating divisions such as security, marketing, operational consulting and products, real estate and financing.
