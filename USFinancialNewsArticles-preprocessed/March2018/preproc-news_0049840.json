    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump was voicing concern about Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ) when he commented about the company on Twitter on Thursday, but the administration has no action dealing with the company at this time, the White House said.\nThe logo of Amazon is seen on the building, as a spokesperson confirms the dismissal of some of its employees in Costa Rica without detailing the numbers, according to local media in San Jose, Costa Rica March 21, 2018. REUTERS/Juan Carlos Ulate. “The president has expressed his concerns with Amazon,” White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters told reporter on Air Force One en route to Ohio, where Trump was delivering a speech. “We have no actions at this time.”\nTrump accused Amazon.com on Thursday of not paying enough tax, taking advantage of the U.S. postal system and putting small retailers out of business, but did not present any evidence to back up his criticisms or suggest any specific actions he planned to take.\nReporting by Steve Holland; Writing by David Alexander; Editing by Susan Thomas\n ",
