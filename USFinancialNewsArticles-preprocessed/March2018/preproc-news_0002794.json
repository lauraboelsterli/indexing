    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Monday that she wanted financial services to be part of a deal on the country’s new relationship with the European Union after Brexit, echoing comments she made in a speech last week.\nFILE PHOTO - Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May talks to Andrew Marr for the Marr Show on BBC television in London, Britain March 2, 2018. Picture taken March 2, 2018. Jeff Overs/BBC/Handout via REUTERS “One of the elements that we will be looking at as part of our future economic partnership with the European Union is a partnership on financial services,” May said in a response to a question after giving a speech on housing.\n“The role that the City of London here plays is not just important for us, it’s important for the whole of the European Union... so we will be looking to include financial services.”\nEU officials have said May’s approach amounts‘cherry picking’ the best bits of the EU’s single market. They say Britain must accept less access to the single market if it continues to rule out some of the conditions for member countries, including the free movement of people from across the EU.\nWriting by William Schomberg; Editing by Alistair Smout\n ",
