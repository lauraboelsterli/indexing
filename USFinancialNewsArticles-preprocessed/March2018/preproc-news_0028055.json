    "text": "March 15, 2018 / 1:15 PM / Updated 39 minutes ago Alibaba plans listing in mainland China - WSJ   (Reuters) - E-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd is working on a plan to list on a stock exchange in its home country, China, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. People ride a double bicycle past a logo of The Alibaba Group at the company's headquarters on the outskirts of Hangzhou, Zhejiang province November 10, 2014. REUTERS/Aly Song/Files Alibaba is evaluating ways in which its shares could be traded by investors on the mainland, the newspaper reported on.wsj.com/2peqrpb , adding that a secondary listing in China could happen as soon as this summer if the country's securities rules are changed to allow listings of foreign companies. The news of a probable listing comes a few weeks after it was reported that China may allow its offshore-listed tech giants to sell a form of shares on the mainland. Alibaba, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is one of the worldâ€™s biggest tech companies listed offshore. Others include Baidu Inc, JD.com Inc and Tencent Holdings Ltd. Alibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reporting by Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta",
