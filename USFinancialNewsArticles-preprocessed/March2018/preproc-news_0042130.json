    "text": "FRISCO, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Jamba, Inc. (Nasdaq: JMBA) (the “Company”) announced that as expected, on March 20, 2018 it received a letter from Nasdaq stating that the Company is not in compliance with Nasdaq’s filing requirements set forth in Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) as a result of the Company’s delay in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2017 (“Form 10-K”). The notification received has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company’s common stock on Nasdaq.\nThe notification states that the Company’s failure to file its 2017 Form 10-K may serve as an additional basis for the delisting of the Company’s securities from Nasdaq and that the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the “Panel”) will consider this matter in their decision regarding the Company’s continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. The Company has until March 27, 2018 to present its views with respect to this additional deficiency to the Panel.\nAs previously disclosed, the Company is also not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rules 5620(a) and 5810(c)(2)(G), since the Company has not yet held an annual meeting of stockholders within twelve months of the end of the Company’s fiscal year ended January 3, 2017.\nThe Company completed and filed its 2016 Form 10-K and 2017 Form 10-Qs on February 12, 2018 and March 15, 2018 respectively, within the timeline prescribed in its compliance plan with the Panel. With these efforts complete, full attention and resources will be applied to diligently completing the 2017 fiscal year-end financial statements and year-end audit. The Company continues to work cooperatively with Jamba’s newly appointed auditor, Whitley Penn LLP to complete this effort, and to thereafter file the 2017 Form 10-K as soon as practicable.\nThe final milestone in the Company’s comprehensive plan to be fully current is to host the 2016 annual stockholders meeting which the Company expects to combine with its 2017 meeting and hold by the summer of 2018. With the completion of these remaining steps, the Company expects to return to a normal reporting cadence.\nThe Company will submit its views to the Panel by March 27, 2018 to request that the Panel grant an extension to file the 2017 Form 10-K and reiterate its request for an extension to hold the annual stockholders meeting.\nAbout Jamba, Inc.\nJamba, Inc. (Nasdaq: JMBA) through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Jamba Juice Company, is a global healthy lifestyle brand that inspires and simplifies healthful living through freshly blended whole fruit and vegetable smoothies, bowls, juices, cold-pressed shots, boosts, snacks, and meal replacements.
