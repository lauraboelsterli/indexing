    "text": "26 COMMENTS The U.S. on Thursday joined the U.K., France and Germany to condemn the poisoning in Britain of a Russian former double agent as “an assault on U.K. sovereignty,” saying it constituted a breach of international law and calling on Russia to explain its role in the attack.\nThe show of unity deepens the isolation of Moscow, which has responded defiantly to the U.K.’s accusations that it was culpable in the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novichok, a nerve agent developed in the Soviet Union.\nPresident Donald Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel shared the U.K.’s assessment that it was highly likely that Russia was responsible for the attack, the first using a nerve agent in a North Atlantic Treaty Organization member.\nIt comes as the Trump administration issued its first sanctions against Russia for meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential elections, as well as for its role in a cyberattack known as NotPetya and in the nerve-agent poisoning in Salisbury, England.\n“We, the leaders of France, Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom, abhor the attack that took place against Sergei and Yulia Skripal,” the joint statement, released by the U.K. government, read.\n“It is an assault on U.K. sovereignty and...a clear violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention,” it said. “It threatens the security of us all.”\nThe U.K., which is expelling 23 Russian diplomats , has pushed for backing from its allies, amid questions about whether the U.S. and others would deliver strong support.\n“It certainly looks like the Russians were behind it,” Mr. Trump said at the White House. His comments came two days after he told reporters that “as soon as we get the facts straight, if we agree with them, we will condemn Russia or whoever it may be.”\nMr. Trump said he had spoken to U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May, and said the attack was “something that should never, ever happen, and we’re taking it very seriously, as I think are many others.”\nAlso in Washington, more than 40 U.S. lawmakers committed their “full support” to the U.K. government’s response to the attack. The letter to Mrs. May was signed by Democrats and Republicans on the Congressional United Kingdom Caucus. Among the signatories was Rep. Devin Nunes (R., Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, which is investigating Russian meddling in U.S. elections.\nMoscow has in recent days called claims of its involvement “nonsense.” As the confrontation looked ready to spiral into tit-for-tat measures, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned that Moscow would soon retaliate through official channels before making a public announcement.\n“You can understand that as polite people we will first of all deliver our response to our British colleagues,” Interfax reported him as saying.\nHours after Mrs. May announced the expulsions as part of a slate of punitive measures on Wednesday, Russia’s Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Russia would respond likewise.\nU.K. Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson announced that Britain would invest £48 million ($66.9 million) in a chemical-weapons defense center.\nCommenting on Moscow’s potential response to the expulsion of its diplomats, Mr. Williamson said: “Frankly, Russia should go away and should shut up.”\nThe expulsion is the biggest from the U.K. since 1985, when the country required 25 Soviet citizens accused of spying to leave.\nU.K. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told the British Broadcasting Corp. he was “very struck by the kind of smug sarcasm with which the Russians are denying” their culpability in the attack.\n“Because they want effectively to have it both ways,” he said. “They want to say ‘not us,’ but they also want the world, and the people of Russia, to know that it is them.”\nMr. Macron told Mrs. May in a phone conversation that there was no “plausible explanation other than that Russia was responsible for the attack,” Downing Street said in a statement. That came after British media pounced on a statement by his spokesman that Paris was waiting for the allegations to be proven.\nSeparately, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg condemned the use of the nerve agent, saying it “has no place in a civilized world.”\n“This is the first offensive of a nerve agent on alliance territory since NATO’s founding,” he said.\n—Julian E. Barnes in Brussels and Natalie Andrews in Washington contributed to this article.\nWrite to Wiktor Szary at Wiktor.Szary@wsj.com and Thomas Grove at thomas.grove@wsj.com",
