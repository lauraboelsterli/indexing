    "text": "YAVNE, Israel, March 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MediWound Ltd. (Nasdaq:MDWD), a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company bringing innovative therapies to address unmet needs in severe burn and wound management, today announced that the Company will release financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 at 7:00 am Eastern time on Monday, March 19, 2018.\nFollowing the release, MediWound's management will host a conference call for the investment community beginning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time to discuss the financial results and to answer questions.\nShareholders and other interested parties may participate in the conference call by dialing 800-289-0438 (in the U.S.) 1809-212-883 (Israel), or 323-794-2423 (outside the U.S. & Israel) and entering passcode 5092591. The call also will be broadcast live on the Internet on the Company’s website at http://ir.mediwound.com/events-and-presentations .\nA replay of the call will be accessible two hours after its completion through April 2, 2018 by dialing 844-512-2921 (in the U.S.) or 412-317-6671 (outside the U.S.) and entering passcode 5092591. The call will also be archived on the Company website for 90 days at www.mediwound.com .\nAbout MediWound Ltd.\nMediWound is a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing novel therapeutics based on its patented proteolytic enzyme technology to address unmet needs in the fields of severe burns, chronic and other hard-to-heal wounds. MediWound’s first innovative biopharmaceutical product, NexoBrid ® , received marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency as well as the Israeli and Argentinian Ministries of Health, for removal of dead or damaged tissue, known as eschar, in adults with deep partial and full-thickness thermal burns and was launched in Europe and Israel and Argentina. NexoBrid ® represents a new paradigm in burn care management, and clinical trials have demonstrated, with statistical significance, its ability to non-surgically and rapidly remove the eschar earlier and without harming viable tissues.\nMediWound's second innovative product, EscharEx ® is a topical biological drug being developed for debridement of chronic and other hard-to-heal wounds and is complementary to the large number of existing wound healing products, which require a clean wound bed in order to heal the wound. EscharEx ® contains the same proteolytic enzyme technology as NexoBrid ® , and benefits from the wealth of existing development data on NexoBrid ® . In two Phase 2 studies, EscharEx ® has demonstrated safety and efficacy in the debridement of chronic and other hard-to-heal wounds, within a few daily applications.
