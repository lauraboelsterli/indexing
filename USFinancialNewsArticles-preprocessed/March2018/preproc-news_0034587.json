German Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomes Ireland's Prime Minister, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar at the chancellery in Berlin, Germany, March 20, 2018. REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch Speaking at a joint news conference with visiting Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, Merkel said: “We were very happy to hear yesterday that there is an agreement between Britain and the European Union about the transition period.” She added: “But of course we know that there are still a lot of problems to solve, especially the border issue in Northern Ireland, which is very sensitive and of course crucial, and all participants agree that a solution on that must be found and Germany completely supports Ireland’s position on this.” On Monday Britain and the European Union agreed to a transition period to avoid a “cliff edge” Brexit next year, albeit only after London accepted a potential solution for Northern Ireland’s land border that may face stiff opposition at home.
