    "text": "ST. JOHN’S, Newfoundland and Labrador--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Altius Minerals Corporation (“Altius” or the “Corporation”) reports attributable royalty revenue (1) of $46.7 million for the eight month period ended December 31, 2017 compared to $46.0 million for the 12 month period ended April 30, 2017. Revenue for the two month period ended December 31 2017 was $14.0 million. The abbreviated current reporting periods are as a result of a change to the Corporation’s year end to December 31 to better align its reporting with the majority of its underlying royalty paying counterparties.\nThe strong pro-rata revenue growth, with the 8 month total exceeding the prior 12 month total, reflects further improved commodity prices for most base metal and bulk mined commodities and also a retroactive pricing adjustment of $2.6 million related to prior payment periods for the Esterhazy potash royalty.\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) of $38.2 million for the eight months represents a margin of approximately 81%, and compares to $34.7 million or 75% for the year ended April 30, 2017. Net earnings for the eight months improved to $18.2 million or, $0.42 per share This compared to a net loss of $65 million in the year ended April 30, 2017 that included a $72 million non-cash impairment.\nHigher copper prices and production volumes at Chapada and higher copper and zinc prices at 777 increased base metal royalty revenue to 44.5% of total royalty revenue. Thermal coal royalty revenue declined to 20.2% as mine sequencing at Sheerness moved on to lower paying royalty lands. Potash royalty revenue increased to 15.8% on continuing volume improvements mainly related to production ramp ups at Rocanville and improving prices but also on receipt of the retroactive Esterhazy royalty payment. Iron ore related revenue increased to 13% on increased ownership of Labrador Iron Ore Royalty Corporation (“LIORC”) and increased pricing for the high quality iron ore products for which it receives royalties. These factors are discussed in more detail in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations (MD&A).\nThe Corporation’s junior equities portfolio value of $44.1 million at year end compared to $33.4 million at May 1, 2017 and to $22.5 million at May 1, 2016. In addition, Altius holds a $10 million, 8% debenture that is convertible into Champion Iron Ore common shares at $1.00 per share.\nBalance sheet liquidity was strong at year end with approximately $62 million in cash after debt repayments of $12.5 million. Combined cash and revolving credit facility availability stood at approximately $130 million, which does not include the junior equity portfolio referenced above or an approximately $85.7 million equity holding in LIORC.\nThe following table summarizes the financial results for the eight months ended December 31, 2017.\nEight months ended Year ended December 31, 2017 April 30, 2017 April 30, 2016 $ $ $ Revenue Attributable royalty 46,747 46,028 33,083 Project generation 654 337 2 Attributable revenue (1) 47,401 46,365 33,085 Adjust: joint venture revenue (17,144) (21,168) (21,881) IFRS revenue per consolidated financial statements 30,257 25,197 11,204 Net earnings (loss) 18,218 (65,006) (38,464) Net earnings (loss) per share basic and diluted 0.42 (1.50) (0.97) Total assets 534,202 420,445 411,492 Total liabilities 134,077 104,979 91,277 Cash dividends declared & paid to shareholders 4,323 5,204 4,789 (1) See non-IFRS measures section of this MD&A for a reconcilation and explanation of attributable revenue. (1) Attributable revenue and adjusted EBITDA are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.

For a reconciliation of these measures to various IFRS measures, please see the Corporation’s MD&A which is available at http://altiusminerals.com/financial-statements .\nAdditional information on the Corporation’s results of operations and developments in its project generation division are included in the Corporation’s MD&A and Financial Statements which were filed on SEDAR today and are also available on the Corporation’s website at www.altiusminerals.com .\nThe Corporation also confirms that its board of directors has declared a cash dividend on its common shares of four cents per common share payable to all shareholders of record at the close of business on March 22, 2018.
