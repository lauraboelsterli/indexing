    "text": "SEATTLE, March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- WMIH Corp. (Nasdaq: WMIH) (the \"Company\") today reported financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIn 2017, the Company reported a net operating loss of $2.5 million on revenues of $7.9 million and operating expenses of $10.4 million. Net income before taxes and dividends was $25.9 million primarily as a result of $28.2 million of other income resulting from a gain on change in value of the derivative embedded conversion feature recorded by the Company in relation to its Series B Convertible Preferred Stock. Net income attributable to common and participating stockholders was $7.8 million after $18.1 million of preferred stock dividends.\nBill Gallagher, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, said, \"In February 2018, following our successful efforts to amend and extend the mandatory redemption date of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, we executed definitive documentation to merge with Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. (NYSE: NSM). We are very excited about this accretive combination, which we believe will significantly benefit and deliver value to our stockholders given the synergies between the WMIH platform and financial attributes and Nationstar's experienced management team and best-in-class servicing and originations platform. We are working closely with the Nationstar team to successfully complete the merger in the second half of 2018.\"\nAs of December 31, 2017, WMIH had approximately $578.9 million of restricted cash held in escrow, which represents the net proceeds of the Series B Preferred Convertible Stock issuance, net of fees and expenses paid in pursuit of acquisitions. The funds held in escrow are only available for Acquisitions and Qualified Acquisitions (as defined in WMIH's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation). Additionally, WMIH had $28.9 million of unrestricted cash available for general corporate purposes as of year-end.\nIMPORTANT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND WHERE TO FIND IT\nThis communication is being made in respect of the proposed merger transaction involving WMIH and Nationstar.
