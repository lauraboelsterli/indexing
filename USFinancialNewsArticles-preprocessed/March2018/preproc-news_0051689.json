    "text": "March 28, 2018 / 7:06 AM / Updated 38 minutes ago Capello quits CSL side Jiangsu Suning Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Former England and AC Milan head coach Fabio Capello has left Chinese Super League (CSL) side Jiangsu Suning, the club confirmed on social media on Wednesday. Fabio Capello, new head coach of Chinese Super League Jiangsu Suning club, speaks during a news conference in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, China June 14, 2017. REUTERS/Stringer \nCapello took over last June after a dismal run under South Korean coach Choi Yong-soo left Jiangsu in the relegation zone and the 71-year-old Italian departs just three games into the new campaign. \nHe has been replaced by Romanian Cosmin Olaroiu, who led Al Ahli of the United Arab Emirates to the final of the Asian Champions League in 2015, where they lost to Chinese Super League champions Guangzhou Evergrande. \nJiangsu have won one and lost two of their opening fixtures this season, although Chinese media reported disagreements with the club’s management rather than the team’s form are the reason for Capello’s departure. \nCapello led Jiangsu to safety last season with the club eventually finishing 12th in the 16-team top flight of Chinese football. \nHe becomes the second coach to leave his position in the Chinese Super League since the season started last month. Dalian Yifang announced last week that Ma Lin would be replaced by former Real Madrid coach Bernd Schuster. Reporting by Michael Church; Editing by John O'Brien",
