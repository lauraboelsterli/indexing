    "text": "PARIS, March 3 (Reuters) - An avalanche in the French Pyrenees swept away five Spanish skiers on Saturday, killing one and injuring another, authorities in the Hautes-Pyrenees said.\nThe avalanche hit near the Aragnouet-Bielsa tunnel linking France to Spain. Three of the skiers managed to extract themselves from the snow and were unharmed. The injured skier was taken to hospital in the city of Toulouse.\nOn Friday, an avalanche in the French Alps killed four people.. Their guide escaped unharmed and was questioned by police on Friday evening. He was released on Saturday.
