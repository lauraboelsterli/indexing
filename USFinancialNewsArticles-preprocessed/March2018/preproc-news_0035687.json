The changes we have made to our direct sales teams are allowing us to sign new enterprise customers and to achieve significant expansion from existing customers. In addition, our growing roster of channel partners is bringing us to opportunities where enterprise grade cloud-based mobile workflows are needed.\nMr. Pombo continued, \"Our Rapid Mobile Application Development (RMAD) solution has been deployed successfully for a range of business processes in enterprise, including safety automation; enterprise asset management; and field service management, either as a standalone solution or as a mobile extension of existing solutions. The no-code platform, increasingly recognized by leading industry analysts, allows easy adoption by non-technical line-of-business owners in enterprise, scales with IT requirements, and co-exists very well with solutions provided by our expanding partner ecosystem.”\nFinancial Highlights – 2017 Year\nRecurring revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 10% to $11,663,056, compared to $10,621,011 for twelve months ended December 31, 2016 Recurring revenue consisted of non-operator channel recurring revenue of $7,612,321 (32% growth over 2016) and operator channel recurring revenue of $4,050,735 (16% decrease over 2016) Total revenue for year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 8% to $12,772,908, compared to $11,787,891 for the year ended December 31, 2016 Gross margin for 2017 was $10,420,181 or 82% of total revenue compared to $9,659,281 or 82% in 2016.
