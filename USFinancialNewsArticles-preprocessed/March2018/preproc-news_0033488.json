The ECB has softened its framework to deal with non-performing loans after a previous version led to fierce criticism, especially in Italy, where the bad loan burden is particularly heavy. “It is clearly spelled out that this addendum is not a generalized measure, it does not give banks any legal obligation,” Giovanni Sabatini, director general of Italian banking association ABI, said at a conference in Rome.
