    "text": "MP MENASHE, Israel--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Caesarstone Ltd. (NASDAQ:CSTE), a manufacturer of high quality engineered quartz surfaces, today announced that it has accepted the resignation of its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Raanan Zilberman. The Board of Directors has appointed Mr. Yair Averbuch, Caesarstone’s Chief Financial Officer, as Interim Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately. Mr. Ophir Yakovian, Caesarstone’s incoming Chief Financial Officer, will transition to his new role in the coming weeks as planned.\nDr. Ariel Halperin, Chairman of Caesarstone’s Board of Directors, will partner closely with Mr. Averbuch during the interim period. Caesarstone has retained a global executive search firm with the intent to quickly identify new Chief Executive Officer candidates.\nDr. Halperin commented “The Company conveys its appreciation to Raanan for his contributions to Caesarstone over the last year and we wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors. The Board has deep and abiding confidence in the strength of the Company’s brand, the power of its competitive position in its markets around the world, and the dedication of its management team and employees. I am looking forward to working closely with Yair and Caesarstone’s management team to ensure a seamless transition.”\nMr. Averbuch commented, “I am confident that in close partnership with Ariel and our management team our strategic and operational focus will remain clear, and we will continue to make progress toward the realization of a powerful, shared vision for the future success of our Company.”\nAbout Caesarstone\nCaesarstone manufactures high quality engineered quartz surfaces, which are used in both residential and commercial buildings as countertops, vanities, wall cladding, floors and other interior surfaces. The wide variety of colors, styles, designs and textures of Caesarstone® products, along with Caesarstone’s inherent characteristics such as hardness, non-porous, scratch and stain resistance and durability, provide consumers with excellent surfaces for their internal spaces which are highly competitive to granite, manufactured solid surfaces and laminate, as well as to other engineered quartz surfaces. Caesarstone’s three collections of products — Classico, Supernatural, and Concetto — are available in over 50 countries around the world.
