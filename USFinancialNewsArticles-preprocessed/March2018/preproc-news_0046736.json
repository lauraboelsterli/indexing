    "text": "RICHMOND, Va., March 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Capital Square 1031 announced today that the company fully subscribed its Delaware statutory trust offering, CS1031 Tampa Pharma, DST in a record time of 60 days. The facility is comprised of a 71,150-square-foot office/R&D laboratory in Tampa, Florida, 100 percent leased on a long-term triple net basis to Capsugel, an award-winning global contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO).\n\"Capital Square 1031 has acquired 59 properties for its growing DST platform, with an emphasis on medical-oriented properties,\" said Louis Rogers, founder and chief executive officer of Capital Square 1031. \"Capital Square's first DST was the headquarters for a health care company. The Tampa Pharma offering, Capital Square's 58th property, is the Tampa regional headquarters and R&D lab for Capsugel, a growing bio-pharma company owned by Lonza Group Ltd., a global Swiss company with annual sales exceeding $5 Billion (USD). Capsugel provides research and development services to pharmaceutical companies seeking to outsource the development of new drugs.\"\nThe facility, located at 4910 Savarese Circle, is 100 percent leased on a long-term, triple net basis by a strong tenant in a growth mode. The location is critically important, Florida has become a hub for the life sciences with over 1,100 bio-tech, pharmaceutical and medical device companies. Florida is growing its economy at a record pace.\nThe facility was fully redeveloped in 2015 to serve as a regional HQ and R&D lab. The build-out was highly specialized to meet the tenant's special needs. See Florida Governor Rick Scott's grand opening of the facility here .\n\"Our investors really stepped up; this offering was fully subscribed in only 60 days,\" added Rogers. \"Tampa Pharma shows that Section 1031 exchange investors are drawn to high quality real estate 100% leased on a triple net basis by a strong tenant with a compelling story – the bio-pharma growth story. And the icing on the cake is that Florida is an income tax-free state, which means our investors will not pay income tax in Florida. Offerings of this sort are designed to provide superior risk-adjusted returns – strong and growing cash flow – and the potential for capital appreciation.\"\nThe property was acquired in late December 2017 by CS1031 Tampa Pharma, DST.\nAbout Capital Square 1031\nCapital Square 1031 is a national real estate investment and management company.
