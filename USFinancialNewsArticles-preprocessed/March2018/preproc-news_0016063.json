    "text": "March 9, 2018 / 7:10 AM / Updated 7 minutes ago Japan tax agency head intends to resign - Kyodo Reuters Staff 1 Min Read TOKYO (Reuters) - The head of Japan’s National Tax Agency, Nobuhisa Sagawa, who has been under fire over remarks in parliament about a suspected cronyism scandal that threatens to erode Prime Minister Abe’s popularity, intends to resign, Kyodo news agency reported on Friday. A tax agency spokesman could not confirm the report. Suspicions that a school operator with ties to Abe’s wife, Akie, got a sweetheart deal on land for a school in the western city of Osaka helped dent the premier’s popularity last year. The former head of the school operator and his wife were arrested in July on suspicion of illegally receiving subsidies. Reporting by Linda Sieg and Kiyoshi Takenaka; Editing by Richard Borsuk",
