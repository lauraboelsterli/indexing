    "text": "NEW YORK, March 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Pomerantz LLP is investigating claims on behalf of investors of BioScrip, Inc. (\"BioScrip\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: BIOS). Such investors are advised to contact Robert S. Willoughby at rswilloughby@pomlaw.com or 888-476-6529, ext. 9980.\nThe investigation concerns whether BioScrip and certain of its officers and/or directors have engaged in securities fraud or other unlawful business practices.\n[Click here to join a class action]\nOn March 8, 2018, BioScrip released its preliminary fourth quarter and full year financial results, but also disclosed that the Company had begun an internal accounting review because it \"identified internal control deficiencies in connection with account reconciliations for certain asset and liability accounts,\" and that this may cause a delay in the filing of its Form 10-K. The Company additionally announced that it \"has identified and will report a material weakness related to certain spreadsheets used to calculate periodic adjustments to\" certain accounts.\nOn this news, BioScrip's share price has fallen sharply during intraday trading on March 8, 2018.\nThe Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Florida, and Los Angeles, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 80 years later, the Pomerantz Firm continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomerantzlaw.com\nCONTACT:\nRobert S.
