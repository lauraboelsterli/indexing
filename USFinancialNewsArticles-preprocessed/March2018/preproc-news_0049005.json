    "text": "SANTIAGO, March 26 (Reuters) - Workers at Antofagasta PLC’s Los Pelambres copper mine in Chile reached agreement on a new labor contract, defusing the risk of a strike, the union said on Monday.\nWorkers in the mine’s largest union had last week rejected an offer for a new labor contract, triggering a period of government mediation and raising the spectre of the first-ever strike at a mine owned by Chilean miner Antofagasta.\nThe new contract, agreed upon by 82 percent of union members, includes a signing bonus of $30,500 per worker, and an average salary increase of 3 percent.\n“After six months of negotiations, we’ve reached a satisfactory deal. All of the conditions and benefits we obtained are above market-average,” said Sergio Munoz, president of Los Pelambres’ largest union of workers.\nAntofagasta did not immediate reply to requests for comment.\nLos Pelambres, which recently received environmental approval for a $1.1 billion infrastructure upgrade plan, produced 356,300 tons of copper last year.\nChile is the world’s top copper producer.
