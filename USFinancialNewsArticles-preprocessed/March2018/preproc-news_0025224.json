    "text": "March 12, 2018 / 9:22 AM / Updated 26 minutes ago Swansea can draw confidence from Huddersfield stalemate - Mawson Reuters Staff 2 Min Read (Reuters) - Ten-man Swansea City’s Premier League draw with Huddersfield Town felt like a victory and has given the Welsh club a dose of confidence ahead of Saturday’s FA Cup quarter-final against Tottenham Hotspur, defender Alfie Mawson said. Soccer Football - Premier League - Huddersfield Town vs Swansea City - John Smith’s Stadium, Huddersfield, Britain - March 10, 2018 Swansea City's Tammy Abraham in action with Huddersfield Town’s Rajiv van La Parra Action Images via Reuters/Ed Sykes Swansea, who had forward Jordan Ayew sent off in the 11th minute of Saturday’s game for a challenge on midfielder Jonathan Hogg, defended with resilience to secure a goalless draw as Huddersfield failed to convert any of their 29 shots. “We were so proud to earn the point. We thrived off the result and celebrated like it was a win,” the 24-year-old English defender told the club’s website (www.swanseacity.com). “We can now go into the FA Cup full of confidence and look to deliver another result... a result like that can drive us on.” Swansea have been rejuvenated under manager Carlos Carvalhal who took over from Paul Clement in December. They have climbed out of the relegation zone and sit 14th in the league table with 31 points and eight games remaining in the season. After the FA Cup clash at the Liberty Stadium, Carvalhal’s side return to league action with a trip to Old Trafford to face Manchester United on March 31.
