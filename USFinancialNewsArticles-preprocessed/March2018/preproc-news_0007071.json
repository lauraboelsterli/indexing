    "text": "ELBA, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The National Security Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:NSEC) today reported net income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 of $669,000 and a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $1,203,000.

The moderate decrease in premium revenue is primarily attributable to a 5.5% increase in catastrophe reinsurance cost.\nNet Income (Loss):\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company had net income of $669,000, $0.26 income per share, compared to a net loss of $104,000, $0.04 loss per share, for the same period in 2016, an increase of $773,000. Adversely impacting our fourth quarter 2017 earnings was an increase in income tax expense of $803,000 from the recognition and revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities due to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). However, a significant decline in catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016 contributed to the improvement in net income for the quarter. Net of tax, fourth quarter 2017 reported losses and loss adjustment expenses (LAE) from catastrophe losses totaled $290,000, compared to $2,995,000 (net of reinsurance) in the fourth quarter of 2016. Hurricane Matthew, which struck the Atlantic Coast impacting our policyholders in Georgia and South Carolina, was the primary contributor to our elevated level of catastrophe losses in 2016.\nFederal Income Taxes:\nOn December 22, 2017, the President signed the TCJA, a comprehensive tax legislation which, among other things, will reduce the Company's statutory federal income tax rate from 34% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. In addition to the reduction in tax rates, the TCJA makes broad and complex changes to the Internal Revenue Code that will introduce changes to many tax related exclusions, deductions and credits. While most provisions of the TCJA do not take effect until 2018, the Company has recognized the tax effects of the enacted legislation on deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the fourth quarter of 2017. The recognition of the impact of the TCJA on deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in an increase in income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $803,000.\nPretax Income (Loss) from Operations:\nA primary non-GAAP financial measure utilized by management is pretax income (loss) from operations. This measure consists of net income (loss) before income taxes adjusted for realized investment gains and losses. This measure provides a means of comparing the results of our core operations without the impact of items that are more unpredictable and less consistent from year to year. A reconciliation of pretax income (loss) from operations is presented in the table above.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company had pretax income from operations of $2,194,000 compared to a pretax loss from operations of $664,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $2,858,000. The primary reason for improvement in pretax income from operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 was a significant decline in weather related losses in our property and casualty subsidiary. As mentioned previously, in the fourth quarter of 2016, the P&C segment had an increase in catastrophe related claims from Hurricane Matthew which decreased pretax income by $4,000,000, net of reinsurance.\nP&C Segment Combined Ratio:\nA measure used to analyze our P&C subsidiaries underwriting performance is the GAAP based combined ratio. Maintaining a combined ratio below 100% indicates the Company is making an underwriting profit. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, the P&C segment had a combined ratio of 83.7%. The fourth quarter of 2017 had a reduced severity level of catastrophe losses compared to 2016 with two catastrophe events adding 10.5 percentage points to the P&C segment combined ratio. In comparison, the P&C segment ended the fourth quarter of 2016 with a combined ratio of 104.1% with catastrophe losses from two cat events contributing 32.9 percentage points to the combined ratio. Hurricane Matthew was the primary factor leading to the elevated fourth quarter 2016 combined ratio.\nYear ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016:\nPremium Revenue:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net premiums earned were down $235,000 at $61,163,000 compared to $61,398,000 in 2016. The decrease in premium revenue is primarily attributable to a 5.5% increase in catastrophe reinsurance cost.\nNet Income (Loss):\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company had a net loss of $1,203,000, $0.48 loss per share, compared to net income of $3,063,000, $1.22 income per share, for the same period in 2016, a decrease of $4,266,000. The primary reason for the decline in 2017 year to date earnings compared to 2016 was the adverse impact of losses incurred from Hurricane Irma coupled with an increase in frequency and severity of catastrophe losses in early 2017 from a very active spring storm season. Net of tax, our reported losses and LAE from 26 catastrophe events in 2017 totaled $9,425,000 compared to 20 cat events in 2016 totaling $6,430,000 after reinsurance recoveries. Also adversely impacting 2017 year to date earnings was a fourth quarter charge to income tax expense of $803,000 from the net impact of recognition and revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to enactment of the TCJA.\nPretax Income (Loss) from Operations:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our pretax loss from operations was $1,348,000 compared to pretax income from operations of $3,096,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $4,444,000. The primary reason for the pretax loss from operations in 2017 compared to the prior year was an increase in the frequency and severity of catastrophe related claims in the P&C segment. In addition to Hurricane Irma, which occurred in September of 2017, our property and casualty subsidiary was impacted by numerous tornado and severe thunderstorm related catastrophe events in the first half of 2017.\nP&C Segment Combined Ratio:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the P&C segment had a GAAP combined ratio of 102.3%. Reported claims from Hurricane Irma coupled with 25 additional severe weather events in 2017 totaled $14,280,000 and increased the P&C segment combined ratio by 25.7 percentage points. In comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2016, the P&C segment had a GAAP combined ratio of 94.6%. Hurricane Matthew reported claims, net of reinsurance, along with non-hurricane cat event claims totaled $9,742,000 and increased the P&C segment combined ratio 17.5 percentage points. The P&C segment ended 2016 with reported claims from 20 catastrophe events.\nManagement Commentary on Financial Position\nSelected Balance Sheet Highlights December 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\n(UNAUDITED) Invested Assets $ 114,731,000 $ 113,156,000 Cash $ 6,644,000 $ 7,368,000 Total Assets $ 146,438,000 $ 148,579,000 Policy Liabilities $ 76,674,000 $ 76,174,000 Total Debt $ 15,639,000 $ 17,126,000 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income $ 2,646,000 $ 1,007,000 Shareholders' Equity $ 47,625,000 $ 48,052,000 Book Value Per Share $ 18.88 $ 19.09 Invested Assets:\nInvested assets as of December 31, 2017 were $114,731,000 up $1,575,000, or 1.4%, compared to $113,156,000 as of December 31, 2016. Although invested assets increased in 2017 compared to 2016, growth of invested assets was adversely impacted by reduced cash flow from operations primarily attributable to the increase in weather related claims in the P&C segment.\nCash:\nThe Company, primarily through its insurance subsidiaries, had $6,644,000 in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017, not materially different compared to $7,368,000 at December 31, 2016.\nTotal Assets:\nTotal assets as of December 31, 2017 were $146,438,000 compared to $148,579,000 at December 31, 2016. Asset growth was hampered in 2017 by increased catastrophe losses in the P&C segment.\nPolicy Liabilities:\nPolicy liabilities were $76,674,000 at December 31, 2017 compared to $76,174,000 at December 31, 2016; an increase of $500,000 or 0.7%. The primary reason for the increase in policy liabilities in 2017 compared to the same period last year was a $839,000 increase in life segment accident and health and life loss reserves. Life segment loss reserves were up 2.3% in 2017 compared to 2016. While the property and casualty subsidiary had a significant increase in reported claims early in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to Hurricane Irma, over 95% of Hurricane Irma claims were settled by December 31, 2017.\nDebt Outstanding:\nTotal debt at December 31, 2017 was $15,639,000 compared to $17,126,000 at December 31, 2016. Debt was reduced $1,487,000 during 2017. The improvement of balance sheet strength through both capital growth and reduction of debt continues to be a primary focus of management.\nShareholders' Equity:\nShareholders' equity as of December 31, 2017 was $47,625,000, down $427,000 compared to December 31, 2016 Shareholders' equity of $48,052,000. Book value per share was $18.88 at December 31, 2017, compared to $19.09 per share at December 31, 2016, a decrease of $0.21. Despite the adverse impact of Hurricane Irma along with a record amount of retained catastrophe losses reported in our P&C segment during the current year, the Company had only a 1.1% decrease in book value per share and a minimal 0.9% decrease in Shareholders' Equity at December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. The primary factors contributing to the decrease in Shareholders' equity was a net loss of $1,203,000, shareholder dividends of $504,000 and new shares issued under our director compensation plan which totaled $76,000. Partially offsetting these factors was an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $1,204,000. The increase in accumulated other comprehensive income was primarily driven by increases in market values of available-for-sale investment securities.\nThe National Security Group, Inc.
