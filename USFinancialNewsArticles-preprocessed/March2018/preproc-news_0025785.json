The Shi’ite militias, which control the nearby villages of Nubl and Zahraa, recently assumed control of the position in agreement with the Kurdish YPG militia — the stated target of a Turkish offensive in the Afrin region, the commander said. The air strike also wounded two Kurdish fighters. Reporting by Dahlia Nehme; Editing by Tom Perry",
