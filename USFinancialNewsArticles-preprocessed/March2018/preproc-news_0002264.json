    "text": "NAPLES, Fla., Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:BBGI) (“the Company”), a large- and mid-size market radio broadcaster, announced today that its Board of Directors approved an 11.1 percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend to $0.05 per share of its Class A and Class B common stock beginning with the dividend declared for the first quarter of 2018. The dividend is payable on Friday, April 6, 2018, to shareholders of record on Friday, March 30, 2018.\nCaroline Beasley, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “The increase in Beasley’s cash dividend reflects the Board’s commitment to creating value for shareholders and our success over the past year integrating the Greater Media properties into our platform. Our expanded operating scale and ongoing leverage reduction combined with the recurring benefit from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is resulting in higher free cash flow, enabling us to increase our return of capital to shareholders and continue with our leverage reduction initiatives, while leaving us with the financial flexibility to pursue additional platform building initiatives including select accretive transactions.”\nWhile the Company intends to pay regular quarterly cash dividends for the foreseeable future, all subsequent dividends will be reviewed quarterly and declared by the Board of Directors at its discretion.\nAbout Beasley Broadcast Group\nCelebrating its 57th anniversary this year, Beasley Broadcast Group, Inc., ( www.bbgi.com ) was founded in 1961 by George G.
