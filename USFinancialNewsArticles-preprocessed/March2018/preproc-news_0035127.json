    "text": "NEWPORT NEWS, Va., March 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Huntington Ingalls Industries (NYSE:HII) announced today that Jeanne Callahan has been named corporate vice president, internal audit, and that David “Chip” Wasson has been named corporate vice president, corporate strategy. Both promotions are effective immediately, and both report to Chris Kastner, executive vice president, business management, and chief financial officer.\nCallahan has served as director, business management, contracts and government compliance, since HII formed in 2011. In her new position, she will be responsible for maintaining an effective internal audit program that provides independent and objective evaluation of company processes and control systems. This includes the development and execution of an audit plan that assesses the company’s operational effectiveness using enterprise risk-based methodology. Callahan began her career as an associate auditor at Newport News Shipbuilding in 1991. She was promoted to manager, strategic planning, in 1997 and worked in cost and financial planning, treasury, operations finance, and contracts before being promoted to director, contracts administration, in 2007. She earned a bachelor’s degree in commerce at the University of Virginia and an MBA at the College of William and Mary.\n“Jeanne’s long record of leadership, grounded in an acute understanding of HII’s business management practices, makes her an ideal choice for this position,” Kastner said. “I’m excited to work with her and the Board of Directors in maintaining and improving HII’s audit function.”\nWasson previously served as director, corporate strategy. He joined HII in January 2017 and has been responsible for evaluating and pursuing business development initiatives and potential acquisition opportunities. In his new position, he is responsible for business strategy and development, including the development and integration of strategic planning efforts, as well as the analysis and entrance into new adjacent markets. Wasson has extensive experience in the defense industry, advising companies in the sector as a senior investment banker and consultant, as well as other executive corporate positions. He earned a bachelor’s degree in economics from the U.S. Naval Academy and an MBA from Vanderbilt University.\n“Chip is an energetic and motivating leader who has made a quick mark at HII,” Kastner said. “I know that under his direction the strategy and development team will continue creating value for our customers, shareholders and employees.”\nPhotos of Callahan and Wasson are available at: http://newsroom.huntingtoningalls.com/releases/leadership-callahan-wasson .\nHuntington Ingalls Industries is America’s largest military shipbuilding company and a provider of professional services to partners in government and industry.
