To earn the bonus, members must then make a fuel transaction at a participating BP station that earns MileagePlus award miles. Limit one bonus per account, per person for a maximum of 200 bonus miles. MileagePlus award miles accrued, awards, and benefits issued are subject to the rules of the United MileagePlus program. For details, visit www.united.com/mileageplus .\n**Driver Rewards members who select United MileagePlus award miles as their reward type in their account will earn 1 award mile per gallon of BP fuel purchased at participating BP locations. Link a form of payment to your Driver Rewards account to earn 1 additional award mile per gallon of regular or mid-grade fuel purchased (for a total of 2 miles per gallon), or earn 2 additional award miles per gallon of premium-grade fuel purchased (for a total of 3 miles per gallon). Maximum 20 gallons per fuel purchase. Member must enter their Driver Rewards number or swipe a linked card at the pump. Not valid with other offers earning or redeeming cents off per gallon. Not valid where prohibited by law. MileagePlus miles accrued, awards, and benefits issued are subject to the rules of the MileagePlus program. For details, visit www.united.com/mileageplus . If you are an existing Driver Rewards member and choose to earn miles, your existing cents per gallon balance will convert to miles as a one-time courtesy at the rate disclosed at the time of conversion. If you choose to make the one-time conversion, the transaction is non-reversible and can only occur one time per person, per Driver Rewards account.\n***Use 60 United MileagePlus award miles per gallon for $0.50 off per gallon on a maximum of 20 gallons (for a maximum of $10 off) per fuel purchase. To be eligible to use miles at participating BP stations, you must have an eligible form of payment linked to your Driver Rewards account and have at least 1,200 miles in your MileagePlus account at the time of purchase.
