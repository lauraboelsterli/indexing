    "text": "U.S. stocks whipsawed on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve upgraded its economic outlook and increased interest rates.\nThe Dow Jones industrial average briefly traded 250 points higher before holding just 60 points higher. The S&P 500 gained as much as 0.8 percent before trading 0.2 percent higher. The Nasdaq composite declined 0.1 percent after gaining as much as 0.6 percent.\n\"The initial reaction in the equity market was positive I think because they didn't add a fourth hike\" this year. said Brian Nick, chief investment strategist at Nuveen. But then the market realized that there was another hike forecast for 2019, Nick noted.\nThe Fed raised overnight rates by 25 basis points , in line with market expectations. Central bank officials also raised their GDP forecast.\n\"The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months,\" the committee said in its post-meeting statement, a sentence that had not been in previous releases. \"Job gains have been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low.\"\nLucas Jackson | Reuters Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Fed officials also released their projections for the federal funds rate, which remained unchanged for 2018. The central bank, however, raised its 2019 forecast, saying it sees the benchmark rate at 2.9 percent , up from a 2.7 percent projection released in December.\nIn the statement, Chair Jerome Powell \"delivered what the market was expecting, albeit with a more hawkish tone,\" said Randy Anderson, chief economist at Griffin Capital. \"I think they've overstated the economic strength for 2019. What they're doing is looking in the rear-view mirror to the Trump administration's tax and infrastructure policies, which can boost GDP in the short term, but can also lead to increases in debt and deficits. Those can put a short circuit in the economy.\"\nTreasury yields briefly rose after the Fed announcement. The benchmark 10-year yield broke above 2.9 percent before retreating to trade at 2.887 percent. The two-year yield also slipped from a nine-year high.\nBank stocks rose following the statement's release. The SPDR S&P exchange-traded fund (KBE) traded 0.7 percent higher, while shares of Citigroup, J.P. Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo all rising.\nWall Street also zeroed in on Powell's first news conference as chair, which started at 2:30 p.m. ET.\nIn corporate news, Facebook shares bounced off the week's lows with a 2 percent gain as some top investors said the recent sell-off reflects a temporary issue. The bounce came after investor Bill Miller told CNBC's Scott Wapner that the stock's valuation is \"too cheap.\"\nThe social media giant faces an investor lawsuit after reports emerged alleging that Cambridge Analytica, an analytics company, had gathered data from 50 million Facebook profiles without the permission of its users.\nGeneral Mills, meanwhile, fell nearly 10 percent after the company trimmed its adjusted earnings growth forecast.\nEquities have been under pressure recently as the Trump administration ramps up a protectionist trade agenda. CNBC reported earlier on Wednesday, citing sources, that the White House will announce tariffs cracking down on Chinese theft of intellectual property .\nâ€”CNBC's Jeff Cox contributed to this report.",
