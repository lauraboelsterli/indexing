    "text": "WESTPORT, Conn., Feb. 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Compass Diversified Holdings (NYSE: CODI) (\"CODI,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or the \"Company\"), an owner of leading middle market businesses, announced today its consolidated operating results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nGenerated Cash Provided by Operating Activities of $22.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $81.8 million for the full year 2017, and Cash Flow Available for Distribution and Reinvestment (\"CAD\" or \"Cash Flow\") of $25.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $92.2 million for the full year 2017; Reported net income of $49.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $33.6 million for the full year 2017; Paid a fourth quarter 2017 cash distribution of $0.36 per share on CODI's common shares in January 2018, bringing cumulative distributions paid to $16.0752 per common share since CODI's IPO in May of 2006; Paid a quarterly cash distribution of $0.453125 per share on the Company's 7.250% Series A Preferred Shares in January 2018; Subsequent to year end, announced the upcoming retirement of Alan B. Offenberg and naming of Elias J. Sabo as CODI's Chief Executive Officer, effective May 3, 2018; Completed the accretive platform acquisition of Foam Fabricators, Inc. (\"Foam Fabricators\") subsequent to year-end; and Consummated the add-on acquisition of Rimports Inc. (\"Rimports\") subsequent to year end by CODI's subsidiary Sterno Products, LLC (\"Sterno Products\").\n\"During 2017 we continued to successfully execute our proven investment strategy, generate strong cash flow and provide sizable distributions to our shareholders,\" said Alan Offenberg, CEO of Compass Diversified Holdings. \"We consummated the accretive platform acquisition of Crosman Corporation, expanding our branded consumer businesses, while continuing to reinvest in our subsidiaries by completing three attractive add-on acquisitions. Complementing this success, we monetized our remaining interest in Fox Factory Holding Corp., which increased CODI's realized gains to over $770 million.\"\nElias Sabo, CODI's CEO-elect, stated, \"We commenced 2018 by completing the platform acquisition of Foam Fabricators, a leading designer and manufacturer of custom molded protective foam solutions that has a strong management team, a diversified customer base, strong free cash flow, and attractive growth prospects. This accretive platform acquisition, combined with our add-on acquisition of Rimports for Sterno Products, strengthens our family of niche leading businesses and positions CODI to continue growing cash flow to a level that meaningfully covers our distribution. Going forward, we will continue to use our considerable financial strength for compelling platform acquisitions as well as add-on acquisitions to accelerate the growth of our subsidiaries.\"\nOperating Results\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, CODI generated Cash Provided by Operating Activities of $22.5 million, as compared to Cash Provided by Operating Activities of $50.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. CODI reported Cash Flow (see Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures below) of $25.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $24.6 million for the prior year's comparable quarter. CODI's weighted average number of shares outstanding for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were 59.9 million and 55.5 million, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, CODI generated Cash Provided by Operating Activities of $81.8 million, as compared to Cash Provided by Operating Activities of $111.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. CODI reported Cash Flow of $92.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $76.4 million for the prior year. CODI's weighted average number of shares outstanding for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017 was approximately 59.9 million, as compared to approximately 54.6 million for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016.\nCODI's Cash Flow is calculated after taking into account all interest expense, cash taxes paid and maintenance capital expenditures, and includes the operating results of each of our businesses for the periods during which CODI owned them. However, Cash Flow excludes the gains from monetizing interests in CODI's subsidiaries, which have totaled over $770 million since going public in 2006.\nNet income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $49.1 million, as compared to net income of $2.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2017, CODI recorded an income tax benefit of $38.7 million primarily related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 which lowered the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. During the fourth quarter of 2016, CODI realized a net gain of $15.8 million related to its equity investment in its former subsidiary Fox Factory Holding Corp. (\"FOX\"). During the first quarter of 2017, the Company sold its remaining shares in FOX in a secondary public offering.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, CODI reported net income of $33.6 million. This compared to net income of $56.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of a $74.5 million gain on CODI's investment in FOX.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, CODI had approximately $39.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, $560 million outstanding on its term loan facility and $42 million in outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility. The Company has no significant debt maturities until 2019 and had net borrowing availability of $507.4 million at December 31, 2017 under its revolving credit facility.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Distributions\nOn January 4, 2018, CODI's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") declared a fourth quarter distribution of $0.36 per share on the Company's common shares (the \"Common Shares\"). The cash distribution was paid on January 25, 2018 to all holders of record of Common Shares as of January 18, 2018. Since its IPO in May of 2006, CODI has paid a cumulative distribution of $16.0752 per common share.\nThe Board also declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.453125 per share on the Company's 7.250% Series A Preferred Shares (the \"Preferred Shares\"). The distribution on the Preferred Shares covered the period from and including October 30, 2017, up to, but excluding, January 30, 2018. The distribution for such period was paid on January 30, 2018 to all holders of record of Preferred Shares as of January 15, 2018.\nConference Call\nManagement will host a conference call on Thursday, March 1, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. ET to discuss the latest corporate developments and financial results.

A number of CODI's businesses have seasonal earnings patterns. Accordingly, the Company believes that the most appropriate measure of its performance is over a trailing or expected 12-month period. We have reconciled CAD, or Cash Flow, to Net Income and Cash Flow from Operating Activities on the attached schedules. We consider Net Income and Cash Flow from Operating Activities to be the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to CAD, or Cash Flow.\nAbout Compass Diversified Holdings (\"CODI\")\nCODI owns and manages a diverse family of established North American middle market businesses. Each of its current subsidiaries is a leader in its niche market.\nCODI maintains controlling ownership interests in each of its subsidiaries in order to maximize its ability to impact long term cash flow generation and value.
