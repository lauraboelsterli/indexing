    "text": "SKOPJE (Reuters) - Thousands of flag-waving protestors in the Macedonian capital on Sunday chanted“We are Macedonians” at a rally to protest a possible change to the name of the former Yugoslav republic to comply with a demand by Greece.\nA boy holds a flag depicting the Vergina Sun during a rally against the use of the term \"Macedonia\" in any settlement to a dispute between Athens and Skopje over the former Yugoslav republic's name, in Athens, Greece, February 4, 2018. REUTERS/Costas Baltas The protestors organized by the We are Macedonia movement gathered under the statue of Hellenic ruler Alexander the Great in Skopje’s main square.\n“We are here because questions about the name, the identity, the constitution (and) language are issues over which we must adopt a (strong) position,” Evica Stojanova-Kamberova, one of rally organizers told the crowd.\nThe small republic and its southern neighbor Greece have agreed to step up U.N.-brokered negotiations this year to solve a decades-old dispute that has hampered Skopje’s ambition to join NATO and the European Union.\nProtesters demanded that the government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev halt talks with Greece over the name dispute. They also want a resolution to the United Nations demanding the country’s recognition under its constitutional name Macedonia.\nProtesters take part in a rally against the use of the term \"Macedonia\" in any settlement to a dispute between Athens and Skopje over the former Yugoslav republic's name, in Athens, Greece, February 4, 2018. REUTERS/Dimitris Michalakis They also accused the government and the main opposition nationalist VMRO-DPMNE party of betraying the national interest.\nGreece objects to the country’s use of the name Macedonia, arguing it implies territorial claims over its own northern region of the same name.\nSlideshow (2 Images) After it split from the former Yugoslavia in 1991, Macedonia was admitted into the United Nations in 1993 under the name Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).\nLast month, Zaev said Macedonia is looking at four options to settle the dispute with Greece that would include a geographical‘qualifier’ to ensure there is a differentiation in the two names.\nMedia reports showed parallel rallies staged by Macedonians abroad in other cities including Washington and Sydney, Australia, where Greek flag and Zaev’s photo were set ablaze.\nReporting by Kole Casule; Writing by Aleksandar Vasovic; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ",
