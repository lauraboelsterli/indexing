    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif. and CLINTON, Conn., March 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- SJW Group (NYSE: SJW) and Connecticut Water Service, Inc. (NASDAQ: CTWS) today announced that both companies' boards of directors have unanimously approved a definitive agreement to combine through a merger of equals to create the 3 rd largest investor-owned water and wastewater utility in the United States, based on pro forma enterprise value and combined rate base.\nThe combined company will have a strong multi-state presence with high-quality and well-run operations, and constructive regulatory relationships in California, Connecticut, Maine and Texas. It will serve more than 1.5 million people with over 700 employees. In addition to expanding its market presence, the increased scale and more diverse geographic footprint of the new organization provide the opportunity for investments in service and reliability that can enhance value for shareholders as well as for customers and communities. The combined company would have had operating revenue of approximately $496 million and recurring net income of $74 million based on a 2017 pro forma basis.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Connecticut Water shareholders will receive 1.1375 shares of SJW Group common stock for each share of Connecticut Water common stock they own, the equivalent of $61.86 per share, or about $750 million in the aggregate, based on SJW Group's closing stock price as of March 14, 2018, and the agreed upon exchange ratio. Following closing of the transaction, SJW Group shareholders will own approximately 60 percent of the combined company, and Connecticut Water shareholders will own approximately 40 percent, on a fully diluted basis. Based on each company's closing share price as of March 14, 2018 and the 1.1375x transaction exchange ratio, the combined company would have a pro forma $1.9 billion equity value and a $2.6 billion enterprise value.\nEric W. Thornburg, President and Chief Executive Officer of SJW Group, said, \"This transformational merger of equals joins two leading and complementary water utility companies to create significant long-term benefits for shareholders, customers, employees and the communities we serve. The combination will establish a premier organization with substantial opportunities for new investment across a diverse set of geographies and an improved ability to serve our customers.\"\nMr. Thornburg continued, \"Having worked closely with the teams at both SJW Group and Connecticut Water, I know that we both share a passion for delivering life-sustaining water service to families and communities, serving our colleagues, being good stewards of the natural resources entrusted to us and creating shareholder value through prudent capital deployment. I am confident we have a strong cultural fit and that our people will build a unified team well-positioned to drive future growth.\"\nDavid C. Benoit, President and Chief Executive Officer of Connecticut Water, said, \"In addition to delivering a premium of 18 percent to Connecticut Water shareholders, this compelling combination honors our unique public health mission and entrepreneurial vision. Together, we create a new larger, stronger company capable of delivering greater value and benefits for our shareholders, customers, employees and communities than either company could deliver on its own.\"\nMr. Benoit continued, \"The new company's combined leadership team is closely aligned in their focus on a 'culture of service' and honoring each company's strong record of environmental stewardship. We intend to carry forward the best practices from both companies to ensure we deliver on our commitments to our shareholders, customers, employees and communities, and realize the substantial value of our unique combination.\"\nStrategic and Financial Benefits of the Merger\nHighly attractive earnings accretion for SJW Group and Connecticut Water shareholders. The combination is expected to be accretive to each company's standalone earnings per share in the first fiscal year post-closing, increasing to mid- to high-single digit accretion in earnings per share over the next couple of years. Robust balance sheet enhances financial flexibility to increase growth. The combined company is expected to benefit from a robust balance sheet and enhanced financial flexibility, with total assets of $2.4 billion. This will result in a stronger financial foundation and increased capital markets access yielding a lower cost of capital, which will better enable the new organization to compete for attractive growth opportunities on a national level. Strong credit profile supports share repurchase. Given the incremental debt capacity resulting from the merger and the expectation that the combined company will maintain a strong \"A\" credit profile, the new company expects to pursue a share repurchase program of up to $100 million, subject to the closing of the transaction, market conditions and Board approval at the time. Continuing a stable and growing dividend. Upon closing and subject to market conditions and Board approval at the time, the new company is expected to establish a dividend at least equivalent to SJW Group's announced 2018 annual dividend of $1.12 per share. This represents an immediate dividend uplift of approximately 7 percent for Connecticut Water shareholders, when adjusted for the agreed exchange ratio, based on the annualized quarterly cash dividend of $0.2975 per share declared by Connecticut Water on November 9, 2017.\nBoth companies expect to maintain their existing dividend payments until the transaction is completed. SJW Group and its predecessor have paid a common stock dividend for 74 consecutive years, and its annual dividend amount has increased in each of the last 50 years. Connecticut Water has paid quarterly dividends on its common stock without interruption or reduction for 62 years since its founding in 1956, and has increased dividend payments for each of the past 48 years.\nCustomer, Employee, Community Benefits of the Merger\nServing local communities with a passionate, dedicated team of locally-based water professionals. Each of the combined company's operating utilities and their customers will continue to be supported locally by a team of passionate, dedicated employees and existing leaders. They will bring their extensive certifications, operating experience and local knowledge to the communities they serve. Delivering customer benefits. The new organization will maintain the longstanding commitments of SJW Group and Connecticut Water to outstanding customer service, which will be enhanced by sharing of best practices, operational expertise and more extensive resources. There will be no change in customer rates as a result of the merger, and the operating subsidiaries of the combined company will each continue to be subject to oversight by their respective state regulatory commissions for rates and quality of service. Leveraging technology and capital investments. The combined company can cost effectively implement updated customer service tools across Connecticut and Maine utility operations by leveraging leading Information Services and Technology systems that have been established at SJW Group. The new company will honor commitments for approximately $200 million of annual capital investments across its combined operations, including moving forward with the construction of the new surface water treatment facility in Saco, ME. Honoring commitments to employees. Following the close of the transaction, employees will have additional opportunities for career development and geographic mobility as part of a larger, stronger, more diverse organization. The companies do not anticipate any significant changes in employee compensation or benefits packages as a result of the transaction. SJW Group values its trusted union partnerships, and all union contracts will continue to be honored. Maintaining environmental stewardship. Environmental stewardship is a core value for both organizations, given the local nature of the water business. Both companies have been industry leaders in their efforts to promote water conservation and protect the valuable lands and water resources that have been entrusted to them. That focus will continue as the combined company seeks to further reduce its environmental footprint and look for opportunities to improve the sustainability of its business practices. Ongoing support of communities. In addition to retaining dedicated employee teams across its footprint, the new company will maintain strong community ties and participation in community events and organizations. The combined company will continue to focus on supporting economic development with investments in growth, safety and reliability.\nLeadership and Headquarters\nThe combined company will be led by an experienced Board of Directors and leadership team that leverages the strengths and capabilities of its subsidiaries. All utility and operating subsidiaries will continue under existing local leadership and brand names â€“ San Jose Water, SJWTX, Inc., SJW Land Company, Connecticut Water Company, Maine Water Company, Avon Water Company and Heritage Village Water Company.\nUpon closing of the transaction, the Board of Directors of the combined company will consist of 12 directors, with seven directors appointed by SJW Group and five directors, including the Lead Independent Director, appointed by Connecticut Water.\nEric W. Thornburg will serve as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the newly-merged company. David C. Benoit will serve as President, New England Region, overseeing the New England operations, including Connecticut Water. In addition, Andrew R. Gere will continue serving as President and Chief Operating Officer of San Jose Water, Thomas Hodge will continue serving as President of SJWTX, Inc. and Richard Knowlton will continue serving as President of Maine Water Company. James Lynch will serve as Chief Financial Officer of the newly combined company, Kristen Johnson will serve as Chief Human Resource Officer, Suzy Papazian will serve as General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, Andrew Walters will serve as Chief Administrative Officer and Maureen Westbrook will serve as Senior Vice President of External Affairs.\nThe combined company's headquarters will be located in San Jose, CA, with the New England headquarters located in Clinton, CT.\nTiming and Approvals\nThe transaction, which is expected to close by year-end 2018, is subject to customary closing conditions and approvals, including the approval of the issuance of shares in the transaction by SJW Group stockholders, the approval of Connecticut Water shareholders, the approvals of the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority and the Maine Public Utilities Commission, the approval of the Federal Communications Commission, and the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.
