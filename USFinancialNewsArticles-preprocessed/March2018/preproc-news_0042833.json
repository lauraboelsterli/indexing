    "text": "\nThe menu at Barclay Prime in Philadelphia boasts luxurious ingredients you would expect of a high-end steakhouse: wagyu ribeye, foie gras and truffled cheese. \nWhat you might not expect is that those ingredients are used in the restaurant's Philly cheesesteak. \nThe Barclay Prime Cheesesteak sells for $120 and is the most expensive in America, according to a new episode of CNBC's \" Secret Lives of the Super Rich .\" \nThis dinner special is no ordinary sandwich. Executive Chef Mark Twersky starts with waygu, a famously tender Japanese beef. The meat costs $75 per pound and is guaranteed with a certificate of authenticity. \n\"This is the money right here, this is the A5 waygu beef,\" Twersky says. \"It's so rich and flavorful.\" \nHe adds the beef to a sesame roll with foie gras mousse and truffle butter, adding a few extra truffles for good measure. CNBC | Secret Lives of the Super Rich \nThen the sandwich is laden with the Italian Caciotta al Tartufo cheese, which is a blend of cow's milk, sheep's milk and truffles, an opulent upgrade from the usual American slices or provolone. CNBC | Secret Lives of the Super Rich \nVisitors to Barclay Prime who order the dish are also served a half bottle of champagne to pair with the sandwich. \n\"The guests that do have it, hands down are blown away,\" says Twersky. \"[They] always say they never imagined they'd have a cheese steak that tasted like this.\" CNBC | Secret Lives of the Super Rich \nPhiladelphia resident and wealth manager Frankie Frederico is one such guest. He tells CNBC's \"Secret Lives of the Super Rich\" he's ordered the cheese steak over 30 times. \n\"The second I tried it, I was absolutely hooked,\" he says. \"Right when you take that first bite in ... your mouth just gets all these different flavors, it's out of this world.\" ",
