    "text": "BEVERLY HILLS, Calif., March 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TOMI Environmental Solutions, Inc. (“TOMI”) (OTCQX:TOMZ), a global provider of infection prevention and decontamination products, services and research, including SteraMist ™ , a hydrogen peroxide-based mist and fog registered as Binary Ionization Technology ® (BIT ™ ) with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) for use as a hospital-healthcare disinfectant, and general disinfectant including C. diff, h1n1, norovirus, salmonella and MRSA, announced its results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nTOMI ™ Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Halden Shane, stated: “We have made great progress on several of our initiatives in 2017, including expanding our registrations and patents both in the U.S. and abroad, increasing personnel in key operational departments and adding manufacturing representatives and distributors across the globe, all to reinforce brand awareness, improve marketing strategies and enhance the position of SteraMist ™ as the most innovative and disruptive disinfection and decontamination technology currently on the market. We are today in a better position than we were at this time last year. We are still an emerging company and, notwithstanding that our results quarter over quarter may be inconsistent, we continue to make good progress and I believe we will continue to increase market penetration and expansion of our product in 2018.”\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nNet revenue in 2017 was $4,994,000, compared to $6,343,000 in 2016. The decrease in revenue relates to product mix in sales as there was an increase in reoccurring solution orders in 2017 and less of a concentration in equipment sales that carry a higher sales price. Gross margin was 61.4% in 2017, compared to 58.9% in 2016. Our gross profit margins increased in 2017 as a result of product and customer mix in sales. Loss from operations in 2017 was approximately $3,444,000, compared to $3,369,000 in 2016. Net loss in 2017 was $3,640,000, or $0.03 on a per share basis, compared to a net loss in 2016 of $3,157,000, or $0.03 on a per share basis. The primary reason for the increased loss relates to reduced other income recognized in the prior period and interest expense incurred in the current period. At December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were $4,550,000 and working capital was $9,070,000 compared to $948,000 and $5,716,000, respectively, at December 31, 2016. The increase in our cash position and working capital relates to the $6,000,000 that was raised in March and April of 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nNet revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1,484,000, compared to $1,816,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in revenue relates to product mix in sales as there was an increase in reoccurring solution orders in 2017 and less of a concentration in equipment sales that carry a higher sales price. Gross margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 58.9%, compared to 60.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our gross profit margins decreased in the current period as a result of product mix in sales. Loss from operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was approximately $1,281,000, compared to $606,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016. The primary reason for the increase in the loss from operations relates to higher research and development costs and non-cash equity compensation expense that was incurred in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1,344,000, or $0.01 on a per share basis, compared to a net loss in the fourth quarter of 2016 of $606,000, or $0.01 on a per share basis. The increased loss relates to the higher loss from operations and interest expense incurred in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nBusiness Highlights from 2017\nCompletion of a $6.0 million private placement, the proceeds from which TOMI ™ will use to expand its sales force, further research and development efforts, expand domestic and international product registrations, enhance marketing and public relation initiatives and amend TOMI’s ™ BIT ™ EPA label.
