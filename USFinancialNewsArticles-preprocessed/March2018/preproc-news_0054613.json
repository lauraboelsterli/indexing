    "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany’s Opel on Tuesday said it will start offering voluntary buyouts to staff as a way to improve the competitive position of its German operations.\nFlags with the Opel logo are seen at the Opel headquarters in Ruesselsheim, Germany November 9, 2017. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski “Step by step, we are building a sustainable future for our company in Germany through enhanced competitiveness like we are doing currently across Europe,” Opel Chief Executive Michael Lohscheller said in a statement.\nOpel’s works council last week demanded “constructive proposals” from parent PSA ( PEUP.PA ) after German sites were excluded from a sweeping investment plan, pending the outcome of further talks with labour representatives.\nOpel said it wanted to avoid compulsory redundancies and factory closures.\nReporting by Edward Taylor; Editing by Arno Schuetze\n ",
