    "text": "PRAGUE, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The proportion of non-residents holding Czech state domestic bonds decreased further to 37.77 percent in January from 41.64 percent in December, Finance Ministry data showed on Wednesday.\nInvestors jumped into Czech bonds last year on bets the crown would gain after the central bank released it from a currency cap, which it ended last April. It has followed up with three interest rate hikes since August.\nForeigners held a record 51.35 percent of domestic bonds in September and their share has been decreasing since then.\nThe crown is 5.8 percent stronger against the euro since the cap was removed.
