    "text": "Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Ryan Cohen to Step Down\nSumit Singh, Chief Operating Officer to Serve as CEO\nPHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PetSmart, Inc. (“PetSmart”) today announced that Ryan Cohen, the co-founder and chief executive officer of Chewy.com has decided to step down from his day-to-day role as CEO.\nChewy.com (“Chewy”) will be led by Sumit Singh, current chief operating officer of Chewy, who joined the company in August 2017 from his role as Director of Amazon Fresh Worldwide. Mr. Singh will be supported by Chewy’s strong management team as the company continues to operate largely as an independent subsidiary of PetSmart, focusing on its current business strategy.\n“Ryan is an amazing leader who has built a unique and powerful ecommerce business with a strong culture that is laser-focused on serving the needs of customers and their pets. I have full confidence that this will continue under the leadership of Sumit, a seasoned ecommerce leader who is well equipped to carry Chewy’s strategy forward and grow the company,” said Raymond Svider, a managing partner at BC Partners and executive chairman of PetSmart. “We have enjoyed a great relationship with Ryan and respect his desire to step back from running the company after the relentless pace of the last seven years; he has our unwavering support and we wish him well.”\nRyan Cohen commented, “The past 7 years have been a tremendous journey and the learning experience of a lifetime. In a short time span, Chewy has gone from a concept to disrupting and redefining an entire industry. I feel the time is right for me to pass on the torch so I can pursue personal goals and spend time with my family. I’m confident in Sumit and believe he will continue to carry on the vision of making Chewy the best and biggest pet retailer on the planet.”\nSaid Sumit Singh, new CEO of Chewy, “We will remain focused on Chewy’s founding vision, core values, operating principles and goals. Our business momentum remains strong as we continue to scale while improving our customers’ experience and lowering our costs. We will stay focused, keep moving forward and continue with our vision of making Chewy the best pet retailer on the planet.”\nMr. Singh has served as the chief operating officer of Chewy.com since November 2017. Prior to Chewy, Mr. Singh served as the Director of Amazon Fresh. Previously, Mr. Singh worked for Dell, Inc. He received his M.B.A. from the University of Chicago, Booth School of Business and an M.S. in Operations and Logistics from the University of Texas at Austin.\nAbout PetSmart\nPetSmart, Inc. is the largest specialty pet retailer of services and solutions for the lifetime needs of pets.
