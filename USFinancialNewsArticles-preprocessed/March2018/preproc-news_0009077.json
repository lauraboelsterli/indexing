(NYSE:XRM):\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nQ4 2017 net sales of $122.4 million compared to $113.2 million in 2016, an increase of 8% (see Table 1). Q4 2017 operating income of $9.6 million, compared to $8.8 million in 2016, an increase of 8%. Q4 2017 net loss of $(9.6) million compared to Q4 2016 net loss of $(8.9) million. Q4 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $22.7 million, compared to $20.4 million in 2016, an increase of 11% (see Table 3 and Table 5 and “ ” below). Q4 2017 GAAP operating cash flow of $25.8 million, capital expenditures of $(1.8) million and proceeds on asset sales of $1.8 million resulted in free cash flow of $25.8 million (see Table 6 and “ ” below). Total debt at December 31, 2017 was $508.9 million compared to $523.8 million at September 30, 2017. Net debt declined to $504.7 million, or 5.0x adjusted EBITDA at December 31, 2017 from $527.9 million, or 5.4x adjusted EBITDA at the end of Q3 2017. (see Table 7 and “ ” below).\nFull Year Highlights\nFull year 2017 net sales of $481.0 million compared to $471.3 million in 2016, an increase of 2% (see Table 2). Full year 2017 operating income of $54.8 million compared to $46.1 million in 2016, an increase of 19%. Full year 2017 net loss of $(14.6) million improved over the 2016 full year loss of $(21.6) million. Full year 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $100.2 million compared to $95.3 million in 2016, an increase of 5% (see Table 4 and Table 5 and “ ” below). Full year 2017 GAAP operating cash flow of $24.7 million, capital expenditures of $(13.0) million and proceeds on asset sales of $2.5 million resulted in free cash flow of $14.2 million (see Table 6 and “ ” below).\nXerium Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:XRM), a leading global provider of industrial consumable products and services, today reported fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.\nMark Staton, President and Chief Executive Officer said, “2017 was a solid year of improvement in operating results, driven by market success of our growth initiatives and supported by improved end-market stability. Higher sales combined with greater organizational focus and improved execution enabled full-year adjusted EBITDA growth of 5%. Discipline and focus also led to impressive fourth quarter free cash generation in excess of $25 million.”\nStaton continued, “Looking to the year ahead, we see a continuation of the improved end-market environment, which coupled with lower cash restructuring and global cash tax requirements positions the company to meaningfully execute on its debt reduction plans in 2018.”\nQuarterly Consolidated Results\nQ4 net sales were $122.4 million, an increase of 5.0% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. The increase was largely due to a 14.0% increase in roll sales related primarily to stronger volumes in North America and Europe. Q4 machine clothing sales were down 0.8%, at constant currency rates, as negative product and customer mix was partially offset by improved sales volume. Order backlogs are down 2% to $168.6 million from Q4 2016 but up 1% from Q3 2017. Table 1 summarizes Q4 net sales and the effect of currency translation rates.\nQ4 2017 gross profit was $44.1 million, or 36.1% of net sales, compared to $41.9 million, or 37.1% of net sales, in Q4 2016. Rolls and service gross margin increased to 33.5% in Q4 2017, from a gross margin of 31.4% in Q4 2016. The increase was primarily due to production efficiencies in North America. Machine clothing gross margin declined to 37.9% in Q4 2017 from 40.6% in Q4 2016. The decline in machine clothing gross margin was primarily due to unfavorable product and customer mix and negative overhead absorption as inventory levels were reduced from a temporary build up earlier in the year.\nSG&A expenses (including Selling, G&A and R&D expenses) were $30.2 million, or 24.6% of net sales, in Q4 2017, versus $30.9 million, or 27.3% of net sales, in Q4 2016. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily attributable to savings achieved through the Company’s cost-out initiatives.\nQ4 2017 basic loss per share was $(0.58) versus Q4 2016 of $(0.55), due to higher restructuring costs and tax expense, partially offset by improved operating performance.\nGAAP operating income in Q4 2017 was $9.6 million, or 7.8% of net sales, an increase of 8.5% compared to Q4 2016 operating income of $8.8 million, or 7.8% of net sales. Q4 2017 adjusted EBITDA improved 11.3% to $22.7 million, or 18.6% of net sales, compared to $20.4 million, or 18.0% of net sales in 2016. In addition to interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA excludes expenses related to the Company’s restructuring activities, plant start-up costs, stock based compensation, unrealized foreign currency gains and losses and certain non-recurring expenses. For a full reconciliation, refer to Table 5.\nCash taxes were $1.2 million in Q4 2017. Full year 2017 cash taxes were $9.7 million. Cash taxes are primarily impacted by income the Company earns in tax-paying jurisdictions relative to income it earns in non-tax-paying jurisdictions, primarily the United States. The Company expects the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted at the end of 2017, to be cash neutral in 2017. Going forward, while the benefit of corporate interest deductions will be limited, the Company will begin to utilize its historic U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and the effects will remain cash neutral into the mid-2020s.\nThe Company generated GAAP operating cash flow of $25.8 million and free cash flow of $25.8 million during Q4 2017. Net debt was $504.7 million at the end of Q4 2017 compared to $527.9 million at the end of Q3 2017 (see Table 7 for a reconciliation to total debt). The Company’s net debt leverage ratio decreased from 5.4x at the end of Q3 2017 to 5.0x at December 31, 2017. The Company plans to utilize its free cash flow to pay down debt and de-lever over the remainder of its debt maturities.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company will discuss the current industry outlook, as well as company specific factors that will drive its expected 2018 results on its live conference call, which will be available for replay at www.xerium.com/investor-relations .\nCONFERENCE CALL\nThe Company plans to hold a conference call this evening:\nDate: February 28, 2018 Start Time: 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time Domestic Dial-In: +1-844-818-4921 International Dial-In: +1-484-880-4582 Conference ID: 1394069 Webcast: www.xerium.com/investor-relations\nTo participate on the call, please dial in at least 10 minutes prior to the scheduled start.

Management of the Company uses supplementary non-GAAP measures, including EBITDA, free cash flow, net debt and adjusted EBITDA, internally to assist in evaluating its liquidity and financial and operational performance. Therefore, the Company believes these non-GAAP measures may also be useful to investors and financial analysts. EBITDA and free cash flow are specifically used in evaluating the ability to service indebtedness and to fund ongoing capital expenditures. Net debt presents a view of the overall change in leverage from quarter to quarter. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items the Company does not believe to be indicative of on-going business trends in order to better analyze historical and future business trends on a consistent basis. EBITDA, free cash flow, net debt and adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), net cash (used in) provided by operating activities or total debt.\nFor additional information regarding non- and a reconciliation of such measures to the most comparable financial measures under GAAP, please see the applicable tables within this press release. In addition, the information in this press release should be read in conjunction with the corresponding exhibits, financial statements and footnotes contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 28, 2018 and our presentation that will accompany our conference call this evening.\nNET SALES\nTable 1 and Table 2 summarize Q4 and full year 2017 net sales and the effect of currency translation rates.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, adjusted EBITDA, as defined and calculated below, may not be comparable to similarly titled measurements used by other companies.\nConsolidated net income (loss) is defined as net income (loss) determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP; provided, however, that the following, without duplication, shall be excluded in determining consolidated net income (loss): (i) any net after-tax extraordinary or non-recurring gains, losses or expenses (less all fees and expenses relating thereto), (ii) the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, (iii) any fees and expenses incurred during such period in connection with the issuance or repayment of indebtedness, any refinancing transaction or amendment or modification of any debt instrument, in each case and (iv) any cancellation of indebtedness income.

These risks and uncertainties include the following items: (1) we may not realize the financial performance we are projecting; (2) our expected sales performance and our backlog of sales may not be fully realized; (3) our cost reduction efforts, including our restructuring activities, may not have the positive impacts we anticipate; (4) our plans to develop and market new products, enhance operational efficiencies and reduce costs may not be successful; (5) market improvement in our industry may occur more slowly than we anticipate, may stall or may not occur at all; (6) variations in demand for our products, including our new products, could negatively affect our revenues and profitability; (7) our manufacturing facilities may be required to quickly increase or decrease production, which could negatively affect our production facilities, customer order lead time, product quality, labor relations or gross margin; and (8) the other risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this press release, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed on February 28, 2018 and our other SEC filings. If any of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from what we projected. Any forward-looking statement in this press release reflects our current views with respect to future events. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to publicly update or revise these for any reason, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. As discussed above, we are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties related to current economic conditions, and we encourage investors to refer to our SEC filings for additional information. Copies of these filings are available from the SEC and in the investor relations section of our website at www.xerium.com .\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180228006284/en/\nXerium Technologies, Inc.\nCliff Pietrafitta\nChief Financial Officer\nInvestor relations line: 919-526-1444\nSource: Xerium Technologies, Inc.",
