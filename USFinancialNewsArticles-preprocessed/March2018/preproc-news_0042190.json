    "text": "0 COMMENTS In his review of Mark Whitaker’s “Smoketown” ( Books, March 10 ), Gerald Early praises the extraordinary cultural achievements of both Pittsburgh’s “Smoketown” and New York’s Harlem. But did the emphasis on culture come at the expense of economic development within the black community?\nOscar Charleston, player-manager of the Pittsburgh Crawfords, standing outside Crawford Grill No. 1, ca. 1937. Photo: Getty Images In 1992 the prominent black historian David Levering Lewis thought that Harlem’s African-American leaders neglected business in favor of the arts. In his comparison of the black and Jewish experience, he identified neglect: “Unlike their Jewish models, . . . the Afro-American leaders tended to minimize or ignore the grimy aspects of migrant Jewish business success as a basic condition for the perpetuation of collective achievement.” He continued with specifics: “Hence, the Harlem Renaissance literally took place in rented space—in a Harlem they did not own. Racial aristocrats steeped in liberal-arts education, they missed the significance of the butcher and tailor shops, the sweatshop, the pawn shop and the liquor stores.”\nGene Dattel\nLakeville, Conn.",
