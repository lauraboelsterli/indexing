The logo of Qualcomm is seen during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 27, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman The letter, which was dated Sunday, said that Broadcom “took a series of actions in violation” of a previous order from Treasury. Broadcom has been seeking to merge with Qualcomm, which has sought to fend off the takeover. Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama",
