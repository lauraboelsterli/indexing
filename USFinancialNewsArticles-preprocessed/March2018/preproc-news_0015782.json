Continued diversification and expansion of FlexShopper.com’s e-commerce marketplace with the addition of retailers such as Walmart, Overstock.com and Amazon. Diversified marketing by creating an automated pay per click advertising platform utilizing campaign segmentation and machine learning bid adjustments.

Continued to grow a loyal customer base that repeats by providing great value and customer service.\nManagement Commentary\nBrad Bernstein, CEO, stated, “We closed 2017 with excellent momentum as we reported top line revenue growth of 41%, driven by year over year lease origination increases. Our 2017 holiday season saw FlexShopper hit new records for monthly originations. In 2017, we maintained a discipline of achieving our targeted customer acquisition cost which resulted in a significant reduction in marketing costs from $10.2 million in 2016 to $6.1 million in 2017. Our underwriting and marketing enhancements combined to drive growth and narrow our losses.”\nMr. Bernstein continued, “Looking ahead to 2018, we are pursuing a number of key initiatives which we expect to drive value for our shareholders. I am excited to have our first earnings call on March 9 and provide greater visibility into some of the growth initiatives we have planned for 2018, which are all designed to scale FlexShopper to profitability and penetrate our large market opportunity.”\nFLEXSHOPPER, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 2016 Revenues: Lease revenues and fees $ 65,412,131 $ 46,513,235 Lease merchandise sold 1,634,233 1,066,350 Total revenues 67,046,364 47,579,585 Costs and expenses: Cost of lease revenues, consisting of depreciation and impairment of lease merchandise 31,453,246 22,734,553 Cost of lease merchandise sold 998,800 687,991 Provision for doubtful accounts 19,135,207 13,281,242 Marketing 6,094,330 10,193,052 Salaries and benefits 7,862,714 5,946,401 Other operating expenses 7,664,566 5,064,869 Total costs and expenses 73,208,863 57,908,108 Operating loss (6,162,499 ) (10,328,523 ) Interest expense including amortization of debt issuance costs 2,168,262 1,925,184 Net loss (8,330,761 ) (12,253,707 ) Cumulative dividends on Series 2 Convertible Preferred Shares 2,316,396 1,211,964 Net loss attributable to common shareholders $ (10,647,157 ) $ (13,465,671 ) Basic and diluted (loss) per common share: Net loss $ (2.01 ) $ (2.57 ) Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic and diluted 5,290,944 5,249,476\nFLEXSHOPPER, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 ASSETS CURRENT ASSETS: Cash $ 4,968,915 $ 5,412,495 Accounts receivable, net 4,259,468 2,181,787 Prepaid expenses 321,035 361,777 Lease merchandise, net 21,415,322 18,570,460 Total current assets 30,964,740 26,526,519 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, net 2,948,164 2,540,514 OTHER ASSETS, net 95,722 88,591 $ 34,008,626 $ 29,155,624 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY CURRENT LIABILITIES: Current portion of loan payable under credit agreement to beneficial shareholder\nnet of $118,404 of unamortized issuance costs $ 14,094,096 $ -

Adjusted Gross Profit provides us with an understanding of the results from the primary operations of its business. The Company uses Adjusted Gross Profit to evaluate its period-over-period operating performance.
