    "text": "Crude prices rose on Monday along with the U.S. stock market on forecasts for robust oil demand growth and concerns OPEC will not be able to increase its production capacity.\nBrent futures were up $1.22, or 1.9 percent, at $65.59 a barrel by 12:43 p.m. EST, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were up $1.27, or 2.1 percent, at $62.53.\nOil prices, which were flat earlier in the day, started rising at about the same time as stocks on the S&P 500 Index at around 10:15 a.m., two energy traders said, noting the stock index turned positive near 11 a.m.\nAnalysts also said prices were being propped up by \"bullish comments\" from oil ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other global oil players at the CERAWeek conference in Houston, the largest energy industry conference, on Monday.\nAbhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energys Global Gas Analytics in London, said comments about \"Venezuela's deteriorating oil-production profile, together with prospects for strong compliance with the OPEC-led output-cut agreement, (were) supportive of oil prices.\"\nshow chapters ",
