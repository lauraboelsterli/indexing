    "text": "BIRMINGHAM, England (Reuters) - Frenchman Kevin Mayer and Canadian Damian Warner face a race to the finish for gold in the final event of a thrilling heptathlon competition at the world indoor championships on Saturday.\nAthletics - IAAF World Indoor Championships 2018 - Arena Birmingham, Birmingham, Britain - March 3, 2018 Canada’s Damian Warner and Kevin Mayer of France after their Men’s 60m Hurdles Heptathlon heat REUTERS/Phil Noble With the 1,000 meters event remaining in the evening session, just 34 points separate leader Mayer from his rival.\nThat translates to about three seconds over the distance, with Warner projected to win by one point from Mayer if both replicate their personal bests.\nSuch a nail-biting finish did not look possible going into the pole vault, the final event of the morning session which Mayer was expected to dominate.\nWhile the 26-year-old Frenchman failed to repeat his personal best of 5.60, eventually going out at 5.10 after clearing 5.00 at the first attempt, Warner beat his previous best mark by 30 centimeters to register 4.90.\nThat left Warner on 5,437 points, trailing Mayer on 5,471, with Germany’s Kai Kazmirek in bronze position on 5,388.\nMayer went into the event as clear favorite but has insisted throughout this competition that the key to winning is enjoying the competition, not dwelling on the pressure.\nAthletics - IAAF World Indoor Championships 2018 - Arena Birmingham, Birmingham, Britain - March 3, 2018 Canada’s Damian Warner competes during the Men’s Pole Vault Heptathlon REUTERS/Phil Noble That was at its most intense in the 60m hurdles early on Saturday when Mayer lined up alongside accomplished sprinter Warner. Predictably, the 28-year-old Canadian won easily.\nAlongside him, the strain on Mayer’s face was clear, but he stayed in Warner’s slipstream to record a creditable 7.83.\nAthletics - IAAF World Indoor Championships 2018 - Arena Birmingham, Birmingham, Britain - March 3, 2018 Kevin Mayer of France competes during the Men’s Pole Vault Heptathlon REUTERS/Phil Noble The fact that Warner made mistakes by hitting the first two hurdles cost him the overall lead going into the pole vault.\nOn the first day, Mayer recorded personal bests in the 60m and long jump, which is his weakest event, to offset a moderate high jump. That gave him a 45-point overnight lead.\nThe result will go some way to settling the argument about who is the true heir to American Ashton Eaton, the multi-discipline competitor who denied Mayer decathlon gold at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games as he retained his London crown.\nMayer won the world title in London last year, but this time Warner has simply refused to let his opponent get away.\nNow Mayer will have to do the same if he is to deny Warner in what could be an epic finale.\nReporting by Neil Robinson; Editing by Ken Ferris\n ",
