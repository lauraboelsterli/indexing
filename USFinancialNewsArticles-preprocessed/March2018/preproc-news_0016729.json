The charge represents the difference between the carrying values and the redemption prices of the redeemed Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock.\nAdditional Items\nCommercial Real Estate\nSubstantially all of RSO's $1.3 billion CRE loan portfolio comprised floating rate senior whole loans at December 31, 2017.\nRSO's CRE whole loan portfolio had a weighted average spread of 4.71% over the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") of 1.56% at December 31, 2017.\nThe following table summarizes RSO's CRE loan activities and fundings of previous commitments, at par, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 (in millions, except percentages):\nThree Months\nEnded\nDecember 31,\n2017 Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 New CRE whole loans funded $ 204.4 $ 528.9 New unfunded loan commitments 24.6 71.4 Total CRE whole loan fundings and commitments 229.0 600.3 Payoffs (1)(2) (185.5 ) (525.2 ) Previous commitments funded 4.0 31.6 Principal paydowns (0.2 ) (34.3 ) New unfunded loan commitments (24.6 ) (71.4 ) CRE whole loans, net funded $ 22.7 $ 1.0 Weighted average one-month LIBOR floor on new originations 1.20 % 0.97 % Weighted average spread above one-month LIBOR 4.26 % 4.41 % Weighted average unlevered yield, including amortization of origination fees 5.79 % 5.71 % (1) CRE loan payoffs and extensions resulted in $949,000 and $3.0 million of exit and extension fees during the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively.\n(2) Activity does not include legacy CRE loans classified as assets held for sale.\nCommercial Mortgage-Backed Securities\nRSO acquired commercial mortgage-backed securities (\"CMBS\") with total face values of $77.7 million and $212.0 million during the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively.\nCMBS acquired during the year ended December 31, 2017 had a weighted average coupon of 3.63%.\nRSO's CMBS portfolio had a carrying value of $211.6 million and a weighted average coupon of 4.35% at December 31, 2017.\nDiscontinued Operations\nPursuant to the Plan, the assets and liabilities of Primary Capital Mortgage, LLC (\"PCM\") and RSO's middle market lending segment, NEW NP, LLC, were reclassified to held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2016 and are reported as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, PCM sold its remaining mortgage servicing rights portfolio and a portion of its loans held for sale generating total proceeds of $20.4 million, of which $15.3 million had been received in cash at December 31, 2017. PCM recognized a net loss of $4.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, including a $1.3 million net realized loss on these sales.\nAt December 31, 2017, the remaining four middle market syndicated loans, with an aggregate carrying value of $27.3 million, were current with respect to contractual payments due, and the one remaining directly originated middle market loan, with a carrying value of $2.0 million, was extended to facilitate a sale of the borrower. The middle market portfolio generated net income of $784,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nLiquidity\nAt February 28, 2018, RSO's liquidity consisted of two primary sources:\nunrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $200.4 million; and\n$160.7 million and $95.3 million available under two term financing facilities to finance CRE loans.\nCommon Stock Book Value and Total Stockholders' Equity\nThe following table reconciles RSO's common stock book value from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 (in thousands, except per share data):\nTotal\nAmount Per Share\nAmount Common stock book value at December 31, 2016 (1) $ 434,211 $ 14.17 Net income allocable to common shares 5,677 0.18 Change in other comprehensive income: Available-for-sale securities (2,403 ) (0.08 ) Derivatives 619 0.02 Common stock dividends (6,166 ) (0.20 ) Common stock dividends on unvested shares (107 ) — Accretion (dilution) from additional shares outstanding at December 31, 2017 (2) 3,561 (0.02 ) Non-cash GAAP discount on the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes issuance 14,231 0.46 Repurchase of conversion option on extinguished convertible notes (194 ) (0.01 ) 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes offering costs (385 ) (0.01 ) Purchase of non-controlling interest (1,410 ) (0.05 ) Total net increase 13,423 0.29 Common stock book value at December 31, 2017 (1)(3) $ 447,634 $ 14.46 (1) Per share calculations exclude unvested restricted stock, as disclosed on the consolidated balance sheets, of 483,073 and 400,050 shares at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The convertible senior notes' discounts will be amortized into interest expense over the remaining life of each note issuance. At December 31, 2017, book value excluding this item would have been $433.5 million, or $14.01 per common share.\nTotal stockholders' equity at December 31, 2017, which measures equity before accounting for non-controlling interests, was $671.5 million, of which $223.8 million was attributable to preferred stock.

Resource Capital Corp. securities class action litigation, under which all claims of the plaintiff class would be released in exchange for settlement consideration of $9.5 million, excluding legal fees, substantially all of which would be funded by insurance proceeds. Consummation of the settlement is subject to various customary conditions that are not guaranteed to occur, including court approval.\nOn February 23, 2018, the consolidated complaint in the In Re Resource Capital Corp. Shareholder Derivative Litigation Demand Refused Actions, which consolidates three shareholder derivative suits against certain current and former officers and directors, was dismissed, but remains subject to the plaintiffs' appeal rights.\nInvestment Portfolio\nThe following table summarizes the amortized cost and net carrying amount of RSO's investment portfolio at December 31, 2017, classified by asset type (in thousands, except percentages):\nAt December 31, 2017 Amortized\nCost Net Carrying\nAmount Percent of\nPortfolio Weighted\nAverage\nCoupon Core Assets: CRE whole loans (1) $ 1,290,150 $ 1,284,822 80.02% 6.09% CMBS (2) 210,806 211,579 13.18% 4.35% Total Core Assets 1,500,956 1,496,401 93.20% Non-Core Assets: ABS (2) 259 158 0.01% N/A (10) Structured notes (3) 2,891 178 0.01% N/A (10) Syndicated corporate loans held for sale (4) 13 13 —% N/A (10) Investment in an unconsolidated entity (5) 10,503 10,503 0.65% N/A (10) Direct financing leases (6) 886 151 0.01% 5.66% Life settlement contracts (7) 5,130 5,130 0.32% N/A (10) Residential mortgage loans held for sale (7) 1,913 1,913 0.12% 3.92% Middle market loans held for sale (7)(8) 41,199 29,308 1.83% 5.06% Legacy CRE loans held for sale (7)(9) 63,341 61,841 3.85% 1.64% Total Non-Core Assets 126,135 109,195 6.80% Total investment portfolio $ 1,627,091 $ 1,605,596 100.0% (1) Net carrying amount includes an allowance for loan losses of $5.3 million at December 31, 2017.\n(2) Classified as investment securities available-for-sale on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(3) Classified as investment securities, trading on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(4) The fair value option was elected for syndicated corporate loans held for sale.\n(5) Classified as investments in unconsolidated entities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(6) Net carrying amount includes an allowance for lease losses of $735,000 at December 31, 2017.\n(7) Classified as assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(8) Net carrying amount includes the lower of cost or market value adjustments of $11.9 million at December 31, 2017.\n(9) Net carrying amount includes a lower of cost or market value adjustment of $1.5 million at December 31, 2017.\n(10) There are no stated rates associated with these investments.\nSupplemental Information\nThe following schedules of reconciliations and supplemental information at December 31, 2017 are included at the end of this release:\nSchedule I - Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income (Loss) to Core Earnings;\nSchedule II - Summary of Securitization Performance Statistics;\nSchedule III - Strategic Plan Update; and\nSchedule IV - Supplemental Information.\nAbout Resource Capital Corp.\nResource Capital Corp. is a real estate investment trust that is primarily focused on originating, holding and managing commercial mortgage loans and commercial real estate-related debt investments.\nThe Company is externally managed by Resource Capital Manager, Inc.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP NET INCOME (LOSS) TO CORE EARNINGS\n(unaudited)\nRSO uses Core Earnings as a non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate its operating performance. RSO previously used Adjusted Funds from Operations as a non-GAAP measure of operating performance.\nCore Earnings exclude the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that RSO believes are not indicative of its current CRE loan portfolio and other CRE-related investments and operations. Core Earnings exclude income (loss) from all non-core assets, such as Commercial Finance, Middle Market Lending, Residential Mortgage Lending, certain legacy CRE loans and other non-CRE assets designated as assets held for sale at the initial measurement date. (1)\nCore Earnings, for reporting purposes, is defined as GAAP net income (loss) allocable to common shareholders, excluding (i) non-cash equity compensation expense, (ii) unrealized gains and losses, (iii) non-cash provisions for loan losses, (iv) non-cash impairments on securities, (v) non-cash amortization of discounts or premiums associated with borrowings, (vi) net income or loss from a limited partnership interest owned at the initial measurement date, (vii) net income or loss from non-core assets, (2) (3) (viii) real estate depreciation and amortization, (ix) foreign currency gains or losses and (x) income or loss from discontinued operations. Core Earnings may also be adjusted periodically to exclude certain one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain non-cash items.\nAlthough pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Management Agreement RSO calculates incentive compensation using Core Earnings excluding incentive fees payable to the Manager, beginning with the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 RSO includes incentive fees payable to the Manager in Core Earnings for reporting purposes.\nCore Earnings does not represent net income or cash generated from operating activities and should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income or as a measure of liquidity under GAAP. RSO's methodology for calculating Core Earnings may differ from methodologies used by other companies to calculate similar supplemental performance measures, and, accordingly, its reported Core Earnings may not be comparable to similar performance measures used by other companies.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation from GAAP net (loss) income allocable to common shares to Core Earnings allocable to common shares for the periods presented (in thousands, except per share data):\nFor the Three\nMonths Ended For the Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net (loss) income allocable to common shares - GAAP $ (12,131 ) $ (9,520 ) $ 5,677 $ (52,956 ) Adjustment for loss on CRE assets — 1,145 — 270 Net (loss) income allocable to common shares - GAAP, adjusted (12,131 ) (8,375 ) 5,677 (52,686 ) Reconciling items from continuing operations: Non-cash equity compensation expense 321 (518 ) 2,738 3,025 Non-cash provision for CRE loan losses 1,254 2,467 1,502 10,464 Unrealized loss (gain) on core activities 667 (732 ) 2,167 — Non-cash amortization of discounts or premiums associated with borrowings 780 414 4,058 1,660 Deferred tax asset valuation allowance (4) — 1,434 — 10,373 Net (income) loss from limited partnership interest owned at the initial measurement date (1) — (440 ) 1,073 (1,025 ) Income tax expense from non-core investments (2)(3) 674 — 6,637 — Net realized gain on non-core assets (2)(3) (1,387 ) — (42,402 ) — Net loss (income) from non-core assets (3) 1,010 (8,196 ) (4,691 ) (17,151 ) Reconciling items from discontinued operations and CRE assets: Net interest income on legacy CRE loans held for sale (71 ) (355 ) (3,323 ) (355 ) Realized loss (gain) on liquidation of CRE loans 103 (2,084 ) (12,386 ) (2,084 ) Asset impairment on CRE securities — (723 ) — 19,930 Fair value adjustments on legacy CRE loans held for sale 1,942 7,719 1,942 7,719 Net (income) loss from other non-CRE investments held for sale (688 ) 113 (974 ) 113 Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes 3,284 6,728 14,116 19,260 Core Earnings before realized loss on CRE assets (4,242 ) (2,548 ) (23,866 ) (757 ) Adjustment for realized loss on CRE assets — (1,145 ) — (270 ) Core Earnings allocable to common shares (5) $ (4,242 ) $ (3,693 ) $ (23,866 ) $ (1,027 ) Weighted average common shares - diluted 30,914 30,618 30,836 30,539 Core Earnings per common share - diluted (5) $ (0.14 ) $ (0.12 ) $ (0.77 ) $ (0.03 ) (1) Initial measurement date is December 31, 2016.\n(2) Income tax expense from non-core investments and net realized gain (loss) on non-core assets are components of net income or loss from non-core assets.\n(3) Non-core assets are investments and securities owned by RSO at the initial measurement date in (i) Commercial Finance, (ii) Middle Market Lending, (iii) Residential Mortgage Lending, (iv) legacy CRE loans designated as held for sale and (v) other non-CRE assets included in assets held for sale.\n(4) Upon making the decision to dispose of the non-core asset classes, RSO re-evaluated its net deferred tax asset, which resulted in a net $10.4 million write down of its valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n(5) Core Earnings include non-recurring charges of $8.5 million, or $(0.28) per common share-diluted, for the year ended December 31, 2017, in connection with the extinguishment of the 6.00% convertible senior notes due 2018 and 8.00% convertible senior notes due 2020, and $3.8 million, or $(0.12) per common share-diluted, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, in connection with the redemptions of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock.\nRSO has five operating segments: Commercial Real Estate Debt Investments; Commercial Finance; Middle Market Lending; Residential Mortgage Lending; and Corporate & Other. The Commercial Real Estate Debt Investments operating segment includes our activities and operations related to commercial real estate loans and commercial real estate-related securities. The Commercial Finance operating segment includes the activities and operations related to syndicated corporate loans, syndicated corporate loan-related securities and direct financing leases. The Middle Market Lending operating segment includes the activities and operations related to the origination and purchase of middle market corporate loans.
