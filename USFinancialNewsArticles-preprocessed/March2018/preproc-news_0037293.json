    "text": "Executives at Cambridge Analytica, a political data firm that worked on digital ads for President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign, were caught on camera suggesting that the firm could use sex workers, bribes, ex-spies and fake news to help candidates win votes around the world, a new investigation has revealed.\nThe U.K.-based firm is at the center of a data breach scandal involving Facebook . \nBritain's Channel 4 News carried out an undercover sting of the company and caught top executives suggesting the tactics.\nThe news channel's reporter posed as a representative of a wealthy Sri Lankan family looking to gain political standing. While executives initially denied they used \"entrapment\", after several meetings with the reporter, they put forward some tactics they could use.\nOne suggestion was to create the scenario of a sex scandal to discredit opponents.\n\"Send some girls around to the candidate's house, we have lots of history of things,\" CEO Alexander Nix said. \"We could bring some Ukrainians in on holiday with us, you know what I'm saying.\"",
