(Nasdaq:RGNX), a leading clinical-stage biotechnology company seeking to improve lives through the curative potential of gene therapy based on its proprietary NAV ® Technology Platform, today announced financial results for the fourth ended December 31, 2017 and recent operational highlights.\n“In 2017, we significantly advanced our AAV gene therapy pipeline, which now consists of 12 active clinical stage programs, including four internal programs, as we seek to improve treatment options using our NAV Technology Platform,” said Kenneth T. Mills, President and Chief Executive Officer of REGENXBIO. “We believe 2018 will be a transformative year for REGENXBIO, as we advance our mission of improving lives through the curative potential of gene therapy and expand our leading AAV gene therapy pipeline with our internal lead product candidates and our NAV Technology Licensees’ programs. We look forward to providing updates on our lead product candidates and our NAV Technology Licensees’ programs throughout the year, and are on track to report topline trial data for RGX-314 for wet AMD and RGX-501 for HoFH by year-end.”\nRecent Operational Highlights\nIn February 2018, REGENXBIO announced the completion of dosing of the third cohort in the Phase I clinical trial for RGX-314 for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). A total of 18 patients have been treated in the clinical trial to date. REGENXBIO expects to present topline data from the RGX-314 clinical trial in late 2018, which will include both primary and secondary endpoint data. In February 2018, REGENXBIO dosed the second patient in the second cohort, and fifth patient overall, with a single administration of RGX-501 in the Phase I/II clinical trial for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). REGENXBIO expects to present topline data from the RGX-501 clinical trial in late 2018, which will include both primary and secondary endpoint data. Site activation is continuing in the Phase I clinical trial evaluating RGX-111 for the treatment of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS I). Patient recruitment is anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2018, with the first patient expected to be dosed in mid-2018. Site activation is continuing in the Phase I/II clinical trial evaluating RGX-121 for the treatment of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II (MPS II). Patient recruitment is anticipated to begin in the first quarter of 2018, with the first patient expected to be dosed in mid-2018. In January 2018, REGENXBIO and AveXis, Inc. announced an amendment to their license agreement for the development and commercialization of treatments for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Under the terms of the amended agreement, REGENXBIO could receive up to $260 million, including an upfront payment of $80 million, $60 million in additional guaranteed annual payments and potential commercial milestone payments of up to $120 million, and AveXis acquired exclusive rights to the entire NAV Technology Platform for the development of treatments for SMA. Additionally, the amended agreement permits assignment by AveXis upon a change of control without REGENXBIO’s consent. In January 2018, REGENXBIO entered into an agreement with FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies which secures access to dedicated cGMP suite capacity and resources capable of manufacturing REGENXBIO’s lead product candidates at up to 2,000L scale in support of global development and commercialization.\nAs of December 31, 2017, REGENXBIO’s NAV Technology Platform was being applied in the development of more than 20 partnered product candidates by 10 NAV Technology Licensees. Eight of these partnered product candidates are in active clinical development. Three recent updates from NAV Technology Licensee active clinical programs include:\nIn January 2018, AveXis announced that it will initiate screening for remaining patients in the pivotal trial of AVXS-101 for SMA Type I following review of preliminary data from the first three patients. AVXS-101 uses the NAV AAV9 vector. In January 2018, Audentes Therapeutics, Inc. announced positive interim data from the first dose cohort in the Phase I/II clinical trial evaluating AT132 for the treatment of X-linked myotubular myopathy. AT132 uses the NAV AAV8 vector. In February 2018, Audentes Therapeutics announced dosing of the first patient in the Phase I/II clinical trial evaluating AT342 for the treatment of Crigler-Najjar Syndrome. AT342 uses the NAV AAV8 vector.\nFinancial Results\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $176.4 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $159.0 million as of December 31, 2016. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2017 exclude the $80 million received from AveXis in connection with the previously announced amendment to the license agreement in January 2018 for the development and commercialization of treatments for SMA.\nRevenues were $2.0 million and $10.4 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to $1.7 million and $4.6 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.\nTotal operating expenses were $18.6 million and $86.3 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to $22.2 million and $69.9 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.\nNet loss was $16.0 million and $73.2 million, or $0.51 and $2.45 net loss per basic and diluted common share, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to $19.6 million and $63.0 million, or $0.74 and $2.38 net loss per basic and diluted share, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2016, respectively.\nFinancial Guidance\nREGENXBIO reiterates that it expects full-year 2018 cash burn to be between $85 million and $95 million, which will support the continued development of its lead product candidate programs. Full-year 2018 cash burn guidance excludes the effect of the upfront payment of $80 million and any other potential consideration that may be received from AveXis in connection with the previously announced amendment to the license agreement in January 2018 for the development and commercialization of treatments for SMA. Subject to this exclusion, full-year 2018 cash burn will be measured as the decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018.\nAbout REGENXBIO Inc.\nREGENXBIO is a leading clinical-stage biotechnology company seeking to improve lives through the curative potential of gene therapy. REGENXBIO’s NAV Technology Platform, a proprietary adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene delivery platform, consists of exclusive rights to more than 100 novel AAV vectors, including AAV7, AAV8, AAV9 and AAVrh10.
