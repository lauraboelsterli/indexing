    "text": "SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MyoKardia, Inc. (Nasdaq:MYOK), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering a precision medicine approach for the treatment of heritable cardiovascular diseases, today announced that it will report fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial and operating results after the U.S. financial markets close on Thursday, March 8, 2018. Management will host a conference call and live audio webcast to discuss these results and provide a business update at 4:30 p.m. ET (1:30 p.m. PT).\nConference Call and Webcast\nTo access the live conference call, please dial 844-494-0193 (domestic) or 508-637-5584 (international) and refer to the conference ID 8496928.\nThe webcast may be accessed live on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at http://investors.myokardia.com . A replay of the webcast will be available on the MyoKardia website for 90 days following the call.\nAbout MyoKardia\nMyoKardia is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering a precision medicine approach to discover, develop and commercialize targeted therapies for the treatment of serious and rare cardiovascular diseases. MyoKardia’s initial focus is on the treatment of heritable cardiomyopathies, a group of rare, genetically-driven forms of heart failure that result from biomechanical defects in cardiac muscle contraction. MyoKardia has used its precision medicine platform to generate a pipeline of therapeutic programs for the chronic treatment of the two most prevalent forms of heritable cardiomyopathy – hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). MyoKardia’s most advanced product candidate is mavacamten (MYK-461), a novel, oral, allosteric modulator of cardiac myosin that has been shown to reduce hypercontractility in early clinical studies and is currently being studied in the Phase 2 PIONEER-HCM clinical trial. MYK-491, MyoKardia’s second product candidate, is designed to increase the overall extent of the heart’s contraction in DCM patients by increasing cardiac contractility. MyoKardia is currently evaluating MYK-491 in a Phase 1b study in DCM patients. A cornerstone of the MyoKardia platform is the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe), a multi-center, international repository of clinical and laboratory data on individuals and families with genetic heart disease, which MyoKardia helped form in 2014. MyoKardia’s mission is to change the world for patients with serious cardiovascular disease through bold and innovative science.\nContacts:\nMichelle Corral\nCorporate Communications & Investor Relations\nMyoKardia, Inc.\n650-351-4690\nmcorral@myokardia.com\nBeth DelGiacco (Investors)\nStern Investor Relations, Inc.\n212-362-1200\nbeth@sternir.com\nSteven Cooper (Media)\nEdelman\n415-486-3264\nsteven.cooper@edelman.com\nSource:MyoKardia, Inc.",
