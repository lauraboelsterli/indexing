    "text": "Don't put all your financial eggs in one investment basket \nIf only there were a way to pinpoint a running summary of available economic statistics that could make sense of it all in just one statistic, one that could provide us with an up-to-the-minute estimate for real U.S. gross domestic product growth. \nThere is. \nThe GDPNow figure , via the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, provides a running estimate of real GDP growth based on available data for the current measured quarter. I'll provide the link below so you can follow along going forward. An observation I'd like to make is that the stats in the front of the quarter have enormous sway over the GDPNow estimate because the data set is limited to just one or two stats. If the first stat of the quarter is strong, then the GDPNow will reflect that strong figure. As the quarter goes by and more stats are input into the model, the more it moderates. If the GDPNow starts the quarter with a high number and sinks into the end of the quarter, then stats are coming in weaker, which may indicate a weakening economy. \nThe first quarter started out strong with a GDPNow print at a high level of 5.4 percent. But after nearly a full quarter's worth of economic statistics, it is now running at a dismal 1.8 percent . \nOne thing missing from that 1.8 percent figure is the earnings outlook for stocks. Companies have been exceptional at generating strong earnings growth in a lightweight GDP environment ever since the end of the Great Recession. Fourth-quarter 2017 showed one of the best earnings growth rates we've seen since then. Now that the recently enacted tax laws have come to pass, it's pretty much a widely accepted forecast that earnings should do well into the end of this year and remain at that level into 2019. \nThat's the good news. But that's also the bad news. A black swan too obvious to see \nStocks don't just trade up on earnings; they trade up on the growth rate of earnings, which in some ways is more important than the actual level of earnings. Without another major push by the government to give the economy another major spending boost or tax cut (there has been talk of a second round of tax cuts by Trump and GOP leaders on Capitol Hill), and without a really strong rebound in GDP outlook, investors should be more inclined to consider whether we have reached peak earnings and act based on the need to cut back on stocks. \nIn other words, as the corporate tax-cut benefits roll off at the end of 2018 and we get into next year's earnings outlook, investors might just have to accept that the earnings outlook for the rest of this year is as good as it gets.

Maybe this year is going to be a three-peat. \nThe Fed thinks so (improving GDP), according to its FOMC meeting statements this week. Its forecast for unemployment rate dives into the mid-3 percent range and raises its inflation forecast. Regardless, it is now prevailing wisdom that a wage boost is coming. That's not good for earnings. Maybe the ever-elusive black swan, something unforeseen, which ends this bull market is that the economy is just running out of steam and it's too obvious to see it. \nFor now, the betting is that GDP will accelerate as 2018 goes on. We'll see soon enough . I know amid all the contradictory signals from the economy, it's the one I will be watching. \nâ€” By Mitch Goldberg, president of investment advisory firm ClientFirst Strategy",
