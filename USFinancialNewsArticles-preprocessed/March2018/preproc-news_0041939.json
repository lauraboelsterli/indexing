(“XpresSpa Group”). Route1 announced the signing of the definitive agreement to acquire Group Mobile (the “Agreement”) on March 8, 2018.\nGroup Mobile , based in Chattanooga, TN and Chandler, AZ, supplies rugged mobile technology solutions to leading automotive manufacturing companies and suppliers, other leading manufacturing and distribution companies, as well as local and state governments in the southeastern and southwestern United States. Route1 is acquiring Group Mobile to:\nExpand Route1’s service and product offerings; Strengthen outside and inside sales; Diversify revenue, customers, and verticals; Expand the use of Route1’s core technologies into the manufacturing, distribution, local and state government and respective suppliers; and Leverage Group Mobile’s current and future placement of rugged mobile devices to sell Route1’s core technologies as an integrated offering.\nUnder the terms of the Agreement, Route1 issued to XpresSpa Group 25 million common shares, and 30 million, three-year common share purchase warrants with an exercise price of CAD 5 cents per common share. XpresSpa Group now owns approximately 7% of Route1’s undiluted common shares.

Specifically:\nAn annual earn-out if the gross profit of Group Mobile is in excess of USD $3,750,000 per 12-month period, then XpresSpa Group will receive 27.5% of the actual gross profit amount greater than USD $3,750,000. If the gross profit target is missed in the first or second year, no subsequent annual earn-out payment(s) will be made; and A cumulative earn-out that is equal to 27.5% of the Group Mobile gross profit for the first 36 months post-closing that is in excess of $11,250,000 less any annual earn-out amounts previously made. Payments pursuant to the annual or cumulative earn-out will be made in cash, 90 days after the respective period end.\nAdditional transaction terms include:\nNo assumption of indebtedness (other than trade payables or accruals incurred in the ordinary course of business). A minimum working capital balance. An XpresSpa Group non-compete and non-solicitation for a period of three years. A voting agreement whereby, if XpresSpa Group owns in excess of 3% of the outstanding shares of Route1, all common shares issued as part of the acquisition are subject to a voting agreement with Route1 for the term of the earn-out.\nInvestor Conference Call and Webcast\nRoute1 will hold a conference call and web cast to discuss the Group Mobile acquisition and provide an update on the AirWatch litigation on Monday, March 26, 2018 at 9 a.m. eastern.
