This market's skittish.\"\nMicron Technology : \"Let's let it come down a little bit. Look, we know from HP that it is having a good quarter, but there's no sweat. You can buy it at $45, I think.\"\nWatch the full lightning round here: show chapters Cramer's lightning round: Nokia has become a good spec.
