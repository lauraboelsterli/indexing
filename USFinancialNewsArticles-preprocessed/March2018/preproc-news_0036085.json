    "text": "TORONTO, March 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Enssolutions Group Inc. (TSXV:ENV.H) (OTC Pink Sheets:NSLSF) (“Enssolutions” or the “Company”), announces today with great sadness that Mr. David Lincoln, a Director and the Company’s majority shareholder, passed away from illness on March 16, 2018. Mr. Lincoln, 92, was first appointed to the Board on June 30, 2012. Enssolutions is a manufacturer and distributor of environmentally responsible emulsion products for a wide variety of industrial and commercial market demands.\nThroughout his distinguished career as a businessman, investor and philanthropist, Mr. Lincoln served as an executive and board member of many companies and was also particularly revered for his involvement in a considerable amount of not for profit activity. Mr. Lincoln also served as a Director and Chairman of the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy and Chairman of Claremont Lincoln University, an on-line university that teaches the skills required in formulating peaceful solutions for controversial or potentially violent situations.\nBelieving that Enssolutions and its products had important potential for environmentally friendly solutions for various private and public commercial enterprises, Mr. Lincoln significantly contributed financially to the sustainability of the Company. Additionally, through his leadership experience, broad business expertise and insights, Mr. Lincoln contributed greatly in the setting of broad objectives and goals for the Company.\nMark Young, Chairman of the Board of Enssolutions stated, “We are deeply saddened to announce David’s passing. David’s wealth of knowledge and expertise, financial support and sage advice and guidance made an invaluable contribution to Enssolutions for which we are forever grateful. Apart from his role as a Director, David was also a wonderful supporter and friend and he will be greatly missed. On behalf of the entire Board of Directors and management of the Company, our thoughts and prayers are with David’s family and friends during this difficult time.”\nIt is the current intention of the Company to continue with a Board of Directors comprised of five members being, Mr. Mark Young (Chairman), Mr. James Griffiths, Mr. John Allen, Ms. Cornelia Molson and Mr. James Staudohar. The Board remains committed to continuing to explore capital raising possibilities and to examine potential growth and other revenue-generating initiatives to assist in sustaining the Company. The Company advises, however, that there can be no assurance that any of such possible transactions will materialize or, if undertaken, there can be no assurance as to their terms or timing.\nAbout Enssolutions\nEnssolutions manufactures, distributes and applies environmentally responsible products to meet a wide variety of industrial and commercial market demands. Enssolutions provides engineered environmental solutions for mine tailings control, process dust and erosion control, granular stabilization, road construction/maintenance and stockpile sealing.
