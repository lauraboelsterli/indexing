    "text": "WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Glytec, the pioneer of personalized digital therapeutics, is pleased to announce the appointment of Ed Furlong as Chief Operating Officer. Furlong joins the company during a period of extraordinary growth and will assume a key leadership role in scaling commercial operations to meet evolving customer needs.\n“We are thrilled to welcome Ed Furlong to our executive team,” says Glytec’s President and CEO, Bob Leonard . “Ed’s background in helping companies expand and diversify while sustaining strong financial health is ideally suited to our strategic imperatives, especially at this crucial juncture when demand for our products and services is increasing exponentially.”\nFurlong’s experience in operations and financial management spans more than 30 years, most recently as Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer at Kyruus, a leader in provider search and scheduling solutions for hospitals and health systems, where he was instrumental in shaping the business model, building the organization and increasing revenues elevenfold. Furlong previously served in a similar capacity at Exa Corporation, maker of engineering simulation and visualization software, where he directed the company’s IPO, raised private equity and mezzanine debt financing, and achieved consistent growth and profitability.\nEarlier in his career, Furlong served as a senior executive in the investment services industry for both Fidelity Strategic Investments and UAM Investment Services, where he spearheaded a wide range of start-ups and turnarounds and participated on several corporate boards. Furlong holds a bachelor of science in economics from The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and a master of business administration from Harvard Business School.\n“It is very exciting for me to join Glytec on the heels of a record year where software subscriptions grew by 70%,” says Furlong. “I am deeply impressed by the company’s track record of demonstrating both substantive cost savings as well as dramatic improvements in patient outcomes. I believe there will soon be some seismic shifts in the market as relate to diabetes care and medication optimization, and I am inspired to be part of a team that partners with healthcare organizations to facilitate real change.”\nAbout Glytec\nGlytec is the pioneer of personalized digital therapeutics, enabling best practices for inpatient and outpatient insulin management.
