    "text": "March 22, 2018 / 3:00 PM / Updated 24 minutes ago Second police officer in hospital after UK spy poisoning - Mail Online Reuters Staff 1   A second police officer is being treated in hospital for suspected poisoning after a chemical attack on a former Russian double agent but the symptoms are minor, the Mail Online reported on Thursday. Prime   blamed   Putin for the incident last week and expelled 23 diplomats from the Russian embassy in a move which was replicated by Moscow. Russia denies any involvement in the attack on ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, who have been critical in hospital since they were found unconscious on March 4 on a bench in the city of Salisbury. London and Wiltshire police had no immediate comment on the Mail Online story when contacted by Reuters. The second police officerâ€™s symptoms include skin irritation, the website said.
