    "text": "SAN DIEGO, March 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRNE) (\"Sorrento\") announced today that it appointed Mr Jiong Shao as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nJiong is an 18-year veteran in investment banking who has held a number of senior positions with several global leading investment banks in both New York and Hong Kong.\nDuring his banking career, Jiong led a number of financing transactions including IPOs in both the New York and Hong Kong capital markets, serving key corporations including Tencent, Alibaba, and Baidu. He helped to raise billions of dollars from investors in support of those companies. Specifically, from 2015 to 2017, Jiong served as Managing Director, Head of China Technology, Internet, and Media (TIM) investment banking at Deutsche Bank in Hong Kong. Prior to that time, from 2010 to 2015, he held various Managing Director positions at Macquarie Capital including Head of China TIM investment banking and Head of pan-Asia TIM research, also in Hong Kong.\nJiong started his investment banking career with Lehman Brothers in New York as an equity research analyst covering global leading technology companies, including Cisco, and he was ranked as a top analyst by institutional investors over multiple years. Jiong holds a Bachelor of Engineering from Shanghai Jiaotong University and an MBA from Duke University.\n“I am excited to join the Sorrento leadership team,” said Mr Shao. “I am impressed by the vision and quality of the team, and I strongly believe its shares are currently substantially under-valued. I look forward to bringing years of investment banking relationships and financial expertise towards building shareholder value in line with the upside potential of its assets in development.”\n“We are pleased to welcome Jiong to our executive management team,” said Dr Henry Ji, Chairman and CEO for Sorrento Therapeutics. “His deep understanding of the global capital markets and institutional investor base, as well as his expertise in executing large size financing transactions will be instrumental to Sorrento’s potential Nasdaq/HSKE dual-listing in the near future.”\nAbout Sorrento Therapeutics, Inc.\nSorrento is a clinical stage, antibody-centric, biopharmaceutical company developing new therapies to turn malignant cancers into manageable and possibly curable diseases.
