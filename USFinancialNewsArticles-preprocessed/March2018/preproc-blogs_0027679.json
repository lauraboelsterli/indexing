The walk is commemorating the 17 students and staff killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida on Feb. 14. The walkout is part of a burgeoning, grass-roots movement that grew out of the Parkland attack. Published 7 Hours Ago Reuters Kevin Lamarque | Reuters Students who walked out of their classes at Montgomery County, Maryland schools, protest against gun violence in front of the White House in Washington, U.S., February 21, 2018. \nU.S. students spilled out of classrooms by the thousands on Wednesday, waving signs and chanting slogans like \"We want change,\" in a coast-to-coast protest against gun violence prompted by a deadly rampage at a Florida high school last month. \nThe #ENOUGH National School Walkout began at 10 a.m. EDT with 17-minute walkouts planned at 10 a.m. in each time zone, though many protests went longer. \nThe protests commemorated the 17 students and staff killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on Feb. 14. The massacre was the latest in a series of shootings that have plagued U.S. schools for nearly two decades. \nSome students got in an early start. At Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School in New York City, crowds of students poured into the streets of Manhattan, many dressed in orange, the color of the gun-control movement. @B_RadWill: Powerful moment in DC with huge crowd of students sitting with their backs to the White House for 17 minutes of silence. # NationalWalkoutDay # Enough \n\"Thoughts and prayers are not enough,\" read one sign, needling the rote response many lawmakers make after mass shootings. At 10 a.m., the hundreds of students sat down on the sidewalk, filling half a city block, and fell silent. \nIn Parkland, thousands of students slowly filed onto the Stoneman Douglas school football field to the applause of families and supporters beyond the fences as law enforcement officers looked on. News helicopters thrummed overhead. \nTy Thompson, the school's principal, called for the \"biggest group hug,\" and the students obliged around the 50-yard line. @AlisonReporting: An early student walkout begins at LaGuardia High School in New York on the anniversary of the Parkland shooting # neveragain # parkland \nStudents at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, joined the movement around 10 a.m. local time. Like most of her friends at Columbine High School, sophomore Abigail Orton had not yet been born when a shooting attack at her school in a Denver suburb left 15 people dead and horrified the country. She joined Wednesday's national student walkout against gun violence to help prevent massacres, such as the one at Columbine in 1999, from happening again. \"I grew up in a community still haunted by the tragedy from 19 years ago. I can see the haunted looks in the eyes of teachers and parents who went through it,\" said the 16-year-old sophomore. \nFew teachers or staff who were present for the April 20, 1999, attack still work at Columbine High, but the man who served as its principal at the time returned on Wednesday in solidarity with the student walkout. Frank DeAngelis, who retired as Columbine's principal in 2004, said he considered the student-led movement \"phenomenal.\" \"If the adults won't do anything about it, they will,\" he said. @Taylorapuckett tweet \nThe walkouts were part of a burgeoning, grassroots movement that grew out of the Parkland attack. Some of the survivors have lobbied state and federal lawmakers, and even met with President Donald Trump, to call for new restrictions on gun ownership, a right protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. \n\"We don't feel safe in schools anymore,\" Sarah Chatfield said. A 15-year-old high school student from Maryland, Chatfield had joined a crowd of hundreds protesting outside the White House, with some sitting silent with their backs turned. \n\"Trump is talking about arming teachers with guns,\" she said. \"That is not a step in the right direction.\" @Ogfhere: #NationalWalkoutDay marching right now! A lot of us wearing orange and orange bracelets to represent the movement! #ENOUGH #NeverAgain @Emma4Change @kerrywashington \nSoon after, some of the students began marching toward Capitol Hill. \"Hey hey, ho ho, the NRA has got to go!\" they chanted, referring to the powerful gun-rights interest group, the National Rifle Association. \nThe Parkland survivors' efforts helped bring about a tightening of Florida's gun laws last week, when the minimum age for buying any kind of gun was raised to 21 years from 18, although lawmakers there rejected a ban on the sort of semiautomatic rifle used in the Parkland attack. \nIn Washington, however, plans to strengthen the background-check system for gun sales, among other measures, appear to be languishing. @ Nathaniel12204 : @ schoolwalkoutUS Our school is going on lockdown and guarding the doors with police officers. Teachers are saying good luck getting out of the school. Because we are teens they assume everything is a joke. # enough # NationalStudentWalkout \nStudents from more than 2,800 schools and groups are joining the walkouts, many with the backing of their school districts, according to the event's organizers, who also coordinated the Women's March protests staged nationwide over the past two years. \nSupport has also come from the American Civil Liberties Union and Viacom Inc, which said all seven of its networks, including MTV, suspended programming on the East Coast during the 17-minute walkout there. \nThe protests took place a day after Florida prosecutors said they would seek the death penalty for Nikolas Cruz, who has been charged with 17 counts of premeditated murder and 17 counts of attempted murder in the Parkland attack. \nThe New York City Department of Education allowed students to participate if they submitted a signed permission slip from their parents. \nBut a few school districts around the country had warned against protests during school hours. \nAdministrators in Sayreville, New Jersey, told students that anyone who walked out of class would face suspension or other punishment, according to myCentralJersey.com . \nIn Bentonville, Arkansas, a high school student was suspended on Tuesday after handing out unauthorized flyers promoting the walkout, local news media reported. Leslee Wright, a spokeswoman for the Bentonville schools, declined to comment on the report, citing laws regarding student confidentiality. But she confirmed that the district board voted 4-3 to enforce its student handbook on Wednesday, which requires detention for students who are absent from school without a doctor's note. \nMore than 40 of U.S. colleges and universities, including Yale, Brown and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have said their admissions offices would not penalize any applicants who may be disciplined for protesting. \n\"I, for one, will be cheering these students on from New Haven,\" Hannah Mendlowitz, an admissions and recruitment official at Yale University, wrote in a blog post in February.",
