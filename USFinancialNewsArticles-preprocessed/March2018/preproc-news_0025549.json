    "text": "Getty Images Andrew McCabe \nAttorney General Jeff Sessions is considering a recommendation to fire former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe and could order his ouster this week, shortly before McCabe's expected retirement, according to a person familiar with the matter. \nMcCabe allegedly wasn't forthcoming with investigators probing the disclosure of information to a Wall Street Journal reporter for an October 2016 story about an inquiry into the Clinton Foundation, said the person. \nMcCabe left his post in January after he was told to step aside, but had been expected to take leftover vacation time until he was eligible to retire this month after a decadeslong career with the agency.",
