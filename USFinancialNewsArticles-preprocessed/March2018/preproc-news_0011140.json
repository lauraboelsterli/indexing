    "text": "MIDDLETOWN, R.I., March 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KVH Industries, Inc., (Nasdaq:KVHI) reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 today. The company will hold a conference call to discuss these results at 10:30 a.m. ET today, which can be accessed at investors.kvh.com . Following the call, a replay of the webcast will be available through the company’s website.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nTotal unit shipments of VSAT products, including AgilePlans products, increased 16% for the quarter.\nAgilePlans, our new Connectivity as a Service Program for the commercial maritime sector, increased to 65% of total commercial VSAT shipments, and unit shipments more than doubled compared to the 2017 third quarter.\nOverall revenue declined 11% in our fourth quarter of 2017 to $39.0 million from $43.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, driven in part by the continuing shift in our business model from hardware sales to a recurring revenue model.\nStrong sales of inertial measurement unit (IMU) products drove fiber optic gyro (FOG) product revenue higher by 18% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, the fourth consecutive double-digit growth quarter.\nmini-VSAT Broadband airtime revenue grew $0.5 million, or 3%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.7 million, or $0.10 per share, compared to a net loss of $6.8 million, or $0.43 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNon-GAAP net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.0 million, or $0.12 per share, compared to $2.2 million, or $0.13 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.8 million, compared to $4.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nWe continued to make progress in our photonic chip development which has now been successfully built into a working gyro prototype.\nCommenting on the quarter, Martin Kits van Heyningen, KVH’s Chief Executive Officer, said “KVH's business model transformation growth continued in the fourth quarter, in line with our expectations, and our momentum is continuing as we enter into 2018. As we continue to move the business from hardware to service revenue, we are particularly pleased with the increasing success of our AgilePlans, Connectivity as a Service Program, as we received more new orders in the fourth quarter than in the previous two quarters combined. The positive trend for AgilePlans has continued into the first quarter of 2018. Our airtime revenue also continued to grow, and we believe the recent launch of our new global HTS network will help to continue that trend. Likewise, our FOG business sustained the robust growth we have been seeing throughout 2017, reporting double digit growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. In addition, we continue to make excellent progress toward the development of a photonic chip-based FOG, which could open new opportunities in the quickly evolving self-driving automotive market. Overall, 2017 was a transformative year for KVH and we are happy with the progress we have made with all of our strategic initiatives.”\nThe company operates in two segments, mobile connectivity and inertial navigation. In the fourth quarter of 2017, unit shipments for our mobile connectivity segment increased significantly, while net sales decreased $1.7 million, or 5%, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease was partly attributed to the launch of our AgilePlans program, since revenues under this program are not recognized initially but instead are recognized over time. Net sales for inertial navigation products decreased $3.2 million, or 29%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease was driven primarily by lower TACNAV orders.\nFinancial Highlights (in millions, except per share data)\nQuarter Ended\nDecember 31, Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 GAAP Results Revenue $ 39.0 $ 43.9 $ 160.1 $ 176.1 Net loss $ (1.7 ) $ (6.8 ) $ (11.0 ) $ (7.5 ) Net loss per diluted share $ (0.10 ) $ (0.43 ) $ (0.67 ) $ (0.47 ) Non-GAAP Results Net income $ 2.0 $ 2.2 $ 1.4 $ 7.0 Net income per diluted share $ 0.12 $ 0.13 $ 0.09 $ 0.44 Adjusted EBITDA $ 3.8 $ 4.3 $ 6.7 $ 15.5 For more information regarding our non-GAAP financial measures, see the tables at the end of this release.\nFourth Quarter Financial Summary\nRevenue was $39.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of 11% compared to $43.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nProduct revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $13.7 million, 26% lower than the prior year quarter, due to a $2.1 million decrease in mobile connectivity product sales and a $2.8 million decrease in our inertial navigation product sales. Mobile connectivity product sales decreased primarily due to a $1.6 million decrease in marine product sales and a $0.5 million decrease in land product sales. The decrease in marine product sales was due to the timing of a particularly large order received in the prior year quarter, as well as the impact of the new AgilePlans subscription service. Inertial navigation product sales decreased due to a $3.8 million decrease in TACNAV sales, due to a large order that was shipped in the prior year quarter. This was partially offset by a $0.9 million increase in FOG product sales.\nService revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $25.3 million, an increase of less than 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 due to a change in service mix. Airtime service revenues, which include mini-VSAT Broadband airtime revenues, increased 3%. Content and training revenues, which include our entertainment, eLearning, and safety content, decreased by 4%, primarily due to a decrease in fleet subscribers. Our engineering service revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased by $0.3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOur operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased $0.3 million year over year to $19.1 million compared to $19.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The key drivers were a decrease in variable compensation of $1.5 million, a decrease in consulting fees of $0.6 million, and a decrease in unfunded engineering expenses of $0.3 million, partially offset by an increase in employee termination and other non-recurring costs of $1.2 million. As these costs are discrete and non-recurring, they have been excluded from our calculation of adjusted EBITDA above.\nFull Year Financial Summary\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, revenue was $160.1 million, a decrease of 9% compared to $176.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Weakness in the British Pound negatively impacted revenue in 2017 by $1.4 million, or 1%. Product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $57.0 million were 22% lower than the prior year, driven primarily by a 21% decrease in mobile connectivity product revenues and a 23% decrease in our inertial navigation product revenues year-over-year.\nService revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $103.1 million, approximately the same as the year ended December 31, 2016. Our mini-VSAT Broadband airtime revenue increased 4%. Engineering service revenue increased 86% principally due to a new project that began in January 2017 and was completed in the third quarter of 2017. Content and training revenues decreased by 9%, however on a constant-currency basis, revenue in those product lines decreased by 5%. British Pound weakness negatively impacted content and training revenues by $1.4 million, or 4% year over year.\nWe reported a GAAP net loss of $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, or $0.67 per share. During 2016, the company recorded a GAAP net loss of $7.5 million, or $0.47 per share. The net loss in 2017 includes $5.8 million of non-cash discrete tax reserves compared to $6.8 million in 2016. We generated non-GAAP net income of $1.4 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $7.0 million, or $0.44 per diluted share reported for the prior year. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $15.5 million in the prior year.\nFirst Quarter 2018 and Full Year 2018 Outlook\nOur guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2018 is below. This guidance reflects the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which all US public companies were required to adopt on January 1, 2018. 2017 was an investment year as we began to transform our business model, and we expect 2018 to return to growth with full year non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA expected to double from last year. Our growth expectations are driven by our continued success in the key strategic priorities that we outlined last year. Our AgilePlans program continues to gain traction in the commercial marine market, and the popularity of our new HTS network is growing. We will also continue to invest in the development of our new photonic chip-based FOG, as well as our portfolio of TACNAV products intended for use in military applications, specifically the US military’s Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing (A-PNT) program. It should be noted that this guidance does not include any revenue from the international pipeline of large orders that we have been anticipating:\n(in millions, except per share data) First Quarter Full Year From To From To Revenue $ 39.0 $ 41.0 $ 166.0 $ 180.0 GAAP EPS $ (0.25 ) $ (0.19 ) $ (0.44 ) $ (0.21 ) Non-GAAP EPS $ (0.07 ) $ (0.03 ) $ 0.12 $ 0.28 Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA $ 0.5 $ 1.5 $ 12.0 $ 16.0\nASC 606 requires that certain revenues that had been recognized in prior periods be reversed as of January 1, 2018 and be recognized over time as performance obligations are met, and, likewise, that certain currently generated revenues that would have been recognized under previous accounting guidance instead be deferred and recognized over time as performance obligations are met. We expect the net impact of this change in accounting guidance, which is reflected in the above tables, will be as follows:\n(in millions, except per share data) First Quarter Full Year Revenue $ (0.5 ) $ (4.0 ) GAAP EPS $ 0.00 $ (0.06 ) Non-GAAP EPS $ 0.00 $ (0.04 ) Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA $ (0.1 ) $ (1.0 ) Other Recent Announcements\nSKY Perfect JSAT Agreed to Invest $4.5 Million in KVH as Part of Strategic Collaboration in Maritime Satellite Connectivity Global Ship Manager E.R. Schiffahrt Chooses KVH HTS Systems and AgilePlans for Vessel Connectivity KVH Announces $8.3 Million in New Orders for Fiber Optic Gyro (FOG) Products and Services KVH Industries Announces Appointment of Chief Marketing Officer and Senior Vice President for Strategy, Elizabeth Jackson SKY Perfect JSAT and KVH to Deliver Maritime Broadband Services\nPlease review the corresponding press releases for more details regarding these developments.\nConference Call Details\nKVH Industries will host a conference call today at 10:30 a.m. ET through the company’s website. The conference call can be accessed at investors.kvh.com and listeners are welcome to submit questions pertaining to the earnings release and conference call to ir@kvh.com . The audio archive will also be available on the company website within three hours of the completion of the call.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis release provides non-GAAP financial information, including constant-currency revenue, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted EPS, and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, as a supplement to our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally in analyzing financial results to assess operational performance. Constant-currency revenue is calculated on the basis of local currency results, using foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the earlier comparative period, and management believes that presenting information on a constant-currency basis helps management and investors to isolate the impact of changes in those rates from other factors. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release adjust for specified items that can be highly variable or difficult to predict. Management generally uses these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate financial and operational decision-making, including evaluation of our historical operating results, comparison to competitors’ operating results, and determination of management incentive compensation. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business.\nSome limitations of non-GAAP net income (loss), non-GAAP diluted EPS, and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, include the following:\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) and diluted EPS exclude amortization of intangibles, stock-based compensation, certain discrete tax items, acquisition-related compensation, employee termination and other non-recurring costs, and other discrete charges.\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest income, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related compensation, employee termination and other non-recurring costs, and other discrete charges.\nOther companies, including companies in KVH’s industry, may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or not at all, which will reduce their usefulness as a comparative measure.\nFuture Non-GAAP Adjustments\nFuture GAAP diluted EPS may be affected by changes in ongoing assumptions and judgments, and may also be affected by non-recurring, unusual or unanticipated charges, expenses or gains, which are excluded in the calculation of our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance as described in this press release.\nBecause non-GAAP financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease our reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review our consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the tables accompanying this release.\nAbout KVH Industries, Inc.\nKVH Industries is a leading provider of innovative systems and solutions for the mobile connectivity and inertial navigation markets.
