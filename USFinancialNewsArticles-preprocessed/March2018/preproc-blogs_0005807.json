    "text": "CNBC.com The Jaguar I-PACE is its first, all-electric vehicle. \nJaguar showed off its first all-electric vehicle today, a SUV called the I-PACE, designed to rival Tesla's Model X and forthcoming electric vehicles like the Audi E-Tron. \nThe company, which is owned by Tata Motors , infused its I-PACE with more than a unique battery pack. The I-PACE will be the first of Jaguar's cars that can receive \"over-the-air\" software updates. \nAdditionally, Jaguar has created an Alexa skill that works in conjunction with its \"Jaguar InControl Remote App\" for the I-PACE. \nThe skill lets drivers check their vehicles remotely, just by asking an Echo, or any other Alexa-enabled device, what's happening while they're away. Is the car locked? Fully charged? Where did I park it? Where's the nearest charging station? \nIn a livestreamed demo on Thursday, Jaguar showed users asking if their car had enough of a charge to get to the office. \nToyota, Lexus and other automakers have integrated Alexa into their vehicles on-board software, as well.",
