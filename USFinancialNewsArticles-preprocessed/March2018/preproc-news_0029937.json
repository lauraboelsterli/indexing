Leader of Italy's far-right League Matteo Salvini attends a news conference at the Foreign Press Club in Rome, Italy March 14, 2018. REUTERS/Tony Gentile Related Coverage “Barring the PD, everything is possible,” Salvini said at Rome’s foreign press club. Slideshow (2 Images) The League is the biggest party in a right-wing coalition including former premier Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia (Go Italy!), which won the most seats at a March 4 election. However, no party or group won an outright majority, leaving Salvini jockeying for power with the 5-Star Movement, which emerged as the biggest individual party. Salvini reiterated his party’s long-held position that the euro was a “flawed currency”, adding: “The only irreversible thing is death, not a currency.” Reporting by Gavin Jones, Writing by Isla Binnie; Editing by Crispian Balmer",
