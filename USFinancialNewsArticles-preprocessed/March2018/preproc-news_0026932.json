    "text": "ATLANTA, March 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HD Supply Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:HDS), one of the largest industrial distributors in North America, today reported Net sales of $5.1 billion for the full-year of fiscal 2017 ended January 28, 2018, an increase of $302 million, or 6.3 percent, as compared to the full-year of fiscal 2016.\n\"I am proud of the team’s performance in 2017. We built momentum throughout the year and ended 2017 in a position of strength,\" stated Joe DeAngelo, Chairman and CEO of HD Supply. \"Much of our success is driven by our hourly associates who work hard every day providing exceptional service to our customers. I am therefore pleased to announce that we are providing our hourly associates with a bonus of up to $1,000 to share in the benefits of the recently enacted tax reform.\"\nGross profit increased $108 million, or 5.6 percent, to $2,033 million for the full-year of fiscal 2017 as compared to $1,925 million for the full-year of fiscal 2016. Gross profit was 39.7 percent of Net sales for the full-year of fiscal 2017, down approximately 20 basis points from 39.9 percent of Net sales for the full-year of fiscal 2016.\nOperating income increased $43 million, or 7.6 percent, to $608 million for the full-year of fiscal 2017 as compared to $565 million for the full-year of fiscal 2016. Operating income as a percentage of Net sales was 11.9% percent for the full-year of fiscal 2017, up approximately 20 basis points from 11.7 percent for the full-year of fiscal 2016.\nNet income increased $774 million, to $970 million for the full-year of fiscal 2017 as compared to $196 million for the full-year of fiscal 2016. The increase in Net income was impacted by a $732 million gain, net of $197 million of tax, on the sale of our Waterworks business unit which was completed in August 2017, partially offset by a $72 million non-cash charge as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Net income per diluted share increased $4.04 to $5.01 for the full-year of fiscal 2017 as compared to $0.97 for the full-year of fiscal 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $51 million, or 7.5 percent, to $731 million for the full-year of fiscal 2017 as compared to $680 million for the full-year of fiscal 2016.

The 2017 fourth-quarter loss was due to a $72 million non-cash charge for the remeasuring of the company’s U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Net loss per diluted share was $0.05 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to a $0.26 Net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $30 million, or 24.6 percent, to $152 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to $122 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.

Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.49 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, as compared to $0.23 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nAs of January 28, 2018, HD Supply’s combined liquidity of $1,232 million comprised of $558 million in cash and cash equivalents and $674 million of additional available borrowings (excluding $235 million of borrowings on available cash balances) under HD Supply, Inc.’s senior asset-backed lending facility, based on qualifying inventory and receivables.\nBusiness Unit Performance\nAs a result of the sale of the Waterworks business, the company began sharing resources between its centralized support functions and its business units. As a result, and to provide better comparability to the company’s industry peers, beginning with the full-year of fiscal 2017 results, all Corporate overhead costs are allocated to the business units. Prior periods presented were revised to reflect the allocation of all Corporate overhead costs. Interest expense, interest income, other non-operating income and expenses, and provision for income taxes are not allocated to the company’s business units. The company does not allocate Corporate assets to its business units. There is no change to the historically reported consolidated financial results.\nFacilities Maintenance\nFull-Year Results\nNet sales increased $85 million, or 3.1 percent, to $2,847 million in the full-year of fiscal 2017, as compared to $2,762 million for the full-year of fiscal 2016.

There were 18 selling days in November, 20 selling days in December and 23 selling days in January. Average year-over-year daily sales growth for November, December and January was 9.8 percent, 10.9 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively.\nAcquisition\nOn March 5, 2018, the company completed its acquisition of A.H. Harris Construction Supplies, a leading specialty construction distributor serving the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions expanding Construction & Industrial’s market presence in the northeastern United States. The cash purchase price was $380 million subject to post-closing working capital adjustments.\nPreliminary February Sales Results\nPreliminary Net sales in February 2018 were approximately $391 million, which represents year-over-year average daily sales growth of approximately 11.7 percent. Preliminary February year-over-year average daily sales growth by business segment was approximately 7.1 percent for Facilities Maintenance and approximately 17.3 percent for Construction & Industrial. There were 20 selling days in both February 2018 and February 2017.\nFiscal Year 2018 and First-Quarter 2018 Outlook\nFor fiscal year 2018, the company estimates end market growth of approximately 2-3 percent. In accordance with our fiscal calendar, fiscal year 2018 is a 53-week year.\nFor first-quarter 2018, the company anticipates Net sales to be in the range of $1,325 million to $1,375 million, Adjusted EBITDA 1 in the range of $174 million to $184 million, and Adjusted net income per diluted share 1 in the range of $0.60 to $0.66. The first-quarter 2018 Adjusted net income per diluted share range assumes a fully diluted weighted average share count of 186 million. At the mid-point of the ranges, our first-quarter 2018 Net sales and Adjusted EBITDA translate into approximately 11 percent growth and 14 percent growth, respectively, versus prior year. The recently acquired A.H. Harris business is contributing approximately $50 million in sales, $5 million in EBITDA and $0.02 in Adjusted net income per diluted share to our estimated first-quarter 2018 results.\nFor the full year of fiscal 2018, Net sales are anticipated to be in the range of $5,760 million and $5,910 million, Adjusted EBITDA1 in the range of $815 million and $855 million and Adjusted net income per diluted share1 in the range of $2.99 and $3.21. The full year of fiscal 2018 Adjusted net income per diluted share range assumes a fully diluted weighted average share count of approximately 186 million. The recently acquired A.H. Harris business is contributing approximately $360 million in sales, $40 million in EBITDA and $0.18 in Adjusted net income per diluted share to our estimated full year fiscal 2018 results.\nThe company will provide further specifics on its end markets, the first-quarter of fiscal 2018 outlook and the full-year of fiscal 2018 outlook during the fourth-quarter of fiscal 2017 earnings conference call and in the earnings call presentation materials.\nFiscal 2017 Fourth-Quarter Conference Call\nAs previously announced, HD Supply will hold a conference call on Tuesday, March 13 th , 2018 at 8:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) to discuss its fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal 2017 results.

We present Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income because each is a primary measure used by management to evaluate operating performance. In addition, we present Adjusted net income to measure our overall profitability as we believe it is an important measure of our performance. We believe the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income enhances investors' overall understanding of the financial performance of our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA is based on \"Consolidated EBITDA,\" a measure which is defined in our senior credit facilities and used in calculating financial ratios in several material debt covenants. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Net income (loss) less Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, plus (i) Interest expense and Interest income, net, (ii) Provision (benefit) for income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization and further adjusted to exclude loss on extinguishment of debt, non-cash items and certain other adjustments to Consolidated Net Income permitted in calculating Consolidated EBITDA under our senior credit facilities.\nAdjusted net income is defined as Net income (loss) less Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, further adjusted for loss on extinguishment of debt, certain non-cash, non-recurring or unusual items, net of tax.\nWe compensate for the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures by using them to supplement GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our interest expense, or the requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our income tax expenses or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted net income do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; and although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Net income (loss) and Income (loss) from Continuing Operations, the most directly comparable financial measures under GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented (amounts in millions):\nThree Months Ended Fiscal Year Ended January 28,\n2018 January 29,\n2017 January 28,\n2018 January 29,\n2017 Net income (loss) $ (9 ) $ 52 $ 970 $ 196 Less income from discontinued operations, net of tax 9 26 803 130 Income (loss) from continuing operations (18 ) 26 167 66 Interest expense, net 31 50 164 269 Provision for income taxes 101 21 193 51 Depreciation and amortization (1) 24 22 90 88 Loss on extinguishment & modification of debt (2) 3 5 84 179 Restructuring charges (3) 3 (7 ) 6 7 Stock-based compensation 7 5 26 20 Acquisition costs (4) 1 — 1 — Adjusted EBITDA $ 152 $ 122 $ 731 $ 680 Depreciation and amortization includes amounts recorded within Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
