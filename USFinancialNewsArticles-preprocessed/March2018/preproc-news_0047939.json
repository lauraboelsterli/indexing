    "text": "(Reuters) - The European Commission pressed Facebook ( FB.O ) on Monday over whether EU citizens’ data were among those improperly used by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, piling pressure on the firm that has lost more than $100 billion in market value in the last 10 days.\nA 3D-printed Facebook logo is seen in front of the logo of the European Union in this picture illustration made in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina on May 15, 2015. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic “I regret that Facebook’s official statements, including those of CEO Zuckerberg, have not alleviated my concerns,” EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova wrote in a letter to Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, seen by Reuters.\nJourova asked the company whether they were certain that a Cambridge Analytica-like scenario could not happen again.\nReporting by Julia Fioretti\n ",
