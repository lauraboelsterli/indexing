It’s not too hot, not too cold, a Goldilocks report,” Alec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell, said.\nWhile higher interest rates are a positive for banks, they can make equities as an asset class broadly less attractive as bond yields rise.\nOther supportive developments included U.S. President Donald Trump’s comments on possible exemptions from import tariffs on steel and aluminium, and that he was prepared to meet North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.\nAmong individual movers, the biggest FTSE gainer was NMC Health, which briefly touched a record high following a well-received trading update.\nThe UAE healthcare provider reported a 38.2 percent rise in annual net profit on Wednesday and said acquisitions this year could top the $641 million it spent in 2017.\nOn the midcap index, Renewi fell 4.3 percent after the waste-to-product company said it would take an impairment charge following the review of contracts in its UK municipal division.\nInmarsat dropped 6.7 percent after a quarterly update which was in line with expectations. Morgan Stanley analysts said comments around its government business were cautious, indicating that consensus expectations for 2019 revenue growth of 5 percent were too high.\nGVC Holdings rose 5 percent after the online gambling firm saw full-year net gaming revenue rise 17 percent in 2017, helped by gains from the bwin.party businesses it bought three years ago. GVC is set to take over Britain’s largest bookmaker Ladbrokes Coral. (Reporting by Danilo Masoni and Kit Rees Editing by Keith Weir)\n ",
