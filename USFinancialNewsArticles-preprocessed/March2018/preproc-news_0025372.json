    "text": "NEW YORK, March 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- WeissLaw LLP is investigating possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law by the Board of Directors of Express Scripts Holding Co. (\"ESRX\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ: ESRX) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by Cigna Corp. (\"CI\") (NYSE: CI). On March 8, 2018, the Company announced a definitive agreement for CI to acquire all outstanding shares of ESRX in a cash-and-stock deal. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company's shareholders will receive $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 of a share of the newly combined company for each ESRX share they own, representing consideration of $96.03 per share.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether ESRX's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, at least one analyst set a target price of $101.00, or nearly $5.00 above the per-share consideration.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether ESRX's Board acted in the best interests of ESRX's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. If you own ESRX shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties. We have recovered over a billion dollars for defrauded clients and obtained important corporate governance relief in many of these cases. If you have information or would like legal advice concerning possible corporate wrongdoing (including insider trading, waste of corporate assets, accounting fraud, or materially misleading information), consumer fraud (including false advertising, defective products, or other deceptive business practices), or anti-trust violations, please email us at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com or fill out the form on our website, http://www.weisslawllp.com/express-scripts-holding-co/\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/weisslaw-llp-investigates-express-scripts-holding-co-acquisition-300612434.html\nSOURCE WeissLaw LLP",
