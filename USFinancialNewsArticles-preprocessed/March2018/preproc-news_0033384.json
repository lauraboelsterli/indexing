    "text": "2 COMMENTS The Chicago landlord of what Apple Inc. calls its “most ambitious store” has put the building on the block in a sales process that will test the power of the popular brand name in a tempestuous retail climate.\nReal-estate private equity firm Walton Street Capital has hired Eastdil Secured to market the Norman Foster-designed Apple Store that opened last fall and has become a popular new attraction along the reinvigorated Chicago River waterfront.\nWalton last year paid $370 million for the Apple Store, which at the time was under development, along with 401 N. Michigan Ave., the 35-story office and retail building next door.\nNow the firm is hoping to sell the 20,000-square-foot Apple Store along with 10,000-square-feet of retail space in the office building for as much as $175 million, according to people familiar with the offering.\nWalton would retain the office space. Real-estate investors often buy mixed-use properties and then split off the valuable retail space and sell it separately.\nEastdil and potential buyers of the Apple Store were having preliminary discussions last week at the global Mipim real estate conference in Cannes, France, according to people at the conference. Eric Mogentale, managing principal of Walton, declined comment.\nThe sale comes at a time when retail real-estate in general is under enormous pressure because of competition from online shopping and the contraction and failure of many big name retailers. Values of many malls and shopping centers have been falling.\nTim Cook, Apple’s CEO, attended the store opening. Photo: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News But Apple Stores have long been the gold standard in the retail world because of the high traffic they attract. Not only do they ring up strong sales, but they also boost traffic and sales at neighboring stores.\nA report by Green Street Advisors in 2016 found that average sales for 220 malls with Apple Stores came to $710 per square foot, compared with $630 per square foot for malls without Apple Stores. The study was based on a database that covered about 1,400 properties.\nApple is well aware of the power of its brand and uses it to negotiate low rents . The rent it is paying for the new Apple Store in Chicago is well below the average $400 to $500 per square foot being paid nearby along Michigan Avenue, in an upscale retail area known as the Magnificent Mile, said people familiar with the matter.\nApple began discussing the new Chicago store more than two years ago with Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who has made development of the Chicago River waterfront a big priority. More than $60 million was spent on the standalone store, which has a 32-foot-tall glass façade and a thin carbon roof.\nThe project included the redevelopment of the surrounding plaza area so that now Michigan Avenue is linked to the riverfront by granite staircases on either side of the store. The plaza, once cut off from the water, now “flows effortlessly down to the river,” Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer, said when the store opened.\nThe store opened in October in a ceremony attended by Mr. Emanuel and Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook.\nApple officials describe the store as the company’s most ambitious partly because of its design and its connection to the river. The store is also bringing in well-known professionals to teach Apple device users about the products, an experience that isn’t available at most other Apple stores around the world.\nWrite to Peter Grant at peter.grant@wsj.com\nCorrections & Amplifications\nApple began discussing the new Chicago store more than two years ago with Mayor Rahm Emanuel. An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Google began discussing the store. (March 20, 2018)",
