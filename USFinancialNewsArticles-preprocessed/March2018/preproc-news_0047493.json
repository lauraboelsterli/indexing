    "text": "March 26 (Reuters) - Husky Energy Inc is facing a number of provincial and federal charges related to a July 2016 pipeline leak that spilled oil into a river in Western Canada, the country’s environmental ministry said on Monday.\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada said it had laid a total of nine charges over the 1,570-barrel leak from Husky’s Saskatchewan Gathering System pipeline, which forced a number of cities in the province of Saskatchewan to temporarily stop drawing drinking water from the North Saskatchewan River.\nThe Western Canadian province laid a tenth charge, saying Husky did “unlawfully permit the discharge of a substance to the environment that caused an adverse effect.”\nThe charges follow a 19-month joint federal-provincial investigation. The maximum fine under Saskatchewan’s environmental rules is C$1 million ($778,938), with the federal laws allowing for fines ranging from C$15,000 to C$1 million.\nHusky is expected to appear in a Saskatchewan court on Thursday. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ($1 = 1.2838 Canadian dollars) (Reporting by Julie Gordon in Vancouver, editing by G Crosse)\n ",
