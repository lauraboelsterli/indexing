    "text": "96.4% of Hercules’ existing Debt Investment Portfolio is priced at floating interest rates, as of December 31, 2017 100.0% of the Company’s outstanding debt liability obligations are fixed rate, as of December 31, 2017 The Prime Rate is expected to increase from 4.50% to 4.75% A 25 basis point increase in the Prime Rate is anticipated to generate approximately $3.2 million, or $0.04 per share of additional Net Investment Income or “NII” (2)\nPALO ALTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hercules Capital, Inc. (NYSE: HTGC) (“Hercules” or the “Company”), the leading specialty finance company to innovative, venture growth, pre-IPO and M&A stage companies backed by leading venture capital firms, today announced the estimated accretive impact to its debt investment portfolio attributed to the Federal Reserve - Federal Open Market Committee’s (“FOMC”) increase in the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, or 0.25%.\nHercules anticipates a 25 basis point increase in the Prime Rate will contribute approximately $3.2 million, or $0.04 per share, of NII per annum, based on the basic weighted share outstanding as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, 96.4% of Hercules’ debt investment portfolio of $1.4 billion, at cost, was primarily priced at PRIME or LIBOR-based floating interest rates, while 100.0% of the Company’s outstanding debt obligations have a fixed rate of interest, well positioning Hercules for additional future rate increases. Given the expected increase to the Prime Rate will be taking effect in late-March 2018, the anticipated increase is not expected to have any material impact to our NII in Q1 2018. The expected benefit from the March 2018 rate increase is expected to materialize beginning with our Q2 2018 operating period.\nBased on Hercules’ Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of December 31, 2017, the following table illustrates the approximate annualized increase in components of net income resulting from hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates, such as prime rate, assuming no changes in the Company’s investments and borrowings.\n(in thousands) Interest Interest Net EPS (2) Basis Point Change Income (1) Expense Income 25 $ 3,152 $ - $ 3,152 $ 0.04 50 $ 6,368 $ - $ 6,368 $ 0.08 75 $ 9,605 $ - $ 9,605 $ 0.11 100 $ 12,937 $ - $ 12,937 $ 0.15 200 $ 26,683 $ - $ 26,683 $ 0.32 300 $ 40,322 $ - $ 40,322 $ 0.48 (1)\nSource: Hercules Capital Form 10-K for Q4 2017\n(2)\nEPS calculated on basic weighted shares outstanding of 82,519. Estimates are subject to change due to impact from active participation in the Company's equity ATM program.\nAbout Hercules Capital, Inc.\nHercules Capital, Inc.
