Persimmon lost 3.6 percent, Evraz retreated 3.4 percent and BHP Billiton was down 2.7 percent.\nThe basic materials sector also suffered on worries over the threat of a global trade war curbing economic growth and metals demand.\nAnglo American and Rio Tinto were down 2.9 percent and 1.2 percent respectively as U.S. trade tensions overshadowed strong February export data from the world’s second largest economy, China.\n“This morning’s Chinese trade data are only likely to reinforce the U.S. administration’s perception of unfair trade,” CMC Markets chief market analyst Michael Hewson said in a note.\nLosses in mining stocks were offset by gains in drugmakers and consumer companies as investors sought refuge in defensive stocks before U.S. President Donald Trump details his tariff plans, expected on Thursday or Friday.\nPizza delivery firm Domino’s Pizza rose 2.6 percent following a better-than-expected 10.2 percent rise in its full year pretax profit.\nAB Foods rose 0.7 percent following an upgrade to “buy” from Goldman Sachs on expectations a weak dollar would underpin its profit recovery.\nSoft drinks company Britvic rose 6.3 pct after Morgan Stanley upgraded it to “overweight”, saying the price offered an attractive entry point.\nAviva had a muted response (up 0.2 percent) from the market after it reported its earnings and said it planned to return 500 million pounds to shareholders. KBW analysts described the results as a “mixed bag”. (Reporting by Danilo Masoni and Julien Ponthus Editing by Andrew Roche)\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
