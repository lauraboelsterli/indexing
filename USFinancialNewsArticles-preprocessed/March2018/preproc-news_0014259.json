Following these changes, the Board size will be reduced to 12 directors.\n“We are very pleased to welcome these two new independent directors to the Board, at a time when NRG is evolving its business to a more customer-focused approach. Their expertise and perspectives will serve NRG well going forward. On behalf of the Board and the entire company, I want to thank Walt, Evan and Barry for their dedicated leadership and unwavering commitment to NRG during their tenure,” said Larry Coben, NRG Board Chairman.\nAbout the new directors:\nMatthew Carter\nMr. Carter served as President and Chief Executive Officer and a director of Inteliquent, Inc., a publicly-traded provider of voice telecommunications services, from June 2015 until February 2017 when Inteliquent, Inc. was acquired.
