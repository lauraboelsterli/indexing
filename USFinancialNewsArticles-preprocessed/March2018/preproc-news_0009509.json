    "text": "ATLANTA, March 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- FieldEdge, the leading field service management software provider, today announced its partnership with LeadsNearby, a full-service digital marketing agency that helps local service contractors acquire and retain customers.\nRe-engagement is important for field service businesses, but many struggle to stay in touch with existing customers in meaningful ways. Thanks to LeadsNearby's integration with FieldEdge, that is no longer an issue. LeadsNearby uses customer data from FieldEdge to enhance and improve a company's digital marketing efforts through marketing automation campaigns, re-engagement promotions, email newsletters and more.\nThe FieldEdge and LeadsNearby integration will help businesses re-engage with past customers and prompt them toward additional conversions. \"Field service businesses understand that customers will seek them out when they need service, but if your business doesn't keep in touch with that audience, those customers may seek advice elsewhere,\" said Bob Misita, Co-founder of LeadsNearby. \"This partnership with FieldEdge enables us to segment messages to past customers based on their purchase behavior, location and potential future needs ensuring that business stays with you.\"\n\"Our goal at FieldEdge is to help contractors grow their business,\" said Rameez Ansari, CEO at FieldEdge. \"This LeadsNearby integration will help those contractors maintain that growth by keeping customers engaged.\"\nThis latest partnership is in addition to FieldEdge's November integration announcement with Nearby Now, which also benefits any client using both LeadsNearby and FieldEdge.
