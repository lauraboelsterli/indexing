    "text": "Source: Taco Bell \nTaco Bell is bringing its menu innovation to the grocery store. \nThe fast food Mexican chain owned by Yum Brands said Thursday it will be rolling out a line of tortilla chips at grocery and convenience stores starting in May. \nCustomers can choose from Classic, Mild and Fire chips, which take their flavor inspiration from Taco Bell's signature sauces. \n\"Our sauce packets are one of the brand's most unique aspects and were the natural choice for both the flavors and packaging of our tortilla chips,\" Marisa Thalberg, chief brand officer at Taco Bell, said in a statement. \nThe Classic tortilla chips are simply salted while the other two varieties are packed with a bit more flavor. The Mild chips are seasoned with three different chili peppers and cumin and the Fire chips have hints of jalapeno, chili peppers and paprika. \nPrices of the bags of chips will be set be each grocery or retail outlet, the company said. \nThese packaged chips, produced by Sugar Foods, will join the line of dips, sauces, shells and seasoning mixes that Taco Bell sells in partnership with Kraft .
