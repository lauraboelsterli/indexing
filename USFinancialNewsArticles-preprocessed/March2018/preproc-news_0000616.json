    "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s exports denominated in yuan rose 36.2 percent in February from a year earlier, the General Administration of Customs said on Thursday.\nFILE PHOTO: A China yuan note is seen in this illustration photo May 31, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration/File Photo Yuan-denominated imports fell 0.2 percent last month, which produced a trade surplus of 224.9 billion yuan.\nCustoms is expected to release dollar-denominated trade data later on Thursday.\nOver the Jan-Feb period combined, exports rose 18 percent year-on-year and imports were up 15.2 percent.\nChina’s trade performance rebounded in 2017 and logged a strong start to this year thanks to robust demand at home and abroad. But escalating trade disputes with the United States are clouding the outlook for exports in 2018, while a cooling property market may curb domestic demand for imported raw materials such as iron ore.\nReporting by Beijing Monitoring Desk; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ",
