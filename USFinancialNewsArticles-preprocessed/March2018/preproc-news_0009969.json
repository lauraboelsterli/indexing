    "text": "Dario Saric hit two key hoops in the final 5:09 to squash Cleveland rallies Thursday night, helping the Philadelphia 76ers hold on for a 108-97 victory over the Cavaliers in a nationally televised game in Cleveland.\nThe win was Philadelphia’s first in three tries against Cleveland this season, and allowed the 76ers (33-27) to move within 2 1/2 games of the Cavaliers (36-25) in the Eastern Conference playoff race.\nThe loss cut into the Cavaliers’ lead in the Central Division. They now lead Indiana (34-27) by just two games.\nThe 76ers led 82-71 after an interior hoop by newcomer Ersan Ilyasova with 9:07 to play before LeBron James had two hoops and teammates Kyle Korver and Rodney Hood each buried a 3-pointer in a 14-3 burst that produced an 85-all tie.\nBut Saric rescued the 76ers for the first time, dropping in a layup that pushed Philadelphia back on top.\nA 3-pointer by Korver with 2:25 to go got the Cavaliers back within one, before Saric again came through at a critical time, burying a 3-pointer of his own to push the 76ers’ advantage back to four at 98-94 with 2:09 to go.\nThe 76ers held on from there to produce their first win after losses to Washington and Miami to open a three-game trip.\nJ.J. Redick had 22 points to lead the 76ers, who never trailed in the second half.\nJoel Embiid (17 points, game-high 14 rebounds) and Robert Covington (10 points, 10 rebounds) recorded double-doubles for the 76ers, while Ben Simmons flirted with a triple-double with 18 points, nine rebounds and a team-high eight assists.\nSaric finished with 16 points.\nJames poured in a game-high 30 points for the Cavaliers, who have alternated wins and losses in their last six games.\nJames also found time for nine rebounds and a team-high eight assists.\nLarry Nance Jr. had 13 points, Hood 11 and Jordan Clarkson 10 for the Cavaliers, who lost for the second time in three outings on their five-game homestand.\nTristan Thompson collected a team-high 11 rebounds for Cleveland.\nThe 76ers held the upper hand through most of the first half, building an eight-point lead in the first quarter and a 10-point lead in the second en route to a 59-56 halftime advantage.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
