FILE PHOTO - Mongolian-born sumo grand champion Hakuho poses for a photo as he celebrates after he established all-time sumo record with his 1,048th win, at the 13rd day of the 15-day Nagoya Grand Sumo Tournament at the Aichi Prefectural Gymnasium in Nagoya, central Japan, in this photo taken by Kyodo July 21, 2017. Mandatory credit Kyodo/via REUTERS Hakuho, the all-time record holder for tournament victories, will need three weeks to fully recover from a ligament injury in his left big toe, according to stable master Miyagino. The 32-year-old withdrew from the New Year Grand Sumo Tournament in January after the first few days with injuries to both big toes. Sumo tournaments last 15 days, with each wrestler appearing for one bout a day. Hakuho is the second grand champion to withdraw from the event, which begins on Sunday at Edion Arena Osaka, with Kisenosato earlier this week deciding to quit the event because of an ongoing chest injury.
