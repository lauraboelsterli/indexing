    "text": "March 1st, 2018 South America \nA former executive of scandal-plagued Brazilian builder Odebrecht [ODBES.UL] told prosecutors investigating the company in Peru that he gave money to President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski’s 2011 election campaign, an attorney for opposition party leader Keiko Fujimori said on local television on Wednesday. \nThe prosecutors traveled to Brazil this week to question the executive, Jorge Barata, about 2011 campaign contributions that they suspect were part of money laundering and graft schemes. \nBarata was once the head of Odebrecht’s operations in Peru and is now cooperating with prosecutors about bribes that the company acknowledged paying to secure contracts. \n  reuters.com",
