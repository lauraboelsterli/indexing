    "text": "March 29, 2018 / 3:48 PM / in 15 minutes MOVES-Merrill Lynch hires former FINRA top cop Susan Axelrod Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nNEW YORK, March 29 (Reuters) - Bank of America Merrill Lynch said Thursday that it hired Susan Axelrod, a former top official at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, to be the wealth management firm’s chief supervisory officer starting in May. \nAxelrod takes over from Michelle Carter. In March, Carter joined Bank of America’s U.S. Trust division, where she leads business planning, governance and controls. \nAxelrod will report to Merrill Lynch Wealth Management Head Andy Sieg. She left FINRA in January after 28 years with the securities industry’s self-regulator. \nAxelrod’s last job with the organization was as executive vice president for regulatory operations.
