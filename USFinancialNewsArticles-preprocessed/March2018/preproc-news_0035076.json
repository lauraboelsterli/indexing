    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Opes Acquisition Corp. (Nasdaq: OPESU) (the “Company”) announced today that it has completed the sale of an additional 1,500,000 units pursuant to the 45-day over-allotment option granted to the underwriters in its initial public offering. Each unit consists of one share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), and one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”) entitling the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The units have been listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”) and trade under the ticker symbol “OPESU.” Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the Common Stock and Warrants are expected to be traded on Nasdaq under the symbols “OPES” and “OPESW,” respectively.\nThe units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating additional gross proceeds of $15,000,000. Including the net proceeds from the exercise of the over-allotment option, together with the proceeds of the private placements conducted simultaneously with the initial closing of the initial public offering and the closing of the over-allotment option, a total of $116,150,000 (or $10.10 per unit sold in the initial public offering including the over-allotment option) has been placed in trust for the benefit of public stockholders.\nOpes Acquisition Corp. is a newly formed blank check company organized for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization, or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. The Company’s efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to any particular industry or geographic region, although the Company initially intends to focus on target businesses located in Mexico.\nEarlyBirdCapital, Inc. acted as sole book-running manager of the offering. The offering was made only by means of a prospectus, copies of which may be obtained from EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., 366 Madison Avenue, 8th Floor, New York, NY 10017, Attn: Investor Relations, 212-661-0200.
