    "text": "MILAN, March 27 (Reuters) - Sky’s Italian unit is close to signing a deal with Italian broadband company Open Fiber that will allow it to stream programs and offer high-speed broadband services, two sources said on Tuesday.\nThe agreement, which will begin in 2019, could be signed as early as this week or next, one of the sources said, adding however the deal had not yet received the final green light.\nThe accord will give Sky Italia access to the ultrafast broadband network Open Fiber is laying in more than 270 Italian towns and cities, the source said.\nThe move comes as more traditional broadcasters review business models to face increased competition from online content providers like Netflix.\nOpen Fiber, jointly controlled by Italy’s state-controlled utility Enel and state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti, is rolling out a fiber-to-the-home network to take on phone incumbent Telecom Italia.
