The Citigroup Inc (Citi) logo is seen at the SIBOS banking and financial conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada October 19, 2017. Picture taken October 19, 2017. REUTERS/Chris Helgren Metzger, who takes up his new role on June 1, replaces Mark Slaughter who will become vice-chairman for the global CIB business and will move back to the United States to be closer to his family, said the memo sent to Citi staff.

Based in Hong Kong, Metzger joined Citi in 2015 as head of Asia Pacific technology, media and telecoms (TMT) banking from Credit Suisse ( CSGN.S ). He was promoted to the role of co-head for global investment banking technology franchise last year. Reporting by Sumeet Chatterjee; Editing by Shri Navaratnam",
