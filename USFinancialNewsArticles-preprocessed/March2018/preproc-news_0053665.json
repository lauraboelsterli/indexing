    "text": "WUHAN, China, March 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- China Automotive Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CAAS) (\"CAAS\" or the \"Company\"), a leading power steering components and systems supplier in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and the audited results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nNet sales were $143.7 million compared to $149.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 Net loss attributable to parent company's common shareholders was $39.0 million, or diluted loss per share of $1.23, reflecting an accrued one-time corporate tax of $35.6 million recognized in the fourth quarter mandated by the recent U.S. tax reform and additional $4.0 million withholding tax for the planned dividends from the Company's PRC subsidiaries in order to fund the payments of such tax.\nFiscal Year 2017 Highlights\nNet sales were $499.1 million, compared to $462.1 million in 2016 Diluted loss per share attributable to parent company's common shareholders was $0.61 compared to diluted income per share attributable to parent company's common shareholders of $0.70 in 2016 Cash and cash equivalents, pledged cash and short-term investments were $125.7 million as of December 31, 2017 Net cash flow from operating activities was $50.2 million\nMr. Qizhou Wu, chief executive officer of CAAS, commented, \"Our growth in 2017 was led by higher sales of our new advanced hydraulic products into the North American market and higher sales of hydraulic products for the commercial vehicle market in China. Our sales to North America grew by 51.4% and accounted for 16.9% of total sales in 2017. Truck sales in China grew by 16.9% in China, led by record sales of 1.1 million units of heavy-duty trucks. With our large and broad line of steering products, we are well positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities in a number of automotive segments.\"\nMr. Jie Li, chief financial officer of CAAS, commented, \"We remain focused on increasing our financial strength. We generated $50.2 million in cash flow from operations in 2017.\"\nFourth Quarter of 2017\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, net sales were $143.7 million compared to $149.6 million in the same quarter of 2016. The net sales decrease was mainly due to the exceptionally strong Chinese auto market in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the production for new products targeting the Company's North American customers reaching its full capacity.\nGross profit was $16.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $21.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to the decrease in net sales and change of product mix.\nGain on other sales was $1.7 million, compared to $1.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nSelling expenses were $6.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher transportation expenses and increased marketing expenses that were related to increased revenue. Selling expenses represented 4.7% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGeneral and administrative expenses (\"G&A expenses\") increased to $5.5 million from $4.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. G&A expenses represented 3.8% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 3.2% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in G&A expenses and G&A expenses as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 was mainly due to higher personnel costs.\nResearch and development expenses (\"R&D expenses\") were $9.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $8.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. R&D expenses represented 6.9% of net sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 5.9% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in R&D expenses was due to ongoing higher investment in EPS product research and development such as brushless motors and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) related projects. Additional engineers, newly acquired technologies, and more testing equipment accounted for most of the increase.\nLoss from operations was $4.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to income from operations of $5.0 million in the same quarter of 2016. The loss was mainly due to lower gross profit and higher investment in R&D and selling expenses.\nInterest expense was $0.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to interest expense of $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to higher average loans outstanding.\nNet financial income was $0.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was consistent with the same quarter of 2016.\nNet loss attributable to parent company's common shareholders was $39.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to the one-time accrued tax of $35.7 million mandated by the recent U.S. tax reform and accrued withholding tax of $4.0 million related to the planned dividend distribution from PRC subsidiaries in order to fulfil the payment of a one-time accrued tax. In the fourth quarter of 2016 net income attributable to parent company's common shareholders was $5.8 million. Diluted loss per share was $1.23 in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to diluted income per share of $0.18 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding was 31,646,897 in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 31,711,888 in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFiscal Year 2017\nAnnual net sales were $499.1 million in 2017, an 8.0% increase compared to $462.1 million in 2016. The overall increase was mainly due to higher sales of advanced legacy hydraulic products offset by the sales of electric power steering systems (EPS) sales which decreased by 6.6% in 2017. EPS sales represented 24.2% of total revenue in 2017.\nGross profit in 2017 was $84.6 million, compared to $80.9 million in 2016. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increase in net sales.\nGain on other sales mainly consisted of the net amount retained from the sales of materials, property, plant and equipment and scraps. For the year ended December 31, 2017, gain on other sales amounted to $7.6 million, compared to $3.8 million in 2016. The increase in gain on other sales was primarily due to the disposal of a building and higher scrap volume in 2017.\nSelling expenses were $19.9 million in 2017, compared to $17.2 million in 2016, which was mainly due to higher transportation and marketing expenses during the year. Selling expenses represented 4.0% in 2017, compared to 3.7% of net sales in 2016.\nG&A expenses were $19.5 million in 2017, compared to $16.8 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs and allowance for doubtful accounts. G&A expenses represented 3.9% of net sales in 2017 compared to 3.6% of net sales in 2016.\nR&D expenses were $33.5 million in 2017, compared to $27.7 million in 2016. R&D expenses represented 6.7% of net sales in 2017, compared to 6.0% of net sales in 2016. The increase in R&D expenses was due to ongoing higher investment in EPS product research and development such as brushless motors and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)-related projects. Additional engineers, newly acquired technologies, and more testing equipment represented most of the increase.\nOperating income was $19.3 million in 2017, compared to $23.0 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to higher operating expenses in 2017.\nInterest expense was $1.8 million in 2017, compared to interest expense of $0.7 million in 2016 due primarily to an increase in loans outstanding and higher interest rates.\nNet financial income was $2.2 million in 2017, compared to net financial income of $1.4 million in 2016 due primarily to an increase in interest income.\nIncome before income tax expenses and equity in earnings of affiliated companies was $20.4 million for 2017, compared to $24.9 million for 2016. This decline was mainly due to lower income from operations and higher interest expense.\nIncome tax expense was $41.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $39.1 million. The increase in 2017 resulted primarily from a one-time accrued tax of $35.6 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 that represented management's estimate of the amount of U.S. corporate income tax for the mandatory repatriation of the Company's share of previously deferred earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries of the Company as mandated by the recent U.S. tax reform. We elected to pay the one-time accrued tax over eight years commencing in April 2018. In addition, withholding tax of $4.0 million was accrued in the fourth quarter of 2017 in order to fund the payment of such one-time accrued tax since the Company plans to distribute dividends from its PRC subsidiaries to the Company. Excluding the one-time accrued tax and withholding tax discussed above, income tax expense was $1.9 million, representing a decrease of $0.6 million which was mainly due to the decrease in income before income tax. The effective tax rate (excluding the impact of the one-time transition tax) was consistent from 2016 to 2017 at approximately 10%.\nNet loss attributable to parent company's common shareholders was $19.3 million in 2017, compared to net income attributable to parent company's common shareholders of $22.5 million in 2016. Diluted loss per share was $0.61 in 2017, compared to diluted income per share of $0.70 in 2016.\nThe weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding was 31,646,897 in 2017, compared to 31,957,052 in 2016.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of December 31, 2017, total cash and cash equivalents, pledged cash and short-term investments were $125.7 million, total accounts receivable including notes receivable were $294.1 million, accounts payable were $240.2 million and bank and government loans were $73. million. Total parent company stockholders' equity was $299.4 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $305.9 million as of December 31, 2016. Net cash flow from operating activities was $50.2 million in 2017.\nBusiness Outlook\nManagement has provided revenue guidance for the full year 2018 of $510 million. This target is based on the Company's current views on operating and market conditions, which are subject to change.\nAbout China Automotive Systems, Inc.\nBased in Hubei Province, the People's Republic of China, China Automotive Systems, Inc. is a leading supplier of power steering components and systems to the Chinese automotive industry, operating through eight Sino-foreign joint ventures.
