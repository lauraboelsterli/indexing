    "text": "The bridge that collapsed at a university in Miami, killing several people, was installed in a single morning and hailed for its innovative construction techniques.\nThe $14.2 million pedestrian walkway that collapsed on Thursday, killing several people near Florida International University, was originally praised for its quick and innovative installation method, according to the Miami Herald. \nThe 950-ton \"instant bridge\" was assembled nearby and then lifted and lowered into place by special cranes. The process, which only lasted a few hours, was praised by Florida International University for significantly reducing risks to workers, pedestrians and motorists, and minimizing traffic disruptions.\nThe bridge had not been fully completed at the time of its collapse.\nMunilla Construction Management collaborated on the project, along with FIGG Bridge Design, the Miami Herald reported. A Twitter account associated with MCM posted on Twitter condolences for those injured and killed in the accident.\n@WeareMCM tweet \nThe company also promised to cooperate with investigators and determine the cause of the accident.\nA Cuban-American family business, MCM did work in Havana, Cuba, before the revolution and won a Pentagon contract in 2016 to help build facilities in Guantánamo Bay, the Miami Herald reported.\nAccording to the Miami New Times, MCM has had legal trouble before, including one incident in which a TSA employee at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport was injured after a temporary bridge collapsed.\nJuan Perez, director of the Miami Dade Police Department, said the homicide bureau will begin an investigation into the incident, immediately following efforts to rescue potential victims.\nStudents and faculty at FIU had long clamored for the pedestrian walkway. It was built to keep students safe from the notoriously busy Tamiami Trail that separates the university from the suburban town of Sweetwater, where an estimated 4,000 students live, the Miami Herald reported.\nTraffic along the Tamiami Trail had become such a problem that in February, campus police launched a pedestrian safety initiative, which included issuing fines for disobeying traffic signals and jaywalking, among other things, FIU News reported. \nDuring the bridge construction on Saturday, a crowd had gathered to watch cranes lower the structure into place, FIU News reported. \nBiology student Roshawn Brown told FIU News he was grateful the walkway would provide fellow students a safer crossing to class every day.\n\"Having this bridge is a blessing,\" he told FIU news. \"It was amazing to watch something like this, because I've always seen highways and bridges being built, and I've never understood how this is made possible.\"\nMCM and Figg Bridge Design did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.",
