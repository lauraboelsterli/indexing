    "text": "Language industry veteran joins regulated industry leader to accelerate emergence as a major global LSP\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Morningside Translations, one of the largest language service providers in North America, announced today that Dennis Dracup – a well-known language industry veteran – has joined the company as Chairman of the Board. Dracup has more than 30 years of operating and board experience in technology-enabled services and most recently served as Chairman and CEO of Language Line Services.\nThis press release features multimedia.

Under his leadership, Language Line increased its revenue tenfold from $40 million to $400 million – a feat he attributes to “hard work and focusing on the right industries and clients, with the best product out there to win those clients.”\nDracup says his top priority as Morningside’s new Chairman is to support management’s growth strategy. “I am excited to leverage my background and skills to help accomplish that,” says Dracup. “Morningside has grown leaps and bounds in the past five years and now truly has the potential to emerge alongside some of the largest global players.”\nDracup was approached by multiple LSPs and other businesses over the last few years after departing Language Line. “We know that Dennis had a lot of choices in the past eighteen months or so and we’re very proud that he chose to join forces with us. He has already become deeply engaged in our business,” said Tom Klein, Co-CEO and board member.\nDracup says he decided to return to the language services industry because language services are near and dear to his heart. “This industry has gone from being fairly rudimentary, and frankly misunderstood, to a real requirement for businesses and organizations in servicing their customers and growing strategically,” he said. “I think I have a great deal of relevant knowledge to leverage.”\nAs for the factors that led him to choose Morningside, he explained, “I really like the management team here. Tom and Roland and the senior leadership have the skills and motivation to take this company to great heights. And it’s a lot of fun to watch them bring new thinking to language services and professionalize this industry as operators.”\nDracup is no stranger to regulated industry language service requirements. Approximately ½ of Language Line’s revenue was from the medical and life sciences sector. Dracup sees in Morningside’s client base and verticals the same sorts of stringent quality and accuracy and expertise requirements.\n“There is just a ton of technical knowledge required to support intellectual property, legal, and health care customers and those clients have a lot of exposure so we have to make sure we get it right every time. In these regulated areas, translation and localization fold into a broader suite of value added services that our clients really count on us for.”\nAbout Morningside Translations:\nMorningside Translations is the fastest growing major language service provider in North America and one of the largest intellectual property translation companies in the world.
