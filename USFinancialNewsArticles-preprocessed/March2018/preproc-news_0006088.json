During the first quarter of 2017, we revised our definition of EBITDA to exclude the adjustment of interest expense relating to our non-recourse debt as a reconciling item to arrive at net income (loss) in order to conform to the presentation of the timeshare industry following the consummation of the spin-off from Hilton. The revised definition was applied to prior period(s) to conform with current presentation. Adjusted EBITDA, presented herein, is calculated as EBITDA, as previously defined, further adjusted to exclude certain items, including, but not limited to, gains, losses and expenses in connection with: (i) asset dispositions; (ii) foreign currency transactions; (iii) debt restructurings/retirements; (iv) non-cash impairment losses; (v) reorganization costs, including severance and relocation costs; (vi) share-based and certain other compensation expenses; (vii) costs related to the spin-off; and (viii) other items.\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss) or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our definitions of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nWe believe that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions; and (ii) EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in our industry. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), cash flow or other methods of analyzing our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our interest expense (excluding interest expense on non-recourse debt), or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness; EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the effect on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations; EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for future replacements of assets that are being depreciated and amortized; EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA may be calculated differently from other companies in our industry limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.\nReal Estate Metrics\nContract sales represents the total amount of VOI products under purchase agreements signed during the period where HGV has received a down payment of at least 10 percent of the contract price. Contract sales is not a recognized term under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to Sales of VOIs, net or any other comparable operating measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Contract sales differ from revenues from the Sales of VOIs, net that HGV reports in its consolidated statements of operations due to the requirements for revenue recognition as described in Note 2: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements, as well as adjustments for incentives and other administrative fee revenues. HGV considers contract sales to be an important operating measure because it reflects the pace of sales in HGV’s business.\nDeveloped Inventory refers to VOI inventory source from projects the Company develops.\nFee-for-Service Inventory refers to VOI inventory HGV sells and manages on behalf of fourth-party developers.\nJust-in-Time Inventory refers to VOI inventory primarily sourced in transactions that are designed to closely correlate the timing of the acquisition with HGV’s sale of that inventory to purchasers.\nNOG or Net Owner Growth represents the year-over-year change in membership.\nReal estate margin represents sales revenue less the cost of VOI sales and sales and marketing costs, net of marketing revenue. Real estate margin percentage is calculated by dividing real estate margin by sales revenue. HGV considers this to be an important operating measure because it measures the efficiency of the Company’s sales and marketing spending and management of inventory costs.\nSales revenue represents sale of VOIs, net and commissions and brand fees earned from the sale of fee-for-service intervals.\nTour flow represents the number of sales presentations given at HGV’s sales centers during the period.\nVolume per guest (“VPG”) represents the sales attributable to tours at HGV’s sales locations and is calculated by dividing Contract sales, excluding telesales, by tour flow. The Company considers VPG to be an important operating measure because it measures the effectiveness of HGV’s sales process, combining the average transaction price with closing rate.\nFree cash flow represents cash from operating activities adjusted for share based compensation, less non-inventory capital spending.\nAdjusted free cash flow represents free cash flow less net proceeds from securitization activities.\nResort and Club Management and Rental Metrics\nTransient rate represents the total rental room revenue for transient guests divided by total number of transient room nights sold in a given period and excludes room rentals associated with marketing programs, owner usage and the redemption of Club Bonus Points.\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REAL ESTATE MARGIN (in millions) 2017 First Second Third Fourth Full Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Year Sales of VOIs, net $ 118 $ 143 $ 145 $ 142 $ 548 Sales, marketing, brand and other fees 130 144 127 143 544 Less: Marketing revenue and other fees 32 43 34 36 145 Sales revenue 216 244 238 249 947 Less: Cost of VOI sales 33 34 40 41 148 Sales and marketing expense, net (1) 112 120 132 128 492 Real estate margin $ 71 $ 90 $ 66 $ 80 $ 307 Real estate margin percentage 32.9 % 36.9 % 27.7 % 32.1 % 32.4 % 2016 First Second Third Fourth Full Quarter Quarter Quarter Quarter Year Sales of VOIs, net $ 115 $ 114 $ 130 $ 149 $ 508 Sales, marketing, brand and other fees 118 128 136 117 499 Less: Marketing revenue and other fees 27 28 32 35 122 Sales revenue 206 214 234 231 885 Less: Cost of VOI sales 38 28 44 42 152 Sales and marketing expense, net (1) 100 112 117 118 447 Real estate margin $ 68 $ 74 $ 73 $ 71 $ 286 Real estate margin percentage 33.0 % 34.6 % 31.2 % 30.7 % 32.3 % (1) Includes revenue recognized through our marketing programs for existing owners and prospective first-time buyers.
