    "text": "17 COMMENTS COX’S BAZAR, Bangladesh—The United Nations plans to build more than 50 watchtowers around Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh to protect them from wild elephants, which have killed at least 10 people since nearly 700,000 Rohingya started arriving from Myanmar seven months ago.\nThe camps sprawl across traditional migratory and feeding routes for the animals, which regularly enter the clusters of huts and wreak havoc. U.N. officials in Bangladesh estimate that 500,000 people are somewhere in their path.\nThe issue is serious enough that it is commanding resources from aid groups. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which helps oversee the displaced Rohingya, said Tuesday that 17 elephant response teams have been formed in the camps and were already warding off elephant attacks, including chasing away two pachyderms during recent intrusions. \n“The next few weeks we’re going to see more incidents,” said Caroline Gluck, a UNHCR representative in Bangladesh. “It is the dry season so they look for food and water. That is why we’re speeding up on all of this. This is a really critical period.”\nThe response teams, comprised of Rohingya who are paid a stipend, will begin as early as next week to construct 56 watchtowers, which the UNHCR said would manned 24 hours a day.\nThe U.N. says elephants have killed 10 Rohingya since August and injured many others. \nHossain Ahammed had an elephant crash into his shack, lift him up and toss him headfirst into a tree. He was knocked unconscious and received emergency treatment for a head injury. Friends say that he now sometimes falls into rages and speaks incoherently.\n“I came here for safety,” said Mr. Ahammed. “But it is turned out to be the opposite.”\nThe Rohingya, a long-persecuted Muslim minority in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, began fleeing to Bangladesh in August after Myanmar’s military launched a campaign of killings, rape and burning villages in response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents. The U.S. has called the operations ethnic cleansing and U.N. officials have said they bear the hallmarks of genocide.\nMyanmar denies the allegations but has refused to give human-rights investigators access to the area.\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature, an environmental group working with the U.N. on the issue, says the camps are highly exposed to elephants, with numerous entry points. The group helped establish the response teams to chase off the elephants using flashlights and whistles.\nA deforested section of the Chakmakul camp for Rohingya refugees clings to a hillside in southern Bangladesh, February 13, 2018.
