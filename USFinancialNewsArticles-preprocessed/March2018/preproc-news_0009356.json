Price, Chairman of the Board, effective following the Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 15, 2018. Consistent with its succession plan, the Board of Directors also announced that Vice Chairman, Mark Saleh has been confirmed as Chairman Elect to succeed Mr. Price after the 2018 Annual Meeting.\nSteve Miller, CEO & President stated that, “David Price was the original founder of the Bank and has been instrumental in developing the culture of the bank. This culture is rooted in the idea that by giving staff a “stake in the outcome” through our ESOP, the performance of the bank, the level of service for customers and the return for shareholders will exceed the market. His leadership, enthusiasm and commitment to our vision and values have been the driving force behind our success. Personally, Dave gave me the opportunity to lead this organization, and for that I will be forever grateful.”\nDavid Price remarked, “These years have been some of the best in my life, and I am proud to see the progress and growth of our fine company. A smooth succession plan is the mark of a strong board. We are encouraged by this process and feel the bank is well positioned for the future. I look forward to stepping back to enjoy the next stage of my life.”\n“I have worked with Dave for many years, and it has been a privilege. I wish him every happiness in his well-deserved retirement,” commented, Chairman Elect, Mark Salah. “I am honored to be the incoming Chairman, and look forward to building on his legacy and continuing to work with Steve, my fellow board members and our excellent management team to grow our franchise.”\nAbout Fresno First Bank and Communities First Financial Corporation.
