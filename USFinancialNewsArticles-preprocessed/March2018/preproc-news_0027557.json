    "text": "0 COMMENTS Health-care payer consolidation continues at a rapid pace. Look for drug manufacturers to chime in with some larger deals of their own.\nTwo prescription drug supply deals worth more than $50 billion have been announced since December. Last week, insurer Cigna said it plans to buy pharmacy-benefit manager Express Scripts Holding, just three months after CVS Health announced it plans to buy Aetna . If these deals close successfully, nearly every large publicly traded health insurer will have their own PBM in house. Other large buyers of high-price drugs, such as hospitals, continue to tie up as well.\nThat dynamic threatens to pressure the bottom line of manufacturers. Drug companies set a given medicine’s gross, or list, price. But when a manufacturer makes a sale, the net price of the medicine is what the company books as revenue. The difference comprises rebates and discounts paid to other parties like insurers, which pay for the medicine, and pharmacy-benefit managers, which enable the transaction.\nWhile manufacturers regularly raise the list prices of drugs they sell, evidence has emerged that the manufacturers are receiving a smaller share of those increases than in the past.\nJohnson & Johnson said last week that the average list price across its U.S. drug portfolio rose 8.1% in 2017. After rebates and discounts, however, the average price fell by 4.6%, a differential of nearly 13 percentage points. A year ago, that differential was just 5 percentage points.\nConsolidation among the industry’s larger players would be a natural, if imperfect, response. Larger mergers can help regain some negotiating heft as well as provide more opportunities to cut costs and protect future growth.\nGranted, drug companies have done their fair share of deals as well in recent years, but there is still room for more. There are more than 20 drug manufacturers with projected 2018 sales of more than $10 billion and balance sheets throughout the sector are generally strong enough to support more deal making.\nThat means drug companies have the opportunity to respond as well as increasing urgency to do so.\nWrite to Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.com",
