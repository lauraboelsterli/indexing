    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - The British authorities know more about a substance which Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal was exposed to before he became critically ill, interior minister Amber Rudd said on Wednesday, adding that police would make a further statement later.\nSkripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are both in hospital in a critical condition after being found unconscious on Sunday on a bench near a shopping centre in the southern English city of Salisbury.\n“We do know more about the substance and the police will be making a further statement this afternoon in order to share some of that,” Rudd told reporters after chairing a meeting of top ministers to discuss the Skripal incident.\nReporting by Estelle Shirbon; editing by Michael Holden\n ",
