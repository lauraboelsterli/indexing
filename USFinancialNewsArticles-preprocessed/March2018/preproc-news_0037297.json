    "text": "Previous Next Trump not moving to fire Mueller but is frustrated: White House Reuters 25 mins ago Â© REUTERS/Joshua Roberts Special Counsel Mueller departs after briefing members of the U.S. Senate on his investigation in Washington President Donald Trump is not moving to fire U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller but is frustrated by the length of the ongoing probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, the White House said on Monday.\nSpokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters on the Air Force One flight carrying Trump to New Hampshire that Trump's weekend tweets criticizing Mueller by name do not presage a firing.\n\"The president is not moving to get rid of Robert Mueller,\" he said. He said the tweets reflected \"some well-established frustration\" felt by Trump over the Russian investigation.\n(Reporting By Roberta Rampton; Editing by Tom Brown)\n",
