In the meantime, all sanctions and maximum pressure must remain.\"\nA meeting between Kim and Trump, who have exchanged bellicose insults in the past year that have  \n\"I told him (Trump) that in our meeting that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said that he's committed to denuclearization,\" Chung said. \"Kim pledged that North Korea will refrain from any further nuclear or missile tests.\"\n\"He expressed his eagerness to meet President Trump as soon as possible,\" he said. \"President Trump appreciated the briefing and said he would meet Kim Jong Un by May to achieve denuclearization.\"\n  President Bill Clinton, President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama.\nUnder Clinton in October 2000, then-U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright held talks in Pyongyang with then-North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, the father of Kim Jong Un.\nOn Thursday night Trump took to Twitter with a series of posts putting the potential meeting with Kim in a positive frame.\n\"Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze,\" said one post. And Trump added: \"Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. Meeting being planned!\"\nJOINT MILITARY EXERCISES\nChung and National Intelligence Service chief Suh Hoon flew to Washington earlier on Thursday to explain North Korea's stance on possible future talks with Washington and the prospect of Pyongyang suspending nuclear tests if the security of the North's government is assured.\nIn what would be a key North Korean concession, Chung said Kim \"understands that the routine joint military exercises between the Republic of Korea and the United States must continue.\" Pyongyang had previously demanded that such joint drills be suspended in order for any U.S. talks to go forward.\nTrump in the past has derided the North Korean leader as a maniac, referred to him as little rocket man and threatened in a speech to the United Nations last year to \"totally destroy\" his country of 26 million people if it attacked the United States or one of its allies.\nKim had responded by calling the U.S. president a mentally deranged U.S. dotard.\nTrump has also been scathing in his criticism of Kim and of previous U.S. administrations for not doing more to rein in the North Korean government.\nJapanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said on Friday North Korea must commit to abandoning nuclear development completely in order for meaningful talks to take place with Pyongyang. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the change in North Korea's attitude is the result of pressure from allies Japan, the United States and South Korea and others.\n  noted there had still been no public comment from North Korea about the content of Mondays meeting.\n\"Lets hear from the North Koreans themselves what they are proposing and what they are willing to do. There is plenty of reason to be cautious, given their track record. Second, lets read the fine print. The North has made peace overtures in the past that did not hold up under scrutiny,\" Russell said.\nTensions over North Korea rose to their highest in years in 2017,   programs   to hold their first summit since 2007 in late April.\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in has said sanctions should not be eased for the sake of talks and that nothing less than denuclearization   Jeff Mason, David Brunnstrom and Matt Spetalnick in WASHINGTON and Christine Kim in SEOUL, additional reporting by Steve Holland in WASHINGTON, Ben Blanchard in BEIJING and Aaron Maasho and Kumerra Gemechu in ADDIS ABABA; Editing by Will Dunham, James Dalgleish, Grant McCool)",
