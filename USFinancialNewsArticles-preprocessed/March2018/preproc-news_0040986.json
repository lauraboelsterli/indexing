(TSX:SMT)(BVL:SMT) (\"Sierra Metals\" or the \"Company\") today reported revenue of $205.1 million and adjusted EBITDA of $81.0 million on throughput of 1,988,738 tonnes and metal production of 14.9 million silver equivalent ounces, 90.4 million copper equivalent pounds, and 193.2 million zinc equivalent pounds for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring 2017, silver equivalent production increased by 26%, copper equivalent production decreased 1%, and zinc equivalent production decreased by 9% compared to 2016. During Q4 2017, silver equivalent production increased by 15%, copper equivalent production decreased 12%, and zinc equivalent production decreased by 8% compared to Q4 2016. The decrease in metal production was due to lower production in Mexico, partially offset by record throughput, which led to an increase in production, in Peru. The temporary decrease in metal production in Q4 2017 compared to Q4 2016 was primarily due to lower throughput, head grades, and recoveries at the Bolivar Mine, and decreases in throughput and recoveries at the Cusi Mine.\nSimilar to the successful program at Yauricocha in Peru, which began in 2015, the Company has engaged in an operation turnaround program in Mexico to modernize operations, improve production, and lower costs. The Company has already realized a 2% increase in throughput at Bolivar and a 23% increase at Cusi in Q4 2017 compared to Q3 2017, and further throughput increases are expected to continue during the first half of 2018. Equivalent metal production variances are partially the result of differences in realized metal prices used in the equivalent metal calculations for both periods.\nMexican operations have seen quarterly improvements over the last two quarters. At Bolivar, there have been increases in tonnage as a result of new equipment purchases, which have allowed more minable stopes to be incorporated into the mine plan. At Cusi, the Company has changed its focus from mining the existing narrow vein structures to the recently discovered Santa Rosa de Lima zone, which has significantly larger widths and higher grades. Cusi reported a significant improvement in metal recoveries, and the 2018 guidance is based on projections which reflect the potential for record silver production and lower costs, as a result of the restructuring program performed during the second half of 2017, which focused on the mining of the Santa Rosa de Lima structure. Both mines have also benefitted from successful improvement efforts in metallurgical recoveries, which have increased during Q4 2017 compared to previous quarters.\nIgor Gonzales, President and CEO of Sierra Metals stated: \"The Company remains focused on improving operating performance through the production of higher value ore, strengthening its asset base, and continuing to increase its mineral reserves and resources at each of its mines.\"\n\"At Yauricocha the company had record throughput leading to increases in production in 2017. The Mine continues to deliver and is poised for further improved productivity in 2018 with completion of the Yauricocha tunnel expected to be up and running at the beginning of Q3 2018. The new tunnel will provide a direct run to the mill from the mine, which will result in a faster turn-around in the cycle time of the trolley locomotives. In the long run this means more capacity to handle larger volumes of waste and ore. Also, in 2018 the Yauricocha shaft will be sunk to the 1270 level, with a loading pocket added below the 1170 working level. The Company will also commence the addition of three loading points with independent discharge points for haulage on the 1170 level with expected completion in 2020. Last but certainly not least, exploration continued to play a very important for the Company in 2017 and the Yauricocha Mine saw a significant increase in its reserves and resources with the mine life more than doubling.\"\nHe continued \"At Bolivar the Company saw a temporary decrease in metal production primarily due to lower throughput, head grades, and recoveries. Improvements were made through the implementation of new equipment purchases, metallurgical recoveries were improved at the mill, and the hiring of additional staff and technical expertise helped to improve production in Q4 2017 over Q3 2017 with continued improvements being seen in Q1 2018. Also, an additional, refurbished ball mill was recently purchased which will provide flexibility pertaining to grind size and tonnage at the Bolivar operations. Production is expected to reach 3,000 tonnes per day in Q1 2018 and grow to 3,500 tonnes per day in the second half of 2018. Exploration also continued in 2017 and an update on reserves and resources for the Bolivar mine in Mexico in expected in the coming month.\"\n\"At Cusi, the Company remained focused on completing ramp access, development, and production from the Santa Rosa de Lima zone which contains structures that are more than two times the width, and nearly twice the silver head grades than what has been previously mined closer to surface. This resulted in lower than planned production, however, similar to Bolivar we have seen improved throughput in Q4 2017 over Q3 2017 as the Company continues to ramp up production at the Mal Paso mill expecting to reach mill capacity of 650 tonnes per day in Q2 2018. The Company also saw remarkable improvements to the metallurgical recoveries at the mill. Future production growth is important to Sierra Metals and the Company has recently purchased a refurbished ball mill to be installed which will allow production to be ramped up to 1,200 tonnes per day by January 2019. Exploration continues to play an important role in the growth strategy at Cusi and the Company saw a significant increase in resources at Cusi from a successful exploration program completed in 2017.\"\nHe Concluded: \"Sierra Metals continues to have a very strong balance sheet, thanks in part to a stronger metal price environment which provides us with the liquidity needed for continued operational successes, growth opportunities and development that has been planned for this year. Brownfield exploration programs remain a growth component at all three of our mines in 2018 and we are very optimistic that these programs will continue to add high value tonnage going forward. When combined with our continued production optimization program, it should result in substantial growth, not only in production with lower costs, but most importantly in shareholder value.\"\nThe following table displays selected financial and operational information for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017:\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\n(In thousands of dollars, except per share and cash cost amounts,\nconsolidated figures unless noted otherwise)\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nOperating\nOre Processed / Tonnes Milled\n509,488\n517,705\n1,988,738\n2,034,465\nSilver Ounces Produced (000's)\n496\n789\n2,317\n2,979\nCopper Pounds Produced (000's)\n7,471\n6,153\n26,775\n23,390\nLead Pounds Produced (000's)\n5,736\n9,990\n29,704\n40,551\nZinc Pounds Produced (000's)\n19,545\n17,039\n76,088\n56,610\nGold Ounces Produced\n1,591\n1,867\n6,197\n8,604\nCopper Equivalent Pounds Produced (000's) 1\n21,856\n24,969\n90,354\n91,398\nZinc Equivalent Pounds Produced (000's) 1\n47,287\n51,229\n193,152\n211,583\nSilver Equivalent Ounces Produced (000's) 1\n4,078\n3,533\n14,865\n11,798\nCash Cost per Tonne Processed\n$\n50.57\n$\n40.05\n$\n46.87\n$\n40.47\nCost of sales per AgEqOz\n$\n7.91\n$\n7.17\n$\n7.75\n$\n8.72\nCash Cost per AgEqOz 2\n$\n7.54\n$\n6.84\n$\n7.41\n$\n8.58\nAISC per AgEqOz 2\n$\n12.42\n$\n12.92\n$\n12.34\n$\n15.11\nCost of sales per CuEqLb 2\n$\n1.48\n$\n1.01\n$\n1.27\n$\n1.02\nCash Cost per CuEqLb 2\n$\n1.41\n$\n0.97\n$\n1.22\n$\n1.00\nAISC per CuEqLb 2\n$\n2.32\n$\n1.83\n$\n2.03\n$\n1.77\nCost of sales per ZnEqLb 2\n$\n0.68\n$\n0.49\n$\n0.60\n$\n0.45\nCash Cost per ZnEqLb 2\n$\n0.65\n$\n0.47\n$\n0.57\n$\n0.44\nAISC per ZnEqLb 2\n$\n1.07\n$\n0.89\n$\n0.95\n$\n0.80\nCash Cost per ZnEqLb (Yauricocha) 2\n$\n0.57\n$\n0.43\n$\n0.50\n$\n0.42\nAISC per ZnEqLb (Yauricocha) 2\n$\n0.90\n$\n0.74\n$\n0.78\n$\n0.71\nCash Cost per CuEqLb (Bolivar) 2\n$\n1.72\n$\n1.00\n$\n1.49\n$\n1.12\nAISC per CuEqLb (Bolivar) 2\n$\n3.03\n$\n2.59\n$\n2.68\n$\n2.21\nCash Cost per AgEqOz (Cusi) 2\n$\n18.67\n$\n12.88\n$\n15.38\n$\n9.37\nAISC per AgEqOz (Cusi) 2\n$\n36.33\n$\n24.42\n$\n33.90\n$\n18.60\nFinancial\nRevenues\n$\n51,170\n$\n41,825\n$\n205,118\n$\n143,180\nAdjusted EBITDA 2\n$\n19,208\n$\n15,985\n$\n81,034\n$\n41,887\nOperating cash flows before movements in working capital\n$\n17,812\n$\n16,197\n$\n79,785\n$\n44,303\nAdjusted net income attributable to shareholders 2\n$\n3,241\n$\n3,516\n$\n23,482\n$\n7,006\nNet income (loss) attributable to shareholders\n$\n2,118\n$\n(5,076)\n$\n(4,645)\n$\n(12,265)\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n23,878\n$\n42,145\n$\n23,878\n$\n42,145\nWorking capital\n$\n(6,784)\n$\n9,576\n$\n(6,784)\n$\n9,576\n(1) Silver equivalent ounces and copper and zinc equivalent pounds for Q4 2017 were calculated using the following realized prices: $16.77/oz Ag, $3.13/lb Cu, $1.11/lb Pb, $1.45/lb Zn, $1,282/oz Au.

Higher revenues are primarily attributable to the 14% increase in throughput, the increase in copper, and zinc head grades, and higher recoveries for all metals, except gold, at Yauricocha; and the increase in the prices of copper (26%), lead (26%), and zinc (35%) in 2017 compared to 2016; this was partially offset by a 7% decrease in throughput and lower head grades and recoveries for all metals, except gold recoveries, at Bolivar; and a 53% decrease in throughput and lower head grades for all metals, except gold, and lower recoveries of all metals, except zinc, at Cusi.\nYauricocha's cash cost per zinc equivalent payable pound was $0.50 (2016 - $0.42), and all-in sustaining cash cost (\"AISC\") per zinc equivalent payable pound was $0.78 (2016 - $0.71) for 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in the AISC per zinc equivalent payable pound for 2017 compared to 2016 were the result of increased sustaining capital expenditures, which included a substantial amount of infill drilling, ventilation improvements, equipment purchases, and plant improvements. The increase was also a result of temporary increases to the mining costs, partially due to timing; as well as slight increases related to infill drilling and drift development costs that will be utilized within one year, and thus are included in operating costs. This was partially offset by lower treatment and refining costs incurred during 2017 compared to 2016, resulting from improved terms on re-negotiated sales contracts with our off-takers, which helped offset higher sustaining capital expenditures.\nBolivar's cash cost per copper equivalent payable pound was $1.49 (2016 - $1.12), and AISC per copper equivalent payable pound was $2.68 (2016 - $2.21) for 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in the AISC per copper equivalent payable pound during 2017 was due to a decrease in copper equivalent payable pounds as a result of 7% lower throughput, as well as an increase in sustaining capital expenditures related to the various equipment purchases made by the Company during the year in an effort to improve equipment availability and increase tonnage. With the expected increase in tonnage at Bolivar in 2018, the Company expects the all-in sustaining cost per copper equivalent pound sold to be approximately $1.96 versus $2.68 in 2017.\nCusi's cash cost per silver equivalent payable ounce was $15.38 (2016 - $9.37), and AISC per silver equivalent payable ounce was $33.90 (2016 - $18.60) for 2017 compared to 2016. AISC per silver equivalent payable ounce increased due to the 53% decline in throughput which resulted in fewer silver equivalent payable ounces as the Company continued its refocused efforts on completing access, development and production from the Santa Rosa de Lima zone which contains wider structures and higher silver grades. With the expected increase in tonnage at Cusi in 2018, the Company expects the all-in sustaining cost per silver equivalent ounce sold to be approximately $14.28 versus $33.90 in 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA (1) of $81.0 million for 2017 increased compared to $41.9 million in 2016. The increase in adjusted EBITDA in 2017 was primarily due to the $56.9 million increase in revenues at Yauricocha, discussed previously.\nCash flow generated from operations before movements in working capital of $79.8 million for 2017 increased compared to $44.3 million in 2016. The increase in operating cash flow is mainly the result of higher revenues generated and higher gross margins realized.\nCash and cash equivalents of $23.9 million and working capital of $(6.8) million as at December 31, 2017 compared to $42.1 million and $9.6 million, respectively, at the end of 2016. Cash and cash equivalents have decreased by $18.3 million during 2017 due to $54.5 million of operating cash flows being offset by capital expenditures incurred in Mexico and Peru of $(51.6) million, repayment of loans, credit facilities and interest of $(47.5) million, dividends paid to non-controlling interest shareholders of $(3.4) million, and proceeds from issuances of loans and credit facilities of $29.8 million. Included in the $54.5 million of operating cash flows were negative changes in non-cash working capital items of $7.9 million due to the increase accounts receivable and decrease in deferred revenue as at December 31, 2017.\n(1)\nThis is a non-IFRS performance measure, see Non-IFRS Performance Measures section of the MD&A.\nProject Development\nThe Company provided an updated Mineral Reserve Estimate at the Company's Yauricocha Mine (press release dated October 26, 2017). Previously the Company had also provided an updated Mineral Resource Estimate at the Company's Yauricocha Mine (press release dated September 28, 2017).
