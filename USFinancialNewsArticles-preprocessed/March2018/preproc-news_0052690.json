    "text": "IRVING, Texas, March 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CEC Entertainment, Inc. (the \"Company\") today announced financial results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter Results (1)\nCompany venue sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased $7.2 million from the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily driven by a 6.0% decline in comparable venue sales. Deferred amusement revenue was $3.4 million less than the fourth quarter of 2016, resulting in cash revenue from our Company-operated venues decreasing $10.6 million from the 2016 fourth quarter. Total revenues were $196.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $204.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Company reported net income of $52.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a net loss of $10.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter net income was positively impacted by a $66.6 million adjustment to our deferred income tax liability related to the recently enacted tax law changes. Before the impact of this adjustment, our fourth quarter net loss was $13.7 million, compared to a net loss of $10.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by the decline in revenue and an increase in marketing costs, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses and lower depreciation.\n\"There were several factors which impacted our business in 2017, which our team is addressing diligently,\" said Tom Leverton, Chief Executive Officer. \"We have put several measures in place to address these challenges, including launching new advertising campaigns addressing moms and kids, as well as a revitalized approach to birthdays. Additionally, we have identified several improvements to our website and digital marketing platform. While our primary focus has been on revenue, we recently implemented several changes in our corporate support structure to better align with our recent performance. We are optimistic that these combined revenue and cost initiatives should have a positive impact on our revenues and operating results in future periods.\"\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, Adjusted EBITDA decreased $11.4 million to $25.5 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were $67.2 million, and the principal outstanding on our debt was $986.5 million, with net availability of $140.1 million on our undrawn revolving credit facility. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we had capital expenditures of $19.6 million, of which $8.1 million related to growth initiatives, $1.9 million related to IT initiatives, and $9.6 million related to maintenance capital expenditures, primarily consisting of game enhancements and general venue capital expenditures.\n(1)\nFor our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, see the financial table \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" included within this press release.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company's system-wide portfolio consisted of:\nChuck E.
