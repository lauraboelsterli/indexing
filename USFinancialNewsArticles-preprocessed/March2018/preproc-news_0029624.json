Ethanol is enjoying a large price gap compared with gasoline, leading owners of flex fuel cars to opt for the biofuel at pumps.\nCopersucar projects 2018/19 center-south sugar output at 31 million tonnes, 5 million tonnes less than in the previous season. It sees ethanol production at 27.5 billion liters, 1.5 billion liters more than last year.\nThe sugar cooperative, which controls U.S.-based ethanol trader Eco-Energy, expects a smaller crop in Brazil’s center-south, at 585 million tonnes, saying insufficient cane field renovation have led to old plantations that produce less. Its crop number means a reduction of 10 million tonnes of cane.\nEthanol sales are expected to help Brazilian mills amid a depressed global sugar market. A large sugar supply, with production increases in countries such as India, Thailand and the European Union, has held prices low. Some analysts in Brazil estimate ethanol to give returns around 25 percent higher than sugar sales.
