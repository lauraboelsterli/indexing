Maintaining high levels of member and provider satisfaction and engagement will be top priorities.\nVolin brings almost 24 years of managed care operations and leadership experience to HPP. He has a proven track record in a wide array of specialties, including strategy and infrastructure development, care model implementation, marketplace assessment and the development of departmental performance metrics and business process improvement initiatives.
