    "text": "March 20, 2018 / 11:42 PM / Updated 12 minutes ago Brazil's PSDB selects Alckmin as 2018 presidential candidate Reuters Staff 2 Min Read SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The centrist Brazilian Social Democratic Party (PSDB) officially selected Sao Paulo state governor Geraldo Alckmin as its candidate for Brazil’s 2018 presidential election on Tuesday, formalising a move that had been expected since he was chosen as the party’s leader in December. FILE PHOTO: Sao Paulo's Governor Geraldo Alckmin gestures after he was elected leader of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) during their convention in Brasilia, Brazil December 9, 2017. REUTERS/Adriano Machado/File Photo Alckmin was governor of Brazil’s richest and most populous state from 2001 to 2006 and again from 2011 to now. He ran for president in 2006, but lost to working-class hero Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is still Brazil’s most popular politician despite a corruption conviction that could bar him from running or even land him in jail. Alckmin, whose support is hovering in the single digits in the polls, has made it clear he would back measures to shore up Brazil’s fiscal deficit, and has backed an overhaul to Brazil’s costly pension system. He has also said he would support privatising state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, as it is commonly known. Brazil’s presidential election, which coincides with congressional and gubernatorial elections, is scheduled for October. Reporting by Gram Slattery; Editing by Lisa Shumaker",
