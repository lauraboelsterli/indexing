(\"Uniti\" or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:UNIT) today announced its results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017.\n“We deployed over $1 billion of capital during 2017 with the acquisitions of Hunt, Southern Light, and NMS and investments in our organic growth initiatives. We expanded our customer relationships, successfully executed on our integration strategies, converted to an UpREIT structure, and favorably repriced our term loans. We continue to expect a multi-year investment cycle for communication infrastructure. Deployments of infrastructure for 5G technologies, the FirstNet network in the U.S., and continuing expansion of the Red Compartida wholesale network in Mexico provide tremendous opportunities for our businesses,” commented Kenny Gunderman, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nMr. Gunderman continued, “The announcement today of our TPx sale-leaseback transactions demonstrate the momentum we are gaining at Uniti Leasing, and the attractive economics of this vertical. We expect Uniti Leasing will be an important contributor to our future growth as shared communication infrastructure is increasingly accepted within our industry. With Uniti Leasing, Uniti Fiber and Uniti Towers, we now have three established businesses with attractive organic growth to supplement our acquisition strategy and further diversify our asset and customer base.”\nQUARTERLY RESULTS\nRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $246.3 million. Net income and Adjusted EBITDA was $22.8 million and $198.0 million, respectively, for the same period. Net income attributable to common shares was $20.5 million for the period, and included a $28.2 million income tax benefit related to the impact of tax reform under the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 , and the release of tax related valuation allowances. Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”) attributable to common shares was $112.4 million, or $0.64 per diluted common share.\nUniti Fiber contributed $66.6 million of revenues and $31.5 million of Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017. Uniti Fiber’s net success based capital expenditures during the quarter were $­­39.0 million. Maintenance capital expenditures were $1.0 million.\nFULL YEAR 2017 RESULTS\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $916.0 million. Net loss and Adjusted EBITDA was $8.8 million and $749.5 million, respectively, for the same period. Net loss attributable to common shares was $16.6 million for the period, and included $38.0 million of transaction and integration costs, a $10.7 million charge for changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, partially offset by a $36.2 million income tax benefit related to the impact of tax reform and the release of tax related valuation allowances. AFFO attributable to common shares was $424.8 million, or $2.51 per diluted common share.\nUniti Fiber contributed $202.8 million of revenues and $84.0 million of Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017, and includes in the results of Hunt and Southern Light from their July 3, 2017 closing date. Uniti Fiber’s net success based capital expenditures during the year were $­­127.0 million. Maintenance capital expenditures were $4.4 million.\nTPX SALE-LEASEBACK AND FIBER ACQUISITION\nThe Company has entered into agreements to acquire fiber assets from U.S. TelePacific Holding Corp. (“TPx”) for all-cash consideration of $95 million. In the transactions, Uniti will acquire and leaseback to TPx, on a triple-net basis, 38,000 fiber strand miles located across California, Nevada, Texas, and Massachusetts. In addition, Uniti will acquire and have exclusive use of 7,000 fiber strand miles located in Texas, which are adjacent to Uniti Fiber’s southern network footprint. Uniti will also have non-exclusive rights to market, on behalf of TPx, certain of the fiber assets in California and Massachusetts.\nThe transactions are subject to customary closing conditions and are expected to close in two tranches, with the non-California assets expected to close in the second quarter and the remaining California assets to close in the third quarter of this year. The initial lease term will be 15 years with five 5-year renewal options at TPx’s discretion. Upon closing of both transactions, annual cash rent will initially be $8.8 million with a fixed annual escalator of 1.5%. The Company expects to fund the transactions through borrowings on its revolving credit facility.\nLIQUIDITY AND FINANCING TRANSACTIONS\nAt quarter-end, the Company had approximately $59.8 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, and $470 million of undrawn borrowing availability under its revolving credit agreement. The Company’s leverage ratio at quarter end was 5.8x based on Net Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDA.\nAs previously reported, on February 7, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.60 per common share, payable on April 13, 2018 to stockholders of record on March 30, 2018.\nFULL YEAR 2018 OUTLOOK\nOur current outlook excludes any future acquisitions, capital market transactions, transaction costs, and the impact of the TPx transaction. Furthermore, our outlook is subject to adjustment based on the finalization of purchase price allocations related to acquisitions and other factors. Actual results could differ materially from these .\nThe Company’s consolidated outlook for 2018 is as follows (in millions):\nFull Year 2018\nRevenue $ 999.0 to $ 1,010.0 Adjusted EBITDA (1) 796.0 to 805.0 Interest expense (2) 320.0 to 320.0 Attributable to common shareholders: Net income 10.1 to 19.1 FFO (1) 373.5 to 382.5 AFFO (1) 444.0 to 453.0 Weighted-average common shares outstanding - diluted 176.2 to 176.2 (1) See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.
