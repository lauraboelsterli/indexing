    "text": "RICHMOND, Va. and CAYCE, S.C., March 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Georgia Public Service Commission has unanimously approved the merger of Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE: D), and SCANA Corporation (NYSE: SCG). In doing so, the Georgia PSC became the first state regulatory agency to act on the proposed combination.\n\"We greatly appreciate the prompt action by Chairman McDonald and the other commissioners in moving forward with our proposal,\" said Thomas F. Farrell, II, Dominion Energy chairman, president and chief executive officer. \"This is an important step in bringing a brighter energy future to customers, communities and others served by the SCANA companies. We look forward to receiving the additional required regulatory approvals and completing our transaction by the end of this year.\"\nThe Federal Trade Commission previously granted early termination of the 30-day waiting period under the federal Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. The merger is also contingent upon approval of SCANA's shareholders; review and approval from the public service commissions of South Carolina and North Carolina; and authorization of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\nUnder a merger agreement announced in January, the combined company would deliver energy to approximately 6.5 million regulated customer accounts and have an electric generating portfolio of about 31,400 megawatts and 93,600 miles of electric transmission and distribution lines. It also would have a natural gas pipeline network totaling 106,400 miles and operate one of the nation's largest natural gas storage systems with 1 trillion cubic feet of capacity.\nAbout Dominion Energy\nDominion Energy is one of the nation's largest producers and transporters of energy, with a portfolio of approximately 26,000 megawatts of electric generation, 14,800 miles of natural gas transmission, gathering and storage pipeline, and 6,600 miles of electric transmission lines. Dominion Energy operates one of the nation's largest natural gas storage systems with approximately 1 trillion cubic feet of storage capacity and serves nearly 6 million utility and retail energy customers. For more information about Dominion Energy, visit the company's website at www.dominionenergy.com .\nAbout SCANA\nSCANA Corporation, headquartered in Cayce, S.C., is an energy-based holding company principally engaged, through subsidiaries, in electric and natural gas utility operations and other energy-related businesses. Information about SCANA and its businesses is available on the company's website at www.scana.com .\nForward-looking statements\nThis release contains statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The statements relate to, among other things, expectations, estimates and projections. We have used the words \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"could,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"plan,\" \"outlook,\" \"predict,\" \"project,\" \"should,\" \"strategy,\" \"target,\" \"will,\" \"would,\" \"potential\" and similar terms and phrases to identify forward-looking statements in this release. Factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to: the expected timing and likelihood of completion of the proposed acquisition of SCANA, including the ability to obtain the requisite approval of SCANA's shareholders; the risk that Dominion Energy or SCANA may be unable to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for the transaction or required regulatory approvals may delay the transaction or cause the parties to abandon the transaction; the risk that conditions to the closing of the transaction may not be satisfied; or the risk that an unsolicited offer for the assets or capital stock of SCANA may interfere with the transaction. Other risk factors for Dominion Energy's and SCANA's businesses are detailed from time to time in Dominion Energy's and SCANA's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q or most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nImportant additional information\nIn connection with the proposed transaction between Dominion Energy, Inc. and SCANA Corporation, Dominion Energy has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a combined preliminary proxy statement of SCANA and preliminary prospectus of Dominion Energy, as well as other relevant documents concerning the proposed transaction.
