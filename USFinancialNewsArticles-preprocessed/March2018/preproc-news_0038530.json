Earphones are seen on a tablet screen with a Spotify logo on it, in Zenica, Bosnia and Herzegovina, February 20, 2014. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/File Photo In an amended filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company expects shareholders to sell up to 55.7 million ordinary shares. ( bit.ly/2u77nhu ) Spotifyâ€™s direct listing will let investors and employees sell shares without the company raising new capital or hiring a Wall Street bank or broker to underwrite the offering.
