    "text": "SAN MATEO, Calif., March 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Franklin Resources, Inc. (NYSE:BEN), which operates as Franklin Templeton Investments, today announced the acquisition of Random Forest Capital, LLC (“Random Forest”), an investment firm with expertise in data science and non-bank marketplace lending. Following the acquisition, the Random Forest team will join the Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group investment team. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.\nJenny Johnson, president and COO of Franklin Templeton Investments, said, “We continue to make strategic investments and acquisitions in emerging investment-related technologies to augment and support Franklin Templeton’s global offerings. The Random Forest team will complement our existing fundamental fixed income research with their expertise in private lending and bring the capability to support the firm’s broader information technology and data science initiatives.”\nRandom Forest approaches investment management from the perspective of data science, in which machine learning and statistical algorithms are applied to solve for expected gains in financial investments using complex models. They have built a scalable cloud infrastructure that enables them to take massive amounts of unstructured data to not only gain key insights, but also to find new predictive power in the data.\nChris Molumphy, CIO of Franklin Templeton Fixed Income Group, said, “The advanced pace of technological disruption is impacting the traditional investment landscape, providing new ways to identify and originate investment opportunities that generate value for investors.
