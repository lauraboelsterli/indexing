    "text": "SPRINGFIELD, N.J., March 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Village Super Market, Inc. (NASDAQ:VLGEA) today reported its results of operations for the second quarter ended January 27, 2018.\nNet income was $9,511,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $5,992,000 in the second quarter of the prior year. The second quarter of fiscal 2018 includes a $2,726,000 non-cash reduction in deferred tax expense as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). Excluding this item from the second quarter of fiscal 2018, net income increased 13% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to the favorable impact of a reduction in the fiscal 2018 estimated effective tax rate to 33.5% as a result of the Tax Act.\nSales were $417,382,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 1.3% compared to the second quarter of the prior year. Same store sales increased due to sales growth in recently remodeled and expanded stores in Chester and Stirling, inflation and increased promotional spending. These increases were partially offset by two competitor store openings. The Company expects same store sales in fiscal 2018 to range from a 0.5% decrease to a 0.5% increase. New stores and replacement stores are included in same store sales in the quarter after the store has been in operation for four full quarters. Store renovations and expansions are included in same store sales immediately.\nGross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 26.90% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 26.99% in the second quarter of the prior year primarily due to decreased patronage dividends from Wakefern, increased promotional spending and decreased departmental gross margin percentages partially offset by a favorable change in product mix.\nOperating and administrative expense as a percentage of sales increased to 23.02% in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 22.90% in the second quarter of the prior year due primarily to payroll investments in service departments, training and other initiatives.\nNet income was $12,528,000 in the six-month period of fiscal 2018 compared to $10,101,000 in the six-month period of the prior year. Fiscal 2018 includes a $2,726,000 non-cash reduction in deferred tax expense as a result of the Tax Act. Excluding this item, net income decreased 3% in the six-month period of fiscal 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher operating and administrative expenses partially offset by the favorable impact of a reduction in the fiscal 2018 estimated effective tax rate to 33.5% as a result of the Tax Act.\nVillage Super Market operates a chain of 29 supermarkets under the ShopRite name in New Jersey, Maryland and northeastern Pennsylvania.\nForward Looking Statements\nAll statements, other than statements of historical fact, included in this Press Release are or may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities law.
