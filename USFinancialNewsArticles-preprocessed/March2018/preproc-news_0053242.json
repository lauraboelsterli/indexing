    "text": "LOS ANGELES, March 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE-- Brookmount Explorations, Inc . (“Brookmount”), a Nevada incorporated company (OTC:BMXI) announced that The Company has reported solid progress in its gold production operations in Indonesia with production for the 6 (six) months to December 31, 2017 exceeding 1,600 oz, generating revenue for the period of approximately $2 million. Operating profit for the period was in excess of $800,000. In commenting on the result, the Board of BMXI noted significant improvements in production yields from the Company’s heap leaching extraction process at its operating facility in Northern Sulawesi province, due primarily to recent changes in key processing components including chemical mix, carbon filtration and pumping speeds.\nIn addition to continually working to improve its extraction yields, both from its heap leaching and floatation processing operations, The Company is actively looking to expand its operations through upgrading its processing facilities and acquiring additional high yielding gold properties in the region.\nThe Board also indicated that The Company is in the process of completing a US GAAP audit of its operations in Indonesia with the intention of acquiring a fully reporting status and upgrading its listing to the QB Exchange of the OTC Market.\nSafe Harbor Statements:\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, certain of the matters discussed in this communication constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
