    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on Thursday pressed Russia and Iran to use their influence over Syriaâ€™s President Bashar al-Assad to ensure Damascus respects a U.N. resolution calling for a 30-day ceasfire.\nLe Drian also reiterated that France will respond if it is proven chemical weapons have been used and killed people.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron and his government have in recent weeks repeatedly called for a truce in Syria to allow the delivery of humanitarian aid to trapped civilians, but the fighting continues.\nReporting by Richard Lough; Editing by Brian Love\n ",
