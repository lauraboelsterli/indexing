If you are the executives of some of the biggest banks, you tell investors that branches will be the fuel to drive the next phase of growth. Having a weakened rival that you can steal customers from helps.\nJPMorgan Chase JPM 1.88% and Bank of America BAC 1.85% have announced plans recently to open branches in new markets. Investors shouldn’t dismiss these moves.\nThey won’t say it, but the bank executives all know that Wells Fargo , WFC 0.44% one of their biggest rivals, is immersed in scandal and has done a good job angering customers and regulators. And they know that to bring in customers in new markets they need branches.\n\nJPMorgan said in January it would open up to 400 new branches over the next five years, expanding into 15 to 20 new markets. The bank has branches in 23 states, but not yet in major markets like Washington, D.C., Boston and Philadelphia, its statement said. Wells Fargo has the most branches of any bank in Washington and the second most in the Philadelphia area, according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.\nNot about to be outdone, Bank of America said last week it plans to open more than 500 new branches over the next four years. It highlighted plans to move into the major Ohio metropolitan areas of Cincinnati, Cleveland and Columbus. Wells Fargo doesn’t have a significant presence in the state, but Bank of America hasn’t said where else it will open branches.\nThe banks are still shutting branches in existing markets, so their total branch counts will likely keep declining. The plans for expansion into new cities highlights the crucial role that brick-and-mortar branches still play in the industry. In a recent survey, research firm Novantas found that just under half of U.S. customers visit a bank branch at least once a month.\nBranches are especially important for attracting new customers. Americans may perform many routine tasks online, but 60% still prefer to open a checking account in a bank branch, according to Novantas.\nIn a note, analysts at Morgan Stanley looked at recent expansions by Bank of America into Denver and Minneapolis, and by JPMorgan into Jacksonville, all in the past few years. The new entrants gained significant share in all three cases, but somewhat surprisingly, local banks weren’t the hardest hit. Rather, in each case it was Wells Fargo that lost the most market share, from around 1.5% share in Jacksonville to more than 5% in Minneapolis.\nBanks are entering a new period of growth, bolstered by healthy capital levels, less burdensome regulation and higher interest rates. Branch openings will remain a key competitive tactic for banks. As for Wells Fargo, with the Federal Reserve capping its growth and new sales controversies still emerging, it looks like a sitting duck to rivals.\nWrite to Aaron Back at aaron.back@wsj.com",
