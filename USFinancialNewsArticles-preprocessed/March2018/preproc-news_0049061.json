    "text": "HOUSTON, March 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GulfMark Offshore, Inc. (“GulfMark” or the “Company”) (NYSE:GLF) today announced its results of operations for the three month period ended December 31, 2017. Recent highlights include:\nSuccessfully reorganized, converted $429 million of debt into equity and raised $125 million of new equity Strong balance sheet with sufficient cash and borrowing capacity Number one market position in the U.K. North Sea segment, which is leading the global OSV recovery Highest global utilization since Q4 2015 Highest Americas utilization since Q3 2015 16 percentage point sequential quarterly increase in Southeast Asia utilization 10 percentage point sequential quarterly increase in Americas utilization Lowest G&A run rate in over 10 years; owned vessel count up approximately 40% during same period G&A run rate down to $25 million per year and continuing to decrease No remaining contracted capital obligations New investor-focused board Significant asset appreciation opportunity with appraised fleet value of approximately $600 million and an original construction cost of approximately $1.7 billion\nQuintin Kneen, President and CEO, commented, “We are proud to report that the turnaround of GulfMark has progressed successfully, and we are now in an excellent position to capitalize on the ultimate recovery in the offshore vessel market. Our market leading position in the U.K. sector of the North Sea; our young, technologically advanced vessels; our strong balance sheet and our improving operational performance put us in position to achieve our goal of a cash flow positive run rate by the end of 2018.\n“Our significant exposure to the recovery-leading North Sea market is proving advantageous. Tendering activity for vessels is up substantially in the North Sea. High-end day rates for premium tonnage in the upcoming summer are approaching $17,000 per day. This means average term rates for 2018 should be well above the 2017 full-year average term rate of approximately $8,000 per day. Our marketed utilization in the North Sea remains well over 90%, and we are very optimistic about activity levels continuing their pattern of year-over-year increases in 2018. The North Sea has recovered to the point where we are seeing the typical calendar year seasonality, and our expectation is that we will see the strongest second and third quarters in years.\n“Our post-restructuring balance sheet positions us as one of the lowest net-debt offshore vessel companies in the world. We are confident that our existing liquidity, comfortable covenant requirements and improving cash flow from operations provide strong liquidity to provide GulfMark with one of the best competitive positions in the offshore support vessel industry.”\nKneen continued, “Returning to sustainable, positive cash flow is key to every member of the GulfMark team. As shown in the tables to this press release, we were EBITDA positive for the stub period since emerging from our restructuring through the end of the year, and that was before implementing additional measures to improve cash flow.\n“In 2018, we have already taken actions to lower our cost structure further while better positioning Gulfmark to capitalize on improving market conditions. Our general and administrative expense for 2017 was $35.8 million. We currently estimate our general and administrative expenses will be under $25.5 million in 2018. This reduction in G&A expense is enabled by our world class information systems. It is part of an overall streamlining of our operations which is also making GulfMark more efficient and better positioned both to be patient and to capitalize on improving market conditions.\n“The significant improvement in tendering activity, utilization and days worked in Southeast Asia and the Americas during the fourth quarter tells us these regions are matching the early pattern of the recovery that we have already seen in the North Sea. As such, we anticipate strengthening day rates and utilization in 2018 throughout the Company.”\n“I continue to be amazed at what our employees achieved, while maintaining a positive, can-do attitude throughout the restructuring and industry downturn. Their focus on operational excellence and safety remains steadfast, and my sincere thanks goes out to all of our employees worldwide for their dedication to GulfMark.”\nAs more fully explained in the Company’s Form 10-K that will be filed on April 2, 2018, the Company emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 14, 2017, at which time it adopted fresh start accounting in accordance with applicable accounting and reporting regulations. This resulted in the Company becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes on November 15, 2017.\nConference Call/Webcast Information\nGulfMark will conduct a conference call to discuss earnings with analysts, investors and other interested parties at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, March 29, 2018.

Statements in this press release that contain may include, but are not limited to, information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations and statements about future operating expenses, liquidity, vessels sales, market developments, taxes, reductions in costs and expenses, and funding of capital commitments. These are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect on us. While management believes that these are reasonable as and when made, there can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we anticipate. All comments concerning our expectations for future revenues are based on our forecasts for our existing operations. Our involve significant risks and uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) and assumptions results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or projections. Important factors results to differ materially from those in the include, but are not limited to: the price of oil and gas and its effect on offshore drilling, vessel utilization and day rates; industry volatility; fluctuations in the size of the offshore marine vessel fleet in areas where the Company operates; changes in competitive factors; delays or cost overruns on construction projects, and other material factors that are described from time to time in the Company’s filings with the SEC, including the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.

Net income, excluding gains & costs, as well as measures derived from it (including diluted EPS, excluding gains & costs; and effective tax, excluding gains & costs) are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the exclusion of certain gains & costs from these financial measures enables it to evaluate more effectively GulfMark’s operations period over period, and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked by the excluded items. The foregoing non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following tables include a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures.\nIncome Statements (unaudited) Successor Predecessor Successor Predecessor (in thousands, except per share data) Period from November 15 Through December 31, Period from October 1 Through November 14, Three Months Ended September 30, Three Months Ended December 31, Period from November 15 Through December 31, Period from January 1 Through November 14, Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 2017 2017 2016 2017 2017 2016 Revenue $ 13,593 $ 13,424 $ 25,805 $ 26,616 $ 13,593 $ 88,229 $ 123,719 Direct operating expenses 9,859 10,830 20,431 18,181 9,859 69,821 83,165 Drydock expense -
