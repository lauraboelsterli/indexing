    "text": "Kellyanne Conway, a top adviser to President Donald Trump, violated the federal law prohibiting some political activity by high-level officials, in two television interviews she gave, and has been recommended for disciplinary action, the U.S. Office of Special Counsel said Tuesday.\nA report by that office on Conway's alleged Hatch Act violations said that in both cases, \"Conway appeared in her official capacity\" and in one case \"advocated against one Senate candidate and gave an implied endorsement of another candidate.\"\n\"In the second interview, she advocated for the defeat of one Senate candidate and the election of another candidate,\" the counsel's office said.\n\"Both instances constituted prohibited political activity under the Hatch Act and occurred after Conway received significant training on Hatch Act prohibitions,\" according to the report.\nThe office, which has submitted the report to Trump \"for appropriate disciplinary action,\" said it gave Conway the opportunity to respond to the allegations, but she did not respond.\nThe office said that on November 20, Conway appeared in her official capacity on Fox News's Fox & Friends \"and discussed why voters should not support Democrat Doug Jones in the Alabama special election for U.S. Senate.\"\n\"On December 6, 2017, Conway appeared in her official capacity on CNN's New Day and discussed why voters should support Republican Roy Moore and not Democrat Doug Jones in the Alabama special election for U.S. Senate,\" the office said.\n\"While the Hatch Act allows federal employees to express their views about candidates and political issues as private citizens, it restricts employees from using their official government positions for partisan political purposes, including by trying to influence partisan elections,\" the report says.\n\"In passing this law, Congress intended to promote public confidence in the Executive branch by ensuring the federal government is working for all Americans without regard to their political views.\"\nThis is a breaking news story.
