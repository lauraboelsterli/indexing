The 37-year-old, a four-times Six Nations winner, has been appointed as assistant forwards coach at Harlequins and will work alongside forwards coach Graham Rowntree. Jones’ 18-year senior club career started with Welsh club Neath and included spells with the Ospreys and a season with Cardiff Blues before joining Harlequins in 2015. “I’ve had a great career and never thought I’d go on to achieve what I have,” he said in a statement. “I’m so passionately proud to have played so many times for Wales and was fortunate to be a part of three Grand Slam-winning teams.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru",
