    "text": "BERWYN, Pa., March 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- RM LAW, P.C. announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of all persons or entities that purchased Aflac Incorporated (\"Aflac\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: AFL) securities between February 27, 2013 and January 11, 2018, inclusive (the \"Class Period\").\nAflac shareholders may, no later than April 16, 2018, move the Court for appointment as a lead plaintiff of the Class. If you purchased shares of Aflac and would like to learn more about these claims or if you wish to discuss these matters and have any questions concerning this announcement or your rights, contact Richard A. Maniskas, Esquire toll-free at (844) 291-9299 or to sign up online, click here .\nThe complaint filed in this class action alleges that during the Class Period defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Aflac hired its sales associates under false promises of high compensation packages and work-life balance; (2) Aflac misclassified its employees as independent contractors to reduce costs associated with unemployment insurance taxes and employment benefits; (3) Aflac manipulated its average weekly producer equivalent metric to fabricate growth; (4) consequently, Aflac violated its Code of Conduct and corporate social responsibility standards; and (5) as a result, Aflac's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\nIf you are a member of the class, you may, no later than April 16, 2018, request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff of the class. A lead plaintiff is a representative party that acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member's claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class. Under certain circumstances, one or more class members may together serve as \"lead plaintiff.\" Your ability to share in any recovery is not, however, affected by the decision whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff. You may retain RM LAW, P.C. or other counsel of your choice, to serve as your counsel in this action.\nFor more information regarding this, please contact RM LAW, P.C. (Richard A. Maniskas, Esquire) toll-free at (844) 291-9299 or by email at rm@maniskas.com or click here .
