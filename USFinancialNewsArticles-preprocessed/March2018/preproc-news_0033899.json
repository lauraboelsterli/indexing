    "text": "BALLERUP, Denmark, LiqTech International, Inc. (NYSE MKT: LIQT), a clean technology company that manufactures and markets highly specialized filtration technologies, announced today its financial and operational results for fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017.\nFinancial highlights for the three months ended December 31, 2017\nNet sales for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $3.0 million compared to $2.6 million for the same period in 2016, representing an increase of $0.4 million or 15%.\nThe increase in net sales was primarily driven by an increase in sales of membranes and systems of $0.4 million. The sales of diesel particulate filters (DPF) of $1.5 million was at the same level as the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nGross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $0.1 million compared to a negative gross profit of $0.8 million for the same period in 2016, representing an improvement of $0.9 million.\nIncluded in gross profit is depreciation of $0.2 million and $0.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nNet loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $1.0 million compared to a loss of $11.4 million for the same period of 2016, representing an improvement of $10.4 million.\nFinancial highlights for the year ended December 31, 2017\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $11.3 million compared to $13.9 million for the same period in 2016, representing a decrease of $2.6 million or 19%.\nThe decrease in sales consists of an increase in sales of DPFs of $1.4 million offset by a decrease in sales of liquid filters of $3.8 million and a decrease in Kiln furniture of $0.2.\nThe increase in demand for our DPFs is mainly due to an increase in market activity in China compared to the same period last year. The decrease in demand for our liquid filters and systems is due to significant larger water filtrations systems sales in 2016 compared to 2017 and the delay in marine scrubber systems sales in 2017 compared to 2016.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.2 million compared to $1.4 million for same period in 2016, representing a decrease of $1.2 million or 86%.\nThe decrease in gross profit was due to lower sales activity in general, lower gross margin and due to lower sales activity for our liquid filters and systems, which historically have a higher gross margin, compared to the same period in 2016.\nIncluded in gross profit is depreciation of $0.9 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $4.5 million compared to a loss of $16.4million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an improvement of $11.9 million.\nCash on hand and restricted cash for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $2.5 million compared to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $1.3 million or 108%.\nWorking capital for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $4.7 million compared to $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 representing an increase of $1.2 million.\nIn discussing the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 results, Mr. Sune Mathiesen, LiqTech CEO, remarked: \"Our results for the fourth quarter were largely in line with our expectations. We were happy to note the anticipated and earlier discussed ramp-up in our marine scrubber business. Following the IMO decision in November 2016 to implement a new lower global cap on sulphur emissions from international shipping, we have continued to invest significant resources in developing the marine scrubber market. We have been working in this emerging industry for almost 4 years now and we have made continuous improvements to our technology. Today we offer a very competitive solution for scrubber manufactures and ship owners. Our systems are of modular design and we offer significant advantages in terms of foot-print, quality of discharge, short delivery times, Capex and Opex.\nWe are encouraged by the development in our marine scrubber business, and we believe that our long-term commitment has positioned us well to be one of the market leaders for water treatment systems to this industry. Even though still in early stages, we have noted an increasing interest from ship owners to install scrubbers. Analysts following the industry expect that the pace of adoption of scrubbers will continue to increase. Based on the feed-back from our customers we share this belief, and we are ready to ramp-up our business to match the increased demand. We are happy with the progress we made so far and we believe that we will make further progress in the first half of 2018.\nIn 2017 we dedicated most of our resources to the marine scrubber industry. We believe that this has proven the right choice. In 2018 we will continue these efforts. In addition to this we will dedicate more resources into the power plant industry. We have been successful in establishing ourselves in this industry in Denmark and we are planning to broaden this out to other geographical areas. Our systems for power plants are very similar to the systems we have developed for marine scrubbers and we offer the same advantages. We are of course also continuing our efforts to establish our technology in the swimming pool, oil & gas, mining, drinking water and aquaculture markets. The long-term goal is to see the same adoption of our technology as we now see in the marine scrubber market.\nWe are also continuing our efforts to establish our DPF technology in the Chinese market. We have worked with Chinese and American manufactures of exhaust systems to approve our product to the new higher emission standards that are being implemented in China now, and in February 2018 we announced a new order for China.\nWe believe that our narrowed focus and the development of standardized systems has proven to be the right choice. We are continuing our efforts to turn the Company profitable and we believe that 2018 will prove to be a turning point in our business.\"\nConference Call Details\nInterested parties may participate in the call by dialing (877) 407-8029 or (201) 689-8029.
