The deal between Luxottica, the world’s biggest eyeglass frame maker, and Essilor, the world No. 1 lens maker, would create a company that would make products for various well-known brands such as Oakley and Ray-Ban. Reuters reported in December that the deal would be cleared. Reporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek",
