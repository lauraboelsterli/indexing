    "text": "35 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court appeared far from consensus on cracking the constitutional conflict of interest presented by politicians drawing their own electoral districts, at an argument in its second gerrymandering case of the term.\nWednesday’s case involved Maryland’s Sixth Congressional District, which justices across the spectrum agreed was drawn specifically to push the seat into the Democratic column.\nThe evidence was “pretty damning,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor told Maryland’s lawyer, Steven Sullivan. “Your own governor [said] that he felt duty-bound to ensure that his party won.”\nAnd it did so, with Democrats picking up a seat to hold seven of Maryland’s eight votes in the U.S. House.\nMr. Sullivan, the state solicitor general, said the district was drawn to be “competitive,” and observed that Maryland voters rejected a Republican-led voter referendum to junk the map.\n“This is not, as many a redistricting case might be presented to you, as a blow for democracy. This would be a blow against democracy,” he said.\nWhile Mr. Sullivan took flak for partisan motives the Democratic former governor, Martin O’Malley, has publicly acknowledged, the challengers’ lawyer, Michael Kimberly, fared no better with his claim that the Maryland map violated Republican voters’ free-expression and political-association rights.\nJustice Samuel Alito said he had difficulty making sense of Mr. Kimberly’s theory. “But, if understand it, I really don’t see how any legislature will ever be able to redistrict,” Justice Alito said. “Hasn’t this court said time and again you can’t take all consideration of partisan advantage out of districting?”\nRelated Video A ​Supreme Court case on gerrymandering — the practice of drawing district boundaries for political advantage — could reshape the country’s political landscape. Critics say the partisan redistricting undermines representative democracy. Video/Photo: Madeline Marshall/WSJ. Mr. Kimberly’s approach was developed in part to address First Amendment concerns that Justice Anthony Kennedy, a pivotal vote on gerrymandering issues, has raised regarding partisan redistricting practices. While Justice Kennedy appeared sympathetic to the theory, he questioned whether it was appropriate to throw out Maryland’s congressional map so close to the 2018 elections.\n“People are planning campaigns and so forth,” he said. “Are you suggesting that it would not be disruptive...for this court to remand to consider whether the map should be changed at this late date?”\n“I think it would perpetuate the same sort of uncertainty, frankly, that’s been hanging over Maryland politics from the pendency of this suit all along,” Mr. Kimberly said.\nThe Supreme Court itself is partly responsible for the argument’s timing. In September, Mr. Kimberly asked the justices to expedite the hearing by scheduling it in November alongside a separate gerrymandering case from Wisconsin. The court declined, instead sticking with plans to hear the Wisconsin case alone in October.\nIn that case, Democratic voters alleged that the Wisconsin Assembly map drawn by Republican lawmakers violated the Constitution’s equal-protection clause by inflating the number of GOP seats far out of proportion to the party’s share of the statewide vote. The political-science measurements the challengers proposed for shaping fair election districts in Wisconsin gained little traction from the court’s right wing, with Chief Justice John Roberts dismissing the research as “sociological gobbledygook.”\nThe court subsequently agreed to hear the Maryland case, perhaps hoping it could provide an approach that commanded five votes. With a likely stalemate evident, Justice Stephen Breyer proposed going back to the drawing board—literally.\nHe raised the idea of holding a new hearing for all three pending gerrymandering cases. A third case involving claims over North Carolina maps is on hold at the court, pending the outcome of the Wisconsin and Maryland cases.\n“You could have a blackboard and have everyone’s theory on it, and then you’d have the pros and cons and then you’d be able to look at them all and then you’d be able to see perhaps different ones for different variations,” Justice Breyer said. “We’d have right in front of us the possibilities, as thought through by lawyers and others who have an interest in this subject.”\n“Sure,” Mr. Kimberly said.\nWhile the gerrymandering question continues to flummox the U.S. Supreme Court, some states have taken action to promote what they consider fairer elections. Earlier this year, for instance, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, invoking the state constitution’s “free and equal” elections provision, set aside a congressional map that Republican legislators drew to favor their party and adopted new lines that may help Democrats win representation closer to their share of the statewide vote. The U.S. Supreme Court declined GOP leaders’ appeals to intervene.\nNewsletter Sign-up A decision in Wednesday’s case, Benisek v. Lamore, is expected before July.\nWrite to Jess Bravin at jess.bravin@wsj.com",
