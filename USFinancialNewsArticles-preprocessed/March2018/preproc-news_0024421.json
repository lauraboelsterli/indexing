In an emailed statement, the presidency said it was working with international organisations and negotiators to ensure the girls, taken by suspected Boko Haram Islamist militants, were released unharmed. They were kidnapped on Feb. 19. Reporting by Felix Onuah; Writing by Alexis Akwagyiram and Paul Carsten; Editing by Catherine Evans",
