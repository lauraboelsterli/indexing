    "text": "Achieved Record Sales of $15 Billion\nSEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN) today reported fourth quarter earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter ended February 3, 2018 of $0.89, which included impacts associated with corporate tax reform consisting of a $0.25 charge primarily related to its income tax provision and a one-time pretax investment in its employees of $16 million or $0.06. Net sales for the fourth quarter increased 8.4 percent, inclusive of approximately $220 million related to the 53rd week, and comparable sales increased 2.6 percent.\nFor fiscal 2017, earnings per diluted share was $2.59, including corporate tax reform-related reductions of $0.31. Earnings were in-line with the Company's prior outlook of $2.90 to $2.95, which did not incorporate the impacts related to corporate tax reform. Net sales increased 4.4 percent and comparable sales increased 0.8 percent, slightly exceeding the Company's prior outlook for sales growth of approximately 4.2 percent and comparable sales increase of approximately 0.5 percent.\nIn fiscal 2017, the Company reached record sales of $15.1 billion, achieving the following milestones in executing its growth plans:\nNordstrom experienced continued positive customer trends, reflecting customer growth of 4 percent to 33 million. Generational investments, which include Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook , Canada and Trunk Club, contributed $1.5 billion in sales. In the Nordstrom full-price business, strategic brands, including product with limited distribution and Nordstrom proprietary labels, continued to deliver outsized sales growth. The Nordstrom Rack off-price business gained 6 million new customers with approximately one-third of off-price customers expected to cross-shop the full-price business over time. Nordstrom Rewards customers increased by 35 percent to 10.5 million. Sales from Nordstrom Rewards customers represented 51 percent of sales, an increase from 44 percent in 2016.\nFOURTH QUARTER SUMMARY\nFourth quarter net earnings were $151 million and earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) was $350 million, or 7.6 percent of net sales, compared with net earnings of $201 million and EBIT of $424 million, or 10.0 percent of net sales for the same period in fiscal 2016. Net earnings included a $42 million charge related to corporate tax reform, including a one-time, non-cash charge of $51 million related to the revaluation of its deferred tax assets, partially offset by cash tax savings from a lower federal tax rate. Retail EBIT decreased $93 million compared with the same quarter last year, reflecting investments in capabilities to support the Company's growth plans. Credit EBIT increased $19 million, primarily due to higher credit card revenues. Total Company net sales of $4.6 billion for the fourth quarter increased 8.4 percent, inclusive of approximately $220 million, or 520 basis points, from the 53rd week, compared with net sales of $4.2 billion during the same period in fiscal 2016. Total Company comparable sales for the fourth quarter increased 2.6 percent. In the Nordstrom brand, which includes U.S. and Canada full-line stores, Nordstrom.com and Trunk Club, net sales increased 6.4 percent and comparable sales increased 2.4 percent. Across U.S. full-line stores and Nordstrom.com , the top-performing merchandise categories were Kids' and Men's Apparel. In the Nordstrom Rack brand, net sales increased 15.0 percent and comparable sales increased 3.7 percent. Retail gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, of 35.6 percent decreased 42 basis points compared with the same period in fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher occupancy expenses related to new store growth for Nordstrom Rack, Canada and the New York City Men's flagship. Merchandise margin performance was in-line with the Company's expectations, reflecting continued strength in regular price selling trends. Ending inventory increased 6.9 percent over last year, generally in-line with the Company's expectations. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, of 30.1 percent increased 243 basis points compared with the same period in fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher supply chain, marketing and technology expenses associated with the Company's growth initiatives. In addition, the increase reflected a one-time investment in its employees associated with corporate tax reform, performance-related adjustments based on company performance and a legal settlement gain of $22 million in 2016.\nFULL YEAR SUMMARY\nFull year net earnings were $437 million and EBIT was $926 million, or 6.1 percent of net sales, compared with net earnings of $354 million and EBIT of $805 million, or 5.6 percent of net sales, for the same period in fiscal 2016. Retail EBIT increased $44 million relative to last year, primarily reflecting a goodwill impairment charge of $197 million in 2016. Credit EBIT increased $77 million relative to last year due to higher credit card revenues. Total Company net sales of $15.1 billion for fiscal year 2017 increased 4.4 percent, inclusive of approximately $220 million, or 150 basis points, from the 53rd week, compared with net sales of $14.5 billion during the same period in fiscal 2016. Total Company comparable sales for the fiscal year 2017 increased 0.8 percent. Retail gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, of 34.7 percent decreased 18 basis points compared with fiscal 2016 primarily due to higher occupancy expenses related to new store growth for Nordstrom Rack and Canada. Selling, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, of 30.8 percent increased 104 basis points compared with fiscal 2016 due to technology and performance-related expenses. The Company made meaningful progress in improving operational efficiencies, reflected by moderated expense growth related to supply chain, technology, and marketing of approximately 10 percent over the last two years, relative to an annual average of approximately 20 percent from 2010 through 2015. During the year, the Company repurchased 4.6 million shares of its common stock for $206 million. A total of approximately $414 million remains under existing share repurchase board authorizations. The Company does not plan to repurchase any shares while members of the Nordstrom family explore the possibility of a \"going private transaction.\" The actual timing, price, manner and amounts of future share repurchases, if any, will be subject to market and economic conditions and applicable Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Return on invested capital (ROIC) for the 12 months ended February 3, 2018 was 9.7 percent compared with 8.4 percent in the prior 12-month period. Results for the prior period were negatively impacted by approximately 330 basis points due to the Trunk Club non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2016. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to the closest GAAP measure is included below.\nEXPANSION UPDATE\nNordstrom has announced plans to open the following stores in fiscal 2018, consisting of one new full-line store, 12 new Nordstrom Rack stores and one Nordstrom Rack store relocation:\nLocation Store Name Square\nFootage\n(000's)\nTiming Nordstrom - U.S. Men's Store New York, New York Nordstrom Men's Store NYC 47 April 12 Nordstrom Rack - U.S. Bridgewater, New Jersey Chimney Rock Crossing 36 March Lancaster County, Pennsylvania Shoppes at Belmont 25 March Shenandoah, Texas Portofino Shopping Center 27 March Santa Clarita, California Promenade at Town Center 30 April Long Beach, California Long Beach Exchange 1 28 May Gilbert, Arizona SanTan Village 25 September Vernon Hills, Illinois Mellody Farm 30 September Nordstrom Rack - Canada Toronto, Ontario Vaughan Mills 35 March Calgary, Alberta Deerfoot Meadows 31 April Toronto, Ontario One Bloor 39 May Mississauga, Ontario Heartland Town Centre 35 September Edmonton, Alberta South Edmonton Common 35 October Ottawa, Ontario The Ottawa Train Yards 35 October 1 Nordstrom plans to relocate its Rack store at Lakewood Center in Lakewood to the nearby Long Beach Exchange.\nNumber of stores February 3, 2018 January 28, 2017 Nordstrom full-line – U.S. 1 117 118 Nordstrom full-line – Canada 6 5 Nordstrom Rack 232 215 Other 2 11 11 Total 366 349 1 Nordstrom full-line - U.S. total includes the Nordstrom Local store in California. 2 Other includes Trunk Club clubhouses, Jeffrey boutiques and Last Chance clearance stores. Gross square footage 30,218,000 29,792,000 FISCAL YEAR 2018 GUIDANCE\nThe Company's expectations for fiscal 2018 are as follows:\nNet sales $15.2 to $15.4 billion Comparable sales (percent) 0.5 to 1.5 EBIT $885 to $940 million Earnings per diluted share (excluding the impact of any future share repurchase) $3.30 to $3.55 The Company's guidance also incorporates the following assumptions:\nThe effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 27.5 percent. The impact of revenue recognition accounting changes is estimated to reduce EBIT by approximately $30 million. The 53rd week in fiscal 2017 creates a timing shift in the 4-5-4 calendar for fiscal 2018 that is expected to impact comparisons to the prior year. This includes the shift in the Anniversary Sale event from the second and third quarters in 2017 to primarily the second quarter in 2018.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION CHANGES\nThe Company is increasingly managing its business through two brands, Nordstrom full-price and Nordstrom Rack off-price. With customers increasingly engaging with Nordstrom through multiple ways, the Company is focused on providing a seamless experience across stores and online.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2018, Nordstrom plans to make the following reporting changes to align with how management will view the results of operations:\nallocation of the Credit business to the Nordstrom full-price and Nordstrom off-price businesses, resulting in one reportable segment allocation of certain corporate adjustments, such as sales return reserves, to the Nordstrom full-price and Nordstrom off-price businesses Nordstrom full-price and Nordstrom Rack off-price sales aggregated for stores and online\nThese changes are not expected to impact total Company net earnings, earnings per share, financial position or cash flows. In addition, the Company will also adopt the revenue recognition accounting changes beginning in fiscal 2018.\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nThe Company's senior management will host a conference call to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 results and fiscal 2018 outlook at 4:45 p.m. Eastern Standard Time today.

In addition, we incorporate ROIC in our executive incentive compensation measures. For the 12 fiscal months ended February 3, 2018, our ROIC increased to 9.7% compared with 8.4% for the 12 fiscal months ended January 28, 2017. Results for the prior period were negatively impacted by approximately 330 basis points due to the Trunk Club non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2016.\nWe define ROIC as our net operating profit after tax divided by our average invested capital using the trailing 12-month average. ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, return on assets, net earnings, total assets or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies' methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to ROIC is return on assets. The following is a reconciliation of the components and adjustments to ROIC and return on assets:\n12 Fiscal Months Ended February 3, 2018 January 28, 2017 Net earnings $ 437 $ 354 Add: income tax expense 1 353 330 Add: interest expense 141 122 Earnings before interest and income tax expense 931 806 Add: rent expense 250 202 Less: estimated depreciation on capitalized operating leases 2 (133 ) (108 ) Net operating profit 1,048 900 Less: estimated income tax expense (468 ) (416 ) Net operating profit after tax $ 580 $ 484 Average total assets $ 8,055 $ 7,917 Less: average non-interest-bearing current liabilities 3 (3,261 ) (3,012 ) Less: average deferred property incentives and deferred rent liability 3 (644 ) (644 ) Add: average estimated asset base of capitalized operating leases 4 1,805 1,512 Average invested capital $ 5,955 $ 5,773 Return on assets 5 5.4 % 4.5 % ROIC 5 9.7 % 8.4 % 1 Results for the 12 months ended February 3, 2018 include $42 impact related to U.S. corporate tax reform.\n2 Capitalized operating leases is our best estimate of the asset base we would record for our leases that are classified as operating if they had met the criteria for a capital lease or we had purchased the property. Asset base is calculated as described in footnote 3 below.\n3 Balances associated with our deferred rent liability have been classified as long-term liabilities in the current period.\n4 Based upon the trailing 12-month average of the monthly asset base. The asset base for each month is calculated as the trailing 12 months of rent expense multiplied by eight. The multiple of eight times rent expense is a commonly used method of estimating the asset base we would record for our capitalized operating leases described in footnote 1.\n5 Results for the 12 months ended January 28, 2017 include the $197 impact of the Trunk Club non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2016, which negatively impacted the prior period return on assets by approximately 240 basis points and ROIC by approximately 330 basis points.\nNORDSTROM, INC.\nADJUSTED DEBT TO EBITDAR (NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)\n(unaudited; dollar amounts in millions)\nAdjusted Debt to EBITDAR is one of our key financial metrics, and we believe that our debt levels are best analyzed using this measure. Our goal is to manage debt levels to maintain an investment-grade credit rating and operate with an efficient capital structure. In evaluating our debt levels, this measure provides a reflection of our credit worthiness that could impact our credit rating and borrowing costs. We also have a debt covenant that requires an adjusted debt to EBITDAR leverage ratio of no more than four times. As of February 3, 2018, our Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR was 2.6, and as of January 28, 2017 it was 2.4.\nAdjusted Debt to EBITDAR is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, debt to net earnings, net earnings, debt or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies' methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR is debt to net earnings. The following is a reconciliation of the components of Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR and debt to net earnings:\n2017 1 2016 1 Debt $ 2,737 $ 2,774 Add: estimated capitalized operating lease liability 2 2,001 1,616 Less: fair value hedge adjustment included in long-term debt — (12 ) Adjusted Debt $ 4,738 $ 4,378 Net earnings $ 437 $ 354 Add: income tax expense 353 330 Add: interest expense, net 136 121 Earnings before interest and income taxes 926 805 Add: depreciation and amortization expenses 666 645 Add: rent expense 250 202 Add: non-cash acquisition-related charges 3 1 198 EBITDAR $ 1,843 $ 1,850 Debt to Net Earnings 4 6.3 7.8 Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR 2.6 2.4 1 The components of Adjusted Debt are as of February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017, while the components of EBITDAR are for the 12 months ended February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017.\n2 Based upon the estimated lease liability as of the end of the period, calculated as the trailing 12 months of rent expense multiplied by eight. The multiple of eight times rent expense is a commonly used method of estimating the debt we would record for our leases that are classified as operating if they had met the criteria for a capital lease or we had purchased the property.\n3 Non-cash acquisition-related charges for the 12 months ended January 28, 2017 included the goodwill impairment charge of $197 related to Trunk Club.\n4 Results for the period ended January 28, 2017 include the $197 impact of the Trunk Club goodwill impairment charge, which approximates 280 basis points.\nNORDSTROM, INC.\nFREE CASH FLOW (NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE)\n(unaudited; amounts in millions)\nFree Cash Flow is one of our key liquidity measures, and when used in conjunction with GAAP measures, provides investors with a meaningful analysis of our ability to generate cash from our business. For the year ended February 3, 2018, we had Free Cash Flow of $383 compared with $560 for the year ended January 28, 2017.\nFree Cash Flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, operating cash flows or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies' methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow is net cash provided by operating activities. The following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow:\nYear Ended February 3, 2018 January 28, 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,400 $ 1,658 Less: capital expenditures (731 ) (846 ) Less: cash dividends paid (247 ) (256 ) Add: proceeds from sale of credit card receivables originated at third parties 16 — (Less) Add: change in cash book overdrafts (55 ) 4 Free Cash Flow $ 383 $ 560\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180301006277/en/\nNordstrom, Inc.\nInvestors:\nTrina Schurman, 206-303-6503\nor\nMedia:\nGigi Ganatra Duff, 206-303-3030\nSource: Nordstrom, Inc.",
