    "text": "ST. ALBERT, Alberta, March 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Enterprise Group, Inc. (TSX:E) (the “ Company ” or “ Enterprise ”) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a non-binding letter of intent for the sale of the assets of its trenchless solutions business unit, Calgary Tunnelling & Horizontal Augering (“ CTHA ”), to a private arm’s length purchaser.\nPursuant to the terms of the letter of intent, Enterprise proposes to sell all of the assets relating to the business carried on by CTHA for total proceeds of approximately $21 million, subject to certain adjustments for inventory and working capital. All proceeds from the transaction would be used to reduce Enterprise’s debt.

Completion of the transaction is subject to negotiation of a definitive agreement, finalization of satisfactory due diligence, obtaining third party consents and approvals and other customary closing conditions.\nCompletion of the transaction allows the company to pursue several attractive growth opportunities in the specialty equipment rental space. Management intends to focus its forward attention on the equipment rental sector.\nFor questions or additional information, please contact:\nLeonard Jaroszuk, President & CEO, or\nDesmond O’Kell, Senior Vice-President\n780-418-4400\ncontact@enterprisegrp.ca\nForward Looking Information\nCertain statements contained in this news release constitute forward-looking information.
