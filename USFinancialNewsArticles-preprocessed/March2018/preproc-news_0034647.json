    "text": "March 20, 2018 / 11:10 AM / Updated 22 minutes ago EU dissects Poland's defense of contested judicial reforms Gabriela Baczynska , Philip Blenkinsop 4 Min Read BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Germany and Denmark told Poland on Tuesday to adhere to the rule of law, as EU ministers gathered in Brussels to analyze Warsaw’s defense of a court overhaul that the bloc says weakens democracy. Poland, the biggest of the former communist EU states, stands accused of subjecting its courts to more government control since the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party won power in late 2015. The bloc has threatened to mete out unprecedented punishment, including the ‘nuclear option’ of suspending Warsaw’s vote, if Poland does not restore the damaged checks and balances. “Everybody knows what is at stake here, it’s very, very important that we stick to the common rules and that goes also to Poland,” Danish Foreign Affairs Minister Anders Samuelsen told reporters on arriving at the talks in Brussels. Samuelsen was on his way to share his analysis with EU peers after Warsaw published a ‘white paper’ defending the judicial changes on the grounds of improving efficiency and accountability by removing judges who prospered under post-World War Two communism in Poland, which came to an end in 1989. After a two-year feud between Warsaw and the more liberal, western EU states, Poland’s new Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has reopened dialogue with the Brussels-based EU executive European Commission on the matter. Germany’s EU minister Michael Roth said Poland, which may risk losing billions of euros in EU handouts as an indirect consequence of the dispute, must not just play for time. “Talking for talking’s sake is not enough and I hope that today... will give a clear signal that EU members support the European Commission in this essential matter,” he said. The Commission has given Poland until Tuesday to restore the rule of law, or risk proceedings under the so-called Article 7 punishment mechanism. Warsaw has until the end of the day to come up with its formal answer to that. The top sanction of stripping Poland of its voting rights is all but certain not to materialize as Warsaw’s ally Hungary - where the euroskeptic Prime Minister Viktor Orban has plenty of his own clashes with the EU - has vowed to block it. But the sole fact that the EU has been debating it, albeit reluctantly, for months now causes damage to Poland’s reputation and highlights its growing isolation in the EU. The bloc lacks hard tools to force Warsaw back into line on the courts specifically. But, as ties between Poland and the wealthier net payers to the EU’s joint coffers sour, the bad blood spills over, raising the risk that they would retaliate by stripping Warsaw of some funding in bloc’s the next, long-term budget from 2021. Speaking in Warsaw on Monday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel hoped Poland’s ruling nationalists would satisfy Europe’s concerns. Morawiecki responded that he hoped for a deal over the coming two months. Details, however, remain far from clear as Warsaw has given no indication it would be willing to backpedal on the contested reforms. Writing by Gabriela Baczynska; Editing by Peter Graff",
