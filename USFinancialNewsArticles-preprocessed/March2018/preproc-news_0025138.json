    "text": "ISTANBUL, March 9 (Reuters) - Turkey may respond with lasting measures in the face of U.S. steel tariff, aside from a previously mooted step on cotton imports, presidential adviser Cemil Ertem told state broadcaster TRT Haber on Friday.\nErtem, speaking after U.S. President Donald Trump pressed ahead with a 25 percent tariff on steel, said earlier this week that Turkey could retaliate against such a move by hiking duties on imports of American cotton.\nReporting by Behiye Selin Taner; Writing by Daren Butler; Editing by David Dolan\n ",
