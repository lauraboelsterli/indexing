    "text": "NEWARK, N.J., March 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- IDT Corporation (NYSE: IDT) reported EPS of $0.06 on revenue of $395.9 million for the second quarter of FY 2018, the three months ended January 31, 2018.\nHIGHLIGHTS\n(2Q18 results are compared to 2Q17)\nThe spin-off of Rafael Holdings to IDT stockholders has been scheduled for on or about March 26 th ; IDT has declared a dividend of $0.09 per share for 2Q18; Revenue of $395.9 million compared to $367.6 million; Loss from operations of $0.5 million compared to income from operations of $3.1 million; Adjusted EBITDA* of $6.3 million compared to $9.3 million; EPS of $0.06 compared to EPS of $0.04; Non-GAAP EPS* of $0.00 compared to $0.12; The sale of IDT's Gibraltar-based bank remains pending regulatory approval.\n*Throughout this release, non-GAAP EPS, Adjusted EBITDA, and non-GAAP Net Income for all periods presented are non-GAAP measures intended to provide useful information that supplements IDT's or the relevant segment's core results in accordance with GAAP. Please refer to the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this release for an explanation of these terms and their respective reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nREMARKS BY SHMUEL JONAS, CEO OF IDT CORPORATION\n\"Last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission concluded its review of our spin-off of Rafael Holdings. As previously announced, we now expect to distribute the Rafael Holdings shares to our stockholders on or about March 26th. The spin-off of Rafael Holdings will include our pharma investments and over $100 million of real estate, cash, marketable securities and investments.\n\"IDT's consolidated revenue of $395.9 million in the second quarter represents a $28.3 million increase compared to the year ago quarter. The revenue growth was contributed by two verticals - Wholesale Carrier, which generated its sixth consecutive quarter of revenue increases and Payment Services, reflecting increases in money remittance transactions originating from our direct to consumer channels and by sales of international and domestic mobile top-up. Retail Communications revenue decreased, but we have slowed the rate of decline while improving Retail's margin contribution.\n\"Our growth initiatives are performing well and have begun to contribute significantly to our top line growth. Looking ahead, we will be reducing our SG&A spend, primarily in our legacy offerings, while continuing to maintain and support the investment behind our growth initiatives.\n\"In light of our intention to continue to invest heavily in our promising growth initiatives and the impact of the spin-off of Rafael on our balance sheet, IDT's Board of Directors has reduced our dividend for the second quarter to $0.09 per share.\"\n2Q18 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS\n(Results are for 2Q18 and compared to 2Q17 unless otherwise noted).\nResults\n(in millions, except EPS)\n2Q18\n1Q18\n2Q17\n2Q18 - 2Q17\nChange (%/$)\nRevenue\n$395.9\n$393.6\n$367.6\n+7.7%\nDirect cost of revenue\n$337.2\n$336.5\n$310.9\n+8.5%\nDirect cost of revenue as a percentage\nof revenue\n85.2%\n85.5%\n84.6%\n+60 BP\nSG&A expense\n$52.4\n$50.1\n$47.3\n+10.6%\nDepreciation and amortization\n$5.7\n$5.7\n$5.3\n+8.2%\n(Loss) income from operations\n$(0.5)\n$0.1\n$3.1\n$(3.6)\nAdjusted EBITDA*\n$6.3\n$7.0\n$9.3\n$(3.0)\nNet income (loss) attributable to IDT\n$1.5\n$(2.1)\n$0.9\n+$0.6\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share\n$0.06\n$(0.08)\n$0.04\n+$0.02\nNon-GAAP net income*\n$0.0\n$0.2\n$2.7\n$(2.7)\nNon-GAAP EPS*\n$0.00\n$0.01\n$0.12\n$(0.12)\nConsolidated results for all periods presented include corporate overhead as a separate segment. The corporate segment loss from operations decreased to $3.3 million from $3.7 million in 2Q17 primarily because of a decrease in stock-based compensation, which declined to $632 thousand from $1.0 million.\nNet income attributable to IDT in 2Q18 was $1.5 million or $0.06 per diluted share, including a benefit from income taxes of $3.3 million as a result of a change in US tax law, compared to net income attributable to IDT of $0.9 million or $0.04 per diluted share in 2Q17.\nAt January 31, 2018, IDT held $100.3 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. At the time of the spin-off, Rafael Holdings will have approximately $44 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as $6 million in hedge fund investments and other investment securities. The hedge fund and securities holdings are currently included in \"Investments\" on the balance sheet.\nNet cash provided by operating activities during 2Q18 was $3.5 million compared to net cash used in operating activities of $6.3 million in 2Q17. In the same periods, capital expenditures were $5.6 million and $5.0 million, respectively.\n2Q18 RESULTS BY SEGMENT\n(Results are for 2Q18 and compared to 2Q17 unless otherwise noted).\nQuarterly Results by\nSegment\n(in millions)\nTPS\nnet2phone-UCaaS\nAll Other\nCorporate\n2Q18\n2Q17\n2Q18\n2Q17\n2Q18\n2Q17\n2Q18\n2Q17\nRevenue\n$387.1\n$359.9\n$8.3\n$7.1\n$0.5\n$0.5\n-\n-\nDirect cost of revenue\n$334.6\n$308.0\n$2.6\n$2.9\n-\n-\n-\n-\nSG&A expense\n$43.5\n$40.8\n$5.3\n$3.8\n$1.1\n-\n$2.4\n$2.8\nDepreciation and\namortization\n$4.1\n$4.0\n$1.2\n$0.9\n$0.4\n$0.4\n-\n-\nIncome (loss) from\noperations\n$4.6\n$7.2\n$(0.8)\n$(0.5)\n$(1.0)\n$0.1\n$(3.3)\n$(3.7)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$8.9\n$11.2\n$0.4\n$0.4\n$(0.6)\n$0.5\n$(2.4)\n$(2.8)\nTelecom Platform Services (TPS)\nTPS is comprised of communications and payment offerings grouped in three broad verticals: Retail Communications, Wholesale Carrier Services and Payment Services. Effective 1Q18, TPS' Retail Communications vertical also includes the results of IDT's Consumer Phone Services (CPS). CPS was previously reported as a separate segment. All comparative prior periods have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation. The TPS segment contributed 97.8% of IDT's consolidated revenue in 2Q18 and 97.9% in 2Q17.\nTPS' 2Q18 revenue increased 7.5% to $387.1 million. Consistent with recent trends, the Wholesale Carrier Services and Payment Services verticals achieved robust revenue growth – more than offsetting a decline in Retail Communications' revenue.\nTPS' Revenue by\nBusiness Vertical\n($ in millions)\n2Q18\n1Q18\n2Q17\n2Q18 - 2Q17\n% Change\nin Revenue\n2Q18-2Q17\n% Change in\nMinutes of Use\n2Q18\nRevenue as\n% of all\nTPS\nRetail Communications\n$145.2\n$146.2\n$154.6\n(6.1)%\n(17.1)%\n37.5%\nWholesale Carrier\nServices\n$172.5\n$170.5\n$145.8\n+18.3%\n6.5%\n44.6%\nPayment Services\n$69.4\n$68.4\n$59.5\n+16.5%\nN/A\n17.9%\nTotal TPS\n$387.1\n$385.1\n$359.9\n+7.5%\n0.5%\n100.0%\nRetail Communications : IDT's flagship BOSS Revolution ® calling service – which accounted for over 90% of Retail Communications' revenue in 2Q18 - continued to be impacted by increased adoption of over-the-top voice and messaging, unlimited calling plans, as well as decreased immigration into the U.S. These long-term, market-wide trends resulted in a 4.2% reduction in BOSS Revolution calling service's revenue compared to the year ago quarter. The rate of decline has slowed in recent quarters. Revenue from other Retail Communications offerings, including the sale of traditional 'hard' prepaid calling cards in the U.S. and overseas, continued to decline in line with expectations.\nWholesale Carrier Services: Wholesale Carrier Services' revenue increased 18.3% as IDT's carrier service continued to gain market share. Wholesale Carrier Services' revenue has historically been more volatile than Retail Communications' revenue, and changes in revenue do not necessarily generate corresponding changes in gross profit.\nPayment Services: Payment services revenue increased 16.5% year over year primarily reflecting growth in mobile top-up sales, which comprise 90% of Payment Services' revenue. Sales generated by the BOSS Revolution international money transfer service, primarily from its direct to consumer offering (app and web) and from National Retail Solutions' merchant services offerings, also increased.\nTPS' direct cost of revenue expressed as a percentage of revenue increased to 86.4% from 85.6%. This increase reflects margin pressure on Wholesale Carrier Services' offerings and a shift of revenue mix within TPS towards Wholesale Carrier Services, which generates relatively lower gross margins than Retail Communications' offerings. In contrast, Retail Communications' margins continued to improve during 2Q18.\nTPS' SG&A expense - $43.5 million – increased 6.8% from 2Q17, primarily on higher personnel and credit card processing costs. Expressed as a percentage of revenue, SG&A expense decreased to 11.2% from 11.3% in the year ago quarter. TPS' depreciation and amortization expense increased slightly to $4.1 million from $4.0 million in 2Q17.\nTPS' income from operations decreased to $4.6 million, including the impact of $0.2 million in severance expense, from $7.2 million in 2Q17, as the increase in SG&A expense outpaced TPS' increase in revenue less direct cost. Adjusted EBITDA decreased to $8.9 million in 2Q18 from $11.2 million in 2Q17.\nnet2phone - Unified Communications as a Service (UCaaS)\nThe net2phone-UCaaS segment is comprised of offerings from IDT's net2phone ® division, including its cloud communications and SIP trunking offerings for businesses, and its cable telephony service.\nnet2phone-UCaaS' 2Q18 revenue increased to $8.3 million from $7.1 million in 2Q17, driven by the rapid growth in its cloud-based communications offering – both in the U.S. and in South America.\nnet2phone-UCaaS' 2Q18 loss from operations was $790 thousand compared to a loss from operations of $464 thousand in 2Q17, reflecting increased sales commissions and other personnel costs. IDT continues to invest in the proprietary technologies that power net2phone's unified cloud communications offerings, and to finance front-loaded sales and commission expenses.\nAll Other\nAll Other includes interests in clinical stage pharmaceutical companies, Rafael Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Lipomedix Pharmaceuticals Ltd., both of which are developing cancer therapies, as well as IDT's real estate holdings, comprised of its public garage in Newark and commercial properties in Newark, Piscataway and Jerusalem, and other small businesses and investments.\nAll Other's financial results for 2Q18 were consistent with expectations.\nIDT's subsidiary, Rafael Holdings, owns IDT's real estate and pharmaceutical holdings included in All Other. IDT expects to effectuate the spin-off of Rafael Holdings on or about March 26, 2018.\nDIVIDEND\nIn light of IDT's commitment to continue investment in its growth initiatives and the impact of the spin-off of Rafael Holdings on the company's balance sheet, on March 5, 2018, IDT's Board of Directors reduced the company's dividend, declaring a quarterly dividend of $0.09 per share of IDT's Class A and Class B common stock for 2Q18 to be paid on or about March 23, 2018. The dividend will be paid to stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 19 th . This distribution will be treated as a return of capital for tax purposes.\nIDT EARNINGS ANNOUNCEMENT & SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\nThis release is available for download in the \"For Investors\" section of the IDT Corporation website ( http://idt.net/ir ) and has been filed on a current report (Form 8-K) with the SEC.\nIDT will host an earnings conference call today beginning today at 5:30 PM Eastern with management's discussion of results, outlook and strategy followed by Q&A with investors.\nTo listen to the call and participate in the Q&A, dial toll-free 1-888-348-8417 (from U.S.) or 1-412-902-4243 (international) and request the IDT Corporation call.\nA recording of the conference call can be accessed approximately two hours after the call concludes through March 13, 2018, by dialing 1-844-512-2921 (toll-free from the US) or 1-412-317-6671 (international) and providing this call number: 10117078.

accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), IDT also disclosed, for 2Q18, 1Q18 and 2Q17, Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share, which are non-GAAP measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nIDT's measure of Adjusted EBITDA consists of revenues less direct cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expense. Another way of calculating Adjusted EBITDA is to start with income from operations, and add depreciation and amortization, severance expense and other operating expense.\nIDT's measure of non-GAAP net income starts with net income (loss) in accordance with GAAP and adds severance expense, stock-based compensation, and other operating expense, and subtracts the income tax benefits from The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the release of the valuation allowance and full recognition of deferred tax assets.\nIDT's measure of non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share is calculated by dividing non-GAAP net income (loss) by the basic or diluted weighted-average shares.\nThese additions and subtractions are non-cash and/or non-routine items in the relevant fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 periods.\nManagement believes that IDT's Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses and non-routine gains and losses that may not be indicative of IDT's or the relevant segment's core operating results. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, among other measures, as a relevant indicator of core operational strengths in its financial and operational decision making. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share to evaluate operating performance in relation to IDT's competitors. Disclosure of these financial measures may be useful to investors in evaluating performance and allows for greater transparency to the underlying supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. In addition, IDT has historically reported similar financial measures and believes such measures are commonly used by readers of financial information in assessing performance, therefore the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in financial reporting at this time.\nManagement refers to Adjusted EBITDA, as well as the GAAP measures income (loss) from operations and net income (loss), on a segment and/or consolidated level to facilitate internal and external comparisons to the segments' and IDT's historical operating results, in making operating decisions, for budget and planning purposes, and to form the basis upon which management is compensated.\nWhile depreciation and amortization are considered operating costs under GAAP, these expenses primarily represent the non-cash current period allocation of costs associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior periods. IDT's Adjusted EBITDA, which is exclusive of depreciation and amortization, is a useful indicator of its current performance.\nSeverance expense is excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share. Severance expense is reflective of decisions made by management in each period regarding the aspects of IDT's and its segments' businesses to be focused on in light of changing market realities and other factors. While there may be similar charges in other periods, the nature and magnitude of these charges can fluctuate markedly and do not reflect the performance of IDT's core and continuing operations.\nOther operating expense is a component of income (loss) from operations. In fiscal 2018, other operating expense included legal fees related to potential liabilities and claims under agreements related to IDT's spin-off in 2013 of Straight Path Communications Inc., and fees related to other legal matters. In fiscal 2017, other operating expense included legal fees related to an FCC inquiry, which was also related to IDT's prior ownership of Straight Path Communications Inc. Other operating expense is excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share. From time-to-time, IDT may incur costs related to non-routine legal and regulatory matters. However, such legal and regulatory matters do not occur each quarter. IDT does not believe the gains or losses from non-routine legal and regulatory matters are components of IDT's or the relevant segment's core operating results.\nThe other calculation of Adjusted EBITDA consists of revenues less direct cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expense. As the other excluded items are not reflected in this calculation, they are excluded automatically and there is no need to make additional adjustments. This calculation results in the same Adjusted EBITDA amount and its utility and significance is as explained above.\nStock-based compensation recognized by IDT and other companies may not be comparable because of the variety of types of awards as well as the various valuation methodologies and subjective assumptions that are permitted under GAAP. Stock-based compensation is excluded from IDT's calculation of non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share because management believes this allows investors to make more meaningful comparisons of the operating results per share of IDT's core business with the results of other companies. However, stock-based compensation will continue to be a significant expense for IDT for the foreseeable future and an important part of employees' compensation that impacts their performance.\nIn 2Q18, IDT recorded an income tax benefit of $3.3 million for its anticipated AMT credit refund due to The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. In 1Q17, IDT recorded a foreign income tax benefit of $16.6 million from the release of the valuation allowance and full recognition of certain deferred tax assets. These income tax benefits are excluded from IDT's calculation of non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share because the benefits were not directly related to the current results of IDT's core operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, income (loss) from operations, cash flow from operating activities, net income (loss), basic and diluted earnings per share or other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, IDT's measurements of Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nFollowing are reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which are, (a) for Adjusted EBITDA, income (loss) from operations for IDT's reportable segments and net income for IDT on a consolidated basis, (b) for non-GAAP net income (loss), net income (loss) and, (c) for non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share, basic and diluted earnings per share.\nIDT Corporation\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income (Loss)\n(unaudited)\nin millions\nFigures may not foot or cross-foot
