    "text": "(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co has appointed James Roddy global co-head of diversified industries and head of its North America diversified industries group within its investment banking division, according to people familiar with the matter.\nRoddy’s appointment comes after his predecessor David Walker was named by JPMorgan as vice chairman of investment banking. Roddy’s new role was announced internally earlier this month, the sources said.\nRoddy was previously head of JPMorgan’s regional investment banking and M&A coverage. M&A bankers reporting to him in his previous role are now reporting to Anu Aiyengar, JPMorgan’s head of North American M&A, according to the sources.\nRoddy will report to JPMorgan’s head of investment banking Eric Stein, the sources said.\nJPMorgan offered no comment.\nThe changes in JPMorgan’s industrials team come after the bank lost one of its top industrial bankers last month, investment banking vice chairman Chris Gallea, to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\n(This version of the story corrects reference to bankers reporting to Aiyengar in paragraph 3)\nReporting by Greg Roumeliotis and Harry Brumpton in New York; Editing by Marguerita Choy\n ",
