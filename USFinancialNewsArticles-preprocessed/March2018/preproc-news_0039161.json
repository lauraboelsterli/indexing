Mar 21, 2018; Key Biscayne, FL, USA; Alize Cornet of France hits a backhand against Bethanie Mattek-Sands of the United States (not pictured) on day two of the Miami Open at Tennis Center at Crandon Park. Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports Frenchwoman Cornet needed one hour and 38 minutes to reach the second round before congratulating her opponent as the fans at Crandon Park cheered. It was a far different scene the last time Mattek-Sands was in action when she was carried off court on a stretcher screaming in pain after suffering an horrific knee injury during last year’s Wimbledon. Mattek-Sands was playing Romania’s Sorana Cirstea when she appeared to slip as she approached the net early in the third set before collapsing awkwardly to the grass. Mar 21, 2018; Key Biscayne, FL, USA; Bethanie Mattek-Sands of the United States prepares to serve against Alize Cornet of France (not pictured) on day two of the Miami Open at Tennis Center at Crandon Park. Geoff Burke-USA TODAY Sports After a moment’s silence, she suddenly screamed out in pain, then repeatedly shouted “help me” as she clutched her right leg. Medical personnel arrived and Mattek-Sands was treated on court for more than 20 minutes, during which time she was given oxygen and an injection. “I’m the most happy with the win, but secondly, is to see Bethanie back on court,” Cornet said. “She’s a great player and I was very sad last year for what happened to her at Wimbledon. “She’s already back and she’s playing damn good. I’m very happy to be through.” Reporting by Steve Keating in Toronto, Editing by Ed Osmond",
