    "text": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D., Raven Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:RAVN) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter that ended January 31, 2018.\nNoteworthy Items:\n• Consolidated net sales increased nearly 40 percent year-over-year, with all three divisions driving double-digit growth;\n• Diluted earnings per share increased 92 percent year-over-year, driven by significant operating leverage within Engineered Films;\n• Engineered Films continued to assist in hurricane recovery efforts, delivering $15.8 million of hurricane recovery film during the fourth quarter;\n• Applied Technology continued to drive growth despite lackluster market conditions, achieving sales growth of 18 percent year-over-year;\n• Aerostar's stratospheric balloon platform drove divisional sales growth of approximately 12 percent year-over-year.\nFourth Quarter Results:\nNet sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 were $95.8 million, up 39.0 percent versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Each division achieved double-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter, with Engineered Films achieving growth of more than 60 percent year-over-year. Delivery of hurricane recovery film to support relief efforts and the acquisition of Colorado Lining International, Inc. (CLI), which occurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, contributed sales of $15.8 million and $7.9 million, respectively.\nOperating income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $11.4 million versus operating income of $6.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, increasing 81.9 percent year-over-year. Operating margin increased 280 basis points year-over-year, from 9.1 percent of net sales to 11.9 percent of net sales. The significant improvement in profitability was principally driven by Engineered Films' improved margins and leverage of corporate expenses over significantly higher sales.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $8.4 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, versus net income of $4.4 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in last year's fourth quarter.\nIncluded in this year's fourth quarter financial results were costs related to the Company's Project Atlas initiative to replace its existing enterprise resource planning platform of $0.6 million ($0.4 million after-tax, or $0.01 per diluted share).\nFiscal Year 2018 Results:\nNet sales for fiscal year 2018 were $377.3 million, up 36.0 percent versus fiscal year 2017. All divisions experienced significant increases in sales during the year, with Engineered Films achieving growth of more than 50 percent year-over-year. Delivery of hurricane recovery film to support relief efforts and the acquisition of CLI contributed sales of $24.2 million and $13.1 million, respectively. Excluding CLI and hurricane recovery film, net sales for Engineered Films in fiscal 2018 were $176.0 million, up 26.7 percent year-over-year.\nOperating income for fiscal year 2018 was $59.2 million, up 108.2 percent, versus $28.4 million in fiscal 2017. Net income for fiscal year 2018 was $41.0 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, versus net income of $20.2 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, in fiscal year 2017.\nTax Reform:\nThe U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was enacted on December 22, 2017 and reduces the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018. The TCJA caused the Company’s fiscal 2018 U.S. federal statutory tax rate to be reduced by 1.2 percentage points, benefiting fiscal year 2018 net income by approximately $0.7 million. The Company expects its fiscal year 2019 effective tax rate to be approximately 21 percent, excluding discrete items. For fiscal year 2018, applying this new rate to the full year would have reduced tax expense by an additional $5 million as compared to reported results. The Company expects to re-invest its future tax savings back into the business to fund long-term growth initiatives and to train and develop our team members.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow:\nAt the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, cash and cash equivalents totaled $40.5 million, up $3.7 million versus the prior quarter. Continued strength in operating cash flows drove the increase in cash versus the prior quarter.\nNet working capital 1 as a percentage of annualized net sales decreased 160 basis points year-over-year, from 27.9 percent in the fourth quarter of last year to 26.3 percent in this year’s fourth quarter. The decrease in net working capital percentage 1 was the result of higher payables, as well as managing inventory and receivables efficiently with the substantial increase in sales versus the prior year.\nApplied Technology Division:\nNet sales for Applied Technology in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 were $30.5 million, up $4.6 million versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Geographically, domestic sales were up 21.1 percent year-over-year, and international sales were up 6.2 percent year-over-year. Despite continued lackluster market dynamics, the division continues to drive sales growth through successfully introducing new products and building on key OEM relationships.\nDivision operating income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $5.8 million, down $0.6 million or 8.7 percent versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The division continues to invest in research and development activities to position itself for incremental new product sales and market share gains in future years.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the division settled two outstanding legal matters on a confidential basis, including the Capstan Ag Systems, Inc. patent infringement litigation.\nEngineered Films Division:\nNet sales for Engineered Films were $55.6 million, up 61.0 percent year-over-year. The increase in net sales was driven by organic growth in the geomembrane and industrial markets, as well as delivery of recovery film to support hurricane relief efforts and the acquisition of CLI, which contributed $15.8 million and $7.9 million, respectively.\nOperating income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $11.9 million, up $6.6 million or 125.2 percent versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The year-over-year increase in operating income was principally driven by strong operating leverage on higher sales volume. Division operating margin increased 620 basis points year-over-year, from 15.3 percent to 21.5 percent, driven by operational efficiency gains developed throughout the year and higher sales volume improving capacity utilization.\nAerostar Division:\nNet sales for Aerostar during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 were $9.8 million, up $1.0 million or 11.8 percent versus the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. This increase in net sales was primarily driven by growth in the stratospheric balloon platform.\nDivision profit was down slightly due to unfavorable mix and contract timing. The current quarter results were not consistent with previous quarters or the Company's long-term expectations.\nFiscal 2019 Outlook:\n“We are very pleased with the performance achieved by all three operating divisions throughout fiscal 2018,” said Dan Rykhus, President and CEO. “Consolidated net sales were $377 million, and all three divisions achieved double-digit sales growth.\n“In fiscal 2018, Applied Technology achieved strong results in the face of challenging agricultural market conditions. We expect to continue to drive growth, and will continue to strategically fund several long-term investments. Subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter, the division launched a strategic initiative to grow its local presence in Brazil and drive organic growth in Latin America in order to better capitalize on one of the largest agricultural markets in the world.\n“Engineered Films demonstrated impressive operational discipline and sustained high plant utilization throughout the year. The division grew sales by approximately $75 million year-over-year, and prior investments in acquisitions and manufacturing capacity drove strong growth in every market served. The division continues to see opportunities for growth and is investing in additional capacity in fiscal 2019. As for hurricane recovery efforts, the delivery of recovery film will result in sales of approximately $9 million in the first quarter and then return to significantly reduced levels consistent with prior years.\n“During the year, Aerostar improved its financial performance and achieved consistency and stability in its results. The division continues to sharpen its focus on the stratospheric balloon platform and has divested of a few non-strategic portions of its business during and subsequent to the end of fiscal 2018. Strong performance on existing programs is driving confidence for continued growth with Aerostar’s stratospheric balloon platform.\n“Raven Industries is well positioned as we enter fiscal 2019 because of the actions taken and investments made to preserve and strengthen our core business. Furthermore, we are evaluating strategic acquisitions and will continue to invest in additional manufacturing capacity and technology development to enhance our core product lines. Our goal remains to generate 10 percent annualized earnings growth over the long-term, excluding unusual and generally non-recurring items.”\nRegulation G:\nThe information presented in this earnings release regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) do not conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with GAAP.
