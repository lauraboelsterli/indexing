No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nCautionary Language Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nInformation in this press release, including statements as to the expected timing, completion and effects of the Merger, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the rules regulations and releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of the Merger, including future financial and operating results and the Company’s or NJCB’s future expectations, beliefs, goals, plans or prospects. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact, including statements containing such words as “will,” “could,” “plans,” “intends,” “expect,” “believe,” “view,” “opportunity,” “allow,” “continues,” “reflects,” “typically,” “anticipate,” “estimated,” or similar expressions, should also be considered forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Readers should not place undue influence on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of the management of the Company and NJCB and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties outside of our control.\nAmong the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those described in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement; (2) delays in closing the Merger or other risks that any of the closing conditions to the Merger may not be satisfied in a timely manner; (3) the inability to realize expected cost savings and synergies from the Merger in the amounts or in the timeframe anticipated; (4) the diversion of management’s time from ongoing business operations due to issues relating to the Merger; (5) costs or difficulties relating to integration matters might be greater than expected; (6) material adverse changes in the Company’s or NJCB’s operations or earnings; (7) potential litigation in connection with the Merger; and (8) the inability to retain NJCB’s customers and employees.\nThere are important, additional factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements, including the factors described under “Business,” “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the Commission on March 19, 2018. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the overall economy and the interest rate environment; the ability of customers to repay their obligations; competition; significant changes in accounting, tax or regulatory practices and requirements; certain interest rate risks; and risks associated with speculative construction lending. Although management has taken certain steps to mitigate any negative effect of the aforementioned items, significant unfavorable changes could severely impact the assumptions used and could have an adverse effect on profitability. The Company undertakes no obligation to update, alter, or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nContact: Robert F.
