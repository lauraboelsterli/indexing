FILE PHOTO: Spain's Economy Minister Luis de Guindos talks to the media during a eurozone finance ministers meeting in Brussels, Belgium, February 19, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir De Guindos, the only candidate for the job, would replace Portugal’s Vitor Constancio, whose term expires on May 31. “The Governing Council had no objection to the proposed candidate, Mr Luis de Guindos, who is a person of recognized standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters,” the ECB said.
