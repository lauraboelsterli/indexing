    "text": "March 1, 2018 / 8:02 AM / Updated an hour ago CORRECTED-Ratings agency AM Best picks Amsterdam for EU subsidiary Reuters Staff 2 Min Read (Corrects Amsterdam to the Netherlands in para 7) LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - Specialist insurance ratings agency AM Best plans to set up a European Union subsidiary in Amsterdam this year to continue providing ratings throughout the EU after Britain leaves, it said on Thursday. The company joins a number of insurance companies that have announced EU subsidiaries in case Britain loses access to the single market after it quits the EU. “Our contingency plan assumes a hard Brexit, which means we need to be operational by March 2019,” Nick Charteris-Black, AM Best’s managing director for market development in EMEA, told Reuters. The company intends to have a physical presence in Amsterdam this summer, he said. AM Best plans to employ around 10 people in Amsterdam, Charteris-Black said, including ratings analysts. Its London ratings business currently has around 55 staff, and the Dutch staff would probably be a mix of existing London employees and new hires, Charteris-Black said. Amsterdam won out against other contenders on commercial considerations, ability to attract talent and ease of doing business, he said. Brussels, Dublin and Luxembourg have proved favoured locations for insurers so far. But British ship insurer Steamship last week said it was setting up a subsidiary in Rotterdam, and its rival UK P&I Club is also planning to set up in the Netherlands. AM Best is regulated by the European Securities and Markets Authority. Reporting by Carolyn Cohn, editing by Larry King",
