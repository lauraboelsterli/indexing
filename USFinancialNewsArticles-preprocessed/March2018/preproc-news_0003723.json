    "text": "HAMILTON, Bermuda, Feb. 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Third Point Reinsurance Ltd. (\"Third Point Re\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: TPRE) today announced results for its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nThird Point Re reported net income available to common shareholders of $44.3 million, or $0.42 per diluted common share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $46.7 million, or $(0.45) per diluted common share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Third Point Re reported net income available to common shareholders of $277.8 million, or $2.64 per diluted common share, compared to $27.6 million, or $0.26 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, diluted book value per share increased by $0.41 per share, or 2.7%, to $15.65 per share as of December 31, 2017, from $15.24 per share as of September 30, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, diluted book value per share increased by $2.49 per share, or 18.9%, to $15.65 per share from $13.16 per share as of December 31, 2016.\n\"Third Point Re generated a market leading return for its shareholders in 2017. Our return on equity was 2.8% in the fourth quarter bringing the full year to 20.1%, driven largely by strong investment performance,\" commented Rob Bredahl, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Despite high levels of natural catastrophes throughout 2017, we produced a combined ratio of 107.1% in the fourth quarter and 107.7% for the year. We have been encouraged by recent improvements in reinsurance terms and conditions and underlying pricing and expect our underwriting results to improve over the next 12 to 24 months. We remain confident that the improving underwriting environment and our proven investment strategy will continue to produce attractive returns for our shareholders over time.\"\nThe following table shows certain key financial metrics for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThree months ended\nTwelve months ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\n($ in millions, except for per share data and ratios)\nGross premiums written\n$\n164.2\n$\n80.8\n$\n641.6\n$\n617.4\nNet premiums earned\n$\n129.5\n$\n192.1\n$\n547.1\n$\n590.2\nNet underwriting loss (1)\n$\n(9.2)\n$\n(9.5)\n$\n(42.6)\n$\n(50.1)\nCombined ratio (1)\n107.1%\n105.0%\n107.7%\n108.5%\nNet investment return on investments managed by Third Point LLC\n2.7%\n(1.7)%\n17.7%\n4.2%\nNet investment income (loss)\n$\n67.2\n$\n(35.8)\n$\n392.0\n$\n98.8\nNet investment income (loss) on float (2)\n$\n20.6\n$\n(15.9)\n$\n114.4\n$\n16.9\nNet income (loss) available to Third Point Re common shareholders\n$\n44.3\n$\n(46.7)\n$\n277.8\n$\n27.6\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share available to Third Point Re\ncommon shareholders\n$\n0.42\n$\n(0.45)\n$\n2.64\n$\n0.26\nChange in diluted book value per share (2)\n2.7%\n(2.9)%\n18.9%\n2.4%\nReturn on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point\nRe common shareholders (2)\n2.8%\n(3.2)%\n20.1%\n2.0%\nNet investments managed by Third Point LLC\n$\n2,589.9\n$\n2,191.6\n$\n2,589.9\n$\n2,191.6\nInvested asset leverage\n1.56\n1.55\n1.56\n1.55\n(1)\nSee the accompanying Segment Reporting for a calculation of net underwriting loss and combined ratio.\n(2)\nNet investment income (loss) on float, change in diluted book value per share and return on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders are non-GAAP financial measures. There are no comparable GAAP measures. See the accompanying Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures and Key Performance Indicators for an explanation and calculation of net investment income (loss) on float, diluted book value per share and return on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders.\nProperty and Casualty Reinsurance Segment\nGross premiums written increased by $83.4 million, or 103.2%, to $164.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $80.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Gross premiums written increased by $24.2 million, or 3.9%, to $641.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 from $617.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nThe increase in gross premiums written for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the renewal of certain contracts in the current year period that did not have comparable premium in the prior year period. This increase was partially offset by lower premium adjustments in the current year period compared to the prior year. The increase for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to new contracts and increased premiums on renewals, partially offset by contracts that we did not renew as a result of underlying terms and conditions, lower premium adjustments in the current year and other timing differences.\nThe decrease in net premiums earned for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to a lower in-force underwriting portfolio. The decrease for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was partially offset by $109.4 million of new retroactive exposures in reinsurance contracts that were written and fully earned in the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to no retroactive reinsurance contracts written in the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nWe did not have any catastrophe losses for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The net underwriting results and combined ratio for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 included $5.3 million, or 1.0 percentage point, related to 2017 catastrophes. We recorded $2.5 million of net favorable reserve development for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, related to changes in estimates of prior years' loss reserves and the related impact of acquisition costs.\nThere was minimal net favorable reserve development for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The net underwriting results for the year ended December 31, 2016 included net adverse development of $12.5 million related to changes in estimates of prior years' loss reserves and the related impact of acquisition costs.\nInvestments\nThe return on investments managed by Third Point LLC by strategy for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:\nThree months ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nLong\nShort\nNet\nLong\nShort\nNet\nEquity\n4.5%\n(1.5)%\n3.0%\n(2.1)%\n(0.5)%\n(2.6)%\nCredit\n0.1%\n—%\n0.1%\n(0.1)%\n0.3%\n0.2%\nOther\n(0.3)%\n(0.1)%\n(0.4)%\n0.3%\n0.4%\n0.7%\nNet investment return on investments\nmanaged by Third Point LLC\n4.3%\n(1.6)%\n2.7%\n(1.9)%\n0.2%\n(1.7)%\nTwelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nLong\nShort\nNet\nLong\nShort\nNet\nEquity\n21.5%\n(4.6)%\n16.9%\n1.5%\n(2.9)%\n(1.4)%\nCredit\n0.7%\n(0.6)%\n0.1%\n6.4%\n(0.4)%\n6.0%\nOther\n1.8%\n(1.1)%\n0.7%\n0.5%\n(0.9)%\n(0.4)%\nNet investment return on investments\nmanaged by Third Point LLC\n24.0%\n(6.3)%\n17.7%\n8.4%\n(4.2)%\n4.2%\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the net investment results were driven by the equity portfolio with consumer, financials and industrials serving as the strongest performing sectors due to positive performance from long investments. The gains in the long equity portfolio were partially offset by losses in short positions, primarily from equity market hedges. The credit and other investments did not impact net returns meaningfully during the three month period.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the net investment results were primarily attributable to the equity portfolio. Within equities, we experienced positive returns across each long equity sector partially offset by losses from short positions, primarily from equity market hedges. One large long equity healthcare position was a notable contributor to the long equity performance for the year. Credit and the macroeconomic and other strategy, including currency and private investments, also contributed to positive performance with gains from the long exposures partially offset by short exposures in each strategy.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn February 28, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $148.3 million common shares, which together with the shares remaining under the previously announced share repurchase program will allow the Company to repurchase up to $200.0 million more of the Company's outstanding common shares in the aggregate. Under the common share repurchase program, the Company may repurchase shares from time to time in privately negotiated transactions or in open-market purchases in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations, including Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company may commence such repurchases immediately, subject to compliance with applicable securities laws. The Company expects to finance any repurchases from a combination of cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities. The timing, amount and method of any repurchases under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, the Company's capital position relative to internal and rating agency targets, legal requirements and other factors. The repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017, we did not repurchase any of our common shares.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased 3,300,152 of our common shares in the open market for $40.9 million at a weighted average cost, including commissions, of $12.38 per share. Common shares repurchased were not canceled and are classified as treasury shares.\nImpact of tax reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code. The following is a summary of the estimated impact of key elements of the Tax Act that could potentially impact the Company:\nBase Erosion Anti-abuse Tax (\"BEAT\")\nThe Company does not anticipate any impact from this provision of the Tax Act as it does not expect to meet the $500 million gross receipts threshold for application of the BEAT.\nOther impacts of changes to rate and other deductions\nAs a result of the changes in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, the Company has recorded a decrease in its net deferred tax liability resulting in an income tax benefit of $0.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company does not anticipate material changes to its effective tax rate as a result of the other changes to deductions within the Tax Act.\nPassive Foreign Investment Company (\"PFIC\")\nThe Tax Act modifies the active insurance exception to PFIC status by adding a requirement that loss and loss adjustment expenses and certain reserves must generally constitute more than 25% of the company's total assets for the relevant year. By adding an additional \"bright line\" test to the existing PFIC requirements, the Tax Act significantly increases the risk that a non-US insurer will be treated as a PFIC, even if it actively conducts insurance operations. There remain significant uncertainties as to the interpretation of the PFIC active insurance exception given the lack of final IRS regulations. We intend to restructure our investment account and manage our operations, in a way that prevents us from being classified as a PFIC.\nConference Call Details\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter 2017 results at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on March 1, 2018.

This portion of the noncontrolling interests had previously been presented in noncontrolling interests in related party within shareholders' equity when it should have been presented in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet as redeemable noncontrolling interests in related party. As of December 31, 2016, $31.2 million of the noncontrolling interest in related party should have been presented in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet as redeemable noncontrolling interests in related party. Although this impacted total shareholders' equity, it did not impact shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders or retained earnings. In addition, this change did not impact the consolidated statements of income, earnings per share or consolidated statement of cash flows. The Company has evaluated the effect of the incorrect presentation, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and concluded that it did not have a material impact on, nor require amendment of, any previously filed annual or quarterly consolidated financial statements or periodic reports.\nTHIRD POINT REINSURANCE LTD.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME (LOSS) (UNAUDITED)\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\n(expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars, except per share and share amounts)\nThree months ended\nTwelve months ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nRevenues\nGross premiums written\n$\n164,163\n$\n80,779\n$\n641,620\n$\n617,374\nGross premiums ceded\n75\n27\n(2,475)\n(2,325)\nNet premiums written\n164,238\n80,806\n639,145\n615,049\nChange in net unearned premium reserves\n(34,722)\n111,277\n(92,087)\n(24,859)\nNet premiums earned\n129,516\n192,083\n547,058\n590,190\nNet investment income (loss) before management and performance\nfees to related parties\n94,682\n(32,552)\n522,664\n158,532\nManagement and performance fees to related parties\n(27,532)\n(3,215)\n(130,711)\n(59,707)\nNet investment income (loss)\n67,150\n(35,767)\n391,953\n98,825\nTotal revenues\n196,666\n156,316\n939,011\n689,015\nExpenses\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses incurred, net\n99,509\n122,110\n370,058\n395,932\nAcquisition costs, net\n31,837\n76,854\n188,904\n222,150\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n14,299\n5,482\n53,103\n39,367\nOther expenses\n3,822\n2,161\n12,674\n8,387\nInterest expense\n2,074\n2,068\n8,225\n8,231\nForeign exchange (gains) losses\n2,067\n(5,162)\n12,300\n(19,521)\nTotal expenses\n153,608\n203,513\n645,264\n654,546\nIncome (loss) before income tax (expense) benefit\n43,058\n(47,197)\n293,747\n34,469\nIncome tax (expense) benefit\n2,104\n272\n(11,976)\n(5,593)\nNet income (loss)\n45,162\n(46,925)\n281,771\n28,876\nNet (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in related\nparty\n(813)\n232\n(3,973)\n(1,241)\nNet income (loss) available to Third Point Re common\nshareholders\n$\n44,349\n$\n(46,693)\n$\n277,798\n$\n27,635\nEarnings (loss) per share available to Third Point Re common\nshareholders\nBasic earnings (loss) per share available to Third Point Re common\nshareholders\n$\n0.44\n$\n(0.45)\n$\n2.71\n$\n0.26\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share available to Third Point Re common\nshareholders\n$\n0.42\n$\n(0.45)\n$\n2.64\n$\n0.26\nWeighted average number of common shares used in the\ndetermination of earnings (loss) per common share\nBasic\n101,405,772\n104,072,283\n102,264,094\n104,060,052\nDiluted\n105,524,115\n104,072,283\n105,227,038\n105,563,784\nTHIRD POINT REINSURANCE LTD.\nSEGMENT REPORTING\nThree months ended December 31, 2017\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2016\nProperty and\nCasualty\nReinsurance\nCorporate\nTotal\nProperty and\nCasualty\nReinsurance\nCorporate\nTotal\nRevenues\n($ in thousands)\n($ in thousands)\nGross premiums written\n$\n164,163\n$\n—\n$\n164,163\n$\n80,779\n$\n—\n$\n80,779\nGross premiums ceded\n75\n—\n75\n27\n—\n27\nNet premiums written\n164,238\n—\n164,238\n80,806\n—\n80,806\nChange in net unearned premium reserves\n(34,722)\n—\n(34,722)\n111,277\n—\n111,277\nNet premiums earned\n129,516\n—\n129,516\n192,083\n—\n192,083\nExpenses\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses incurred, net\n99,509\n—\n99,509\n122,110\n—\n122,110\nAcquisition costs, net\n31,837\n—\n31,837\n76,854\n—\n76,854\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n7,404\n6,895\n14,299\n2,633\n2,849\n5,482\nTotal expenses\n138,750\n6,895\n145,645\n201,597\n2,849\n204,446\nNet underwriting loss\n(9,234)\nn/a\nn/a\n(9,514)\nn/a\nn/a\nNet investment income (loss)\n20,578\n46,572\n67,150\n(15,937)\n(19,830)\n(35,767)\nOther expenses\n(3,822)\n—\n(3,822)\n(2,161)\n—\n(2,161)\nInterest expense\n—\n(2,074)\n(2,074)\n—\n(2,068)\n(2,068)\nForeign exchange gains (losses)\n—\n(2,067)\n(2,067)\n—\n5,162\n5,162\nIncome tax benefit\n—\n2,104\n2,104\n—\n272\n272\nNet (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\nin related party\n—\n(813)\n(813)\n—\n232\n232\nSegment income (loss)\n$\n7,522\n$\n36,827\n$\n(27,612)\n$\n(19,081)\nNet income (loss) available to Third Point Re\ncommon shareholders\n$\n44,349\n$\n(46,693)\nProperty and Casualty Reinsurance -

Basic book value per share, as presented, is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated by dividing shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders by the number of common shares outstanding shares, excluding the total number of unvested restricted shares, at period end. Diluted book value per share, as presented, is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents basic book value per share combined with the impact from dilution of all in-the-money share options issued, warrants and unvested restricted shares outstanding as of any period end. For unvested restricted shares with a performance condition, we include the unvested restricted shares for which we consider vesting to be probable. Change in basic book value per share is calculated by taking the change in basic book value per share divided by the beginning of period book value per share. Change in diluted book value per share is calculated by taking the change in diluted book value per share divided by the beginning of period diluted book value per share. We believe that long-term growth in diluted book value per share is the most important measure of our financial performance because it allows our management and investors to track over time the value created by the retention of earnings. In addition, we believe this metric is used by investors because it provides a basis for comparison with other companies in our industry that also report a similar measure.\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nBasic and diluted book value per share numerator:\n($ in thousands, except share and\nper share amounts)\nShareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders\n$\n1,656,089\n$\n1,414,051\nEffect of dilutive warrants issued to founders and an advisor\n46,512\n46,512\nEffect of dilutive stock options issued to directors and employees\n51,422\n52,930\nDiluted book value per share numerator\n$\n1,754,023\n$\n1,513,493\nBasic and diluted book value per share denominator:\nCommon shares outstanding\n103,282,427\n105,856,531\nUnvested restricted shares\n(1,873,588)\n(1,682,783)\nBasic book value per share denominator:\n101,408,839\n104,173,748\nEffect of dilutive warrants issued to founders and an advisor\n4,651,163\n4,651,163\nEffect of dilutive stock options issued to directors and employees\n5,123,531\n5,274,333\nEffect of dilutive restricted shares issued to directors and employees\n905,412\n878,529\nDiluted book value per share denominator\n112,088,945\n114,977,773\nBasic book value per share\n$\n16.33\n$\n13.57\nDiluted book value per share\n$\n15.65\n$\n13.16\nNet Investment Income (Loss) on Float\nNet investment income (loss) on float is an important aspect of our property and casualty reinsurance operation. In an insurance or reinsurance operation, float arises because premiums and proceeds from deposit accounted contracts are collected before losses are paid. In some instances, the interval between receipts and payments can extend over many years. During this time interval, insurance and reinsurance companies invest the premiums received and generate investment returns.We track cash flows generated by our property and casualty reinsurance operations, or float, in separate accounts that allow us to also track the net investment income (loss) generated on the float. We believe that net investment income (loss) generated on float is an important consideration in evaluating the overall contribution of our property and casualty reinsurance operation to our consolidated results. It is also explicitly considered as part of the evaluation of management's performance for purposes of long-term incentive compensation. Net investment income (loss) on float as presented is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the table below for a reconciliation of net investment income (loss) on float to net investment income (loss).\nThree months ended\nTwelve months ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\n($ in thousands)\nNet investment income (loss)\n$\n67,150\n$\n(35,767)\n$\n391,953\n$\n98,825\nLess:\nNet gain (loss) on investment in Kiskadee Fund\n(12)\n455\n(86)\n1,533\nNet investment income (loss) on investments managed by Third Point\nLLC\n67,162\n(36,222)\n392,039\n97,292\nLess:\nNet investment income (loss) on capital\n46,584\n(20,285)\n277,604\n80,361\nNet investment income (loss) on float\n$\n20,578\n$\n(15,937)\n$\n114,435\n$\n16,931\nReturn on Beginning Shareholders' Equity Attributable to Third Point Re Common Shareholders\nReturn on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders as presented is a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders is calculated by dividing net income (loss) available to Third Point Re common shareholders by the beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders. We believe that return on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders is an important measure because it assists our management and investors in evaluating the Company's profitability. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we have also adjusted the beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders for the impact of the shares repurchased on a weighted average basis. This adjustment increased the stated returns on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders.\nThree months ended\nTwelve months ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\n($ in thousands)\nNet income (loss) available to Third Point Re common shareholders\n$\n44,349\n$\n(46,693)\n$\n277,798\n$\n27,635\nShareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders\n- beginning of period\n1,612,154\n1,457,139\n1,414,051\n1,379,726\nImpact of weighting related to shareholders' equity from shares\nrepurchased\n—\n—\n(29,038)\n(4,363)\nAdjusted shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common\nshareholders - beginning of period\n$\n1,612,154\n$\n1,457,139\n$\n1,385,013\n$\n1,375,363\nReturn on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re\ncommon shareholders\n2.8%\n(3.2)%\n20.1%\n2.0%\nKey Performance Indicators\nNet Investment Return on Investments Managed by Third Point LLC\nNet investment return represents the return on our investments managed by Third Point LLC, net of fees. The net investment return on investments managed by Third Point LLC is the percentage change in value of a dollar invested over the reporting period on our investment assets managed by Third Point LLC, net of total noncontrolling interest. The stated return is net of withholding taxes, which are presented as a component of income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income (loss). Net investment return is the key indicator by which we measure the performance of Third Point LLC, our investment manager.\nInvested Asset Leverage\nInvested asset leverage is a ratio calculated by dividing our net investments managed by Third Point LLC by shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders and is a key metric in assessing the amount of insurance float generated by our reinsurance operation that has been invested by our investment manager, Third Point LLC. Given the sensitivity of our return on beginning shareholders' equity to our net investment return on investments managed by Third Point LLC, invested asset leverage is an important metric that management monitors. It is also an important metric by which we evaluate our capital adequacy for rating agency and regulatory purposes. Maintaining an appropriate invested asset leverage in order to optimize the return potential of the Company, while maintaining sufficient rating agency and regulatory capital is an important aspect of how we manage the Company.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/third-point-re-reports-fourth-quarter-2017-earnings-results-300606129.html\nSOURCE Third Point Reinsurance Ltd.",
