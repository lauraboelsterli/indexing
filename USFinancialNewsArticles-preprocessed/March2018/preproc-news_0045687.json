    "text": "BEDMINSTER, N.J., March 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Matinas BioPharma Holdings, Inc. (NYSE AMER:MTNB), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative anti-infectives for orphan indications, today formally announced its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n“During 2017, we made solid progress in our clinical development and the understanding of our proprietary cochleate platform delivery technology. We firmly believe in the potential of our lead product, MAT2203, and our streamlined development path moving forward towards addressing a significant unmet medical need in the prevention of invasive fungal infections (“IFIs”). In parallel, we continue to be aggressive in advancing our strategy to collaborate with established pharmaceutical companies to expand the utilization of our delivery technology,” commented Jerome D. Jabbour, Chief Executive Officer of Matinas .\n“In addition to recently articulating our short-term goals and milestones, we have also taken steps to properly focus our financial and human resources accordingly. Importantly, and as a direct result of this disciplined allocation of resources, we have successfully extended our cash runway into September 2018, which is at least an additional quarter beyond guidance provided with our third quarter 2017 results. We believe this will position the Company to execute through and beyond key value inflection points. Additionally, we plan to be opportunistic when, and if, we choose to access the capital markets,” added Mr. Jabbour.\nSUMMARY OF FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR 2017\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported a net loss of approximately $15.5 million, or a net loss per share basic and diluted of $0.36, compared to a net loss of approximately $7.6 million, or a net loss per share basic and diluted of $0.21, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 is attributable to the ongoing research and development activities related to the Company’s MAT2203 antifungal and MAT2501 antibacterial product candidates as well as the costs associated with operating as a public company.\nThe Company ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $7.3 million. Based on Management’s current projections the Company believes that cash on hand is sufficient to fund operations into September 2018.\nReceipt of Audit Opinion with Going Concern Qualification\nAs previously disclosed in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 16, 2018, the Company’s audited financial statements contained a going concern explanatory paragraph in the audit opinion from its independent registered public accounting firm. This announcement does not represent any change or amendment to the Company’s financial statements or to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nAbout Matinas BioPharma\nMatinas BioPharma is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative anti-infectives for orphan indications.
