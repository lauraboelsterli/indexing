    "text": "Tesla shares are on pace for their worst monthly performance as the electric car company faces a spate of recent issues.\nTesla stock is down 24.86 percent in March, as of Wednesday, pacing for its worst month since the company first went public in 2010.\nOther recent stock performance figures look pretty rough for Elon Musk's car company. Shares have fallen 17.21 percent in the quarter, putting it on track to record its worst quarter since the fourth quarter of 2013. On the week, Telsa is down 14.51 percent, with shares on track for their worst week since Feb. 5, 2016.\nRecent declines have come on the back of a federal investigation into a fatal car crash involving a Tesla vehicle in California earlier in the month. In response, Tesla has said it was assisting with investigations, although it also defended its Autopilot technology .\nMoody's recent downgrade of its corporate family rating on Tesla has also weighed on the stock.\nThe agency downgraded the company's credit ratings Tuesday and changed its outlook to negative from stable, citing \"significant shortfall\" in the Model 3 production rate and a tight financial situation.\nThose concerns were echoed by Morgan Stanley , which highlighted in a recent note that the company had to accelerate its Model 3 production if it wanted to raise funds at an attractive price.\nTelsa shares closed down 7.67 percent on Wednesday, some 30 percent off a record high touched in September last year.\nClarification: The report has been modified to better explain the nature of the federal government investigation of the crash in California.\nâ€” CNBC's Gina Francolla, Tae Kim and Evelyn Cheng contributed to this report.\nWATCH: Moody's downgrades Tesla due to Model 3 production delays show chapters Moody's downgrades Tesla due to Model 3 production delays 3:28 PM ET Wed, 28 March 2018 | 02:45",
