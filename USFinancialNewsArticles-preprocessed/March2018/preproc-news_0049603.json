    "text": "HOUSTON, March 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- American Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: AMID) (\"American Midstream\" or the \"Partnership\") announced that on March 27, 2018, a majority of the Southcross Energy Partners, L.P. (\"Southcross\") unitholders voted to approve the previously announced proposed merger with American Midstream.\nDuring a special meeting, unitholders voted on merger-related proposals, which included the merger and a non-binding advisory vote on merger compensation. The merger proposal passed with a vote of more than 95 percent of votes cast by non-affiliated unitholders, representing approximately 64 percent of all outstanding units held by such unitholders. A majority of the non-affiliated unitholders also approved the advisory merger compensation proposal.\nThe closing of the merger remains subject to certain state level regulatory approvals and the closing conditions described in the definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 13, 2018. The merger is expected to close later in the second quarter of 2018.\nAbout American Midstream Partners, LP\nAmerican Midstream Partners, LP is a growth-oriented limited partnership formed to provide critical midstream infrastructure that links producers of natural gas, crude oil, NGLs, condensate and specialty chemicals to end-use markets.
