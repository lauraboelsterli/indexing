The body of a Tesla Model S is transported by an automated crane at the Tesla factory in Fremont, California October 1, 2011. REUTERS/Stephen Lam The electric car maker told Reuters on Wednesday production of 100,000 Model S and Model X vehicles is now possible in a two-shift cycle with minimal overtime, compared with three shifts and considerable overtime earlier. Tesla was responding to a CNBC report that said the company was churning out a high ratio of flawed parts leading to costly rework and production delays, citing several current and former employees. The companyâ€™s shares closed down 4.4 percent at $326.63 on Wednesday. Reporting by Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila",
