    "text": "EditorsNote: Changes P.J. to PJ\nGerald Green drilled a corner 3-pointer at the buzzer, and the Houston Rockets extended their winning streak to 11 games with a 104-103 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Friday at Toyota Center.\nRookie Josh Jackson sank a pullup jumper with 1.4 seconds left to push Phoenix back in front after Rockets guard James Harden hit a game-tying 3-pointer with 12.2 seconds left. Harden had been 0-for-7 from behind the arc before momentarily knotting the score at 101-101.\nAfter Jackson scored the last of his team-high 27 points, Green took the inbounds pass from Trevor Ariza and buried his jumper in front of the Houston bench. He was mobbed by teammates as game officials reviewed the shot. The Rockets completed an unbeaten homestand and extended their winning streak at Toyota Center to 18 games.\nThe Suns dropped their 14th consecutive game in heartbreaking fashion. Troy Daniels made seven 3-pointers and tallied 23 points while Tyler Ulis had 16 points and 12 assists for Phoenix.\nHarden finished with 28 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds while PJ Tucker chipped in 18 points. Green added 15 points, shooting 4 of 11 on threes.\nJoe Johnson was instrumental in pulling the Rockets back from the depths, scoring 14 points in the third quarter primarily on post ups. The Suns had opened a 21-point lead at 71-50 on the third of three consecutive 3-pointers from Daniels before Johnson led the Rockets’ comeback.\nWhat was a sluggish first quarter for the Rockets turned downright ugly in the second. Houston missed five free throws and converted only six field goals in the opening period yet trailed by only three points at the end of the quarter.\nWhen Tucker drilled a corner trey midway through the frame, the Rockets trailed 37-34 and appeared poised to fashion a rally into the lead.\nInstead, the Suns reeled off a 12-0 burst, with Jackson recording seven points during that run.\nHouston managed just two baskets down the stretch of the half while the Suns kept firing away, and after two Ulis threes and a Jackson basket through a foul, Phoenix led by 17 at the intermission.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
