    "text": "\nMandel Ngan | AFP | Getty Images President Donald Trump President Donald Trump on Tuesday said that trade wars hurt those on the other side, and not the United States. \"When we're down by $30 billion, $40 billion, $60 billion, $100 billion, the trade war hurts them, it doesn't hurt us,\" Trump said.\nThe president made the remarks at a press conference with Prime Minister Stefan Löfven of Sweden. Last week, Trump unexpectedly announced tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports.\nChristina Wilkie Political Reporter for CNBC.com ",
