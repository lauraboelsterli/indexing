    "text": "F OR NEARLY A HALF CENTURY, IBM came as close as any company to bearing the torch for the American Dream.\nAs the world's dominant technology firm, payrolls at International Business Machines Corp. swelled to nearly a quarter-million U.S. white-collar workers in the 1980s. Its profits helped underwrite a broad agenda of racial equality, equal pay for women and an unbeatable offer of great wages and something close to lifetime employment, all in return for unswerving loyalty.\nBut when high tech suddenly started shifting and companies went global, IBM faced the changing landscape with a distinction most of its fiercest competitors didn't have: a large number of experienced and aging U.S. employees.\nMore from ProPublica:\nDonald Trump Jr. Pushed 'Blatantly Illegal' Project In India, Former Official Says — 'Trump, Inc.' Podcast\nA Political Boss Goes Down\nEroding Protection Under the Law\nThe company reacted with a strategy that, in the words of one confidential planning document, would \"correct seniority mix.\" It slashed IBM's U.S. workforce by as much as three-quarters from its 1980s peak, replacing a substantial share with younger, less-experienced and lower-paid workers and sending many positions overseas. ProPublica estimates that in the past five years alone, IBM has eliminated more than 20,000 American employees ages 40 and over, about 60 percent of its estimated total U.S. job cuts during those years.\nIn making these cuts, IBM has flouted or outflanked U.S. laws and regulations intended to protect later-career workers from age discrimination, according to a ProPublica review of internal company documents, legal filings and public records, as well as information provided via interviews and questionnaires filled out by more than 1,000 former IBM employees.\nAmong ProPublica's findings, IBM:\nDenied older workers information the law says they need in order to decide whether they've been victims of age bias, and required them to sign away the right to go to court or join with others to seek redress. Targeted people for layoffs and firings with techniques that tilted against older workers, even when the company rated them high performers. In some instances, the money saved from the departures went toward hiring young replacements. Converted job cuts into retirements and took steps to boost resignations and firings. The moves reduced the number of employees counted as layoffs, where high numbers can trigger public disclosure requirements. Encouraged employees targeted for layoff to apply for other IBM positions, while quietly advising managers not to hire them and requiring many of the workers to train their replacements. Told some older employees being laid off that their skills were out of date, but then brought them back as contract workers, often for the same work at lower pay and fewer benefits. IBM declined requests for the numbers or age breakdown of its job cuts. ProPublica provided the company with a 10-page summary of its findings and the evidence on which they were based. IBM spokesman Edward Barbini said that to respond the company needed to see copies of all documents cited in the story, a request ProPublica could not fulfill without breaking faith with its sources. Instead, ProPublica provided IBM with detailed descriptions of the paperwork. Barbini declined to address the documents or answer specific questions about the firm's policies and practices, and instead issued the following statement:\n\"We are proud of our company and our employees' ability to reinvent themselves era after era, while always complying with the law. Our ability to do this is why we are the only tech company that has not only survived but thrived for more than 100 years.\"\nWith nearly 400,000 people worldwide, and tens of thousands still in the U.S., IBM remains a corporate giant. How it handles the shift from its veteran baby-boom workforce to younger generations will likely influence what other employers do. And the way it treats its experienced workers will eventually affect younger IBM employees as they too age.\nFifty years ago, Congress made it illegal with the Age Discrimination in Employment Act , or ADEA, to treat older workers differently than younger ones with only a few exceptions, such as jobs that require special physical qualifications. And for years, judges and policymakers treated the law as essentially on a par with prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation and other categories.\nIn recent decades, however, the courts have responded to corporate pleas for greater leeway to meet global competition and satisfy investor demands for rising profits by expanding the exceptions and shrinking the protections against age bias .\n\"Age discrimination is an open secret like sexual harassment was until recently,\" said Victoria Lipnic, the acting chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or EEOC, the independent federal agency that administers the nation's workplace anti-discrimination laws.\n\"Everybody knows it's happening, but often these cases are difficult to prove\" because courts have weakened the law, Lipnic said. \"The fact remains it's an unfair and illegal way to treat people that can be economically devastating.\"\nMany companies have sought to take advantage of the court rulings. But the story of IBM's downsizing provides an unusually detailed portrait of how a major American corporation systematically identified employees to coax or force out of work in their 40s, 50s and 60s, a time when many are still productive and need a paycheck, but face huge hurdles finding anything like comparable jobs.\nThe dislocation caused by IBM's cuts has been especially great because until recently the company encouraged its employees to think of themselves as \"IBMers\" and many operated under the assumption that they had career-long employment.\nWhen the ax suddenly fell, IBM provided almost no information about why an employee was cut or who else was departing, leaving people to piece together what had happened through websites, listservs and Facebook groups such as \"Watching IBM\" or \"Geographically Undesirable IBM Marketers,\" as well as informal support groups.\nMarjorie Madfis, at the time 57, was a New York-based digital marketing strategist and 17-year IBM employee when she and six other members of her nine-person team — all women in their 40s and 50s — were laid off in July 2013. The two who remained were younger men.\nSince her specialty was one that IBM had said it was expanding, she asked for a written explanation of why she was let go. The company declined to provide it.\nDemetrius Freeman for ProPublica Marjorie Madfis was among seven women in their 40s and 50s laid off from their IBM marketing team in White Plains, New York, in 2013. The two members who remained were younger men. “The only explanation is our age,” says Madfis. \"They got rid of a group of highly skilled, highly effective, highly respected women, including me, for a reason nobody knows,\" Madfis said in an interview. \"The only explanation is our age.\"\nBrian Paulson, also 57, a senior manager with 18 years at IBM, had been on the road for more than a year overseeing hundreds of workers across two continents as well as hitting his sales targets for new services, when he got a phone call in October 2015 telling him he was out. He said the caller, an executive who was not among his immediate managers, cited \"performance\" as the reason, but refused to explain what specific aspects of his work might have fallen short.\nIt took Paulson two years to land another job, even though he was equipped with an advanced degree, continuously employed at high-level technical jobs for more than three decades and ready to move anywhere from his Fairview, Texas, home.\n\"It's tough when you've worked your whole life,\" he said. \"The company doesn't tell you anything. And once you get to a certain age, you don't hear a word from the places you apply.\"\nPaul Henry, a 61-year-old IBM sales and technical specialist who loved being on the road, had just returned to his Columbus home from a business trip in August 2016 when he learned he'd been let go. When he asked why, he said an executive told him to \"keep your mouth shut and go quietly.\"\nHenry was jobless more than a year, ran through much of his savings to cover the mortgage and health insurance and applied for more than 150 jobs before he found a temporary slot.\n\"If you're over 55, forget about preparing for retirement,\" he said in an interview. \"You have to prepare for losing your job and burning through every cent you've saved just to get to retirement.\"\nIBM's latest actions aren't anything like what most ex-employees with whom ProPublica talked expected from their years of service, or what today's young workers think awaits them — or are prepared to deal with — later in their careers.\n\"In a fast-moving economy, employers are always going to be tempted to replace older workers with younger ones, more expensive workers with cheaper ones, those who've performed steadily with ones who seem to be up on the latest thing,\" said Joseph Seiner, an employment law professor at the University of South Carolina and former appellate attorney for the EEOC.\n\"But it's not good for society,\" he added. \"We have rules to try to maintain some fairness in our lives, our age-discrimination laws among them. You can't just disregard them.\"\n'Old Heads' Needn't Apply FOR MUCH OF ITS HISTORY, IBM viewed its fate and that of its predominantly U.S. workforce as inseparable. By the late 1960s, the company's grip on the mainframe computer business had grown so great the Justice Department sued it for monopolizing the industry, a case that dragged on for years before being dropped as \"without merit.\" Such dominance convinced executives they could deliver extraordinary workplace stability in return for loyal service.\n\"When recessions occur or there is a major product shift, some companies handle the resulting workforce imbalances by letting people go,\" explained an employee handbook of the 1980s. By contrast, IBM \"retrains, reassigns and even relocates employees.\"\nFor their part, continued the handbook, employees must be \"flexible, willing to change, work overtime, and adapt to new situations quickly.\" The logic behind the bargain was that \"people are a treasured resource.\" At IBM, \"they are treated like one.\"\nBut within a decade, IBM had stumbled not once but three times, in ways that would come to cost both the company and its workers. First, it failed to appreciate the \"major product shift\" behind a new chip technology that first entered people's lives as the guts of pocket calculators and cheap digital watches and was making possible increasingly powerful and networked personal computers that undercut the company's mainframe business. Second, it misjudged its employees' reaction to switching to a kind of pension that no longer rewarded older, long-service workers. IBM workers responded with a lawsuit that forced the company to settle by paying more than $300 million and reinstating expensive traditional pensions for more than 100,000 of them.\nAnd by the early years of the new century, IBM was falling behind again by failing to quickly devise innovative uses for the internet like its new rivals, Google, Facebook and Amazon. As it slipped, the company began having second thoughts about the price of unbending loyalty to its long-serving workforce.\nIn a little-noticed paper issued in 2006 by the London office of one of the company's consulting arms, executives praised boomers' experience, but described them as \"gray hairs\" and \"old heads.\" While recognizing that older workers were important to high-tech employers such as IBM, it concluded that \"successor generations … are generally much more innovative and receptive to technology than baby boomers.\"\nThe paper was subsequently cited in an age discrimination lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Pennsylvania. Before the complaint was settled last year, the plaintiffs alleged in a filing: \"IBM's Boomer employees — being labeled by IBM's own research as uncollaborative, skeptical of leadership, technologically unsophisticated, less innovative and generally out of touch with IBM's brand, customers and objectives — were shown the door in droves.\"\nBy the time IBM's current CEO, Virginia \"Ginni\" Rometty, took over in 2012, the company had shifted its personnel focus to millennials.\nRometty launched a major overhaul that aimed to make IBM a major player in the emerging technologies of cloud services, big data analytics, mobile, security and social media, or what came to be known inside as CAMS.\nAt the same time, she sought to sharply increase hiring of people born after 1980.\n\"CAMS are driven by Millennial Traits,\" declared a slide presentation for an invitation-only IBM event in New York in December 2014. Not only were millennials in sync with the new technologies, but they were also attuned to the collaborative, consensus-driven modes of work these technologies demanded, company researchers said they'd discovered. Millennials \"are not likely to make decisions in isolation,\" the presentation said, but instead \"depend on analytic technologies to help them.\"\nBy contrast, people 50 or over are \"more dubious\" of analytics, \"place less stock in the advantages data offers,\" and are less \"motivated to consult their colleagues or get their buy in … It's Baby Boomers who are the outliers.\"\nThe message was clear. To succeed at the new technologies, the company must, in the words of the presentation, \"become one with the Millennial mindset.\" Similar language found its way into a variety of IBM presentations in subsequent years .\nEven before the New York conference, IBM had begun a major effort to recruit millennial employees. It launched a blog, \" The Millennial Experience ,\" and a hashtag on Twitter, #IBMillennial.\" It began an online and print advertising campaign primarily featuring young people. It established a \"Millennial Corps,\" a network of more than 5,000 young IBMers whom Rometty and other top executives said they'd regularly consult before making business decisions. And it sharply improved benefits, like parental leave, especially important to younger employees.\nIts initiatives won IBM plaudits from women's groups; lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender organizations; human rights and disability associations; indeed advocates for just about every class of people protected under U.S. equal employment opportunity laws.\nAnd the entire effort was guided by something that then-IBM brand strategist Bill Grady told the 2014 conference: \"What's good for Millennials is good for everyone.\"\nExit Strategy AS IBM TRAINED ITS SIGHTS on younger workers, it also took steps to change the way it dealt with those who'd spent many years on the job. It embraced a legal strategy that made it much easier for the company to dismiss older workers, and to do so in ways that minimized legal consequences and largely avoided public attention.\nUntil 2014, IBM had provided two lists to workers getting laid off. One showed the positions and ages, but not the names, of all the people laid off from their business units at the same time. The other showed the positions and ages of all those staying on. For example, Madfis, the digital marketing strategist, got a list when she was let go in July 2013.\nSuch lists are common in corporate layoffs, thanks to a disclosure requirement added to the ADEA in 1990. The reason for the new rule was that virtually all employers had begun making severance pay and other parting benefits contingent on a laid-off worker signing away the right to sue the company. Congress wanted to make sure that before employees signed such waivers they understood enough to make \"knowing and voluntary\" decisions about whether they might have been targeted because of their age.\nIBM complied with the disclosure requirement for more than two decades. As a result, even when the company stopped disclosing its U.S. employment totals — and thus its job cuts — the numbers still became known as employees collected and tallied the number of layoffs from lists provided to workers by various company units.\nONE DEPARTURE, TWO LETTERS\nJust a few months after receiving a layoff notice, the same employee received a congratulatory letter about retiring.\nSo after it ran into political flak for its workforce reductions, IBM decided to stop giving out the lists. When Diane Moos, 62, of Long Beach, California, lost her job as a systems security specialist in May 2016, she had no way of knowing how many people had been laid off with her, or their ages.\nIBM spokesman Doug Shelton said at the time the company was acting out of concern for its workers who had complained the disclosures \"infringed on employee privacy\" — even though the lists contained no names.\nHow did IBM get around the legal requirement for the disclosures? With a move that even critics acknowledge is ingenious.\nThe company's pre-2014 layoff documents required employees receiving severance to waive all bias claims based on \"race, national origin, ancestry, color, creed, religion, sex, sexual orientation, pregnancy, marital status, age … disability, medical condition, or veteran status.\" The new documents deleted \"age\" from the waiver list. In fact, they specifically said employees were not waiving their right when it came to age and could pursue age discrimination cases against the company.\nBut, the new documents added, employees had to waive the right to take their age cases to court. Instead, they had to pursue them through private arbitration. What's more, they had to keep them confidential and pursue them alone. They couldn't join with other workers to make a case.\nWith the new documents in place, IBM was no longer asking laid-off workers to sign away their right to complain about age bias so, the company's lawyers told the EEOC, the disclosure requirement in the 1990 amendments to the age act no longer applied.\nCritics say the company's argument is hard to square with the statute's clear requirements.\n\"You have a law that says older workers being laid off need this information and employers are obligated to provide it. You have a company that's not providing it,\" said David Lopez, the former general counsel for the EEOC. \"How can this not be undercutting the intent of the law?\"\nIn their relationships with both workers and customers, American corporations are making increasingly heavy use of arbitration, contending the process is fair and saves all parties time and legal costs. The Supreme Court has repeatedly expanded the right of companies to require that disputes be settled by arbitrators rather than judges.\nWhen it comes to employment claims, studies have found that arbitrators overwhelmingly favor employers. Research by Cornell University law and labor relations specialist Alexander Colvin found that workers win only 19 percent of the time when their cases are arbitrated. By contrast, they win 36 percent of the time when they go to federal court, and 57 percent in state courts. Average payouts when an employee wins follow a similar pattern.\nGiven those odds, and having signed away their rights to go to court, some laid-off IBM workers have chosen the one independent forum companies can't deny them: the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. That's where Moos, the Long Beach systems security specialist, and several of her colleagues, turned for help when they were laid off. In their complaints to the agency, they said they'd suffered age discrimination because of the company's effort to \"drastically change the IBM employee age mix … to be seen as a startup.\"\nIn its formal reply to the EEOC, IBM said that age couldn't have been a factor in their dismissals. Among the reasons it cited: The managers who decided on the layoffs were in their 40s and therefore older too.\nTilting the Table WHETHER IBM IS STAYING WITHIN U.S. age laws as it cuts from and adds to its workforce turns largely on how and why the company chooses individuals to be eliminated. While executives say they never target older workers, internal company documents and interviews suggest otherwise.\nConsider, for example, a planning presentation that former IBM executives said was drafted by heads of a business unit carved out of IBM's once-giant software group and charged with pursuing the \"C,\" or cloud, portion of the company's CAMS strategy.\nThe presentation laid out plans for substantially altering the unit's workforce. It was shown to company leaders including Diane Gherson, the senior vice president for human resources, and James Kavanaugh, recently elevated to chief financial officer. Its language was couched in the argot of \"resources,\" IBM's term for employees, and \"EP's,\" its shorthand for early professionals or recent college graduates.\nAmong the goals: \"Shift headcount mix towards greater % of Early Professional hires.\"\nAmong the means: \"[D]rive a more aggressive performance management approach to enable us to hire and replace where needed, and fund an influx of EPs to correct seniority mix.\"\nAmong the expected results: \"[A] significant reduction in our workforce of 2,500 resources.\"\nA slide from a similar presentation prepared last spring for the same leaders called for \"re-profiling current talent\" to \"create room for new talent.\" Presentations for 2015 and 2016 for the 50,000-employee software group also included plans for \"aggressive performance management\" and emphasized the need to \"maintain steady attrition to offset hiring.\"\nIBM declined to answer questions about whether either presentation was turned into company policy. The description of the planned moves matches what hundreds of older ex-employees told ProPublica they believe happened to them: They were ousted because of their age. The company used their exits to hire replacements, many of them young; to ship their work overseas; or to cut its overall headcount.\nEd Alpern, now 65, of Austin, started his 39-year run with IBM as a Selectric typewriter repairman. He ended as a project manager in October of 2016 when, he said, his manager told him he could either leave with severance and other parting benefits or be given a bad job review — something he said he'd never previously received — and risk being fired without them.\nAlbert Poggi, now 70, was a three-decade IBM veteran and ran the company's Palisades, New York, technical center where clients can test new products. When notified in November of 2016 he was losing his job to layoff, he asked his bosses why, given what he said was a history of high job ratings. \"They told me,\" he said, \"they needed to fill it with someone newer.\"\nThe presentations from the software group, as well as the stories of ex-employees like Alpern and Poggi, square with internal documents from two other major IBM business units. The documents for all three cover some or all of the years from 2013 through the beginning of 2018 and deal with job assessments, hiring, firing and layoffs.\nThe documents detail practices that appear at odds with how IBM says it treats its employees. In many instances, the practices in effect, if not intent, tilt against the company's older U.S. workers.\nFor example, IBM spokespeople and lawyers have said the company never considers a worker's age in making decisions about layoffs or firings.\nBut one 2014 document reviewed by ProPublica includes dates of birth. An ex-IBM employee familiar with the process said executives from one business unit used it to decide about layoffs or other job changes for nearly a thousand workers, almost two-thirds of them over 50.\nDocuments from subsequent years show that young workers are protected from cuts for at least a limited period of time. A 2016 slide presentation prepared by the company's global technology services unit, titled \"U.S. Resource Action Process\" and used to guide managers in layoff procedures, includes bullets for categories considered \"ineligible\" for layoff. Among them: \"early professional hires,\" meaning recent college graduates.\nThis slide, from an invitation-only IBM conference in New York in December 2014, suggests that the company's future success in marketing emerging technologies depended on how well it understood and embraced the generation born after 1980.\nIn responding to age-discrimination complaints that ex-employees file with the EEOC, lawyers for IBM say that front-line managers make all decisions about who gets laid off, and that their decisions are based strictly on skills and job performance, not age.\nBut ProPublica reviewed spreadsheets that indicate front-line managers hardly acted alone in making layoff calls. Former IBM managers said the spreadsheets were prepared for upper-level executives and kept continuously updated. They list hundreds of employees together with codes like \"lift and shift,\" indicating that their jobs were to be lifted from them and shifted overseas, and details such as whether IBM's clients had approved the change.\nAn examination of several of the spreadsheets suggests that, whatever the criteria for assembling them, the resulting list of those marked for layoff was skewed toward older workers. A 2016 spreadsheet listed more than 400 full-time U.S. employees under the heading \"REBAL,\" which refers to \"rebalancing,\" the process that can lead to laying off workers and either replacing them or shifting the jobs overseas. Using the job search site LinkedIn, ProPublica was able to locate about 100 of these employees and then obtain their ages through public records. Ninety percent of those found were 40 or older. Seventy percent were over 50.\nIBM frequently cites its history of encouraging diversity in its responses to EEOC complaints about age discrimination. \"IBM has been a leader in taking positive actions to ensure its business opportunities are made available to individuals without regard to age, race, color, gender, sexual orientation and other categories,\" a lawyer for the company wrote in a May 2017 letter. \"This policy of non-discrimination is reflected in all IBM business activities.\"\nBut ProPublica found at least one company business unit using a point system that disadvantaged older workers. The system awarded points for attributes valued by the company. The more points a person garnered, according to the former employee, the more protected she or he was from layoff or other negative job change; the fewer points, the more vulnerable.\nThe arrangement appears on its face to favor younger newcomers over older veterans. Employees were awarded points for being relatively new at a job level or in a particular role. Those who worked for IBM for fewer years got more points than those who'd been there a long time.\nThe ex-employee familiar with the process said a 2014 spreadsheet from that business unit, labeled \"IBM Confidential,\" was assembled to assess the job prospects of more than 600 high-level employees, two-thirds of them from the U.S. It included employees' years of service with IBM, which the former employee said was used internally as a proxy for age. Also listed was an assessment by their bosses of their career trajectories as measured by the highest job level they were likely to attain if they remained at the company, as well as their point scores.\nThe tilt against older workers is evident when employees' years of service are compared with their point scores. Those with no points and therefore most vulnerable to layoff had worked at IBM an average of more than 30 years; those with a high number of points averaged half that.\nPerhaps even more striking is the comparison between employees' service years and point scores on the one hand and their superiors' assessments of their career trajectories on the other.\nAlong with many American employers, IBM has argued it needs to shed older workers because they're no longer at the top of their games or lack \"contemporary\" skills.\nBut among those sized up in the confidential spreadsheet, fully 80 percent of older employees — those with the most years of service but no points and therefore most vulnerable to layoff — were rated by superiors as good enough to stay at their current job levels or be promoted. By contrast, only a small percentage of younger employees with a high number of points were similarly rated.\n\"No major company would use tools to conduct a layoff where a disproportionate share of those let go were African Americans or women,\" said Cathy Ventrell-Monsees, senior attorney adviser with the EEOC and former director of age litigation for the senior lobbying giant AARP. \"There's no difference if the tools result in a disproportionate share being older workers.\"\nIn addition to the point system that disadvantaged older workers in layoffs, other documents suggest that IBM has made increasingly aggressive use of its job-rating machinery to pave the way for straight-out firings, or what the company calls \"management-initiated separations.\" Internal documents suggest that older workers were especially targets.\nLike in many companies, IBM employees sit down with their managers at the start of each year and set goals for themselves. IBM graded on a scale of 1 to 4, with 1 being top-ranked.\nThose rated as 3 or 4 were given formal short-term goals known as personal improvement plans, or PIPs. Historically many managers were lenient, especially toward those with 3s whose ratings had dropped because of forces beyond their control, such as a weakness in the overall economy, ex-employees said.\nBut within the past couple of years, IBM appears to have decided the time for leniency was over. For example, a software group planning document for 2015 said that, over and above layoffs, the unit should seek to fire about 3,000 of the unit's 50,000-plus workers.\nTo make such deep cuts, the document said, executives should strike an \"aggressive performance management posture.\" They needed to double the share of employees given low 3 and 4 ratings to at least 6.6 percent of the division's workforce. And because layoffs cost the company more than outright dismissals or resignations, the document said, executives should make sure that more than 80 percent of those with low ratings get fired or forced to quit.\nFinally, the 2015 document said the division should work \"to attract the best and brightest early professionals\" to replace up to two-thirds of those sent packing. A more recent planning document — the presentation to top executives Gherson and Kavanaugh for a business unit carved out of the software group — recommended using similar techniques to free up money by cutting current employees to fund an \"influx\" of young workers.\nIn a recent interview, Poggi said he was resigned to being laid off. \"Everybody at IBM has a bullet with their name on it,\" he said. Alpern wasn't nearly as accepting of being threatened with a poor job rating and then fired.\nAlpern had a particular reason for wanting to stay on at IBM, at least until the end of last year. His younger son, Justin, then a high school senior, had been named a National Merit semifinalist. Alpern wanted him to be able to apply for one of the company's Watson scholarships. But IBM had recently narrowed eligibility so only the children of current employees could apply, not also retirees as it was until 2014.\nAlpern had to make it through December for his son to be eligible.\nBut in August, he said, his manager ordered him to retire. He sought to buy time by appealing to superiors. But he said the manager's response was to threaten him with a bad job review that, he was told, would land him on a PIP, where his work would be scrutinized weekly. If he failed to hit his targets — and his managers would be the judges of that — he'd be fired and lose his benefits.\nAlpern couldn't risk it; he retired on Oct. 31. His son, now a freshman on the dean's list at Texas A&M University, didn't get to apply.\n\"I can think of only a couple regrets or disappointments over my 39 years at IBM,\"\" he said, \"and that's one of them.\"\n'Congratulations on Your Retirement!' LIKE ANY COMPANY IN THE U.S. , IBM faces few legal constraints to reducing the size of its workforce. And with its no-disclosure strategy, it eliminated one of the last regular sources of information about its employment practices and the changing size of its American workforce.\nBut there remained the question of whether recent cutbacks were big enough to trigger state and federal requirements for disclosure of layoffs. And internal documents, such as a slide in a 2016 presentation titled \"Transforming to Next Generation Digital Talent,\" suggest executives worried that \"winning the talent war\" for new young workers required IBM to improve the \"attractiveness of (its) culture and work environment,\" a tall order in the face of layoffs and firings.\nSo the company apparently has sought to put a softer face on its cutbacks by recasting many as voluntary rather than the result of decisions by the firm. One way it has done this is by converting many layoffs to retirements.\nSome ex-employees told ProPublica that, faced with a layoff notice, they were just as happy to retire. Others said they felt forced to accept a retirement package and leave. Several actively objected to the company treating their ouster as a retirement. The company nevertheless processed their exits as such.\nProject manager Ed Alpern's departure was treated in company paperwork as a voluntary retirement. He didn't see it that way, because the alternative he said he was offered was being fired outright.\nLorilynn King, a 55-year-old IT specialist who worked from her home in Loveland, Colorado, had been with IBM almost as long as Alpern by May 2016 when her manager called to tell her the company was conducting a layoff and her name was on the list.\nKing said the manager told her to report to a meeting in Building 1 on IBM's Boulder campus the following day. There, she said, she found herself in a group of other older employees being told by an IBM human resources representative that they'd all be retiring. \"I have NO intention of retiring,\" she remembers responding. \"I'm being laid off.\"\nProPublica has collected documents from 15 ex-IBM employees who got layoff notices followed by a retirement package and has talked with many others who said they received similar paperwork. Critics say the sequence doesn't square well with the law.\n\"This country has banned mandatory retirement,\" said Seiner, the University of South Carolina law professor and former EEOC appellate lawyer. \"The law says taking a retirement package has to be voluntary. If you tell somebody 'Retire or we'll lay you off or fire you,' that's not voluntary.\"\nUntil recently, the company's retirement paperwork included a letter from Rometty, the CEO, that read, in part, \"I wanted to take this opportunity to wish you well on your retirement … While you may be retiring to embark on the next phase of your personal journey, you will always remain a valued and appreciated member of the IBM family.\" Ex-employees said IBM stopped sending the letter last year.\nIBM has also embraced another practice that leads workers, especially older ones, to quit on what appears to be a voluntary basis. It substantially reversed its pioneering support for telecommuting, telling people who've been working from home for years to begin reporting to certain, often distant, offices. Their other choice: Resign.\nDavid Harlan had worked as an IBM marketing strategist from his home in Moscow, Idaho, for 15 years when a manager told him last year of orders to reduce the performance ratings of everybody at his pay grade. Then in February last year, when he was 50, came an internal video from IBM's new senior vice president, Michelle Peluso, which announced plans to improve the work of marketing employees by ordering them to work \"shoulder to shoulder.\" Those who wanted to stay on would need to \"co-locate\" to offices in one of six cities.\nEarly last year, Harlan received an email congratulating him on \"the opportunity to join your team in Raleigh, North Carolina.\" He had 30 days to decide on the 2,600-mile move. He resigned in June.\nRajah Bose for ProPublica David Harlan worked for IBM for 15 years from his home in Moscow, Idaho, where he also runs a drama company.

After the Peluso video was leaked to the press, an IBM spokeswoman told the Wall Street Journal that the \" vast majority \" of people ordered to change locations and begin reporting to offices did so. IBM Vice President Ed Barbini said in an initial email exchange with ProPublica in July that the new policy affected only about 2,000 U.S. employees and that \"most\" of those had agreed to move.\nBut employees across a wide range of company operations, from the systems and technology group to analytics, told ProPublica they've also been ordered to co-locate in recent years. Many IBMers with long service said that they quit rather than sell their homes, pull children from school and desert aging parents. IBM declined to say how many older employees were swept up in the co-location initiative.\n\"They basically knew older employees weren't going to do it,\" said Eileen Maroney, a 63-year-old IBM product manager from Aegean, South Carolina, who, like Harlan, was ordered to move to Raleigh or resign. \"Older people aren't going to move. It just doesn't make any sense.\" Like Harlan, Maroney left IBM last June.\nHaving people quit rather than being laid off may help IBM avoid disclosing how much it is shrinking its U.S. workforce and where the reductions are occurring.\nUnder the federal WARN Act , adopted in the wake of huge job cuts and factory shutdowns during the 1980s, companies laying off 50 or more employees who constitute at least one-third of an employer's workforce at a site have to give advance notice of layoffs to the workers, public agencies and local elected officials.\nSimilar laws in some states where IBM has a substantial presence are even stricter. California, for example, requires advanced notice for layoffs of 50 or more employees, no matter what the share of the workforce. New York requires notice for 25 employees who make up a third.\nBecause the laws were drafted to deal with abrupt job cuts at individual plants, they can miss reductions that occur over long periods among a workforce like IBM's that was, at least until recently, widely dispersed because of the company's work-from-home policy.\nIBM's training sessions to prepare managers for layoffs suggest the company was aware of WARN thresholds, especially in states with strict notification laws such as California. A 2016 document entitled \"Employee Separation Processing\" and labeled \"IBM Confidential\" cautions managers about the \"unique steps that must be taken when processing separations for California employees.\"\nA ProPublica review of five years of WARN disclosures for a dozen states where the company had large facilities that shed workers found no disclosures in nine. In the other three, the company alerted authorities of just under 1,000 job cuts — 380 in California, 369 in New York and 200 in Minnesota. IBM's reported figures are well below the actual number of jobs the company eliminated in these states, where in recent years it has shuttered, sold off or leveled plants that once employed vast numbers.\nBy contrast, other employers in the same 12 states reported layoffs last year alone totaling 215,000 people. They ranged from giant Walmart to Ostrom's Mushroom Farms in Washington state.\nWhether IBM operated within the rules of the WARN act, which are notoriously fungible, could not be determined because the company declined to provide ProPublica with details on its layoffs.\nA Second Act, But Poorer WITH 35 YEARS AT IBM under his belt, Ed Miyoshi had plenty of experience being pushed to take buyouts, or early retirement packages, and refusing them. But he hadn't expected to be pushed last fall.\nMiyoshi, of Hopewell Junction, New York, had some years earlier launched a pilot program to improve IBM's technical troubleshooting. With the blessing of an IBM vice president, he was busily interviewing applicants in India and Brazil to staff teams to roll the program out to clients worldwide.\nThe interviews may have been why IBM mistakenly assumed Miyoshi was a manager, and so emailed him to eliminate the one U.S.-based employee still left in his group.\n\"That was me,\" Miyoshi realized.\nIn his sign-off email to colleagues shortly before Christmas 2016, Miyoshi, then Quote: : \"I am too young and too poor to stop working yet, so while this is good-bye to my IBM career, I fully expect to cross paths with some of you very near in the future.\"\nHe did, and perhaps sooner than his colleagues had expected; he started as a subcontractor to IBM about two weeks later, on Jan. 3.\nMiyoshi is an example of older workers who've lost their regular IBM jobs and been brought back as contractors. Some of them — not Miyoshi — became contract workers after IBM told them their skills were out of date and no longer needed.\nEmployment law experts said that hiring ex-employees as contractors can be legally dicey. It raises the possibility that the layoff of the employee was not for the stated reason but perhaps because they were targeted for their age, race or gender.\nIBM appears to recognize the problem. Ex-employees say the company has repeatedly told managers — most recently earlier this year — not to contract with former employees or sign on with third-party contracting firms staffed by ex-IBMers. But ProPublica turned up dozens of instances where the company did just that.\nDemetrius Freeman for ProPublica Only two weeks after IBM laid him off in December 2016, Ed Miyoshi of Hopewell Junction, New York, started work as a subcontractor to the company. But he took a $20,000-a-year pay cut. “I’m not a millionaire, so that’s a lot of money to me,” he says. Responding to a question in a confidential questionnaire from ProPublica, one 35-year company veteran from New York said he knew exactly what happened to the job he left behind when he was laid off. \"I'M STILL DOING IT. I got a new gig eight days after departure, working for a third-party company under contract to IBM doing the exact same thing.\"\nIn many cases, of course, ex-employees are happy to have another job, even if it is connected with the company that laid them off.\nHenry, the Columbus-based sales and technical specialist who'd been with IBM's \"resiliency services\" unit, discovered that he'd lost his regular IBM job because the company had purchased an Indian firm that provided the same services. But after a year out of work, he wasn't going to turn down the offer of a temporary position as a subcontractor for IBM, relocating data centers. It got money flowing back into his household and got him back where he liked to be, on the road traveling for business.\nThe compensation most ex-IBM employees make as contractors isn't comparable. While Henry said he collected the same dollar amount, it didn't include health insurance, which cost him $1,325 a month. Miyoshi said his paycheck is 20 percent less than what he made as an IBM regular.\n\"I took an over $20,000 hit by becoming a contractor. I'm not a millionaire, so that's a lot of money to me,\" Miyoshi said.\nAnd lower pay isn't the only problem ex-IBM employees-now-subcontractors face. This year, Miyoshi's payable hours have been cut by an extra 10 \"furlough days.\" Internal documents show that IBM repeatedly furloughs subcontractors without pay, often for two, three or more weeks a quarter. In some instances, the furloughs occur with little advance notice and at financially difficult moments. In one document, for example, it appears IBM managers, trying to cope with a cost overrun spotted in mid-November, planned to dump dozens of subcontractors through the end of the year, the middle of the holiday season.\nFormer IBM employees now on contract said the company controls costs by notifying contractors in the midst of projects they have to take pay cuts or lose the work. Miyoshi said that he originally started working for his third-party contracting firm for 10 percent less than at IBM, but ended up with an additional 10 percent cut in the middle of 2017, when IBM notified the contractor it was slashing what it would pay.\nFor many ex-employees, there are few ways out. Henry, for example, sought to improve his chances of landing a new full-time job by seeking assistance to finish a college degree through a federal program designed to retrain workers hurt by offshoring of jobs.\nBut when he contacted the Ohio state agency that administers the Trade Adjustment Assistance, or TAA, program, which provides assistance to workers who lose their jobs for trade-related reasons, he was told IBM hadn't submitted necessary paperwork. State officials said Henry could apply if he could find other IBM employees who were laid off with him, information that the company doesn't provide.\nTAA is overseen by the Labor Department but is operated by states under individual agreements with Washington, so the rules can vary from state to state. But generally employers, unions, state agencies and groups of employers can petition for training help and cash assistance. Labor Department data compiled by the advocacy group Global Trade Watch shows that employers apply in about 40 percent of cases. Some groups of IBM workers have obtained retraining funds when they or their state have applied, but records dating back to the early 1990s show IBM itself has applied for and won taxpayer assistance only once, in 2008, for three Chicago-area workers whose jobs were being moved to India.\nTeasing New Jobs AS IBM ELIMINATED THOUSANDS of jobs in 2016, David Carroll, a 52-year-old Austin software engineer, thought he was safe.\nHis job was in mobile development, the \"M\" in the company's CAMS strategy. And if that didn't protect him, he figured he was only four months shy of qualifying for a program that gives employees who leave within a year of their three-decade mark access to retiree medical coverage and other benefits.\nBut the layoff notice Carroll received March 2 gave him three months — not four — to come up with another job. Having been a manager, he said he knew the gantlet he'd have to run to land a new position inside IBM.\nStill, he went at it hard, applying for more than 50 IBM jobs, including one for a job he'd successfully done only a few years earlier. For his effort, he got one offer — the week after he'd been forced to depart. He got severance pay but lost access to what would have been more generous benefits.\nEdward Kishkill, then 60, of Hillsdale, New Jersey, had made a similar calculation.\nA senior systems engineer, Kishkill recognized the danger of layoffs, but assumed he was immune because he was working in systems security, the \"S\" in CAMS and another hot area at the company.\nThe precaution did him no more good than it had Carroll. Kishkill received a layoff notice the same day, along with 17 of the 22 people on his systems security team, including Diane Moos. The notice said that Kishkill could look for other jobs internally. But if he hadn't landed anything by the end of May, he was out.\nWith a daughter who was a senior in high school headed to Boston University, he scrambled to apply, but came up dry. His last day was May 31, 2016.\nFor many, the fruitless search for jobs within IBM is the last straw, a final break with the values the company still says it embraces. Combined with the company's increasingly frequent request that departing employees train their overseas replacements, it has left many people bitter. Scores of ex-employees interviewed by ProPublica said that managers with job openings told them they weren't allowed to hire from layoff lists without getting prior, high-level clearance, something that's almost never given.\nProPublica reviewed documents that show that a substantial share of recent IBM layoffs have involved what the company calls \"lift and shift,\" lifting the work of specific U.S. employees and shifting it to specific workers in countries such as India and Brazil. For example, a document summarizing U.S. employment in part of the company's global technology services division for 2015 lists nearly a thousand people as layoff candidates, with the jobs of almost half coded for lift and shift.\nEx-employees interviewed by ProPublica said the lift-and-shift process required their extensive involvement. For example, shortly after being notified she'd be laid off, Kishkill's colleague, Moos, was told to help prepare a \"knowledge transfer\" document and begin a round of conference calls and email exchanges with two Indian IBM employees who'd be taking over her work. Moos said the interactions consumed much of her last three months at IBM.\nNext Chapters WHILE IBM HAS MANAGED to keep the scale and nature of its recent U.S. employment cuts largely under the public's radar, the company drew some unwanted attention during the 2016 presidential campaign, when then-candidate Donald Trump lambasted it for eliminating 500 jobs in Minnesota, where the company has had a presence for a half century, and shifting the work abroad.\nThe company also has caught flak — in places like Buffalo, New York ; Dubuque, Iowa ; Columbia, Missouri , and Baton Rouge, Louisiana — for promising jobs in return for state and local incentives, then failing to deliver. In all, according to public officials in those and other places, IBM promised to bring on 3,400 workers in exchange for as much as $250 million in taxpayer financing but has hired only about half as many.\nAfter Trump's victory, Rometty, in a move at least partly aimed at courting the president-elect, pledged to hire 25,000 new U.S. employees by 2020. Spokesmen said the hiring would increase IBM's U.S. employment total, although, given its continuing job cuts, the addition is unlikely to approach the promised hiring total.\nWhen The New York Times ran a story last fall saying IBM now has more employees in India than the U.S., Barbini, the corporate spokesman, rushed to declare, \"The U.S. has always been and remains IBM's center of gravity.\" But his stream of accompanying tweets and graphics focused as much on the company's record for racking up patents as hiring people.\nIBM has long been aware of the damage its job cuts can do to people. In a series of internal training documents to prepare managers for layoffs in recent years, the company has included this warning: \"Loss of a job … often triggers a grief reaction similar to what occurs after a death.\"\nMost, though not all, of the ex-IBM employees with whom ProPublica spoke have weathered the loss and re-invented themselves.\nMarjorie Madfis, the digital marketing strategist, couldn't land another tech job after her 2013 layoff, so she headed in a different direction. She started a nonprofit called Yes She Can Inc. that provides job skills development for young autistic women, including her 21-year-old daughter.\nAfter almost two years of looking and desperate for useful work, Brian Paulson, the widely traveled IBM senior manager, applied for and landed a position as a part-time rural letter carrier in Plano, Texas. He now works as a contract project manager for a Las Vegas gaming and lottery firm.\nEd Alpern, who started at IBM as a Selectric typewriter repairman, watched his son go on to become a National Merit Scholar at Texas A&M University, but not a Watson scholarship recipient.\nLori King, the IT specialist and 33-year IBM veteran who's now 56, got in a parting shot. She added an addendum to the retirement papers the firm gave her that read in part: \"It was never my plan to retire earlier than at least age 60 and I am not committing to retire. I have been informed that I am impacted by a resource action effective on 2016-08-22, which is my last day at IBM, but I am NOT retiring.\"\nKing has aced more than a year of government-funded coding boot camps and university computer courses, but has yet to land a new job.\nDavid Harlan still lives in Moscow, Idaho, after refusing IBM's \"invitation\" to move to North Carolina, and is artistic director of the Moscow Art Theatre (Too).\nEd Miyoshi is still a technical troubleshooter working as a subcontractor for IBM.\nEd Kishkill, the senior systems engineer, works part time at a local tech startup, but pays his bills as an associate at a suburban New Jersey Staples store.\nThis year, Paul Henry was back on the road, working as an IBM subcontractor in Detroit, about 200 miles from where he lived in Columbus. On Jan. 8, he put in a 14-hour day and said he planned to call home before turning in. He died in his sleep.",
