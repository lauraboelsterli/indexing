    "text": "Gettysburg, PA, March 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The March edition of the OPEN MINDS management newsletter explores how partnerships, mergers, acquisitions, and affiliations are shaping the complex consumer market. The issue includes a review of the key macro market developments driving the flux of mergers and acquisitions in the health and human service sector; an executive framework for merging, acquiring another organization, or being acquired; a market snapshot of the year’s most influential mergers; and insight interviews with leading executives who have made the decision to merge or acquire other organizations.\n“The strategic question for any executive team of a specialty provider organization is whether their organization has the market positioning for a sustainable future in that new role.
