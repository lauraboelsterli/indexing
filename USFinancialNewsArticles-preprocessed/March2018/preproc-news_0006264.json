FILE PHOTO: The logo of LafargeHolcim, the world's largest cement maker, is seen at its headquarters in Zurich, Switzerland March 2, 2017. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo The new five-year strategy targets annual sales growth of 3 to 5 percent, recurring EBITDA growth of at least 5 percent, improvement in free cash flow to over 40 percent of EBITDA, and boosting the return on invested capital to more than 8 percent. The Swiss group took a 3.8 billion Swiss franc (2.9 billion pounds) impairment charge during its fourth quarter as CEO Jan Jenisch cleared the decks for his overhaul. The company’s share price has slumped around 20 percent since a“merger of equals” between France’s Lafarge and Switzerland’s Holcim in 2015. The charge pushed LafargeHolcim into a net loss of 3.12 billion Swiss francs. Without the charge, net profit fell 31 percent to 270 million francs. Analysts polled by Reuters poll had expected net profit of 604 million francs. Revenue rose 2.7 percent to 6.7 billion francs, beating estimates of 6.47 billion francs. It unveiled a programme to cut costs by 400 million francs a year by the first quarter of 2019, including by closing corporate offices in Singapore and Miami.
