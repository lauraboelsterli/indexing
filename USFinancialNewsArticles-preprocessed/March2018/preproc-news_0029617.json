The new logo of Italy's biggest utility Enel is seen at the Rome's headquarter, Italy, March 24, 2016. REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini “(We)see none at the present,” the spokeswoman said. The comments come after Germany’s RWE RWED.DE and rival E.ON EONGN.DE announced plans to carve up networks, renewables and retail energy firm Innogy. Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore said on Thursday Enel might be interested in buying assets the two German utilities might be called on to sell by the competition authority in the wake of the deal.
