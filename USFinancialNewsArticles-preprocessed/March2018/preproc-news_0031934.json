Its creator, Portuguese chocolatier Daniel Gomes, said the diamond-shaped chocolate was certified as the world’s most expensive by the Guinness Book of Records, which in 2017 listed $250 La Madeline au Truffe made by Danish artisan chocolate-maker Fritz Knipschildt’s as the record holder. Its crown-shaped box is decorated with 5,500 Swarovksi crystals and also carries personalised pincers. ($1 = 0.8144 euros)",
