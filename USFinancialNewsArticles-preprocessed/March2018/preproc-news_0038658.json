    "text": "SOUTH JORDAN, Utah, Lucid Software , the company driving innovation and collaboration through visual communication, today formally announced two new hires to its executive team: Kat Judd as vice president of people operations and Owen Fuller as general manager of Lucidpress. These two key hires will help guide the company as Lucid brings the power of visual communication to over 15 million users in over 180 countries worldwide.\nA key element of Lucid's success has always been its significant investment in people. To support the continual growth in both customer base and employee headcount, Kat Judd will lead the company's ongoing efforts to empower employees with the best resources and to foster a culture based on the company's core values, including teamwork over ego, passion, innovation, and ownership. Her first steps toward achieving that goal have been revamping the onboarding process and launching Lucid U, an employee development program to support employees' personal career growth and development. Judd brings 10 years of experience as an employment law attorney focused on preventative advice and counsel, workplace issues, and employment law training. She previously served as a director and shareholder at Clyde Snow & Sessions in Salt Lake City.\n\"We've grown very quickly in our nearly eight years of doing business,\" said Karl Sun, co-founder and CEO at Lucid. \"We know that our people are our greatest asset, and we want to ensure that remains the case as we continue to grow. Kat Judd is the right person to lead that charge and institute a people operations approach that reflects Lucid's values and shows our commitment to the people who make up our operation.\"\nLucid has also seen success through the company's focus on developing two world-class platforms, Lucidchart and Lucidpress. As the new general manager of Lucidpress, Lucid's design and brand management software with over 4 million users, Owen Fuller is poised to bring the product to new verticals and industries. Fuller has a wealth of leadership experience at Utah-based startups, including founding Fit Marketing and serving as president of Qzzr. Fuller will oversee the continued growth of Lucidpress as the must-have solution for businesses to keep all of their assets and marketing collateral on brand and on point.\n\"Lucidpress is ready to emerge as a major force in the branding and design space, and Owen Fuller is the ideal person to spearhead that endeavor,\" said Sun. \"He has the customer centricity necessary to grow a product, and the creative mind to explore how Lucidpress might emerge as a go-to resource for entire industries like real estate. We're excited to bring him on to help take Lucidpress to the next level.\"\nLucid\nLucid is the parent company of two cloud-based visual productivity solutions: Lucidchart and Lucidpress. Lucidchart is an essential visual productivity platform that helps anyone understand and share ideas, information, and processes with clarity. Lucidpress is an intuitive design and brand management platform for creating on-brand content faster. Together, they are utilized in over 180 countries by more than 15 million users, including Amazon, Delta, Visa, Toyota, and Procter & Gamble, and 96 percent of the Fortune 500 use Lucidchart. Lucid's partners include industry leaders such as Google, Atlassian, Amazon Web Services, Salesforce, and Microsoft. Since the Utah-based company's founding in 2010, it has received numerous awards for its business and workplace culture.
