    "text": "- Declares dividend of $0.422 per Class A common share for first quarter 2018 -\nSAN FRANCISCO, March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Pattern Energy Group Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"Pattern Energy\") (NASDAQ and TSX: PEGI) today announced its financial results for the 2017 fourth quarter and year.\nHighlights\n(Comparisons made between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 results, unless otherwise noted)\nProportional gigawatt hours (\"GWh\") sold of 7,787 GWh, up 14% Net cash provided by operating activities of $218 million, up 33% Cash available for distribution (\"CAFD\") of $145.8 million, up 10% Net loss of $82.4 million Adjusted EBITDA of $343.7 million, up 13% Revenue of $411.3 million, up 16% Declared a first quarter dividend of $0.422 per Class A common share or $1.688 on an annualized basis, subsequent to the end of the period, unchanged from the previous quarter's dividend Agreed to acquire 206 MW of owned capacity in five Japanese projects which represents the Company's entry into one of the most robust renewables markets in the world, subsequent to the end of the period Returned the Santa Isabel project in Puerto Rico to operation at a limited capacity, after reconnection to the grid by the Puerto Rico Electric Authority (\"PREPA\"), in February 2018 Raised $58.6 million in capital through asset rotation with the completion of the sale of a 49% interest of the Class B membership interest in the 182 MW Panhandle 2 project to Public Sector Pension Investment Board (\"PSP Investments\") Invested $27 million in Pattern Energy Group 2 LP's (\"Pattern Development 2.0\") announced acquisition of the majority interest in Green Power Investments (\"GPI\") and the Japanese development pipeline from Pattern Energy Group LP (\"Pattern Development 1.0\"), subsequent to the end of the period Completed an equity offering of approximately $215 million in gross proceeds\n\"We met our targeted CAFD range for the year, however the result was not as strong as we had anticipated primarily due to unexpected curtailments from one-time transmission repairs in Texas and Arizona, as well as weaker than expected wind resources at the very end of the year. We increased our portfolio to nearly three gigawatts, with the additions of Broadview, Meikle and the Japanese portfolio since the beginning of 2017,\" said Mike Garland, President and CEO of Pattern Energy. \"We paid for these acquisitions from available liquidity. Our investment in the development business strengthened the platform and improved alignment across the business providing greater flexibility. We continue to have many opportunities for growth; however, we intend to be disciplined in our approach toward new capital given the recent volatility in the capital markets and we intend to pursue alternatives for owning and managing quality projects. The capital we captured from the sale of a minority interest in the Panhandle 2 project in December is just one example of the alternatives we can consider to fund future growth.\"\nFinancial Results\nPattern Energy sold 2,123,628 MWh of electricity on a proportional basis in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 1,817,651 MWh sold for the same period in 2016. Pattern Energy sold 7,787,411 MWh of electricity on a proportional basis for the year ended December 31, 2017 (the \"full year 2017\"), compared to 6,806,272 MWh sold in 2016. The increase for the quarterly period was primarily due to the commencement of commercial operations of the Broadview projects in April 2017 and the acquisition of Meikle in the third quarter of 2017. Production for the quarter was 9% below the long-term average forecast for the quarter. The increase in the annual period was primarily attributable to a 748,277 MWh increase in volume from controlling interest in consolidated MWh due to the acquisitions of the Broadview and Meikle projects and a 232,862 MWh increase in volume from unconsolidated investments due to the acquisition of Armow in October 2016.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $58.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $56.3 million for the same period in 2016, an increase of $2.0 million or 3.5%. The increase was primarily due to increased revenues of $26.1 million (excluding the unrealized loss on energy derivative and amortization of PPAs) primarily related to projects which were acquired in 2017. These increases in operating cash flow were partially offset by an increase of $9.5 million in transmission and project expense, an increase of $5.3 million in interest payments, a decrease of $3.8 million in distributions from unconsolidated investments and other changes to working capital as a result of the timing of receipts of payments and disbursements.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $217.6 million for the full year 2017 compared to $163.7 million for 2016, an increase of $53.9 million, or 33.0%. The increase was primarily due to higher revenues of $49.0 million (excluding the unrealized loss on energy derivative and amortization of PPAs) primarily from projects which were acquired in 2017, and an increase of $38.9 million in distributions from unconsolidated investments. These increases were partially offset by an increase of $21.2 million in transmission and project expense, an increase of $16.3 million in interest payments, an increase of $7.0 million in operating expenses and other changes to working capital as a result of the timing of receipts of payments and disbursements.\nCash available for distribution was $41.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $36.2 million for the same period in 2016. The $5.7 million increase in cash available for distribution was due to increases of $26.1 million in revenues (excluding the unrealized loss on energy derivative and amortization of PPAs) primarily from projects which were acquired during 2017 and $7.2 million in available cash previously restricted to fund project costs. These increases were partially offset by increased interest expense of $11.4 million (excluding amortization of financing costs and debt discount/premium) primarily due to the issuance of the unsecured notes in January 2017 and debt associated with acquisitions, increased transmission costs of $7.1 million, decreased network upgrade reimbursements of $4.5 million and decreased distributions from unconsolidated investments of $3.3 million, as well as, $2.1 million in increased principal payments on project-level debt, as compared to amounts from the same period in the prior year.\nCash available for distribution was $145.8 million for the full year 2017 compared to $133.0 million for 2016. Based on dividends paid during 2017, Pattern Energy's dividend payout ratio was 100% of 2017 cash available for distribution. The $12.8 million increase in cash available for distribution was due to additional revenues of $49.0 million (excluding the unrealized loss on energy derivative and amortization of PPAs) primarily from projects which were acquired or commenced commercial operations during 2017. In addition, we received $10.6 million in additional cash distributions from our unconsolidated investments, an incremental $6.6 million in available cash previously restricted to fund project costs and an additional $4.5 million in network upgrade reimbursements primarily related to the Broadview projects as compared to amounts received during the same period in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by increased interest expense of $23.0 million primarily due to the issuance of the unsecured notes in January 2017 and debt associated with our acquisitions, increased transmission costs and project expense totaling $21.2 million, increased operating expenses of $7.0 million, increased principal payments on project-level debt of $3.6 million and increased distributions to noncontrolling interests of $2.4 million. Reconciliations of cash available for distribution to net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP for both the quarterly and annual periods are shown below.\nNet loss was $21.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to net income of $3.4 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in net loss for the quarterly period was primarily due to a $34.3 million increase in other expense primarily related to increases in interest expense, early extinguishment of debt, losses on derivatives due to unfavorable impacts from foreign currency exchange rates and the termination of interest rate swaps and a $19.8 million increase in cost of revenues primarily related to 2017 acquisitions. The increase in net loss was partially offset by increased revenues of $29.7 million primarily related to 2017 acquisitions.\nNet loss was $82.4 million for the full year 2017 compared to $52.3 million for 2016. The increase in net loss for the annual period was primarily due to a $45.3 million increase in cost of revenues primarily due to 2017 acquisitions, a $32.0 million increase in other expense primarily related to increases in interest expense, early extinguishment of debt, losses on derivatives due to unfavorable impacts from foreign currency exchange rates and the termination of interest rate swaps, a $7.0 million increase in operating expense and a $3.1 million increase in the tax provision. The increase in net loss was partially offset by increased revenues of $57.3 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $98.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $85.1 million for the same period in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2017 was $343.7 million compared to $304.2 million for 2016. The $13.8 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA for the quarterly period was primarily attributable to an increase of $26.1 million in revenues (excluding unrealized loss on energy derivative and amortization of PPAs) primarily from projects acquired during 2017, partially offset by an increase of $9.5 million in transmission cost and project expense, as well as a $2.3 million decrease in the proportionate share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated investments. The $39.5 million increase in the annual period was primarily due to a $49.0 million increase in revenue (excluding unrealized loss on the energy derivative and amortization of PPAs) attributable to projects which were acquired or commenced commercial operations in 2017 and a $20.9 million increase in our proportionate share of Adjusted EBITDA from unconsolidated investments partially offset by a $21.2 million increase in transmission and project expense, a $7.0 million increase in operating expenses and a $1.0 million increase in transaction costs. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss determined in accordance with GAAP for both the quarterly and annual periods are shown below.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nFor the full year 2018, Pattern Energy expects annual cash available for distribution * in a range of $151 million to $181 million, representing an increase of 14% at the midpoint of the range, compared to cash available for distribution in 2017.\n(*)\nThe forward looking measure of 2018 full year cash available for distribution (CAFD) is a non-GAAP measures that cannot be reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities as the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable effort primarily because of the uncertainties involved in estimating forward-looking changes in working capital balances which are added to earnings to arrive at cash provided by operations and subtracted therefrom to arrive at CAFD. A description of the adjustments to determine CAFD can be found within Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Key Metrics, of Pattern Energy's 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2017.\nQuarterly Dividend\nPattern Energy declared a dividend for the first quarter 2018, payable on April 30, 2018, to holders of record on March 30, 2018, in the amount of $0.422 per Class A common share, which represents $1.688 on an annualized basis. The amount of the first quarter 2018 dividend is unchanged from the fourth quarter 2017 dividend.\nConstruction Pipeline\nThe table below outlines the projects that Pattern Energy has agreed to acquire, which are currently in construction, the capacity owned and the projects' anticipated commencement date for commercial operation.\nMW\nProject\nLocation\nConstruction\nStart\nCommercial\nOperations (1)\nRated (2)\nOwned\nMont Sainte-Marguerite\nQuebec\n2017\n2018\n143\n73\nOhorayama\nJapan\n2016\n2018\n33\n33\nTsugaru\nJapan\n2018\n2020\n122\n122\n(1)\nRepresents year of actual or anticipated commencement of commercial operations.\n(2)\nRated capacity represents the maximum electricity generating capacity of a project in MW. As a result of wind and other conditions, a project or a turbine may not operate at its rated capacity at all times and the amount of electricity generated will be less than its rated capacity. The amount of electricity generated may vary based on a variety of factors.\nAcquisitions\nSubsequent to the end of the period, Pattern Energy agreed to acquire 206 MW of owned interest in five projects in operation or under construction located in Japan from Pattern Development 1.0 and GPI. Pattern Energy agreed to acquire two operating solar projects (Futtsu and Kanagi), one operating wind project (Otsuki) and two under construction wind projects (Ohorayama and Tsugaru), each of which possess a 20-year power purchase agreement with attractive pricing from a top tier, creditworthy off-taker.\nPattern Energy agreed to acquire the 84 MW portfolio of Futtsu, Kanagi, Otsuki and Ohorayama for a cash purchase price of $131.5 million, which represents approximately a 10.5x multiple of the five-year average CAFD * .\nPattern Energy agreed to acquire the 122 MW Tsugaru project at the start of construction, once fully financed on a non-recourse basis, for a total cash consideration of $194.0 million, which represents a 9.0x multiple of the five-year average CAFD * starting with the first full year of operations in 2021.\n(*)\nThis forward looking measure of five-year average annual purchase price multiple of cash available for distribution (CAFD) contribution from the Japan projects is a non-GAAP measure that cannot be reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities as the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure without unreasonable effort primarily because of the uncertainties involved in estimating forward-looking changes in working capital balances which are added to earnings to arrive at cash provided by operations and subtracted therefrom to arrive at CAFD. A description of the adjustments to determine CAFD can be found within Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Key Metrics, of Pattern Energy's 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2017.\nAcquisition Pipeline\nPattern Development 1.0 and Pattern Development 2.0 (together, the Pattern Development Companies) have a pipeline of development projects totaling more than 10 GW. Pattern Energy has a Right of First Offer (\"ROFO\") on the pipeline of acquisition opportunities from the Pattern Development Companies. The identified ROFO list stands at 935 MW of owned capacity and represents a portion of the pipeline of development projects of the Pattern Development Companies, which are subject to Pattern Energy's ROFO. Since its IPO, Pattern Energy has purchased, or agreed to purchase, 1,564 MW from Pattern Development 1.0 and in aggregate grown the identified ROFO list from 746 MW to more than 2 GW.\nBelow is a summary of the identified ROFO projects that Pattern Energy expects to acquire from the Pattern Development Companies in connection with Pattern Energy's project purchase rights:\nCapacity (MW)\nIdentified\nROFO Projects\nStatus\nLocation\nConstruction\nStart (1)\nCommercial\nOperations (2)\nContract\nType\nRated (3)\nPattern\nDevelopment\nCompanies\nOwned (4)\nPattern Development 1.0 Projects\nConejo Solar (5)\nOperational\nChile\n2015\n2016\nPPA\n104\n104\nBelle River\nOperational\nOntario\n2016\n2017\nPPA\n100\n43\nEl Cabo\nOperational\nNew Mexico\n2016\n2017\nPPA\n298\n125\nNorth Kent\nOperational\nOntario\n2017\n2018\nPPA\n100\n35\nHenvey Inlet\nIn construction\nOntario\n2017\n2019\nPPA\n300\n150\nPattern Development 2.0 Projects\nStillwater Big Sky\nLate stage development\nMontana\n2017\n2018\nPPA\n79\n67\nCrazy Mountain\nLate stage development\nMontana\n2017\n2019\nPPA\n80\n68\nGrady\nLate stage development\nNew Mexico\n2018\n2019\nPPA\n220\n188\nSumita\nLate stage development\nJapan\n2019\n2021\nPPA\n100\n55\nIshikari\nLate stage development\nJapan\n2019\n2022\nPPA\n100\n100\n1481\n935\n(1)\nRepresents year of actual or anticipated commencement of construction.\n(2)\nRepresents year of actual or anticipated commencement of commercial operations.\n(3)\nRated capacity represents the maximum electricity generating capacity of a project in MW. As a result of weather and other conditions, a project will not operate at its rated capacity at all times and the amount of electricity generated may be less than its rated capacity. The amount of electricity generated may vary based on a variety of factors.\n(4)\nOwned capacity represents the maximum, or rated, electricity generating capacity of the project in MW multiplied by either Pattern Development 1.0's or Pattern Development 2.0's percentage ownership interest in the distributable cash flow of the project.\n(5)\nFrom time to time, we conduct strategic reviews of our markets. We have been conducting a strategic review of the market, growth, and opportunities in Chile. In the event we believe we can utilize funds that have already been invested in Chile or funds that might otherwise be invested in Chile in a more productive manner elsewhere that could generate a higher return on investment, we may decide to exit Chile for other opportunities with greater potential. In addition, Pattern Development 1.0 is also concurrently exploring strategic alternatives for its assets in Chile.\nCash Available for Distribution and Adjusted EBITDA Non-GAAP Reconciliations\nThe following tables reconcile non-GAAP net cash provided by operating activities to cash available for distribution and net loss to Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, for the periods presented (in thousands):\nThree months ended December 31,\nFor the year ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet cash provided by operating activities (1)\n$\n58,283\n$\n56,293\n$\n217,613\n$\n163,664\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities\n(9,093)\n(11,800)\n(31,568)\n(11,000)\nNetwork upgrade reimbursement\n346\n4,821\n9,282\n4,821\nRelease of restricted cash to fund project and general and administrative costs\n7,239\n50\n7,239\n640\nOperations and maintenance capital expenditures\n(266)\n(138)\n(783)\n(1,017)\nDistributions from unconsolidated investments\n2,147\n1,632\n13,358\n41,698\nOther\n208\n(172)\n2,182\n(302)\nLess:\nDistributions to noncontrolling interests\n(6,549)\n(6,125)\n(20,250)\n(17,896)\nPrincipal payments paid from operating cash flows\n(10,367)\n(8,312)\n(51,278)\n(47,634)\nCash available for distribution\n$\n41,948\n$\n36,249\n$\n145,795\n$\n132,974\nThree months ended December 31,\nFor the year ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(21,889)\n$\n3,445\n$\n(82,410)\n$\n(52,299)\nPlus:\nInterest expense, net of interest income\n27,678\n15,692\n100,687\n76,598\nTax provision\n6,257\n4,641\n11,734\n8,679\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion\n58,863\n47,028\n215,492\n184,002\nEBITDA\n70,909\n70,806\n245,503\n216,980\nUnrealized loss on energy derivative (1)\n3,911\n7,797\n14,045\n22,767\n(Gain) loss on derivatives\n(1,900)\n(14,361)\n9,787\n3,324\nEarly extinguishment of debt\n8,643\n—\n8,643\n—\nOther\n(1,585)\n(27)\n—\n326\nAdjustments from unconsolidated investments (2)\n—\n18,914\n—\n(659)\nPlus, proportionate share from unconsolidated investments:\nInterest expense, net of interest income\n10,132\n9,325\n39,240\n32,103\nDepreciation, amortization and accretion\n8,921\n8,139\n35,311\n27,763\n(Gain) loss on derivatives\n(133)\n(15,463)\n(8,829)\n1,552\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n98,898\n$\n85,130\n$\n343,700\n$\n304,156\n(1)\nAmount is included in electricity sales on the consolidated statements of operations.\n(2)\nAdjustments from unconsolidated investments for the three months ended December 31, 2016, consists of $4.9 million gains on distributions from unconsolidated investments and $(23.8) million of suspended equity earnings.
