    "text": "March 1, 2018 / 10:12 AM / in 8 hours Perth Mint's gold, silver sales fall for first time in three months in Feb Reuters Staff 3 Min Read March 1 (Reuters) - The Perth Mint's sales of gold and silver products fell in February for the first time in three months, the mint said in a blog post on its website on Thursday. Sales of gold coins and minted bars declined 29 percent to 26,473 ounces in February from 37,174 ounces a month ago, the mint said. Silver sales in February were down 7 percent month-on-month to 992,954 ounces. Sales, however, nearly doubled in February compared with the same month last year. The Perth Mint refines more than 90 percent of the newly mined gold in Australia, the world's second-largest gold producer after China. Spot gold prices fell about 2 percent in February to post its biggest monthly decline since September last year.
