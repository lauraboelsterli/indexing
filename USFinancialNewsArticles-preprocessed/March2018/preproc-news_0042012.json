Shanghai Futures Exchange copper rose 0.8 percent. * FEDERAL RESERVE: The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and forecast two more hikes for 2018 in its first policy meeting under new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. * DOLLAR: The U.S. dollar was on the defensive on Thursday after posting its largest loss in two months when the Federal Reserve turned out to be less hawkish than anticipated. * TARIFFS: President Donald Trump will announce tariffs on Chinese imports on Thursday, a White House official said, in a move aimed at curbing theft of U.S. technology and likely to trigger retaliation from Beijing and stoke fears of a global trade war. * CHINA: China accused the United States of \"repeatedly abusing\" trade practices, as Beijing braced on Thursday for an imminent announcement from U.S. President Donald Trump slapping more tariffs on Chinese imports. * RIO TINTO: Swiss prosecutors confirmed on Wednesday they were investigating whether miner Rio Tinto paid bribes linked to the landmark Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine. * ALUMINIUM: Among other metals, LME aluminium pared more than 1 percent gains to $2,094, still up 0.6 percent, having broken back above the 200-day moving average after closing below the key technical level for two sessions in a row. * Shfe aluminium however was flirting with its weakest levels in 14 months, around 13,820 yuan, with more China production expected to come on stream in coming weeks after the expiration of the country's winter pollution controls. * Shfe lead rallied more than 3 percent, partly due to a technical breakout based on gains in sister-metal zinc, where available exchange-based inventories have dwindled. * For the top stories in metals and other news, click or PRICES BASE METALS PRICES 0723 GMT Three month LME copper 6826.5 Most active ShFE copper 51230 Three month LME aluminium 2093 Most active ShFE 13970 aluminium Three month LME zinc 3259 Most active ShFE zinc 24845 Three month LME lead 2414 Most active ShFE lead 18855 Three month LME nickel 13495 Most active ShFE nickel 101770 Three month LME tin 20980 Most active ShFE tin 144810 BASE METALS ARBITRAGE LME/SHFE COPPER LMESHFCUc3 969.69 LME/SHFE ALUMINIUM LMESHFALc3 -1384.37 LME/SHFE ZINC LMESHFZNc3 416.12 LME/SHFE LEAD LMESHFPBc3 237.54 LME/SHFE NICKEL LMESHFNIc3 728.54 ($1 = 6.3167 Chinese yuan) (Reporting by Melanie Burton; Editing by Vyas Mohan and Sunil Nair)",
