An index tracking major materials firms was also down 1.1 percent. ** The smaller Shenzhen index ended down 0.77 percent and the start-up board ChiNext Composite index was weaker by 0.69 percent. ** The largest percentage gainers on the main Shanghai Composite index were Hna Innovation Co Ltd up 10 percent, followed by Shanghai Tianchen Co Ltd gaining 9.99 percent and Tibet Tourism Co Ltd up by 9.99 percent. ** The largest percentage losers on the index were Zhejiang XinAn Chemical Industrial Group Co Ltd down 8.32 percent, followed by Shandong Lukang Pharmaceutical Co Ltd losing 6.12 percent and 360 Security Technology Inc down by 4.9 percent. ** About 16.87 billion shares were traded on the Shanghai exchange, roughly 83.3 percent of the market’s 30-day moving average of 20.24 billion shares a day. The volume in the previous trading session was 19.54 billion. ** As of 07:02 GMT, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 30.11 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares.
