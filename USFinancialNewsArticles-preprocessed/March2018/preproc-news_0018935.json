    "text": "  3:49 p.m. ET Share \nLegal team seeks to use interview with president as leverage in negotiations \nBy Peter Nicholas Reuters President Donald Trump’s lawyers are seeking to negotiate a deal with special counsel Robert Mueller. \nPresident Donald Trump’s lawyers are seeking to negotiate a deal with special counsel Robert Mueller that uses an interview with the president as leverage to spur a conclusion to the Russia investigation, according to a person familiar with the discussions. \nThe president’s legal team is considering telling Mueller that Trump would agree to a sit-down interview based on multiple considerations, including that the special counsel commit to a date for concluding at least the Trump-related portion of the investigation. One idea is to suggest a deadline of 60 days from the date of the interview, the person said. \nAnother consideration for the legal team is reaching an agreement with Mueller on the scope of his questioning of the president, which they expect to focus largely on his decision to fire former national security adviser Mike Flynn and former FBI director James Comey, according to people familiar with the matter.",
