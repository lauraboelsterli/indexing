    "text": "SAN DIEGO, March 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Senomyx , Inc. (NASDAQ: SNMX), a leading company using proprietary taste science technologies to discover, develop, and commercialize novel flavor ingredients and natural high intensity sweeteners for the food, beverage, and ingredient supply industries, has retained Needham & Company, a leading investment bank, and Conexus Capital Advisors, an independent corporate advisory firm, to explore and evaluate all available strategic options. Needham will act as the lead financial advisor with Conexus serving as an additional strategic advisor.\n\"The Senomyx Board has engaged both Needham & Company and Conexus Capital Advisors to evaluate a range of potential strategic alternatives, including the potential sale of the Company, with the goal of enhancing value for our shareholders,\" said Kent Snyder, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Senomyx. \"Given our longstanding relationship with Needham & Company, we are well aware of their expertise and are confident in their ability to skillfully serve as our lead financial advisor through this process. Additionally, following the successful conclusion of our previous strategic review process, which resulted in the monetization of certain cool taste ingredients for a sum of $10 million, we've decided to, once again, engage Conexus Capital Advisors for their sector expertise, knowledge of Senomyx and proven track record.\"\nSenomyx does not expect to disclose further developments relating to the strategic review process, unless and until its Board of Directors has approved a specific transaction, otherwise concludes the review of strategic alternatives or determines that further disclosure is appropriate. There can be no assurance the process will result in the Company pursuing a particular transaction or consummating any such transaction.\nAbout Senomyx, Inc.\nSenomyx discovers novel flavor ingredients and natural high intensity sweeteners that allow food and beverage companies to create better-for-you products. Under its direct sales program, Senomyx sells its Complimyx速 brand flavor ingredients, Sweetmyx速, Savorymyx速, and Bittermyx速, to flavor companies for use in a wide variety of foods and beverages. In addition, Senomyx has partnerships with leading global food, beverage, and ingredient supply companies, which are currently marketing products that contain Senomyx's flavor ingredients.
