    "text": "NEW YORK, March 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MetTel , a leading communications solutions provider, today announced Peter Bell as SVP of Sales for the Digital Transformation (DX) unit at the company and David Dickson as the Executive Director of its Unified Communications (UC) solutions. Both executives will work across the company's portfolio of solutions designed to transform the network and mobile communications of enterprises across all industries.\nBell has over 20 years of global sales management expertise working with enterprise companies in North America, Europe and Asia where he has built, recruited, managed, and grown sales operations. He brings with him an extensive background of integrating business and technology strategies to help MetTel continue driving its record growth . In his new role, he will be responsible for business development and growth in DX for the enterprise channel.\nDickson also brings 20 years of experience helping clients understand the best-of-breed technologies available to meet ever-changing communications needs. He will focus on UC to help enterprises understand and embrace the rise of the mobile workforce. David's historical knowledge and expertise will help inform the strategy behind MetTel's customers' implementation of customized communications solutions.\n\"Peter and David join the team at the perfect time as we continue to become the digital transformation agents of choice for our clients in various industries, overhauling IT infrastructure and all that it supports,\" said Marshall Aronow, CEO of MetTel. \"Both executives understand the business aspirations and challenges of clients going through digital transformation and have the insight and experience to provide the best possible solutions.\"\nDigital transformation impacts every industry and IDC predicts that worldwide spending on DX technologies (hardware, software, and services) will reach nearly $1.3 trillion this year. For enterprises to successfully undergo this transformation, there needs to be a healthy mix of resources, infrastructure, products/services and processes, which need to be continuously monitored. Part of the DX trend involves UC, which is predicted to grow globally to reach $143 billion by 2024, according to Grandview Research .\nMetTel works closely with some of the world's largest enterprises and organizations to simplify DX through its integrated portfolio of technology such as SD-WAN , UC , Fleet/Telematics , IoT , Cloud Computing, Data Analytics and Communications Management . The company also serves several industries and verticals including retail, healthcare, pharmaceutical, energy, manufacturing, distribution, food and beverage, and government organizations.\nBell's previous position was at INAP where he was the Senior Vice President of Global Sales focused on migrating IT workloads to an outsourced solution such as colocation, public cloud or private cloud. Prior to that he was VP and GM of Global Solutions Sales at NTT America where he was responsible for growing their North American presence.\nAs VP of National Channel Sales at Broadview (now a part of Windstream ), Dickson's record of success includes taking the company's hosted Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) product to their salesforce, which eventually became a leading VoIP technology in the industry with more than 250,000 users nationwide.\nAbout MetTel\nMetTel is a leading global provider of integrated digital communications solutions for enterprise customers.
