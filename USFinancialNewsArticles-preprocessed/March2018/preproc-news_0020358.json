    "text": "0 COMMENTS Rarely has a projected slowdown sounded so good.\nLam Research , LRCX 1.83% which makes equipment used in the manufacturing of semiconductors, told analysts on Tuesday that the company expects to generate about $15 billion in revenue by the year 2021. That implies an average of a little less than 12% growth a year from the $9.7 billion the company generated in 2017. Not bad, until one realizes that Lam averaged about 25% growth over the previous four years.\nLam’s shares jumped anyway, rising nearly 5% on Tuesday and gaining another 1% Wednesday morning despite the early market selloff. That is because the company’s projection still implied a better growth rate than what analysts had expected. Because Lam draws more than two-thirds of its current business from sales to memory chip producers, the company was vulnerable to a growing sense of worry that memory prices had hit their peak. Lam’s share price, which had surged 74% last year, had underperformed the PHLX Semiconductor Index this year heading into the meeting.\nAn Applied Materials facility in a picture from 2016. Photo: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News While no one is predicting that memory prices can rise forever, Lam and larger rival Applied Materials have argued convincingly that the business for chip manufacturing gear—long prone to boom-and-bust cycles—is entering a new phase of more sustained growth. More chips are finding their way into growing end markets such as cars, home devices and data centers.\nNew techniques for memory chip production also require more tools for producers just to maintain production levels. Wes Twigg of KeyBanc Capital Markets projects that total semiconductor capital expenditures will rise by 5% this year, even after double-digit gains over the past two years. With demand growing from many points, producers have little choice but to chip in more.\nWrite to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com",
