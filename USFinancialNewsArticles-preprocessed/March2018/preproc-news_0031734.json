    "text": "TARRYTOWN, N.Y., March 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:PBH) (the “Company”) announced today that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Prestige Brands, Inc. (“Prestige Brands”), intends to offer, subject to market and other conditions, $200 million in aggregate principal amount of its 6.375% Senior Notes due 2024 (the “New Notes”). The New Notes being offered will be issued as additional notes under the Indenture dated February 19, 2016, pursuant to which Prestige Brands previously issued $350 million in aggregate principal amount of existing 6.375% Senior Notes due 2024 (the “Existing Notes”).

This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the New Notes and related guarantees. Any offers of the New Notes and related guarantees will be made only by means of a private offering memorandum. The New Notes and related guarantees have not been registered under the Securities Act, or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction, and may not be offered or sold in the United States without registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.\nAbout Prestige Brands Holdings, Inc.\nThe Company markets and distributes brand name over-the-counter healthcare and household cleaning products throughout the U.S. and Canada, Australia, and in certain other international markets.

The \"forward-looking statements\" include, without limitation, statements regarding the Company's expectations regarding the offering of the New Notes. These statements are based on management's estimates and assumptions with respect to future events and financial performance and are believed to be reasonable, though are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict.
