    "text": "53 COMMENTS Hitting upon a potent response to Vladimir Putin were Obama sanctions targeted at his top cronies, later adopted and extended in last year’s bipartisan legislation signed by Donald Trump. \nSanctions aimed at key individuals can be surprisingly effective , it turns out. They help to undermine internal support for the regime or at least its most unattractive policies. \nOne oligarch, though, remains overlooked. Arguably he is the most important of all. That’s former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. \nMr. Putin has worked with astonishing success to reorganize energy logistics in Europe to isolate, threaten and intimidate strategic countries, especially Ukraine, Poland and the Baltic nations. Mr. Schroeder has been his vital helpmate at every step. \nOne of Mr. Schroeder’s last acts before being turned out of office in 2005 was authorizing Nord Stream, a pipeline bypassing key territories and controlled by Russia’s Gazprom . Weeks later, at Mr. Putin’s arrangement, he took up Nord Stream’s lucrative chairmanship. \nHe has since added the chairmanship of Nord Stream 2, a second proposed pipeline that Germany’s now-resurrected coalition government previously approved, though with great reluctance, at the urging of Mr. Schroeder’s former party, the Social Democrats. He added a third, impressive title in September, chairman of Rosneft, the state-owned Russian oil giant at the heart of the Putin kleptocracy.\nMr. Schroeder has been a one-man Trojan horse against every European Union commitment to curb Russian energy leverage and improve the competitiveness of its gas market. Notice that the alternative was never to shut Russian gas out of Germany. It was simply for Germany, at every step, to stop lending itself to the enhancement of Russia’s energy power, with Mr. Schroeder leading the influence brigades.\nHe has also been the most reliable, quotable excuser of Kremlin misbehavior. Days after Moscow’s seizure of Crimea, he rushed off to St. Petersburg to be conspicuously photographed hugging Mr. Putin. Last year’s revelation of the Rosneft job, six weeks before September’s German national elections, was an equally calculated gesture. \nHis bright young successor as head of the Social Democrats let it be known that he viewed the decision as “wrong” and counseled Mr. Schroeder: “You don’t have to take every job that comes along.”\nGermany’s recently retired president, not known for seeking out the press, sought out the press to express disapproval of Mr. Schroeder’s promotion. \nAngela Merkel publicly called the decision “not acceptable” (and then accepted it). \nThus Mr. Schroeder makes himself merely debatable, rather than intolerable. This is how “normalization” really works.\nMr. Schroeder is everything Donald Trump was supposed to be in the fevered dreams of Rep. Adam Schiff —a luxury-loving, paid-up, swaggering instrument of Vladimir Putin. Except there’s no secret about it. He can even boast of being two wives ahead of Mr. Trump. Mr. Schroeder has been down the aisle so many times that the German press dwells on his reputation as the “lord of the rings” more than it does his Putin captivity. \nBy now, too many Germans have apologized for him for too long to think about reversing themselves, even when Mr. Putin’s missiles shoot down a Malaysian airliner. Germany’s allies and its European Union partners, including the quietly frantic Poles and Balts, can’t quite refer to Mr. Schroeder as a Putin agent nestled in the heart of Germany’s political and business elite. His name doesn’t appear on any U.S. government list. Section 241 of last summer’s sanctions law required the U.S. Treasury to identify the “most significant senior foreign political figures and oligarchs” behind the Putin regime. These descriptors would seem to apply to Mr. Schroeder but it remains diplomatically impermissible to say so.\nA term has even been coined by students of European geopolitics: “Schroederization.” Witness the Robert Mueller indictment of Paul Manafort, with its allusions to the recruitment of retired heads of state as paid lobbyists for Russia, understood to include former prime ministers of Italy, Finland and Austria.\nAs a general matter, can targeting sanctions at a few well-placed individuals really help with a problem like Mr. Putin, last seen using a banned nerve agent to kill an inconvenient person on British soil?\nYes. “While Europe’s economic sanctions are having little effect on Russia, those applied by the United States dramatically affect the country and its dealings with Europe,” Germany’s prestigious Handelsblatt newspaper reported in January, referring to U.S. sanctions against Putin cronies.\nBy making it hard for Putin associates to do business or travel in the West, or use its financial system to protect their wealth, the West can seize up the machine that sustains Mr. Putin’s power.\nA kleptocracy can’t function if its beneficiaries can’t secure and enjoy their wealth. Among those currently unimpinged in their enjoyment is former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.",
