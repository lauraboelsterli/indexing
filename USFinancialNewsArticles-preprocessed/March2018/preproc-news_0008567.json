    "text": "2 COMMENTS Westside Pavilion, a shopping mall in west Los Angeles, is the latest retail property to get a makeover that will turn most of its space into offices.\nThe move comes at a time when shoppers increasingly are moving online and mall landlords, in turn, are moving away from retail.\nAcross the U.S., lower-quality malls in lower-income areas are being battered by rising vacancies as retailer bankruptcies and store closures hurt leasing prospects.\nPennsylvania-based department store chain Bon-Ton Stores Inc. BONTQ -7.55% filed for bankruptcy protection in February and announced plans to close 42 stores of its 256 stores. Toys “R” Us Inc., which filed for bankruptcy protection in September, could close an additional 200 stores, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal.\nSince August 2016, mall mainstays Macy’s Inc., Sears Holdings Corp. SHLD -6.59% , and J.C. Penney Co. JCP 1.89% said they would close more than 560 stores in total. Sears, which is downsizing at a faster pace than its peers, had 1,104 stores at the end of the third quarter in 2017, down from 4,038 stores at the end of 2010.\nSome analysts estimate a quarter of the nation’s roughly 1,200 malls will shutter in the coming years as retailers pivot toward online sales channels.\nIn the Westside Pavilion deal, Los Angeles-based Hudson Pacific Properties Inc. HPP 0.38% is forming a joint venture with shopping mall giant Macerich Co. MAC 0.20% that would renovate the mall, turning roughly 80% of the 600,000 square-foot mall into office space. The remaining retail space will be occupied by restaurants and a movie theater. The joint venture will be 75% held by Hudson Pacific and the remainder by Macerich. The total cost is estimated to be between $425 million and $475 million.\n“Westside Pavilion is a perfect opportunity for us to reposition a marquee asset in a premier location—this is what we do best. The project is poised to capture the strong demand from tenants for creative office space on the west side of Los Angeles,” said Victor Coleman, chairman and chief executive of Hudson Pacific, in a press release.\nMore\nJ.C.

Now They Court Them The property’s proximity to the I-405 and I-10 freeways and the light rail station also would make it attractive to office tenants, said the West Coast-focused office landlord.\nThe mall, which is still in operation, will go through a process of winding down lease agreements with tenants. The planned redevelopment is expected to be completed by mid-2021.\nWestside Pavilion has faced competition from newer malls in the area and suffered from declining foot traffic and occupancy levels in recent years. Nordstrom has vacated the mall, while Macy’s is currently carrying out a clearance sale and will close its department store there.\nArt Coppola, chairman and chief executive of Macerich, said the joint venture will enable the Santa Monica, Calif.-based real-estate investment trust to maximize the value of the centrally located mall with new uses.\nMall landlords increasingly are collaborating with operators of other types of property, such as apartments and office buildings, to add more uses to their spaces and keep properties relevant.\nSome department store owners such as Macy’s and Lord & Taylor have recently sold the upper levels of their department stores in Chicago and New York City to office operators. The older downtown stores with large footprints are out-of-date today but have spaces that lend themselves to other uses , such as hotels, office and apartments, analysts said.\nThe growth of e-commerce has hit retailers hard. In Elmira, N.Y., the local mall is struggling to find new tenants and attract shoppers. Video: Jeff Bush/WSJ. Photo: Mike Bradley for The Wall Street Journal Some malls have also added grocery stores, medical centers, entertainment options such as minigolf and theaters, hoping to draw a more consistent base of foot traffic.\nMall of America in Bloomington, Minn., and the Layton Hills Mall in Layton, Utah, for instance, both have aquariums that house sharks and stingrays. In Atlanta, Simon Property Group said it plans to build a 90,000 square-foot health center and a 12-story Class A office building adjacent to Phipps Plaza to create a high-end mixed-use development. The Indianapolis-based mall giant is also planning to replace some department store space at King of Prussia mall in Pennsylvania and Southdale Center in Edina, Minn., with other uses such as office, hotel or apartments.\n“What we are going to see more is the densification of existing sites,” said James Sullivan, managing director at BTIG Research. Mall owners said replacing obsolete department store space with alternative uses will increase the value of the properties.\nWrite to Esther Fung at esther.fung@wsj.com",
