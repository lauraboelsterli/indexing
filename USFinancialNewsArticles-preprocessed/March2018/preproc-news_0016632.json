    "text": "Net sales growth of 16 percent compared to the prior year 1 period reflects increases across each of the Company’s reportable business segments First quarter net income of $9.4 million, an increase of 171 percent compared to the prior year First quarter Adjusted Net Income 2 of $9.7 million or $0.15 per share, an increase of 72 percent compared to the prior year First quarter Adjusted EBITDA 2 of $21.3 million, an increase of 0.9 percent compared to the prior year Entered large and fast growing towables RV segment through the acquisition of Lance Camper, completed in January 2018 Formed strategic alliance with Daimler AG for the sale and service of its Setra product line in North America Reaffirms full year fiscal 2018 outlook for net sales of $2.4 to $2.7 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of $200 to $220 million Updates full year fiscal 2018 net income outlook to a range of $90 to $110 million and Adjusted Net Income to a range of $110 to $125 million\nMILWAUKEE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- REV Group, Inc. (NYSE: REVG) today reported results for the three months ended January 31, 2018 (“first quarter 2018”). Consolidated net sales in the first quarter 2018 were $514.9 million, an increase of 16.2 percent over the three months ended January 28, 2017 (“first quarter 2017”). This increase reflects sales growth in each of the Company’s reported operating segments which was partially driven by the impact of acquisitions.\n“Fiscal year 2018 is off to a good start as we saw continued growth across most of our product categories and we remain on track to meet our full year objectives,” said Tim Sullivan, CEO REV Group, Inc. “We continue to remain highly focused on the execution of our commercial, product and operating strategies to improve profitability as we work towards our long-term goal of an enterprise-wide EBITDA margin in excess of 10 percent. Additionally, we continued to execute on our disciplined capital allocation strategy with the acquisition of Lance Camper this quarter, which enables our entry into the large and fast growing towables RV market. With a strong backlog of $1.24 billion we expect to continue to see improving operating leverage in the business and thus expect earnings growth to exceed sales growth in fiscal year 2018.”\nThe Company’s first quarter 2018 net income was $9.4 million, or $0.14 per diluted share compared to a net loss of $13.3 million, or $0.26 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 net income improved as a result of higher earnings from operations, the benefit of acquisitions, lower interest expense, and the favorable impact of recently enacted U.S. tax reform. Adjusted Net Income for the first quarter 2018 was $9.7 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, which grew 72.0 percent compared to $5.7 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, in the first quarter 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the first quarter 2018 was $21.3 million, representing growth of 0.9 percent over Adjusted EBITDA of $21.1 million in the first quarter 2017. Adjusted EBITDA performance during the quarter benefited from higher net sales and earnings from certain business segments as well as the impact of acquisitions.\nREV Group Segment Highlights\nFire & Emergency Segment\nFire & Emergency (“F&E”) segment net sales were $215.3 million for the first quarter 2018, an increase of $29.9 million, or 16.1 percent, from $185.4 million for the first quarter 2017. The increase in net sales of F&E was driven by results from the Ferrara acquisition completed in April 2017, as well as increased unit volumes. F&E backlog at the end of the first quarter 2018 was up 5.4 percent to $622.3 million compared to $590.3 million at the end of fiscal year 2017.\nF&E Adjusted EBITDA 3 was $18.2 million in the first quarter 2018, which represented growth of 8.7 percent compared to $16.7 million in the first quarter 2017. The increase in F&E Adjusted EBITDA was driven by higher unit volumes and the impact of the Ferrara acquisition. First quarter 2018 F&E Adjusted EBITDA margin was 8.4 percent of net sales compared to 9.0 percent in the first quarter 2017. This decrease was due to the timing and mix of shipments in the quarter.\nCommercial Segment\nCommercial segment net sales for the first quarter 2018 were $132.2 million, an increase of 1.5 percent compared to the first quarter 2017. This increase was the result of higher unit sales in all segment product categories, excluding school bus. School bus sales were down versus the prior year quarter due to lower contractor unit sales. Commercial backlog at the end of the first quarter was $337.8 million, a decrease of 7.8 percent compared to $366.4 million at the end of fiscal year 2017.\nCommercial segment Adjusted EBITDA was $4.5 million in the first quarter 2018 compared to $8.2 million in the first quarter 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 3.4 percent of net sales in the first quarter 2018 compared to 6.3 percent in the first quarter 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a shift in the timing of transit bus shipment as well as lower school bus sales in the quarter.\nDuring the first quarter 2018, REV formed a strategic alliance with Daimler AG’s Setra bus division to expand REVs product offerings in the luxury motorcoach segment. Beginning in our second quarter of 2018, the Company will become Daimler’s exclusive distribution partner for its Setra motor coach brand in North America. In addition, starting in July 2018, the Company will also be exclusively responsible for Setra’s North American after-sales parts and service.\nRecreation Segment\nThe Recreation segment grew net sales to $167.2 million in the first quarter 2018, representing an increase of $40.5 million, or 32.0 percent, from the first quarter 2017. Recreation segment sales growth was the result of strength in its end markets as well as sales from acquired companies. Recreation segment backlog at the end of the first quarter 2018 was $281.8 million, an increase of 94.6 percent from $144.8 million at the end of fiscal year 2017. This significant increase in backlog was positively impacted by the acquired backlog in the Lance Camper business.\nRecreation segment Adjusted EBITDA grew 194.0 percent in the first quarter 2018 to $8.2 million, compared to $2.8 million in the first quarter 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margin in the first quarter 2018 grew 270 basis points to 4.9 percent of net sales compared to 2.2 percent in the first quarter 2017. The expansion in profitability is attributable to higher unit volumes, stronger product mix and the continued benefit from ongoing operating initiatives in addition to the results from acquired companies.\nAt the end of the first quarter 2018, the Company acquired Lance Camper Manufacturing Corporation (“Lance”). Lance adds a premium portfolio of truck campers, towable campers and toy haulers to REV’s existing suite of motorized offerings and gives the Recreation segment access to the higher volume and rapidly growing towables RV market segment. Lance has the number one selling truck camper in the U.S. and has won the National RV Dealer Association’s prestigious Quality Circle Award 16 years running.\nWorking Capital, Liquidity and Capital Allocation\nNet working capital 4 for the Company at January 31, 2018 was $389.3 million compared to $299.7 million at the end of fiscal year 2017. The increase in working capital was primarily due to the normal seasonal increase in inventory compared to the end of fiscal year 2017, as well as the timing of cash disbursements and the impact of the Lance acquisition. Cash and equivalents totaled $12.7 million at January 31, 2018. Total debt at January 31, 2018 was $372.3 million (net of deferred financing costs) and as a result, the Company had $143.4 million available under its ABL revolving credit facility, which was amended to increase its borrowing capacity to $450 million in December 2017. Capital expenditures in the first quarter 2018 were $13.6 million compared to $18.1 million in the prior year quarter.\nFiscal 2018 Full Year Outlook\nMr. Sullivan concluded, “First quarter results were in-line with our expectations and our view of end market demand and macro conditions remains consistent with prior expectations. Therefore, we are reaffirming our prior guidance and are still expecting full fiscal year 2018 revenues of $2.4 to $2.7 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of $200 to $220 million. Based on first quarter results, we are updating our expectation of full fiscal year 2018 net income to be in the range of $90 to $110 million and Adjusted Net Income to be in the range of $110 to $125 million.”\nQuarterly Dividend\nOur board of directors declared a quarterly dividend for our first quarter of fiscal 2018, payable on May 31, 2018, to holders of record on April 30, 2018, in the amount of $0.05 per share of common stock, which equates to a rate of $0.20 per share of common stock on an annualized basis.\nConference Call\nREV Group, Inc. will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 results and outlook on March 8th at 11:00 a.m. ET.

However, management believes that the evaluation of our ongoing operating results may be enhanced by a presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization as adjusted for certain non-recurring, one-time and other adjustments which we believe are not indicative of our underlying operating performance. Adjusted Net Income represents net income as adjusted for certain after-tax, non-recurring, one-time and other adjustments which we believe are not indicative of our underlying operating performance as well as for the add-back of non-cash intangible asset amortization and stock-based compensation.\nThe Company believes that the use of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income provide additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of its operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent under GAAP when used in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP measures. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income to the most closely comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP is included in the financial appendix of this news release.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis news release contains statements that the Company believes to be “ ” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
