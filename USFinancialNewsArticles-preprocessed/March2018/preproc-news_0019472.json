    "text": "SANTA MONICA, Calif., March 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Opiant”) (NASDAQ:OPNT), a specialty pharmaceutical company developing pharmacological treatments for addictions, following the recent approval by its Board of Directors of a resolution changing the Company’s fiscal year-end from July 31 to December 31, today reported financial results for the transition period of August 1, 2017, through December 31, 2017, and provided a corporate update.\n“After successfully paying back SWK its original investment in 2017, thereby reverting back to a right to receive 90% of royalty and milestone payments related to NARCAN® Nasal Spray and a robust clinical development pipeline advancing as planned, we entered 2018 in a much stronger operating position,” said Roger Crystal, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Opiant. “NARCAN® continues to gain commercial traction, which resulted in Opiant recording a total of approximately $11.7 million in royalty and milestone revenue for the five-month period from August 1 through December 31, 2017. In addition, our promising pipeline was further strengthened following the recent positive data from our Phase I clinical study of OPNT003 (intranasal nalmefene) for the treatment of opioid overdose. Based on feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), we intend to pursue a 505(b)(2) development path for OPNT003, with the potential to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for this product candidate in 2020.\"\nRecent Corporate Highlights\nPre-clinical data supporting the continued development of OPNT005 as a heroin vaccine were published online in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry . Received approximately $5.3 million in cash as a result of the exercise of warrants by two individual investors. Rang the Nasdaq Opening Bell to celebrate the Company’s uplisting to the Nasdaq Stock Market.\nFinancial Results for the Five-Month Period Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the five-month period ended December 31, 2017, Opiant generated revenue of approximately $11.8 million, compared to approximately $14.8 million in the five-month period ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was due primarily to the $13.8 million received under the Purchase Agreement with SWK in the five-month period ended December 31, 2016 compared to the recognition of net revenue of $11.7 million arising from the royalties and milestones payments from the sale, by Adapt Pharma Operations Limited, of NARCAN during the five-month period\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the five-month period ended December 31, 2017, were approximately $5.9 million, compared to approximately $1.9 million in the five-month period ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to a $1.1 million increase in stock-based compensation, a $1.0 million increase in severance payments, a $1.0 million increase associated with professional fees and services, and a $0.8 million increase associated with employee salaries and compensation largely due to increased headcount during the five-month period ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the five-month period ended December 31, 2016.\nResearch and development expenses for the five-month period ended December 31, 2017, were approximately $2.5 million, compared to approximately $0.7 million in the five-month period ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to a $1.2 million increase in payments to third parties associated with Opiant’s research and development program.\nSelling expenses were $0.4 million for the five-month period ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.7 million in the corresponding period of 2016.\nFor the five-month period ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported net income of $1.4 million, or $0.66 per basic and $0.31 per diluted share, compared to net income of $11.5 million, or $5.76 per basic and $5.21 per diluted share for the five-month period ended December 31, 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $8.1 million.\nAbout Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nOpiant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing pharmacological treatments for addictions.
