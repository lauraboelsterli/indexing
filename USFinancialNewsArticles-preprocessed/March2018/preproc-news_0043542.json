    "text": "Retired Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens is calling for the repeal of the Second Amendment to allow for significant gun control legislation.\nThe 97-year-old Stevens says in an essay on The New York Times website that repeal would weaken the National Rifle Association's ability to \"block constructive gun control legislation.\"\nStevens was on the losing end of a 2008 ruling in which the high court held that the Second Amendment gives individuals the right to own a gun for self-defense. He had previously called for changing the Second Amendment to permit gun control.\nStevens says the decision in that case, District of Columbia v. Heller, \"has provided the N.R.A. with a propaganda weapon of immense power.\" Stevens retired from the court in 2010, after more than 35 years.\nWATCH: Who makes the AR-15 rifle? show chapters Who makes the AR-15 rifle? 7:01 PM ET Thu, 15 Feb 2018 | 02:19",
