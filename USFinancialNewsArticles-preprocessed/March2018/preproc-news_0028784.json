Photo: Kristin Hoshino for The Wall Street Journal Cocktail hour at Ron Verstappen’s $4.5 million home in a resort community on the island of Kauai in Hawaii usually features some freshly picked local fruit.\n“Passion fruit is just past season now—it makes great daiquiris,” said Mr. Verstappen, 50, the retired founder of Wombat Financial Software. He starts each morning much the same way, with a fruit smoothie—leaving out the alcohol. “I should add kale, I suppose,” he said.\nThe passion fruit and the kale are gathered by Mr. Verstappen himself from the Kukuiula resort’s pick-your-own 7-acre orchard and 6-acre farm, which are reserved for community residents.\nLocavore Living Goes Upscale The farm-to-table movement has moved into high-end planned developments Ben Takahashi, executive chef at Kukuiula, a resort community on Hawaii’s island of Kauai, with farmer Josh McDonald. Kristin Hoshino for The Wall Street Journal 1 of 15 • • • • • The farm-to-table movement helped spawn the agrihood—a planned community that offers vegetable gardens and other agrarian elements. Now, a crop of luxury developments dedicated to a more upscale version of the locavore lifestyle are taking root.\nHomeowners might have unlimited picking rights in landscaped gardens of organic microgreens, berries and flowers. Concierge weeding and watering services are provided for residents who want their own gardens but don’t have the time or inclination to tend them. Resident chefs hold al fresco dinners and cooking workshops, teaching homeowners how to turn the bounty into goodies like breadfruit crisps or pizzas made with home-milled flour.\n“We have five different kinds of bananas growing, and they aren’t the kind you buy in the grocery store,” said Richard Albrecht, president of Kukuiula, the 1,010-acre development that opened in 2010. Home prices range from $1.5 million to $15 million.\nMr. Verstappen and his girlfriend, Kristi Snyder. Fruits and vegetables grown on the resort’s farms are free to homeowners, who pay a onetime $50,000 membership fee and about $26,000 in annual dues. Photo: Kristin Hoshino for The Wall Street Journal More than 70 agrihoods have been created or are in development across the country, said Ed McMahon, a senior resident fellow at the Urban Land Institute. “It’s a high-value, low-cost amenity and it figures into this green, farm-to-table, reduced carbon footprint trend—and people seem to like local everything,” he added.\nIn Palm Springs, Calif., a defunct golf course is being planted with 45 acres of olive trees as the centerpiece of Miralon, a community of 1,150 homes set to break ground this year. The olives will be pressed into oil for residents.\nOutside Charlottesville, Va., lots at Bundoran Farm—a 2,300-acre development called “a working farm”—overlook apple orchards and pastures of sheep and cows.\nMr. Verstappen, right, an avid cook, chats with Ben Takahashi, executive chef at the Hawaiian resort. Photo: Kristin Hoshino for The Wall Street Journal In upstate New York, one Hudson Valley agrihood will produce its own artisanal goat cheese.\nAnd herds of Belted Galloway cows—purely for show—graze at Cooke’s Hope in Easton, Md., where homes are listed from $549,000 to $1.5 million.\nKukuiula’s farm had a modest start as a place where homeowners could pick mangoes and tropical flowers. It has since expanded, with 32 raised vegetable beds, an orchard, chickens and a new so-called superfoods garden planted with goji berries, gotu kola and turmeric. The bounty is free to homeowners, who pay a onetime $50,000 membership fee and about $26,000 in annual dues.\n“Sometimes, we gotta arm wrestle over who takes the arugula today,” said Kukuiula’s executive chef, Ben Takahashi, who experienced a salad-greens shortage over the holidays. He showcases farm produce in weekly chef’s table dinners, and hosts al fresco dinners featuring “guest artisans,” like the pig farmer from up the road.\nThe Hudson Valley, N.Y., agrihood community of Silo Ridge is planning a cooking workshop for kids, among other locavore amenities. Homes there cost $2.5 million to $10 million. Photo: Jeff Lipsky Residents are provided with rubber boots, scissors and bags to pick their own. Other Kukuiulans prefer to visit a refrigerator on a clubhouse porch, stocked with flowers, fruit, lettuces and herbs.\n“I love to cook—it’s become a passion,” said Mr. Verstappen, who built his three-bedroom home overlooking the ocean in 2016. (He also has a home in Lake Tahoe, Nev.) He walks to the farm several times a week, and recently competed in a cook-off there.\nRelated Reading\nAmerica’s New Small Towns: Housing Developments That Recreate Village Life Luxury-Home Developers’ Latest Pitch: Unspoiled Nature Farm-to-Condo Movement Stakes Its Claim to Brooklyn Rooftop At Hudson Woods, a 131 acre-community with 25 homes in New York’s Catskills, buyers can add numerous agrarian upgrades. For $16,500, for example, they can get an orchard of 10 mature fruit trees—planted, bermed, mulched, irrigated and fenced. For $15,500, a master gardener will plant a 20-by-30-foot garden on their property with three months of complimentary weeding and watering.\nDrew Lang, the architect and developer who created Hudson Woods, is working with local sugar makers for homeowners who’d like to have their maple trees tapped for their own limited-batch syrup. “They can take in the experience without going through all the steps themselves,” Mr. Lang said.\nBill Caleo with his children, Willa and Campbell, in their home in the upstate New York community of Hudson Woods. Photo: Jennifer May for The Wall Street Journal Bill Caleo, a real-estate developer based in Brooklyn, spent about $2.1 million to build a three-bedroom weekend home with a pool and a guesthouse on 7 acres in Hudson Woods. His vegetable garden will be planted this spring.\n“It created this world for me that I could envision my family being part of,” said Mr. Caleo, 41, adding that a community gardener will tend his veggies.\nAt Silo Ridge—a new 800-acre development in New York’s Hudson Valley with houses priced from $2.5 million to $10 million—a 2-acre organic garden is being marketed as a prime amenity alongside the Tom Fazio-designed golf course and an equestrian facility. This summer, it will add 12 beehives, a coop of heritage chickens, and goats for yogurt, cheese and ice cream.\nBill Caleo built a weekend home for about $2.1 million in Hudson Woods, where homeowners can opt for agrarian amenities such as fruit orchards and vegetable gardens. Photo: Jennifer May for The Wall Street Journal Jonathan Wright, vice president of culinary operations for Silo Ridge developer Discovery Land Co., also plans a cookery school with classes for kids. “They can grab the eggs from the chickens and mill their own flour and make their own pizza dough,” he said.\nHeather and Andrew Zuckerman, New York City residents, are building a five-bedroom second home with a pool in Silo Ridge’s Club Meadow section, where homes average between $4.5 million and $6 million. They often visit the greenhouse, which garden manager Sandra LaPlace filled with geraniums, fig trees and herbs.\n“I’m not a golfer—the garden really sold me,” said Ms. Zuckerman, 46, an executive at an asset-management firm. “Sandra said, ‘You can come pick vegetables,’ ” she recalled. “I said, ‘Yeah, but can I come weed?’ ”\nMore from Mansion\nUpscale Farm Living (You Don’t Have to Get Your Hands Dirty) March 15, 2018 How Real-Estate Agents Get the Best Homes—for Themselves March 15, 2018 Once an Asylum, Then a Convent, Now a Home March 14, 2018",
