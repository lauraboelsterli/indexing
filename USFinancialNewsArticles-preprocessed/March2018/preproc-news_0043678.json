    "text": "VANCOUVER, March 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Nevsun Resources Ltd. (TSX:NSU) (NYSE American:NSU) (\"Nevsun\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce new assay results from the recently completed $20 million exploration drill program of the Lower Zone at the Timok copper-gold project (\"Timok Project\") in Serbia.\nHighlights\n1.00% Cu and 0.20g/t Au (1.14% Cu equivalent) over 556.8 meters starting at 1,310 meters in TC170177 Including 1.45% Cu, 0.32g/t Au (1.67% Cu equivalent) over 177.0 meters 0.91% Cu and 0.18g/t Au (1.04% Cu equivalent) over 558.0 meters starting at 1,366 meters in TC170187 Including 1.00% Cu, 0.19g/t Au (1.13% Cu equivalent) over 309 meters 0.97% Cu and 0.14g/t Au (1.07% Cu equivalent) over 390.0 meters starting at 1,106 meters in TC170181 Including 1.35% Cu, 0.22g/t Au (1.50% Cu equivalent) over 117 meters; and also 1.06% Cu and 0.21g/t Au (1.21% Cu equivalent) over 312.0 meters starting at 1,583 meters in TC170181 Including 1.47% Cu, 0.32g/t Au (1.69% Cu equivalent) over 165 meters 1.32% Cu and 0.17g/t Au (1.44% Cu equivalent) over 174.0 meters starting at 1,411 meters in TC170185 Including 1.87% Cu, 0.23g/t Au (2.03% Cu equivalent) over 108 meters Cu equivalent calculated as 1g/t Au = 0.7% Cu Intersections estimated to be approximately 50-95% of true width\nTo date 84 drill holes have been drilled within the Lower Zone footprint, of which 78 drill holes comprising approximately 90,571 meters have intersected the deposit or its margins. The geometry of the Lower Zone remains to be fully defined, however current dimensions of the mineralized zone are approximately 2,000 metres long by 1,100 metres wide by 1,400 metres high. The Lower Zone remains open to extension to the North and at depth. Mineralization starts at approximately 700 metres below surface and has been drill tested to a depth of 2,268 metres.\nDetailed drill results, sections and a plan map of drill hole locations are attached to this news release. Holes are near vertical and intersecting a mineralized zone which is plunging to the northwest at approximately 50 degrees.\nNevsun CEO, Peter Kukielski, commented, \"We are truly excited by the enormous potential emerging from our work on the Timok Lower Zone. These assays are from the $20 million Lower Zone drill program we have been working on within our joint venture with Freeport-McMoRan Exploration Corporation (\"Freeport\"). These results continue to demonstrate the potential world class nature of the Lower Zone mineralization. Work is now focussed on Lower Zone resource estimation for the Serbian permitting process and release of a NI43-101 compliant resource statement in mid-2018\".\nPeter Kukielski, continued, \"While we are years away from the potential development of the Lower Zone, when we compare it to other large porphyry deposits, we like what we see. A clearer picture of value will emerge with the release of the initial resource mid year. We believe the Lower Zone represents a store of value for us in an environment where large high quality and well located copper deposits are becoming increasingly rare. We find ourselves in the enviable position to be able to deliver new copper production in the relative near term via the high grade Upper Zone and the future potential of Lower Zone development.\"\nTimok Copper-Gold Project\nThe Timok Project is located in eastern Serbia near the Bor mining and smelting complex. The Timok Project is focussed on the Cukaru Peki (\"Timok\") deposit which includes the high grade Upper Zone (characterized by massive and semi-massive sulphide mineralization) and the Lower Zone (characterized by porphyry-style mineralization).\nThis news release is solely about the Lower Zone. The Company will be releasing the results of its pre-feasibility study on the Upper Zone on March 28, 2018.\nGeology of the Timok Lower Zone\nThe Lower Zone consists of porphyry-type mineralization characterized by chalcopyrite-pyrite and minor bornite and molybdenite occurring as disseminations and within quartz and quartz-magnetite stockwork veinlets. Anhydrite veins are common. Within the Lower Zone, porphyry-type potassic alteration is preserved locally but generally overprinted by sericite-clay, argillic and advanced argillic alteration. The latter overprinting also brings occasional covellite-pyrite mineralization. The host rocks are predominantly volcanic andesite, andesite breccia and andesitic porphyry.\nQuality Assurance\nDrill core samples were collected in accordance with protocols that are compatible with accepted industry procedures and best practice. The Company conducts its own analysis of QAQC generated by the systematic inclusion of certified reference materials, blank samples and duplicate samples. The analytical results from the quality control samples have been evaluated and have been demonstrated to conform to best practice standards.\nMr. Peter Manojlovic, P.Geo., Nevsun's VP Exploration, is a Qualified Person as defined by NI 43-101. Mr. Manojlovic has reviewed the technical content of this press release and approved its dissemination.\nAbout Nevsun Resources Ltd.\nNevsun Resources Ltd. is the 100% owner of the high-grade copper-gold Timok Upper Zone and 60.4% owner of the Timok Lower Zone in Serbia. The Timok Lower Zone is a joint-venture with Freeport-McMoRan Exploration Corporation (\"Freeport\"), which currently owns 39.6% and upon completion of any Feasibility Study, Nevsun Resources Ltd. will own 46% and Freeport will own 54%. Nevsun generates cash flow from its 60% owned copper-zinc Bisha Mine in Eritrea. Nevsun is well positioned with a strong debt-free balance sheet to grow shareholder value through advancing Timok to production.\nForward Looking Statements\nThe above contains forward-looking statements or forward-looking information within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and applicable Canadian securities laws.
