    "text": "March 19, 2018 / 10:10 AM / Updated 2 hours ago Growing Wales depth ahead of 2019 World Cup pleases Gatland Reuters Staff 2 Min Read (Reuters) - Wales head coach Warren Gatland believes his players have gained valuable experience in this year’s Six Nations campaign and is convinced that the squad will have an abundance of talent and depth ahead of next year’s World Cup in Japan. Rugby Union - Six Nations Championship - Wales vs France - Principality Stadium, Cardiff, Britain - March 17, 2018 Wales head coach Warren Gatland before the match REUTERS/Rebecca Naden Cory Hill, Hadleigh Parkes, Aaron Shingler and Josh Navidi were among those who impressed in the absence of key players as Wales finished second behind champions Ireland after Saturday’s win over France. “I think where we are at the moment, we are realistic. What’s pleasing is we have exposed some players to the highest level, so we feel like as we are leading into 2019 that we have got more depth than we had in 2015,” Gatland told reporters. “I think in 12 months’ time we’ll be in a really good place from a starting 23, but what we’ve done is we have exposed a lot more players and the depth we have created has put us in a good position.” Gatland also said that the criticism of England head coach Eddie Jones after England’s fifth-placed finish was not warranted and said Ireland were the best team in the northern hemisphere. “The problem is that sport is so fickle people are going to turn on Eddie over the next few days, but this is a tough tournament to win,” Gatland added. “Wales finished fifth last year and we could have been a lot closer, and the same applies to England this year. “You need a bit of luck. Ireland have had that and will be aware of that. In fairness they are the best team in the northern hemisphere at the moment.” Wales can further test their squad when they play South Africa in Washington and travel to Argentina for two tests in June.
