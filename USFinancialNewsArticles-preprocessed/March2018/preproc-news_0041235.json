    "text": "Fourth quarter total net sales increased 8.0%; comparable store sales increased 2.5% Fourth quarter diluted EPS of $1.11; adjusted diluted EPS of $1.19, excluding one-time charge related to tax reform of $14.6 million Fiscal 2017 total net sales increased 3.2%; comparable store sales increased 0.9% Fiscal year GAAP diluted EPS of $2.10; adjusted diluted EPS of $2.17\nIRVING, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Michaels Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ: MIK) today announced financial results for the 14-week fourth quarter and 53-week fiscal year ended February 3, 2018. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $1.11, which included a negative impact from one-time charges related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) of approximately $0.08 in diluted earnings per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $1.19, an increase of 24.0% from adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.96 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the respective GAAP measures is included in this release.\n“Today, we reported record fourth quarter results driven by a strong holiday performance. Customers responded well to our efforts to make it easier to celebrate the season with an expanded offering of new and exclusive product, more compelling presentations, and strong value statements,” said Chuck Rubin, Chairman and CEO. “In fiscal 2017, we made meaningful progress against each of our strategic priorities, including: delivering a more seamless omnichannel shopping experience; offering trend-right assortments that deliver great customer value; and increasing customer engagement. As I look back at our financial performance for the full year, I am pleased that we delivered sales and earnings growth in-line with the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year and that we continued to generate strong, consistent cash flow.”\nImpact of the 53 rd Week\nThe Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31 st . Fiscal 2017 ended on February 3, 2018, resulting in an extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 (“53 rd week”) as compared to fiscal 2016. The 53 rd week contributed approximately $79 million in sales, approximately $27 million in operating income, and approximately $0.09 in adjusted diluted income per common share.\nFourth Quarter Income Statement Highlights\nNet sales increased 8.0% to $1,890.6 million, from $1,750.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Comparable store sales increased 2.5% (2.0% on a constant currency basis) due to an increase in average ticket and an increase in customer transactions. Gross profit increased 9.7% to $774.5 million, from $705.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased 70 basis points to 41.0% compared to 40.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase, as a percentage of net sales, was due to higher merchandise margin resulting from the Company’s ongoing sourcing initiatives, occupancy cost leverage resulting from the 53 rd week of sales, less discounting activity during the quarter, and the comparison against $1.1 million of net non-recurring, inventory-related purchase accounting adjustments and integration expenses related to the acquisition of Lamrite West in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. These benefits were partially offset by higher distribution-related costs, including higher freight costs, and higher inventory shrinkage. Selling, general and administrative expense, including store pre-opening costs, (“SG&A”) increased 13.8% to $420.2 million, or 22.2% of sales, from $369.2 million, or 21.1% of sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. As expected, the increase in SG&A was primarily due to an increase in incentive-based compensation and expenses resulting from the 53 rd week. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, incentive-based compensation decreased $28.3 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Operating income increased 5.3% to $354.3 million, or 18.7% of sales, compared to $336.6 million, or 19.2% of sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Interest expense increased $4.3 million to $34.8 million, from $30.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to interest expense related to the 53 rd week and higher interest rates on the Company’s term loan credit facility. The effective tax rate was 36.6% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to 36.2% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The higher effective tax rate was primarily due to one-time charges of $14.6 million in the quarter resulting from the enactment of the Tax Act. The charge included provisional adjustments of $10.8 million related to repatriation taxes for accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries and $3.8 million related to the revaluation of net deferred tax assets, reflecting a reduction in the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. These provisional adjustments were partially offset by benefits realized from the Company’s direct sourcing initiatives, a favorable reduction in the annual corporate tax rate, and the recognition of $2.1 million of excess tax benefits associated with the adoption of a new accounting standard related to share-based compensation. Excluding the impact of $14.6 million of one-time charges, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was 32.0%. Net income increased 3.9% to $203.0 million, compared to $195.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $217.5 million, compared to adjusted net income for fiscal 2016 of $195.9 million, an increase of 11.0%. (See additional information in this release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.) Diluted earnings per share increased 16.8% to $1.11, from $0.95 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $1.19, compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 of $0.96, an increase of 24.0%. (See additional information in this release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.) Diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding for the quarter were 182.3 million compared with 203.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company opened one new Michaels store and closed one Aaron Brothers store.\nFiscal 2017 Income Statement Highlights\nNet sales increased 3.2% to $5,362.0 million, from $5,197.3 million in fiscal 2016. The increase in net sales was primarily a result of sales from the operation of 15 new Michaels stores (net of closures) in fiscal 2017 and a 0.9% increase in comparable store sales (0.7% on a constant currency basis). Operating income increased 2.8% to $735.4 million, or 13.7% of sales, compared to $715.3 million, or 13.8% of sales, in fiscal 2016. The increase was due to benefits from higher merchandise margin resulting from the Company’s ongoing sourcing initiatives, the impact of the 53 rd week, and the comparison against $11.4 million of net non-recurring, inventory-related purchase accounting adjustments and integration expenses related to the acquisition of Lamrite West in fiscal 2016. These benefits were offset by higher incentive-based compensation and higher inventory shrinkage. In fiscal 2016, incentive-based compensation decreased $45.6 million compared to fiscal 2015. Net income increased 3.3% to $390.5 million, compared to $378.2 million in fiscal 2016. Adjusted net income for fiscal 2017 was $405.1 million, compared to adjusted net income for fiscal 2016 of $389.6 million, an increase of 4.0%. (See additional information in this release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.) Diluted earnings per share increased 15.4% to $2.10, from $1.82 in fiscal 2016. Diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding for the quarter were 185.6 million compared with 206.4 million in fiscal 2016. Adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2017 was $2.17, compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2016 of $1.88, an increase of 15.4%. (See additional information in this release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.) During fiscal 2017, the Company opened 17 new Michaels stores and one new Pat Catan’s store and relocated 12 Michaels stores. The Company also closed two Michaels stores and 12 Aaron Brothers stores during the year. At the end of fiscal 2017, the Company operated 1,238 Michaels stores, 97 Aaron Brothers stores, and 36 Pat Catan’s stores.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement Highlights\nThe Company ended fiscal 2017 with $425.9 million in cash, $2.7 billion in total debt and $716.6 million in availability under its asset-based revolving credit facility. Total merchandise inventory at the end of fiscal 2017 was $1,123.3 million compared to $1,127.8 million at end of fiscal 2016. Average Michaels inventory on a per store basis, inclusive of distribution centers, in transit and inventory for the Company’s ecommerce site, decreased 1.9% to $810,000, compared to $826,000 at the end of fiscal 2016. During the year, the Company purchased 12.7 million shares, or $249.5 million, under its share repurchase authorization. The total remaining authorization for future repurchases is approximately $350.0 million. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date, and the timing and number of repurchase transactions under the program will depend on market conditions, corporate considerations, debt agreements, and regulatory requirements.\nAaron Brothers Store Closings\nThe Company has completed its strategic review of Aaron Brothers, a small, specialty retail chain primarily focused on custom framing, ready-made frames, wall art and art supplies. In 2018, the Company plans to close 94 full-size Aaron Brothers stores and reposition Aaron Brothers as a “store-within-a-store,” providing custom framing services in all Michaels stores. The Company will also rebrand Framerspointe.com , a company-owned online custom framing website, as AaronBrothers.com .\nIn fiscal 2017, Aaron Brothers net sales totaled approximately $110 million and had no material impact on the Company’s operating income. The Company expects the after-tax cost of implementing these changes will be in the range of $37 million to $42 million. The Company anticipates the vast majority of the cost will be recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The Company expects the after-tax cash impact of the changes to be minimal.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\n“Building on the progress we made in fiscal 2017, in fiscal 2018 we will reinvest some of the benefits of tax reform to accelerate planned investments to drive future sales and earnings growth. We will invest to build a foundation to bring ecommerce fulfillment in-house; offer a more seamless omnichannel experience for customers; convert approximately 235 stores to our FMA format to create a more consistent, relevant layout; and strengthen our data analytic capabilities,” continued Rubin. “While this acceleration will result in temporarily elevated levels of operating expense in fiscal 2018, I am confident these investments will position us to increase our market share and expand our leadership in the arts and crafts channel.”\nThe Company’s guidance for fiscal 2018 assumes Aaron Brothers stores were closed as of the start of the fiscal year and excludes any restructuring charges. For fiscal 2018, a 52-week year, the Company expects:\nnet sales will be between $5,217 million and $5,293 million; comparable store sales to increase between 0% and 1.5%; to open 19 new Michaels stores and relocate 17 Michaels stores; adjusted operating income will be in the range of $677 million to $710 million; interest expense will be approximately $144 million; the effective tax rate will be approximately 24%; adjusted diluted earnings per common share will be between $2.19 and $2.32, based on diluted weighted average common shares of approximately 185 million; and capital expenditures will be between $160 million and $170 million.\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company expects:\nnet sales will be between $1,139 million and $1,150 million; comparable store sales to increase 0% to 1.0%; to open eight new Michaels stores and relocate nine Michaels stores; adjusted operating income will be between $121 million and $127 million; interest expense will be approximately $34 million; the effective tax rate will be approximately 24%; and adjusted diluted earnings per common share will be between $0.36 and $0.38, based on diluted weighted average common shares of 184 million.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call to discuss the Company’s financial results is scheduled for today, March 22, 2018, at 8:00 a.m. Central Time.

The Company has reconciled these non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in a table accompanying this release. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures not only provide its management with comparable financial data for internal financial analysis but also provide meaningful supplemental information to investors. Specifically, these non-GAAP financial measures allow investors to better understand the performance of the Company's business and facilitate a meaningful evaluation of its quarterly and fiscal 2017 diluted earnings per common share and actual results on a comparable basis with its quarterly and fiscal 2016 results.\nIn evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures, investors should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses or be involved in transactions that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The Company's presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed to imply that its future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. The Company has provided this information as a means to evaluate the results of its ongoing operations. Other companies in the Company's industry may calculate these items differently than it does. Each of these measures is not a measure of performance under GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for the most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release includes which reflect management's current views and estimates regarding the Company's industry, business strategy, goals, and expectations concerning its market position, future operations, margins, profitability, capital expenditures, share repurchases, liquidity and capital resources, and other financial and operating information.
