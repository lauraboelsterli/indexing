    "text": "  4:18 p.m. ET Share \nChecks on one-man rule had been in place since Mao’s death Reuters Chinese President Xi Jinping applauds after the parliament passed a constitutional amendment lifting presidential term limits on Sunday in Beijing. \nBy Chun Han Wong \nBEIJING — Since China’s Communist Party unveiled plans to let Xi Jinping remain president indefinitely, delegates to the national legislature have gushingly likened him to a Buddhist saint or the world’s longest-serving monarch. \nTheir devotion translated into a near-unanimous vote on Sunday to scrap presidential term limits and approve other constitutional changes to entrench Xi and his Communist Party’s dominance over Chinese life. \nThe vote, a formality for a congress dominated by Xi’s ruling party, stripped away an institutional check against one-man rule installed after the 1976 death of Mao Zedong, whose autocratic rule was marked by policy disasters and bloody power struggles. \nIt brought presidential tenures in line with Xi’s other, more powerful, posts of party chief and military-commission chairman, which aren’t subject to formal term limits. Delegates and officials say “centralized, unified leadership” under Xi will allow continuity in decision-making to better steer China’s modernization. Others saw the change as setting China on a risky path. The revision “disrupts the key feature that the Chinese Communist Party, unlike most other communist parties, had been able to achieve: leadership succession,” said Daniel Leese, a professor at Germany’s University of Freiburg. “The risk of compiling all power in one hand will become visible most clearly in periods of crisis,” said Leese, who has studied the Mao personality cult.",
