    "text": "World News Israeli police question Netanyahu over telecom case Police investigators entered Netanyahu's residence Friday morning. An Associated Press cameraman saw them leave about five hours later. Netanyahu's wife, Sara, was questioned at another location at the same time as the prime minister. Published 7 Hours Ago The Associated Press Abir Sultan | Pool | Reuters Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends the weekly cabinet meeting at his office in Jerusalem March 5, 2017. \nIsraeli police questioned Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife as part of an investigation into a corruption case involving the country's telecom giant on Friday, casting a shadow on the prime minister's upcoming visit to Washington. \nPolice investigators entered Netanyahu's residence Friday morning. An Associated Press cameraman saw them leave about five hours later. \nNetanyahu's wife, Sara, was questioned at another location at the same time as the prime minister. \nPolice later issued a statement saying the couple \"were questioned for a number of hours as part of an investigation\" by police and the Israel Securities Authority. \nLast month, two Netanyahu confidants were arrested on suspicion of promoting regulation worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the Bezeq telecom company. In return, Bezeq's news site, Walla, allegedly provided positive Netanyahu coverage. \nIt's the first time that Netanyahu, who as prime minister also held the communications portfolio until last year, is being questioned over the affair, known as Case 4000. \nThe development comes ahead of Netanyahu's visit to Washington where he is to meet with President Donald Trump and speak before the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC next week. \nPolice have recommended indicting Netanyahu on corruption charges in two other cases. \nNetanyahu is accused of accepting nearly $300,000 in lavish gifts from Hollywood mogul Arnon Milchan and Australian billionaire James Packer. In return, police say Netanyahu operated on Milchan's behalf on U.S. visa matters, legislated a tax break and connected him with an Indian businessman. \nIn the other case, Netanyahu is accused of offering a newspaper publisher legislation that would weaken his paper's main rival in return for more favorable coverage. Netanyahu reportedly was recorded asking Arnon Mozes, the publisher of Yediot Ahronot, for positive coverage in exchange for helping to weaken Israel Hayom, a free pro-Netanyahu newspaper that had cut into Yediot's business. \nNetanyahu has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and has dismissed the accusations as a witch hunt orchestrated by a hostile media.",
