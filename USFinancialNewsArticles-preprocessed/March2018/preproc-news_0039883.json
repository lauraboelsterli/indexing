    "text": "Today, at least a half-million people are expected to attend the March For Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C. and over 800 sister marches across the world.\nTo support the organizers of the march, former president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama wrote them a special letter.\n\"We wanted to let you know how inspired we have been by the resilience, resolve and solidarity that you have all shown in the wake of unspeakable tragedy,\" the couple wrote, according to a copy of the letter obtained by Mic .\nMic tweet\nFollowing the deadly shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14, student survivors Emma Gonz치lez, David Hogg, Jacklyn Corinn, Alex Wind, Cameron Kasky and Ryan Deitsch turned to activism and organized March For Our Lives to urge legislators to make changes to gun laws and put an end to mass shootings.\nPaul Marotta | Getty Images Survivors of Stoneman Douglas High School shooting (L-R) Emma Gonzalez, David Hogg, Cameron Kasky and Alex Wind speak at a panel discussion titled '#NEVERAGAIN: How Parkland Students are Changing the Conversation on Guns' moderated by Meighan Stone at Harvard University on March 20, 2018 . \"Not only have you supported and comforted each other, but you've helped awaken the conscience of the nation, and challenged decision-makers to make the safety of our children the country's top priority,\" the Obamas wrote in the letter, dated March 10. CNBC Make It reached out to the Obama Foundation for comment but did not receive a response before publication.\nThe couple also expressed their support for the Parkland students in the days following the tragedy. On February 15th the former president tweeted that \"we are not powerless. Caring for our kids is our first job.\"\nObama feb 15\nAbout a week later, he emphasized that \"young people have helped lead all our great movements.\"\nObama feb 22\nThe former first lady shared her faith in and support for the students as well.\nMichelle feb 21\nGonz치lez shared her appreciation for Michelle's message by responding with a GIF from the NBC show \"Parks and Recreation,\" featuring Amy Poehler's character Leslie Knope saying, \"I agree with you on all the things. Throughout history until the end of time forever.\"\nEmma tweet\nThe Obamas ended their letter by highlighting the historical significance of the students' persistence.\n\"Throughout our history, young people like you have led the way in making America better. There may be setbacks; you may sometimes feel like progress is too slow in coming,\" the couple wrote. \"But we have no doubt you are going to make an enormous difference in the days and years to come, and we will be there for you.\"\nLike this story?
