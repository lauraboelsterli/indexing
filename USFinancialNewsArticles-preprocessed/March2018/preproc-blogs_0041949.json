    "text": "/ ethiopia Elon Musk could make $55 billion from new pay plan…if he delivers \nTesla shareholders have approved by a wide margin a proposal to award chairman and CEO Elon Musk a massive multibillion-dollar stock grant, a source at the meeting told CNBC. \nMaster Plan, where he outlined a future for Tesla as a fully integrated sustainable energy company and mass market electric automaker. \n“If all of these milestones were to be achieved,” said Tesla’s proxy statement, “Tesla will have meaningfully achieved its mission of transitioning the world to sustainable energy and will have become one of the most valuable and successful companies in the world. This is our ambition.” \nShares were recently trading up almost 4 percent. \n“Investors aren’t bothered by the fact that Tesla lost more money than people thought they would, or have had continued Model 3 misses,” Loup Ventures managing partner Gene Munster told CNBC. “They see a bigger opportunity over the long-term, and that opportunity is figuring out the trifecta between energy capture, storage and use.” \nSome large institutional shareholders supported the proposal, such as T. Rowe Price, which has a 6.4 percent stake in Tesla. \nBut some analysts are skeptical of the plan. \nCFRA analyst Efraim Levy reiterated his sell rating on Tesla following the vote. \n“We view the arrangement as a potential win-win for both shareholders and Musk, as the objectives are aligned to a shareholder-friendly combination of aggressive market capitalization objectives as well as a series of operational targets,” Levy said. “Still, we question why Musk has to be incentivized so highly given his high equity interest in TSLA and risks to his personal reputation. We view TSLA shares as expensive at current valuations, despite our forecast of 2019 profitability.” \nAnd proxy advisers Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) recommended rejecting the proposal, citing its high cost, potential to dilute shares, and other issues. Glass Lewis called the sheer upfront cost of the plan “staggering,” and said it has serious potential to dilute the stock. \n“The absolute costs to shareholders of this grant if approved and earned are substantial, but the amount of share capital used is even more eye watering on a relative basis,” the firm said. \nISS said the plan provides “pay opportunities over the next 10 years that dwarf those of top executives at the largest and most profitable public companies.” \nThe firm also said that Musk can earn a lot of money under the plan even if Tesla does not achieve sustained profitability. \n“Three-quarters of the award may vest even if the company does not meet any of the commensurate adjusted EBITDA hurdles, the only profitability metric included in the plan,” the ISS report said. \nMusk and his brother Kimbal recused themselves from the vote. Both are Tesla board members. Musk already owns about 20 percent of Tesla shares, which ISS said was already enough of a stake to consider Musk’s interests aligned with those of shareholders. \nThe vote comes at a time when Tesla shares are dropping from an all-time high set in September , over concerns about the Model 3 production ramp. \n–CNBC’s Lora Kolodny contributed to this article.
