    "text": "36 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—Lawrence Kudlow is set to become the 11th person to serve as the director of the White House National Economic Council, replacing Gary Cohn.\nMr. Cohn boosted the council’s effectiveness, compared to others in the Trump administration, in part because he delegated significant autonomy to the specialists on tax, finance, health care and infrastructure whom he recruited to join the policy-making body.\nOperating out of the White House, the NEC is tasked with ensuring economic policy across different executive branch agencies is on the same page, and the NEC director often has to hash out interagency disagreements.\nPresident Bill Clinton created the body in 1993 to play that process-oriented role, and it had a similar function in the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\nWhile the NEC has had directors with a high profile, such as Mr. Cohn or former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, it has just as often been led by lesser-known workhorse policy wonks. Their effectiveness rises and falls with their ability to resolve internal disputes and translate the president’s goals into actual policies.\nPeople familiar with the NEC’s dynamic say Mr. Kudlow’s appointment is unlikely to lead to major turnover on the staff, which might have been the case if one of Mr. Cohn’s rivals, such as trade adviser Peter Navarro, had gotten the job instead.\nMore Politics\nMueller Subpoenas Trump Organization in Russia Probe March 15, 2018 Grassley Says He’d Be Uneasy With Firing of Sessions March 15, 2018 Author Alleges China Used Family Deals to Influence McConnell, Biden March 15, 2018 Surplus or Deficit?

It has been tasked with coming up with the administration’s proposal to spend $200 billion on infrastructure.\nMr. Cohn was less successful on international economic issues. He argued against pulling out of the Paris climate accord and had been encouraging Mr. Trump to take less dramatic action on trade.\nIn addition to resolving policy disputes, the NEC also fills an important function in managing personnel decisions for executive and regulatory agencies, including the Federal Reserve. It oversaw the process last year that resulted in President Donald Trump’s nomination of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell .\nRelated\nKudlow Accepts Post as White House Economic Adviser Kudlow Is Fan and Critic of Trump’s Economic Positions Commentary by Larry Kudlow and Stephen Moore: Who’s Afraid of Higher Wages? Gary Cohn Resigns as White House Economic Adviser After Losing Tariffs Fight Sign Up: Real Time Economics newsletter Compared with other agencies such as the Treasury Department or Office of Management and Budget, the National Economic Council has little authority beyond whatever power the president invests in it. It is also relatively small. The council currently has around 13 policy specialists.\nThe NEC director sometimes serves as a public spokesman for the White House’s economic policies, appearing on TV after the release of major economic reports, such as the monthly jobs report.\nMr. Kudlow’s background as a television host leaves him particularly well suited for this part of the job, and Mr. Trump was said to be interested in tapping Mr. Kudlow because he thought he would make a good salesman for the administration’s economic agenda.\nThere could be limits to Mr. Kudlow’s effectiveness as a salesman because he has publicly opposed many of Mr. Trump’s policy desires on trade. Where Mr. Trump has toyed with pulling out of the North American Free Trade Agreement, for example, Mr. Kudlow is a steadfast supporter of Nafta and has been strongly on the record opposing such a withdrawal.\nIf Mr. Trump makes more protectionist moves, that could put Mr. Kudlow in the uncomfortable position of either selling policies he has spent the last 20 years opposing, including as recently as last week, or breaking with his boss.\nWrite to Nick Timiraos at nick.timiraos@wsj.com",
