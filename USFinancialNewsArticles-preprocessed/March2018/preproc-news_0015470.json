    "text": "Net Income of $147,000 in fourth quarter of 2017, up 674% from fourth quarter of 2016 2017 Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.4 million vs. 2016 Adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 million Net Loss Per Share Reduced 43% from ($0.07) in 2016 to ($0.04) in 2017\nROCHESTER, N.Y., March 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Document Security Systems, Inc. (NYSE American:DSS) (“DSS”), a leader in anti-counterfeit, authentication, and diversion protection technologies whose products and solutions are used by governments, corporations and financial institutions to defeat fraud and to help ensure product authenticity, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\n“While 2017 was our first full year of integrating our AuthentiGuard technology within a global customer’s supply chain, we are very pleased with its progress and execution, as well as with the additional AuthentiGuard opportunities currently in our development pipeline,” stated Jeff Ronaldi, CEO of DSS.\n“Sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 7% for our printed products division and was the largest sales quarter for that group in our history. Those revenues were countered by a reduction in technology-based sales, affected by a slowdown in the reported usage of AuthentiGuard during the latter part of 2017. However, we were able to generate a meaningful net profit during the quarter, which points to the strength of our combined business segments,” added Ronaldi.\n\"For the full year 2017, along with major strides in our AuthentiGuard product development and rollout, we also began our expansion into the Asia Pacific market with the opening of our Hong Kong office, and the formation of the DSS International team. This new location will allow us to service our existing customers in the region, and to hopefully capitalize on the demand for anti-counterfeit technology in the Asia Pacific market. The expansion and investment into the Asia Pacific market is a strategic component to the planned growth of DSS – and was achieved while we increased our year-over-year profitability to over $1.4 million, as measured by our Adjusted EBITDA,” said Ronaldi.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased slightly to $5.83 million from $5.79 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet income during the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 674% to approximately $147,000 ($0.01 per share), as compared to a net income of $19,000 ($0.00 per share) during the fourth quarter of 2016.\nCosts and expenses for the fourth quarter totaled $5.6 million, a decrease of 1% from $5.7 million during the same period of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA 1 for the fourth quarter of 2017 was approximately $590,000 as compared to $662,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016, which represents an 11% decrease. The decline in Adjusted EBITDA was mostly driven by increases in costs of goods sold.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nRevenue for the year 2017 decreased 3% to $18.7 million from $19.2 million in 2016. Printed products revenue decreased 1% as compared to 2016, with the decrease in the sales of printing and packaging products of 3%, offset by an increase in sales of plastic card products of 3%.\nAdjusted EBITDA totaled $1.4 million in 2017 compared to an Adjusted EBITDA $1.1 million in 2016. The improvement in Adjusted EBIDTA for the year reflects the decrease in costs, especially sales, general, and administrative compensation, professional fees, and stock-based compensation costs.\nCosts and expenses for the year 2017 totaled $18.9 million, a decrease of 5% from $19.8 million in 2016.\nDuring 2017, the Company reported a reduction in its net loss of $578,000, or $(0.04) per share, as compared to net loss of $950,000 or $(0.07) per share in 2016. The improvement in net loss is primarily due to significant reductions in sales, general, and administrative compensation, professional fees, and stock-based compensation costs incurred during 2017.\nABOUT DOCUMENT SECURITY SYSTEMS, INC.\nFor over 15 years, Document Security Systems, Inc.

The Company calculates Adjusted EBITDA by adding back to net income (loss): interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and impairment charges as further adjusted to add back stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA is provided to investors to supplement the results of operations reported in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides an additional tool for investors to use in comparing the Company’s financial results with other companies in the industry, many of which also use Adjusted EBITDA in their communications to investors. By excluding non-cash charges such as amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation and impairment charges, as well as non-operating charges for interest and income taxes, investors can evaluate the Company's operations and its ability to generate cash flows from operations and can compare its results on a more consistent basis to the results of other companies in the industry. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate potential acquisitions, establish internal budgets and goals, and evaluate performance of its business units and management. The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA to be an important indicator of the Company's operational strength and performance of its business and a useful measure of the Company's historical and prospective operating trends. However, there are significant limitations to the use of Adjusted EBITDA since it excludes interest income and expense and income taxes and non-recurring items such as goodwill impairments, each of which impact the Company's profitability and operating cash flows, as well as depreciation, amortization, impairment charges and stock-based compensation. The Company believes that these limitations are compensated by clearly identifying the difference between the two measures. Consequently, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income and loss presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA as defined by the Company may not be comparable with similarly named measures provided by other entities. The following is a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA loss:\nNon-GAAP Financial Performance Measure\nThree Months Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % change 2017 2016 % change (unaudited) (unaudited) (unaudited) (unaudited) Net income (loss): $ 147,000 $ 19,000 674 % $ (578,000 ) $ (950,000 ) -39 % Add backs: Depreciation & amortization 372,000 343,000 8 % 1,414,000 1,392,000 2 % Stock based compensation 12,000 241,000 -95 % 215,000 329,000 -35 % Interest, Net 53,000 62,000 -15 % 219,000 279,000 -22 % Amortization of note discount 41,000 - 100 % 154,000 - 100 % Income Taxes (35,000 ) (3,000 ) 1067 % (21,000 ) 11,000 -291 % Adjusted EBITDA 590,000 662,000 -11 % 1,403,000 1,061,000 32 % Adjusted EBITDA, by group (unaudited) Printed Products $ 899,000 $ 858,000 5 % $ 2,745,000 $ 2,897,000 -5 % Technology Management (47,000 ) 119,000 -139 % (374,000 ) (556,000 ) -33 % Corporate (262,000 ) (315,000 ) -17 % (968,000 ) (1,280,000 ) -24 % 590,000 662,000 -11 % 1,403,000 1,061,000 32 %\nSource:Document Security Systems Inc.",
