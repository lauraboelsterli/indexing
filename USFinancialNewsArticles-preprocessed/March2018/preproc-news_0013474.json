U.S. consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble was reported to be cutting ad agency spending by $1.25 billion over the next three years, the latest blow to the agency model .\nFrench ad agency Publicis fell 1.9 percent to the bottom of the CAC 40.\nHill & Smith shares jumped 4.9 percent after the infrastructure products maker reported record revenue and profits in its full-year results.\n“The outlook is generally positive across the Group, with any progress on a Trump infrastructure plan likely to help sentiment,” N+1 Singer analysts wrote, adding there may also be potential for M&A.\nOverall, analysts have been revising earnings lower for the FTSE 100 in recent weeks as the index struggles at 14-month lows.\nReporting by Helen Reid and Danilo Masoni; editing by Larry King\n ",
