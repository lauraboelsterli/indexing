    "text": "TORONTO, March 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Canaccord Genuity is pleased to announce the expansion of its North American Debt Finance & Restructuring practice with the addition of Brian Bacal as Managing Director and Head of Canadian Restructuring.\n\"We are very pleased to welcome Brian Bacal, who brings an outstanding track record of advising on a broad range of restructuring engagements both in Canada and the U.S.,\" said Chris Blackwell, Managing Director and Head of Investment Banking. \"The addition of dedicated Canadian-based expertise adds a strong complement for our existing team in the U.S. and strengthens our advisory capability for clients in Canada.\"\nThe Canaccord Genuity Debt Finance & Restructuring team provides fully independent strategic advice without the inherent conflict of its lending competitors. The group draws upon deep expertise and relationships across a fully integrated global platform, to deliver a broad range of opportunities and solutions for companies seeking to better utilize their balance sheets and unlock greater value within their capital structure.\nStarting in April, Brian will be based in Toronto and will work closely with our restructuring advisory professionals in Canaccord Genuity's U.S. operation. Together, they will build upon Canaccord Genuity's history of restructuring advisory mandates with notable U.S. and Canadian companies, while they continue to enhance collaboration with their counterparts across the firm's global operations.\nBrian brings more than a decade of experience to his role, most recently as a senior member of the recapitalization and restructuring group at Moelis & Company, where he led coverage in Canada for the group and advised on many Canadian, U.S. and cross-border assignments since 2009. In this role, he oversaw in-court and out-of-court financial restructurings, provided advisory services including liability management and reduction, covenant amendments, maturity extensions, stressed and distressed asset acquisitions and sales, and insolvency planning and execution. Brian has led multi-party negotiations on behalf of creditors and debtors and his expertise spans nearly every major industry sector, including aerospace, consumer goods, energy, financial institutions, industrials, healthcare, infrastructure, lodging, media, metals and mining, power & utilities, retail, services, technology and telecom. He began his career at Greenhill & Co. in 2006. Brian holds an HBA from the Richard Ivey School of Business.\nABOUT CANACCORD GENUITY\nCanaccord Genuity is the global capital markets division of Canaccord Genuity Group Inc.
