Boston was already playing without star guard Kyrie Irving, who is recovering from a recent left knee procedure.\nX-rays on Morris’ ankle came back negative, the team announced.\nWith his game-high point total, Tatum became the ninth rookie in Celtics’ franchise history to notch 1,000 points in his debut season.\nAfter putting up a career-high 33 points with five rebounds, five steals and three assists Sunday in a win at Sacramento, Boston’s Terry Rozier finished with 16 points, seven boards and three assists Monday.\nA 31-point first quarter sent the Celtics out to a 16-point lead before Phoenix found a groove and outscored the visitors 30-17 in the second to pull within 48-45 at halftime.\nBoston padded its lead with a 29-point third quarter to make it 77-65 going into the fourth.\nPhoenix hung around in the final period and got within single digits on Ulis’ 3-pointer with 13.3 seconds remaining.\nThe Celtics led by as many as 20 while the Suns’ biggest lead was three.\nBoston completes its four-game road trip Wednesday in Utah. Phoenix concludes a quick two-game homestand Wednesday against the Los Angeles Clippers.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
