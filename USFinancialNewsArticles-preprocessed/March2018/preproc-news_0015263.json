    "text": "NEW YORK, March 6 (Reuters) - Scott Duffy, head of physical and structured crude and products trading at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML) has left the firm, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\nDuffy was previously head of crude oil derivatives trading at BAML. He also worked at Goldman Sachs Group Inc as a crude trader for more than a decade, according to his LinkedIn profile.\nIt was not immediately clear where Duffy would be going.\nA spokeswoman for Bank of America declined to comment.\nCommodity trading firms and banks posted major losses in 2017 due to muted client activity and volatility in energy markets.\nSeveral key commodities traders have left rival Goldman Sachs as the Wall Street firm seeks to turn around its struggling commodities unit.
