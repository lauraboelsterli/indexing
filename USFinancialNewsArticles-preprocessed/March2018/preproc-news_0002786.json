    "text": "TOKYO, March 5 (Reuters) - Japan’s Nikkei share average extended losses into a fourth day as concerns over a global trade war dented sentiment, with steelmakers, automakers and shipping companies underperforming the market.\nThe Nikkei fell 0.5 percent to 21,075.44 in midmorning trade, after the yen got a lift from safe-haven flows as risk sentiment soured after U.S. President Donald Trump proposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminium.\nSteel shares tumbled again, with Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal dropping 1.5 percent, JFE Holdings and Kobe Steel sliding 1.5 percent.\nAutomakers, big consumers of steel and aluminium, also lost ground. Honda Motor Co fell 1.8 percent, Toyota Motor Corp dropped 1.4 percent and Subaru Corp shed 1.1 percent.\nShippers were sold, with Mitsui OSK Lines falling 2.5 percent and Kawasaki Kisen off 2.1 percent.\nWith the dollar falling for a fourth straight session, investors have started to worry that Japanese companies will have to lower their dollar-yen assumptions for the next fiscal year, which would impact their profit outlook.\nThe dollar stood at 105.43 yen, slightly above Friday’s low of 105.23, a level not seen since November 2016.\nThe broader Topix dropped 0.7 percent to 1,696.91.\nReporting by Ayai Tomisawa; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ",
