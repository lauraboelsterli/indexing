Our Big Data as a Service (BDaaS) tools will be applied to the fintech market, taking advantage of the current need for crypto-mining hosting services as overseas operations look to Canada for expansion and re-location. Recent advances in our data collection hardware, combined with the blockchain expertise of Connected's staff and contractors, will allow us to continue development of our smart contract and M2M transaction solutions based on blockchain technology.\"\nJay Yu, CEO of Connected, remarked, \"Merging with Carl Data will allow us to accelerate our expansion plans. The Carl team brings a wealth of experience in big data and AI that will help Connected Fintech offer value added services to our clients. This will provide a real competitive advantage in attracting clients who use us for hosting their cryptocurrency mining servers. Our relationship this past year has strengthened, and working with CEO, Greg Johnson and the rest of Carl's management team is an ideal fit for us. I am excited to become part of such a dynamic public company.\"\nPursuant to the LOI, Carl Data and Connected have agreed to use their commercial best efforts to formulate a structure for the Acquisition that will comply with all necessary legal and regulatory requirements, minimize or eliminate adverse tax consequences and be as cost effective as possible.

Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements and, even if such actual results are realized or substantially realized, there can be no assurance that they will have the expected consequences to, or effects on, the Company. Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from current expectations include, among other things: the Acquisition not completing; the parties not formulating a satisfactory structure for the Acquisition or entering into a definitive agreement; the conditions precedent to closing of the Acquisition not being satisfied; the Acquisition not benefiting the Company as expected or at all; the ability of the Company to establish a market for its services; competitive conditions in the industry; general economic conditions in Canada and globally; the inability to secure additional financing; competition for, among other things, capital and skilled personnel; potential delays or changes in plans with respect to deployment of services or capital expenditures; possibility that government policies or laws may change; technological change; risks related to the Company's competition; the Company's not adequately protecting its intellectual property; interruption or failure of information technology systems; and regulatory risks relating to the Company's business, financings and strategic acquisitions.
