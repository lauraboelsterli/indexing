    "text": "Anthony Mantha scored his team-leading 24th goal of the season, and the Detroit Red Wings pulled away for a 6-3 win over the Buffalo Sabres on Thursday night at KeyBank Center in Buffalo, N.Y.\nDylan Larkin, Darren Helm, Andreas Athanasiou, Danny DeKeyser and Evgeny Svechnikov also scored for the Red Wings. Detroit has won back-to-back games for the first time since February.\nJack Eichel, Ryan O’Reilly and Evan Rodrigues scored for Buffalo, which has lost five of its past six games.\nDetroit goaltender Jimmy Howard stopped 29 of 32 shots for his 21st win of the season and the 220th win of his career. Only Terry Sawchuk (351) and Chris Osgood (317) have won more games with the franchise.\nBuffalo goaltender Robin Lehner surrendered three goals on 20 shots before he was pulled. His replacement, Chad Johnson, allowed three goals on 12 shots.\nBuffalo struck first 3:16 after the opening faceoff. Eichel carried the puck into the offensive zone and fired a wrist shot from the right circle for his 25th goal.\nO’Reilly scored on the power play less than four minutes later to double Buffalo’s lead.\nDetroit responded 30 seconds later to cut the deficit to 2-1. Larkin netted his 13th goal on a wrist shot.\nThe Red Wings evened the score at 2 when Helm scored a short-handed goal at 5:21 of the second period. The goal marked Helm’s third short-handed tally of the season and the fifth of his career.\nMantha put Detroit on top 3-2 when he pounced on a rebound with 3:34 remaining in the second period. Frans Nielsen set up Joe Hicketts for a one-timer, and Mantha punched in the loose puck near the crease.\nA remarkable no-look, backhand pass from Justin Abdelkader set up Athanasiou’s goal to make it 4-2 in the first two minutes of the third period. Athanasiou grinned at the delivery after potting his 15th goal.\nBuffalo climbed within 4-3 when Rodrigues scored with 15:09 to play in the third period.\nDetroit regained a two-goal lead midway through the third period on DeKeyser’s first goal in 17 games.\nSvechnikov finished the scoring for the Red Wings with 3:01 to play.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
