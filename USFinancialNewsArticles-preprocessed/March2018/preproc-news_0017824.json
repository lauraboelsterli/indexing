    "text": "NEWARK, N.J., March 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Genie Energy Ltd. (NYSE: GNE, GNEPRA) reported a fourth quarter 2017 loss of $0.01 per basic and diluted share including the impact of a $6.5 million write-off of capitalized exploration costs. For the full year 2017, Genie Energy reported a loss of $0.36 per basic and diluted share including the impact of a $6.5 million ($0.28 per share) write-off of capitalized exploration costs and $10.5 million ($0.45 per share) in legal and regulatory accruals.\nFINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS\n(4Q17 results are compared to 4Q16, and full year 2017 results are compared to full year 2016, unless otherwise noted)\nGenie Energy is sharpening it strategic focus on its retail energy provider business after its Afek subsidiary suspended exploratory drilling operations in Northern Israel; In December 2017, Genie Energy's retail energy provider joint venture operating in Great Britain initiated customer enrollments under a regulatorily mandated three-month controlled market entry period; Genie Retail Energy's (GRE) income from operations increased to $12.2 million from $2.7 million and Adjusted EBITDA* increased to $12.8 million from $3.1 million on improved electric margins and higher levels of electricity and natural gas consumption; GRE's full year income from operations was $16.6 million and full year Adjusted EBITDA was $18.8 million. Both totals include the impact of $10.5 million in legal and regulatory related accruals. In 2016, GRE's income from operations was $26.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $27.3 million; Genie Energy's Board of Directors has declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.075 per share.\nCOMMENTS OF MICHAEL STEIN, CEO OF GENIE ENERGY\n\"Genie Energy is strategically refocusing on our core retail energy provider business, which has been consistently profitable and where we see continued strong growth potential. On a consolidated basis, this will entail a substantial reduction in oil and gas exploration expense going forward as we move closer to a pure play retail energy provider model.\n\"Genie Retail Energy attained the highest level of quarterly Adjusted EBITDA in the history of our retail business - $12.8 million - highlighted by strong consumption and robust electricity margins. Full year Adjusted EBITDA was $18.8 million, including the impact of $10.5 million in legal and regulatory related accruals.\n\"We are looking forward to building on our momentum in 2018 by executing on our growth strategy including organic meter acquisition, expansion to new geographies and, when opportunities present themselves, strategic acquisitions. On the international front, we are rolling out service in Great Britain while evaluating additional opportunities.\"\n*Adjusted EBITDA for all periods is a non-GAAP measure intended to provide useful information that supplements the core operating results in accordance with GAAP of Genie Energy or the relevant segment. Please refer to the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this release for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS\n$ in millions, except EPS\n4Q17\n3Q17\n4Q16\n4Q17 -4Q16\nChange\n(%/$)\n2017\n2016\n2017-2016\nChange\n(%/$)\nRevenue\n$73.1\n$69.5\n$51.5\n+41.8%\n$264.2\n$212.1\n+24.6%\nGross profit\n$26.8\n$21.8\n$14.6\n+83.6%\n$85.5\n$76.9\n+11.1%\nGross margin percentage\n36.6%\n31.3%\n28.3%\n+830 BP\n32.4%\n36.3%\n(390) BP\nSG&A expense (including stock-based compensation)\n$17.1\n$19.5\n$14.7\n+16.6%\n$80.1\n$61.6\n+30.1%\nStock-based compensation in SG&A\n$1.4\n$1.4\n$1.3\n+8.1%\n$5.2\n$4.8\n+8.3%\nExploration expense**\n$2.3\n$0.8\n$1.6\n+40.8%\n$4.9\n$6.1\n(19.9)%\nWrite-off of capitalized exploration costs\n$6.5\n-\n-\n$6.5\n$6.5\n$41.0\n$(34.5)\nEquity in the (loss) income of AMSO/Genie UK\n$(0.4)\n$(0.2)\n-\n$(0.4)\n$(0.6)\n$(0.2)\n$(0.4)\nIncome (loss) from operations\n$0.4\n$1.4\n$(1.3)\n+$1.7\n$(6.5)\n$(30.5)\n+$24.0\nAdjusted EBITDA*\n$8.9\n$3.3\n$0.3\n+$8.6\n$7.3\n$14.7\n(50.5)%\nNet (loss) income attributable to Genie Energy common stockholders\n$(0.2)\n$0.4\n$(1.2)\n+$1.0\n$(8.5)\n$(26.0)\n+$17.5\nDiluted (loss) earnings per share attributable to Genie Energy common stockholders\n$(0.01)\n$0.02\n$(0.05)\n+$0.04\n$(0.36)\n$(1.14)\n+$0.78\nCapitalized exploration costs\n-\n$2.3\n-\n-\n$5.6\n$12.9\n(56.3)%\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$5.9\n$6.6\n$3.9\n+$2.0\n$9.3\n$15.6\n$(6.3)\n** Genie Energy's Afek Oil & Gas subsidiary accounts for its oil and gas exploration activities under the \"successful efforts\" method of accounting. Under this method, acquisition costs, costs of drilling exploratory wells, and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells are capitalized on the balance sheet as \"Capitalized exploration costs â€“ unproved oil and gas property\" pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves. Exploration costs, other than exploration drilling costs, are charged to expense in the statement of operations as \"Exploration expense\".\nBALANCE SHEET AND CASH FLOW HIGHLIGHTS\nAt December 31, 2017, Genie Energy had $125.8 million in total assets, including $31.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (short and long term). Liabilities totaled $58.7 million and working capital (current assets less current liabilities) totaled $35.4 million.\nGenie Energy's net cash provided by operating activities in 4Q17 was $5.9 million compared to $3.9 million in the year ago quarter.\nDIVIDEND ON GENIE ENERGY COMMON STOCK\nGenie Energy's Board of Directors has declared a 4Q17 dividend of $0.075 per share of Class A and Class B common stock with a record date of March 19, 2018. The dividend will be paid on or about March 23, 2018. The distribution will be treated as an ordinary dividend for income tax purposes.\nRESULTS BY SEGMENT\n$ in millions\n4Q17\n3Q17\n4Q16\n4Q17-4Q16\nChange\n(%/$)\n2017\n2016\n2017-2016\nChange\n(%)/$)\nGenie Retail Energy\nTotal revenue\n$73.1\n$69.5\n$51.5\n+41.8%\n$264.2\n$212.1\n+24.6%\nElectricity revenue\n$58.5\n$66.2\n$41.0\n+42.9%\n$222.2\n$179.5\n+23.8%\nNatural gas revenue\n$14.1\n$2.8\n$10.1\n+38.9%\n$40.1\n$31.0\n+29.2%\nOther revenue\n$0.5\n$0.5\n$0.4\n+13.9%\n$1.9\n$1.6\n+19.8%\nGross profit\n$26.8\n$21.8\n$14.6\n+83.6%\n$85.5\n$76.9\n+11.1%\nGross margin percentage\n36.6%\n31.3%\n28.3%\n+830 BP\n32.4%\n36.3%\n(390) BP\nSG&A expense\n$14.1\n$16.8\n$11.8\n+19.3%\n$68.4\n$50.4\n+35.5%\nEquity in the loss of Genie UK\n$(0.4)\n$(0.2)\n-\n$(0.4)\n$(0.6)\n-\n$(0.6)\nIncome from operations\n$12.2\n$4.8\n$2.7\n+346.1%\n$16.6\n$26.5\n(37.4)%\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$12.8\n$5.4\n$3.1\n+308.8%\n$18.8\n$27.3\n(31.1)%\nAfek\nG&A expense\n$0.3\n$0.3\n$0.3\n+1.2%\n$1.3\n$1.1\n+24.1%\nExploration expense\n$2.3\n$0.8\n$1.6\n+40.8%\n$4.9\n$6.1\n(19.9)%\nWrite-off of capitalized exploration costs\n$6.5\n-\n-\n+$6.5\n$6.5\n$41.0\n(84.2)%\nLoss from operations\n$(9.1)\n$(1.0)\n$(2.0)\n$(7.1)\n$(12.7)\n$(48.3)\n+$35.6\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$(2.5)\n$(1.0)\n$(1.9)\n$(0.6)\n$(5.9)\n$(7.0)\n+$1.2\nCapitalized exploration costs\n-\n$2.3\n-\n-\n$5.6\n$12.9\n(56.3)%\nGOGAS\nG&A expense\n$0.2\n$0.2\n$0.3\n(7.9)%\n$0.6\n$0.9\n(32.0)%\nResearch & development\n-\n-\n$(0.5)\n$(0.5)\n-\n$(0.3)\n$(0.3)\nEquity in the loss of AMSO\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n$(0.2)\n$0.2\n(Loss) income from operations\n$(0.2)\n$(0.2)\n$0.2\n$(0.5)\n$(0.6)\n$0.4\n$(1.0)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n-\n$(0.1)\n$0.2\n$(0.2)\n$(0.3)\n$(0.8)\n+$5.0\nCorporate\nG&A expense\n$2.5\n$2.2\n$2.3\n6.9%\n$9.8\n$9.2\n7.1%\nStock-based compensation in G&A\n$1.1\n$1.2\n$1.2\n(5.3)%\n$4.4\n$4.4\n2.0%\nLoss from operations\n$(2.5)\n$(2.2)\n$(2.3)\n$(0.2)\n$(9.8)\n$(9.2)\n$(0.7)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$(1.4)\n$(1.0)\n$(1.1)\n$(0.2)\n$(5.4)\n$(4.8)\n$(0.6)\nGenie Retail Energy\nGenie Retail Energy's customer base as measured in residential customer equivalents (RCEs) increased to 301,000 at December 31, 2017 from 283,000 a year earlier, while meters served remained unchanged at 412,000. The year over year increase in RCE's reflects a shift to higher average consumption meters during the course of 2017 (including as a result of the acquisition of Mirabito Natural Gas, a commercial supplier that contributed 11,300 gas RCE's and 970 gas meters at December 31, 2017). Sequentially, RCEs and meters served decreased from 325,000 and 446,000, respectively, at September 30, 2017, reflecting a strategic pullback from customer acquisition activity in certain territories.\nRCEs and Meters at End\nof Quarter (in thousands)\nDecember 31,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nJune 30,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2016\nElectricity RCEs\n228\n243\n219\n220\n218\nNatural gas RCEs\n73\n82\n70\n67\n65\nTotal RCEs\n301\n325\n289\n287\n283\nElectricity meters\n307\n330\n317\n307\n296\nNatural gas meters\n105\n116\n113\n111\n116\nTotal meters\n412\n446\n430\n418\n412\nGross meter acquisitions in 4Q17 increased to 62,000 from 54,000 in the year ago quarter but decreased from 111,000 in 3Q18. Full year gross meter acquisitions were 355,000 compared to 235,000 in 2016. The increase reflects, in part, meters added in 2017 by Town Square Energy following its acquisition in November 2016.\nReflective of the high rates of customer acquisition in recent quarters, GRE's average monthly customer churn increased to 6.9% in 4Q17 from 6.7% in the year ago quarter and was unchanged compared to the prior quarter. For the full year 2017, average monthly churn increased to 6.6% from 6.0% in 2016.\nMeters enrolled in offerings with fixed rate characteristics constituted approximately 39% of GRE's electric load during December 2017 compared to 32% of GRE's load during December 2016 as the customer mix has shifted towards fixed rate.\nGRE generated all of Genie Energy's revenue and gross profit in 2017 and 2016.\nGRE's revenue increased to $73.1 million in 4Q17 from $51.5 million in 4Q16. Full year 2017 revenue increased to $264.2 million from $212.1 million in 2016.\nRevenue from electricity sales in 4Q17 increased to $58.5 million from $41.0 million primarily reflecting a 23.1% increase in kilowatt hours sold and a 16.0% increase in average revenue per kilowatt hour sold. Kilowatt hours sold increased primarily as a result of a shift to higher average consumption electricity meters as well as the increase in meters served.\nFull year 2017 revenue from electricity sales increased to $222.2 million from $179.5 million on a 21.5% increase in kilowatt hours sold â€“ primarily reflecting the Town Square Energy acquisition, a shift to higher average consumption meters and higher average revenue per kilowatt hour sold.\nNatural gas sales in 4Q17 increased to $14.1 million from $10.1 million in 4Q16 reflecting a 14.5% increase in therms sold and a 21.3% increase in average revenue per therm sold reflecting higher natural gas commodity prices. The increase in therms sold reflected, in part, an increase in average consumption per gas meter including the impact of the Mirabito Natural Gas acquisition.\nFull year 2017 natural gas sales increased to $40.1 million from $31.0 million reflecting a 29.2% increase in average revenue per therm sold reflecting higher gas commodity prices while the volume of gas sold was essentially unchanged.\nGRE's gross profit in 4Q17 increased to $26.8 million from $14.6 million in 4Q16. The gross profit on electricity sales increased to $21.6 million from $11.1 million primarily reflecting a 58.0% increase in gross profit per kilowatt sold. The gross profit on natural gas sales increased to $4.8 million from $3.2 in 4Q16 as the increase in revenue per therm sold outpaced the increase in the underlying commodity cost.\nGross profit for full year 2017 increased to $85.5 million from $76.9 million in 2016 primarily reflecting the increase in kilowatt hours sold partially offset by weaker electricity gross margins.\nGRE's gross margin percentage increased to 36.6% in 4Q17 from 28.3% in 4Q16 as average revenue per kilowatt hour increased and average unit cost of electricity was primarily unchanged, as well as improved margins on natural gas sales.\nFull year 2017 gross margin percentage decreased to 32.4% from 36.3% in 2016 as the increases in average revenue per kilowatt hour sold and average revenue per therm sold trailed the increases in the costs of their respective underlying commodities.\nGRE's SG&A expense in 4Q17 increased to $14.1 million from $11.8 million in 4Q16 primarily due to increases in legal fees and compensation expense.\nFull year 2017 SG&A expense increased to $68.4 million from $50.4 million in 2017 reflecting increased gross meter acquisitions and payroll expenses as well as an accrual of $5.4 million in 2017 for the settlement of class action lawsuits.\nGRE's income from operations in 4Q17 increased to $12.2 million and Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12.8 million from $2.7 million and $3.1 million, respectively, in 4Q16 primarily reflecting the increase in gross profit that was only partially offset by the increased SG&A expense.\nGRE's full year 2017 income from operations was $16.6 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $18.8 million including the impact of $10.5 million in legal and regulatory related accruals, compared to income from operations of $26.5 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $27.3 million in 2016.\nGenie Retail Energy â€“ New York Regulatory Update\nIn December 2016, the New York State Public Service Commission (NY PSC) issued an order prohibiting retail energy providers (REPs) in New York State from serving customers enrolled in utility low-income assistance programs (low-income customers).\nChallenges to the order filed by certain REPs and industry groups in New York State courts delayed implementation, but ultimately the State courts upheld the order and on November 29, 2017, the NY PSC instructed the utilities and REPs to begin implementation of the order.\nGRE is complying with the NY PSC's low-income order and has begun the transfer of customers as required. The order will require GRE's REPs to transfer customer accounts comprising approximately 21,000 meters, representing 12,000 RCEs, to their respective incumbent utilities during the first half of 2018.\nSeparately, the NY PSC launched an evidentiary proceeding intended to provide a basis for additional restrictions on the REP industry and competitive retail energy markets. Hearings were held in November and December of 2017, and the presiding administrative law judges have established deadlines for initial and reply briefs from interested parties and the PSC, respectively, later this spring.\nAfek\nGenie Energy announced in November that the preliminary analysis of results from Afek's Ness 10 exploratory well in Northern Israel suggested that the well's target zone does not contain commercially producible quantities of oil or natural gas. Afek suspended exploratory activities and no further drilling activity is planned at this time. The company expects that any additional exploratory drilling in Northern Israel likely would be underwritten at least in part by outside investors and would be contingent upon licensing and permitting.\nGENIE ENERGY EARNINGS CONFERENCE CALL\nThis release is available for download in the \"Investors\" section of the Genie Energy website ( www.genie.com/investor-relations ) and has been filed on a current report (Form 8-K) with the SEC.\nAt 8:30 AM Eastern time today, March 8, 2018, Genie Energy's management will host a conference call to discuss financial and operational results, business outlook and strategy.

2017 and 2016\nIn addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP), Genie Energy also disclosed for the full year and fourth quarter of 2017, as well as for comparable periods, Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nGenie Energy's measure of Adjusted EBITDA consists of gross profit less selling, general and administrative expense, research and development expense, exploration expense and equity in the net loss of joint ventures, plus depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation (which are included in selling, general and administrative expense). Another way of calculating Adjusted EBITDA is to start with income (loss) from operations and add depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, other operating loss, net, and the write-off of capitalized exploration costs, and deduct the gain on consolidation of AMSO, LLC.\nManagement believes that Genie Energy's Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses and gains that may not be indicative of Genie Energy's or the relevant segment's core operating results. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA, among other measures, as a relevant indicator of core operational strengths in its financial and operational decision making. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate operating performance in relation to Genie Energy's competitors. Disclosure of this financial measure may be useful to investors in evaluating performance and allows for greater transparency to the underlying supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. In addition, Genie Energy has historically reported Adjusted EBITDA and believes it is commonly used by readers of financial information in assessing performance, therefore the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in financial reporting at this time.\nManagement refers to Adjusted EBITDA, as well as the GAAP measures gross profit, income (loss) from operations and net income (loss), on a segment and/or consolidated level to facilitate internal and external comparisons to the segments' and Genie Energy's historical operating results, in making operating decisions, for budget and planning purposes, and to form the basis upon which management is compensated.\nAlthough depreciation and amortization are considered operating costs under GAAP, they primarily represent the non-cash current period allocation of costs associated with long-lived assets acquired or constructed in prior periods. While Genie Energy's oil and gas exploration business may be capital intensive, Genie Energy does not expect to incur significant depreciation or depletion expense for the foreseeable future. Genie Energy's operating results exclusive of depreciation and amortization is therefore a useful indicator of its current performance.\nStock-based compensation recognized by Genie Energy and other companies may not be comparable because of the various valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of types of awards that are permitted under GAAP. Stock-based compensation is excluded from Genie Energy's calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because management believes this allows investors to make more meaningful comparisons of the operating results of Genie Energy's core business with the results of other companies. However, stock-based compensation will continue to be a significant expense for Genie Energy for the foreseeable future and an important part of employees' compensation that impacts their performance.\nIn 2016, other operating loss, net, was net expense incurred from drilling and related operations for a water cooperative of agricultural settlements in the Golan Heights. This project was a short-term water drilling project that was outside the scope of Genie Energy's oil and gas exploration business. The other operating loss, net, was therefore excluded from Genie Energy's and the relevant segment's core operating results.\nThe write-off of capitalized exploration costs, which is a component of income (loss) from operations, is also excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. The write-off of capitalized exploration costs is primarily dictated by events and circumstances outside the control of management that trigger an impairment analysis. While there may be similar charges in other periods, the nature and magnitude of these charges can fluctuate markedly and do not reflect the performance of Genie Energy's continuing operations.\nThe gain on consolidation of AMSO, LLC, which is a component of income (loss) from operations, is excluded from the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA. Genie Energy's equity in the net loss of AMSO, LLC (a joint venture with Total until April 30, 2016) was included in Adjusted EBITDA because it was the result of ongoing operations of AMSO, LLC. The gain on consolidation of AMSO, LLC was a non-routine result of Total's withdrawal from AMSO, LLC. The gain is not part of Genie Energy's or the relevant segment's core operating results.\nAdjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, gross profit, income (loss) from operations, cash flow from operating activities, net income (loss), basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share or other measures of liquidity and financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, Genie Energy's measurements of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nFollowing is the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is income (loss) from operations for Genie Energy's reportable segments and net income (loss) for Genie Energy on a consolidated basis.\nGenie Energy Ltd.\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income (Loss)\n(unaudited)\n$ in thousands\nTotal\nGenie\nRetail\nEnergy\nGOGAS\nAfek\nCorporate\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017\n(4Q17)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 8,946\n$ 12,794\n$ 14\n$ (2,501)\n$ (1,361)\nSubtract:\nStock-based compensation\n1,422\n108\n200\n-\n1,114\nDepreciation and amortization\n612\n453\n57\n102\n-\nWrite-off of capitalized exploration costs\n6,483\n-\n-\n6,483\n-\nIncome (loss) from operations\n429\n$ 12,233\n$ (243)\n$ (9,086)\n$ (2,475)\nInterest income\n88\nInterest expense\n(88)\nOther income, net\n29\nProvision for income taxes\n(1,271)\nNet loss\n(813)\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\n1,027\nNet income attributable to Genie Energy Ltd.\n$ 214\nTotal\nGenie\nRetail\nEnergy\nGOGAS\nAfek\nCorporate\nThree Months Ended September 30, 2017\n(3Q17)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 3,301\n$ 5,382\n$ (104)\n$ (963)\n$ (1,014)\nSubtract:\nStock-based compensation\n1,411\n176\n49\n-\n1,186\nDepreciation and amortization\n487\n434\n5\n48\n-\nIncome (loss) from operations\n1,403\n$ 4,772\n$ (158)\n$ (1,011)\n$ (2,200)\nInterest income\n51\nInterest expense\n(67)\nOther income, net\n9\nProvision for income taxes\n(421)\nNet income\n975\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling\ninterests\n(197)\nNet income attributable to Genie Energy Ltd.\n$ 778\nTotal\nGenie\nRetail\nEnergy\nGOGAS\nAfek\nCorporate\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2016\n(4Q16)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 322\n$ 3,130\n$ 226\n$ (1,896)\n$ (1,138)\nSubtract:\nStock-based compensation\n1,316\n137\n2\n-\n1,177\nDepreciation and amortization\n287\n251\n6\n30\n-\nOther operating loss, net\n64\n-\n-\n64\n-\n(Loss) income from operations\n(1,345)\n$ 2,742\n$ 218\n$ (1,990)\n$ (2,315)\nInterest income\n75\nInterest expense\n(23)\nOther income, net\n59\nProvision for income taxes\n(53)\nNet loss\n(1,287)\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\n469\nNet loss attributable to Genie Energy Ltd.\n$ (818)\nGenie Energy Ltd.\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss\n(unaudited)\n$ in thousands\nTotal\nGenie\nRetail\nEnergy\nGOGAS\nAfek\nCorporate\nYear Ended December 31, 2017\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 7,296\n$ 18,841\n$ (266)\n$ (5,887)\n$ (5,392)\nSubtract:\nStock-based compensation\n5,213\n516\n255\n-\n4,442\nDepreciation and amortization\n2,140\n1,740\n72\n327\n1\nWrite-off of capitalized exploration costs\n6,483\n-\n-\n6,483\n-\n(Loss) income from operations\n(6,540)\n$ 16,585\n$ (593)\n$( 12,697)\n$ (9,835)\nInterest income\n295\nInterest expense\n(310)\nOther expense, net\n(367)\nProvision for income taxes\n(1,726)\nNet loss\n(8,648)\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\n1,654\nNet loss attributable to Genie Energy Ltd.\n$ (6,994)\nTotal\nGenie\nRetail\nEnergy\nGOGAS\nAfek\nCorporate\nYear Ended December 31, 2016\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 14,724\n$ 27,350\n$ (758)\n$ (7,043)\n$ (4,825)\nSubtract (Add):\nStock-based compensation\n4,813\n420\n36\n-\n4,357\nDepreciation and amortization\n581\n427\n30\n124\n-\nWrite-off of capitalized exploration costs\n41,041\n-\n-\n41,041\n-\nOther operating loss, net\n64\n-\n-\n64\n-\nGain on consolidation of AMSO, LLC\n(1,262)\n-\n(1,262)\n-\n-\n(Loss) income from operations\n(30,513)\n$ 26,503\n$ 438\n$ (48,272)\n$ (9,182)\nInterest income\n332\nInterest expense\n(19)\nOther income, net\n226\nProvision for income taxes\n(2,218)\nNet loss\n(32,192)\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\n7,667\nNet loss attributable to Genie Energy Ltd.\n$ (24,525)\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/genie-energy-ltd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300610543.html\nSOURCE Genie Energy Ltd.",
