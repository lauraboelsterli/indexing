    "text": "NEW YORK, March 7 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley’s top executive said on Wednesday that potential tariffs on steel and aluminum that President Donald Trump is to expected to formally sign off on later this week are a “bad idea.”\nThe “biggest issues this country faces are not trade deficits, they’re fiscal deficits,” Chief Executive Officer James Gorman told CNBC, adding that he was “not a fan” of tariffs.\nGorman added that he is not looking to hire Gary Cohn, a top economic adviser to Trump, who plans to resign. Cohn was formerly president and chief operating officer at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (Reporting by Catherine Ngai; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)\n ",
