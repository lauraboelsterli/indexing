    "text": "- Delivered a fourth quarter comparable sales increase of 5.7% -\n- Expanded gross margin rate in the fourth quarter by 240 basis points -\n- Reduced SG&A as a percent of net sales by 730 basis points in the fourth quarter -\nMINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Christopher & Banks Corporation (NYSE:CBK), a specialty women’s apparel retailer, today reported results for the 14-week fourth quarter and 53-week fiscal year ended February 3, 2018, as compared to the 13-week fourth quarter and 52-week year ended January 28, 2017.\nResults for the Fourteen Weeks Ended February 3, 2018\nNet sales totaled $92.3 million, an increase of 8.6%, compared to net sales of $85.0 million in the fourth quarter last year, while operating an average of 6% fewer stores as compared to the same period last year. Net sales attributable to the 14 th week totaled $5.0 million. Comparable sales increased 5.7% on a 14-week basis following a 7.8% decrease in the same period last year. This included eCommerce sales growth of 11.6% following a 7.5% increase in the same period last year. Gross margin was 27.2% compared to 24.8% in the same period last year. The 240 basis point increase reflects an improved merchandise margin rate, primarily due to lower markdowns, and the effect of sales leverage on occupancy costs. Selling, general & administrative expenses (“SG&A”) decreased by $3.7 million. As a percent of net sales, SG&A was 34.1%, compared to 41.4% in the prior year period. Net loss totaled $8.8 million, or $(0.23) per share, compared to a net loss for the prior year period of $17.2 million, or $(0.46) per share. This includes a net loss of approximately $0.3 million, or $(0.01) per share, from the 14 th week. Adjusted EBITDA * , a non-GAAP measure, was $(6.3) million, compared to $(14.1) million for the same period last year. This includes EBITDA of approximately $(0.3) million from the 14 th week.\nJoel Waller, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We ended the year on a strong note, illustrating the significant progress that we have made across a number of strategic initiatives. We took steps centered around merchandising, marketing, eCommerce, and store operations to stabilize the business and position us to drive more consistent financial performance. For the fourth quarter, we delivered strong comparable sales growth and expanded gross margin, and ended the year with a well-balanced assortment in terms of fashion content, size ranges and newness. We look forward to working with Keri Jones, our recently appointed Chief Executive Officer, as we continue to leverage the strong foundation we have established to drive sustainable long-term growth.”\nResults for the Fifty-Three Weeks Ended February 3, 2018\nNet sales totaled $365.9 million, a decrease of 4.1%, compared to net sales of $381.6 million last year, while operating on average 6.4% fewer stores. Net sales attributable to the 53rd week totaled $5.0 million. Comparable sales decreased 2.5% for the 53-week period as compared to the same period last year. Net loss for fiscal 2017 totaled $22.0 million, or $(0.59) per share. Net loss for fiscal 2016 totaled $17.8 million, or $(0.48) per share. This includes a net loss of approximately $0.3 million, or $(0.01) per share, from the 53rd week. Adjusted EBITDA*, a non-GAAP measure, was $(9.4) million, compared to $(3.4) million for the same period last year. This includes EBITDA of approximately $(0.3) million from the 53rd week.\nBalance Sheet Highlights and Capital Expenditures\nCash and cash-equivalents totaled $23.1 million as of February 3, 2018. Total inventory was $41.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter as compared to $36.8 million at the end of the fourth quarter last year, an increase of 12%. At fiscal year-end approximately 55% of the inventory was less than 60 days old compared to approximately 40% at the end of last year. On a two-year basis, inventory was approximately flat at the end of the quarter. The Company returned to a more normalized and healthy inventory level at the end of fiscal 2017, following a sharp decline at the end of fiscal 2016. Inventory at the end of the quarter would have been up 6% on a 52-week calendar.\nCapital expenditures for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 were $0.7 million compared to $1.6 million in last year’s fourth quarter. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter this year primarily reflected investments in stores and technology associated with the Company’s omni-channel capabilities. For the fourth quarter ended February 3, 2018, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility.\nAs previously discussed, the Company continues to pursue a potential sale and leaseback of its corporate facility and will provide updates on the process as warranted.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), this press release contains non-GAAP financial measures, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted loss per share. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered superior to or as a substitute for net income or net loss, or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes the inclusion of these non-GAAP measures provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding the underlying performance of the Company’s business operations, especially when comparing such results to previous periods. These non-GAAP measures are not an alternative for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure as provided in the tables below.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as Net income (loss), adjusted for Income tax provision (benefit); Other income; Interest expense, net; Depreciation and Amortization; Impairment of long-lived assets; and certain discretionary items. Please see “Non-GAAP Measures” above and the reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure that follows in the table below.\nAdjusted loss per share is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company defines adjusted loss per share as GAAP loss per share adjusted for certain discretionary items as outlined in the reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure that follows in the table below.\nConference Call Information\nThe Company will discuss its fourth quarter and full-year results in a conference call scheduled for today, March 8, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.
