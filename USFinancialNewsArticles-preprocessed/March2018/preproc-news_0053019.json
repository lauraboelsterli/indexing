    "text": "March 27, 2018 / 10:10 PM / Updated an hour ago Mitrovic double gives Serbia 2-0 friendly win over Nigeria Reuters Staff 2 Min Read LONDON (Reuters) - Serbia striker Aleksandar Mitrovic scored a second-half double to earn a 2-0 World Cup warm-up win over Nigeria in a lively encounter in London on Tuesday. Soccer Football - International Friendly - Nigeria vs Serbia - The Hive Stadium, London, Britain - March 27, 2018 Serbia's Matija Nastasic in action with Nigeria's Odion Ighalo Action Images via Reuters/Peter Cziborra It was a much improved performance by the Serbians after Friday’s 2-1 defeat by Morocco, while Nigeria put in a turgid display following a 1-0 win over Poland as the teams continue their preparations for this year’s finals in Russia. Newcastle United’s Mitrovic, on loan at promotion-chasing English Championship side Fulham, was unlucky in the early stages after television replays suggested his header which squeezed under keeper Francis Uzoho had crossed the line. Uzoho was much busier than his Serbia counterpart Vladimir Stojkovic, having parried stinging shots by Mitrovic and Branislav Ivanovic while he also stopped winger Dusan Tadic scoring with an easy chance. Slideshow (4 Images) Mitrovic missed another opportunity shortly after the interval before he finally broke the deadlock, superbly turning in a Filip Kostic cross from the left in the 68th minute. The two combined again 13 minutes later as Tadic released Kostic on the left with neat footwork and the forward squared the ball back for Mitrovic to sidefoot home from 10 metres. Halftime substitute Odion Ighalo missed Nigeria’s solitary chance in the second half when Stojkovic pushed his close-range shot over the bar at Barnet’s stadium. Serbia will face Costa Rica, Switzerland and Brazil in Group E when the World Cup gets underway in June, while Nigeria have been drawn with Croatia, Iceland and Argentina in Group D.
