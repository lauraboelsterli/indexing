    "text": "KIEV (Reuters) - The European Union’s foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said on Monday there was “no fatigue” on the part of the EU towards Ukraine, as demonstrated by its extension of sanctions on Russia and financial aid for Kiev.\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko (R) and European Union Foreign Policy Chief Federica Mogherini attend a news briefing after the talks in Kiev, Ukraine March 12, 2018. REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko On a visit to Ukraine, Mogherini signaled strong support but also urged authorities to do more to fight corruption and to set up an anti-corruption court in line with the recommendations of the Venice Commission, a rights watchdog.\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko, addressing a business forum later, expressed confidence a compromise could be found over the anti-corruption court that would satisfy both the Venice Commission and be in line with Ukrainian law.\nMogherini said Ukraine had made impressive progress on key reforms but more was needed.\nThe EU aims to disburse the first tranche of a new assistance package worth 1 billion euros ($1.23 billion) to Ukraine before the end of the year but the conditions of that aid are yet to be discussed, she said.\n“There is no fatigue in our support for Ukraine, also because we have seen results,” Mogherini said at a press briefing with Poroshenko.\nThe West threw its backing behind Ukraine after the 2013/2014 Maidan protests brought a pro-Western government to power, but since then critics have accused Poroshenko and the government of dragging their feet over reforms.\nUkrainian President Petro Poroshenko (R) speaks with European Union Foreign Policy Chief Federica Mogherini during a meeting in Kiev, Ukraine March 12, 2018. Mikhail Palinchak/Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Handout via REUTERS That has given rise to talk of “Ukraine fatigue” to reflect frustration at the slow pace of change.\nThe wrangling over the anti-corruption court law is a case in point.\nSlideshow (4 Images) Ukraine must pass the law in order to qualify for more aid from the International Monetary Fund, but the Fund has expressed “serious concern” that the legislation’s current draft form will not guarantee the new court’s independence.\nThe law was passed on its first reading in March.\nPoroshenko said the final “text of the bill will comply with the recommendations of the Venice Commission, Ukrainian legislation and the Constitution.”\nWhile Mogherini was in Kiev on Monday, the European Union announced the extension for another six months of its sanctions against Russia, imposed over the annexation of Crimea and support for rebels in eastern Ukraine.\nSpeaking alongside Mogherini, Poroshenko urged European Union countries to supply defensive weapons to Ukraine, following in the footsteps of U.S. President Donald Trump.\nWriting by Matthias Williams; editing by Andrew Roche\n ",
