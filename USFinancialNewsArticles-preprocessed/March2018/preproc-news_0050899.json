    "text": "March 27 (Reuters) - British apparel retailer and tailoring services provider Moss Bros Group Plc on Tuesday reported a drop in annual profit due on tough retail environment and supply issues and said retail comparable sales in the start of the new financial year also declined.\nThe groupâ€™s profit before tax fell 6.1 percent to 6.7 million pounds ($9.5 million) for the year ended Jan. 27, hurt by significant stock shortages and poor implementation of a project to consolidate suppliers, it said.\nRetail like-for-like sales were down 6.7 percent in the first eight weeks of the new financial year, the retailer said. ($1 = 0.7023 pounds) (Reporting by Rahul B in Bengaluru; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri)\n ",
