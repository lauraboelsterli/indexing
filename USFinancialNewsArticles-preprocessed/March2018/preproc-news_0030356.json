    "text": "March 16, 2018 / 2:58 PM / Updated 24 minutes ago In poison attack, EU's first focus not to boycott Russian World Cup - Merkel Reuters Staff 1 Min Read BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the immediate priority of European Union leaders discussing the nerve agent attack on a Russian ex-spy in Britain would not be to discuss a potential boycott of the soccer World Cup in Russia. German Chancellor Angela Merkel addresses a news conference after talks with Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven at the chancellery in Berlin, Germany, March 16, 2018. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke Ahead of an EU leadersâ€™ summit at which the poison attack will be discussed, Merkel said the focus of discussions would be the need to obtain clarity on what had happened in the attack, in which the spy, his daughter and a policeman were hurt. Her Swedish counterpart Stefan Lofven, speaking at the same joint press conference on Friday, said he agreed Russia needed to provide clarity regarding the attack.
