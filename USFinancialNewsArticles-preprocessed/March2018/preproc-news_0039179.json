In concert with the investments, SixThirty provides its portfolio companies with an eight-week business development and go-to-market program.\nAs part of the program, leaders from BNY Mellon's Pershing, Detalus, Enterprise Bank, and World Wide Technology will mentor SixThirty portfolio startups on topics ranging from sales, design, channel partnerships, vendor management due diligence, pricing, and technology, with each serving as a \"force multiplier\" of exposure. They join a growing group of SixThirty partners including UMB, Reinsurance Group of America (RGA) and State Farm. C-Level executives from these organizations join SixThirty's Investment Committee which evaluates the investment pipeline and selects FinTech startups to invest in.\nIn partnering with SixThirty, incumbents gain an understanding of emerging technology and business models in the FinTech space, while also having the opportunity to work side-by-side with the selected entrepreneurs for the SixThirty program.
