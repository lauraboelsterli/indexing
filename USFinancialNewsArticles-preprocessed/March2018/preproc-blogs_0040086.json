    "text": "Latvia: Latvia to ban shell companies in money laundering clampdown March 22nd, 2018 Europe \nLatvia will put forward legislation to ban shell companies, Prime Minister Maris Kucinskis said on Wednesday, after a chorus of demands from its Western allies that it clamp down on money laundering. \nLatvia is struggling to restore confidence in its financial institutions after U.S. accusations that the euro zone state’s third biggest bank, ABLV, was serving as a conduit for illicit funds. The bank, whose former management denies wrongdoing, was shut down last month. \n“We have agreed today about the prohibition of shell companies in Latvia,” Kucinskis told a news conference. If the legislation is passed in early April as the government plans, it could come into force in May, he said. \n  reuters.com",
