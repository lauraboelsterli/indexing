Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban (R) is seen at a football match with his childhood friend Lorinc Meszaros in Felcsut, Hungary April 21, 2014. REUTERS/Laszlo Balogh Companies owned or controlled by 10 businessmen - including   his son-in-law Istvan Tiborcz and his associates - have collectively secured 1.975 trillion forints ($7.85 billion) worth of tenders for contracts funded by public money since 2010, the analysis shows.   the period. The total includes contracts awarded either directly or in consortia, and direct contracts as well as framework agreements. The 10 men’s share of the total surged last year, when public procurement in Hungary reached a record high of 3.63 trillion forints. In 2017, companies they controlled won business worth 28 percent of that, up from around 1-2 percent before Orban took power. “Reuters’ analysis uncovered new hard data and arrived at a valid summary, which contribute to this field in a relevant way,” said Istvan Janos Toth, an economist with the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. Toth is also director of the Corruption Research Centre Budapest (CRCB). The analysis used data collected by the CRCB from the Public Procurement Agency’s website. Neither the government nor Orban responded to requests for comment. The 10 emerged during reporting for a special report from Lake Balaton, one of central Europe’s top tourist destinations. After Orban announced major public funding for tourism projects in the region in 2014, the men bought into properties in the Balaton city of Keszthely. Orban’s son-in-law Tiborcz was the first new investor. He pulled out of one property in 2015 after controversy around his purchase, but a company he co-owns now holds a stake in the resort’s largest hotel. This company, Reuters found, is entitled to 45 percent of profits from the hotel and another in its portfolio. He did not respond to a request for comment. EUROPEAN FUNDS Orban, whose party, Fidesz, faces elections on April 8, has made strengthening local businessmen a cornerstone of his economic policy. Polls show the premier, 54, is likely to secure a third straight term in office, although a united opposition has made his campaign less predictable. The Balaton investment will include European Union funds.   findings.
