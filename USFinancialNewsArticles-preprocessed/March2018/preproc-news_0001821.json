    "text": "LAKE FOREST, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Liquidmetal® Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: LQMT) , the leading developer of amorphous alloys and composites, reported results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nManagement Commentary\n“We made excellent progress in 2017 toward establishing global manufacturing operations for our revolutionary technology,” said Bruce Bromage, the Company’s Chief Operating Officer. “We made significant investments to commercialize our technologies and commission scalable manufacturing facilities. At the same time, we developed our markets through customer prototypes, and streamlined operations with reduced overhead costs. We are sharpening our cost models to reflect lower costs for higher volume materials and production to ensure competitive responses to RFQs as part of our manufacturing business model.”\nDr. Bromage continued, “Our focus this year is to bring Medical and Automotive development projects into production. We are encouraged by high levels of customer interest in our newer industrial amorphous metal molding and metal injection molding operations, which typically have shorter product development timelines. Fielding production parts is likely a demand-catalyst for customers investing in new technologies. Once initial products are introduced, the Company is prepared to scale rapidly.”\n2017 Financial Summary\nIn 2017, the Company generated $321 thousand in revenue as it continued to focus on the development and manufacturing of prototype and commercial parts for its customers and partnering with licensees on the development of the Company’s technology and production processes.\nCost of sales was $696 thousand compared to $553 thousand in 2016. The increase was primarily due to non-cash write-downs of raw material inventory following a change in the Company’s pricing strategy to further grow a sales pipeline.\nSelling, marketing, general and administrative expense was $6.3 million compared to $7.5 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to reductions in overall headcount, and associated salary expense, as well as a full reduction in short-term incentive compensation.\nResearch and development expense was $2.0 million compared to $2.3 million in 2016. The decrease from the prior year was mainly due to a full reduction in short-term incentive compensation and a lower volume of development projects in 2017.\nCash and restricted cash totaled $41.3 million at December 31, 2017, as compared to $58.9 million at December 31, 2016. The current year decrease was primarily due to capital investments in the build-out of the Company’s new manufacturing facility and the overall expansion of operations.\nAbout Liquidmetal Technologies\nLake Forest, California-based Liquidmetal Technologies, Inc. is the leading producer of parts made with amorphous alloys, also known scientifically as Bulk Metallic Glasses or BMGs. The non-crystalline atomic structure of these materials imparts unique performance properties, including the ability to injection-mold with micron-level precision, lustrous finishes, high strength, hardness and corrosion resistance, and remarkable elasticity. Liquidmetal Technologies is the first company to produce amorphous alloy parts commercially, enabling significant improvements in products across a wide array of industries.

These statements are based on current expectations of future events. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from Liquidmetal's expectations and projections. Risks and uncertainties include, among other things; customer adoption of Liquidmetal's technologies and successful integration of those technologies into customer products; potential difficulties or delays in manufacturing products incorporating Liquidmetal's technologies; Liquidmetal's ability to fund its current and anticipated operations; the ability of third party suppliers and manufacturers to meet customer product requirements; general industry conditions; general economic conditions; and governmental laws and regulations affecting Liquidmetal's operations. Additional information concerning these and other risk factors can be found in Liquidmetal's public periodic filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including the discussion under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in Liquidmetal's 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLIQUIDMETAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC.
