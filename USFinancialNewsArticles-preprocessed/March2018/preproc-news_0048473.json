Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop speak to the media during a news conference at Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, March 27, 2018.

In total, 100 diplomats are being removed, the biggest Western expulsion since the height of the Cold War. \nBishop said she thought Australia had taken “appropriate action” with the removal of the two Russian diplomats. \n“This sends a very powerful message that Russia’s actions and the responsibility that Russia must take this use of a chemical nerve agent in London will not be tolerated,” she said. \nFootball Federation Australia said on Tuesday that, as far as it was concerned, their Socceroos team would be in Russia in June.”As things stand, all qualifying teams, including the England team, will be taking part in this FIFA event and that continues to be our intention,” read an FFA statement.
