Lehtikuva/Martti Kainulainen/via REUTERS \nIn the most sweeping action of its kind against Moscow since the height of the Cold War, the United States and European Union member states plan to expel scores of Russian diplomats to punish the Kremlin for a nerve agent attack on a former double agent and his daughter in England. \nRussia, which denies any part in the March 4 attack, says the West’s action is a “provocative gesture” and has said it will respond.
