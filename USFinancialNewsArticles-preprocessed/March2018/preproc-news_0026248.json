    "text": "LAS VEGAS, March 15, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MGM Growth Properties LLC (\"MGP\") (NYSE:MGP) today announced that MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP declared a cash distribution to all unit holders of record, including MGP, on March 30, 2018 of $0.42 per unit for the first quarter (which represents a dividend of $1.68 on an annualized basis). Simultaneously, MGP's board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.42 per Class A common share for the first quarter. The dividends will be payable on April 13, 2018 to unit holders and shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 30, 2018, as applicable.\nAbout MGM Growth Properties LLC\nMGM Growth Properties LLC (NYSE:MGP) is one of the leading publicly traded real estate investment trusts engaged in the acquisition, ownership and leasing of large-scale destination entertainment and leisure resorts, whose diverse amenities include casino gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment and retail offerings. MGP currently owns a portfolio of properties acquired from MGM Resorts, consisting of ten premier destination resorts in Las Vegas and elsewhere across the United States and one dining and entertainment complex which opened in April 2016. As of December 31, 2017, these properties collectively comprise 27,541 hotel rooms, approximately 2.7 million convention square footage, over 100 retail outlets, over 200 food and beverage outlets and over 20 entertainment venues.
