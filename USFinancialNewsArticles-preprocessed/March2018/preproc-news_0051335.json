    "text": "DENVER, March 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- U.S. Energy Corp. (NASDAQ:USEG) (“U.S. Energy” or the “Company”) today announced financial and operational results for the year and fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017. In addition, the Company announced its estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2017.\nHighlights\n2017 Production of 186,676 BOE, or daily production of 511 BOEPD; 4Q2017 Production of 35,789 BOE, or daily production of 389 BOEPD; 2017 Oil and gas revenue of $6.6 million; 2017 Lease operating expenses of $2.4 million; Proved Developed Reserves of 824,115 BOE at December 31, 2017; SEC Pricing pre-tax PV-10 of $9.3 million at December 31, 2017; Cash and cash equivalents of $3.3 million at 12/31/2017; and Current shares outstanding of 12,440,927.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Transaction Highlights\nOn October 5, 2017, U.S. Energy divested certain Williston Basin non-operated assets in consideration for the elimination of $4.0 million in outstanding liabilities and payment to U.S. Energy of $2.0 million in cash. The divested assets had reserves of 607 BOE and a PV-10 of $5.2 million.\nOn December 29, 2017, U.S. Energy and APEG Energy II, L.P. (“APEG”) closed an exchange agreement pursuant to which APEG exchanged $4,463,380 of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility for 5,819,270 new shares of common stock of U.S. Energy. The closing of the transaction was approved by the Company’s shareholders on December 27, 2017.\nManagement Comment\nDavid Veltri, U.S. Energy’s Chief Executive Officer, stated, “2017 was a year of tremendous accomplishments for U.S. Energy. Through the refinancing of our credit facility and subsequent debt-for-equity exchange combined with the 4Q2017 asset divestiture, U.S. Energy has drastically improved its balance sheet and liquidity profile. The results of these efforts have finally begun to show up on our 2017 year-end financial statements and we expect to see continued improvements in both our operating margins and profitability going forward. We are pleased by the initial results targeting the Georgetown formation on our South Texas acreage position, and we will continue evaluating near term well participation opportunies on our acreage position in the area. Our growth targets for 2018 remain unchanged and with favorable commodity prices we feel confident about the future. We will look to continue to expand our acreage position in our existing, highly economic areas of North Dakota and South Texas while also looking to grow through significant acquisitions that will allow for a high return and focused development program.”\nFull Year and Fourth Quarter 2017 Production\n4 th Quarter 2017 Full Year 2017 Sales Volume (Total) Oil (Bbls) 16,875 111,914 Gas (Mcf) 113,469 448,571 Sales volumes (Boe) 35,789 186,676 Average Daily Production (Boe/d) 389 511 Average Sales Prices Oil (Bbl) $ 54.10 $ 45.16 Gas (Mcf) $ 3.14 $ 3.32 Barrel of Oil Equivalent $ 36.07 $ 35.06 Note: All production associated with the October 2017 asset divestiture is included until the October 3, 2017 closing date where all assets and associated production were transferred to buyer.\n2017 Year End Reserves\nAs of December 31, 2017, U.S. Energy had total proved reserves of approximately 824,115 Boe, all of which are proved developed producing reserves (“PDP”). The proved reserves total had a pre-tax PV10% value of $9.3 million.\nAs of 12/31/2017 As of 12/31/2016 Proved Developed Oil Reserves (Bbls) 676,030 657,280 Proved Undeveloped Oil Reserves (Bbls) - - Total Proved Oil Reserves (Bbls) 676,030 657,280 Proved Developed Gas Reserves (Mcf) 888,507 1,379,163 Proved Undeveloped Gas Reserves (Mcf) - - Total Proved Gas Reserves (Mcf) 888,507 1,379,163 Total Proved Reserves (Boe) 824,115 887,142 Present Value of Estimated Future Net Revenues Before Income Taxes, Discounted at 10% (In thousands)* $ 9,253 $\n6,747 *SEC pricing of $47.01/bbl of oil and $2.98/mcf of gas which includes adjustments for differentials\nOperations Update\nCML Beeler Ranch #1H: The CML Beeler Ranch #1H was spud in the fourth quarter 2017 and came on line in January 2018. The well is located in our Zavala county leasehold in South Texas and is a dual lateral with each lateral comprising approximately 10,000 feet of open hole completion within the Georgetown formation. The completion resulted in an initial 24-hour max IP rate of 1,046 barrels of oil and 1,085 mcf of natural gas and a 30-day average IP of 708 barrels of oil and 850 mcf of natural gas. U.S. Energy has an approximate 7% WI in this well. The total drill and complete cost of the well was $3.4 million. Additional wells are being planned in 2018 by the operator which could include our acreage and participation.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenues from sales of oil and natural gas during 2017 were $6.6 million compared to $5.7 million during 2016. The year over year increase in revenue is primarily due to the sustained increase in oil prices over the second half of 2017. Revenue from oil production represented 77% of Company revenue during 2017.\nLease operating expenses for 2017 were $2.4 million compared to $1.9 million for 2016. This increase was primarily attributed to workover costs associated with bringing producing wells back online due to improved economic returns driven by increased commodity prices.\nGeneral and administrative cash expenses for 2017 were $3.0 million compared to $2.7 million for 2016. The year over year increase is primarily associated with professional fees incurred during negotiations with our legacy credit facility lender over the first half of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA was ($0.3) million for 2017 as compared to $0.0 million for 2016. Net Loss was $1.4 million for 2017 compared to $14.1 million for 2016. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional information please refer to the reconciliation of this measure at the end of this news release.\nCredit Facility Update\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants and fully conforming with all requirements under its credit facility.\nCredit Facility Covenants Required Covenant Ratio U.S. Energy at 12/31/2017 Current Ratio Greater than 1.0 to 1.0 3.7 to 1.0 PDP to Secured Debt* Greater than 1.2 to 1.0 9.9 to 1.0 *Represents outstanding indebtedness of $0.9 million under the Credit Facility at 12/31/17.\n**U.S. Energy had a $0.6 million balance held under “current portion of long term debt” on the Company’s balance sheet at December 31, 2017 which was associated with the debt-for-equity exchange. This amount was paid in the first quarter of 2018.\nUpdate to Hedging Activity\nU.S. Energy hedges portions of its expected production volumes to increase the predictability of its cash flow and to help maintain a strong financial position. As of December 31, 2017, U.S. Energy had an unrealized loss on commodity price derivatives of $0.2 million.

Adjusted EBITDA consists of net earnings after adjustment for those items described in the table below. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent, and should not be considered an alternative to GAAP measurements, such as net income (loss) (its most directly comparable GAAP measure), and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. By eliminating the items described below, we believe the measure is useful in evaluating its fundamental core operating performance. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because similar measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies in similar industries. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA to manage our business, including in preparing our annual operating budget and financial projections. Our management does not view Adjusted EBITDA in isolation and also uses other measurements, such as net income (loss) and revenues to measure operating performance. The following table provides a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\n2017 2016 2015 Loss from continuing operations (GAAP) $ (1,360 ) $ (11,672 ) $ (67,284 ) Impairment of oil and gas properties - 9,568 57,676 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 753 2,529 8,412 (Gain)/loss on investments (777 ) (750 ) 68 Stock-based compensation 323 213 948 Employee severance costs - 3 504 (Gain)/loss on sale of assets 3 (102 ) (121 ) Gain on sale of oil and gas property (4,318 ) - - Loss on conversion of debt to equity 4,440 - - (Gain)/loss on warrant revaluation 170 (210 ) - Interest expense 513 442 263 Adjusted EBITDAX (Non-GAAP) $ (253 ) $ 21 $ 466 Corporate Contact: U.S. Energy Corp.
