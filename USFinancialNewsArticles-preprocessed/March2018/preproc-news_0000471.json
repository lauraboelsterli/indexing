The country’s biggest trucking group is pressing its call for more infrastructure spending by calling the fuel levy a user fee, hoping the shift in language triggers a change in heart among lawmakers who are adamantly opposed to raising the lever on road spending . The WSJ reports the effort is part of the growing push by highway groups to find the money to back President Donald Trump’s call for new investment in roads, bridges, ports and other infrastructure. The administration is looking to leverage $200 billion in federal money to lure in more than $1 trillion in spending from state and local governments, as well as private groups. Trucking companies want higher taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel because they worry the alternative would be more tolls, which truckers abhor. They face an uphill climb: The last time the gas tax was raised was 1993.\nMacy’s Inc.’s is finding that getting leaner is healthier in the tough retail market. The department store chain more than doubled its quarterly profit to $1.33 billion and, perhaps more important, boosted same-store sales by 1.3% while scaling back inventories. The 4.1% slice in merchandise inventories from a year ago helped Macy’s tamp down discount sales and steady a business that’s been roiled by big changes in the retail market . The WSJ’s Suzanne Kapner and Allison Prang write that the retailer’s own confidence is growing as consumer spending ramps up, and that Macy’s is now planning to boost capital spending 10% to $1 billion a year as it undertakes a makeover of its operations. That includes extending a retrenchment that’s seen it close 83 stores even as the company has added some outlets for targeted markets. Those sites will be smaller, and naturally will demand less inventory.\nAmazon.com Inc. is coming to your door. The e-commerce giant is acquired video-doorbell maker Ring in a deal valued at more than $1 billion, the WSJ’s Laura Stevens and Douglas MacMillan report, giving the company a bigger foothold in the home-security business and signaling it’s moving more aggressively to deliver packages into customers’ homes . More broadly, the deal plays to Amazon’s ambition to control the devices that power “smart” homes—devices that include its own Echo voice-based home assistant. The company last year launched its “Amazon Key” product, which allows its delivery drivers to deposit packages into customers’ homes via a security camera and smart lock system, and worked with other lock specialists in developing the service. Tying up with Amazon will give Ring accelerate its rapid growth in the home-security business, and it may end up bringing Amazon more security for its deliveries.\nTRANSPORTATION An electronic tolling gantry on the Massachusetts Turnpike. Photo: ABBY CAMPBELL/EPA/Shutterstock A court ruling on diesel cars in Germany could echo across automotive supply chains far beyond the country. In a landmark decision, a federal court ruled that two German cities can ban diesel vehicles from their streets as a way to reduce pollution, the WSJ’s William Boston reports, potentially paving the way for similar measures across Europe. The ruling is likely to accelerate the demise of a technology that German auto makers have long promoted as combining solid driving performance with fuel economy and low greenhouse-gas emissions. Those benefits have been largely discredited in the wake of emissions-cheating scandals at Volkswagen and other car makers. Auto supplier Delphi Technologies LLC has already dramatically scaled back its diesel business, and says the ruling will push manufacturers to move faster to move toward gasoline engines as well as electric cars and hybrids.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ We haven’t had an increase in the gas tax in a long time.
