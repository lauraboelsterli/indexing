    "text": "The world's first flying car that you can buy has been unveiled at the Geneva International Motor Show in Switzerland.\nDutch firm PAL-V revealed its final production model Tuesday and is now taking pre-orders for the car/aircraft on its website.\nPAL-V said the first delivery will be made in 2019 once the production model has received final safety certifications.\nSource: PAL-V The firm claims the two-person vehicle has a top road speed of about 100 miles per hour (mph) while it can reach 112 mph in the air. With a maximum altitude of 11,000 feet, the air range is estimated to top out at around 350 miles.\nTransforming from road to air isn't quite as simple as pushing a button, requiring manual intervention, but Pal-V claims this can be done in less than 10 minutes.\nThe first limited edition model will retail at an expected 499,000 euros ($621,500) with only 90 available for sale. Thereafter a \"Liberty Sport Edition\" will be available for an expected price of 299,000 euros.\nFlying lessons are included in the price and the company's website is taking orders tied to hefty non-refundable reservation fees.\nThe flying car is certified to fly under the rules of U.S. and European safety agencies but owners will need a pilot's licence. Pilots will also need access to a small airstrip to take off and land.\nDavid Reid Digital Correspondent, CNBC.com ",
