With about half of the 25 Air Berlin aircraft now rebranded with the easyJet livery, Lundgren said other acquisitions could follow in the future.\n“Yes,” he said when asked if there would be further acquisitions.\n“We have an investment grade balance sheet...I’m a firm believer there will be more acquisitions in the industry.”\nHe said easyJet remained interested in acquiring the short-haul operations of Alitalia, the ailing Italian flag carrier, and was in talks with its commissioners.\nWhen asked about the transition deal agreed for Britain’s exit from the European Union, he said easyJet welcomed the clarity it brought, for itself and for businesses and that he was confident there would be a deal on aviation for the period after Brexit.\nLundgren, the Swedish former deputy CEO at travel company TUI, replaced Carolyn McCall as easyJet CEO in December 2017.\nAsked about bigger rival Ryanair’s move earlier in March to flying both Boeing planes and Airbus jets after an acquisition, Lundgren said easyJet was happy with its Airbus-only fleet at the moment.\nOn Tuesday, easyJet added seven new airports to “Worldwide by easyJet” including Paris Charles De Gaulle, Berlin Tegel and Amsterdam Schiphol plus other airlines including Thomas Cook , with connections to the Caribbean and the United States, and Corsair, which flies to Indian Ocean destinations.\nPreviously connecting flights were only available on its Worldwide platform via London Gatwick.\nCurrently the most popular route using the Worldwide product is between Rome and Chicago, with travellers flying to Gatwick on easyJet, then onto Chicago with Norwegian. Tickets cost from about 150 pounds in total.\nReporting by Sarah Young; Additional reporting by Victoria Bryan; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ",
