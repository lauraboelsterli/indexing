    "text": "Nathan MacKinnon scored twice to boost his goal tally to a team-leading 31, and he added three assists as the Colorado Avalanche won their third consecutive game with a 7-1 rout of the Minnesota Wild on Friday night at the Pepsi Center in Denver.\nMacKinnon is the first Avalanche player to have multiple five-point games in a season since Paul Stastny did so twice in the 2007-08 campaign. MacKinnon also had five points (one goal, four assists) in a 6-2 win against the Washington Capitals on Nov. 16.\nGabriel Landeskog (21 goals), Mikko Rantanen (21), Matt Nieto (12), Carl Soderberg (12) and Tyson Barrie (8) each added a goal for the Avalanche, who matched a season high for goals and improved to 4-1-1 in their past six games.\nMikko Koivu (12 goals) collected the lone tally for Minnesota. The Wild, who took a 5-3 setback at Arizona on Thursday, lost their second straight following a season-high five-game winning streak.\nIt was the second consecutive meeting in which Minnesota allowed seven goals against Colorado after a 7-2 loss in Denver on Jan. 6. However, the Wild were 3-2 shootout winners in their first meeting of the season with the Avalanche on Nov. 24.\nSemyon Varlamov stopped 31 of 32 shots for Colorado. Minnesota goalie Devan Dubnyk allowed five goals on 17 shots before being pulled for backup Alex Stalock, who recorded seven saves on nine shots.\nLandeskog (at 9:42) and MacKinnon (12:08) each lit the lamp in the first period.\nThe Avalanche did their bulk of their damage during a four-goal second, with Barrie (at 5:54), MacKinnon (8:08), Soderberg (10:39) and Rantanen (12:40) all netting goals. Koivu’s goal with 2:53 to play in the second ensured the Wild wouldn’t go scoreless.\nNieto capped the scoring 7:46 into the third.\nThe teams wrap up their four-game season series on March 13 in Minnesota.\nBefore the game, the Avalanche signed defenseman Conor Timmins to a three-year, entry-level contract.\nColorado wraps up a four-game homestand Sunday versus the Nashville Predators. Minnesota begins a quick two-game homestand Sunday against the Detroit Red Wings.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
