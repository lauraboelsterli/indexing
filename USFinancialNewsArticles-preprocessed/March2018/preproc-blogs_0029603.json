    "text": "Joshua Roberts | Reuters Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC) \nRep. Trey Gowdy , R-S.C., on Tuesday contradicted his own GOP-led committee's findings in its probe of Russian meddling during the 2016 U.S. election. \nIn a statement, Gowdy said it was \"clear, based on the evidence, Russia had disdain for Secretary Clinton and was motivated in whole or in part by a desire to harm her candidacy or undermine her Presidency had she prevailed.\" \nThe statement from Gowdy, who is not seeking re-election at the end of his current term, cuts against conclusions announced Monday by the Republican-led House Intelligence Committee. \nChairman Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said on Monday that the committee, which has been active for more than a year, has finished conducting interviews as part of its investigation. In his statement, Nunes thanked Gowdy, as well as Republican Reps. Tom Rooney of Florida and Mike Conaway of Texas, \"for the excellent job they've done leading this investigation.\" \nBut Gowdy's Tuesday statement appeared to contradict the initial findings of his own investigation, which said it disagreed with the intelligence community's prior judgments \"with respect to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's supposed preference for candidate Trump.\" \nThe committee majority did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment on Gowdy's statement. \nRanking committee member Adam Schiff, D-Calif., excoriated his Republican colleagues for their \"capitulation\" to the executive branch\" on Monday and said his party will continue to investigate. Schiff tweet: BREAKING: GOP just shut down House Intel investigation, leaving questions unanswered, leads unexplored, countless witnesses uncalled, subpoenas unissued. If Russians have leverage over the President, GOP has decided that it would rather not know. The minority's work continues: \nThe intense polarization in the committee was ossified during a protracted duel over declassified memos earlier this year — a Republican memo alleging FBI surveillance abuses and a Democratic rebuttal defending the bureau's methods. \nGowdy, a former federal prosecutor, is the only Republican on the committee who read the underlying surveillance court documents from which the GOP memo was drawn. \nPresident Donald Trump celebrated the committee Republicans' initial findings in an all-caps tweet on Monday evening. \nThe initial report from the House committee also said it \"found no evidence of collusion, coordination, or conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians,\" a statement Gowdy echoed on Tuesday. \n\"No witness provided evidence — direct or circumstantial — of collusion, coordination or conspiracy,\" Gowdy said. \nHowever, Gowdy said Russia's attempts to divide Americans are \"crystal clear.\" \n\"Russia's ultimate goal was to turn Americans against Americans, undercut our confidence in the electoral process, and sow the seeds of discord,\" he said. \"On that measure, we are in direct control — as Americans — of whether they succeed or not.\"",
