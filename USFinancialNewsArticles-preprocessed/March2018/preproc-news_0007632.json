    "text": "Center Shaquille Morris scored 19 points and guard Conner Frankamp added 16 as No. 11 Wichita State stretched its winning streak to seven with a 75-71 overtime victory over UCF Thursday night in Orlando.\nThe Shockers (24-5, 14-3 American Athletic Conference) missed key free throws in the closing minutes of regulation but made three — two by guard Landry Shamet and one by Austin Reaves — in the final 19 seconds of the extra period to seal the win.\nThe Knights (17-12, 8-9) got a double-double from senior forward A.J. Davis, who had a career-high 31 points and 14 rebounds, and 23 from guard B.J. Taylor, but lost their third in a row.\nDavis picked up a loose ball in a scramble for a rebound and banked in a 3-pointer with 0.8 seconds left to send the game into overtime at 68-all.\nThe Knights, who had lost a 49-44 lead with just over 13 minutes left in regulation, overcame a 64-55 deficit over the final four minutes of the second half and got the chance to tie when Wichita forward Markis McDuffie missed the first of a one-and-one free throw opportunity with 16.9 seconds left and the Shockers up by three.\nThe games was a series of runs with Wichita going on a 8-0 spurt after falling behind 49-44 in the first seven minutes of the second half and then UCF responding with its 10-1 surge at the end.\nEarlier, the Knights went on a 14-0 run to assume a 22-8 lead approaching the 12-minute mark of the first half, but the rest of the period belonged to the Shockers.\nMcDuffie’s layup ended Wichita’s scoring drought, and the Shockers outscored the Knights 25-7 the rest of the way to assume a 36-29 lead at the break. The Knights failed to make a field goal for nearly the last eight minutes of the half, missing all seven of their field goal attempts over the span.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
