Bender Louise Radnofsky \nWASHINGTON—The U.S. Justice Department has submitted a regulation to ban devices that allow certain firearms to fire as rapidly as machine guns, making so-called bump stocks illegal to own or sell. \nThe proposed ban represents the first action from the executive branch on guns since President Donald Trump said last year that he wanted to make school safety the White House’s priority. \n“President Trump is absolutely committed to ensuring the safety and security of every American and he has directed us to propose a regulation addressing bump stocks,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement Saturday. \nThe regulation would amend the definition of machine guns in the National Firearms and Gun Control Act to include bump stock-type devices, Mr. Sessions said. The Justice Department said the regulation must undergo review by the federal Office of Management and Budget before it can take effect. \nThe move comes in the wake of the mass shooting last month at a Florida high school that left 17 people dead. Bump stocks became part of the national conversation over gun control for the first time last year, when the devices were found among the weapons used in the Las Vegas shooting that killed 58 people Oct. 1.
