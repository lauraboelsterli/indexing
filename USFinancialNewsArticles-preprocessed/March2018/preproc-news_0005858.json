AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO RECONCILIATION OF GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(Unaudited)\nThe “Adjusted Financial Information” provided in the attached reflects the following non-GAAP financial measures:\nFiscal 2017\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, adjusted results exclude the following:\nA $45.0 million pre-tax loss ($28.8 million net of tax of $16.2 million), included in other income (loss), associated with the early extinguishment of our June 2019 notes. A $92.2 million tax benefit related to changes in U.S. tax legislation.\nIn the first, second and third quarters of 2017, there were no adjustments to results.\nFiscal 2016\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, adjusted results exclude the following:\nA $41.7 million tax benefit related to the favorable resolution of a discrete income tax matter.\nIn the third quarter of 2016, there were no adjustments to results.\nIn the second quarter of 2016, adjusted results exclude the following:\nA $108.3 million pre-tax gain ($70.2 million net of tax of $38.1 million), included in other income (loss), related to a $124.4 million cash distribution from Easton Town Center. A $35.8 million pre-tax loss ($22.4 million net of tax of $13.4 million), included in other income (loss), associated with the early extinguishment of our July 2017 notes.\nIn the first quarter of 2016, adjusted results exclude the following:\nPre-tax charges of $34.5 million ($21.4 million net of tax of $13.1 million) related to actions at Victoria’s Secret, including severance charges, fabric cancellations and the write-off of catalogue paper.\nThe Adjusted Financial Information should not be construed as an alternative to the reported results determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Further, the Company’s definition of adjusted income information may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies. Management believes that the presentation of adjusted financial information provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations. While it is not possible to predict future results, management believes the adjusted information is useful for the assessment of the ongoing operations of the Company because the adjusted items are not indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and nature. Additionally, management uses adjusted financial information as key performance measures of results of operations for the purpose of evaluating performance internally. The Adjusted Financial Information should be read in conjunction with the Company’s historical financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual report on Form 10-K.\nSource:L Brands, Inc.",
