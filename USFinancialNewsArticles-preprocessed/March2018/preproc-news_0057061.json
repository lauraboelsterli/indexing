    "text": "March 30, 2018 / 2:55 AM / Updated 6 hours ago Rugby-Wasps' Jones forced to retire at 26 due to judo training injury   \nMarch 30 (Reuters) - Wasps flanker Sam Jones has been forced to retire from rugby after failing to recover fully from an injury sustained during a judo session at an England training camp, the Premiership club has announced. \nThe 26-year-old suffered a dislocated ankle, fractured fibular bone, ruptured ligaments and damaged cartilage while grappling with Maro Itoje while on England duty in 2016. \nJones has not played a first-team match since and has heeded medical advice to quit the game. \n“Unfortunately, the injury was a complicated one and my rehab wasn’t progressing the way we wanted, with multiple set-backs along the way,” Jones said in a statement. \n“The decision was made for me, which was tough to hear. But it’s a decision that I understand is in my best interests.” \nJones made 118 appearances for Wasps after coming through the club’s academy, making his senior debut in 2010. \nHe picked up the injury while preparing for the autumn internationals, where he was expected to make his England debut. \n“For me, getting selected for England based on my club form was a huge achievement and I’m proud that was my last contribution to the game,” Jones added.
