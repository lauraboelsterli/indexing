    "text": "March 17, 2018 / 11:23 PM / a day ago Golf-Stenson grabs one-shot lead at Bay Hill, Woods five back Reuters Staff 2 Min Read March 17 (Reuters) - Henrik Stenson held a one-stroke lead over Bryson DeChambeau with big names Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose and Rickie Fowler pushing into contention and Tiger Woods five shots back after the third round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational on Saturday. Swede Stenson, despite three bogeys, stayed atop the leaderboard at 12-under 204 after shooting a one-under 71 at Bay Hill on a gorgeous Florida afternoon. Woods, an eight time winner, birdied the 18th for a 69 and a share of 10th at 209. “That was a nice one,” the former world number one said of the birdie. “Maybe a low (score) tomorrow will give me a chance to kind of steal one.” He will need to overcome some of the world’s top players. While DeChambeau, the second-round co-leader, hung on for second with a 72, McIlroy, Rose and Fowler are all well placed. Northern Irishman McIlroy, playing his best golf in the United States this year, was strong on a back nine which featured an eagle at the 12th. He finished the day outright third at 10-under after a round of 67. Englishman Rose (67) and American Ryan Moore (69) were a stroke back on eight-under in a group including Fowler, who managed a 70 despite dropping three strokes in a meltdown on the last two holes.
