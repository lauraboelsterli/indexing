    "text": "BRASILIA, March 2 (Reuters) - A potential hike in U.S. tariffs would be“manageable” for Brazilian steel producers and would not have a“meaningful impact” on the larger steel companies, Moody’s Investors Service said on Friday in a note to clients.\nBrazil’s largest flat steelmaker, Usiminas, exports only 15 percent of its output and only a negligible part goes to the U.S. market. The second-largest company CSN exports just 5 percent of its steel, Moodys said.\nTariffs could, in fact, favor Gerdau SA because it has significant operations in the United States, Moody’s said.
