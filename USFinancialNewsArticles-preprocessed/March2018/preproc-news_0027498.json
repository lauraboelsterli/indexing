    "text": "Updated 3 Mins Ago CNBC.com \nA newly-installed pedestrian bridge at Florida International University in Miami collapsed on Thursday afternoon, killing several people, Florida Highway Patrol officials told local NBC News affiliate WTVJ . \nEight cars were trapped under the bridge, said Miami-Dade fire officials at a press conference. Eight victims have been transferred to the hospital, with \"a lot of serious injuries,\" Miami-Dade police officials said. \nFire department and police department officials did not confirm any fatalities and said search and rescue efforts would continue with over 100 technicians on site. \nThe 950-ton span fell at the university's main Miami-area campus after being installed on Saturday. Source: WTVJ Bridge collapse at Florida International University, March 15, 2018. \nFlorida International University released a statement, saying \"w e are shocked and saddened about the tragic events unfolding at the FIU-Sweetwater pedestrian bridge. At this time we are still involved in rescue efforts and gathering information. We are working closely with authorities and first responders on the scene.\" \nThe school is currently on spring break, so classes are not in session. \nThe White House said President Donald Trump is aware of the bridge collapse and is monitoring the situation. Florida Gov. Rick Scott tweeted that he will be in \"constant communication with law enforcement throughout the day.\" \nThe U.S. Department of Transportation issued a statement, saying Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has offered the \"full assistance and support of the Department for both the immediate and long-term needs the community will have.\" \nBilled as an \"instant bridge,\" the 30-foot-wide, 174-foot-long structure was lifted, rotated 90 degrees across an eight-lane thoroughfare and lowered into place by cranes on Saturday, according to an FIU press release . \nIt was set to open in early 2019 to allow students on bike and foot to cross the busy roadway safely. It was also supposed to serve as a study and gathering space. \nThe structure was built and designed by MCM Construction and FIGG Bridge Engineers. MCM Construction said on Twitter Thursday: \"Our family's thoughts and prayers go out to everyone affected by this terrible tragedy.\" \nThe bridge was built using Accelerated Bridge Construction methods, which reduce \"potential risks to workers, commuters and pedestrians and minimizes traffic interruptions,\" the FIU press release said. \n\"FIU is about building bridges and student safety. This project accomplishes our mission beautifully,\" said FIU President Mark B. Rosenberg in the release. \"We are filled with pride and satisfaction at seeing this engineering feat come to life and connect our campus to the surrounding community where thousands of our students live.\" \nThe $14.2 million bridge across Southwest 8th Street was partially funded by the Department of Transportation through a grant. \nThis story is developing.
