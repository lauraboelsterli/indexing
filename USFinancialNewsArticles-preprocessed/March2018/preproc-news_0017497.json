    "text": "WELLINGTON, Fla., March 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- KLX Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:KLXI), a leading distributor and value added service provider of aerospace fasteners and consumables, and a provider of services and products to the oil and gas exploration and production industry, today reported its fourth fiscal quarter and full fiscal year ended January 31, 2018 financial results.\nOn a GAAP basis, for the three-month period ended January 31, 2018, as compared to the three-month period ended January 31, 2017, revenues increased 18.4 percent to $442.2 million, while operating earnings increased 56.0 percent to $54.9 million. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company was required to revalue its deferred tax assets as result of recently enacted tax legislation. This revaluation resulted in a one-time non-cash tax charge of approximately $43 million. In addition, the Company incurred approximately $6.2 million of one-time costs primarily associated with the process being conducted by the Board to review strategic alternatives, the transition to the Aerospace Solutions Group’s new global distribution and operations center and a restructuring of the Eagle Ford Geo Region, which was the Energy Services Group’s only unprofitable region. The costs associated with the strategic alternatives review, the new facility transition and the restructuring of the Eagle Ford operations are collectively referred to as “Costs as Defined.” Including the charge associated with the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and Costs as Defined, GAAP net loss and net loss per diluted share were $(11.5) million and $(0.23) per diluted share, decreases of $29.4 million and $0.57 per diluted share, respectively. Excluding the non-cash charge associated with the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and Costs as Defined, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Net Earnings per diluted share were $50.1 million and $1.00 per diluted share, increases of 84.9 percent and 92.3 percent, respectively, as compared to the three-month period ended January 31, 2017. See \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nFOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS\nConsolidated revenue growth of 18.4 percent to $442.2 million Consolidated operating earnings of $54.9 million increased by 56.0 percent Consolidated Adjusted operating earnings of $61.1 million increased 69.7 percent Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Net Earnings per diluted share were $50.1 million and $1.00 per diluted share, respectively, representing increases of 84.9 percent and 92.3 percent, respectively Increased 2018 guidance by $0.50 per diluted share to $4.30 of Adjusted Net Earnings per diluted share to reflect the lower tax rate associated with the recent changes in tax legislation and a contribution from two product lines purchased immediately before the end of the fourth quarter\nWe have presented Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Net Earnings per diluted share to reflect net earnings before the non-cash charge associated with the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets, Costs as Defined, and amortization and non-cash compensation expense, and to include the tax benefit from the amortization of tax-deductible goodwill (“Adjusted Net Earnings” and “Adjusted Net Earnings per diluted share”). This release includes “Adjusted operating earnings,” “ASG Adjusted operating earnings” and “ESG Adjusted operating earnings,” which exclude Costs as Defined. This release also includes “Adjusted EBITDA,” “ASG Adjusted EBITDA” and “ESG Adjusted EBITDA” which exclude Costs as Defined and non-cash compensation expense, and “free cash flow.” Each of the aforementioned metrics are “non-GAAP financial measures” as defined in Regulation G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nFOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nOn a consolidated basis, revenues increased 18.4 percent to $442.2 million, driven by an approximate 5.5 percent increase in Aerospace Solutions Group (“ASG”) revenues and an approximate 116.1 percent increase in Energy Services Group (“ESG”) revenues. On a GAAP basis, operating earnings and operating margin of $54.9 million and 12.4 percent increased by 56.0 percent and approximately 300 basis points, respectively. Adjusted operating earnings and Adjusted operating margin were $61.1 million and 13.8 percent, respectively, reflecting an approximate 60 basis point increase in ASG’s Adjusted operating margin and continued strong year-over-year improvement at ESG. Excluding the non-cash revaluation charge and Costs as Defined, Adjusted Net Earnings and Adjusted Net Earnings per diluted share increased 84.9 percent and 92.3 percent to $50.1 million and $1.00 per diluted share, respectively.\n“We are pleased to report a significant increase in both consolidated revenues and operating earnings in the fourth quarter, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Our ASG segment delivered solid revenue growth driven by a mid-single digit percentage increase in both commercial aerospace manufacturing and aftermarket revenues,” said Amin J. Khoury, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of KLX.\n“In the fourth quarter, ASG successfully completed the implementation of our new warehouse management system at our Phoenix, Arizona facility, which will now be rolled out to our other major worldwide stocking locations. In addition, the build-out of ASG’s new global distribution and operations center in Miami has been completed, and we will begin to move administrative teams into the new facility in the first quarter, with the transfer and consolidation of inventory currently held in the three legacy facilities in Miami taking place through the remainder of 2018. Together, the new global distribution and operations center, which incorporates our new warehouse automation technology, and our new warehouse management system will greatly enhance future customer service, while supporting substantial productivity gains and margin improvements, as well as more efficient inventory management that is expected to improve free cash flow. Additionally, immediately before the end of the fourth quarter, KLX acquired two new product lines. The first purchase includes high performance fasteners and precision components and assemblies dedicated to aircraft engine manufacturing. The second group of products will enable us to offer our customers technical products, systems and expertise in motion and control applications, including hydraulics, pneumatics, fluid connectors, filtration, electrical control systems, seals, compressors and engineered systems for both OEM and aftermarket applications. The total purchase price for these new product lines was approximately $65 million,” Mr. Khoury stated.\nMr. Khoury continued, “Our ESG segment once again delivered strong improvements in operating performance on a quarter-over-quarter basis, including positive Adjusted operating earnings for the first time since the fourth quarter of 2014, and a 35.1 percent increase in Adjusted EBITDA compared to the third quarter, reflecting the substantial earnings leverage inherent in the business.”\nFOURTH QUARTER SEGMENT RESULTS\nThe following is a tabular summary and commentary of revenues, Adjusted operating earnings and Adjusted EBITDA, for the three month periods ended January 31, 2018 and January 31, 2017 ($ millions):\nREVENUES THREE MONTHS ENDED Segment January 31, 2018 January 31, 2017 % Change Aerospace Solutions Group $ 348.0 $ 329.8 5.5 % Energy Services Group 94.2 43.6 116.1 % Total $ 442.2 $ 373.4 18.4 % OPERATING EARNINGS (LOSS) THREE MONTHS ENDED Segment January 31, 2018 January 31, 2017 % Change Aerospace Solutions Group $ 57.3 $ 54.1 5.9 % Energy Services Group (2.4 ) (18.9 ) 87.3 % Total $ 54.9 $ 35.2 56.0 % ADJUSTED OPERATING EARNINGS (LOSS) THREE MONTHS ENDED Segment January 31, 2018 January 31, 2017 % Change Aerospace Solutions Group $ 59.9 $ 54.9 9.1 % Energy Services Group 1.2 (18.9 ) nm Total $ 61.1 $ 36.0 69.7 % ADJUSTED EBITDA (LOSS) THREE MONTHS ENDED Segment January 31, 2018 January 31, 2017 % Change Aerospace Solutions Group $ 71.1 $ 65.5 8.5 % Energy Services Group 12.7 (7.7 ) nm Total $ 83.8 $ 57.8 45.0 % For the three months ended January 31, 2018, ASG revenues of $348.0 million increased approximately 5.5 percent compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in revenues was driven by an approximate 7 percent increase in sales to commercial aerospace manufacturing customers, partially offset by a double digit percentage decline in revenues from business jet manufacturing customers. Aftermarket revenues increased by approximately 5.3 percent as compared to the prior year, driven by a substantial increase in aircraft maintenance activity among MROs, repair shops and airlines. On a GAAP basis, ASG operating earnings of $57.3 million increased 5.9 percent, and operating margin of 16.5 percent expanded approximately 10 basis points. ASG’s Adjusted operating earnings were $59.9 million or 17.2 percent of revenues, up 9.1 percent and approximately 60 basis points, respectively, as compared to the same period in the prior year.

The Company generated free cash flow of $121.7 million, or approximately 227.9 percent of net earnings and 73.1 percent of Adjusted Net Earnings. Capital expenditures were $84.9 million, reflecting investments related to the Company’s new 550,000 square foot ASG Miami global distribution and operations center, and discrete investments within the ESG business. In addition, as previously discussed, immediately prior to the end of the fourth quarter the Company invested approximately $65 million to expand ASG’s product offerings. As of January 31, 2018, cash on hand was approximately $255 million.
