A senior U.S. official said later it could happen \"in a matter of a couple of months, with the exact timing and place still to be determined\".\nAsian stock markets responded positively to the news, with Japan's Nikkei climbing 2.3 percent. South Korean stocks were enjoying their best day since May, up 1.8 percent, while the dollar rose against the safe-haven Japanese yen .\nTrump had previously said he was willing to meet Kim under the right circumstances but had indicated the time was not right for such talks. He mocked U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in October for \"wasting his time\" trying to talk to North Korea.\nTillerson said earlier on Thursday during a visit to Africa that, although \"talks about talks\" might be possible with Pyongyang, denuclearisation negotiations were likely a long way off.\n'NO MISSILE TESTS'\n\"Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze,\" Trump said on Twitter on Thursday night. \"Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time. Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached.\"\nA meeting between Kim and Trump, who have exchanged insults that had  \n  Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama.\nSouth Koreans responded positively to the news, with online comments congratulating President Moon Jae-In for laying the groundwork for the Trump-Kim talks. Some even suggested Moon should receive the Nobel Peace award, although scepticism over previous failed talks remained.\nNorth and South Korea are technically still at war after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a ceasefire, not a truce.\n'IT MADE SENSE'\n  said he wanted to see detail and hear from North Korea on the plans.\n\"Also remember that (North Korea) has for many years proposed that the president of the United States personally engage with North Korea's leaders as an equal - one nuclear power to another,\" he said. \"What is new isnt the proposal, it's the response.\"\nA senior administration official told Reuters Trump had agreed to the meeting because it \"made sense to accept an invitation to meet with the one person who can actually make decisions instead of repeating the sort of long slog of the past\".\n\"President Trump has made his reputation on making deals,\" the official said.\nRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham said Trump's firm stance on North Korea gave the best hope in decades to resolve the threat peacefully.\n\"A word of warning to North Korean President Kim Jong Un the worst possible thing you can do is meet with President Trump in person and try to play him,\" Graham said on Twitter. \"If you do that, it will be the end of you - and your regime.\"\nSome U.S. officials and experts worry North Korea could buy time to build up and refine its nuclear arsenal, including a warhead able to survive re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, if it drags out talks with Washington.\nJOINT MILITARY EXERCISES\nIn what would be a key North Korean concession, Chung said Kim understood that \"routine\" joint military exercises between South Korea and the United States must continue.\nPyongyang had previously demanded that such joint drills be suspended in order for any U.S. talks to go forward.\nTrump has derided the North Korean leader as a \"maniac\", referred to him as \"little rocket man\", and threatened in a speech to the United Nations last year to \"totally destroy\" Kim's country of 26 million people if it attacked the United States or one of its allies.\nKim responded by calling the U.S. president a \"mentally deranged U.S. dotard\".\nTensions over North Korea rose to their highest in years in 2017   programmes   on a summit in late April, their first since 2007.\nJapan, however, remained cautious.\n\"Japan and the United States will not waver in its firm stance that they will continue to put maximum pressure until North Korea takes concrete action towards the complete, verifiable and irreversible end to nuclear missile development,\" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters in Tokyo.\nSouth Korea's Moon has said sanctions should not be eased for the sake of talks and nothing less than denuclearisation   by Christine Kim in SEOUL, and Jeff Mason, David Brunnstrom, Matt Spetalnick, Steve Holland, Yara Bayoumy and John Walcott in WASHINGTON Additional reporting by Eric Beech, Mohammad Zargham and Susan Cornwell in WASHINGTON and Kaori Kaneko in TOKYO Writing by Lincoln Feast Editing by Grant McCool and Paul Tait)",
