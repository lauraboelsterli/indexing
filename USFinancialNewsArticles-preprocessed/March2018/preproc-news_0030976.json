The central bank injected 1 trillion roubles into Otkritie in September to bail out a business that was once Russia’s largest private lender. Otkritie, under a new management, is gradually paying back the bailout funds. As of Friday, it still owed the central bank around 110 billion roubles. $1 = 57.4175 roubles Reporting by Tatiana Voronova Writing by Andrey Ostroukh Editing by Mark Potter",
