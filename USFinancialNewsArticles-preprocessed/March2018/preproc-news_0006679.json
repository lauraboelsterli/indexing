    "text": "NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - The White House has preliminary plans to host on Monday the latest in a string of meetings between rivals in the corn and oil industries to discuss how to help refiners cope with the rising costs of complying with the nationâ€™s renewable fuel laws, two sources familiar with the planning told Reuters.\nUnlike previous meetings, President Donald Trump will not be in attendance, but key lawmakers, agency leaders and executives from the oil and corn industry will be, the sources said.\nA White House official did not immediately comment.
