    "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla., In a release issued under the same headline earlier today by ParkerVision, Inc. (Nasdaq:PRKR), please note that in the Summary of Results of Operations the values for the Cost of Sales and the Write down of excess inventory for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 and the Year Ended December 31, 2017 have been changed. The corrected release follows:\nParkerVision, Inc. (Nasdaq:PRKR) (“ParkerVision”), a developer and marketer of hardware and software technologies and products for wireless applications, today announced results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter and 2017 Business Highlights and Recent Developments\n• New Products\nLaunched Milo ® brand networking products with product shipments beginning in mid-October 2017. Recognized fourth quarter 2017 sales through Amazon.com and milowifi.com of approximately $100,000. Expanded sales channel in first quarter of 2018 with the addition of Walmart.com and NeweggBusiness.com with plans for additional retail and wholesale distribution in the second quarter of 2018. Expecting television launch of Milo product by national retail firm in second quarter 2018.\n• Licensing & Litigation\nNovember 2017 hearing held in RF receiver infringement case against Apple in Germany for products utilizing Intel chips.\n- Court invited the Company to submit additional briefs to clarify certain elements of infringement claims.\n- Court denied Apple’s request for bond; however Company plans to post bond in order to expedite proceedings.\n- Decision in this case expected as early as the second quarter of 2018. U.S. District Court denies Qualcomm’s motion to move case from Florida to California and denies Apple’s motion to dismiss case for improper venue.\n- Date for claim construction hearing expected soon. Date set for validity hearing for RF transmitter patent in Germany in October 2018.\n-Results of this hearing will directly impact the LG and Apple cases in Germany for products using Qualcomm chips.\n- German counsel expects decision immediately following October hearing.\nJeffrey Parker, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are pleased with the results thus far from the launch of our Milo product line. We’ve received feedback from many Milo users regarding their positive experiences with the product and with our excellent U.S. based customer service team. Milo users have also provided feedback as to additional features they would like to see in the product line and we expect to offer new features and additional products to the Milo family in the near future. As pleased as I am with where we are with this product, I am even more excited about where we are going. We believe our sales channel expansion plans that are already underway for 2018, coupled with continued improvements and expansion of the Milo product line will result in significant increases in revenue and margins for 2018 and beyond.”\nParker continued, “We have several near-term milestones approaching in our patent enforcement cases both in the U.S. and Germany. We believe that our case in Munich involving our RF receiver technology will come to a favorable decision, possibly as early as the second quarter of 2018, which would provide a catalyst for resolving the associated dispute. Likewise, we look forward to a claim construction hearing in the District Court in Jacksonville, Florida in the coming months as we continue to push for expedited court dates in this case. We remain confident that staying the course despite the time and resources involved, will ultimately result in a successful licensing program for our RF technologies.”\nFourth quarter and Year ended 2017 Financial Results\n• Fourth Quarter Results:\nGAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $6.3 million, or $0.32 per common share, compared to a net loss of $5.7 million, or $0.43 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNon-GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017, which excluded the effects of share-based compensation expense and changes in fair value of our contingent repayment obligation, was $5.0 million, or $0.26 per common share, compared to $3.1 million, or $0.23 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increases in both GAAP and non-GAAP net losses for the fourth quarter of 2017 over the fourth quarter of 2016 is largely the result of increased costs associated with our Milo product launch and increased litigation expenses for our patent enforcement actions.\n• Year End Results:\nGAAP net loss for the year ended 2017 was $19.3 million, or $1.09 per common share, compared with a net loss of $21.5 million, or $1.76 per common share, for the year ended 2016. Non-GAAP net loss for the year ended 2017 was $16.4 million, or $0.93 per share, compared with a non-GAAP net loss of $14.4 million, or $1.18 per share, for the year ended 2016. On an annual basis, our GAAP net loss improved by approximately $2.2 million, despite a $4 million decrease in licensing revenue and increased operating expenses to support our Milo product development and marketing launch. This improvement is a result of a decrease in the loss recognized on fair value adjustments to our contingent payment obligation as well as an overall $4.5 million decrease in litigation expenses from 2016 to 2017.\n• Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights:\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $1.0 million in inventory, including $0.5 million in finished product of our Milo systems and are well positioned to support sales growth. We used cash for operations of approximately $14.1 million in 2017 compared to $14.4 million in 2016. Our operating costs in 2017 were primarily funded by approximately $13.7 million in sales of our equity securities, including proceeds of approximately $12.6 million from sales of common stock at market prices under at-market issuance sales agreements. We received $1.0 million in additional funding from our litigation funding partner in December 2017 to support ongoing international litigation.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast on March 29, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern to review its fourth quarter 2017 financial results.

The non-GAAP measures we use include Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss per Share. These non-GAAP measures exclude the effect on net loss and net loss per share of (i) changes in fair value of our contingent payment obligation and (ii) share-based compensation expense. We consider these non-GAAP measures to provide relevant supplemental information to assist investors in better understanding our operating results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 follows:\nReconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted Net Loss: Three Months Ended For the Year Ended (in thousands) December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net loss $ (6,343 ) $ (5,671 ) $ (19,259 ) $ (21,509 ) Excluded items: Share-based compensation 456 722 2,164 2,210 Change in fair value of contingent\npayment obligation 840 1,827 711 4,860 Adjusted net loss $ (5,047 ) $ (3,122 ) $ (16,384 ) $ (14,439 ) Reconciliation of Net Loss per Common Share to Adjusted Net Loss per Common Share: Three Months Ended For the Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Basic and diluted net loss per common share $ (0.32 ) $ (0.43 ) $ (1.09 ) $ (1.76 ) Excluded items on a per share basis 0.06 0.20 0.16 0.58 Adjusted net loss per common share $ (0.26 ) $ (0.23 ) $ (0.93 ) $ (1.18 )\nSource:ParkerVision, Inc.",
