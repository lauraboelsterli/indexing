REUTERS/Phil Noble /File Photo ASI, the asset management arm of Standard Life Aberdeen (SLA), will buy 50 percent of Virgin Money Unit Trust Managers for an upfront payment of 40 million pounds ($56.24 million), with the deal due to complete at the end of 2018, the firms said in a statement. Virgin Money has 200,000 customers and 3.7 billion pounds in assets under management. Jayne-Anne Ghadia, chief executive of Virgin Money, said the deal would “generate significant growth in assets under management, drive additional capital-light returns and...be game-changing for our investment business over the longer term.” Insurers and asset managers are seeking distribution deals with banks to extend their customer base. Aviva ( AV.L ) agreed a 10-year general insurance distribution deal with HSBC ( HSBA.L ) last year. Lloyds Banking Group ( LLOY.L ) pulled 109 billion pounds in investments from SLA last month. ($1 = 0.7113 pounds)",
