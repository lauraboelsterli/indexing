    "text": "BRIDGEWATER, N.J., March 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Sanofi's Toujeo® (insulin glargine 300 Units/mL) Max SoloStar®, the highest capacity long-acting insulin pen that will be available on the market.\nThe new Max SoloStar pen holds 900 Units of Toujeo, more than any other long-acting insulin pen in the U.S., and provides up to 160 Units/mL of Toujeo in a single injection.\nDue to its higher capacity, Max SoloStar may reduce the number of pens adults prescribed Toujeo use, allowing for fewer refills and related copays, depending on the person's insurance coverage. The maximum dose of up to 160 Units/mL may also help reduce the number of injections needed to deliver the required Toujeo dosage for some adults with diabetes.\n\"This new high capacity pen has a broader range of doses than the original SoloStar, delivering Toujeo, a long-acting insulin with established safety and efficacy,\" said Michelle Carnahan, North America Diabetes and Cardiovascular Head, Sanofi. \"By reducing the number of injections for people who need more long-acting insulin and lowering copay costs – both of which are important to patients – Toujeo Max SoloStar underscores Sanofi's continued commitment to help those living with diabetes.\"\nTo make Toujeo Max SoloStar as financially accessible as possible, it will be available at the same price as the original Toujeo SoloStar per insulin unit. Additionally, Sanofi will offer a savings program for Toujeo that includes both the SoloStar pen and Max SoloStar pen. Eligible commercially insured patients will pay a $0 copay if they are new to Toujeo for their first three prescription fills, and a $10 copay for their next 12 fills.\nSanofi will also offer support to adults with diabetes prescribed either SoloStar or Max SoloStar through the free Toujeo COACH program. For more information about these programs, visit www.toujeo.com .\nToujeo Max SoloStar will launch in retail pharmacies across the U.S. in Q3 2018.\nWhat is Toujeo ® (insulin glargine injection) 300 Units/mL?\nPrescription Toujeo ® is a long-acting insulin used to control blood sugar in adults with diabetes mellitus.\nToujeo ® contains 3 times as much insulin in 1 mL as standard insulin (100 Units/mL) Toujeo ® is not for use to treat diabetic ketoacidosis Toujeo ® should not be used in children\nImportant Safety Information for Toujeo ® (insulin glargine injection) 300 Units/mL\nDo not take Toujeo ® if you have low blood sugar or if you are allergic to insulin or any of the ingredients in Toujeo ® .\nD o NOT reuse needles or share insulin pens even if the needle has been changed.
