    "text": "LYNDHURST, N.J., Feb. 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CCA Industries, Inc. (NYSE AMERICAN: \"CAW\"), announced today its fourth quarter and full year results for the period ended November 30, 2017. The results can be found on the chart below.\nTotal net income was $1,831,181 for the year ended November 30, 2017 as compared to income of $1,181,210 for the year ended November 30, 2016, an increase of 55%. Total net income for the quarter ended November 30, 2017 increased to $568,196 as compared to income of 232,797 for the same period in fiscal 2016. Lance Funston, Chief Executive Officer commented, \"We have now reported two consecutive years of increasing profits. Our increase in net income of 55% was due to management's efforts to control costs and eliminate less profitable products. Our operating cash flow over the past two years has been used primarily to reduce the Company's debts related to its restructuring program with an over $3 million reduction in fiscal 2017 alone. Now that the Company is on a stable operating platform, we will be turning our focus to growing top line sales. We are fully committed to increasing both the top line sales and bottom line profits to bring increased value to all of our shareholders.\"\nThe Company will discuss more of its sales and marketing growth plans tomorrow when it holds the fiscal 2017 year-end investor phone call. Investors may phone (866) 393-4306 to participate in the call. We invite any of our current or potential shareholders to join us.
