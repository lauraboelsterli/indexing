    "text": "PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Allegheny Technologies Incorporated (NYSE: ATI) today announced that its board of directors has approved an investment to expand its iso-thermal forging and heat treating capacities to satisfy growing demand from the aerospace jet engine market. This self-funded, multi-year expansion of approximately $95 million represents ATI’s fourth iso-thermal press which, along with the associated heat treating expansion, will be located at the company's iso-thermal forging center of excellence in Cudahy, WI. The investment will take approximately 3 years to complete and fully qualify for aerospace-related production.\n“We continue to invest in our advanced forging capabilities in support of our aerospace customer’s ramp-up of next generation jet engine production. Once completed and fully qualified, this critical growth project will enable us to meet the increasing production requirements for existing long-term agreements with our engine OEM partners,” said Rich Harshman, ATI’s Chairman, President and CEO. “Iso-thermal is the most technologically advanced forging method available today and ATI’s ongoing leadership in this area is further solidified by this significant investment.”\n“This investment, along with our recent nickel-based superalloy powder expansion in Monroe, NC, will enable the High Performance Materials and Components (HPMC) segment to meet its longer-term financial goals by increasing our capacity to produce technologically advanced powder-to-iso-thermally-forged jet engine components,” said John Sims, Executive Vice President, HPMC Segment. “We are excited to add this capacity to our existing iso-thermal forging center of excellence in Cudahy, WI and to deepen our commitment to the State of Wisconsin and to our local workforce.”\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
