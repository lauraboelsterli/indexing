GLOBAL TOP NEWS • Trump set for China tariff announcement on Thursday, trade war fears grow President Donald Trump will announce tariffs on Chinese imports on Thursday, a White House official said, in a move aimed at curbing theft of U.S. technology and likely to trigger retaliation from Beijing and stoke fears of a global trade war. • Fed lifts rates, signals tougher stance as economy strengthens The U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday and forecast at least two more hikes for 2018, highlighting its growing confidence that tax cuts and government spending will boost the economy and inflation and spur more aggressive future tightening. • U.S. Congress unveils $1.3 trillion spending bill as shutdown looms Republican and Democratic leaders in the U.S. Congress late on Wednesday unveiled a $1.3 trillion bill to fund the government through September, which includes an additional $80 billion in national defense spending but fails to fund some of President Donald Trump's immigration initiatives. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) SGX Nifty Futures were trading at 10,216.00, up 0.4 percent from its previous close. The Indian rupee will likely open higher against the dollar amid broad weakness in the U.S. currency after the Federal Reserve continued to forecast three rate hikes for this year. Indian government bonds are likely to edge lower after the U.S. Federal Reserve raised interest rates as expected. Gains in crude oil prices are also likely to weigh on demand for Indian debt, traders said. The yield on the benchmark 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in 7.55 percent-7.62 percent band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • U.S. stocks ended slightly lower on Wednesday, with major indexes giving up gains in choppy trade after the Federal Reserve raised U.S. interest rates, while a strong gain in the energy space helped limit losses. • MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3 percent, with South Korea's Kospi hitting six-week high, while Japan's Nikkei gained 0.2 percent in early trade. • The dollar struggled against its peers after the Federal Reserve maintained the view that it would raise interest rate three times in 2018 instead of the four that some currency bulls had hoped for. • U.S. Treasury yields were slightly lower on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and forecast two more hikes for 2018, fewer than the three that many market participants had expected. • Oil prices rose, lifted by a surprise draw on U.S. crude inventories as well as ongoing dollar weakness which makes oil cheaper in global markets and potentially spurs demand. • Gold prices edged higher, adding to gains in the previous session on the back of a weaker dollar after the U.S. Federal Reserve disappointed investors expecting more hawkish comments on interest rate rises.
