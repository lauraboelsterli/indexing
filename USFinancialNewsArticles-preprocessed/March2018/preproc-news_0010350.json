Weekly earnings growth has also slipped below three percent during the past quarter.\n\"After a prolonged downturn, the Paychex | IHS Markit Small Business Jobs Index has stabilized at just below 100, a marginal decline in small business dynamism from a decade and a half ago,\" said James Diffley, chief regional economist at IHS Markit.\n\"The results of the Small Business Jobs Index over the past year are evidence of the tightening labor market,\" said Martin Mucci , Paychex president and CEO. \"As the growth in jobs stabilizes because of challenges in finding qualified employees, we expect to see business owners making positive changes to wages and benefits to recruit and retain top quality talent.\"\nNational Jobs Index\nAt 99.77, the Paychex | IHS Markit Small Business Jobs Index is down 1.00 percent from last year. February marks the eighth consecutive month the national index has been below 100.\nNational Wage Report\nHourly earnings growth turned lower in February, decelerating to 2.67 percent.
