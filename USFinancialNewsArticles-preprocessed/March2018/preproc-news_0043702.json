    "text": "BEIJING, March 24 (Reuters) - China’s commerce ministry said on Saturday that China expressed regret at the United States for filing a challenge at the World Trade Organization, adding that it has always respected WTO rules.\nThe office of the U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Friday that the USTR had filed a request for consultations with China at the WTO to address “discriminatory technology licensing agreements”.\nChina has been consistent in highly valuing the protection of intellectual property, the ministry said in a statement on its website.\nChina has taken strong measures to protect the legal rights and interests of both domestic and foreign owners of intellectual property, the ministry said.
