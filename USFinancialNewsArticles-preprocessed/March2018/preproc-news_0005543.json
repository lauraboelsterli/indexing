    "text": "EL SEGUNDO, Calif., March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- SmartAction , provider of the first omnichannel customer self-service platform powered by AI, today announced that it has hired two highly experienced leaders, Dale Zwizinski and Andrew Taylor , to manage direct and partner sales, respectively. In expanding the leadership team, Steve Prodger has been named Executive Vice President of Global Sales.\n\"Dale and Andrew bring tremendous knowledge, expertise, and skills that will be crucial to achieving our goals,\" said Tom Lewis, CEO of SmartAction. \"They have each built programs and processes from the ground up, so we are confident that they will quickly optimize and maximize our already thriving sales and partner functions.\"\nDale Zwizinski joins SmartAction as the Senior Vice President of North American Sales and will lead the direct sales team. His proven ability ranges from consistently exceeding quotas for established corporations like Oracle, to helping start-ups get off the ground and build their business. With an MBA from Olin Graduate School of Business, Zwizinski is laser-focused on driving customer success and ROI, and will aim to enhance processes around those goals.\nTaylor, as Vice President of Worldwide Partner Strategies, aims to expand the partner channel using his extensive knowledge and background in a variety of business disciplines, including direct and indirect sales as well as partner and sales enablement. His experience is vast across multiple continents and roles, including with Sun Microsystems (acquired by Oracle in 2010), Informatica, and Plantronics. With a passion for both sales and marketing, Taylor brings added enthusiasm to a quickly growing channel program.\nThe hiring of Zwizinski and Taylor follows SmartAction's recent management recapitalization , in which the company secured $33 million in strategic growth investments.\nAbout SmartAction\nSmartAction is transforming customer self-service with Artificial Intelligence.
