    "text": "Harley-Davidson said on Monday that a punitive, retaliatory tariff on its motorcycles in any market would have a \"significant impact\" on its sales there.\nThe European Commission's president last week threatened to impose tariffs on Harley-Davidson motorbikes if U.S. President Donald Trump followed through on a plan to impose global duties on aluminum and steel.\nHarley said in a statement that it supports free and fair trade, and the proposed U.S. import tariffs will drive up costs for all products made with aluminum and steel, regardless of their origin.",
