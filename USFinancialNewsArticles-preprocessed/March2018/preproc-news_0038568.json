FILE PHOTO: A sign of Tencent is seen during the third annual World Internet Conference in Wuzhen town of Jiaxing, Zhejiang province, China November 16, 2016. REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo Tencent shares fell to as low as HK$441.4 in morning trading. The company posted on Wednesday a 98 percent jump in quarterly net profit, beating estimates, though revenue grew slower than expected at 51 percent. With a market capitalization of around $535 billion, Tencent is Asia’s most valuable listed company and the world No.5 behind Apple, Alphabet, Amazon.com and Microsoft. Company president Martin Lau warned at a briefing on Wednesday that the company plans to invest “aggressively” in areas including video and payment, which may hurt margins.
