    "text": "SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Paris St Germain forward Neymar has had a successful operation on his injured foot and ankle, the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) said in a statement on Saturday.\nSoccer fans pose in front of Mater Dei hospital, where soccer star Neymar is undergoing surgery on a fractured metatarsal and a sprained ankle, in Belo Horizonte, Brazil March 3, 2018. REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker The world’s most expensive player was operated on by the Brazil national team doctor in Belo Horizonte to repair the fractured metatarsal and sprained ankle he suffered in last weekend’s French league match against Olympique Marseille.\nRodrigo Lasmar inserted a pin in the fifth metatarsal and the procedure“went perfectly,” the CBF said in words almost identical to those used by the French club in their statement.\n“The post-op rehabilitation will begin immediately with the presence of a PSG physiotherapist,” the CBF added.\nDoctors Gerard Saillant of PSG (Paris Saint-Germain F.C.) and Rodrigo Lasmar of CBF (Brazilian Soccer Confederation) attend a news conference in Belo Horizonte, Brazil March 3, 2018. REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker “He will be re-evaluated in around six weeks in order to specify a possible date when he can return to training.”\nFans waited outside the Mater Dei hospital on Saturday morning to chant Neymar’s name and lend their support to Brazil’s 26-year-old talisman.\nSlideshow (4 Images) Although the injury is expected keep Neymar out of action for up to three months, doctors say he will be back in time for the World Cup which kicks off in Russia in June.\nBrazil start their campaign against Switzerland on June 17 before facing Costa Rica and Serbia.\nNeymar, who became the world’s most expensive player last August when PSG paid 222 million euros ($271 million) to sign him from Barcelona, has 53 goals in 83 games for Brazil, with 28 goals and 16 assists for the Ligue 1 leaders this season.\nReporting by Andrew Downie; Editing by Ken Ferris\n ",
