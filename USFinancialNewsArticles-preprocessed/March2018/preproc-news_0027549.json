About 2.6 trillion won of the extra budget will be financed by excess tax revenue from last year, while another 1 trillion won will come from public funds managed by state-owned companies, Kim Dong-yeon said at a news conference in Seoul. Kim added that the government won’t be issuing additional bonds to fund the extra budget. ($1 = 1,064.4900 won) (Reporting by Cynthia Kim; Editing by Kim Coghill)",
