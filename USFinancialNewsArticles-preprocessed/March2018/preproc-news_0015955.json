    "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn., March 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CrossRoads ® Extremity Systems, a privately held medical device company offering innovative foot & ankle fixation implant systems and services, announced that it has recently launched the DynaFORCE ® Active Stabilization ™ Vero Medial Column Implant System. This launch represents the latest addition to the DynaFORCE Portfolio originally launched in July 2017. The Vero Medial Column Implant System combines stability of a plate with active compression of nitinol clips. It is available in various sizes and is delivered to the operating room completely sterile packaged.\nChad Hollis, Co-Founder of CrossRoads, comments, \"We believe the Vero plating system is a robust platform for medial column fusion with multiple fixation points throughout the plate. It provides surgeons with the ability to address compression across multiple joints at the same time without violating the joint surface.\"\nAbout CrossRoads Extremity Systems\nCrossRoads was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Memphis, TN. CrossRoads has experienced rapid growth through creative product development and a strong distributorship network. CrossRoads' goal is to provide a steady rhythm of novel and clinically relevant new products that distinguish us from other companies.\nIn addition to providing novel products, CrossRoads strives to find ways to help hospitals save money and improve efficiency.
