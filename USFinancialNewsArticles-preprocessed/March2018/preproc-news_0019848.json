Pyeongchang brought the curtain down on Asia’s first Winter Games outside Japan on Feb. 25. Despite issues such as a norovirus outbreak and extreme temperatures in the first week of competition, organisers were widely praised for running a polished Games. Other former recipients of the Cheongryong (blue dragon) honour include 2010 Olympic figure skating gold medallist Kim Yuna and Dutchman Guus Hiddink, who coached the Korean national soccer team to the semi-finals of the 2002 World Cup.
