The plaintiff alleged that the Company was experiencing significant, undisclosed problems in its Renewable segment. The plaintiff claimed that although defendants disclosed issues with a single project in the Renewable business on June 28, 2016, they failed to disclose that similar problems were significantly and negatively impacting other projects in the Company's Renewable segment, instead assuring investors during a business update call that the problems were \"a single project issue.\"\nOn September 28, 2017, an amended complaint was filed and on November 13, 2017, the defendants filed their motion to dismiss the case. On February 8, 2018, the judge denied the defendantsâ€™ motion to dismiss the lawsuit.\nThose who purchased Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises Inc (NYSE:BW) shares should contact the Shareholders Foundation, Inc.\nThe Shareholders Foundation, Inc. is a professional portfolio legal monitoring and a settlement claim filing service, which does research related to shareholder issues and informs investors of securities class actions, settlements, judgments, and other legal related news to the stock/financial market.
