    "text": " 15 a.m. ET Share \nAction paves way for radio giant to shed most of the debt from 2008 buyout; Clear Channel Outdoor billboards not part of Ch. 11 Getty Images Despite sluggish sales and a steady loss of listeners to new platforms, the company had avoided bankruptcy for years by pushing out debt maturities through refinancing and swaps. \nBy Soma Biswas Anne Steele \niHeartMedia Inc., the company behind the biggest U.S. radio broadcaster, filed for bankruptcy protection after reaching an agreement in principle with investors over a balance-sheet restructuring, a decade after a private-equity-led buyout left the company laden with billions in debt. \niHeartMedia IHRT, -1.03% said in a statement early Thursday the agreement in principle was with holders of more than $10 billion of its outstanding debt and its financial sponsors. \nThe chapter 11 filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, came after months of talks with investors on restructuring terms. \nBased in San Antonio, iHeart operates 856 terrestrial stations and controls Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc., one of the biggest billboard companies in the world. \nThe company said Clear Channel Outdoor and its subsidiaries didnâ€™t commence chapter 11 proceedings. It also said its day-to-day operations would continue as usual during the restructuring process. \niHeartMedia said it believes its cash on hand, together with cash generated from continuing operations, will be sufficient to fund and support the business during the bankruptcy proceedings.",
