    "text": "March 8, 2018 / 6:57 PM / Updated 15 minutes ago Financial services firm JTC poised for 310 mln stg London IPO - source Ben Martin 1 Min Read LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - Financial services firm JTC Group is poised to list on the London stock market in an initial public offering that values the business at about 310 million pounds ($428 million), according to a source familiar with the matter. JTC will price its shares at 290 pence apiece in the flotation that could be announced as soon as Friday, the source said. Jersey-based JTC, which was set up 31 years ago, provides administration services to funds with more than $85 billion in assets, spanning real estate to private equity. It is majority-owned by its employees and also counts CBPE Capital as a minority investor. Stockbrokers Zeus and Numis are working on JTCâ€™s listing plans, which Reuters first reported last month. $1 = 0.7242 pounds Reporting by Ben Martin Editing by Pamela Barbaglia and Mark Potter",
