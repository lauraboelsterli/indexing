    "text": "CLEARWATER, Fla., March 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Heritage Insurance Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:HRTG) (\"Heritage\" or the \"Company\"), a property and casualty insurance holding company, today reported its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights\nBook value per share increased 18.2% year-over-year to $14.67 as of December 31, 2017 $8.2 million of dividends paid in 2017; book value per share increase of 20.2% adding back dividends Fourth quarter net loss of $5.0 million; full year net loss of $1.1 million Fourth quarter adjusted net income* of $30.3 million; full year adjusted net income* of $41.1 million Loss per share for the fourth quarter was ($0.18) and ($0.04) for the full year 2017 Adjusted earnings per share* for the fourth quarter was $1.23 and $1.53 for the full year 2017 Premiums in force increased by 48% to $940.8 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $635.3 million at December 31, 2016 $379.8 million of stockholders' equity at December 31, 2017 Repurchased 5,340,267 shares of our common stock in 2017 for an aggregate purchase price of $61.6 million A 62% increase in policy count from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017 Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.06 per share Closed on the acquisition of Narragansett Bay Insurance Company (\"NBIC\") on November 30, 2017 Hurricane Irma Closed 87% of approximately 30,000 Irma Claims Vertically integrated repair division responded to approximately 9,000 Hurricane Irma claims\nBruce Lucas, Chairman & CEO, stated \"I'm pleased to announce that we had record earnings in the fourth quarter and recorded $30.3 million of adjusted net income*. By all accounts we had a tremendous 2017 and delivered a strong 20.2% total shareholder return to our investors in a year marked by a major Florida hurricane.\nGrowth rates continue to accelerate and the Company recorded the best year in our history as measured by personal lines new business written, despite Hurricane Irma which temporarily impacted sales. Heritage ended 2017 with an increase in policy count of 62% year over year. Our voluntary sales and diversification continue to outpace management's expectations, and we have new state and product initiatives in place that will further accelerate our sales in 2018.\nWe had a fourth straight year of record growth at our wholly-owned construction and mitigation division, Contractors Alliance Network (\"CAN\"), and we exceeded $100 million of revenue in 2017 for the first time in our history. CAN currently provides loss mitigation services to our insurance company affiliates. We are continuing to expand the division and plan to launch operations in additional states in 2018, which we believe will further improve our consolidated loss ratios. 2017 was a great example of our continued lower trend in consolidated loss ratios. Our year-over-year consolidated gross loss ratio improved to an impressive 24.4% compared to 43.2% at the end of 2016.\nAdditionally, the integration of NBIC with Heritage Insurance has gone well. NBIC provides substantial diversification to the Heritage portfolio and reduces our Florida concentration from 71.3% to just 32.1% of total insured value. This diversification, and our substantial multi-year reinsurance, will benefit our 2018-2019 reinsurance program in both capacity and pricing, which we believe is a unique hedge compared to other insurance carriers in the Florida market. We had another profitable year in 2017 and we are well positioned for increased growth and profitability in 2018.\"\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively (in thousands, except percentages and per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\nChange\n2017\n2016\nChange\nRevenue\nGross premiums written\n$\n169,720\n$\n154,911\n10%\n$\n625,565\n$\n626,704\n(0)%\nGross premiums earned\n$\n183,279\n$\n160,242\n14%\n$\n643,304\n$\n640,518\n0%\nCeded premiums\n$\n(81,551)\n$\n(65,336)\n25%\n$\n(263,740)\n$\n(228,797)\n15%\nNet premiums earned\n$\n101,728\n$\n94,906\n7%\n$\n379,564\n$\n411,721\n(8)%\nTotal revenue\n$\n108,618\n$\n102,806\n6%\n$\n406,623\n$\n438,958\n(7)%\nOperating income/(loss)\n$\n23,171\n$\n(3,644)\n(736)%\n$\n49,535\n$\n56,765\n(13)%\n(Loss)/Income before taxes\n$\n(17,210)\n$\n(4,006)\n330%\n$\n(5,892)\n$\n56,403\n(110)%\nNet (loss)/income\n$\n(5,048)\n$\n(2,856)\n77%\n$\n(1,119)\n$\n33,865\n(103)%\nAdjusted Net Income/(loss)*\n$\n30,286\n$\n(2,856)\n(1,160)%\n$\n41,098\n$\n33,865\n21%\nPer Share Data:\nBook value per share\n$\n14.67\n$\n12.41\n18%\n$\n14.67\n$\n12.41\n18%\nEPS\n$\n(0.18)\n$\n(0.09)\n100%\n$\n(0.04)\n$\n1.14\n(104)%\nEPS (Adjusted Net Income)*\n$\n1.23\n$\n(0.09)\n(1,466)%\n$\n1.53\n$\n1.14\n34%\nReturn on average equity - Net Income/(Loss)\n(1.5)%\n(0.8)%\n(0.7)\npts\n(0.3)%\n9.5%\n(9.8)\npts\nReturn on average equity â€“ Adjusted Net Income/(Loss)*\n8.9%\n(0.8)%\n9.7\npts\n11.1%\n9.5%\n1.6\npts\nWeighted average shares outstanding\nBasic\n24,280,095\n28,649,166\n(15)%\n26,798,465\n29,632,171\n(10)%\nDiluted\n24,280,095\n28,649,166\n(15)%\n26,798,465\n29,634,349\n(10)%\nWeighted average shares outstanding\n(Adjusted Net Income)*\nBasic\n24,280,095\n28,649,166\n26,798,465\n29,632,171\nDiluted\n24,636,458\n28,649,166\n26,957,065\n29,634,349\nRatios to Gross Premiums\nEarned:\nCeded premium ratio\n44.5%\n40.8%\n3.7\npts\n41.0%\n35.7%\n5.3\npts\nGross loss ratio\n24.4%\n43.2%\n(18.8)\npts\n31.3%\n37.3%\n(6.0)\npts\nGross expense ratio\n22.2%\n23.2%\n(1.0)\npts\n24.2%\n22.4%\n1.8\npts\nCombined ratio\n91.1%\n107.2%\n(16.1)\npts\n96.5%\n95.4%\n1.1\npts\nRatios to Net Premiums\nEarned:\nNet loss ratio\n44.0%\n72.9%\n(28.9)\npts\n53.1%\n58.0%\n(4.9)\npts\nNet expense ratio\n40.0%\n39.3%\n0.7\npts\n41.0%\n34.8%\n6.2\npts\nCombined ratio\n84.0%\n112.2%\n(28.2)\npts\n94.1%\n92.8%\n1.3\npts\nRatios\nCeded premium ratio.

A combined ratio under 100% generally reflects profitable underwriting results.\nQuarterly Financial Results\nWe incurred a GAAP net loss of $5.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a GAAP net loss of $2.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted net income* was $30.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to an adjusted net loss* of $2.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by Hurricane Matthew by approximately $19.1 million. The Company's operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was favorably impacted by one month of earnings from NBIC, following the closing of the acquisition on November 30, 2017.\nOperating income increased to $23.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from an operating loss of $3.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-operating items include a $35.3 million non-cash charge for the change in fair value of the conversion option liability related to our recent issuance of $136.8 million of convertible senior notes (\"the convertible notes\"), which is not tax deductible, and interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs of $5.0 million. At issuance, the conversion of all of our outstanding convertible notes into common stock would have resulted in the issuance of more than 20% of the Company's voting power and shares of common stock outstanding, which requires stockholder approval under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange. On December 1, 2017, the Company held a Special Meeting of Stockholders, at which the Company's stockholders approved the issuance of the Company's common stock upon conversion of the convertible notes. Prior to December 1 st , the convertible notes were convertible only into cash. The inability to settle the convertible notes into common stock prior to December 1 st created a conversion option liability under GAAP, which is recorded at fair value until the date of the shareholder vote on December 1 st . Due to the significant increase in our stock price, this hypothetical liability increased $35.3 million during the fourth quarter and a total of $42.2 million from the date of issuance of the note through December 1 st . Upon stockholder approval, Heritage reclassified the conversion option liability to a component of equity, thereby removing the volatility of an adverse impact to future earnings. We believe the charge to income related to the conversion option liability does not accurately reflect the performance of the Company because it is a non-cash item which does not impact taxes or book value. Absent this non-cash charge, our adjusted net income* was $30.3 million for the quarter, a new record for the Company.\nGross premiums earned were $183.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $160.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of approximately $28.4 million of NBIC gross premiums earned for the month of December and $7.3 million from the addition of the Sawgrass Mutual policies during the third quarter, partially offset by selective underwriting and exposure management aimed at improving underwriting results in Florida. For example, the Company has not participated in the assumption of Citizens policies since the second quarter of 2016, has discontinued writing new personal lines business in the Tri-County area, and has selectively reduced its commercial residential exposure.\nNBIC extensively utilizes quota share reinsurance programs, which generate ceding commission income. We have included NBIC's fourth quarter ceding commission earned of $8.6 million from its quota share agreements as a reduction to policy acquisition costs in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nCeded premiums as a percentage of gross premiums earned were 44.5% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 40.8% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase is a result of the quota share reinsurance agreements that NBIC has in place. Excluding the results of NBIC, the Company's ceded premium ratio would have been 37.1% for the fourth quarter of 2017. The ceded premium ratio for the fourth quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by about 2 percentage points due to a true-up in the non-catastrophe reinsurance programs.\nOur net loss ratio was 44% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 72.9% for the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter of 2016 net loss ratio was negatively impacted by 20.1 points due to $19.1 million of losses from Hurricane Matthew. Also contributing to the lower net loss ratio is an improvement in Heritage P&C's personal lines loss ratio, due to the underwriting and pricing actions that the Company has taken.\nThe Company's net expense ratio was 40.0% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 39.3% for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nHeritage's net combined ratio was 84.0% for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 112.2% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Hurricane Matthew had a 20.1 point impact on the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating income, which closely tracks with the net combined ratio, increased from $23.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from an operating loss of $3.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull Year Financial Results\nOperating income was $49.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $56.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Non-operating items include a $42.2 million non-cash charge for the change in valuation of the conversion option liability. Gross premiums earned were $643.3 million in 2017 compared to $640.5 million in 2016. The Company's combined ratio on a gross basis was 96.5% for 2017 compared to 95.4% for 2016. The Company experienced a net loss of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Adjusted Net Income* for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $41.1 million compared to adjusted net income* of $33.9 million for the prior year.\nBook Value Analysis\nBook value per share increased 18.2% to $14.67 at December 31, 2017 compared to the prior year.\nAs Of\nBook Value Per Share\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nDecember 31, 2015\nNumerator:\nCommon stockholders' equity\n$ 379,816\n$ 357,959\n$ 356,553\nDenominator:\nTotal Shares Outstanding\n25,885,004\n28,840,443\n30,441,410\nBook Value Per Common Share\n$ 14.67\n$ 12.41\n$ 11.71\nFinancial Guidance\nWe focus on creating shareholder value over the long run and establish financial and operational goals and initiatives to achieve that objective. Although we prefer stable and increasing shortâ€“term value improvements, we may invest in business strategies and initiatives during a specific year that are designed to enhance our longer-term performance, profit and growth trajectory. Although we understand that such investments may unfavorably impact our short-term results we believe they will provide for the continued long-term profitability and growth our shareholders expect.\nWe also provide limited earnings estimates to the market and comment on earnings estimates by analysts. As a result, our reported results for a particular period may vary from investors 'expectations. The very nature of our property insurance business may cause additional volatility in our consolidated results.\nConference Call Details:\nThursday, March 8, 2018 â€“ 8:30 a.m. ET\nParticipant Dial-in Numbers Toll Free:\n1-888-346-3095\nParticipant International Dial In:\n1-412-902-4258\nCanada Toll Free:\n1-855-669-9657\nWebcast:\nTo listen to the live webcast, please go to the investor section of the company's website .

We use these metrics to assess the progress of our business, make decisions on where to allocate capital, time and investments and assess the long-term performance of our company. Certain of the financial metrics are reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP and certain of these metrics are considered non-GAAP financial measures. As our business evolves, we may make changes to our key financial and operating metrics used to measure our business in future periods. For further information and a reconciliation to the most applicable financial measure under U.S. GAAP, refer to our reconciliation below.\nNon-GAAP adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure and the most directly adjusted GAAP financial measure is net income. Non-GAAP adjusted net income is calculated by adding back the non-cash charges of $35.3 million and $42.2 million for the change in valuation of the convertible option feature related to our convertible senior notes for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively. We use Non-GAAP adjusted net income internally as a performance measure and believe that this measure reflects the financial performance of the Company's ongoing business. When combined with the primary GAAP presentations, Non-GAAP adjusted net income provides meaningful supplemental information about our operating performance.\nWe believe that this non-GAAP financial measure facilitates comparisons with our historical results and with the results of peer companies who present similar measures (although other companies may define non-GAAP measures differently than we define them, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures).\nThis metric should only be considered as supplemental to the metric net income as a measure of our performance. Adjusted net Income should also not be used as a supplement to, or substitute for, cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP).\nNon-GAAP adjusted earnings per share (EPS) is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated by dividing the Non-GAAP adjusted net income by the number of fully diluted shares at end of the period. Shares are fully diluted in the non-GAAP adjusted EPS calculation when using Non-GAAP adjusted net income due to the positive net income generated.\nThe following is a reconciliation of Non-GAAP net operating income to the most adjusted U.S. GAAP financial measure, net income, for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 (in thousands) (Unaudited):\nThree Months Ended December\nYear Ended
