    "text": "MONTREAL, March 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Leader in the field of Information Security Awareness (ISA) and Phishing Simulation, Terranova Worldwide Corporation announces the appointment of sales executive Roch Cousineau in the role of Chief Revenue Officer. Following a recent $5 million capital injection by the Fonds de solidarité FTQ, Mr. Cousineau joins Terranova with a wealth of experience to spearhead its international expansion and oversee the execution of the company's strategic objectives.\nAs commented by company founder and CEO Lise Lapointe: \"We are thrilled to welcome Roch to the team. With his versatile background in sales, IT and cybersecurity, along with his uplifting energy, Roch will be an important contributor to our company's growth. Innovation is at the core of our solutions and as such, his insight into the market will sharpen Terranova's sales and marketing initiatives.\"\nMr. Cousineau sees the need for a paradigm shift in IT security: \"As employees are increasingly becoming the most effective vector of attacks through social-engineering techniques, some of the IT security efforts and investment budgeted for technology-based solutions should shift to the people part of the equation. At Terranova, we have the content, the framework and the platforms necessary to implement a truly impactful security awareness campaign. In fact, we believe that the actual end goal is to move your personnel along the adoption continuum: from awareness to alertness, so that they adopt new behaviours and are always ready and able to fend off attacks aimed at them. At Terranova, we help our clients put everyone on the right course!\"\nWith a BSc in Computer Science, a Master in Business Demonstration and over 30 years of experience in IT with multinational organizations, Chief Revenue Officer Roch Cousineau brings a unique blend of savoir-faire to solidify Terranova's position as a global leader in ISA and increase the adoption of the company's people-centric, adaptable and scalable solutions.\nAbout Terranova WW Corporation\nRecognized in Gartner's Magic Quadrant, Terranova develops comprehensive e-learning solutions for information security awareness.
