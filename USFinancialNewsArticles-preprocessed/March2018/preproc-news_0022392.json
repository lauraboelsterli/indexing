(NASDAQ:AIMT), a biopharmaceutical company developing treatments for life-threatening food allergies, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.\n“The progress we made in 2017 has set up 2018 as a potentially transformational year for Aimmune,” said Stephen Dilly, MBBS, Ph.D. “We kicked off this year with positive Phase 3 PALISADE results, which form the core clinical element for our regulatory submissions for approval of AR101 to treat peanut allergy in the U.S. and Europe. We are extremely pleased with the continued high level of enthusiasm from patients and investigators in our trials, which have exceeded enrollment targets. In parallel, we are advancing manufacturing and pre-commercial activities in anticipation of a potential commercial launch. With proceeds from our recently completed public offering, we are well financed to deliver on our goals for AR101 and to drive our pipeline of CODIT™ products forward for additional life-threatening food allergies.”\nRecent AR101 Program Highlights\nAnnounced Positive Topline Results of Phase 3 PALISADE trial. In February 2018, Aimmune announced that the Phase 3 PALISADE trial met its primary endpoint, as 67% of AR101 patients ages 4–17 tolerated at least a 600-mg dose of peanut protein in the exit double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) compared to 4% of placebo patients (p<0.00001). The lower-bound of the 95% confidence interval of the difference between treatment arms at the primary endpoint was 53%, greatly exceeding the pre-specified threshold of 15% (p<0.00001). Serious adverse events related to study drug were reported in 1.1% of AR101 patients ages 4–17. Three suspected cases of eosinophilic esophagitis were observed with only one case confirmed following biopsy.\nOver-Enrolled Phase 3 RAMSES Real-World Trial. In January 2018, Aimmune announced over-enrollment of RAMSES, which does not require a DBPCFC, and which will monitor treatment-emergent adverse events during a six-month up-dosing period. Patients will then be followed in an open-label manner for at least six months on the maintenance dose of 300 mg of AR101 per day. A total of 506 peanut-allergic patients ages 4-17 have been randomized to treatment with AR101 or placebo.\nOver-Enrolled Phase 3 ARTEMIS Trial in Europe. In February 2018, Aimmune completed enrollment of ARTEMIS in Europe. ARTEMIS is designed to explore protection at an endpoint of tolerating a single dose of 1,000 mg of peanut protein in a DBPCFC after nine months of treatment. A total of 175 patients ages 4-17 have been randomized to treatment with AR101 or placebo.\nCompleted Enrollment in PALISADE Follow-On Trial ARC004. In January 2018, Aimmune completed enrollment in ARC004, which is designed to test the potential for reduced frequency of dosing during the maintenance phase of AR101 therapy. A total of 358 patients ages 4-17 years (92% of those who completed PALISADE) chose to participate in ARC004.\n4Q 2017 and Recent Corporate Highlights\nFormed Clinical Collaboration with Regeneron and Sanofi. In October 2017, Aimmune announced a partnership with Regeneron and Sanofi to explore desensitization with AR101 with adjunctive dupilumab in peanut-allergic patients in a Phase 2 clinical trial, which is expected to begin in 2018.\nBroadened and Extended Supply Agreement with Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts . In January 2018, Aimmune announced the expansion and extension of its exclusive supply agreement with Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts, the leading handler, processor, and exporter of peanuts and tree nuts, to support the anticipated potential commercialization of AR101.\nExpanded the Aimmune Scientific Advisory Board. In February 2018, Aimmune announced that Prof. George du Toit and Dr. Wayne Shreffler, leading academic experts in allergy and immunology, joined the company’s Scientific Advisory Board.\nUpcoming Milestones\nTiming Milestone 2Q 18 Presentation of Phase 3 PALISADE data at the EAACI 37 th Annual Congress 2H 18 RAMSES data available 2H 18 Initiate ARC005 trial of AR101 in infants and toddlers 3Q 18 Data cut from ARC004 YE 18 Initiate Phase 2 trial of AR101 with adjunctive dupilumab YE 18 Submit Biologics License Application for AR101 to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration YE 18 Submit Investigational New Drug Application for AR201 in egg allergy 1H 19 ARTEMIS data available 1H 19 Submit Marketing Authorisation Application for AR101 to the European Medicines Agency 1H 19 Initiate Phase 2 clinical trial of AR201 in egg allergy 2H 19 Submit Investigational New Drug Application for AR301 in walnut allergy 2H 19 Initiate Phase 2 clinical trial of AR301 in walnut allergy 2H 19 Potential approval of AR101 in the U.S. Fourth Quarter and Full Year Financial Results\nFor the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, net loss was $41.2 million and $131.3 million, respectively, compared to net loss of $25.1 million and $80.8 million for the comparable periods of 2016.\nOn a per share basis, net loss for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, was $0.81 and $2.61, respectively, compared to net loss per share of $0.55 and $1.89 for the comparable periods of 2016. The weighted average shares outstanding for each of the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, were 50.8 million and 50.4 million shares, respectively, compared to 45.5 million and 42.8 million shares for the comparable periods in 2016.\nResearch and development expenses for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, were $28.7 million and $89.3 million, respectively, compared to $17.0 million and $54.6 million for the comparable periods in 2016. The increase was primarily due to the progression of the AR101 program, which include the RAMSES, ARC008, ARTEMIS and ARC011 that commenced in 2017, and higher contract manufacturing costs to support clinical development.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, were $13.0 million and $43.9 million, respectively, compared to $8.3 million and $26.9 million for the comparable periods in 2016. The increase was primarily due to additional employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, and external professional services as Aimmune continues to build the infrastructure to support the development and potential commercialization of AR101.\nCash, cash equivalents, and investments totaled $182.4 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $282.5 million at December 31, 2016. The decrease primarily reflects cash used in operations. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company completed the sale and issuance of an aggregate of 6,325,000 shares of Common Stock, which includes the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase an additional 825,000 shares of common stock, the Company received net proceeds from the Offering of approximately $190.0 million.\nAbout Aimmune Therapeutics\nAimmune Therapeutics, Inc., is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing treatments for life-threatening food allergies.
