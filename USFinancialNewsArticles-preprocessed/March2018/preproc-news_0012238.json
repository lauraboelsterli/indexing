    "text": "LeBron James racked up 31 points, seven rebounds and seven assists in three quarters, and the Cleveland Cavaliers pounded the struggling Detroit Pistons 112-90 on Monday night at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland.\nLarry Nance Jr. supplied 22 points and 15 rebounds after being inserted into the starting lineup. He replaced starting center Tristan Thompson, who suffered an ankle sprain against Denver on Saturday that will sideline him for multiple games.\nCleveland coach Tyronn Lue also made another lineup switch, inserting shooting guard Rodney Hood in place of Cedi Osman. Hood tossed in 13 points, while Osman added 12 points off the bench. Two other reserves, Kyle Korver and Jordan Clarkson, chipped in 11 points apiece.\nCleveland outscored Detroit 58-41 after halftime. Overall, the Cavaliers shot 48.9 percent from the field while holding the Pistons to 39.1 percent shooting. Cleveland also dominated on the boards, outrebounding Detroit 53-40.\nBlake Griffin led the Pistons, who have lost three straight and nine of their last 11 games, with 25 points, eight rebounds and five assists. Andre Drummond contributed 15 points and nine rebounds, and Reggie Bullock tossed in 11 points for Detroit.\nNance and James carried the Cavs to a 54-49 halftime lead, combining for 34 points and 15 rebounds. A 14-5 run gave Cleveland a nine-point lead late in the half before Detroit cut it to five with a 6-2 spurt. Griffin led the Pistons with 15 first-half points.\nCleveland outscored Detroit 36-21 in the third quarter.\nJames erupted for 13 points in the first 4 1/2 minutes of the second half to give Cleveland a commanding 71-54 lead. He drained a trio of 3s during that 17-5 run, including a pullup in transition to finish it off.\nDetroit scored the next six points, but its frustration mounted as Drummond and Griffin were both whistled for technicals. The Cavaliers scored eight of the last 10 points in the quarter.\nKorver opened the fourth with a 3-pointer, and Lue was able to rest his starters in the lopsided game.\nâ€”Field Level Media\n ",
