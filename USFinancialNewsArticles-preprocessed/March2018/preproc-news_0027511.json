A U.S. Dollar note is seen in this June 22, 2017 illustration photo. REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration The spread on the three-month London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) and three-month overnight indexed swap rate may widen to 50 basis points before gradually easing in the second quarter. On Tuesday, the spread reached 48.45 basis points, the widest since January 2012, the analysts wrote in a research note. Reporting by Richard Leong",
