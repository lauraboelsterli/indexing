    "text": "LONDON (AP) â€” The Latest on the Facebook privacy scandal (all times local):\n11:30 p.m.\nPublished  \nCNN is citing unnamed sources   legislators.\n \n2 p.m.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is snubbing a summons from a British Parliamentary committee investigating the rise of fake news, offering to send senior executives in his place.\nDamian Collins, chairman of Parliament's media committee, urged Zuckerberg to \"think again\" Tuesday about choosing not to appear and repeated an offer to have him testify via video link.\nFacebook has offered to send chief technology officer Mike Schroepfer or chief product officer Chris Cox.\nZuckerberg is also under pressure to appear before U.S. Congress following allegations that consultants Cambridge Analytica harvested details of 50 million Facebook users and used the material in U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 election.\n1:50 p.m.\nThe computer expert who sparked a global debate over electronic privacy has told lawmakers that the official campaign backing Britain's exit from the European Union had access to data that was inappropriately collected from millions of Facebook users.\nChristopher Wylie previously alleged that Cambridge Analytica used data harvested from more than 50 million Facebook users to help U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign.\nWylie told the House of Commons' media committee on Tuesday that he \"absolutely\" believed Canadian campaign consultant AggregateIQ had drawn on Cambridge Analytica's databases for its work on the EU referendum.\nHe told the committee: \"You can't have targeting software that doesn't access the database. Cambridge Analytica would have a database and AIQ would access that database, otherwise the software wouldn't work.\"\n9:55 a.m.\nThe whistleblower at the heart of the Facebook privacy scandal is set to testify before British lawmakers investigating the increasing rise of fake news.\nChristopher Wylie has alleged that Cambridge Analytica harvested details of 50 million Facebook users and used the material in U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign. It is alleged the material made it possible to micro-target users with campaign material.\nAt a news conference on Monday on a linked issue, Wylie declined to answer questions about whether the data was also used in Britain by the campaign to leave the European Union. He said he would discuss the matter when he spoke to lawmakers from Parliament's media committee on Tuesday.",
