    "text": "March 2, 2018 / 3:04 PM / in 6 hours Factbox: Trump on Twitter (Mar 02) - Trade wars, steel, reciprocal taxes Reuters Staff 2 Min Read The following statements were posted to the verified Twitter accounts of U.S. President Donald Trump, @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS. FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump heads to the Marine One helicopter to depart the White House on his way to address the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in Washington, U.S., February 23, 2018. REUTERS/Jim Bourg/File Photo The opinions expressed are his own. Reuters has not edited the statements or confirmed their accuracy. @realDonaldTrump : - When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win. Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don’t trade anymore-we win big. It’s easy! [0550 EST] - Alec Baldwin, whose dying mediocre career was saved by his terrible impersonation of me on SNL, now says playing me was agony. Alec, it was agony for those who were forced to watch. Bring back Darrell Hammond, funnier and a far greater talent! [0607 EST] - Eric, we are all with you and your family! Look forward to seeing you back on T.V. bit.ly/2F76lmA [0618 EST] - We must protect our country and our workers. Our steel industry is in bad shape. IF YOU DON’T HAVE STEEL, YOU DON’T HAVE A COUNTRY! [0801 EST] - When a country Taxes our products coming in at, say, 50%, and we Tax the same product coming into our country at ZERO, not fair or smart. We will soon be starting RECIPROCAL TAXES so that we will charge the same thing as they charge us. $800 Billion Trade Deficit-have no choice! [0857 EST]",
