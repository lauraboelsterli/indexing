    "text": "By Polina Marinova 9:28 AM EDT ANTITRUST SHOWDOWN\nGood morning, Term Sheet readers.\nAT&T and the U.S. Department of Justice will come head to head in court this week over the telecom company’s $85 billion proposed purchase of Time Warner.\nHere’s why this matters:\n• The merger fight has broad implications for various industries, specifically media and tech. We’re going to find out how much power the government has to block large-scale corporate consolidation.\n• A win for the DOJ would mean the government is reversing decades of generally permissive policy in favor of a more harsh view of vertical mergers .\n• A win for AT&T would mean more mega-mergers on the horizon. As the WSJ notes , “most legacy media firms see gaining scale as their only shot against the tech giants. If the government loses its case, they will have a green light to move forward.”\nEither way, the decision has the power to re-shape the media & tech landscape as we know it. One decision could curtail future M&A activity but another could clear the wave of vertical mergers without government interference. You better believe Disney and Comcast, which are both bidding for Fox, are watching closely.\nAs Fortune’s Andrew Nusca wrote in today’s CEO Daily :\nNamely: How can large legacy companies compete with the largest tech companies—Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook , and so forth—if they can’t scale up through M&A? The world’s largest telecom company combining with the No. 3 entertainment company is sure to create an enormous media giant worthy of scrutiny. Indeed, the combined market cap of ATT-TWX is about $300 billion. But how big is too big when you’re competing against companies with market caps well above $500 billion? What would you do if one or more deep-pocketed tech companies came gunning for your industry?\n…But of course, nothing is ever black and white: The judge hearing the lawsuit is t he same judge who approved the settlement between the DOJ and Comcast over its acquisition of NBCUniversal. The case could change how consumers watch (and pay for) TV shows & movies. AT&T will back off making its political argument in court , but the question of presidential interference looms.\nAdvertisement THE LATEST FROM FORTUNE...\n• Big Data: How This Rural Hospital Is Outdoing Silicon Valley (by Erika Fry)\n• Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Is Visiting the U.S. This Week.
