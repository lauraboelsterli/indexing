    "text": "WASHINGTON, March 23 (Reuters) - The leaders of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee on Friday wrote Facebook Inc chief executive Mark Zuckerberg detailing new concerns about the social media company's use of data and formally requesting that he testify at a future hearing.\n\"The hearing will examine the harvesting and sale of personal information from more than 50 million Facebook users, potentially without their notice or consent and in violation of Facebook policy,\" wrote chairman Representative Greg Walden, a Republican who chairs the panel, and Frank Pallone, the top Democrat, and other committee leaders.
