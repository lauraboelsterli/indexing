Those are two sectors that are up year-to-date and what we're seeing is profit-taking in the quarter-end,\" said Michael O'Rourke, Chief Market Strategist, Jonestrading, Greenwich, Connecticut.\nAt 12:41 p.m. ET (1641 GMT) the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 134.09 points, or 0.56 percent, helped by gains in financial shares.\nThe S&P 500 was up 9.84 points, or 0.37 percent and the Nasdaq Composite was down 4.18 points, or 0.06 percent, at 7,004.63.\nThe main indexes are on track for their second straight month of losses, hurt by fears of a trade war between the United States and China as well as rising U.S. interest rates.\nComments from top officials of the two countries had given a sense that they would negotiate over President Donald Trump's move to impose tariffs on Chinese goods.\nHowever, China's state-run Global Times reported on Wednesday that the country was expected to soon announce a list of retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports.\nTesla dropped about 6 percent after the U.S. government said it would investigate a fatal crash and vehicle fire of a Model X in California.\nLululemon Athletica surged 11 percent after the Canadian athletic apparel maker posted a surprisingly strong fourth-quarter profit and forecast further growth in the first quarter.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,647 to 1,178. On the Nasdaq, 1,421 issues fell and 1,413 advanced. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar and additional reporting by Yashaswini Swamynathan in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)",
