Mass-circulation daily newspaper Oesterreich said the stabbings occurred in the Leopoldstadt district near Viennaâ€™s famous Prater Park. News website heute.at said the victims were a man and two women aged between 40 and 50. APA said police were searching for a lone assailant who had fled the scene, and that the motive for the attack was not known. The police were not immediately available for comment.
