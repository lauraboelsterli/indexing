As a result of the early launch uptake of KEVEYIS, the first and only FDA-approved treatment for Primary Periodic Paralysis (PPP), we made the decision to more than double our field-based team in the fourth quarter to meet growing market demand and position us for success in 2018 and beyond. This expanded investment reflects the significant opportunity in the market, the need to raise awareness of this ultra-rare disease and our commitment to patient communities, such as PPP, that may otherwise go ignored,\" said Matthew Pauls, president and chief executive officer of Strongbridge Biopharma.\n“In 2017, we completed enrollment in SONICS, our pivotal Phase 3 study of RECORLEV™ (levoketoconazole) in Cushing’s syndrome and look forward to top-line results in mid-2018. We are also excited to launch our second rare disease product, MACRILEN™ (macimorelin), in the middle of the year,” Pauls added.\nFull-Year 2017 Corporate & Financial Highlights\nEarly Launch Success with KEVEYIS Demonstrates Significant Market Opportunity:\nAchieved net product sales of $3.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, a 20% increase compared to $2.5 million in the third quarter. Expanded the Company’s rare neuromuscular field-based team from 12 to 21 sales representatives, along with the addition of three regional business directors and three patient access managers. Launched the no-cost Uncovering Periodic Paralysis genetic testing program at the end of the third quarter. Full-year 2018 revenue guidance for KEVEYIS of $16 to $19 million.\nRECORLEV Phase 3 Clinical Development Program Continues to Progress\nCompleted target enrollment in the Phase 3 SONICS study in the second quarter of 2017. Top-line results from SONICS are anticipated in mid-2018. Began activating sites for the Phase 3 LOGICS study in the fourth quarter of 2017, with dosing of the first patients anticipated in the first quarter of 2018 and availability of top-line data expected in the first quarter of 2019. Two Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reviews were held in 2017. In each case, the DSMB recommended that the Phase 3 SONICS study continue as planned with no protocol changes.\nStrongbridge Financial and Marketplace Position Strengthened by a Number of Recent Key Events:\nAcquired the U.S. and Canadian rights to MACRILEN in January 2018. In conjunction, completed a public offering of ordinary shares raising net proceeds of $33.3 million and amended the Company’s existing senior credit facility with CRG LP to increase total potential borrowing from $50 million to $100 million. Completed a public offering of ordinary shares in October 2017, raising net proceeds of $23.4 million. Company added to the Russell 3000®Index in June 2017 and the NASDAQ Biotech Index in December 2017.\nStrongbridge will host an Investor and Analyst Day in New York City on Thursday, April 5, 2018 in which management and external opinion leaders will discuss the Company's clinical development progress and commercial priorities for 2018.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, basic and diluted net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders on a GAAP basis was $18.7 million, or $0.47 per share, compared to a basic net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of $16.0 million, or $0.71 per share, for the same period in 2016. Net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was higher than the same period in 2016 primarily due to increased operating expenses associated with the commercialization of KEVEYIS, which was launched in April 2017, and an unrealized loss on the fair value of warrants, offset in part by net revenues recorded from KEVEYIS product sales and a non-cash impairment charge recorded in 2016 related to in-process research and development recorded for the veldoreotide program.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was $12.3 million, or $0.31 per share, compared to a non-GAAP basic net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of $6.0 million, or $0.27 per share, for the same period in 2016. The increase in non-GAAP net loss was primarily due to increased operating expenses associated with the commercialization of KEVEYIS, which was launched in April 2017, offset in part by net revenues recorded from KEVEYIS product sales.\nNon-GAAP net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017 excludes $1.3 million of non-cash intangible asset amortization, $1.3 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, $0.6 million of non-cash interest expense, $2.0 million of non-cash unrealized losses on fair value of warrants, and a $1.2 million non-cash income tax expense. Non-GAAP net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2016 excludes a $10.6 million non-cash intangible asset impairment charge, $1.1 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and a $1.7 million non-cash income tax benefit.\nAs a result of the April 2017 KEVEYIS launch, the Company recorded net revenues of $3.0 million and cost of goods sold of $0.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. No revenue or cost of goods sold was recognized for the same period of 2016.\nResearch and development expenses were $5.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $4.1 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase during the 2017 period was primarily due to the RECORLEV LOGICS clinical trial.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $10.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $3.6 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase during the 2017 period was primarily due to costs incurred to establish the commercial and corporate infrastructure necessary to support the launch and ongoing commercialization of KEVEYIS.\nFull-Year 2017 Financial Results\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, basic and diluted net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders on a GAAP basis was $113.5 million, or $3.11 per share, compared to a basic net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of $48.6 million, or $2.26 per share, for the same period in 2016. The net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 included $54.4 million in charges consisting of a non-cash unrealized loss of $30.2 million on the fair value of the Company’s warrant liability, a non-cash impairment charge of $20.7 million related to in-process research and development recorded for the veldoreotide program, and a loss of $3.5 million on the early extinguishment of debt that was repaid in July 2017 in connection with establishing a new credit facility. The net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 included non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of $15.8 million. Net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was also higher than the same period in 2016 due to increased operating expenses associated with the commercialization of KEVEYIS, which was launched in April 2017, offset in part by net revenues recorded from KEVEYIS product sales.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was $47.9 million, or $1.31 per share, compared to a non-GAAP basic net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of $31.4 million, or $1.46 per share, for the same period in 2016. The increase in non-GAAP net loss was primarily due to increased operating expenses associated with the commercialization of KEVEYIS, which was launched in April 2017, offset in part by net revenues recorded from KEVEYIS product sales and lower research and development expenses.\nNon-GAAP net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 excludes $5.0 million of non-cash intangible asset amortization, a $20.7 million non-cash intangible asset impairment charge, $5.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, $30.2 million of non-cash unrealized losses on fair value of warrants, $2.8 million of non-cash interest and debt extinguishment expense, and $1.6 million of non-cash income tax expense. Non-GAAP net loss for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 excludes $15.8 million of non-cash intangible asset impairment charges, $4.6 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, $0.6 million of non-cash unrealized gains on fair value of warrants, and a $2.6 million non-cash income tax benefit.\nAs a result of the April 2017 KEVEYIS launch, the Company recorded net revenues of $7.0 million and cost of goods sold of $1.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. No revenue or cost of goods sold was recognized for the same period of 2016.\nResearch and development expenses were $17.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $20.0 million for the same period in the prior year. The decrease during the 2017 period was primarily due to a planned decrease in development activity for veldoreotide, and decreased development spend related to programs discontinued during 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $36.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $14.9 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase during the 2017 period was primarily due to costs incurred to establish the necessary commercial and corporate infrastructure to support the launch and ongoing commercialization of KEVEYIS.\nStrongbridge had $57.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $40.0 million in outstanding debt as of December 31, 2017, compared to $66.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $20.0 million in outstanding debt as of December 31, 2016. After adjusting for the net proceeds of the debt and equity financings completed in the first quarter of 2018 and the costs to acquire MACRILEN in January 2018, Strongbridge had pro forma cash and cash equivalents of $110.6 million and pro forma outstanding debt of $85.0 million as of December 31, 2017. The Company believes the combination of existing cash resources and anticipated additional borrowings available under its credit facility will provide sufficient cash resources under its current operating plan, which includes the commercial launch of MACRILEN and the potential U.S. regulatory approval and launch of RECORLEV, to achieve consistent positive cash flows from operating activities.\nConference Call Information\nStrongbridge will host a conference call on Monday, March 12 at 8:30 a.m. ET.

We believe this is a useful measure for investors because such exclusion facilitates comparison to peer companies who also provide similar non-GAAP disclosures and is reflective of how management internally manages the business.\n(c) The unrealized gain or loss on fair value of warrants are excluded due to the nature of this charge, which is non-cash and related primarily to the effect of changes in the company’s stock price at a point in time.

We believe such exclusion facilitates an understanding of the effects of the debt service obligations on the Company’s liquidity and comparisons to peer group companies, and is reflective of how management internally manages the business.\n(e) The effect of non-cash tax expense or benefit related to valuation allowance adjustments of the deferred income tax asset is excluded because of its non-recurring nature. We believe such exclusion facilitates investor’s ability to more accurately compare our operating results to those of our peer companies.\nSource:Strongbridge Biopharma plc",
