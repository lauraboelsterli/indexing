    "text": "(all amounts in US dollars, unless otherwise noted)\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ero Copper Corp. (TSX:ERO) (“Ero” or the “Company”) today announced its financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Management will host a call tomorrow, Thursday March 29, 2018, at 11:30 a.m. Eastern to discuss the results. Dial in details for the conference call can be found near the end of this news release.\nHIGHLIGHTS\nFourth quarter copper production of 5,334 tonnes and 2017 full year copper production of 20,133, exceeding production forecast by over 1,100 tonnes of copper; Generated $31.4 million and $52.9 million in EBITDA * (Adjusted EBITDA * of $12.0 million and $28.2 million) during the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2017, respectively; Fourth quarter C1 Cash Costs * of $1.54 per pound of copper and 2017 full year C1 Cash Costs * of $1.45 per pound of copper; Net income attributable to owners of the Company of $19.5 million and $22.5 million ($0.24 and $0.34 per share on a diluted basis) during the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2017, respectively; Ended the fourth quarter with strong cash position of $53.3 million; and, Significantly improved net debt position of $85.9 million as at December 31, 2017.\n“2017 was an extraordinary year for the Company and our shareholders. From restarting full operations in February, through to our successful initial public offering in October and the additional $25.6 million debt reduction at year-end, we were able to execute many of our primary corporate objectives for the year. At the same time, continued outperformance of our operations, including bringing forward the first production of the high-grade Vermelhos Mine has firmly placed the Company on solid footing thereby allowing us to prioritize efforts on our aggressive exploration programs that underpin our organic growth strategy” commented Noel Dunn, Executive Chairman of Ero.\n“At Pilar and Surubim, we have continued to optimize mine sequencing, focusing on lowering dilution and improving the quality of every tonne mined and sent to the mill, as well as advancing development (and exploration) to the known high-grade areas of the Pilar Mine,” added David Strang, President & CEO of Ero. “At Vermelhos, underground mine development has continued to outpace our expectations with 1,717 meters of total development completed during 2017, including 841 meters of primary ramp development. Underground infrastructure has now been completed to the top of the first production level of the main Vermelhos ore body. While we are maintaining our outlook for start-up of Vermelhos late in the fourth quarter of 2018, we are actively looking at opportunities to further advance this timeline. In 2018, we expect production to be biased towards the second half of the year as we begin production from Vermelhos as well as resequencing of Pilar and Surubim.”\nOn exploration, the results achieved to date both within and adjacent to, the Pilar and Vermelhos mines, including the recently announced new discovery at the Pilar Mine (North Extension), highlight our efforts on near-mine resource and reserve development. The results reinforce our confidence in the longer-term production potential from our existing operations by following extensions that were never previously explored or never followed up.”\n“As we look forward to 2018, our exploration efforts will gradually expand to include more aggressive regional step-out exploration in support of our 24,000 line-kilometer airborne geophysical survey designed to target high-grade mineralization throughout the Curaçá Valley.”\n* EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and C1 Cash Cost of copper produced (per lb) are non-IFRS measures – see the Notes section of this press release for a discussion on non-IFRS Measures\nOPERATIONS, EXPLORATION & CORPORATE HIGHLIGHTS\nMining & Milling Operations – high-grade production growth During the fourth quarter 2017, 444.3 thousand tonnes (“ kt ”) of ore was mined at a combined grade of 1.36% copper, comprising of 225.0 kt of ore grading 2.03% copper from underground operations and 219.3 kt of ore grading 0.68% from open pit operations; During the fourth quarter 2017, 452.4 kt of ore was processed at an average grade of 1.36% copper resulting in 5,334 tonnes of copper production after metallurgical recoveries that averaged 86.9% over the period; During the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017, 1.8 million tonnes of ore was processed at an average grade of 1.31% copper, at average metallurgical recoveries of 86.8%, to produce 20,133 tonnes of copper in concentrate; 5,448 and 19,719 tonnes of copper in concentrate sold during the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2017, respectively; Vermelhos Mine Development – continued advancement at above-forecast rates During the fourth quarter 2017, total development of 821 meters completed, including 306 meters of primary ramp development, 445 meters of secondary development and 71 meters of auxiliary ramp development to access the UG1 Target; and, Total development completed during the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017 of 1,717 meters, including 841 meters of primary ramp development since May 2017 at an average rate of 105 meters per month. Exploration Activities – advancing several new discoveries towards production Pilar District Exploration activities predominately focused on the new discovery within the North Extension and the high-grade infill drilling program within the “Deepening Zone”, both located within, or adjacent to existing Pilar underground mine infrastructure. Several significant intercepts highlighting these discoveries were previously reported including 43.1 meters grading 1.70% (including 19.0 meters grading 2.49% copper) at the North Extension. Vermelhos District Exploration activities remain focused on infill drilling required for stope definition and detailed mine planning, with several significant intercepts including 15.8 meters grading 8.84% copper, confirming the high-grade nature of the Vermelhos mine. As the infill drill program nears completion, drilling will refocus towards exploration of new targets and down dip extensions of the main Vermelhos ore bodies to the north. Corporate Highlights – Reduction in consolidated total debt and improved net debt position During the fourth quarter, the Company purchased at a discount senior secured notes of the Company’s subsidiary, Mineração Caraíba S.A. (“MCSA”), with the face amount of US$75.6 million. The Company financed the purchase through a US$50 million senior secured non-revolving credit facility with The Bank of Nova Scotia and recognized a US$25.6 million reduction in total consolidated debt. Please refer to the Company’s press release dated December 21, 2017 for additional information. A significantly improved net debt position of $85.9 million as result of the debt repurchase and proceeds from the initial public offering.\nOPERATING AND FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\n3 months\nended 3 months\nended Year\nended Period\nended December 31,\n2017 December\n31, 2016 [1] December 31,\n2017 December\n31, 2016 [1] Operating Highlights (MCSA Operations) Ore Processed (tonnes) 452,371 n/a 1,771,209 n/a Grade (% Cu) 1.36 n/a 1.31 n/a Cu Production (tonnes) 5,334 n/a 20,133 n/a Cu Production (lbs) 11,759,857 n/a 44,384,986 n/a Concentrate Grade (% Cu) 35.2 n/a 35.2 n/a Recovery (%) 86.9 n/a 86.8 n/a Concentrate Sales (tonnes) 15,577 n/a 56,341 n/a Cu Sold in Concentrate\n(tonnes) 5,448 n/a 19,719 n/a Cu Sold in Concentrate (lbs) 12,010,770 n/a 43,472,902 n/a C1 Cash cost of copper produced (per lb) [2]\n1.54\nn/a 1.45\nn/a Financial Highlights ($millions, except per share amounts) Revenues $ 37.8 n/a $ 115.4\nn/a Gross profit (loss) $ 5.8 n/a $ 12.9\nn/a EBITDA $ 31.4 ($2.2) $ 52.9\n($2.2) Adjusted EBITDA $ 12.0 ($5.4) $ 28.2\n($5.4) Cash flow from (used in) operations $ 11.2 ($8.6) $ 21.2\n($8.7) Net income (loss) attributable to owners of the Company $ 19.5 ($2.7) $ 22.5\n($3.0) Net income (loss) per share attributable to owners of the Company - Basic $ 0.28 $(0.19) $ 0.40\n$(0.44) - Diluted $ 0.24 $(0.19) $ 0.34\n$(0.44) Cash and Cash Equivalents $ 51.1 $18.3 $ 51.1\n$18.3 Working Capital (Deficit) [2] $ 42.6 ($129.3) $ 42.6\n($129.3) Net Debt [2] ($ 85.9 ) $(143.8) ($ 85.9\n) ($143.8) Footnotes\n[1] ERO was incorporated on May 16, 2016.

The Company utilizes certain non-IFRS measures, including C1 cash cost of copper produced (per lb), EBITDA, net debt and working capital, which are not measures recognized under IFRS. The Company believes that these measures, together with measures determined in accordance with IFRS, provide investors with an improved ability to evaluate the underlying performance of the Company. Non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS, and therefore they may not be comparable to similar measures employed by other companies. The data is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS.\nC1 Cash Cost of copper produced (per lb.)\nC1 cash cost of copper produced (per lb) is the sum of production costs, net of capital expenditure development costs and by-product credits, divided by the copper pounds produced. C1 cash costs reported by the Company exclude treatment, refining charges and offsite costs. By-product credits are calculated based on actual precious metal sales (net of treatment costs) during the period divided by the total pounds of copper produced during the period. C1 cash cost of copper produced per pound is a non-IFRS measure used by the Company to manage and evaluate operating performance of the Company’s operating mining unit, and is widely reported in the mining industry as benchmarks for performance, but does not have a standardized meaning and is disclosed in addition to IFRS measures.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)\nEBITDA represents earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA includes further adjustments for non-recurring items and items not indicative to the future operating performance of the Company. The Company believes EBIDTA and adjusted EBIDTA are appropriate supplemental measures of debt service capacity and performance of its operations.\nAdjusted EBIDTA was calculated by removing the following income statement items:\nGain on debt settlement Foreign exchange gain (loss)\nWorking capital\nWorking capital is determined based on current assets and current liabilities as reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company uses working capital as a measure of the Company’s short-term financial health and operating efficiency. The following table provides a calculation of working capital based on amounts presented in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nNet Debt\nNet debt is determined based on cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and loans and borrowings as reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company uses net debt as a measure of the Company’s ability to pay down it’s debt.\nCONFERENCE CALL DETAILS\nThe Company will hold a conference call on Thursday, March 29, 2018 at 11:30am Eastern time (8:30am Pacific time) to discuss these results.\nDate: Thursday, March 29, 2018 Time: 11:30 am Eastern time (8:30 am Pacific time) Dial in: North America: 1-800-319-4610, International: +1-604-638-5340\nplease dial in 5-10 minutes prior and ask to join the call Replay North America: 1-800-319-6413, International: +1-604-638-9010 Replay Passcode: 2136 This release should be read in conjunction with the complete audited consolidated financial statements and management’s discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017 available on the Company’s website www.erocopper.com\nABOUT ERO COPPER CORP\nEro Copper Corp, headquartered in Vancouver, B.C., is focused on copper production growth from the Vale do Curaçá Property, located in Bahia, Brazil.
