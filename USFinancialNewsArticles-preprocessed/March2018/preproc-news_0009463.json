    "text": "0 COMMENTS Penske Media Corp., the owner of the Hollywood trade publications Variety and Deadline, has acquired SheKnows Media to expand its audience among women with a network of female-focused websites and a popular conference business.\nThe deal encompasses all of the brands owned by SheKnows Media, including SheKnows.com, a parenting, health and food website; Stylecaster, a fashion-forward website aimed at trendsetters; and HelloFlo, a website focused on women’s health. It also includes BlogHer, an events business aimed at independent entrepreneurs, influencers and brand marketers.\nThe companies wouldn’t disclose financial terms of the deal.\nSheKnows Media is the latest media company to change hands in an industry ripe for consolidation. As Facebook and Google continue to attract an ever-larger share of digital advertising, media companies are under pressure to expand their audiences in order to compete with the scale wielded by the massive tech platforms.\nIn an interview, SheKnows Media Chief Executive Philippe Guelton said his company complements Penske Media’s existing audiences and helps Penske Media branch out to more consumers who will attract different advertisers such as consumer-packaged goods marketers. \n“A fundamental component of our brand is our orientation toward encouraging women leaders,” said Samantha Skey, SheKnows Media’s president and chief revenue officer. “That’s an area that is burgeoning and growing.”\nSheKnows Media is the latest acquisition for Penske Media, which bought a majority stake in the owner of pop-culture magazine Rolling Stone for north of $50 million in December. Penske Media, which owns WWD and recently purchased the fashion publication FashInvest and a majority stake in the luxury magazine Robb Report, is seeking to add to its holdings at a time of profound disruption for the media business, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nMr. Guelton said SheKnows Media is profitable and grew its revenue by 30% in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the same period a year earlier, largely owing to growth in its events and advertising businesses. Ad revenue grew by a double-digit percentage, despite a downturn in directly sold advertisements, he said.\nGreat Hill Partners, the Boston-based private-equity firm that owned SheKnows Media, was interested in selling despite that growth, Mr. Guelton said. And at a time when scale is critical, it’s better for SheKnows Media to be part of a larger company, he said.\nDisplay advertising comprises about 65% of SheKnows Media’s revenue, Mr. Guelton said. Events make up about 15%, and most of the remaining 20% comes from influencer marketing.\nMr. Guelton and Ms. Skey will remain with SheKnows Media as part of the deal. The company plans to continue operating all of its websites and has no plans to cut staff.",
