We delivered impressive gains in RevPAR and guest satisfaction scores, took back market share, and continued to build momentum as we executed on our key strategic initiatives to deliver a consistent product, to consistently deliver an outstanding guest experience and to drive engagement with our brand,” said Keith A. Cline, President and Chief Executive Officer of La Quinta. “We completed the significant renovation of 27 owned hotels in our repositioning program and are encouraged by their early performance as the properties are being re-introduced within their respective markets. We also added to an already-strong pipeline that will allow La Quinta to further expand its reach into new markets and take advantage of the brand’s unique growth opportunity in the industry. We achieved all of this despite the disruption we experienced in the fourth quarter due to damage caused by the hurricanes, especially in Florida where Hurricane Irma had, and continues to have, a significant impact on our business.”\nMr. Cline continued, “Looking ahead, 2018 is going to be a year of realizing the benefits of our investments, hurricane recovery, and transitioning the brand. As we progress through the year, we will have more repositioned hotels with construction completed and ramping up as they are reintroduced to their markets – building on the positive early results we have already seen. Rooms out of service at hurricane-impacted hotels will come back on line repaired and refreshed. And we are continuing our work to effect the spin-off of our owned hotel assets as CorePoint Lodging as well as the sale of our franchise and management business to Wyndham Hotel Group. These are exciting opportunities for the La Quinta brand, which we believe will continue to grow and thrive, and for our owned hotel portfolio as it moves forward as CorePoint Lodging, all of which we believe will yield long-term benefits to our stakeholders.”\nFinancial Overview\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company grew system-wide comparable RevPAR 3.4 percent over the same period of 2016, driven by 8.1 percent growth in its franchise locations and a 2.0 percent decline in its owned hotels. For the full year 2017, the Company grew system-wide comparable RevPAR 2.9 percent over 2016, driven by 5.3 percent growth in its franchise locations and 20 basis points of growth in its owned hotels. Excluding the impact of the owned hotels undergoing significant renovation as part of the repositioning effort and the owned hotels affected by Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, system-wide comparable RevPAR increased 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter and 4.4 percent for the full year 2017. The Company grew franchise and other fee-based revenue 5.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, and 7.6 percent for the full year, over the same periods of 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company reported net income of $121.2 million, including approximately $132 million of income tax benefit related to tax reform, and Adjusted Net Loss of $6.4 million. Net Income per Share was $1.03, including approximately $1.13 related to changes in tax legislation, and Adjusted Loss per Share was $0.05. For the full year 2017, the Company reported net income of $152.0 million and Adjusted Net Income of $34.4 million. Net Income per Share was $1.30 and Adjusted Earnings per Share was $0.29.\nTotal Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $60.2 million and for the full year 2017 was $326.9 million. Total Adjusted EBITDA in both periods, as compared to the prior year periods, was affected by the sale of owned hotels in 2016 and early 2017. These hotels contributed revenues of approximately $3.0 million and Total Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, and approximately $29 million of revenues and Total Adjusted EBITDA of $9 million for the full year 2016, which did not recur in 2017. Total Adjusted EBITDA was also impacted by competitive wage pressures as well as an elevated presence of third-party booking agents in the Company’s channel mix as compared to the prior year.\nHurricanes Harvey and Irma had a significant impact on the Company’s business, ultimately lifting the performance at the franchise hotels, but creating significant challenges for certain owned hotels, particularly those in Florida affected by Hurricane Irma. The positive impact of the hurricanes on the franchise hotels and the negative impact of the hurricanes on the owned hotels was greater in the fourth quarter than originally anticipated. The Company estimates that the impact of the hurricanes on fourth quarter results was a reduction of approximately $6 million in Total Adjusted EBITDA.\nThe Company’s system-wide portfolio, as of December 31, 2017, is located across 48 states in the U.S., as well as in Canada, Mexico, Honduras and Colombia. The portfolio includes:\nDecember 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 # of hotels # of rooms # of hotels # of rooms Owned (1) 316 40,400 321 41,000 Joint Venture 1 200 1 200 Franchised (2) 585 47,800 566 46,000 Totals 902 88,400 888 87,200 (1) As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, Owned included three hotels (400 rooms) and five hotels (700 rooms), respectively, designated as assets held for sale, which are subject to definitive purchase agreements\n(2) As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, Franchised included three hotels (400 rooms) and five hotels (600 rooms), respectively, under temporary franchise agreements related to formerly owned hotels which are in the process of leaving the system\nThe results of operations for the Company for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 include the following highlights ($ in thousands, except per share amounts):\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 (1) 2016 (1) % Change Total Revenue $ 214,279 $ 222,616 -3.7 % Franchise and Management Segment Adj.

For the full year 2017, the Company opened a total of 36 franchised hotels, including one temporary franchise hotel, and had 17 terminations including two temporary hotels, resulting in a net increase of 19 open and operating franchised hotels. The elevated level of franchise terminations was in keeping with the Company’s overall strategy to drive consistency in its product. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had a pipeline of 261 franchised hotels totaling approximately 24,500 rooms, to be located in the United States, Mexico, Colombia, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Chile, and El Salvador.\nOwned Hotel Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had three hotels held for sale. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company closed on the sale of one hotel and entered into an agreement to sell an owned hotel located in Oakbrook Terrace, Illinois. In addition, during the fourth quarter, construction progressed on the portfolio of approximately 50 owned hotels which the Company believes have the opportunity to be repositioned upward within their markets in order to drive enhanced guest experience and revenue growth. As of the end of 2017, 27 of these hotels had completed the construction phase of the project and are now in the process of being reintroduced to their markets with encouraging early results.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $1.7 billion of outstanding indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 4.5%, including the impact of an interest rate swap.

The Company believes this financial information provides meaningful supplemental information. The Company further believes the presentation of Total Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share provides meaningful information because it excludes the impact of certain special items and/or certain items that are not expected to have an ongoing effect on its operations. This represents how management views the business and reviews its operating performance. It is also used by management when publicly providing the business outlook.\n“EBITDA” and “Total Adjusted EBITDA.” Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure in many industries. The Company adjusts EBITDA when evaluating its performance because the Company believes that the adjustment for certain items, such as restructuring and acquisition transaction expenses, impairment charges related to long-lived assets, non-cash equity-based compensation, discontinued operations, and other items not indicative of ongoing operating performance, provides useful supplemental information to management and investors regarding its ongoing operating performance. The Company believes that EBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors about it and its financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) EBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA are among the measures used by the Company’s management team to evaluate its operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions; and (ii) EBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts, investors, lenders and other interested parties as a common performance measure to compare results or estimate valuations across companies in the Company’s industry.\nEBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered either in isolation or as a substitute for net (loss) income, cash flow or other methods of analyzing the Company’s results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nEBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company’s working capital needs;\nEBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the Company’s interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on its indebtedness;\nEBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the Company’s tax expense or the cash requirements to pay its taxes;\nEBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;\nEBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the impact on earnings or changes resulting from matters that the Company considers not to be indicative of its future operations;\nalthough depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and\nother companies in the Company’s industry may calculate EBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nBecause of these limitations, EBITDA and Total Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as discretionary cash available to the Company to reinvest in the growth of its business or as measures of cash that will be available to the Company to meet its obligations.\n“Total Adjusted EBITDA margin” represents the ratio of Total Adjusted EBITDA to total revenues.\n“Adjusted operating income (loss)” represents the Company’s reported operating income (loss), adjusted to exclude the impact of items not indicative of ongoing operating performance. Adjusted operating income (loss) is presented to provide additional perspective on underlying trends in the Company’s operating results.\n“Adjusted Net Income” and “Adjusted Earnings Per Share” are not recognized terms under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), earnings per share, or other measures of financial performance or liquidity derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, the Company’s definitions of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share are included to assist investors in performing meaningful comparisons of past, present and future operating results and as a means of highlighting the results of the Company’s ongoing operations in a comparable format.\nTOTAL ADJUSTED EBITDA NON-GAAP RECONCILIATION (unaudited, in thousands) Three Months\nEnded\nDecember 31,\n2017 Three Months\nEnded\nDecember 31,\n2016 Year
