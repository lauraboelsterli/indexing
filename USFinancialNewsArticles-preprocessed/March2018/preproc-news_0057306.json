    "text": "March 31, 2018 / 8:31 AM / Updated 3 hours ago Saudi forces say Houthi missile intercepted over Saudi city - state media Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nRIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi air defence forces intercepted a missile fired by Houthi fighters in neighbouring Yemen at the southern Saudi city of Najran on Saturday, the Saudi-led coalition said. \nIn a statement carried by state news agency SPA the coalition said that according to initial findings an Indian resident was injured by falling debris after the missile was intercepted. \nThe Houthi-run Saba news agency earlier said a missile was fired at a Saudi National Guard base in Najran, and that it had led to “losses in the ranks of the enemy and its military equipment”. \nThe Iran-aligned Houthis have launched scores of missiles at the kingdom since the coalition intervened in Yemen’s civil war in 2015 after the Houthis drove Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into exile. \nLast week, Saudi air defence forces intercepted a flurry of missiles, and falling debris caused the first death in the capital Riyadh. \nSaudi Arabia accuses Iran of supplying missile parts and expertise to the Houthis, who have taken over the Yemeni capital Sanaa and other parts of the country. Tehran and the Houthis deny the charge. Writing by Ghaida Ghantous; Editing by Andrew Bolton",
