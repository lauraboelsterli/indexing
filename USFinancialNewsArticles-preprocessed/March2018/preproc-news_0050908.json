    "text": "(Adds background, shares)\nMarch 27 (Reuters) - Britain’s largest electricals and mobile phone retailer, Dixons Carphone Plc, named on Tuesday cycle retailer Halfords Group Plc finance chief Jonny Mason as its finance director.\nDixons Carphone’s current finance chief, Humphrey Singer, is set to leave the company at the end of this month to join clothing and food retailer Marks & Spencer.\nMason’s is the second top executive appointment in a span of two months after the company said in January that its CEO and finance director had resigned.\nAlex Baldock, the former chief executive of Shop Direct, was named Dixons Carphone CEO in January, replacing Sebastian James, who had quit to run the Boots retail chain in the UK.\nIn January, Dixon Carphone reported a 6 percent rise in underlying revenue for the 10 weeks to Jan. 6, beating analysts’ forecast, as it expanded market share in electricals and on strong demand for the new iPhone.\nShares of Dixons Carphone were up about 1 percent in morning trading on the London Stock Exchange.
