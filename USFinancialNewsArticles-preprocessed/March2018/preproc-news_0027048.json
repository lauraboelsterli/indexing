    "text": "March 12, 2018 / 11:13 PM / Updated 11 hours ago Tennis-Federer cruises past Krajinovic at Indian Wells Reuters Staff 2 Min Read March 12 (Reuters) - World number one Roger Federer needed less than an hour to dispatch Filip Krajinovic at the BNP Paribas Open in California on Monday, mixing overpowering serves and pinpoint groundstrokes to advance to the fourth round. Playing for a third consecutive day due to weather delays in Indian Wells, the 36-year-old Swiss showed no sign of wear en route to a 6-2 6-1 thrashing of the Serbian in the pair’s first ever meeting. Federer, who had looked slightly off his game in his rain-disrupted third round match against Federico Delbonis, was his dominant self on Monday, winning 89 percent of his first service points while cracking six aces to just one double fault. Krajinovic had no answer for Federer’s serve or relentless return game and ended up winning just 31 of the match’s 93 points. With rivals Rafa Nadal, Stan Wawrinka and Andy Murray electing not to enter the tournament, and Novak Djokovic and Kei Nishikori both eliminated, the path appears clear for the Swiss to win a record sixth Indian Wells title. But first he will have to get past France’s Jeremy Chardy, who upset his countryman Adrian Mannarino earlier on Monday. Reporting by Rory Carroll in Los Angeles; Editing by Ian Ransom",
