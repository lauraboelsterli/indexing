    "text": "ABUJA, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects that Nigeria will “muddle through” with its economic policies in the medium term, according to a report seen by Reuters on Wednesday.\nThe lender warned that “comprehensive and coherent” economic policies “remain urgent and must not be delayed by approaching elections and recovering oil prices”.\nThe IMF added that while the broader economy is slowly exiting recession, real gross domestic product per capita is falling.
