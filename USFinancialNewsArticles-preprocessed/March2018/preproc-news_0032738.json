(Nasdaq:AMRS), the industrial bioscience company, today announced preliminary unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\n“We’ve completed another record year and a very strong fourth quarter. We’ve exceeded our key targets for 2017 and have started 2018 with continued strong growth in revenues and operating performance,” said John Melo, Amyris President & CEO. “We have completed the transformation of our company into one of the leading global companies focused on making our planet healthier. We have organized around three core markets – Performance Health and Wellness, Clean Skin-Care and Pure Flavor & Fragrance Ingredients. Each of these markets is delivering strong, profitable growth underpinned by the most advantaged technology in the sector. We are making good for humanity and our planet with No Compromise® products. We are very pleased with our performance and expect another very strong year delivering continued market disruption with our partners.”\nKey Highlights\nOther key operating and development highlights during the fourth quarter of 2017 and more recently included:\nExpanded strategic alliance with DSM through the sale of Amyris Brasil Ltda. and established long-term manufacturing partnership for Amyris’s high-volume products.\nSuccessfully launched Biossance into SEPHORA Canada stores, with SEPHORA U.S. sales during the year overall contributing to a greater than 650% increase in total 2017 Biossance retail sales over 2016.\nIntroduced pharmaceutical grade Neossance® Squalane USP through our Aprinnova joint venture opening new markets among FDA regulated products such as topical and dermal applications, including therapeutic skin creams and ointments.\nAnnounced the award of two grants, valued in aggregate at approximately $25 million, to accelerate innovation and to enable the company to further extend its leadership position in the industrial biotechnology sector. These grants are focused on furthering Amyris’s artificial intelligence (AI) and information platform and for the development of a novel isoprenoid pharmaceutical application.\nFinancial Performance (preliminary unaudited)\nValue share will be classified in the license and royalty line item in the consolidated statement of operations instead of as part of product sales to better reflect the company’s current business model and provide more transparency as that portion of overall revenue grows. Prior-year amounts have been reclassified to conform to that presentation.\nFourth Quarter 2017\nGAAP revenue for the fourth quarter 2017 was $80.6 million, compared with $22.2 million for the fourth quarter 2016. The company recognized approximately $57.3 million of license and royalty revenues from the multi-element license and value share agreement with DSM. As a result, license and royalty revenues contributed $57.7 million and were up from $0.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Product sales were $13.4 million for fourth-quarter 2017 compared with $11.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nSales, general and administrative expenses were $18.8 million for fourth-quarter 2017 compared with $12.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily reflecting increased headcount, sales and marketing expenses to support Biossance growth, ASC 606 implementation costs, and costs related to the Amyris Brasil transaction. Research and development expenses of $12.7 million for the quarter were down from $14.0 million from the year-ago period due to lower overhead allocation charges incurred in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nGAAP net loss attributable to Amyris common stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.0 million, or $0.17 per basic and diluted share, compared with a GAAP net loss attributable to Amyris common stockholders for fourth-quarter 2016 of $48.8 million, or $2.67 per basic and diluted share. The net loss calculation included cumulative dividends on preferred stock. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $27.0 million, or $0.61 per basic and diluted share. This excluded cumulative dividends on preferred stock, a gain on divestiture, impairment of property, plant and equipment, loss on change in fair value of derivatives, stock-based compensation, depreciation, and gain on extinguishment of debt. This compared with a non-GAAP net loss of $36.0 million, or $1.98 per basic and diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFiscal Year 2017\nGAAP revenue for fiscal year 2017 was $143.4 million, compared with $67.2 million for 2016. License and royalty revenue contributed $64.5 million, compared with $15.8 million for 2016 primarily due to the DSM transaction. Product sales were $42.4 million, compared with 2016 product sales of $25.5 million driven primarily by increases in the company’s clean skin care and health and wellness segments as well as higher performance materials sales.\nFiscal 2017 selling, general and administrative expenses were $63.0 million, up from $47.7 million for 2016 reflecting costs related to the company’s Nenter partnership, ASC 606 implementation costs, and costs related to the Amyris Brasil transaction, as well as higher spend to support revenue growth. Research and development expenses for 2017 were $56.8 million, compared with $51.4 million for 2016 reflecting costs related to the company’s Ginkgo Bioworks partnership and a significant increase in collaboration activity.\nGAAP net loss attributable to Amyris common stockholders for fiscal year 2017 was $98.4 million, or $3.05 per basic and diluted share. Included in the 2017 net loss were several large non-cash items, including loss from extinguishment of debt and a non-cash gain from changes in the fair value of derivatives, cumulative dividends on preferred stock, stock based compensation expense and depreciation. Also included in the net loss was a gain on divestiture of Amyris Brasil Ltda. This compared to a fiscal year 2016 net loss of $97.3 million, or $6.12 per basic and $6.55 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net loss, excluding the non-cash items mentioned, was $72.1 million, or $2.59 per basic and diluted share and compared to a non-GAAP net loss for 2016 of $119.5 million, or $7.52 per basic share.\nCash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash at December 31, 2017 was $60.1 million, compared with $32.9 million at December 31, 2016.\nFINANCIAL RESULTS AND NON-GAAP INFORMATION\nTo supplement our financial results and guidance presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures that we believe are helpful in understanding our results.
