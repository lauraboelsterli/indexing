    "text": "Ideas Accenture trims profit margin forecast as spending grows, stock dives Consulting services firm Accenture trimmed its yearly forecast for profit margins, overshadowing quarterly results that comfortable topped Wall Street estimates. The firm now expectes fiscal 2018 operating margin profit as a proportion of revenue at 14.8 percent, which is consistent with results from fiscal 2017 but lower than expectations. Accenture has spent more than $3 billion over the last three, years nearly half of it in fiscal 2017 on some 70 acquisitions, to boost its digital and cloud services in order to compete better with Cognizant and IBM. Published 1 Hour Ago Jussi Nukari | AFP | Getty Images People enter an Accenture office in downtown Helsinki, Finland. \nConsulting services firm Accenture trimmed its yearly forecast for profit margins, driving its stock down 6 percent on Thursday and overshadowing quarterly results that comfortably topped Wall Street targets. \nAccenture now expects fiscal 2018 operating margin profit as a proportion of revenue of 14.8 percent, a level consistent with results in fiscal 2017, but lower than the 10- to 30-basis-point expansion originally expected by the company. \nDublin-based Accenture flagged lower profits from services for healthcare and public service clients as well as higher spending as reasons for the revised forecast. \nThe company also said it expects operating margin to expand in the second half of the year. \n\"Operating margin was light of (Wall Street) expectations ... operating profit in the Health & Public Service sector has declined significantly,\" Atlantic Equities analyst Chris Hickey said. \nAccenture has spent more than $3 billion over the last three years, nearly half of it in fiscal 2017 on some 70 acquisitions, to boost its digital and cloud services in order to compete better with Cognizant and IBM . \nThose services helped Accenture grow net revenue by 15.2 percent to $9.59 billion in the second quarter ended Feb. 28, the biggest increase in at least five years. \nNet revenue also soared past analysts' average expectation of $9.31 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nThe digital and cloud services, which Accenture calls \"the New,\" also made up more than 55 percent of revenue, reaching a record level. \n\"'The New' is really impacting across the board,\" Chief Executive Pierre Nanterme said on a call with analysts. \nAccenture began investing in businesses such as digital marketing and cybersecurity about five years ago, compared with its peers that began a similar effort only one or two years back, said Wedbush Securities analyst Moshe Khatri. \nThe company forecast current-quarter revenue between $9.90 billion and $10.15 billion, well ahead of analysts' average estimate of $9.68 billion. \nNet income attributable to the company rose to $863.7 million in the second quarter, from $838.8 million a year earlier. Accenture reported earnings of $1.37 per share in the latest quarter. \nResults included a $137 million charge related to the new U.S. tax code. \nExcluding one-time items, the company earned $1.58 per share, topping market estimates of $1.49 per share.
