    "text": "57 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—White House chief of staff John Kelly said he regretted his handling of the departure of Rob Porter, whose resignation last month resulted in an overhaul of security-clearance rules and played an indirect part in the confusion over the rollout of President Donald Trump’s new trade tariffs .\nWhen Mr. Porter departed last month amid accusations of spousal abuse, the White House initially issued statements defending him and said incorrectly that a background check that contained details of the allegations was still in the hands of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The White House later revised its statements and conceded it had mishandled the incident . Mr. Porter has denied abusing his ex-wives.\n“We didn’t cover ourselves in glory in terms of how we handled that,” Mr. Kelly told reporters at the White House on Friday. “It was confusing.”\nMr. Kelly’s assessment on Friday differed from comments last month, when he told The Wall Street Journal that he wouldn’t have handled Mr. Porter’s situation any differently. “It was all done right,” Mr. Kelly said on Feb. 12, five days after Mr. Porter’s resignation.\nRead more\nJohn Kelly Orders End to Some Interim Security Clearances White House Offers Regrets About Handling of Rob Porter Allegations FBI Director’s Timeline of Porter Probe Contradicts White House White House Aide Resigns Amid Abuse Allegations Sign Up: Capital Journal Daybreak newsletter Mr. Kelly said Friday that at no point did he consider resigning over the episode. “I have absolutely nothing to even consider resigning over.”\nMr. Porter, as the staff secretary, was a top aide to Mr. Kelly and acted as a gatekeeper on trade issues. Mr. Porter had effectively isolated Peter Navarro, the head of the president’s trade council known for his hawkish views. With Mr. Porter gone, Mr. Navarro made a direct pitch for tariffs to Mr. Trump. The president then told Mr. Kelly that he wanted Mr. Navarro restored to a central role in the administration’s trade policy, a White House official said.\nMr. Trump on Thursday announced he would seek new tariffs on aluminum and steel, after the White House reversed itself twice on whether it would make such an announcement.\nIn his comments to reporters on Friday, Mr. Kelly also said he had been aware of issues with the White House security-clearance process for months. He joined the White House as chief of staff on July 29 and he said that his “eyes were opened” to the large number of staffers with interim clearances after he was on the job for about six weeks.\nHis review turned up “a couple spreadsheets worth of people” at the White House operating with interim security clearance after the first nine months of the Trump administration. He also found at least 35 officials who were inappropriately given top secret clearance.\n“Most of the people that are here at the White House have never worked in government before, so they wouldn’t have come out of a culture like I did for clearances, security clearances, how to handle security clearances,” Mr. Kelly said.\nA former four-star Marine general who also spent several years at the Department of Defense, Mr. Kelly said he was surprised at the different culture around security clearances at the White House.\n“The kind of things I was used to at DOD, in terms of the handling of classified material wasn’t up to the standards I’ve been used to,” Mr. Kelly said. “Nothing illegal, but it wasn’t quite up to the standards I was used to at DOD, administratively.”\nMr. Kelly also revisited the timeline for the resignation of Mr. Porter and what he knew when.\nMr. Kelly said that he immediately sought Mr. Porter’s resignation after hearing about the accusations on the evening of Feb. 6. “The mix-up came the next day,“ Mr. Kelly said. ”The next day, probably around 10 or 11 o’clock, somebody said Rob’s still in the building. My assumption was he was doing the checkout process.”\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Feb. 7 that there was no effective resignation date for Mr. Porter. Other White House officials said that Mr. Kelly had encouraged Mr. Porter to remain, which wasn’t disputed by press officials.\nAs part of the mix-up, FBI Director Christopher Wray publicly disputed the White House’s statements that Mr. Porter’s background check hadn’t been completed by the bureau. “Chris Wray was accurate,” Mr. Kelly said.\nThe chief of staff eventually issued a memo that overhauled the security clearance process, which resulted in the removal of interim security clearance for staffers whose status had been pending since June 1. That included senior adviser Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law, who now no longer has access to top secret information. The change has increased tension between Mr. Kushner and Mr. Kelly, according to White House officials.\nWrite to Michael C. Bender at Mike.Bender@wsj.com",
