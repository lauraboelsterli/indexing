    "text": "ALISO VIEJO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Smith Micro Software, Inc. ( NASDAQ: SMSI ), today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\n“I’m encouraged by the positive strides we made as a company in Fiscal 2017,” said William W. Smith, Jr., President and CEO of Smith Micro Software. “Building off our 2016 restructuring, we achieved some significant milestones, which included the launch of our SafePath ® Family platform with a Tier 1, U.S.-based carrier, and the implementation of significant product enhancements across our portfolio, all of which we expect to contribute to 2018 revenue growth.\n“We are entering 2018 with momentum. The company is well-capitalized and ready to maximize the significant revenue opportunities that lay ahead. As such, I expect to see revenues build throughout 2018, which will return us to positive cash flow and profitability.”\nFiscal Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results:\nSmith Micro Software reported revenue of $5.7 million for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $7.1 million reported in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nFourth quarter 2017 gross profit was $4.4 million, compared to $5.3 million reported in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 76 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 75 percent for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nGAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.2 million, or $0.01 loss per share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $3.7 million, or $0.30 loss per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNon-GAAP net loss (which excludes non-cash stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, loss on debt extinguishment, debt issuance and discount costs, impairment of long-lived assets, the reversal of restructuring reserves, and a normalized tax benefit) for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.7 million, or $0.05 loss per share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $1.8 million, or $0.15 loss per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nYear Ended 2017 Financial Results:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported revenue of $23.0 million, compared to $28.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGAAP gross profit was $17.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGAAP gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 78 percent for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 73 percent for the same period last year.\nGAAP net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $6.7 million, or $0.49 loss per share, compared to a GAAP net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $15.3 million, or $1.28 loss per share.\nNon-GAAP net loss (which excludes non-cash stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, loss on debt extinguishment, debt issuance and discount costs, impairment of long-lived assets, the reversal of restructuring reserves, and a normalized tax benefit) for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $3.5 million, or $0.26 loss per share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $8.6 million, or $0.72 loss per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nTotal cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 were $2.2 million.\nTo supplement our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company considers and has included in this press release certain non-GAAP financial measures, including a non-GAAP reconciliation of gross profit, income (loss) before taxes, net income (loss), and earnings (loss) per share in the presentation of financial results in this press release. Management believes this non-GAAP presentation may be more meaningful in analyzing our income generation and therefore has excluded the following non-cash items from GAAP earnings calculations: stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, fair value adjustments, and debt issuance and discount costs. Additionally, since we are in a cumulative loss position, a non-GAAP income tax benefit was computed using a 38 percent tax rate using the Company’s normalized combined U.S. federal, state, and foreign statutory tax rates less various tax adjustments. This presentation may be considered more indicative of our ongoing operational performance. The table below presents the differences between non-GAAP earnings and net loss on an absolute and per-share basis. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and the non-financial measures as reported by Smith Micro Software may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies.\nInvestor Conference Call:\nSmith Micro Software will hold an investor conference call today, March 14, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. EDT, to discuss the Company’s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 results.
