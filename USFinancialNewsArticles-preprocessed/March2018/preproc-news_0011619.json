Sharma, TRAI Secretary Sunil Kumar Gupta, Hinduja Group MD Ashok Mansukhani and other film industry officials at FICCI’s “Creative Future: Coronation of Digital Consumer” event in Mumbai. GMF: LIVECHAT - CHINA FOCUS Zhou Hao, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank, will break down all the recent developments in China, including economic data and China's Constitutional amendment that will allo Xi to stayin office indefinitely. All this just ahead of the China's NPC meet on March 8. Most analysts expect the NPC to again set a GDP growth target of around 6.5% for 2018, below last year's actual 6.9 percent growth, and continue the financial deleveraging and anti-pollution drive. Yet signs of more pronounced weakness in data could quickly shift the focus from reining in risks to supporting the economy.
