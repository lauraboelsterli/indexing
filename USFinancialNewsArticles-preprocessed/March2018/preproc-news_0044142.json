    "text": "PRISTINA/BELGRADE (Reuters) - Kosovo police fired tear gas on Monday to scatter hundreds of nationalist Serb protesters outside a round-table meeting on improving relations between Belgrade and Pristina, and briefly detained a hardline Serbian government official.\nThe incident occurred in the town of Mitrovica in a volatile, mainly minority Serb pocket of northern Kosovo still unreconciled to the independence a decade ago of the ethnic Albanian-majority country from Serbia.\nThe round table was part of a dialogue toward normalization Serbia is conducting with Kosovo, its former province that went to war against repressive Serbian rule in the late 1990s, to help fulfill conditions for European Union membership.\nBut shortly after the round table began, Marko Djuric, head of the Serbian government office on Kosovo, was detained by police because he had been banned from entering the country over nationalist remarks Pristina regarded as inflammatory.\nKosovo police also fired tear gas to disperse local Serbs who gathered outside the meeting venue in protest.\nDjuric was brought to the Kosovo capital Pristina in a police van and, booed by Kosovo Albanian onlookers, walked in handcuffs into the main police station, a Reuters witness said.\nBut shortly afterwards Djuric was taken to a border crossing and freed to cross back into Serbia.\nKosovo had sent special police units in the morning to the small Balkan state’s north to enforce an entry ban on Djuric and fellow hardline Defence Minister Aleksandar Vulin. Vulin heeded the ban and did not show up at the border.\nTwenty years after the ethnic Albanian uprising that eventually led to Kosovo’s statehood, some 50,000 Serbs have clung to homes in territory that remains politically loyal to Serbia and is largely in the grip of Serb criminal gangs.\nSerbia does not recognize the independence of Kosovo but is under pressure to normalize relations before it completes accession talks with the EU. But tensions remain high.\nOn Friday, Serbia cited security reasons in scrapping an international women’s handball match between that would have been the first between Serbia and Kosovo.\nKosovo won independence after NATO bombed Serbian security forces to halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanians from the region in a counter-insurgency campaign.\nThe landlocked country of 1.8 million people is recognized by 116 nations but is not a United Nations member because of objections from Serbia, some EU states, Russia and China.\nReporting by Fatos Bytyci and Aleksandar Vasovic; Editing by Ivana Sekularac and Mark Heinrich\n ",
