    "text": "HOUSTON, March 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- NCI Building Systems, Inc. (NYSE: NCS) (the \"Company\") announced today that its Board of Directors has authorized a new stock repurchase program for up to an aggregate of $50 million of the Company's outstanding common stock. As of January 28, 2018, the Company had repurchased approximately $46.7 million of its common stock (2.7 million shares) under the previously announced October 2017 stock repurchase program.\nMr. Donald R. Riley, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"Our Board of Directors and Management team remain committed to returning value to our shareholders, as well as the prudent management of our capital structure. We continue to generate strong cash flow from our operations and have three areas of focus for investing this capital â€“ funding our growth initiatives both organic and inorganic, repayment of debt and share repurchases. Over the last two years, we have utilized over $100 million of our cash flow to repurchase shares. We believe it is good corporate policy to continually have an approved repurchase program available.\"\nUnder the stock repurchase program, the Company may repurchase shares in open-market purchases in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations, including Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in privately negotiated purchases or otherwise. The Company may commence such repurchases immediately, subject to compliance with applicable securities laws. The Company may enter into a pre-arranged stock trading plan in accordance with the guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 to effectuate the Company's new stock repurchase plan. The Company expects to finance any repurchases from a combination of cash on hand and cash provided by operating activities. The timing and method of any repurchases, which will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, are subject to results of operations, financial conditions, cash requirements and other factors, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
