    "text": "11:04 AM EDT \nCrazy happened, which means Little Caesars is giving away free pizza . \nPizza chain Little Caesars launched the “If Crazy Happens” promotion to give away free hot-n-ready lunch combos if a #16 seed beat a #1 seed in the March Madness college basketball tournament. The combo include four slices of Little Caesars Deep! Deep! Dish pizza and a 20-ounce Pepsi product. \nAnd crazy happened Friday, March 16, when #16 seed University of Maryland-Baltimore County beat #1 seed Virginia, 74 to 54. The historic win may have thrown off some brackets, but it can also come with a free lunch. Because \"CRAZY HAPPENED\" with a #16 beating a #1 (!!!!), everyone in America gets a free #LittleCaesars Lunch Combo on Monday, April 2nd. \nCongratulations & see our OFFICIAL RULES for more details: https://t.co/vHuy8315ee pic.twitter.com/8KGbskGFxt \n— Little Caesars (@littlecaesars) March 17, 2018 \nTo get the deal, you have to place your order between 11:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. on April 2.
