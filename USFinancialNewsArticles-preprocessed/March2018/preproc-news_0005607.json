(NYSE: SBOW) (“SilverBow” or the “Company”) today announced operating and financial results for the fourth quarter 2017. Highlights include:\nNet production averaged 177 million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent per day (“Mmcfe/d”), exceeding the high end of guidance Oil and gas revenues of $58.7 million, a 20% increase from third quarter 2017 Lease operating expenses of $0.34/Mcfe compared to $0.41/Mcfe in the third quarter 2017 Net Income of $25.1 million, or $2.17 per diluted share compared to $1.12 in the third quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) of $42.0 million, a 35% increase from third quarter 2017 Year-end 2017 reserves of 1.0 Tcfe, up 38% from prior year with PV-10 growth of 82% to $805 million with a Standardized Measure of $732 million. For a reconciliation of PV-10 (non-GAAP) to Standardized Measure (GAAP), please see table in the back. Greater than 600% reserve replacement at a finding, development, and acquisition (FD&A) cost of $0.59/Mcfe Acquisition of an additional ~10,000 net acres during 4Q17 and ~36,500 net acres for the full year bringing total net acreage to over 100,000 in the Eagle Ford Sale of AWP Olmos non-core assets for $28.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 Full year 2018 capital expenditure guidance of $245 to $265 million with plan to have two drilling rigs active by end of first quarter 2018 Reaffirmed full year 2018 production guidance of 175 to 195 Mmcfe/d, an increase of 22% to 37% pro forma for divestitures\nManagement Comments\nSean Woolverton, SilverBow’s Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We finished 2017 with another strong quarter operationally, with both production and operating costs comparing favorably to our guidance. Fourth quarter production levels were driven by strong base production performance combined with bringing two additional net wells online in our southern Eagle Ford gas position as well as two net wells in Fasken. We continue to focus on driving efficiencies with a best-in-class cost structure in the basin as evidenced by lease operating expenses declining 17% on a per unit basis compared to third quarter levels. This strong operational performance generated adjusted EBITDA of $42.0 million, an increase of 35% compared to the third quarter.”\nWoolverton commented further, “I’m also pleased to announce we reported reserve growth of 38% to just over 1.0 trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent compared to year-end 2016 levels. We believe we have significant potential to grow proved reserves within our existing asset base as we strategically develop our Eagle Ford acreage. Additionally, after adding over approximately 36,000 acres to our Eagle Ford position in 2017, our focus now shifts to execution and demonstrating the consistency of our results and our full resource potential. We have taken steps to strengthen our operating team and now have a position of scale that provides us with substantial drilling inventory. We enter 2018 in a strong position to continue generating production and EBITDA growth.”\nOPERATIONS HIGHLIGHTS\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, the Company drilled five net wells while completing four net wells. For the full year, the Company drilled 18 net wells and completed 22 net wells. The Company drilled in all areas of its portfolio in 2017 with a focus on demonstrating the commercial viability of the Company’s extensive drilling inventory. With solid results across all areas, SilverBow has successfully transferred its learnings from Fasken to other assets of the Eagle Ford, including a successful seven well program in the condensate window in Artesia as well as experiencing encouraging initial results in Oro Grande and Uno Mas.\nSilverBow completed its first well in Uno Mas in the fourth quarter. The well was drilled with a 7,500-foot lateral and completed with approximately 2,500 pounds of proppant per foot of lateral. Results to date are encouraging and the Company will have more to report on this well on their first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. The Company plans on drilling three net wells in Uno Mas in 2018. Also during the quarter, SilverBow completed its second well in Oro Grande, the NMC 2H. The Company drilled the NMC 2H with a 7,500-foot lateral and completed with 2,500 pounds of proppant per foot of lateral, compared to 3,500 pounds of proppant per foot of lateral for the NMC 1H. The Company moved a drilling rig back to Oro Grande in the first quarter of 2018 to drill a two well pad. The Company plans on drilling five net wells in Oro Grande during 2018.\nSilverBow’s most recent six well pad drilled in Fasken during the fourth quarter included three wells targeting the Lower Eagle Ford and three wells targeting the Upper Eagle Ford. This pad was recently completed and utilized 300 foot frac stage spacing and 1,500 pounds of proppant per foot of lateral. The average lateral length for this six well pad was 7,500 feet. Early results from this six well pad are encouraging and further support multi-zone development and added efficiencies for our Fasken acreage and other assets. The Company plans to drill approximately 13 net wells in Fasken in 2018.\nPRODUCTION VOLUMES, OPERATING COSTS, AND REALIZED PRICES\nSilverBow’s total net production for the fourth quarter averaged approximately 177 Mmcfe/d, which was above the high end of guidance. Production mix during the fourth quarter consisted of approximately 79% natural gas, 13% NGLs, and 8% oil.\nLease operating expenses during the fourth quarter of $0.34/Mcfe came in better than the Company’s guidance range of $0.38/Mcfe to $0.42/Mcfe primarily driven by continued cost initiatives enacted throughout the year.\nTransportation and processing expenses came in at $0.32/Mcfe while production and ad valorem taxes were 3.1% of oil and gas revenues for the quarter. Production and ad valorem taxes were positively impacted by certain, non-reoccurring tax refunds in the quarter.\nGeneral and administrative costs of $0.45/Mcfe were higher than the $0.42/Mcfe reported in the third quarter primarily due to one-time severance costs related to several officer departures.\nThe Company’s average realized natural gas price, excluding the effect of hedging, was $2.88/Mcf compared to $3.01/Mcf in the third quarter of 2017. The average realized crude oil selling price, excluding the effect of hedging, was $57.64/Bbl in the fourth quarter of 2017, up from $46.93/Bbl in the third quarter of 2017. The average realized NGL selling price in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $24.37/Bbl versus $21.67/Bbl in the third quarter of 2017.\nYEAR-END 2017 RESERVES\nSilverBow reported year-end proved reserves of 1.0 trillion cubic feet equivalent (Tcfe), an increase of 38% over year-end 2016. Specific highlights from the Company’s year-end reserve report include:\nFinding and development costs of $0.59/Mcfe All-sources reserve replacement of 609% Standardized Measure of $732 million PV-10 value (non-GAAP measure) of $805 million, an increase of 82% over prior year\nThe table below reconciles 2016 reserves to 2017 reserves.\nTotal (Mmcfe) Proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 743,741 Extensions, discoveries, and other additions 317,024 Revisions of previous estimates (8,748 ) Purchases of minerals in place 33,405 Sales of minerals in place (4,866 ) Production (56,135 ) Proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 1,024,421 As of December 31, 2017, 82% of SilverBow’s year-end proved reserves were natural gas and 97% were located in the Eagle Ford Shale. Approximately 45% of the year-end proved reserves were classified as proved developed and 55% were classified as proved undeveloped.\nTotal costs incurred during 2017 were $203 million, which included approximately $149 million for development costs, $45 million for leasehold acquisition and prospect costs, and $9 million for property acquisitions.\nThe SEC prices used for reporting SilverBow’s year-end 2017 proved reserves, which have been adjusted for basis and quality differentials, were $2.95/Mcf for natural gas, $20.32/Bbl for natural gas liquids and $50.38/Bbl for crude oil compared to $2.43/Mcf, $16.13/Bbl, and $41.07/Bbl in 2016. Assuming SEC prices, the pre-tax present value of future net cash flows discounted at 10% (“PV-10”) of the year-end 2017 proved reserves were $805 million with a Standardized Measure of $732 million.\nFINANCIAL RESULTS\nThe Company reported total oil and gas revenues of $58.7 million for the fourth quarter 2017 which increased 20% compared to third quarter 2017 levels. On a GAAP basis, the Company reported net income of $25.1 million for the fourth quarter, which includes a gain on the value of the Company's hedge portfolio of $3.4 million.\nThe Company reported Adjusted EBITDA of $42.0 million. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please see the tables included with today's news release for a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA.\nCapital expenditures incurred during the fourth quarter totaled approximately $50 million inclusive of $22 million spent on acquisitions, leasing, and prospect development. In addition, the Company spent $16.3 million associated with the divestiture of the Bay De Chene field located in South Louisiana.\nEffective December 22, 2017, the Company closed a Purchase and Sale contract for the Company's wellbores and facilities in Bay De Chene for $16.3 million, which will be paid by the Company, as seller. The buyer assumed approximately $20.9 million of plugging and abandonment liability. Please see the Company’s Form 10-K filing, which the Company expects to be filed on Thursday, March 1, 2018, for more information regarding this transaction.\nAWP OLMOS SALE UPDATE\nOn January 24 th , 2018, SilverBow Resources executed a definitive purchase and sale agreement to divest certain wells in its AWP Olmos area for approximately $28.8 million plus the assumption of $6.2 million of asset retirement obligations, subject to customary purchase price adjustments. This transaction is expected to close on or about March 1, 2018 and has an effective date of January 1, 2018. These assets are located in McMullen County, Texas and include 491 wells with total proved reserves of 28 Bcfe at 12/31/17 (100% proved developed). Full year 2017 production from these properties was approximately 9.5 Mmcfe/d (57% natural gas). Cash proceeds from the sale will be used to repay outstanding borrowings under the Company’s revolving credit facility. SilverBow anticipates that its borrowing base will remain unchanged at $330 million after closing this transaction and will be reviewed as normal during its regularly scheduled Spring redetermination.\n2018 GUIDANCE\nThe Company recently announced a 2018 capital expenditure budget of $245 to $265 million, which provides for average full year production of 175 to 195 Mmcfe/d. For the first quarter 2018, the Company is guiding for 156 to 162 Mmcfe/d. Additional detail concerning the Company's first quarter 2018 and full year financial and operational guidance can be found in the table included with today’s news release and the Corporate Presentation uploaded to the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website before the conference call.\nThe Company recently contracted a second high-spec drilling rig. SilverBow is currently mobilizing this rig with plans to commence drilling later in the first quarter with completions from this rig turning to production early in the third quarter. The Company plans on testing multiple initiatives in 2018 aimed at further delineating its acreage position as well as testing stimulation designs and choke management protocols. The Company is also assessing the viability of stacked development in certain areas of its portfolio. These multi-zone development initiatives have the potential to significantly increase the Company’s drilling inventory and allow for a more robust co-development pattern across our portfolio.\nHEDGING UPDATE\nHedging continues to be an important element of SilverBow’s strategy. The Company maintains an active hedging program to provide predictable cash flows while still allowing for flexibility in capturing increases in prices. SilverBow has approximately 55% of total production volumes hedged for full year 2018 using the mid-point of production guidance. The Company continues to layer on additional hedges. Please see the Company’s Form 10-K filing, which the Company expects to be filed on Thursday, March 1, 2018, for a detailed summary of derivative contracts.\nCAPITAL STRUCTURE AND LIQUIDITY\nThe Company had liquidity of approximately $260 million as of December 31, 2017, primarily consisting of availability on the Company’s $330 million bank credit facility. The Company closed on $200 million of Senior Secured Second Lien Notes on December 15, 2017. For more information regarding the Second Lien Notes, please see the Company’s Corporate Presentation posted on www.sbow.com .\nAs of February 28, 2018, the Company had 11.6 million total common shares outstanding.\nCONFERENCE CALL & UPDATED INVESTOR PRESENTATION\nSilverBow will host a conference call for investors on Thursday, March 1, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Central Time (11:00 a.m. Eastern Time).

Our Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because all companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner.\nSuccessor Predecessor Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nPeriod from April 23,\n2016 through\nDecember 31, 2016\nPeriod from January\n1, 2016 through April\n22, 2016\nNet Income (Loss) $ 71,971 $ (156,288 ) $ 851,611 Plus: Depreciation, depletion and amortization 46,933 36,436 20,439 Accretion of asset retirement obligations 2,322 2,878 1,610 Interest expense 15,070 15,310 13,347 Impairment of oil and gas properties — 133,496 77,732 Reorganization items — 1,639 (956,142 ) Derivative (gain)/loss (17,913 ) 19,677 — Derivative cash settlements collected/(paid) (1) (1,545 ) (2,130 ) — Income tax expense/(benefit) (1,954 ) — — Share-based compensation expense 6,849 3,618 886 Adjusted EBITDA $ 121,733 $ 54,636 $ 9,483 (1) This includes accruals for settled contracts covering commodity deliveries during the period where the actual cash settlements occur outside of the period.\nSuccessor Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nNet Income (Loss) $ 25,137 $ (7,081 ) Plus: Depreciation, depletion and amortization 14,558 9,815 Accretion of asset retirement obligations 600 947 Interest expense 3,953 5,173 Impairment of oil and gas properties — — Reorganization items — (170 ) Derivative (gain)/loss (3,448 ) 12,553 Derivative cash settlements collected/(paid) (1) 807 (1,173 ) Income tax expense/(benefit) (1,954 ) — Share-based compensation expense 2,311 486 Adjusted EBITDA $ 41,964 $ 20,550 (1) This includes accruals for settled contracts covering commodity deliveries during the period where the actual cash settlements occur outside of the period.

We present F&D costs in addition to and used in conjunction with our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Due to various factors, including but not limited to timing differences, F&D costs do not necessarily reflect precisely the costs associated with particular reserves. Further, our F&D costs may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because all companies may not calculate F&D costs in the same manner.\nF&D All-In costs are calculated by dividing the total acquisition, exploration, and development costs for the year by extensions, discoveries, and other additions, purchases of minerals in place, and total revisions for the year.\nReserve replacement ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of extensions, discoveries, and other additions, purchases of minerals in place, and total revisions for the year by production.\nF&D Cost reconciliation Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nin $000's Lease acquisitions and prospect costs $ 44,569 Exploration — Development 149,293 Acquisition of property $ 9,426 Total acquisition, exploration, and development $ 203,288 in Mmcfe Proved reserves as of December 31, 2016 743,741 Extensions, discoveries, and other additions (1) 317,024 Revisions of previous estimates (8,748 ) Purchases of minerals in place 33,405 Sales of minerals in place (4,866 ) Production (56,135 ) Proved reserves as of December 31, 2017 1,024,421 F&D Costs ($/Mcfe) 0.59 Reserve replacement ratio 609 % (1) The increase in 2017 was primarily attributable to extensions added based on drilling results and leasing of adjacent acreage.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180228006590/en/\nSilverBow Resources, Inc.\nDoug Atkinson, CFA, (281) 874-2700, (800) 777-2412\nSenior Manager - Finance & Investor Relations\nSource: SilverBow Resources, Inc.",
