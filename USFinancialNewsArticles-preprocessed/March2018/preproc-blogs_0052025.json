They said it would be included in an ongoing investigation into Shell and Italyâ€™s Eni (ENI.MI) over the acquisition of a different Nigerian oilfield, known as OPL 245. \nShell and Eni deny any wrongdoing related to OPL 245, in which Robinson is being prosecuted. A spokesman for Anglo-Dutch Shell said the two cases were unrelated. \nThe full   www.reuters.com",
