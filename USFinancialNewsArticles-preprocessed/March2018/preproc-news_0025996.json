Additionally, the firm has hired Benjamin Thomason as executive vice president of sales and John Skovron as chief technical officer (CTO). These strategic appointments support Vestwell's dedication to enhancing their technology, supporting clients, and making retirement plans simpler and more accessible.\nJohn Moody, founder and former president of Matrix, will leverage his knowledge as an operator and his position as an industry guru to enhance Vestwell's value proposition by serving on the Board of Directors. John's firsthand experience in building scale around a growing business makes him well suited to help Vestwell increase market share.\nDrew Lawton, former CEO of New York Life and Pyramis – Fidelity's retirement vertical, has recently joined Vestwell's Advisory Board. As a former operator on the institutional side, Drew's extensive wealth of knowledge in the financial services space will help steer the company to new strategic heights.\n\"Both John and Drew bring imposing knowledge from their careers in financial services and their insight will advance Vestwell's mission to help advisors more seamlessly offer retirement plan services to their clients,\" said Vestwell CEO Aaron Schumm . \"I welcome them to Vestwell and look forward to hearing their valuable perspectives as Vestwell continues to poise for new growth.\"\nTo support ongoing growth including the expansion of offerings and services, Vestwell has brought on two senior hires in Benjamin Thomason and John Skovron.\nBenjamin Thomason joins Vestwell as executive vice president of sales from Goldman Sachs where he was responsible for developing institutional partnerships for Honest Dollar. With over 15 years of financial services industry experience, Benjamin will lead Vestwell's sales and service operations with a focus on expanding the firm's advisor relationships, building new strategic institutional relationships, and maintaining world-class customer service.\nJohn Skovron previously served as senior vice president platform engineering at Integral Ad Science focusing on high throughput data collection, big data processing, software testing and release engineering, and technical and network operations.
