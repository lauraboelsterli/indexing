    "text": "NEW YORK, March 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- WE Family Offices , the independent, family-focused wealth management firm proudly announces today that Chief Executive Maria Elena (Mel) Lagomasino received the Lifetime Achievement Award from Family Wealth Report as part of the 2018 Family Wealth Report Awards . This award recognizes individuals who have dedicated their careers in wealth management to putting the needs of the families they serve first.\nMaria Elena Lagomasino wins Lifetime Achievement Award from Family Wealth Report\nSince the beginning of her career , Mel has been a trailblazer in the private wealth industry, constantly working to understand and meet the needs of wealthy families from all over the world. When the private bank business model evolved to be focused on sales more than advice, she left to lead a large, national multi-family office. In 2013 she, along with co-founders Michael Zeuner and Santiago Ulloa, founded WE Family Offices. Since founding WE Family Offices, the firm has grown to serve nearly 70 families and oversee or report on more than $8 billion in assets.\n“Serving and advising families is not only my vocation, it’s my passion” comments Mel. “I feel fortunate to have worked with and learned from so many wonderful families over the course of my career and to have had the pleasure of partnering with so many talented professionals in our industry. I am truly delighted and grateful that the Family Wealth Report has honored me with this award.”\nManaging Partner Santiago Ulloa comments, “I have enjoyed working with Mel these past 10 years. She really understands that advice is different from selling products. The families with whom we work can see that, and that’s the reason for her success.”\nWE Family Offices serves families in one of three ways:\nAs an outsourced family office for an ultra-high net worth family As an extension of an existing single-family office Conducting special projects for single-family offices\nManaging Partner Michael Zeuner comments, “For 20 years, I’ve been honored to work with Mel. She is truly dedicated to the families she serves and is an inspiring leader and executive. Mel has blazed the trail for a new family-focused wealth management business model, and in doing so, has sparked the evolution of the wealth management industry. I am pleased that Family Wealth Report has chosen to honor her with this award.”\nAbout WE Family Offices\nWith offices in New York and Miami, WE Family Offices is an award-winning independent, family- focused wealth management firm, serving ultra-high net worth clients.
