Putin said that Russia had tested an array of new nuclear weapons, including a new nuclear-powered missile at the end of 2017 which could reach almost any point in the world and could not be intercepted by anti-missile systems. “We would consider any use of nuclear weapons against Russia or its allies to be a nuclear attack on our country. The response would be immediate,” Putin said in a speech to Russian lawmakers. Reporting by Andrey Ostroukh and Polina Ivanova; Writing by Maria Tsvetkova; Editing by Andrew Osborn",
