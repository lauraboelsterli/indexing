    "text": "For the first time, customers can turn to one source for complete clear plastic sheet product portfolio\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Plaskolite, LLC , North America’s largest manufacturer of acrylic sheet products, announced today that it is acquiring the North American polycarbonate sheet manufacturing business of Covestro, a global leader in high-tech polymer materials. The acquisition transforms the North American sheet industry by combining the leader in acrylic manufacturing and the leader in polycarbonate manufacturing.\nAs a part of the transaction, Plaskolite is acquiring sheet headquarters, production sites and warehouse facilities in Sheffield, Massachusetts and will maintain the existing third-party distribution warehouse facility in Hebron, Ohio. With this acquisition, Plaskolite will employ 950 people.\nThe closing is expected to be completed August 1, 2018.\nFounded in 1950 in Columbus, Ohio, by Donald G. Dunn and family, Plaskolite, LLC is the largest North American manufacturer of see-through thermoplastic sheet products. Plaskolite’s customized products are used in a wide variety of applications, including windows, doors, lighting, signs, point-of-purchase displays and bath products. Plaskolite serves a diverse customer base, including distributors, OEMs and retailers.\n“This acquisition is transformational for Plaskolite and strengthens our industry leadership position,” said Mitchell Grindley, Plaskolite’s President and CEO. “It broadens our offering and further strengthens our partnerships. Plaskolite will be the only manufacturer ever to offer a complete clear sheet product portfolio, including Acrylic, Polycarbonate, PETG and ABS, which is a benefit to customers who can now turn to one source for all their sheet needs.”\nThis will be the second business that Plaskolite has acquired from Covestro. In 2012, Plaskolite purchased its North American Vivak ® line of PETG sheet. Covestro corporate headquarters are in Leverkusen, Germany.\nThis announcement follows Plaskolite’s February 12 announcement of its acquisition of the Continuous Cast Acrylic Sheet Business of Lucite International Inc., which broadened its acrylic sheet offering and provided an entrée into the spa and bath sheet business.\nAbout Plaskolite, LLC\nFounded in 1950 in Columbus, Ohio, by Donald G. Dunn and family, Plaskolite, LLC is the largest privately owned North American manufacturer of see-through thermoplastic sheet products. Plaskolite’s customized products are used in a wide variety of applications, including windows, doors, lighting, signs, point-of-purchase displays and bath products.
