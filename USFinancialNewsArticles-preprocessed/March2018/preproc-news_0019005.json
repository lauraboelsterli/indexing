(NASDAQ:JYNT), a national operator, manager and franchisor of chiropractic clinics, reported results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.\nFourth Quarter Financial Highlights: 2017 Compared to 2016\nPosted eighth consecutive quarter of financial improvement. Increased gross system-wide sales 32%, to $36.1 million. Grew system-wide comp sales 1 26%. Increased revenue 20% to $6.9 million. Improved net loss $5.5 million to $(213,000). Reported positive Adjusted EBITDA of $0.4 million, an improvement of $1.8 million from fourth quarter of 2016. Company owned or managed clinics were Adjusted EBITDA positive for the second consecutive quarter. Added net 10 franchised clinics, increasing total clinics to 399 at December 31, 2017, and announced the 400 th clinic opening in January 2018. Signed 2 new regional development agreements, increasing total to 18 at December 31, 2017.\nPeter D. Holt, president and chief executive officer of The Joint Corp, said, “2017 ended with our eighth consecutive quarter of financial improvement. These achievements reflect our steady, disciplined approach, the validation of our business strategy and our strengthened foundation for growth. For 2017, gross system-wide sales reached $126.9 million, up 29% compared to 2016. We also delivered 21% annual same store sales growth; increased operating efficiencies to reduce new clinic time to breakeven; generated cash from operations; and rebuilt our regional developer (RD) network.\n“In 2018, we expect to accelerate growth by increasing franchise sales, both direct and those generated through our regional developers, whose territories now cover roughly one third of the US, and by strategically increasing company owned or managed clinics through acquisition and/or building greenfields. We are pleased to have moved beyond stabilizing the business in 2017, and are well positioned for a strong 2018 and future growth.”\nFourth Quarter Financial Results: 2017 Compared to 2016\nRevenue grew 20% to $6.9 million, compared to $5.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, due primarily to increased sales in company owned or managed clinics and a greater number of franchised clinics.\nCost of revenue was $1.0 million, up 30% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, due to higher regional developer royalties from an increased number of open franchised clinics and increased clinic revenues in regional developer territories.\nSelling and marketing expenses were $1.3 million, increased slightly from $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, reflecting slightly higher marketing expenses related to our national marketing program. General and administrative expenses were $4.4 million, decreased 50% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. The prior year expense of $8.9 million included a $3.5 million loss on disposition or impairment related to the closure of company managed clinics in Chicago and New York, non-operating lease costs for halting of greenfield clinic development, and greater payroll and occupancy costs related to 14 more corporate clinics operating in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet loss was $(213,000), or $(0.02) per share, compared to $(5.8) million, or $(0.45) per share, in the same period last year.\nAdjusted EBITDA income was $419,000, an improvement of $1.8 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA loss of $(1.4) million in the same quarter last year. The company defines Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, as EBITDA before acquisition-related expenses, bargain purchase gain, loss on disposition or impairment, and stock-based compensation expenses. The company defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before net interest, tax expense, depreciation, and amortization expenses.\nBalance Sheet Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, cash and cash equivalents were $4.2 million, compared to $3.0 million at December 31, 2016. Pursuant to the terms of the company’s credit agreement, during the first quarter of 2017, the company borrowed a required $1.0 million on its line of credit, which remains unused as part of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. For the year, the company increased cash, excluding debt, by $200,000.\nFull Year Financial Results: 2017 Compared to 2016\nRevenues were $25.2 million, growing 23%. Gross profit was $21.9 million, increasing 24%. General and administrative expenses were $18.5 million, improving 28%. General and administrative expense as a percent of revenue decreased from 125% in 2016 to 74% in 2017. General and administrative operating leverage is expected to continue to improve with the increase in gross sales across all clinics.\nNet loss improved 78% from $(15.2) million in 2016 to $(3.3) million in 2017, or to $(0.25) per share for the full year compared to $(1.20) per share in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $(91,000), compared to $(7.7) million last year – representing a 99% improvement.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nManagement has provided full year 2018 financial guidance and franchise opening expectations as set forth below:\nRevenue is expected to be between $31 million and $32 million, up from $25.2 million in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $2.5 million and $3.5 million, improving from a loss of $(91,000) in 2017. Total new clinic openings are expected to be in the range of 40 to 52 including 40 to 50 new franchised clinics, up to two corporate-owned or managed greenfield clinics and up to three buyback clinics, which when acquired from franchisees are neutral to the total clinic count.\nConference Call\nThe Joint Corp. management will host a conference call at 5:00 p.m. ET on Thursday, March 8, 2018, to discuss the fourth quarter and full year 2017 results.

These are presented because they are important measures used by management to assess financial performance, as management believes they provide a more transparent view of the Company’s underlying operating performance and operating trends. Reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is presented in the table below. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before acquisition-related expenses, bargain purchase gain, loss on disposition or impairment, and stock-based compensation expenses. The Company defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before net interest, tax expense, depreciation, and amortization expenses.\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered alternatives to net income or cash flows from operations, as determined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used as measures of financial performance and the ability to meet debt service requirements, they are not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should be reviewed in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains statements about future events and expectations that constitute forward-looking statements.
