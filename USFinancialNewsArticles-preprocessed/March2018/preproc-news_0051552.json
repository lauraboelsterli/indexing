Forward-looking statements normally contain words like 'believe', 'expect', 'anticipate', 'plan', 'intend', 'continue', 'estimate', 'may', 'will', 'should', 'ongoing' and similar expressions, and within this news release include, without limitation, statements (express or implied) respecting: the expected delisting date of the Avigilon shares and the application of Avigilon to cease to be a reporting issuer.\nForward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, actions or developments and are based on expectations, assumptions and other factors that Avigilon's management currently believes are relevant, reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances.\nAlthough Avigilon's management believes that the forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could be substantially different due to the risks and uncertainties associated with and inherent to Avigilon's business, as more particularly described in the \"Risk Factors\" sections of Avigilon's Management Information Circular dated February 21, 2018 and Avigilon's Annual Information Form dated March 6, 2018, each of which is available under Avigilon's profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . Although Avigilon has attempted to identify factors that may cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those disclosed in the forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, predicted, estimated or intended. Also, many of the factors are beyond the control of Avigilon. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nAvigilon undertakes no obligation to reissue or update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or events after the date hereof except as may be required by law. All forward-looking statements contained in this news release are qualified by this cautionary statement.\nSOURCE Avigilon Corporation",
