    "text": "Target told employees at the start of 2017 that if same-store sales increased for the year, they could start wearing jeans on the weekends. \n\"Expect to see a lot more denim,\" CEO Brian Cornell told analysts and investors Tuesday during the retailer's annual meeting with the financial community. \nSame-store sales for the full fiscal year were up 1.3 percent, Target reported earlier in the day , compared with a decline of 0.5 percent the previous year. Fiscal fourth-quarter same-store sales grew 3.6 percent from a year earlier, boosted by a spike in traffic around the holidays, surpassing analysts' expectations. \nTarget shares were falling more than 4 percent by Tuesday afternoon, as investors worried the retailer's investments in e-commerce and employees were weighing too heavily on profit margins. \nThe company has outlined other spending plans for the year, including an expansion of same-day delivery and free two-day shipping on purchases made via Target.com. All the announcements Tuesday tie back to Target's $7 billion investment strategy, which runs through 2020.",
