In Asia, some indexes rose after news surfaced that the U.S. had agreed to excuse South Korea from steel levies. Meantime in Europe, stocks were slightly higher as investors tried to shake off worries surrounding a potential trade war. \nWall Street finished Friday’s session deep in the red on Friday, with the Dow dropping more than 400 points by the close — closing at its lowest level since November and finishing in correction territory, as it was 11.6 percent down from its 52-week high. \nLast week, President Donald Trump signed an executive memorandum that would inflict tariffs on Chinese imports — of up to $60 billion. China retaliated with their own set of levies, drawing up a list of 128 U.S. products that could be possible retaliation targets. \nSocial media firms continue to be under the radar, as abuse of people’s data remains a key topic of discussion. Last week, reports emerged alleging that Cambridge Analytica, an analytics company, had gathered data from 50 million Facebook profiles without the permission of its users. While Facebook have since come out to apologize and try to rectify the matter, concerns remain. \nOn the central banking front, members of the U.S. Federal Reserve are due to deliver speeches at respective events Monday, including one by Fed Vice Chair Randal Quarles, who is due to speak at the HOPE Global Forum annual meeting in Atlanta.
