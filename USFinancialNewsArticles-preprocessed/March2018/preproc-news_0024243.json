    "text": "MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) ordered Bata India Ltd on Monday to carry out an internal probe into the suspected leak of unpublished financial data and asked the footwear maker to strengthen its handling of such data.\nFile Photo: The logo of Bata shoes brand is pictured on a store in Paris, France, February 15, 2016. REUTERS/Charles Platiau The direction from SEBI widens an ongoing investigation after a Reuters report late last year showed prescient messages about financial results of companies were shared in private WhatsApp chatrooms before their official release.\nReuters identified 12 such instances relating to as many companies, with HDFC Bank and Axis Bank among the firms identified. Both of those banks have been issued orders similar to the one handed to Bata.\nBata's financial information circulated in WhatsApp groups \"matched with the quarterly financial results of the company for December 31, 2015,\" the regulator said on Monday. ( bit.ly/2FC8LKg )\nThis could not have been possible without the “leakage of information” from a person, or people, privy to the information, SEBI said, adding it pointed to the inadequacy of the processes and systems that Bata India has in place.\nSEBI ordered Bata India to investigate the issue and take action against those responsible within three months and submit a report to the regulator.\nBata India could not be reached immediately outside regular business hours.\nSEBI sent a similar order last week to Tata Motors, which owns luxury brand Jaguar Land Rover.\nThe Reuters report has sparked a broad investigation by the regulator since December, including raids on brokers’ homes that resulted in the confiscation of laptops and mobile phones.\nReporting by Abhirup Roy; Editing by Euan Rocha and Adrian Croft\n ",
