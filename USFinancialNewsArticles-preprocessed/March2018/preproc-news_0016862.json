He will officially assume his ILPA role on March 26, 2018, based out of the organization’s Washington, DC office.\n“Steve Nelson brings an authentic and collaborative leadership style to our Board of Directors and team,” said Tanya Carmichael, Managing Director, Global Funds, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan and Chair of the ILPA Board of Directors. “His strong strategic planning, business building background and vision for the organization will be an incredible asset to our membership, which continues to grow substantially.
