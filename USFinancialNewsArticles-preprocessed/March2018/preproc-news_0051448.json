US$148 million (€123 million) at end of 2017\nJENA, Germany, March 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- InflaRx (Nasdaq:IFRX), a biopharmaceutical company developing innovative therapeutics to treat life-threatening inflammatory diseases by targeting the complement system, a key component of the innate immune system, announced today financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n“2017 has been a transformational year for InflaRx, highlighted by multiple achievements in our pipeline and completion of two important financings that will fuel future development of our key therapeutic candidates,” said Prof. Niels C. Riedemann, Chief Executive Officer. “Specifically, we demonstrated efficacy with our lead product, IFX-1, in a phase IIa clinical trial to treat Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS), and completed a US$55 million private financing in October, followed by a successful US$106 million Nasdaq IPO in November. These financings provide the resources we need to drive our pipeline forward.”\nIn January 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the IND application for IFX-1, a complement C5a inhibitor, in HS. Subsequently, InflaRx initiated phase IIb clinical testing in HS patients, and top-line data from this trial are anticipated during the first half of 2019. In 2018, the Company plans to initiate additional phase IIb clinical development of IFX-1 in antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) and in another autoimmune or inflammatory indication.\n2017 Corporate highlights\nIn September 2017, the company announced positive topline data from an exploratory Phase IIa clinical trial with lead compound IFX-1, a first-in-class anti-human complement factor C5a monoclonal antibody, in patients suffering from moderate to severe Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS), a painful, chronic and debilitating inflammatory skin disease. Assessment of the efficacy, measured by the validated and clinically relevant Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) score, demonstrated a response rate of 75% (nine out of twelve patients) at the end of the treatment period and 83% (ten out of twelve) at the end of the twelve-week follow up period. In October 2017, InflaRx successfully closed a Series D financing and investment round of US$55 million. The round was co-led by Bain Capital Life Sciences LP, Cormorant Asset Management LLC, RA Capital Management LLC, and complemented by Black Rock. In November 2017, InflaRx raised US$106 million in its Nasdaq IPO (incl. green shoe). J.P. Morgan, Leerink Partners and BMO Capital Markets acted as lead managers. On February 6, 2018, InflaRx appointed Tony Gibney to its Board of Directors. Mr. Gibney was a life sciences-focused investment banker for 23 years at Leerink Partners, Merrill Lynch, and Lehman Brothers.\n2017 Financial highlights\nCash and cash equivalents totaled €123.3 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to €29.1 million as of December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to the completion of InflaRx’ initial public offering of its common shares in November 2017 and the exercised green shoe in December 2017, as well as the primary portion of the Series D financing executed in October 2017.\nNet cash used in operating activities increased from €5.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 to €12.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, mainly due to the increase of cash expenses for research and development, such as third-party expenses for manufacturing and clinical trials attributable to InflaRx’ lead program IFX-1 and personnel expenses.\nResearch and development expenses increased by €9.1 million to €14.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 from € 5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase is primarily attributable to a €5.1 million increase in CRO and CMO expenses for IFX-1 in connection with the preparation of the Phase IIb clinical trial in patients with HS and the Phase II clinical trial in patients with AAV and to a €3.4 million increase in employee-related costs associated with salaries, bonus, benefits and non-cash share-based compensation.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by €3.3 million to €5.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from €1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase is primarily attributable to a €1.8 million increase in employee-related costs associated with salaries, bonus, benefits and non-cash share-based compensation. Legal, consulting and audit fees and other expenses increased by €1.0 million, which is mainly attributable to expenses incurred in connection with the IPO and Nasdaq listing.\nFinance costs (net) increased by €2.8 million to €4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from €2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase is mainly attributable to interest expense on outstanding preferred shares issued in the Series C financing, which increased by €0.4 million to €2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from €1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016; and unrealized foreign exchanges losses which increased by €2.4 million to €2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet loss for the year 2017 was €24.2 million or €2.6 per common share, compared to €8.9 million or €3.8 per common share for the year 2016.\nAdditional information regarding these results is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017 and “Item 5. Operating and Financial Review and Prospects,” which will be included in InflaRx’s Annual Report on Form 20-F as filed with the SEC.\nInflaRx N.V. and subsidiary Consolidated statements of comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, in € thousand 2016 2017 Other income and expenses (net) 231 108 Research and development expenses (5,278 ) (14,415 ) General and administrative expenses (1,844 ) (5,138 ) Loss before interest and income taxes (6,891 ) (19,445 ) Finance income 1 130 Finance costs (2,049 ) (4,923 ) Finance costs (net) (2,048 ) (4,793 ) Loss before income taxes (8,939 ) (24,238 ) Income taxes 0 0 Loss for the period (8,939 ) (24,238 ) Other comprehensive income Items that may be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss: Exchange differences on translating foreign operations 1 0 Other comprehensive income for the period 1 0 Total comprehensive loss (8,938 ) (24,238 ) Loss per common share in € (basic/diluted) (3.8 ) (2.6 )\nInflaRx N.V. and subsidiary Consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31, in € thousand 2016 2017 ASSETS Non-current assets Intangible assets 5 41 Laboratory and office equipment 131 173 Financial assets 1 20 Total non-current assets 137 234 Current assets Other assets 264 696 Cash and cash equivalents 29,117 123,282 Total current assets 29,381 123,979 Total assets 29,518 124,213 EQUITY AND LIABILITIES Equity Issued capital 31 2,858 Other reserves 1,685 167,864 Accumulated deficit (27,055 ) (51,293 ) Own shares (350 ) 0 Total equity (25,689 ) 119,429 Non-current liabilities Preferred shares 53,440 0 Deferred income 19 15 Provisions 2 2 Total non-current liabilities 53,461 17 Current liabilities Trade payables 1,534 4,464 Other liabilities, provisions 212 302 Total current liabilities 1,746 4,767 Total equity and liabilities 29,518 124,213\nInflaRx N.V. and subsidiary Consolidated statements of changes in equity for the years ended December 31, Other reserves in € thousand Issued\ncapital Capital\nreserve currency\ntranslation share-based\npayments Accumulated\ndeficit Own\nshares Total\nequity Balance as of January 1, 2016 31 -\n9 807 (18,116 ) (350 ) (17,619 ) Comprehensive loss Loss for the period -\n-\n-\n-\n(8,939 ) -\n(8,939 ) Total comprehensive loss -\n- -\n-\n(8,939 ) -\n(8,939 ) Recognition of equity-settled share-based payments - - - 868 - - 868 Balance as of December 31, 2016 /January 1, 2017 31 -\n9 1,675 (27,055 ) (350 ) (25,690 ) Comprehensive loss Loss for the period -\n-\n-\n-\n(24,238 ) -\n(24,238 ) Total comprehensive loss - -\n-\n-\n(24,238 ) -\n(24,238 ) Recognition of equity-settled share-based payments - - - 4,550 - - 4,550 Issue of share capital Issued shares 848 90,055 - - - - 90,904 Transaction costs - (9,115 ) - - - - (9,115 ) Total issue of share capital 848 80,941 -\n-\n-\n-\n81,789 Liquidation of a subsidiary - - (9 ) - - - (9 ) Reorganization 1,979 80,698 - - - 350 83,026 Balance as of December 31, 2017 2,858 161,639 -\n6,226 (51,293 ) -\n119,429\nInflaRx N.V. and subsidiary Consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, in € thousand 2016 2017 Cash flow from Operations Loss before income taxes (8,939 ) (24,238 ) Reconciliation from result before taxes to net cash flows Depreciation/amortization of intangible assets, laboratory and\noffice equipment 33 71 Share based payment expense 868 4,550 Finance Income (1 ) (130 ) Finance costs 2,049 4,923 other non-cash adjustments (2 ) 24 Change in Provisions and Government Grants (136 ) (71 ) Working capital adjustments Change in Trade payables and other liabilities 1,442 3,086 Change in other assets (96 ) (433 ) Interest received (0 ) 66 Interest paid (212 ) 0 Cash flow from Operations (4,992 ) (12,152 ) Cash flow from investing activities Cash outflow from the purchase of intangible assets, laboratory\nand office equipment (53 ) (149 ) Cash outflow for the investment in non-current financial assets 0 (19 ) Net cash flows used in investing activities (53 ) (167 ) Financing activities Proceeds from issuance of stock 0 90,904 Transaction cost from issuance of stock 0 (9,115 ) Proceeds from issuance of preferred shares 30,993 27,069 Share issue costs paid (133 ) (56 ) Net cash flows from/(used in) financing activities 30,860 108,801 Effect of exchange rate changes 1 (2,317 ) Change in cash and cash equivalents 25,815 94,165 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 25,815 94,165 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 3,302 29,117 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 29,117 123,282 IFX-1 is a first-in-class monoclonal anti-complement factor C5a antibody, which highly and effectively blocks the biological activity of C5a and demonstrates high selectivity towards its target in human blood. Thus, IFX-1 leaves the formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9) intact as an important defense mechanism, which is not the case for molecules blocking the cleavage of C5. IFX-1 has demonstrated control of the inflammatory response driven tissue and organ damage by specifically blocking C5a as a key “amplifier” of this response in pre-clinical studies. IFX-1 is the first monoclonal anti-C5a antibody introduced into clinical development that has, to date, successfully completed three clinical Phase II studies. In total, more than 150 patients have so far been treated with IFX-1, which was well tolerated. IFX-1 is currently being developed for different inflammatory indications.\nInflaRx N.V. (Nasdaq:IFRX) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on applying its proprietary anti-C5a technology to discover and develop first-in-class, potent and specific inhibitors of C5a. Complement C5a is a powerful inflammatory mediator involved in the progression of a wide variety of autoimmune and other inflammatory diseases. InflaRx was founded in 2007 and has offices in Jena and in Munich, Germany. For further information please visit www.inflarx.com .\nContacts:\nInflaRx N.V.\nProf. Dr. Niels C.
