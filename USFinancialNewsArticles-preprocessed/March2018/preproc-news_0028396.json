Retrofitting cars, as opposed to building new ones, could help the company produce autonomous vehicles more quickly and inexpensively, he said. \nThe announcement Wednesday adds to Lyft’s extensive roster of self-driving-vehicle partners, which includes Ford Motor Co. F, +2.23% ; General Motors Co. GM, -0.84% ; Alphabet’s Waymo; nuTonomy Inc.; Tata Motors Ltd.’s TTM, -0.40% Jaguar Land Rover; and Aptiv PLC DLPH, -2.43% , formerly Delphi. That stands in contrast to rival Uber Technologies Inc., which is primarily developing self-driving technology on its own rather than forging partnerships.",
