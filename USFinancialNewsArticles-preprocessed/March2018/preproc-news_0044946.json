    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS, March 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- General Mills, Inc. (NYSE: GIS) (\"General Mills\") announced today that it has launched an underwritten public offering (the \"Equity Offering\") of approximately $1,000,000,000 of shares of its common stock, par value $0.10 per share (\"Common Stock\"). General Mills intends to grant the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to approximately $100 million of additional shares of its Common Stock.\nGeneral Mills intends to use the net proceeds from the Equity Offering, together with the net proceeds from a contemplated senior unsecured notes offering (the \"Notes Offering\"), the incurrence of debt under General Mills' U.S. commercial paper program and cash on hand to finance its previously announced acquisition (the \"Acquisition\") of Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Inc. (\"Blue Buffalo\") and to pay related fees and expenses.\nThe Equity Offering is not contingent upon the consummation of the Acquisition or the contemplated Notes Offering. If for any reason the Acquisition does not close, then General Mills expects to use the net proceeds from the Equity Offering for general corporate purposes.\nGoldman Sachs & Co. LLC and BofA Merrill Lynch are acting as joint book-running managers and representatives of the underwriters for the Equity Offering. Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co.

Neither General Mills, nor Blue Buffalo undertakes any obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/general-mills-announces-proposed-public-offering-of-common-stock-in-connection-with-pending-acquisition-of-blue-buffalo-pet-products-300619705.html\nSOURCE General Mills",
