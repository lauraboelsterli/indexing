Gore & Associates today announced that Jason Field, global sales and marketing leader for Gore Medical Products Division, will succeed Terri Kelly in the role of President and CEO effective April 1, 2018. Terri Kelly will continue to serve on Gore’s Board of Directors through July 2018.\n“After nearly 35 years as an Associate, I’ve decided to retire from Gore and pursue some outside interests. I’m looking forward to applying my learnings and experiences to help other organizations,” said president and CEO Terri Kelly. “Jason’s strong leadership skills, track record of success in product, business and functional roles, and his ability to engage all stakeholders to create exceptional outcomes position him well for leading Gore.”\nJason Field joined Gore in 2005 as a product specialist focusing on medical devices that treat thoracic aortic aneurysms. He continuously broadened his commitments, serving as a co-leader of Gore’s highly successful aortic business before moving into sales and marketing leadership roles. Jason is also a member of the Medical Products Division leadership team and a key contributor to global Enterprise initiatives.\n“I am excited to work alongside my fellow Associates to shape the future of our Enterprise,” said Jason Field, global sales and marketing leader for Gore’s Medical Products Division. “We have strong organizational momentum, and I look forward to creating value for all our stakeholders by applying my passion for exceptional customer experiences, innovation and Associate engagement to improve life for our customers, communities and Associates.”\n“During her 13-year tenure as President and CEO, Terri has maintained an unwavering commitment to our cultural values and has led Gore’s growth into the strong, innovative, global Enterprise we are today. Terri has exemplified leadership at Gore, and we are grateful for her many contributions to the success of our Enterprise,” said chair of the board, Bret Snyder. “Jason is the ideal candidate to continue to grow and develop our Enterprise consistent with the vision of Bill and Vieve Gore when they founded the company 60 years ago.”\nAbout Gore\nW.
