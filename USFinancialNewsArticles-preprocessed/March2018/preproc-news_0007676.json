    "text": "Girls Trip star Tiffany Haddish has already proven she likes a good deal—her Groupon loyalty even earned her a gig as the discount e-commerce site’s spokesperson .\nBut now the star has taken that same approach to her apparel. The dress Haddish donned for the Oscars on Sunday has made more than one appearance—and Haddish is here to talk about it.\nTiffany Haddish during the Opening Monologue of SNL on November 11, 2017. NBC NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images The actor originally wore the dress to the premiere of Girls Trip . But, she later explained, the dress was so expensive she didn’t want to wear it just once. So Haddish wore it again when she hosted Saturday Night Live —and even acknowledged that she had worn it before in her monologue .\nShe said she'd do it and she did! @TiffanyHaddish got the most possible use out of this beautiful white dress. Seen here tonight at the #Oscars , when she hosted 'Saturday Night Live' and at the 'Girls Trip' premiere. https://t.co/cB70ngoVAi pic.twitter.com/SbSxyuBJlE\n— Deadline Hollywood (@DEADLINE) March 5, 2018\n“I feel like I should be able to wear what I want, when I want, however many times I want, as long as I Febreze it,” Haddish said in her monologue.\nEven though her team told her it was “taboo to wear it twice,” Haddish said, “I don’t give a dang about no taboo. I spent a lot of money on this dress. This dress cost way more than my mortgage. This is an Alexander McQueen, okay?”\n“It’s a $4,000 dress. I’m going to wear this dress multiple times,” Haddish said. And re-wear it she has.\nGirls Trip may have brought in over $140 million, and the Internet estimates Haddish’s net worth at $2 million. But Haddish claimed on SNL she “ain’t seen this money. Where is this $2 million? What do I gotta do to get this $2 million?”\nActress Tiffany Haddish attends the premiere of \"Girls Trip\" at Regal LA Live Stadium 14 on July 13, 2017 in Los Angeles, California. Jason LaVeris—FilmMagic In the meantime, she’ll keep re-wearing the $4,000 Alexander McQueen dress. Men rewear tuxes to these events, so why can’t women do the same with the dress they love and spent beaucoup on?",
