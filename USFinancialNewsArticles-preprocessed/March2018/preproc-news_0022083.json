    "text": "Mark Hamill, who played the ionic Luke Skywalker in the original Star Wars trilogy as well as the recent film The Last Jedi , received his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Thursday.\nCo-star Harrison Ford , who played Han Solo in the films, was on hand for the unveiling, joking in his speech for Hamill, ‚ÄúMore people showed up when I got my star.‚Äù Star Wars creator George Lucas was also present for the event and expressed how proud he was of Hamill for getting the honor alongside many of Hollywood‚Äôs greats. R2-D2 and several stormtroopers also stood by during the presentation but declined to make any remarks.\nIn recognition of Hamill being awarded a star, Star Wars‚Äô Twitter account dubbed the day #JediDay .\nHappy #JediDay ! Celebrate with us as @HamillHimself gets his star on the Walk of Fame. pic.twitter.com/wOHEPzR7Lg\n‚Äî Star Wars (@starwars) March 8, 2018\nAfter his star was unveiled, Hamill had just one thing to say: ‚ÄúThey spelled it right!‚Äù\nüëèüëèüëè @HamillHimself #JediDay pic.twitter.com/gWnT5zUjg1\n‚Äî Star Wars (@starwars) March 8, 2018\nOne notable absence from Hamill‚Äôs star ceremony was costar Carrie Fisher, who died last year. Ford noted the absence of ‚Äúthe other member of our trio‚Äù in his speech, followed by saying, ‚ÄúI feel her presence.‚Äù Carrie‚Äôs daughter, Billie Lourde, attended the event in the place of her mother.\nBoth Hamill and Fisher starred in the latest Star Wars film.\nHamill recently made headlines based on a fight with Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai over net neutrality. On Twitter, Hamill said the FCC chief was ‚Äúprofoundly unworthy‚Äù of wielding a lightsaber, and that ‚ÄúA Jedi acts selflessly for the common man-NOT lie 2 enrich giant corporations.‚Äù",
