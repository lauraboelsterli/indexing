GLOBAL TOP NEWS • U.S. sanctions Russians for meddling, but not Putin's oligarchs The United States slapped sanctions on Russian individuals and entities for U.S. election meddling and cyber attacks but put off targeting oligarchs and government officials close to President Vladimir Putin, prompting lawmakers in both parties to say President Donald Trump needs to do much more. • U.S. tech companies win changes in bill to limit China access to technology Lawmakers pushing legislation aimed at preventing China from acquiring sensitive U.S. technology have proposed relaxing elements of the measure after lobbying by high-tech firms but will tighten another portion, according to a draft revision seen by Reuters. • Rejecting protectionism, ASEAN and Australia commit to free trade The Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Australia reject protectionism and embrace free trade, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his Singapore counterpart Lee Hsien Loong said on Friday. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • The SGX Nifty Futures were trading at 10,323.00, down 0.4 percent from its previous close. • The Indian rupee will likely edge lower against the U.S. currency after the dollar index jumped by the most in a week before next week’s Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision. • Indian government bonds are likely to trade little changed in early trade amid expectation of a U.S. rate increase next week that may make investment in Indian debt less attractive. The yield on the benchmark 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in 7.61 percent - 7.66 percent band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • The S&P 500 ended slightly lower on Thursday after a report that U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller had issued a subpoena for documents related to U.S. President Donald Trump's businesses offset strong jobs and manufacturing data. • Asian stocks were on the defensive as worries over the U.S. investigation into the Trump Organization tested investor nerves, already frayed by fears U.S. tariffs could hurt the global economy and trigger a trade war. • The dollar held gains against a basket of peers, as recent concerns about the currency arising from trade tensions eased slightly and next week's Federal Reserve policy meeting came into focus. • The Treasury bond yield curve continued to flatten on Thursday as the surging spread between Libor and the overnight indexed swap rate pressured the short end of the curve, lifting the two-year yield to a decade high. • Oil prices crept higher after the International Energy Agency said global crude demand would accelerate this year, but warned supply is growing at a faster pace. • Gold prices held firm as tensions between the United Kingdom and Russia and renewed U.S. political concerns offset worries about a possible U.S. rate hike next week.
