    "text": "NEWTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- RMR Real Estate Income Fund (NYSE American: RIF) today announced its regular quarterly distribution to common shareholders. The distribution of $0.33 per common share will be paid on or about March 29, 2018 to holders of record of common shares as of the close of business on March 19, 2018.\nRIF declared this quarterly distribution pursuant to its level rate dividend policy. There is no assurance that RIF will always be able to pay a distribution of any particular size, or that a distribution will consist only of net investment income. RIF’s ability to maintain a level distribution will depend on a number of factors, including the stability of income received from its investments, availability of capital gains, distributions paid on its preferred shares and the level of RIF’s expenses including interest on RIF’s borrowings. In order to maintain a stable distribution amount, the distributions announced today, as well as future distributions, may consist of net investment income, realized capital gains and return of capital.\nIn compliance with Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, a notice will be provided for any distribution that does not consist solely of net investment income. Such a notice will be for informational purposes only, and will disclose, among other things, estimated portions of the distribution, if any, consisting of net investment income, capital gains and return of capital. Because RIF has substantial investments in real estate investment trusts, or REITs, which generally will characterize distributions to their shareholders, including RIF, subsequent to the end of a calendar year as ordinary income, net capital gain or return of capital, it is expected that distributions declared by RIF attributable to its investments in REITs will be similarly characterized for tax purposes subsequent to year end. Shareholders should not use the information provided in this press release or any notice delivered in compliance with Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 in preparing their tax returns. Shareholders will receive a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year indicating how to report distributions from RIF for U.S. Federal income tax purposes.\nRIF is a closed end investment company advised by RMR Advisors LLC. RMR Advisors LLC is a member of The RMR Group (Nasdaq: RMR), an alternative asset management company that is headquartered in Newton, MA.\nWARNINGS REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nTHIS PRESS RELEASE CONTAINS STATEMENTS THAT CONSTITUTE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 AND OTHER SECURITIES LAWS. THESE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED UPON RIF’S PRESENT INTENT, BELIEFS AND EXPECTATIONS, BUT FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEED TO OCCUR AND MAY NOT OCCUR FOR NUMEROUS REASONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND RIF’S CONTROL. FOR EXAMPLE:\nTHIS PRESS RELEASE DESCRIBES RIF’S DISTRIBUTION OF $0.33 PER SHARE AS A QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTION AND REFERS TO RIF’S LEVEL RATE DIVIDEND POLICY. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE STATEMENTS MAY BE THAT RIF WILL CONSISTENTLY PAY A DISTRIBUTION OF $0.33 PER SHARE FOR EACH QUARTER. IN FACT, THE AMOUNT OF DISTRIBUTIONS PAID BY RIF IN THE FUTURE WILL DEPEND PRIMARILY UPON RIF’S FUTURE EARNINGS. RIF CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE THAT ITS FUTURE EARNINGS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE RIF TO PAY A REGULAR QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTION OF $0.33 PER SHARE.\nFOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS, INVESTORS SHOULD NOT PLACE UNDUE RELIANCE UPON FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180309005761/en/\nRMR Funds\nJoselyn Fine, 617-796-8253\nInvestor Relations Analyst\nwww.rmrfunds.com\nSource: RMR Funds",
