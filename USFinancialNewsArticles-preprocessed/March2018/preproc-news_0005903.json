They broke a 10-game losing streak with a victory in Memphis on Wednesday.\nWestbrook tied the game at 116 on a layup with 1:32 left, and his 3-pointer gave the Thunder a 119-116 lead with 55.9 seconds remaining.\nAfter Jackson missed a long 3-pointer, Westbrook missed two shots but got the offensive rebound both times. The Thunder called a timeout with 22.5 seconds left.\nWestbrook was fouled and made one of two free throws with 18.2 seconds remaining, and he sealed the game on a dunk after the Thunder stripped Booker at the other end.\nThe Suns have lost 19 of 22 since beating Oklahoma City in Phoenix on Jan. 7. The teams meet in the final game of the season series Wednesday in Oklahoma City.\nPaul George had 20 points and Carmelo Anthony had 14 points and eight rebounds for the Thunder, who have won 14 of 21 while competing for a playoff spot in the tight Western Conference.\nWestbrook remains three triple-doubles short of becoming the fourth player in NBA history to reach 100. Oscar Robertson (181), Magic Johnson (138) and Jason Kidd (107) are the top three.\nBooker tied a season high with six 3-pointers, and he has scored 39, 34, 40, 30, 27 and 28 points in his last six games while making 23 threes. He missed the previous four games with a hip injury.\nSuns center Alex Len had seven points, eight rebounds and six blocked shots. Phoenix made 11 of 22 3-point attempts.\nBooker and Westbrook staged a tug-of-war in the first half, which ended with the Suns holding a 67-60 lead.\nBooker had 21 points, eight assists and four rebounds while making 9 of 12 field-goal attempts before the break. Westbrook had 19 points, seven rebounds and four assists while making 7 of 12 shots from the field prior to halftime.\nâ€”Field Level Media\n ",
