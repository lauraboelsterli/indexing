FILE PHOTO: Ben van Beurden, chief executive officer of Royal Dutch Shell, speaks during the 26th World Gas Conference in Paris, France, June 2, 2015. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/File Photo Speaking at the CERAWeek conference by IHS Markit in Houston, van Beurden said the energy sector will nevertheless need to reduce emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, from gas production operations or the case for the fuel as a lower carbon alternative would be “fatally undermined.” Shell, the world’s top trader of liquefied natural gas, currently produces around 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which roughly half is natural gas.
