    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alio Gold Inc (TSX:ALO) (NYSE AMERICAN:ALO) (“Alio Gold” or the “Company”) and Rye Patch Gold Corp. (TSX-V:RPM) (OTCQX:RPMGF) (FWB:5TN) (“Rye Patch”) are pleased to announce they have entered into an agreement whereby Alio Gold will acquire, through a plan of arrangement (the “Arrangement”) all of the outstanding shares of Rye Patch. Alio Gold will host a conference call at 11:00am EDT (Toronto) time today to discuss the transaction and the details of the call can be found at the end of the release. Management from both Alio Gold and Rye Patch will participate in the conference call.\nUnder the Arrangement, each common share of Rye Patch will be exchanged for 0.48 common shares of Alio Gold. The offer implies a value of C$1.57 per Rye Patch share, a 35% premium to Rye Patch shareholders, based on the 20-day volume weighted average trading price of Alio Gold shares on the TSX and Rye Patch shares on the TSX.V for the period ending March 16, 2018. The offer values Rye Patch’s outstanding equity (undiluted) at approximately C$128 million. The number of Alio Gold shares to be issued will be approximately 39.0 million based on the issued and outstanding shares as of the announcement date, subject to adjustment for options, warrants and restricted stock units vested prior to the Arrangement. The transaction is expected to close on or about May 25, 2018. Existing Alio Gold and Rye Patch shareholders will own approximately 53% and 47% of the combined company, respectively, following the close of the transaction.\nTransaction Highlights\nIncreased asset diversification – 165,000 ounces of gold production 1 in 2018 from two open-pit, heap leach operations in the stable jurisdictions of Sonora, Mexico and Nevada, USA Enhanced growth profile – potential for low-capital expansion to increase expected annual gold production at Florida Canyon Improved cash flow generation to support development project – cash flow generation from two mines to support development of the feasibility stage Ana Paula project which is anticipated to produce 115,000 ounces of gold per year 2 Enhanced capital markets profile and potential re-rating – increased market capitalization of the combined company has the ability to appeal to a broader shareholder base and improve share trading liquidity Strong balance sheet – combined pro forma entity has approximately $74 million in cash and equivalents 3 and $29 million in total debt 3\n“This transaction is consistent with our strategy to create a leading mid-tier precious metals company,” said Greg McCunn, CEO of Alio Gold. “In addition to diversifying our asset base into one of the most attractive precious metal producing regions in the world, this transaction provides us with increased scale and liquidity to drive long term shareholder value. We see regional growth opportunities in Nevada and coupled with our high-grade, high-margin Ana Paula project, this transaction establishes a strong platform for future growth.”\nIn conjunction with the proposed transaction, Macquarie Bank Limited (“MBL”) has agreed not to exercise its right to require immediate repayment of the existing Florida Canyon project loan as a result of this change of control, subject to certain conditions. At the closing of the transaction, the outstanding principal owing on the MBL project loan is expected to be $15 million. MBL and the Company have commenced discussions regarding a restructuring of the loan at or after closing of the transaction and MBL has provided indicative terms for such a restructuring which remain subject to credit approval. The indicative terms for the restructuring envision the principal remaining at the closing of the transaction will be repaid over 12 equal quarterly payments along with accrued interest. Project loan type covenants including forward-looking financial ratios, cash sweep for early repayment of the loan and debt service and capital reserve account requirements would be replaced with a corporate guarantee and security from Alio Gold and certain of its affiliates. The Company intends to continue to work with MBL to seek final credit approval ahead of the close of the transaction.\nBenefits to Rye Patch Shareholders\nImmediate up-front premium of approximately 35% based on the 20-day volume weighted average prices of both companies while maintaining meaningful equity participation Improved balance sheet with $45 million of pro forma net cash as at December 31, 2017 3 and the flexibility to support advancement of Rye Patch projects Asset diversification with exposure to a second producing asset and meaningful ownership in Alio Gold’s high-grade, high-margin Ana Paula project Expands operational capabilities, adding proven expertise in open pit mining and heap leaching Combined company provides significant revaluation potential as a diversified company with growth opportunities\n“When I founded Rye Patch twelve years ago, I envisioned creating a mid-tier, North American gold producer,” stated William C. Howald, Rye Patch’s President and CEO. “This business combination with Alio Gold achieves that goal and creates a company with gold mining operations located in two stellar mining jurisdictions, Mexico and Nevada, with tremendous exploration upside. The Alio Gold management team has a positive track record in Mexico and combined with Rye Patch will expect to repeat that success in Nevada.”\nBenefits to Alio Gold Shareholders\nStrengthens and de-risks portfolio with the addition of a second producing asset Establishes an operating presence in Nevada, providing further geopolitical diversification Provides near-term production growth while lowering combined cost profile Strengthens Alio Gold’s ability to generate free cash flow on a per share basis Incremental free cash flow to finance Ana Paula construction Adds significant exploration potential with a large, district scale land package and strong pipeline of development and exploration opportunities\nManagement and Board\nAlio Gold will continue to be managed by the executive team in Vancouver, Canada led by Greg McCunn as Chief Executive Officer and Colette Rustad as Chief Financial Officer. In addition, the Company will seek to retain Doug Jones from Rye Patch as its Chief Operating Officer.\nAlio Gold’s Board of Directors will continue to be led by Chairman, Bryan Coates and Alio Gold have invited two directors from Rye Patch, Tim Baker and John Mansanti, to join the combined board. Committees are expected to be reconstituted at the first board of directors’ meeting following the close of the transaction.\nBoards of Directors’ Recommendations\nThe Arrangement has been unanimously approved by the board of directors and the special committee of Rye Patch and will be subject, among other things, to the favourable vote of 66 2/3% of the Rye Patch common shares voted at a special meeting of shareholders called to approve the transaction. Officers and directors of Rye Patch as well as other shareholders including Primevest Capital Corp have entered into lock-up and support arrangements with Alio Gold under which they have agreed to vote in favour of the transaction.

Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements and information contained in this news release concerning these times.\nForward-looking information relating to future production, analyst coverage, liquidity, cash flow and potential revaluation of Alio Gold shares, future growth potential for Alio Gold, Rye Patch and their respective businesses, future mine development plans, estimates regarding the recovery of minerals, and estimates of production costs is based on management of the applicable parties’ reasonable assumptions, estimates, expectations, analyses and opinions, which are based on such management’s experience and perception of trends, current conditions and expected developments, and other factors that management believes are relevant and reasonable in the circumstances, but which may prove to be incorrect. Assumptions have been made regarding, among other things, the price of silver, gold, and other metals; costs of development and production; estimated production rates for gold and other metals produced by the parties; the estimated costs of development of development projects; Alio Gold and/or Rye Patch’s ability to operate in a safe and effective manner and their ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms.\nThese statements reflect the parties’ respective current views with respect to future events and are necessarily based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, while considered reasonable by the respective parties, are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties and contingencies. Many factors, both known and unknown, could cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from the results, performance or achievements that are or may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements or information and the parties have made assumptions and estimates based on or related to many of these factors. Such factors include, without limitation: satisfaction or waiver of all applicable conditions to closing of the Arrangement including, without limitation, receipt of all necessary shareholder, court, stock exchange, creditor and regulatory approvals or consents and lack of material changes with respect to Alio Gold and Rye Patch and their respective businesses, all as more particularly set forth in the Arrangement Agreement; the synergies expected from the Arrangement not being realized; business integration risks; fluctuations in general macro-economic conditions; fluctuations in securities markets and the market price of Alio Gold’s shares; fluctuations in the spot and forward price of gold and other metals or certain other commodities (such as natural gas, fuel oil and electricity); fluctuations in the currency markets (such as the Canadian dollar, Mexican peso and the U.S. dollar); changes in national and local government, legislation, taxation, controls, regulations and political or economic developments in Canada, the United States or Mexico; operating or technical difficulties in connection with mining or development activities; risks and hazards associated with the business of mineral exploration, development and mining (including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, unusual or unexpected formations, pressures, cave-ins and flooding); risks relating to the credit worthiness or financial condition of suppliers, refiners and other parties with whom the parties do business; inability to obtain adequate insurance to cover risks and hazards; and the presence of laws and regulations that may impose restrictions on mining, including those currently enacted in the United States and Mexico; employee relations; relationships with and claims by local communities and indigenous populations; availability and increasing costs associated with mining inputs and labour; the speculative nature of mineral exploration and development, including the risks of obtaining necessary licenses, permits and approvals from government authorities; diminishing quantities or grades of mineral reserves as properties are mined; title to properties; and the factors identified under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in Alio Gold’s Annual Information Form, and under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in Rye Patch’s Annual Information Form. In addition, the failure of a party to comply with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement may result in that party being required to pay a termination fee to the other party, the result of which could have a material adverse effect on the paying party’s financial position and results of operations and its ability to fund growth prospects and current operations.\nReaders are cautioned against attributing undue certainty to forward-looking statements or information. Although the parties have attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially, there may be other factors that cause results not to be anticipated, estimated or intended.
