(NASDAQ:SND) (the “Company” or “Smart Sand”), a pure-play, low-cost producer of high quality Northern White raw frac sand, today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n“As the market for frac sand improved during 2017, Smart Sand continued to deliver strong, positive financial results,” stated Charles Young, Chief Executive Officer. “During 2017, we operated at the highest utilization levels in our history, selling over 2.4 million tons of Northern White frac sand, resulting in record full-year revenue and net income. Our strategy remains centered on our ability to adapt quickly to the constantly changing industry landscape, while operating safely and efficiently to maximize profitability through all industry cycles. Operating at this record level would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of our talented employees. Our dedicated workforce, combined with our long-term take-or-pay contracts, low cost operating structure, and strategic investments in logistics infrastructure at our Oakdale facility, positions us well to continue to take advantage of the current positive market trends. From a strategic perspective, we continue to evaluate opportunities in both the Permian Basin and Bakken as well as last mile solutions to better serve our growing customer base and deliver value to our stockholders.”\nFull Year 2017 Highlights\nRevenues of $137.2 million for the full year 2017 were the highest in the history of the Company representing a 132% increase over full year 2016 revenue of $59.2 million. The increase in revenues was primarily due to higher sales volumes and higher freight revenues resulting from increased shipments to customers to whom we bill freight charges.\nOverall tons sold were approximately 2,449,000 in the full year 2017, nearly tripling full year 2016 volume of 826,000 tons.\nNet income was $21.5 million, or $0.54 per basic share and $0.53 per diluted share, for the full year 2017, compared with net income of $10.4 million, or $0.43 per basic share and $0.42 per diluted share, for the full year 2016, an increase of 107% year over year. Net income in 2017 included an $8.5 million tax expense benefit for the full year 2017 due to the changes in the U.S. tax laws that were enacted in December 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $30.6 million for the full year 2017 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $37.8 million for the full year 2016, a decrease of 19% year over year. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to lower shortfall revenue of $19.7 million in 2017 and higher operating expenses due to the substantial growth in sales and production activity in 2017, weather related unplanned downtime and maintenance expenses and non-recurring expenses associated with such growth, partially offset by the higher sales volumes.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nRevenues of $43.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, were also the highest in Company history and represented a 46% increase over fourth quarter 2016 revenue of $29.5 million. Fourth quarter 2017 revenue increased by 9% compared to third quarter 2017 revenue of $39.3 million. The increase in revenues was primarily due to higher sales volumes and higher freight revenues, resulting from increased shipments to customers to whom we bill freight charges.\nOverall tons sold were approximately 706,400 in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with approximately 274,500 tons sold in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 653,400 tons for the third quarter of 2017, increases of 157% and 8%, respectively.\nThe Company generated net income of $10.9 million, or $0.27 per basic and diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with net income of $12.4 million, or $0.40 per basic and diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016 and net income of $7.0 million, or $0.17 per basic and diluted share, for the third quarter of 2017. As highlighted above, we had a one-time tax benefit that was booked in the fourth quarter 2017 due to the changes in the U.S. tax laws that were enacted in December 2017. In addition, we had shortfall revenue of $17.9 million and other income of $8.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to a one-time settlement and sale of an unsecured bankruptcy claim with a former customer.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $8.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $27.0 million during the same period last year, a decrease of 67% on a year-over-year basis and a decrease of 23% compared to third quarter of 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $11.6 million. The decrease in net income and Adjusted EBITDA compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 was primarily due to lower shortfall revenue, partially offset by higher sales volume. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA compared to the third quarter 2017 was primarily due to higher operating expenses from weather related unplanned downtime and maintenance expense as well as higher operating expenses that we typically incur during the fourth quarter and first quarter of each year. During these periods, we absorb less of our operating costs into inventory due to running our wet plant less during the winter months. These increased costs were partially offset by higher sales volumes.\nCapital Expenditures\nSmart Sand’s capital expenditures totaled $23.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and totaled approximately $51.1 million for the full year 2017, and were associated largely with the Company’s expansion at its Oakdale sand processing facility and investment in various enhancement and cost improvement projects. The Company estimates that capital expenditures will be approximately $85 to 95 million in 2018, of which $45.7 million relates to capital expenditure carryover from 2017 to complete the expansion of our Oakdale facility to 5.5 million tons of dry nameplate sand processing capacity. This expansion is expected to be completed and operational in the second quarter of 2018. At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $35.2 million on cash at hand and an unfunded $45.0 million revolver available to support liquidity needs in 2018.\nTax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform Act”) was signed into law. The Tax Reform Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax regime by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, repealing the deduction for domestic production activities and implementing 100% direct expensing of certain non-residential property. U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) require that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted.\nAs a result of the Tax Reform Act, the Company recorded a benefit of approximately $8.5 million due to a re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. There are additional provisions in the Tax Reform Act that could impact the Company that will continue to be monitored as additional guidance is released. The tax benefit represents provisional amounts and the Company’s current best estimates. Any adjustments recorded to the provisional amounts through the first quarter of fiscal 2019 will be included in income from operations as an adjustment to tax expense. The provisional amounts incorporate assumptions made based upon the Company’s current interpretation of the Tax Reform Act and may change as additional clarification and implementation guidance is provided.\nConference Call\nSmart Sand will host a conference call and live webcast for analysts and investors this morning, March 15 th , at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, plus (i) gain or loss on sale of fixed assets or discontinued operations, (ii) integration and transition costs associated with specified transactions, including our IPO, (iii) equity compensation; (iv) development costs; (v) non-recurring cash charges related to restructuring, retention and other similar actions, (vi) earnout and contingent consideration obligations, and (vii) non-cash charges and unusual or non-recurring charges. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess:\nthe financial performance of our assets without regard to the impact of financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis of our assets; the viability of capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities; our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; our operating performance as compared to those of other companies in our industry without regard to the impact of financing methods and capital structure; and our debt covenant compliance as Adjusted EBITDA is a key component of critical covenants in our credit agreement.\nWe believe that our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA will provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. Net income is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered alternatives to net income presented in accordance with GAAP. Because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to net income for each of the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 (in thousands) Net (loss) income $ 10,886 $ 7,047 $ 12,441 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 2,184 1,756 1,624 Income tax expense (benefit) (6,165 ) 1,686 9,445 Interest expense 174 172 983 Franchise taxes 31 70 2 EBITDA $ 7,110 $ 10,731 $ 24,495 Gain (loss) on sale of fixed assets (1) 66 30 - Integration and transition costs - 16 - Initial public offering related costs (2) - - 725 Equity compensation (3) 495 516 706 Development costs (4) 766 79 - Cash charges related to restructuring and retention (5) 40 239 - Non-cash charges (6) 453 20 3 Loss on extinguishment of debt (7) - - 1,051 Adjusted EBITDA $ 8,930 $ 11,631 $ 26,980 (1) Includes losses related to the sale and disposal of certain assets in property, plant and equipment. (2) For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred $725 of IPO related bonuses. (3) Represents the non-cash expenses for stock-based awards issued to our employees and employee stock purchase plan compensation expense. (4) Represents costs related to current development project activities. (5) Represents costs associated with the retention and relocation of employees. (6) Represents accretion of asset retirement obligations and loss on derivatives. (7) Reflects the loss on extinguishment of debt related to our November 2016 financing transaction.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 2016 (in thousands) Net Income $ 21,526 $ 10,379 Depreciation and depletion 7,300 6,445 Income tax expense (2,809 ) 9,394 Interest expense 700 8,436 Franchise taxes 339 21 EBITDA $ 27,056 $ 34,675 Gain (loss) on sale of fixed assets (1) 253 (59 ) Integration and transition costs 16 - Initial public offering related costs (2) - 725 Equity compensation (3) 1,652 1,426 Development costs (4) 845 - Cash charges related to restructuring and retention (5) 279 - Non-cash charges (6) 514 21 Loss on extinguishment of debt (7) - 1,051 Adjusted EBITDA $ 30,615 $ 37,839 (1) Includes losses related to the sale and disposal of certain assets in property, plant and equipment. (2) For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred $725 of IPO related bonuses. (3) Represents the non-cash expenses for stock-based awards issued to our employees and employee stock purchase plan compensation expense. (4) Represents costs related to current development project activities. (5) Represents costs associated with the retention and relocation of employees. (6) Represents accretion of asset retirement obligations and loss on derivatives. (7) Reflects the loss on extinguishment of debt related to our November 2016 financing transaction. Production Costs\nWe also use production costs, which we define as costs of goods sold, excluding depreciation, depletion, accretion of asset retirement obligations and freight charges to measure our financial performance. Freight charges consist of shipping costs and railcar rental and storage expenses. Shipping costs consist of railway transportation and transload costs to deliver products to customers. A portion of these freight charges are passed through to our customers and are, therefore, included in revenue. Rail car rental and storage expenses are associated with our long-term rail car operating agreements with certain customers. We believe production costs is a meaningful measure to management and external users of our financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, because it provides a measure of operating performance that is unaffected by historical cost basis and logistics charges that vary by customer. Cost of goods sold is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to production costs. Production costs should not be considered an alternative to cost of goods sold presented in accordance with GAAP. Because production costs may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of production costs may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of production costs to cost of goods sold:\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 (in thousands) Cost of goods sold $ 32,938 $ 26,297 $ 8,770 Depreciation, depletion, and accretion of asset retirement obligations (2,490 ) (1,628 ) (1,485 ) Freight charges (1) (20,009 ) (17,624 ) (2,995 ) Production costs 10,439 7,045 4,290 Production costs per ton $ 14.79 $ 10.79 $ 15.66 Total tons sold 706 653 274 (1) Certain costs in 2016 were reclassified to freight charges to conform to the current financial statement presentation. These reclassifications have no effect on previous reported cost of goods sold.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 2016 (in thousands) Cost of goods sold $ 100,304 $ 26,569 Depreciation, depletion, and accretion of asset retirement obligations (7,289 ) (6,076 ) Freight charges (1) (59,684 ) (7,924 ) Production costs 33,331 12,569 Production costs per ton $ 13.61 $ 15.22 Total tons sold 2,449 826 (1) Certain costs in 2016 were reclassified to freight charges to conform to the current financial statement presentation.
