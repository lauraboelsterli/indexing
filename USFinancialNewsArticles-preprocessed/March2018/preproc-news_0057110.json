    "text": "(Reuters) - Park Sung-hyun eagled the par-four 15th hole en route to an “awesome” eight-under-par 64 and a share of the second-round clubhouse lead at the ANA Inspiration in Rancho Mirage, California on Friday.\nMar 30, 2018; Rancho Mirage, CA, USA; Sung Hyun Park attempts a putt on the 18th hole during the second round of the ANA Inspiration women's golf tournament at Mission Hills CC - Dinah Shore Tournament Course. Mandatory Credit: Kelvin Kuo-USA TODAY Sports South Korean Park, the U.S. Women’s Open champion, joined Swede Pernilla Lindberg at 12-under 132 on another morning of ideal conditions at Mission Hills.\nLindberg, the first round leader, followed her opening 65 with a bogey-free 67.\nThe leading duo had a substantial five-shot advantage over Englishwomen Jodi Ewart Shadoff (67) and Charley Hull (68) and American Amy Olson (68) with half the field back in the clubhouse.\nSelf-coached Park said she had not even been aware of her score.\n“I just was so focused on my game today,” she told reporters.\nMar 30, 2018; Rancho Mirage, CA, USA; Sung Hyun Park reacts after her putt on the 18th hole during the second round of the ANA Inspiration women's golf tournament at Mission Hills CC - Dinah Shore Tournament Course. Mandatory Credit: Kelvin Kuo-USA TODAY Sports “I was super focused at the U.S. Open, and felt just as focused for today’s round.\n“Today the shots were awesome. I just felt really good about my driver.”\nBut it was a wedge shot that brought about the highlight of her day at the 15th, where her approach from 102 yards landed beyond the hole, took a couple of bounces and then rolled back into the cup.\n“I just felt really good about the distance and saw that it had really great backspin, but I didn’t even see it go in,” she said.\nMar 30, 2018; Rancho Mirage, CA, USA; Sung Hyun Park tees off on the 17th hole during the second round of the ANA Inspiration women's golf tournament at Mission Hills CC - Dinah Shore Tournament Course. Mandatory Credit: Kelvin Kuo-USA TODAY Sports Not long after Park’s eagle, American Morgan Pressel replicated the feat, her ball landing short of the hole and one-hopping into the cup.\nPressel shot 69 for one-over 145.\nAmerican Lexi Thompson (72) struggled on the greens but almost holed her eagle approach shot at the last, tapping in for birdie to trail by eight shots.\nThompson dominated pre-tournament media coverage thanks to a rules violation that effectively cost her victory last year, when she lost to Ryu So-yeon in a playoff.\nThat infringement had led to a four-stroke penalty — two for replacing her ball in the wrong spot for a tap-in putt, and two more for signing her third-round scorecard before the violation was brought to the attention of officials.\nA more alert Thompson played the first two rounds this week with fellow American Michelle Wie (67), who made the cut in a nice comeback after an opening 75 during which she suffered dizziness.\nShe joked after her first round that blurred vision had left her seeing several balls as she stood over some shots.\n“I definitely saw one golf ball today, which was good,” she said, adding that she had tried to conserve energy. “I sat down every chance I could.\n“I just talked to the doctor last night, and he said it’s definitely some kind of ear virus thing, and definitely having a little bit of vertigo going.”\nReporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina, editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ",
