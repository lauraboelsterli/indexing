    "text": "96 COMMENTS Does my wheelchair feel like a prison? Do I ever wish I weren’t disabled? Would I choose to become able-bodied if I could?\nThose are a few of the things people have asked upon meeting me. My answer is always the same: a strong and unequivocal “no.” I’ve never fully understood the mentality behind the questions, much less the shocked reactions to my replies.\nAnd then I saw the response to Stephen Hawking’s death last week, when people sighed with relief that one of the most brilliant minds of our generation was finally “free of any physical constraints,” as the actress Gal Gadot tweeted. One meme depicted an empty wheelchair in the foreground, with a silhouette of Hawking standing amid the stars.\nHawking advanced the science of black holes and quantum mechanics, earning admiration from peers in his field and the general public alike. But all that seems to have been overshadowed by the stereotypes of people with disabilities. Instead of discussing his groundbreaking achievements, many people have reduced Hawking to a victim of his disability who’s fortunate to be dead.\nPeople with disabilities are anything but victims. I was born with Freeman-Sheldon syndrome, a genetic bone and muscular disorder that has left me unable to walk. I got my first wheelchair in first grade. It wasn’t fancy by any means, but it changed my life forever. The world came alive for the first time, in all kinds of vivid colors. I went from observing what happened around me to participating actively in it.\nMy wheelchair has carried me—literally—through high school, college and work as a freelance writer. I wouldn’t have been able to do any of this without it. After all, it gives me the ability to travel, go shopping and live independently—activities that might seem routine but can be extremely challenging for people with disabilities.\nMaybe that’s why it’s so frustrating to see Hawking’s wheelchair viewed as a prison he has finally escaped. The idea that wheelchairs hold people back is such an outdated misconception; in fact, they do just the opposite. They’re not a hindrance. They’re incredible tools that give people with disabilities new freedom and power—a chance to thrive in an able-bodied world. To see them as anything less is insulting to those who depend on them every day.\nSo, yes, I most certainly do take pride in my wheelchair. That may sound strange, since pride and disability aren’t usually seen as going together. But no matter how foreign the idea may seem, it’s possible to love a disability and be comfortable in a disabled body. My wheelchair actually makes me feel even more “at home” in my own skin.\nI’ve had several wheelchairs since that first one, and each has been a part of me in the best way possible. I’m in the driver’s seat of my life, thanks to them all. Hawking was in charge of his life too—and that’s definitely something worth celebrating.\nMs. Blake is a freelance writer from Illinois who covers disability and women’s issues.\nAppeared in the March 21, 2018, print edition.",
