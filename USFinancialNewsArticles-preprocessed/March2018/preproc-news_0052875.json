    "text": "(Reuters) - Headsets maker Plantronics Inc ( PLT.N ) said on Wednesday it would buy video conferencing equipment maker Polycom in a $2 billion deal, as it aims to take a bigger share of the market for providing businesses with a one-stop shop for managing their communications.\nThe deal will help Plantronics offer messaging systems, email, conferencing, telephone and services in a single system, a market it said was worth $40 billion.\nThe cash-and-stock deal comprises about $948 million in cash and Plantronics shares worth $358 million, as well as $690 million in debt.\nPolycom was taken private in 2016 by Siris Capital Group for $1.7 billion, ending a three-month old deal with Canada’s Mitel Networks Corp.\nPolycom shareholders will own about 16 percent of the combined company.\nThe transaction is expected to immediately add to Plantronics’ adjusted earnings, and will save $75 million annually within one year of the deal’s closing.\nPlantronics said it intends to fund the cash portion of the offer with cash on hand and about $1.375 billion in debt financing.\nSiris Capital’s founder and managing partner, Frank Baker, and its executive partner, Daniel Moloney, will join Plantronics board.\nThe deal has been unanimously approved by the boards of both the companies, and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2018.\nWells Fargo Securities is the lead financial adviser to Plantronics and Foley & Lardner LLP is the legal adviser.\nMoelis & Co LLC and Macquarie Capital are financial advisers to Polycom, while Sidley Austin LLP its legal adviser.\nReporting by Sonam Rai in Bengaluru; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty\n ",
