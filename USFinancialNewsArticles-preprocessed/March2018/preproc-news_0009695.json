    "text": "Record Revenues and Income from Operations\nWATERLOO, Ontario, The Descartes Systems Group Inc. (TSX:DSG) (Nasdaq:DSGX) announced its financial results for its fiscal 2018 fourth quarter (Q4FY18) and year (FY18) ended January 31, 2018. All financial results referenced are in United States (US) currency and, unless otherwise indicated, are determined in accordance with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).\n“Our focus on helping our customers manage the lifecycle of shipments across transportation modes, geographies and commodities makes us an ideal home for logistics-intensive customers and complementary businesses,” said Edward J. Ryan, Descartes’ CEO. “As a result, FY18 continued the expansion of the customers connected to, and the solutions available over, our Global Logistics Network. We believe we have a solid, neutral platform for continued growth and acquisitions, with the experience and capital capacity to continue to increase the GLN’s influence.”\nFY18 Financial Results\nAs described in more detail below, key financial highlights for Descartes’ twelve-month period ended January 31, 2018 (FY18) included:\nRevenues of $237.4 million, up 16% from $203.8 million in the same period a year ago (FY17); Revenues were comprised of license revenues of $8.1 million (3% of total revenues) and services revenues (non-license) of $229.3 million (97% of total revenues). Services revenues were up 16% from $196.9 million in FY17; Cash provided by operating activities of $72.1 million, down from $72.6 million in FY17; Net income of $26.9 million, up 13% from $23.8 million in FY17. Net income as a percentage of revenues was 11%, compared to 12% in FY17; Earnings per share on a diluted basis of $0.35, up 13% from $0.31 in FY17; and Adjusted EBITDA of $80.8 million, up 15% from $70.1 million in FY17. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues was 34%, compared to 34% in FY17.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues are non-GAAP financial measures provided as a complement to financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation (for which we include related fees and taxes) and other charges (for which we include restructuring charges and acquisition-related expenses). These items are considered by management to be outside Descartes' ongoing operational results. We define Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues as the quotient, expressed as a percentage, from dividing Adjusted EBITDA for a period by revenues for the corresponding period. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues to net income determined in accordance with GAAP is provided later in this release.\nThe following table summarizes Descartes’ results in the categories specified below over FY18 and FY17 (dollar amounts, other than per share amounts, in millions):\nFY18 FY17 Revenues 237.4 203.8 Services revenues 229.3 196.9 Gross margin 73 % 72 % Cash provided by operating activities 72.1 72.6 Net income 26.9 23.8 Net income as a % of revenues 11 % 12 % Earnings per diluted share 0.35 0.31 Adjusted EBITDA 80.8 70.1 Adjusted EBITDA as a % of revenues 34 % 34 % Q4FY18 Financial Results\nAs described in more detail below, key financial highlights for Descartes’ three-month period ended January 31, 2018 (Q4FY18) included:\nRevenues of $63.6 million, up 20% from $52.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 (Q4FY17) and up 3% from $62.0 million in the previous quarter (Q3FY18); Revenues were comprised of license revenues of $2.0 million (3% of total revenues) and services revenues (non-license) of $61.6 million (97% of total revenues). Services revenues were up 20% from $51.4 million in Q4FY17 and up 3% from $59.7 million in Q3FY18; Cash provided by operating activities of $19.6 million, up 1% from $19.5 million in Q4FY17 and up 4% from $18.9 million in Q3FY18; Net income of $6.7 million, up 10% from $6.1 million in Q4FY17 and up 8% from $6.2 million in Q3FY18. Net income as a percentage of revenues was 11%, compared to 12% in Q4FY17 and 10% in Q3FY18; Earnings per share on a diluted basis of $0.09, up 13% from $0.08 in Q4FY17 and up 13% from $0.08 in Q3FY18; and Adjusted EBITDA of $21.4 million, up 16% from $18.5 million in Q4FY17 and up 4% from $20.6 million in Q3FY18. Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues was 34%, compared to 35% in Q4FY17 and 33% in Q3FY18.\nThe following table summarizes Descartes' results in the categories specified below over the past 5 fiscal quarters (unaudited; dollar amounts, other than per share amounts, in millions):\nQ4\nFY18 Q3\nFY18 Q2\nFY18 Q1\nFY18 Q4\nFY17 Revenues 63.6 62.0 57.3 54.5 52.8 Services revenues 61.6 59.7 55.1 52.8 51.4 Gross margin 73 % 73 % 73 % 74 % 72 % Cash provided by operating activities 19.6 18.9 17.1 16.5 19.5 Net income 6.7 6.2 7.2 6.9 6.1 Net income as a % of revenues 11 % 10 % 13 % 13 % 12 % Earnings per diluted share 0.09 0.08 0.09 0.09 0.08 Adjusted EBITDA 21.4 20.6 19.8 19.0 18.5 Adjusted EBITDA as a % of revenues 34 % 33 % 35 % 35 % 35 % Cash Position\nAt January 31, 2018, Descartes had $35.1 million in cash. Cash increased $1.8 million in Q4FY18 primarily due to cash provided from operations partially offset by credit facility repayments. Cash decreased $3.0 in FY18 primarily due to cash used to acquire ShipRush, PCSTrac and MacroPoint, partially offset by proceeds from borrowing on the credit facility and cash provided by operating activities\nThe table set forth below provides a summary of cash flows for Q4FY18 and FY18 in millions of dollars:\nQ4FY18 FY18 Cash provided by operating activities 19.6 72.1 Additions to property and equipment (1.2 ) (5.1 ) Acquisitions of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired - (111.9 ) Proceeds from borrowing on credit facility - 80.0 Credit facility repayments (18.0 ) (43.0 ) Issuances of common shares, net of issuance costs - 1.0 Effect of foreign exchange rate on cash 1.4 3.9 Net change in cash 1.8 (3.0 ) Cash, beginning of period 33.3 38.1 Cash, end of period 35.1 35.1 Acquisition of Aljex\nOn February 2, 2018, Descartes acquired Aljex Software, Inc. (“Aljex”), a cloud-based provider of back-office transportation management solutions for freight brokers and transportation providers. US-based Aljex helps customers automate business processes and create electronic documents critical for executing transportation moves through the lifecycle of a shipment. The purchase price for the acquisition was approximately $32.4 million, net of cash acquired, which was funded from drawing on our existing credit facility.\nDescartes Evolution — 2018 User Group Conference\nDescartes will be hosting Descartes Evolution at the Hilton West Palm Beach from March 6-8, 2018.

These forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions including the following: global shipment volumes continuing to increase at levels consistent with the average growth rates of the global economy; countries continuing to implement and enforce existing and additional customs and security regulations relating to the provision of electronic information for imports and exports; countries continuing to implement and enforce existing and additional trade restrictions and sanctioned party lists with respect to doing business with certain countries, organizations, entities and individuals; Descartes' continued operation of a secure and reliable business network; the stability of general economic and market conditions, currency exchange rates, and interest rates; equity and debt markets continuing to provide Descartes with access to capital; Descartes' continued ability to identify and source attractive and executable business combination opportunities; Descartes' ability to develop solutions that keep pace with the continuing changes in technology, and our continued compliance with third party intellectual property rights. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Descartes, or developments in Descartes' business or industry, to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or achievements or developments expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, Descartes' ability to successfully execute on acquisitions and to integrate acquired businesses and assets, and to predict expenses associated with and revenues from acquisitions; the ability to attract and retain key personnel and the ability to manage the departure of key personnel and the transition of our executive management team; changes in trade or transportation regulations that currently require customers to use services such as those offered by Descartes; the impact on Descartes' business of a global economic downturn; changes in customer behaviour and expectations; Descartes’ ability to successfully design and develop enhancements to our products and solutions; departures of key customers; the impact of foreign currency exchange rates; Descartes' ability to retain or obtain sufficient capital in addition to its debt facility to execute on its business strategy, including its acquisition strategy; disruptions in the movement of freight; the potential for future goodwill or intangible asset impairment as a result of other-than-temporary decreases in Descartes' market capitalization; and other factors and assumptions discussed in the section entitled, \"Certain Factors That May Affect Future Results\" in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Ontario Securities Commission and other securities commissions across Canada, including Descartes' most recently filed Management's Discussion and Analysis. If any such risks actually occur, they could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In that case, the trading price of our common shares could decline, perhaps materially. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. Readers are cautioned that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, except as required by law.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues\nWe prepare and release quarterly unaudited and annual audited financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We also disclose and discuss certain non-GAAP financial information, used to evaluate our performance, in this and other earnings releases and investor conference calls as a complement to results provided in accordance with GAAP. We believe that current shareholders and potential investors in our company use non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues, in making investment decisions about our company and measuring our operational results.\nThe term “Adjusted EBITDA” refers to a financial measure that we define as earnings before certain charges that management considers to be non-operating expenses and which consist of interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation (for which we include related fees and taxes) and other charges (for which we include restructuring charges and acquisition-related expenses). Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues divides Adjusted EBITDA for a period by the revenues for the corresponding period and expresses the quotient as a percentage.\nManagement considers these non-operating expenses to be outside the scope of Descartes’ ongoing operations and the related expenses are not used by management to measure operations. Accordingly, these expenses are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA, which we reference to both measure our operations and as a basis of comparison of our operations from period-to-period. Management believes that investors and financial analysts measure our business on the same basis, and we are providing the Adjusted EBITDA financial metric to assist in this evaluation and to provide a higher level of transparency into how we measure our own business. However, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues are non-GAAP financial measures and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues should not be construed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP or other non-GAAP measures that may be used by other companies, such as EBITDA. The use of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues does have limitations. In particular, we have completed seven acquisitions since the beginning of fiscal 2017 and may complete additional acquisitions in the future that will result in acquisition-related expenses and restructuring charges. As these acquisition-related expenses and restructuring charges may continue as we pursue our consolidation strategy, some investors may consider these charges and expenses as a recurring part of operations rather than expenses that are not part of operations.\nThe table below reconciles Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues to net income reported in our unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations for Q4FY18, Q3FY18, Q2FY18, Q1FY18 and Q4FY17, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n(US dollars in millions) Q4FY18 Q3FY18 Q2FY18 Q1FY18 Q4FY17 Net income , as reported on\nConsolidated Statements of Operations 6.7 6.2 7.2 6.9 6.1 Adjustments to reconcile to Adjusted\nEBITDA: Interest expense 0.4 0.5 0.1 0.1 0.1 Investment income (0.1 ) (0.1 ) - - - Income tax expense 1.9 1.8 2.0 2.2 1.9 Depreciation expense 1.3 1.1 0.9 0.8 1.1 Amortization of intangible assets 9.1 8.9 7.8 7.7 7.8 Stock-based compensation and\nrelated taxes 1.1 0.8 0.9 0.6 0.6 Other charges 1.0 1.4 0.9 0.7 0.9 Adjusted EBITDA 21.4 20.6 19.8 19.0 18.5 Revenues 63.6 62.0 57.3 54.5 52.8 Net income as % of revenues 11 % 10 % 13 % 13 % 12 % Adjusted EBITDA as % of revenues 34 % 33 % 35 % 35 % 35 % The table below reconciles Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues to net income reported in our unaudited Consolidated Statements of Operations for FY18 and FY17, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP measure.\n(US dollars in millions) FY18 FY17 Net income , as reported on Consolidated\nStatements of Operations 26.9 23.8 Adjustments to reconcile to Adjusted EBITDA: Interest expense 1.2 0.6 Investment income (0.2 ) (1.4 ) Income tax expense 7.9 7.7 Depreciation expense 4.1 3.6 Amortization of intangible assets 33.5 30.0 Stock-based compensation and related taxes 3.4 2.4 Other charges 4.0 3.4 Adjusted EBITDA 80.8 70.1 Revenues 237.4 203.8 Net income as % of revenues 11 % 12 % Adjusted EBITDA as % of revenues 34 % 34 %\nThe Descartes Systems Group Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(US dollars in thousands;
