While we are only at the very beginning of our evolution of the J.Crew brand, meaningful change is happening and we are already seeing results in our most important business – women's apparel – signaling that our strategy is working. With the right strategy and leadership in place, we are uniquely prepared to respond to the growing customer preference for a more personalized experience. We will scale Madewell more rapidly, building upon its proven and consistent record of growth, through strategic investments with highly profitable returns. We are a house of American brands, J.Crew our most iconic, all with significant opportunity to expand and enhance our product range while engaging our customers in more meaningful ways.\"\nFiscal 2017 highlights:\nTotal revenues decreased 2% to $2,370.1 million, which includes $28.6 million generated in the 53 rd week.

An explanation of the manner in which the Company uses adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures are included in Exhibit (3).\nBalance Sheet highlights:\nCash and cash equivalents were $107.1 million compared to $132.2 million at the end of the fourth quarter last year. The cash balance at the end of the fourth quarter this year reflects the payment of transaction costs of $36.6 million and debt repayments pursuant to the refinancing of $27.0 million. Inventories were $292.5 million compared to $314.5 million at the end of the fourth quarter last year. Inventories decreased 7% and inventories per square foot increased 1% compared to the end of the fourth quarter last year. Total debt, net of discount and deferred financing costs, was $1,713 million compared to $1,510 million at the end of the fourth quarter last year. On July 13, 2017, the Company completed a debt exchange and refinancing. For more information, see the section entitled \"Debt Exchange and Refinancing\" below. There were no outstanding borrowings under the ABL Facility at February 3, 2018 or January 28, 2017. As of the date of this release, there were outstanding borrowings of $27 million under the ABL Facility, with excess availability of approximately $210 million.\nDebt Exchange and Refinancing\nOn July 13, 2017, the Company completed the following interrelated liability management transactions:\nPrivate Exchange Offer. An exchange offer in which $565.7 million principal outstanding of 7.75%/8.50% Senior PIK Toggle Notes due 2019 (the \"PIK Notes\") issued by the Company's parent were exchanged for (i) $249.6 million of 13% Senior Secured Notes due 2021 and (ii) shares of preferred and common stock of the Company's parent. Term Loan Amendment. An amendment of the Company's Term Loan Facility to, among other things, facilitate the following related transactions: the repayment of $150.5 million principal amount then outstanding under the Term Loan Facility; the transfer of the remaining undivided ownership interest in the U.S. intellectual property rights of the J.Crew brand to a subsidiary of the Company which, together with the undivided ownership interest transferred in December 2016 represent 100% of the U.S. intellectual property rights of the J.Crew brand, and the execution of related license agreements; the issuance of $97.0 million principal amount of an additional series of 13% Senior Secured Notes due 2021, subject to the same terms and conditions as the exchange notes, for cash at a 3% discount, the proceeds of which were loaned to the Company and were applied, in part, to finance the repayment of the $150.5 million principal amount of term loans referenced above; and the raising of additional borrowings under the Term Loan Facility of $30.0 million, for cash at a 2% discount, provided by the Company's sponsors, the net proceeds of which were also applied, in part, to finance the repayment of the $150.5 million principal amount of term loans referenced above.\nFor more information on the Private Exchange Offer and Term Loan Amendment, see the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2017 Impairment\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $129.8 million related to the intangible asset for the J.Crew trade name. After recording the impairment charge in the first quarter, the carrying value of the J.Crew trade name was $250.2 million. If revenues or operating results decline below the Company's current expectations, additional impairment charges may be recorded in the future.\nThis impairment charge does not have an effect on the Company's operations, liquidity or financial covenants, and does not change management's long-term strategy, which includes its plans to drive disciplined growth across its brands.\nRelated Party\nOn November 4, 2013, an indirect parent holding company of the Company (the \"PIK Notes Issuer\") issued $500 million of PIK Notes. On July 13, 2017, the Company completed a private exchange offer pursuant to which $565.7 million principal amount of such PIK Notes were exchanged for $249.6 million of exchange notes and shares of preferred and common stock of the Parent.\nThe PIK Notes were not guaranteed by any of the PIK Notes Issuer's subsidiaries, and therefore were not recorded in the Company's financial statements. The exchange notes, however, are guaranteed by the Company's subsidiaries, and therefore are recorded in the Company's financial statements.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis announcement includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. An explanation of the manner in which the Company uses adjusted EBITDA and an associated reconciliation to comparable GAAP measures is included in Exhibit (3).\nConference Call Information\nA conference call to discuss fourth quarter results is scheduled for today, March 27, 2018, at 4:30 PM Eastern Time.

The Company believes the presentation of this measure will enhance the ability of its investors to analyze trends in its business, evaluate its performance relative to other companies in the industry, and evaluate its ability to service debt.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and therefore, differences may exist in the manner in which other companies calculate this measure. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to (i) net income, as a measure of operating performance, or (ii) cash flows, as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation to, or as a substitute for, analysis of the Company's results as measured in accordance with GAAP.\nExhibit (4)\nActual and Projected Store Count and Square Footage(1)\n(unaudited)\nFiscal 2017 (Actual)\nPeriod\nTotal stores open at\nbeginning of the\nperiod\nNumber of stores\nopened during the\nperiod(2)\nNumber of stores\nclosed during the\nperiod(2)\nTotal stores open at end\nof the period\nFirst Quarter\n573\n3\n(5)\n571\nSecond Quarter\n571\n4\n(2)\n573\nThird Quarter\n573\n3\n(4)\n572\nFourth Quarter\n572\n—\n(40)\n532\nFiscal 2017\n573\n10\n(51)\n532\nFiscal 2017 (Actual)\nPeriod\nTotal gross square feet\nat beginning of the\nperiod\nGross square feet\nfor stores opened or\nexpanded during the\nperiod\nReduction of gross\nsquare feet for stores\nclosed or downsized\nduring the period\nTotal gross square feet\nat end of the period\nFirst Quarter\n3,162,420\n8,934\n(25,730)\n3,145,624\nSecond Quarter\n3,145,624\n16,027\n(7,528)\n3,154,123\nThird Quarter\n3,154,123\n11,960\n(22,271)\n3,143,812\nFourth Quarter\n3,143,812\n—\n(217,742)\n2,926,070\nFiscal 2017\n3,162,420\n36,921\n(273,271)\n2,926,070\nFiscal 2018 (Projected)\nTotal stores open at\nbeginning of the\nyear\nNumber of stores\nopened during the\nyear(3)\nNumber of stores\nclosed during the\nyear(4)\nTotal stores open at end\nof the year\nFiscal year\n532\n11\n(20)\n523\nFiscal 2018 (Projected)\nTotal gross square feet\nat beginning of the\nyear\nGross square feet\nfor stores opened or\nexpanded during the\nyear\nReduction of gross\nsquare feet for stores\nclosed or downsized\nduring the year\nTotal gross square feet\nat end of the year\nFiscal year\n2,926,070\n34,000\n(109,000)\n2,851,070\n(1)\nStore count and square footage summary excludes two concession stores located in the United Kingdom and France.\n(2)\nActual number of stores open or closed during fiscal 2017 is as follows:\nRetail\nFactory\nMercantile\nMadewell\nInternational\nTotal\nOpen\n1\n1\n—\n8\n—\n10\nConversion to J.Crew Mercantile\n(3)\n—\n3\n—\n—\n—\nClose\n(39)\n(9)\n—\n—\n(3)\n(51)\nNet\n(41)\n(8)\n3\n8\n(3)\n(41)\n(3)\nThe Company projects to open one retail and 10 Madewell stores during fiscal 2018.\n(4)\nThe Company expects to close approximately 20 stores during fiscal 2018.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jcrew-group-inc-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-2017-results-300620534.html\nSOURCE J.Crew Group, Inc.",
