Foti, Jr., remind investors that they have until May 1, 2018 to file lead plaintiff applications in a securities class action lawsuit against Ulta Beauty, Inc. (NasdaqGS: ULTA), if they purchased the Company’s securities between March 30, 2016 and February 23, 2018, inclusive (the “Class Period”). This action is pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.\nWhat You May Do\nIf you purchased securities of Ulta and would like to discuss your legal rights and how this case might affect you and your right to recover for your economic loss, you may, without obligation or cost to you, contact KSF Managing Partner Lewis Kahn toll-free at 1-877-515-1850 or via email ( lewis.kahn@ksfcounsel.com ), or visit https://www.ksfcounsel.com/cases/nasdaqgs-ulta/ to learn more.
