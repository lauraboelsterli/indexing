    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO and IRVINE, Calif., Sellpoints, Inc ., a ConversionPoint Technologies company dedicated to helping brands and retailers sell more online, has promoted its chief revenue officer, Jon Gregg, to the position of president.\nGregg succeeds Brian O’Keefe, who has stepped down to pursue other interests but will continue to serve on ConversionPoint’s advisory board. The move follows ConversionPoint’s acquisition of Sellpoints last December.\nAs president, Gregg will be responsible for leading the company’s growth strategy as a fast-growing global provider of e-Commerce marketing technology.\n“Jon was the ideal candidate for this position, given his extensive operational and sales experience, stellar performance as Sellpoints’ CRO, and clear vision for growing the company and enhancing the technologies we deliver to our clients,” said Robert Tallack, CEO of ConversionPoint Technologies. “Jon will continue to build upon Sellpoint’s foundation of amazing e-Commerce capabilities, marquee clients and industry partnerships, which has set the stage for growth and market expansion in 2018 and beyond.”\nFollowing his foundational career experiences at Ogilvy & Mather and Wunderman Cato Johnson, Gregg went on to develop and lead sales and operational strategies which have generated more than $260 million in revenue for both startups and established global enterprises. He became a top sales producer at Yahoo!, where during his seven-year tenure he developed enterprise licensing partnerships that included a co-branded ISP service for Costco and K-Mart.\nHe has also activated foundational content licenses for Autonomy's consumer video platform, Blinkx, and launched consumer revenue operations for Bezos Expeditions-backed SkyGrid. He has served as vice president of west coast sales for NewsCorp’s FOX Audience Network, and as chief revenue officer of ShareThis where he was responsible for sales, account management, ad operations and business intelligence.\n“I’m honored to lead our talented Sellpoints team and further our mission of helping brands sell more online,” commented Gregg. “Our focus on developing world-class technology has driven the evolution of our OMNI and ReTargeter platforms. Combined with our deep expertise and industry relationships in eCommerce, we’re uniquely positioned to enable eCommerce brands to more effectively engage their audiences. As we continue this commitment to our global retailer partners and more than 500 global consumer brands, we see robust opportunities to deliver even greater differentiated value to our customers.”\nOriginally from New York, Gregg now lives in the Bay Area with his wife and three children.\nAbout Sellpoints\nSellpoints, a ConversionPoint Technologies company, is an e-Commerce technology provider dedicated to helping brands and retailers sell more online.
