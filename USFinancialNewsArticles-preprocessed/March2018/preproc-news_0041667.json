AUM, Flows and Investment Performance\nVictory Capital's AUM increased $2.8 billion, or 5%, to $61.8 billion at December 31, 2017, compared to $59.0 billion at September 30, 2017. The increase was primarily due to $2.6 billion in net market appreciation and net inflows of $0.3 billion. Gross flows for the fourth quarter were $4.4 billion. For the year ended December 31, 2017, AUM increased $6.8 billion, or 12%, to $61.8 billion from $55.0 billion at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to $8.4 billion in net market appreciation, partially offset by $1.5 billion of net outflows (or $0.9 billion excluding the Diversified Equity Franchise). Gross flows for the year were $16.9 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Victory Capital offered 65 investment strategies through its nine autonomous Investment Franchises and Solutions Platform. The table below presents outperformance against benchmarks by AUM and strategies as of December 31, 2017.\nTrailing 1-Year Trailing 3-Years Trailing 5-Years Trailing 10-Years Percentage of AUM Outperforming Benchmark 88% 84% 84% 80% Percentage of Strategies Outperforming Benchmark 74% 72% 77% 75% Fourth Quarter of 2017 Compared to Third Quarter of 2017\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, net income increased 43% to $11.2 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to net income of $7.9 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2017.

Adjusted Net Income with tax benefit increased 5% to $23.1 million, or $0.39 per diluted share comprised of $0.30 per diluted share in Adjusted Net Income and $0.09 per diluted share in tax benefit, compared to $22.0 million, or $0.37 per diluted share comprised of $0.29 per diluted share in Adjusted Net Income and $0.08 per diluted share in tax benefit, for the third quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin were $40.0 million and 37.9%, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $39.3 million and 38.3%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2017. The increases in net income, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA resulted from higher revenue coupled with scale effects in the business. The increases in net income and Adjusted Net Income also reflected lower interest expense, primarily due to refinancing activity in August 2017.\nRevenue increased 3% to $105.6 million, compared to $102.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 due to higher average AUM, partially offset by a decrease in the realized fee rate due to asset mix. Operating expenses were $78.7 million, compared to $78.2 million in the third quarter of 2017.\nFourth Quarter of 2017 Compared to Fourth Quarter of 2016\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2017, net income was $11.2 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $2.7 million, or $0.05 per basic and diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. GAAP operating margin was 25.5% for the quarter compared to 6.7% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted Net Income with tax benefit increased 36% to $23.1 million, or $0.39 per diluted share comprised of $0.30 per diluted share in Adjusted Net Income and $0.09 per diluted share in tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $17.0 million, or $0.31 per diluted share comprised of $0.23 per diluted share in Adjusted Net Income and $0.08 per diluted share in tax benefit, in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin were $40.0 million and 37.9%, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $32.1 million and 32.7%, respectively, for the fourth quarter a year ago. Net income, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA increased due to higher revenue coupled with scale effects, the successful integration of RS Investments and, specific to net income and Adjusted Net Income, a decrease in interest expense primarily due to refinancing activity in August 2017.\nRevenue increased 8% to $105.6 million, compared to $98.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, due to higher average AUM, partially offset by a decrease in the realized fee rate due to asset mix. Operating expenses decreased 14% to $78.7 million, compared to $91.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to scale effects and the successful integration of RS Investments.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income was $25.8 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $6.1 million, or $0.12 per basic and diluted share, for 2016. GAAP operating margin was 22.0% in 2017 compared to 8.2% in 2016. Adjusted Net Income with tax benefit increased 46% to $81.7 million, or $1.37 per diluted share comprised of $1.04 per diluted share in Adjusted Net Income and $0.33 per diluted share in tax benefit in 2017, compared to $55.8 million, or $1.12 per diluted share comprised of $0.78 per diluted share in Adjusted Net Income and $0.34 per diluted share in tax benefit, in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin were $149.1 million and 36.4%, respectively, in 2017, compared to $98.1 million and 32.9%, respectively, in 2016.\nRevenue for the year increased 38% to $409.6 million, compared to $297.9 million in 2016 as a result of higher AUM primarily due to the acquisition of RS Investments in July 2016. Operating expenses increased 17% to $319.4 million, compared to $273.4 million in 2016, primarily due to the acquisition of RS Investments in July 2016.\nBalance Sheet / Capital Management\nCash and cash equivalents were $12.9 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $16.4 million at December 31, 2016. The Company paid down $18.0 million of debt during the fourth quarter, resulting in aggregate debt outstanding of $499.7 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $517.7 million at September 30, 2017. The repayment of debt resulted in annualized interest expense savings of $1.2 million.\nSubsequent to year-end, the Company issued 11.7 million shares of Class A common stock in an initial public offering, or IPO, for an aggregate of $143.0 million in net proceeds. The Company used the net proceeds from its IPO, together with cash on hand, to pay down debt and entered into a new $360.0 million syndicated senior credit facility. In March 2018, the Company issued an additional 1.1 million shares of Class A common stock pursuant to an underwriters' option to purchase additional shares in the IPO for $13.5 million in net proceeds. Victory Capital used the net proceeds from the option exercise, as well as cash on hand, to repay $37.0 million of the outstanding term loan, resulting in annualized interest expense savings of approximately $1.6 million. As of March 26, 2018, aggregate debt outstanding is $323.0 million.\nImpact of Tax Reform\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\") was enacted. The Tax Act significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax law by, among other things, decreasing the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the Company is required to remeasure its U.S. net deferred taxes at December 31, 2017. The impact of the remeasurement is a one-time credit to income tax expense of $2.4 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017.\nEffective January 1, 2018, Victory Capital estimates the impact of the Tax Act will lower the Company's combined statutory federal income tax rate plus an estimate for state, local and foreign income taxes from approximately 38% to approximately 24%, thus lowering its income tax expense beginning in calendar year 2018. The reduction in the combined statutory federal income tax rate plus an estimate for state, local and foreign income taxes, from approximately 38% to approximately 24%, will reduce the tax benefit of goodwill and acquired intangible assets beginning in 2018.\nAbout Victory Capital\nVictory Capital is an independent investment management firm operating a next-generation, integrated multi-boutique business model with $61.8 billion in assets under management and advisement as of December 31, 2017.\nVictory Capital's differentiated model is comprised of nine Investment Franchises, each with an independent culture and investment approach. Additionally, the Company offers a rules-based Solutions Platform, featuring the VictoryShares ETF brand, as well as custom and multi-asset class solutions. The Company's Investment Franchises and Solutions Platform are supported by a centralized distribution, marketing and operational environment, in which the investment professionals can focus on the pursuit of investment excellence.\nVictory Capital provides institutions, financial advisors and retirement platforms with a variety of asset classes and investment vehicles, including separately managed accounts, collective trusts, mutual funds, ETFs and UMA/SMA vehicles.\nFor more information, please visit www.vcm.com .\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

These measures eliminate the impact of one‑time acquisition, restructuring and integration costs and demonstrate the ongoing operating earnings metrics of the business. The Company has included these non‑GAAP measures to provide investors with the same financial metrics used by management to assess the operating performance of the Company.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjustments made to GAAP net income to calculate Adjusted EBITDA are:\nAdding back interest paid on debt net of interest income;\nAdding back depreciation on property and equipment;\nAdding back other business taxes;\nAdding back GAAP amortization of acquisition‑related intangibles;\nAdding back the expense associated with stock‑based compensation associated with equity issued from pools that were created in connection with the management‑led buyout with Crestview GP from KeyCorp, the Munder Acquisition and the RS Acquisition and as a result of any equity grants related to the IPO;\nAdding back direct incremental costs of acquisitions and the IPO, including expenses associated with third‑party advisors, proxy solicitations of mutual fund shareholders for transaction consents, vendor contract early termination costs, impairment of receivables recorded in connection with an acquisition and severance, retention and transaction incentive compensation;\nAdding back debt issuance costs;\nAdding back pre‑IPO governance expenses paid to the Company's private equity partners that terminated as of the completion of the IPO;\nAdjusting for earnings/losses on equity method investments; and\nAdding back annual incentive compensation paid in excess of expected levels due to acquisitions.\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjustments made to GAAP net income to calculate Adjusted Net Income are:\nAdding back other business taxes;\nAdding back GAAP amortization of acquisition‑related intangibles;\nAdding back the expense associated with stock‑based compensation associated with equity issued from pools that were created in connection with the management‑led buyout with Crestview GP from KeyCorp, the Munder Acquisition and the RS Acquisition and as a result of any equity grants related to the IPO;\nAdding back direct incremental costs of acquisitions and the IPO, including expenses associated with third‑party advisors, proxy solicitations of mutual fund shareholders for transaction consents, vendor contract early termination costs, impairment of receivables recorded in connection with an acquisition and severance, retention and transaction incentive compensation;\nAdding back debt issuance costs;\nAdding back pre‑IPO governance expenses paid to the Company's private equity partners that terminated as of the completion of the IPO;\nAdding back annual incentive compensation paid in excess of expected levels due to acquisitions;\nSubtracting an estimate of income tax expense on the adjustments; and\nSubtracting the impact of remeasuring the U.S. net deferred taxes under the Tax Act.\nTax Benefit of Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles\nDue to Victory Capital's acquisitive nature, tax deductions allowed on acquired intangible assets and goodwill provide it with additional significant supplemental economic benefit. The tax benefit of goodwill and intangibles represents the tax benefits associated with deductions allowed for intangibles and goodwill generated from prior acquisitions in which the Company received a step‑up in basis for tax purposes. Acquired intangible assets and goodwill may be amortized for tax purposes, generally over a 15‑year period. The tax benefit from amortization on these assets is included to show the full economic benefit of deductions for all acquired intangibles with a step‑up in tax basis.\nSource:Victory Capital Holdings, Inc.",
