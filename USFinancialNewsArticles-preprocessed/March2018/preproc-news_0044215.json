    "text": "For the 2nd year in a row, Fleet Complete is recognized by Mediacorp as one of the most prospective employers in the Greater Toronto area and continues to draw in the most experienced and highly sought-after executive suite in the industry.\nTORONTO, March 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - For the second consecutive year, Fleet Complete, the fastest-growing global provider of IoT solutions in the connected vehicle space, has received the prestigious Greater Toronto's Top Employers 2018 award for its innovative practices in workplace and HR. Fleet Complete's comprehensive review of operations and HR practices was measured up against big corporations and Canadian affiliates, such as Accenture, BASF, General Motors, KPMG, Manulife, Royal Bank of Canada, Samsung, and Siemens.\n\"The GTA has always attracted the best and brightest from across the country,\" says Richard Yerema, Managing Editor of Canada's Top 100 Employers project. \"Other parts of Canada have long watched with dismay at the numbers of educated and talented young people moving to Toronto. But today, the GTA is a beacon for talented people from around the world – and employers in this region now lead the nation when it comes to offering progressive HR policies and initiatives that reflect such a varied and diverse population.\"\nOn the heels of this impressive achievement, the company has also been attracting outstanding leadership talent to its core. Due to the company's accelerated growth initiatives, partnerships and acquisitions, Fleet Complete now boasts one of the most experienced leadership teams in the industry, welcoming Alex Armanious as the new Chief Operating Officer and Robyn Scott as Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Seasoned experts within the international telecom circles, Scott and Armanious – both hailing from Toronto – will help propel the company's success in its rapid business expansion and ensure long-term profitability.\nAs Fleet Complete's COO, Alex Armanious will drive the progressive evolution of global operations and services. He is set to ensure the harmonious alignment between the company's continuous international growth and tailored customer experience across all regions. Armanious was most recently Senior Vice President Product & Technology at Mosaic and Chief Information Officer at LafargeHolcim before that, driving new business process models and transforming operations that saw $300MM in cost reduction. Armanious will bring a combination of extensive IT experience, efficiency improvement and global go-to-market expertise to his work in ensuring Fleet Complete's customer success initiatives.\nRobyn Scott, the new EVP General Counsel, joins Fleet Complete as a critical member of the executive team in meeting the company's strategic business goals for the future. With a diverse legal expertise in the technology and venture capital sectors, she oversees all legal and regulatory governance, steering Fleet Complete's international success in compliance with guidelines and protocols. Over the past 11 years, Scott has worked at established public companies, such as Rogers Communications, World Gaming, Moneris Solutions and Sigma Systems, where she most recently served as General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. She also consulted for companies in India, Brazil, China, Europe, and Hong Kong during her EMBA in Switzerland.\n\"We are thrilled to have Robyn and Alex join our executive ranks, and excited that such high caliber professionals chose Fleet Complete as their next step in career development,\" comments Larry Indovina, EVP Human Resources at Fleet Complete. \"Toronto anchors the highest concentration of innovative and progressive employers that compete for top-rated talent, and the fact that we have been recognized yet again as one of the Greater Toronto's Top Employers means we are moving in the right direction.\"\nAbout Mediacorp\nFounded in 1992, Mediacorp Canada Inc. is the nation's largest publisher of employment periodicals.
