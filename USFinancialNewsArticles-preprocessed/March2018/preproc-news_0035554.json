    "text": "BOSTON, March 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Public Consulting Group, Inc. (PCG) announced today that its public sector research and IT solutions practice is growing with the acquisition of Hornby Zeller Associates, Inc.

Its work encompasses the fields of child welfare, public health, mental health, substance abuse, courts, adult and juvenile corrections, and early childhood and family support.\n\"With this acquisition, PCG is branching out into a new space while improving the quality of service we are currently able to provide our public sector clients,\" said Bill Mosakowski, president and CEO of PCG. \"We are thrilled to bring on the team from HZA, and are confident that through their efforts we can help our partners in the public sector provide better and more efficient services to their constituents.\"\nHZA's rigorous analysis assists its clients in making decisions about how best to allocate staff and financial resources; its evaluations help clients understand what programs are working and with what populations. HZA's cross-disciplinary team, which includes those with advanced degrees in social work, public administration, public health, education, and sociology, with others trained in computer technology and applied mathematics, derives meaning from the wealth of data that is collected by public agencies.\n\"We couldn't be happier to be joining the PGC family,\" said Helaine Hornby, Principal of HZA. \"We are already in more than 35 states and look forward to assisting even more of the most vulnerable members of our society.
