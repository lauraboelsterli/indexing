REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci/File Photo Norwegian Air is trying to crack the transatlantic market by undercutting established rivals but faces pressures to control costs and shore up its balance sheet in the face of stiff competition. “Additional capital will boost competitiveness and protect existing and future investments in a market characterised by higher oil prices and fluctuating currencies,” it said in a statement. FILE PHOTO: Bjorn Kjos, CEO of Norwegian Group, speaks during the presentation of Norwegian Air first low cost transatlantic flight service from Argentina at Ezeiza airport in Buenos Aires, Argentina, March 8, 2018. REUTERS/Marcos Brindicci/File Photo “The company is now positioning itself for the final stages of a strong growth period that has lasted for several years and will reach its peak by the second quarter of 2018.” The airline said the planned share issue had the backing of biggest shareholder HBK Holding, which controls 26.4 percent of the company’s capital, and “significant support” from its existing shareholder base. Norwegian Air said it would post a first-quarter pretax loss of 2.6 billion crowns, widening from a 1.8 billion crown loss in the same period last year. The company is due to report quarterly results on April 26. Reporting by Gwladys Fouche and Camilla Knudsen; Editing by David Goodman",
