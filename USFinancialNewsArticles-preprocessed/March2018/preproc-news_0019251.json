    "text": "Damian Lillard scored 19 of his 39 points in the fourth quarter as the Portland Trail Blazers came from behind to defeat the Los Angeles Lakers 108-103 Monday night at Staples Center in Los Angeles.\nLillard knocked down four straight 3-point shots, as the Trail Blazers rallied from an 11-point deficit in the final 5:26 to win their seventh game in a row.\nCJ McCollum added 22 points and Jusuf Nurkic collected 16 points and 16 rebounds, as Portland beat the Lakers for the 15th consecutive time dating to March 2014.\nJulius Randle had 21 points and nine rebounds and Isaiah Thomas chipped in 19 points despite a 5-for-21 shooting performance for the Lakers, who saw the end to a five-game win streak.\nLillard scored 14 points in the second quarter as Portland weathered a Laker rally to take a 58-55 lead into the half. Lillard had 17 and McCollum 13 before the break.\nThe Lakers scored the first seven points of the third quarter to seize a 62-58 advantage. The Blazers made only one of their first 10 shots from the field in the quarter, as the Lakers stoked the margin to 74-62. They settled for an 80-73 lead heading into the final period.\nThe Blazers trimmed it to 84-80, but the Lakers pushed it to 97-86 with 5:30 remaining. Portland rallied with an 14-0 run, Lillard finishing it on three consecutive 3-pointers for a 100-97 lead with 3:10 to go.\nKyle Kuzma’s layup cut it to 100-99, but Lillard drilled another 3 to make it 103-99 with 2:21 to play. Kuzma split a pair of foul shots, then Lonzo Ball knocked down a trey to tie it at 103-103 with 1:57 on the clock. Lillard made 1 of 2 at the line to put Portland back ahead 104-103 with 1:24 left.\nNurkic sank two free throws to give the Blazers a 106-103 lead with 1:16 to go. Neither team scored again until Shabazz Napier made two foul shots with one second left.\nPortland took an 11-6 lead, as the Lakers started the game 3-for-14 from the field. The Blazers extended the advantage to 24-13 behind nine early points from McCollum. The Lakers closed the quarter on an 11-3 run to get within 27-24 after one quarter.\nThe Blazers jacked the difference up to 46-32 midway through the second quarter. The Lakers used an 8-0 run to close the gap to 46-40, then cut it to 52-51. Portland took a three-point edge into intermission.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
