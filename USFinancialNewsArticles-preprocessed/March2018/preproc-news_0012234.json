    "text": "Andy Cross/The Denver Post via Getty Images Truck driver Mike Segelke tightens up chains on his semi-truck at a chain-up station. \nAccording to Adzuna and the BLS, driving is the deadliest job in the United States, with 918 fatalities in 2016. \nThe job with the highest fatal injury rate, however, was logging. There are 135.9 fatal work injuries per 100,000 workers in the logging industry â€” an significant figure given that the fatal injury rate among all workers is just 3.6. \nWhile the workplace has steadily become safer over the past century, the number of workplace fatalities actually increased by 7 percent in the private sector and 9 percent among government workers in 2016. During the year of the study, there were 5,190 workplace fatalities. \n\"The premium for working in hazardous conditions is often low, or non-existent in the case of fishing workers, refuse collectors and those doing logging jobs. This begs the question of whether the risk is worth the reward,\" says Doug Monro, co-founder of Adzuna, noting that \"5,190 fatalities in 2016, is 5,190 fatalities too many. We need to invest more into making sure every job is safe.\" \nLike this story? Like CNBC Make It on Facebook \nDon't miss: ",
