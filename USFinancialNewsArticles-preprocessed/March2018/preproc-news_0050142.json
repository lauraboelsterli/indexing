    "text": "* Hang Seng index ends up 0.2 pct\n* China Enterprises index HSCE flat\n* HSI financial sector sub-index is flat; property sector up 0.2 percent\nMarch 29 (Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks ended higher amid perceived progress on North Korea issues, though caution lingered as investors continued to watch the development of China-U.S. trade spat. ** At close of trade, the Hang Seng index closed 0.2 percent up at 30,093.38, while the Hang Seng China Enterprises index was flat at 1198.34. ** North and South Korea will hold their first summit in more than a decade on April 27, South Korean officials said on Thursday, after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un pledged his commitment to denuclearisation as tensions ease between the old foes. ** Japan has sounded out the North Korean government about a bilateral summit, and Pyongyang has discussed the possibility of a leaders’ meeting with Japan and other countries, Japan’s Asahi newspaper said on Thursday. ** However, caution lingered as investors kept an eye on developments regarding the ongoing Sino-U.S. trade spat. ** Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods may not be imposed until early June, administration officials said on Wednesday, with public consultations and potential tariff revisions buying time for negotiations to forestall them. ** China warned the United States on Thursday not to open a Pandora’s Box and spark a flurry of protectionist practices across the globe, even as Beijing pointed to U.S. goods that it could target in a deepening Sino-U.S. trade dispute. ** The top gainer on Hang Seng was China Mengniu Dairy Co Ltd , which closed 7.75 percent higher, while the biggest loser was PetroChina Co Ltd, which ended down 1.82 percent. ** As of previous session, the Hang Seng index was up 0.35 percent this year, while China’s H-share index climbed 2.5 percent. As of previous close, Hang Seng declined 2.67 percent this month. ** The top gainers among H-shares were Air China Ltd up 5.37 percent, followed by Shenzhou International Group Holdings Ltd, which gained 4.89 percent and Anhui Conch Cement Co Ltd, which rose 4.64 percent. ** The three biggest H-shares percentage decliners were Byd Co Ltd, which was down 2.69 percent, ZhongAn Online P&C Insurance Co Ltd, which dropped 2.6 percent and Dongfeng Motor Group Co Ltd, which ended 2.5 percent down. ** At close, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 27.06 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares. ** The price-to-earnings ratio of the Hang Seng index was 12.27 as of the last full trading day while the dividend yield was 3.2 percent.
