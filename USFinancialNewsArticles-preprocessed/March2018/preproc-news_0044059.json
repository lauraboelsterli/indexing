In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company posted an out-of-period adjustment to record RMB15.5 million of omitted revenues that should have been recognized in prior periods, of which RMB4.5 million, RMB6.8 million, RMB3.0 million, and RMB1.2 million are attributed to the third, the second and the first quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. If excluding this out-of-period adjustment, net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 would have been RMB245.1 million, representing an 89.4% increase from the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross billings were RMB393.4 million (US$60.5 million), a 37.8% increase from RMB285.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross margin was 62.4%, compared with 64.6% for the fourth quarter of 2016. If recording the revenue out-of-period adjustment in respective periods, gross margin for the fourth, the third, the second and the first quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016 would have been 60.0%, 62.5%, 64.2%, 66.3% and 64.9%, respectively. Percentage of gross billings contributed by K-12 students was 80.3%, compared with 64.4% for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFiscal Year 201 7 Financial and Operational Highlights\nNet revenues were RMB848.0 million (US$130.3 million), a 102.7% increase from RMB418.3 million for the fiscal year 2016. Gross billings were RMB1,426.9 million (US$219.3 million), a 64.3% increase from RMB868.7 million for the fiscal year 2016. Gross margin was 63.0%, compared with 64.8% for the fiscal year 2016. Percentage of gross billings contributed by K-12 students was 74.6%, compared with 55.4% for the fiscal year 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities reached RMB55.1 million (US$8.5 million), compared with RMB28.7 million of net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year 2016.\nKey Operating Data\nFor the three\nmonths ended\nFor the year ended\nDec. 31,\nDec. 31,\nY-o-Y\nDec. 31,\nDec. 31,\nY-o-Y\n2016\n2017\nChange\n2016\n2017\nChange\nGross billings\n(in RMB millions)\n285.5\n393.4\n37.8%\n868.7\n1,426.9\n64.3%\nGross billings contributed\nby K-12 students\n(in RMB millions)\n183.8\n316.0\n71.9%\n480.9\n1,064.4\n121.3%\nActive students 2\n(in thousands)\n115.5\n175.2\n51.7%\n163.2\n249.7\n53.0%\n[1] Gross billings for a specific period, which is one of the Company's key operating data, is defined as the total amount of cash received for the sale of course packages and services in such period, net of the total amount of refunds in such period.\n[2] An \"active student\" for a specified period refers to a student who booked at least one paid lesson, and excludes those students who only attended paid live broadcasting lessons or trial lessons.\n\"We are pleased to report another strong quarter that capped off a solid year,\" said Mr. Jack Jiajia Huang, Founder, Director and Chief Executive Officer of 51Talk. \"This quarter was highlighted by continued strong results from our K-12 mass-market one-on-one offering and encouraging early results of our recently launched K-12 small class offering. As a result, the gross billings contributed by K-12 students reached over 80% for the quarter. Key operating metrics for the small class offering were in line with, or better than, our expectation, and we are very excited about the growth prospects of this new program.\n\"We made significant strides in 2017 to position our Company for continued growth,\" Mr. Huang added. \"In the third quarter of 2017 we announced our strategic focus on the K-12 segment including both our mass-market one-on-one format and our small class offering. This K-12 focus provides a more favorable margin proposition in the future and significantly widens our target customer opportunity, allowing us to further penetrate the market down to second-, third- and fourth-tier cities in China.\n\"In conjunction with our K-12 focus, we unveiled our new brand positioning a few weeks ago. Our 51Talk brand now represents K-12 mass-market one-on-one products and will be the centerpiece of our marketing campaign this spring. We will position our small class offering under the Hawo brand and our adult English offering under the WuYouYingYu brand. We believe our refined strategic focus and more fully developed brand identity will increase national awareness of our offerings and position us well for continued growth,\" Mr. Huang concluded.\nMr. Jimmy Lai, Chief Financial Officer of 51Talk, added, \"We saw dynamic growth for both net revenues and gross billings for the full year 2017, which we view as indicative of our compelling model and our strong competitive position. We anticipate gross billings pressure in the first quarter of 2018, as we continue to deemphasize our lower margin American Academy offering. But importantly, our billings mix is shifting to our higher margin mass-market K-12 offerings and our pipeline is expected to yield solid results. Following anticipated weakness in the first quarter of 2018, we expect gross billings trends to resume to past growth patterns starting in the second quarter of the year, as our mass-market K-12 focus strategy takes effect and our small class offering grows. In addition, our nationwide marketing and brand awareness campaign targeting the spring back-to-school season will likely pressure sales and marketing expenses near-term, but those costs are expected to subside as those programs gain traction through the year.\n\"As we leverage our proven and industry leading technology, our refined strategy targets higher margin revenue growth and a large and diverse customer base which builds our confidence in the future,\" Mr. Lai concluded.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB260.6 million (US$40.1 million), a 103.3% increase from RMB128.2 million for the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily attributed to an increase in the number of active students and, to a lesser extent, an increase in the average revenue per active student. The number of active students in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 175.2 thousand, a 51.7% increase from 115.5 thousand for the same quarter last year.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB98.0 million (US$15.1 million), a 115.8% increase from RMB45.4 million for the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in total service fees paid to teachers, due to the delivery of an increased number of paid lessons as well as the increased cost per lesson associated with year-over-year increased use of western teachers.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB162.6 million (US$25.0 million), a 96.4% increase from RMB82.8 million for the same quarter last year.\nGross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 62.4%, compared with 64.6% for the same quarter last year. The decrease was mainly attributable to the year-over-year increased penetration of the American Academy program, which has a lower gross profit margin.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB315.5 million (US$48.5 million), a 35.2% increase from RMB233.4 million for the same quarter last year. The increase was mainly the result of increases in sales and marketing, product development, and general and administrative expenses.\nSales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB190.2 million (US$29.2 million), a 37.3% increase from RMB138.6 million for the same quarter last year. The increase was mainly due to higher expenses related to an increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel, as well as increased marketing and branding promotional expenses. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB189.0 million (US$29.0 million), a 37.3% increase from RMB137.6 million for the same quarter last year.\nProduct development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB60.4 million (US$9.3 million), a 31.1% increase from RMB46.1 million for the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily the result of newly added technology and course development-related personnel to further strengthen technology platforms and expand curriculum offerings, as well as higher technical services fees, partially offset by lower recognized share-based compensation expenses. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP product development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB58.1 million (US$8.9 million), a 37.3% increase from RMB42.3 million for the same quarter last year.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB64.9 million (US$10.0 million), a 33.1% increase from RMB48.8 million for the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily due to additional expenses for personnel necessary to support expanded operations, as well as higher recruitment costs and costs related to compliance and reporting obligations as a public company. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP general and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB61.0 million (US$9.4 million), a 37.5% increase from RMB44.3 million for the same quarter last year.\nLoss from Operations\nLoss from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB152.9 million (US$23.5 million), compared with RMB150.6 million for the same quarter last year.\nNon-GAAP loss from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB145.5 million (US$22.4 million), compared with RMB141.5 million for the same quarter last year.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB159.7 million (US$24.5 million), compared with RMB154.2 million for the same quarter last year.\nNon-GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB152.2 million (US$23.4 million), compared with RMB145.0 million for the same quarter last year.\nBasic and diluted net loss per American depositary share (\"ADS\") attributable to ordinary shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB7.95 (US$1.20), compared with basic and diluted net loss per ADS attributable to ordinary shareholders of RMB7.70 for the same quarter last year. Each ADS represents 15 Class A ordinary shares.\nNon-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per ADS attributable to ordinary shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB7.50 (US$1.20), compared with non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per ADS attributable to ordinary shareholders of RMB7.24 for the same quarter last year.\nBalance Sheet\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had total cash, cash equivalents, time deposits and short-term investments of RMB623.4 million (US$95.8 million), compared with RMB647.0 million as of December 31, 2016.\nThe Company had deferred revenues (current and non-current) of RMB1,201.8 million (US$184.7 million) as of December 31, 2017, compared with RMB687.1 million as of December 31, 2016.\nFiscal Yea r 201 7 Financial Results\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues for the fiscal year 2017 were RMB848.0 million (US$130.3 million), a 102.7% increase from RMB418.3 million for the last year.

The number of active students was 249.7 thousand, a 53.0% increase from 163.2 thousand for the last year.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues for the fiscal year 2017 was RMB314.1 million (US$48.3 million), a 113.5% increase from RMB147.2 million for the last year. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in total service fees paid to teachers, mainly due to the delivery of an increased number of paid lessons, as well as the increased cost per lesson associated with year-over-year increased use of western teachers.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit for the fiscal year 2017 was RMB533.9 million (US$82.1 million), a 96.9% increase from RMB271.1 million for the last year.\nGross margin for the fiscal year 2017 was 63.0%, compared with 64.8% for the last year.

The increase was mainly due to an increase in the number of sales and marketing personnel, as well as increased marketing and promotional expenses. There were no share-based compensation expenses recognized prior to the second quarter of 2016 as the initial public offering performance condition was not considered probable until the occurrence. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP sales and marketing expenses were RMB652.5 million (US$100.3 million), a 41.9% increase from RMB459.8 million for the last year.\nProduct development expenses for the fiscal year 2017 were RMB223.2 million (US$34.3 million), a 46.2% increase from RMB152.7 million for the last year. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in the number of technology and course development-related personnel to further strengthen technology platforms and expand curriculum offerings, as well as higher technical services fees, partially offset by lower recognized share-based compensation expenses and by a reversal of share-based compensation expenses recognized related to unvested options upon departure of some technology-related personnel. There were no share-based compensation expenses recognized prior to the second quarter of 2016 as the initial public offering performance condition was not considered probable until the occurrence. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, non-GAAP product development expenses were RMB214.2 million (US$32.9 million), a 56.9% increase from RMB136.5 million for the last year.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the fiscal year 2017 were RMB224.4 million (US$34.5 million), a 35.5% increase from RMB165.7 million for the last year.

To present each of these non-GAAP measures, the Company excludes share-based compensation expenses. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \"Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures\" set forth at the end of this press release.\n51Talk believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance by excluding share-based expenses that may not be indicative of its operating performance from a cash perspective. 51Talk believes that both management and investors benefit from these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to 51Talk's historical performance. 51Talk computes its non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter and from period to period. 51Talk believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. A limitation of using non-GAAP measures is that these non-GAAP measures exclude share-based compensation expenses that have been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in the 51Talk's business. Management compensates for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying table at the end of this press release provides more details on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures.\nExchange Rate Information\nThis announcement contains translations of certain RMB amounts into U.S. dollars at a specified rate solely for the convenience of the reader.
