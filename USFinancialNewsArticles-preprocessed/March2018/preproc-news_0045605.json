FILE PHOTO - Spain's Rafael Nadal throws his wristband to the public after winning against Ukraine at the end of their Davis Cup World Group playoff tennis tie in Madrid September 14, 2013. REUTERS/Sergio Perez The 31-year-old has not played in the competition since helping five-time winners Spain return to the top tier of world tennis with victory in India in 2016. Nadal was named in captain Sergi Bruguera’s team alongside Pablo Carreno Busta, Roberto Bautista Agut, David Ferrer and Feliciano Lopez. Nadal, 16-times grand slam champion, withdrew from the Australian Open in January after reaching the last eight due to an upper quad problem. He had been expected to return at the Mexican Open at the end of February, but missed his fifth tournament in a row. The Davis Cup quarter-finals take place over the weekend of April 6-8.
