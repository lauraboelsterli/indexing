The increase in net revenues was primarily due to increased revenues from both system integration and system development services in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCost of revenues decreased by 37.4% to US$0.4 million from US$0.6 million in the prior year period. The decline in cost of revenues was primarily due to a decrease in cost of revenues from products in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nGross profit in the fourth quarter of 2017 was US$2.7 million, as compared with US$0.2 million in the prior year period. Gross margin, which is equal to gross profit divided by net revenues, was 87.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 24.4% in the prior year period. The increase in gross margin was mainly due to increased revenue contributions from system integration and system development services during the fourth quarter of 2017, which have a relative higher gross margin than the Company's product sales.\nOperating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 16.3% to US$3.4 million from US$2.9 million in the prior year period.\nResearch and development expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased by 38.5% to US$1.0 million from US$1.6 million in the prior year period.

General and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 67.6% to US$0.8 million from US$0.5 million in the prior year period.

The decrease was primarily due to a gain from the sale of Beijing Super TV in the prior year period.\nNon-GAAP net loss [2] attributable to China Digital TV Holding Co., Ltd in the fourth quarter of 2017 was US$0.7 million, as compared to net income of US$46.9 million in the prior year period [3] .\nBalance Sheet\nAs of December 31, 2017, China Digital TV had cash and cash equivalents and term deposits totaling US$26.8 million.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nChina Digital TV's net revenues increased by 45.7% to US$6.2 million from US$4.2 million in the prior year.

The Company believes that the Non-GAAP net income provides meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's performance by excluding certain non-cash expenses that may not be indicative of its operating performance from a cash flow perspective. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from referring to this additional information in assessing the Company's performance and when planning and forecasting future periods.\nHowever, the use of non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations as an analytical tool. One of the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not include all items that impact the Company's net (loss)/ income for the period. In addition, because non-GAAP financial measures are not measured in the same manner by all companies, they may not be comparable to other similar titled measures used by other companies. In light of the foregoing limitations, you should not consider non-GAAP financial measure in isolation from or as an alternative to the financial measure prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nFor the three months ended\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2017\n2016\n(in U.S. dollars, in thousands)\nNet (loss)/income attributable to China\nDigital TV Holding Co., Ltd\nshareholders - GAAP\n$\n(740)\n$\n(1,608)\n$\n46,336\nShare-based compensation expenses\n80\n84\n590\nAmortization of intangible assets from\nbusiness acquisitions\n5\n5\n11\nNet (loss)/income attributable to China\nDigital TV Holding Co., Ltd\nshareholders - Non-GAAP\n$\n(655)\n$\n(1,519)\n$\n46,937\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-digital-tv-announces-unaudited-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-300620092.html\nSOURCE China Digital TV Holding Co., Ltd.",
