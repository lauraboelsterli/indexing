    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States made “zero concessions” and “consistently increased the pressure” on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Friday, one day after U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to meet with Kim.\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence speaks at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at National Harbor, Maryland, U.S., February 22, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo North Korea’s invitation for talks “is evidence that President Trump’s strategy to isolate the Kim regime is working,” Pence said in a statement released by the White House.\nReporting by Susan Heavey and David Brunnstrom; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ",
