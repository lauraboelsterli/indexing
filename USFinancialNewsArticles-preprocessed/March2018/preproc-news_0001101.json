    "text": "DALLAS, Feb. 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Builders FirstSource, Inc. (NasdaqGS:BLDR) today reported its results for the fourth quarter and Fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nCommenting on fourth quarter results, CEO Chad Crow remarked, “I am pleased to report we had a strong finish to the year, growing sales per day, excluding closed locations, by 13.2 percent in the fourth quarter. We saw an increase in sales volume in the single family construction end market of 7.5 percent, and 5.2 percent in the repair and remodeling / other end market. Additionally, we saw growth in manufactured products of 11.3 percent.\"\n“We are leveraging our platform strengths to deliver sales growth and strong financial results while executing on our strategic priorities and investing in our future. We continued our investments in manufacturing capacity and talent to drive enhanced growth in margin-accretive products and markets, while making further progress in paying down debt and reducing our leverage ratio on a year over year basis.”\nPeter Jackson, CFO, added, “In the quarter, we further refined our capital structure by redeeming our most expensive debt, the 10.75% unsecured notes, reducing go forward interest expense by $35 million annually. I am very pleased with the progress we are making on de-leveraging, as we reduced our leverage ratio by 0.6 times year over year to 4.2 times. Cash flow generation and debt reduction will continue to be a priority for 2018, as we execute on our multi-year plan to de-lever the balance sheet and fund growth initiatives.”\nThe Company has provided supplemental non-GAAP financial information of the consolidated company that is adjusted to exclude one-time integration, facility closure, one-time refinancing, non-cash release of tax valuation allowance and revaluation of deferred taxes, and other costs (“Adjusted”). As the information below includes non-GAAP financial information, please refer to the accompanying financial schedules for non-GAAP reconciliations to their GAAP equivalents.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2016:\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $1.8 billion, a sales increase of 15.0 percent over net sales for the fourth quarter of 2016. Sales per day, excluding closed locations, grew 13.2 percent in the quarter, which was benefited approximately 7.6 percent from the impact of commodity lumber price inflation on our sales and 5.6 percent from sales volume growth. Sales volume per day, excluding commodity inflation and closed locations, grew approximately 7.5 percent in the single family homebuilding end market and 5.2 percent in the repair and remodeling/other end market, offset by expected declines in multi-family.\nGross Margin\nGross margin of $431.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by $39.6 million over the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross margin percentage was 24.2 percent, a decrease of 110 basis points from 25.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2016. The gross margin percentage decreased primarily due to the impact of commodity price inflation relative to our short-term customer pricing commitments. Although rapid commodity inflation can cause short term gross margin percentage compression as prices are rising, higher commodity prices generally benefit the Company’s gross profit and EBITDA dollars in the long term.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $366.4 million, or 20.6 percent of sales, a decrease of 140 basis points versus the fourth quarter of 2016. The improvement in SG&A as a percent of sales was driven by cost leverage and continued cost management partially offset by investments the Company made towards growth initiatives, including additional sales associates and new locations.\nInterest Expense\nGAAP interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $89.5 million compared to $44.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 included $56.3 million related to the one time premium paid to redeem the Company’s 10.75% Senior Notes due 2023, reducing go forward annual interest expense by $35 million.\nIncome Tax Expense\nGAAP income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $18.0 million compared to income tax expense of $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The year over year increase is primarily attributable to the revaluation of our deferred taxes as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, totaling $29.0 million. Adjusted income tax expense decreased by $14.2 million compared to 2016, largely attributable to the Company’s refinancing transaction in December 2017.\nNet Income\nGAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $42.7 million, or ($0.38) per diluted share, compared to a net income of $6.4 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was impacted by $56.3 million of debt refinancing cost and $29.0 million revaluation expense on the Company’s deferred taxes as a result of the 2017 Tax Act. In the fourth quarter of 2016, GAAP net income was benefited by a release of our tax valuation allowance of $3.1 million against our deferred income tax assets offset by $9.7 million in debt issuance and refinancing costs. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $46.6 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to Adjusted net income of $18.3 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The year over year increase is primarily driven by the Company’s lower adjusted tax expense and improved operating results.\nEBITDA\nFourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA grew $12.1 million, or 14.2 percent, to $96.9 million compared to $84.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The year over year improvement was largely driven by sales increases and cost leverage realized, offset by the impact of commodity inflation on gross margin and investments the Company made towards growth initiatives, including an increase in sales associates and new locations.\nFiscal 2017 Compared to Fiscal 2016:\nNet Sales\n2017 net sales were $7.0 billion, a 10.5 percent increase over 2016. Sales, excluding closed locations, grew 10.7 percent, including 6.2 percent from the impact of commodity price inflation on sales. Sales volume, excluding commodity inflation and closed locations, grew approximately 6.9 percent in the single family homebuilding end market.\nGross Margin\nGross margin of $1.7 billion increased by $130.6 million over 2016. Gross margin percentage was 24.6 percent, down 50 basis points from 25.1 percent in 2016. The decline year over year was driven by gross profit margin compression on commodity products due to inflation in the lumber and lumber sheet good markets during most of 2017.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A was $1.4 billion or 20.5 percent of sales, a decrease of 90 basis points versus 2016. The reduction was largely attributable to cost leverage and declines in depreciation and amortization on acquired ProBuild assets, offset by investments the Company made in growth initiatives, including additional sales associates and new locations.\nInterest Expense\nGAAP interest expense was $193.2 million in 2017, a decrease of $21.5 million from 2016. The reduction is largely the result of a series of transactions that have reduced overall interest expense. In addition, interest expense for 2017 and 2016 included $58.7 million and $57.0 million, respectively, in charges relating to debt financing transactions executed to take advantage of favorable capital market conditions to lower go forward interest expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nAlthough the Company did not pay federal cash taxes in 2017, income tax expense was $53.2 million compared to an income tax benefit of $122.7 million in 2016. In 2017, the Company revalued its deferred taxes as a result of the 2017 Tax Act passed in December, increasing income tax expense by $29.0 million. The Company recorded a $128.6 million benefit in its income tax expense in 2016, which was attributable to the release of the valuation allowance against its deferred income tax assets.\nNet Income\nGAAP net income was $38.8 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, compared to a net income of $144.3 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, in 2016, a decrease of $0.93 per diluted share. The decrease is primarily driven by the tax valuation allowance of $128.6 million that was released in 2016 and the 2017 Tax Act deferred tax revaluation of $29.0 million. Adjusted net income was $147.2 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net income of $94.2 million, or $0.83 per diluted share, for 2016, an increase of $0.44 per diluted share, or 56.3 percent.\nEBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA for 2017 grew $37.4 million to $419.0 million, or 6.0 percent of sales, compared to $381.6 million, or 6.0 percent of sales, in 2016, an increase of 9.8 percent. The year over year improvement was primarily attributable to sales growth and cost leverage, partially offset by the impact of commodity inflation on gross margin and investments the Company made towards growth initiatives, including an increase in sales associates and new locations.\nCapital Structure, Leverage, and Liquidity Information:\nOn December 29, 2017, the Company redeemed all of the outstanding $367.6 million aggregate principal amount of its 10.75% Senior Notes due 2023 in contemplation of the 2017 Tax Act, which limited the future deductibility of interest expense. The redemption price was equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus the Applicable Premium, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Applicable Premium totaled $48.7 million, which included interest due through August 15, 2018 and a call premium of 8.063%, plus $13.0 million of accrued but unpaid interest. The transaction was funded by the Company with a combination of $119.1 million cash generated from operations and investing as well as $310.2 million of borrowing on its revolving credit facility. A certain amount of 2018 interest was paid in 2017 with this transaction, which impacted the cash flow and leverage ratio that the Company expected to achieve as of December 31, 2017. This transaction is expected to generate $35 million in annual go forward cash interest savings. Adjusted EBITDA in 2017 was $419.0 million and net debt was $1,746.0 million as of December 31, 2017. This leverage ratio of 4.2x net debt / Adjusted EBITDA was down from 4.8x as of December 31, 2016, enabled by a net debt reduction and EBITDA growth. Additionally, the refinancing transaction in December 2017 had a short-term impact on the year end leverage ratio, increasing the ratio by to 0.2 turns to 4.2x. The Company generated net cash from operations and investing of $119.1 million in 2017, including funding $62.4 million of capital investments. Cash generated was used for debt reduction. Cash from operations was impacted by the prepayment of 2018 interest associated with redeeming our 10.75% Senior Notes due 2023, as disclosed in the Company’s 8K filed on December 14, 2017. Liquidity at December 31, 2017 was $494.3 million, which consisted of net borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility and cash on hand.\nPlease refer to the accompanying financial schedules for more information.\nOutlook\nConcluding, Chad Crow, CEO, added, “I am as excited as ever about the outlook for Builders FirstSource for the years ahead. Demand in the new residential housing market continues to show steady growth. The Company is well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities our national footprint, strong customer relationships and our end market diversity provide. We continue to invest to further leverage our advantaged product portfolio to capture growth in the coming years. We are enthusiastic about our plans to create meaningful value through the Company’s identified initiatives as well as capitalizing on a growing single family housing market.\n“As you know, Floyd Sherman stepped down as CEO as of December 29.
