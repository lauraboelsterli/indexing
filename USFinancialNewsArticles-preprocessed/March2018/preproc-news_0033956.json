U.S. President Donald Trump walks to Marine One to board to depart for travel to New Hampshire from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, U.S., March 19, 2018. REUTERS/Leah Millis During a meeting at the White House with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Trump told reporters he believed he and Putin would meet “in the not too distant future” to discuss the arms race between the two countries, as well as the situation in Ukraine, Syria, and North Korea.
