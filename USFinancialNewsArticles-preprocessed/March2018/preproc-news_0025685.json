    "text": "GDP outlook China's industrial output grew 7.2 percent, beating expectations China's industrial output grew 7.2 percent in the first two months of the year compared with the same period last year. Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted industrial output growth would dip marginally to 6.1 percent from 6.2 percent in December, pressured by tough winter pollution restrictions. Private sector fixed-asset investment rose 8.1 percent, compared with an increase of 6.0 percent in 2017. Published 18 Hours Ago Prisma Bildagentur | UIG | Getty Images Guomao District in Beijing on February 1, 2016. \nChina's industrial output grew 7.2 percent in the first two months of the year compared with the same period last year, while fixed-asset investment growth quickened to 7.9 percent, both easily beating expectations. \nAnalysts polled by Reuters had predicted industrial output growth would dip marginally to 6.1 percent from 6.2 percent in December, pressured by tough winter pollution restrictions. \nFixed asset investment had been expected to grow 7.0 percent, cooling from 7.2 percent in the whole of 2017. \nPrivate sector fixed-asset investment rose 8.1 percent, compared with an increase of 6.0 percent in 2017. Private investment accounts for about 60 percent of overall investment in China. \nRetail sales rose 9.7 percent on-year, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Wednesday, slightly missing expectations. \nAnalysts had expected sales growth to pick-up to 9.8 percent from 9.4 percent in December. \nChina combines January and February activity data in a bid to smooth out seasonal distortions caused by the timing of the long Lunar New Year holidays, which began in mid February this year but fell in January last year. \nChina is targeting retail sales growth of about 10 percent this year, but has not announced a goal for industrial output or fixed asset investment. \nPremier Li Keqiang said last week China aims to expand its economy by around 6.5 percent this year, the same level that it handily beat in 2017 thanks in part to massive government infrastructure spending and record bank lending.",
