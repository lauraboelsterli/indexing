    "text": "Published: Mar 29, 2018 12:55 p.m. ET Share \nFirstEnergy asks the Trump administration to force grid operator to take power from certain facilities Getty Images A FirstEnergy coal-fired plant in New Eagle, Penn. built in 2013 \nBy Timothy Puko \nWASHINGTON—Power company FirstEnergy Corp. is asking the Trump administration to intervene to keep struggling nuclear and coal-fired power plants running across the Midwest, escalating a fight over which fuels power the nation’s electric grid. \nThe move puts the issue in the hands of a president and energy secretary who have promised to help the region’s energy industry, especially its struggling coal mines that have closed by the dozens in recent years. Earlier this year, government energy regulators rejected a similar request from the Energy Department. \nFirst Energy FE, -0.65% delivered the new request just hours after the company announced Wednesday evening its plans to close three nuclear-power plants in Ohio and Pennsylvania by 2021 if it can’t sell them. FirstEnergy’s fleet of coal and nuclear plants has been tottering on bankruptcy, hit like many of its peers nationwide by aggressive competition from cleaner gas-fired and renewable power generators that have become cheaper to run in the past decade. \nThe request goes to President Donald Trump’s energy secretary, Rick Perry, who has said several times these plants are vital to stable prices and a reliable electric grid. Late last year, he pitched a plan to guarantee profits for these plants, which would keep them open by ensuring they wouldn’t have to compete in electricity markets. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected that plan, saying it didn’t appear necessary. The utilities say Perry can use emergency powers to enact a similar plan.",
