    "text": "JOHANNESBURG, March 29 (Reuters) - A class action lawsuit was filed on Thursday against South Africa’s Tiger Brands, one of whose food factories has been linked to a listeria outbreak that has killed 180 people since early 2017, the lawyer running the case said.\nRichard Spoor, a human rights advocate who masterminded a massive class action on behalf of gold miners with silicosis, said the case against Tiger Brands was clear. “Their fingerprints are all over this outbreak,” he told Reuters.\nA spokeswoman for Tiger Brands confirmed the company had received the filing and was reviewing its contents.
