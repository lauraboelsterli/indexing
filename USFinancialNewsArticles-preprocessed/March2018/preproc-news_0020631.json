    "text": "SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in believes a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un could lead to the North giving up its nuclear weapons programme, Moon’s spokesman said on Friday.\nKim Jong Un told South Korean National Security Office head Chung Eui-yong there would be major results from a meeting with Trump, Moon’s spokesman, Kim Eui-kyeom, told reporters at a briefing. Chung met Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang earlier this week.\nTrump quickly agreed to a summit with Kim Jong Un after Chung gave him a personal invitation in Washington, Kim Eui-kyeom said.\nReporting by Josh Smith; Editing by Paul Tait\n ",
