Gateway is one of the largest and most diversified gaming and entertainment companies in Canada. The three acquired properties include the Grand Villa Casino Burnaby, Starlight Casino New Westminster and Cascades Casino Langley.\nUnder the agreement, Mesirow Realty Sale-Leaseback, Inc. (\"MRSL\"), the net-lease real estate investment arm of Mesirow Financial, will now become the landlord for the three properties for a purchase price in excess of C$500 million. Certain of Gateway's wholly owned subsidiaries have entered into long term leases for each of the properties and will continue to operate the casinos under the leases, offering the same exceptional customer experience with no expected changes to employees or operations at these locations.\nLed by Senior Managing Directors Garry Cohen and Douglas Barker, Mesirow Financial's Sale-Leaseback Capital group arranged for the purchase of the three Gateway flagship properties.

MRSL was principally represented by its law firm, Goldberg Kohn of Chicago, as well as by its local British Columbia and Canadian counsel, Boughton Law Corporation. Four Corners Advisors and David Solano served as the buyer's advisors on the transaction.\n\"This traditional real estate transaction unlocks significant value and generates cash which the company will use to reduce debt, invest in Gateway's growth, support new developments and job creation, and deliver value to our stakeholders,\" said Gabriel de Alba, Gateway's Executive Chairman.\nMesirow Financial's Garry Cohen, stated, \"after having closed more than $1.5 Billion USD in sale-leaseback transactions in the last two years, we are excited to have closed on Mesirow Realty Sale-Leaseback's first cross-border transaction monetizing these three exceptional and strategic assets.

We continue to enhance our full-service platform in acquiring single-tenant properties, now internationally, complemented by our strong capabilities in debt placement,\" said Dominick Mondi, President of Mesirow Financial and of its Capital Markets division.\nBennett Jones LLP and Latham & Watkins LLP served as legal counsel to Gateway.
