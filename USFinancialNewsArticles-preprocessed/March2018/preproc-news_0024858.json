    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- David Blumenstein , President and CEO of The Segal Group, announced that effective today, the firm has acquired The Singer Group , a human resources and organizational development consulting firm based in the Baltimore area.\nThe Singer Group provides compensation, organizational design, performance management and other human resources-related consulting services. They have deep experience working with public and private sector employers, and have developed a special expertise working with library systems. With this acquisition, The Singer Group is now part of Segal Waters Consulting , The Segal Group’s public sector human resources consulting practice.\n“The Singer Group’s growing focus on service in the public sector and to library systems during the last decade and a half have set it apart as a go-to firm among these employers,” said Mr. Blumenstein. “We are pleased to welcome their additional perspectives and expertise to Segal.”\n“We see increased opportunities for our clients because of this transaction, allowing us to offer a wider range of services and to take on more projects concurrently,” added Dr. Paula Singer , The Singer Group’s chief executive officer and founder. “With our size as an independent firm, succession planning for our clients was becoming a concern. Now, as a part of Segal, we can offer continuity for these clients into the future. They will now receive Segal’s market-leading educational materials on compliance and benefits, as well as guidance to help them navigate the maze of laws and regulations related to benefit plans.”\nTwo principal employees from The Singer Group, Dr. Singer and Lorraine Kituri, are now part of Segal Waters Consulting. Dr. Singer is a vice president, and Ms. Kituri is an associate consultant. They will be based in Segal’s Washington, DC office.\n* * *\nThe Segal Group ( www.segalgroup.net ) is a private, employee-owned consulting firm headquartered in New York and with more than 1,000 employees throughout the U.S. and Canada. Members of The Segal Group include Segal Consulting, Sibson Consulting, Segal Select Insurance Services, Inc. and Segal Marco Advisors.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180312006180/en/\nThe Segal Group\nTodd Kohlhepp, 212-251-5087\ntkohlhepp@segalco.com\nSource: The Segal Group",
