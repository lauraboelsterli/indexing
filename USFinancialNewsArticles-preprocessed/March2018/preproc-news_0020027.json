The index has gained 4.8 percent this week, in its fourth straight weekly gain. ** China may allow its offshore-listed tech giants to sell a form of shares on the mainland, in a move that would pit Shanghai and Shenzhen against Hong Kong in the battle to host the country’s tech giants, Reuters reported on Monday. ** Beijing’s efforts to attract overseas-listed tech giants have revived long-dormant investor interest in technology shares, chipping away at the allure of blue-chips along the way. ** “The mention in government work report of fostering new drivers for economic growth and quickening the development of emerging technologies and industries, has drawn a lot of attention in the capital market,” Li Lifeng, analyst with Sinolink Securities, wrote in a note. ** From the perspective of Beijing’s policies, this year investors could focus on the so-called “blue-chips” in the tech sector, Li added, referring to leading start-up firms with reasonable valuations and solid results. ** The largest percentage gainers in the main Shanghai Composite index were Beijing Dynamic Power Co Ltd, up 10.09 percent, followed by Xinjiang Bai Hua Cun Co Ltd gaining 10.05 percent, and Shanghai U9 Game Co Ltd up by 10.01 percent. ** The largest percentage losers in the Shanghai index were Guangdong Hec Technology Holding Co Ltd, down 6.62 percent, followed by Top Energy Company Ltd Shanxi losing 3.57 percent and Chongqing Iron & Steel Co Ltd down by 3.49 percent. ** As of 07:04 GMT, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 28.04 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares.
