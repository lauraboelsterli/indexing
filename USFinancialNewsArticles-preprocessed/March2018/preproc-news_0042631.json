    "text": "South Korea is taking its crackdown on working overtime seriously.\nAfter approving a bill earlier this month to cut the maximum weekly work hours from 68 hours to a comparatively relaxed 52, the government has introduced an initiative to enforce these new rules.\nStarting at the end of March, the government will roll out a “shutdown initiative” for its employees, to be implemented in three phases. For the first phase, employees’ computers will be shut off at 8 p.m. on Fridays.\nIn the second phase, computers will be shut off by 7:30 p.m. on the second and fourth Friday of the month. And finally, in the third phase, due to begin in May, computers will turn off by 7 p.m. every Friday.\nGovernment employees in South Korea out-work its counterparts in other countries by close to 1,000 hours a year. The government hopes that the new initiative will force its employees to begin leaving on time.\nJapan, another country that suffers from chronic over-work, has similarly attempted to implement measures to cut back workers’ hours. Last year, after a woman committed suicide due to overwork , the government rolled out ‘ Premium Fridays ,’ which gives employees the option of leaving work early on the last Friday of the month. Yet in the year since it was launched, only 11% of the workforce has participated , according to government sources.\nIt remains to be seen whether the automatic nature of Seoul’s initiative will drive higher levels of compliance.",
