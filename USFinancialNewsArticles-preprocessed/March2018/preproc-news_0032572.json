    "text": "March 19, 2018 / 10:59 AM / Updated 23 minutes ago Rugby-Hosts Japan to start 2019 World Cup against Romania Reuters Staff 1 Min Read March 19 (Reuters) - Hosts Japan will open their 2019 World Cup campaign against Romania, who qualified for the tournament after Spain slumped to a shock 18-10 defeat by Belgium in the Rugby Europe Championship on Sunday. Spainâ€™s loss meant Romania finished second in the standings behind already-qualified Georgia and the Romanians join Japan, Ireland and Scotland in World Cup Pool A. Japan and Romania meet in the first match of the World Cup at the Tokyo Stadium on Sept. 20, 2019. The final team in Pool A will be decided via a two-legged playoff in June between Samoa and the runners-up of European qualifying. Spain need to beat Portugal in a playoff to make the two-legged tie against Samoa in order to reach the World Cup. If they beat Portugal but lose to Samoa, Spain will play in a four-team repechage event in November in a last attempt to make the tournament for the second time following their appearance in 1999.
