    "text": "BATON ROUGE, LA, March 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clikia Corp. (OTC PINK: CLKA), provider of ClikiaTV, a streaming (over-the-top, OTT) cable television subscription service, today discussed its upcoming Q2 social-media focused marketing effort to grow its subscriber base. The company believes that the addition of its cloud-based DVR service to its already-strong streaming cable television subscription service will provide critical weight to its upcoming marketing push.\nDavid Loflin, CLKA’s CEO, stated, “The acquisition of subscribers: our sole focus going forward. We see our social-media focused marketing strategy benefiting greatly from the addition of our cloud-based DVR service – it helps ClikiaTV ‘check all the boxes.’ We like to say the DVR service provides gravitas,” Mr. Loflin continued. “We believe that our DVR service will be an excellent enhancement to our excellent ClikiaTV subscription service, one that will allow ClikiaTV to remain well positioned, going forward, in the highly fragmented OTT/streaming space.” Mr. Loflin added further that the DVR service would satisfy ClikiaTV’s subscribers’ number one request: an easy-to-use, cloud-based DVR that offers immediate play-back capability.\nAbout ClikiaTV, a Streaming Cable Television Subscription Service. ClikiaTV’s 40+ cable television channels are delivered to any device via the Clikia App (available in the iTunes Store, the Google Play Store, on Amazon and Roku, and via Google Chromecast, as well as through its inter-connected www.Clikia.com website) . ClikiaTV competes in the rapidly expanding “over-the-top” marketplace, an extremely attractive and active marketplace positioned at the very center of the inevitable, unstoppable merger of two dynamic universes: television and digital video.\nWhat is “Over-the-top”? “Over-the-top,” or OTT, is the term used to describe the delivery of film and TV content via the Internet, without requiring users to subscribe to a traditional cable or satellite pay-TV service, like Comcast or Time Warner Cable.\nThis Press Release contains within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
