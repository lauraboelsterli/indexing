    "text": "MONTREAL and WAKEFIELD, Mass., March 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alithya Group Inc. (“Alithya”), a Québec private corporation with annual revenues above C$200M, and Edgewater Technology, Inc. (“Edgewater”) (NASDAQ:EDGW), a Delaware corporation listed on NASDAQ (EDGW ) with annual revenues above US$100M, are pleased to announce they have entered into an arrangement agreement (the “Arrangement Agreement”) to create a North American digital technology transformation leader with over 2,000 professionals. The current CEO of Alithya, Paul Raymond, will become CEO of the combined company.\nThe combined company will be a digital technology disruptor in a rapidly evolving economy, as well as one of the most prominent firms in the digital technology and consulting field in the United States and Canada, with a presence in France and the United Kingdom. The combined company will have particular strength in the sectors of finance, insurance, telecommunications, energy, manufacturing, retail & distribution, transportation, healthcare and government services.\nMore information on the transaction and the combined company will be provided in an investor presentation to be filed on each of the company’s website.\nUnder the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, Alithya shareholders and Edgewater shareholders will each exchange all of their respective outstanding shares for shares in a newly-formed holding company (“New Alithya”), of which Alithya and Edgewater will be wholly-owned subsidiaries. Alithya and Edgewater will implement the combination by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement pursuant to the Business Corporations Act (Québec) and merger pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law (together, the “Arrangement”). Alithya and Edgewater anticipate that, on the effective time of the Arrangement (the “Effective Time”), the former Alithya shareholders will hold approximately 58% of New Alithya’s total outstanding shares and the former Edgewater shareholders will hold the remaining 42%. In addition, Edgewater shareholders will be paid in cash a special dividend of US$20.5 million, subject to certain adjustments, including the amount of cash generated by Edgewater between signing of the Arrangement Agreement and closing of the Arrangement. The Arrangement is expected to occur on a tax-deferred rollover basis for United States residents. Upon completion of the Arrangement, the combined company will retain the name of Alithya Group Inc. and is expected to be listed on NASDAQ and the TSX.\n“We are extremely pleased to have reached an agreement with Edgewater”, stated Pierre Turcotte, Chairman of Alithya’s Board of Directors. “We are very excited to welcome over 400 experts from Edgewater to the Alithya family. The expertise of our two companies is very complementary and will immediately benefit all our clients as well as offer greater opportunities to our consultants and shareholders.”\nPaul Raymond, CEO of Alithya, also added: “Today, clients are looking for digital technology consulting companies that are strategic partners, understand their reality, and have the flexibility to rapidly integrate packaged solutions or deliver tailored solutions to best meet their business objectives. They want a partner who is agile and can rapidly make a difference for their business. This approach and the quality of our people have positioned us as one of the fastest growing companies in our sector. We believe that, together with Edgewater, we can pursue growth while maintaining the values that have set us apart. This is why we are convinced that bringing our companies together is a great outcome for our clients, our consultants and our respective shareholders.”\n“This transaction will give Edgewater the scale and depth required to compete at a superior level”, mentioned Jeffrey Rutherford, interim CEO and Chairman of Edgewater’s Board of Directors. “We went through a very detailed strategic process and were very impressed by Alithya’s management and reputation as a growing corporation. We believe the combination with Alithya is our best alternative to ensure the ongoing high-quality services to our customers, to give our consultants better career opportunities and to also provide our shareholders with solid, long-term growth perspectives.”\n“We believe the combination of Edgewater and Alithya creates a differentiated, leading North American IT platform and provides significant value for existing Edgewater shareholders through a meaningful dividend at close and opportunity for further upside as revenue and cost synergies are achieved.” explained Fred DiSanto, Chairman and CEO of Ancora Advisors, LLC. “We are enthusiastic about the strategic direction of the combined company and are excited to work with Alithya’s management team to maximize value for all shareholders.”\nBenefits of the Arrangement\nThe Boards of Directors of Alithya and Edgewater are unified in their belief that the combination will provide substantial benefits to shareholders, including the following:\nEstablishes a larger platform for the combined company to pursue its disciplined build-and-buy strategy while capitalizing on the sizeable growing demand for digital technology services;\nSignificant and lasting revenue synergies by reinforcing Edgewater’s core consulting competencies in certain Canadian markets and similarly leveraging Alithya’s core consulting competencies in several United States markets where Edgewater is operating;\nA leadership position in the implementation of ORACLE EBS, EPM and ERP Cloud as well as Microsoft ERP and CRM Cloud solutions;\nIncreased revenue diversification with greater consulting coverage;\nSignificant cost synergies stemming from the optimization of corporate functions; and\nEnhanced capital markets presence, a potential lower cost of capital, enhanced liquidity and an opportunity for re-valuation.\nSummary of the Arrangement Terms\nAt closing of the transaction, New Alithya is expected to list its common shares (“New Alithya common shares”) on NASDAQ and the TSX\nEdgewater shareholders will receive New Alithya common shares based on an exchange ratio of 1.3118 New Alithya common shares for each Edgewater share\nIn addition, Edgewater shareholders will be paid in cash a special dividend of US$20.5 million, subject to certain adjustments including the amount of cash generated by Edgewater between signing of the Arrangement Agreement and closing of the Arrangement\nNew Alithya will acquire Alithya as a wholly-owned subsidiary by issuing New Alithya common shares to current Alithya shareholders and equivalent New Alithya multi-voting shares to current Alithya multi-voting shareholders\nNew Alithya multi-voting shares will be equivalent in all respects to New Alithya common shares except that each New Alithya multi-voting share will have 10 votes per share; however, holders of New Alithya multi-voting shares will not be permitted to transfer such shares except to their respective affiliates and any holder of New Alithya multi-voting shares wishing to sell in the future must first convert such shares into New Alithya common shares on a one for one basis\nAlthough Alithya and Edgewater anticipate that, on the Effective Time, the former Alithya shareholders will hold approximately 58% of New Alithya’s total outstanding shares and the former Edgewater shareholders the remaining 42%, the former Alithya shareholders will hold on the Effective Time approximately 83%, and the former Edgewater shareholders approximately 17%, of the voting power of the total outstanding New Alithya shares\nLeadership of the Combined Company\nPaul Raymond will become New Alithya’s CEO, Claude Rousseau (Alithya’s current COO) will become New Alithya’s COO and Mathieu Lupien (Alithya’s current CFO) will become New Alithya’s CFO\nNew Alithya’s Board of Directors will consist of nine directors, of whom six will be nominated by Alithya’s current board and three by Edgewater’s current board, with Pierre Turcotte acting as the Chairman\nConditions to the Arrangement\nThe Arrangement will be subject to shareholder approval of both Edgewater and Alithya at special shareholder meetings.
