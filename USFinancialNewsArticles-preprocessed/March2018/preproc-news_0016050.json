    "text": "March 8 (Reuters) - Insys Therapeutics Inc reported a bigger fourth-quarter loss compared with a year earlier, hurt by higher costs and soft demand for Subsys, an opioid cancer pain medication at the center of a federal probe of the company.\nThe drugmaker said on Thursday net loss was $47 million or 65 cents per share in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with $3.7 million or 5 cents per share, a year earlier.\nRevenue fell 42.6 percent to $31.5 million.\nInsys has been embroiled in legal problems since October last year when founder John Kapoor resigned from Insysâ€™ board of directors after being arrested on charges that he participated in a scheme to bribe doctors to prescribe Subsys.
