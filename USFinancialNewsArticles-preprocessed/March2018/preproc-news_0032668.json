Soccer Football - Premier League - Crystal Palace vs Newcastle United - Selhurst Park, London, Britain - February 4, 2018 Crystal Palace's Wilfried Zaha Action Images via Reuters/Matthew Childs Although delighted to have his key attacker back in his line-up, however, Palace manager Roy Hodgson is wary of piling too much pressure on the team’s talisman. The Ivorian’s absence through injury hit 18th-placed Palace hard as they have slipped back into the relegation zone, losing their last four games.

But Hodgson is wary of expectations on Zaha being too high. “There’s a lot of pressure being put on him. Neither Wilf nor I can guarantee that he can find that level of form again – we hope so, and we believe he will and Wilfried Zaha will do his absolute best to show that, but I would rather not put him under that much pressure myself...when you focus the spotlight so much on one person it can be very dangerous,” he said. Huddersfield stunned Palace with a 3-0 win at Selhurst Park on the opening day of the season and Town midfielder Jonathan Hogg says that will fire up the visitors even more. “I think they are going to want a bit of revenge after us stuffing them 3-0 but at this stage of the season everyone is fighting, everyone wants the points on the board so we need to stick to what we have been doing,” he said. David Wagner’s side have climbed to 15th after recent wins over Bournemouth and West Bromwich Albion but they remain only four points above Palace and the relegation zone.
