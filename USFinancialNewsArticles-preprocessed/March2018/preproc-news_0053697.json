    "text": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday, with Brent falling back below $70 per barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crudes dipping below $65, pulled down by a report of increasing U.S. crude inventories that surprised many traders.\nnothing to do with the article U.S. WTI crude futures CLc1 were at $64.86 a barrel by 0201 GMT, down 39 cents, or 0.6 percent, from their previous settlement.\nFILE PHOTO: An oil well pump jack is seen at an oil field supply yard near Denver, Colorado, U.S., February 2, 2015. REUTERS/Rick Wilking/File Photo Brent crude futures LCOc1 were at $69.75 per barrel, down 36 cents, or 0.5 percent.\nTraders said the dips came after the American Petroleum Institute (API) late on Tuesday reported a surprise 5.3 million barrels rise in crude sticks in the week to March 23, to 430.6 million barrels.\nOfficial U.S. inventory data will be published by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) late on Wednesday.\n“We’ll see how the inventory data looks and whether these recent highs can be challenged again. For the moment it is looking like both WTI and Brent are stalling,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.\nWednesday’s price falls came despite top exporter Saudi Arabia saying it was working with top producer Russia on a historic long-term pact that could extend controls over world crude supplies by major exporters for many years.\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Reuters that Riyadh and Moscow were considering greatly extending a short-term alliance on oil curbs that began in January 2017 after a crash in crude prices.\n“We are working to shift from a year-to-year agreement to a 10 to 20 year agreement,” the crown prince told Reuters in an interview in New York late on Monday.\n123456789 sally test big number AxiTrader’s McKenna said such an agreement between Russia and Saudi Arabia “effectively means an expansion” of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which Saudi Arabia is the de-facto leader but in which Russia is not a member.\nIn Asia, Shanghai crude oil futures saw their third day of trading continuing with high volume but also volatility.\nSpot Shanghai crude futures ISCc1 were down by 4.4 percent on Wednesday, to 407.5 yuan ($64.93)per barrel by 0201 GMT.\nIn dollar-terms, that puts Chinese crude prices significantly below Brent and only slightly above U.S. WTI.\nsally backstory title sallytest Backstory sponsored McKenna said he hoped Shanghai crude “gets a lot of traction and we end up with three established global benchmarks”, but he cautioned that “the first couple of days have been volatile.”\nThe Reuters editorial and news staff had no role in the production of this content.
