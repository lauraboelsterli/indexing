    "text": "Apple's iPhone X may not have wooed Asian consumers during the Lunar New Year holiday â€” but the company has some new products in the pipeline, according to Rosenblatt Securities' Jun Zhang.\nZhang chopped 5.5 million units off expectations for iPhone X sales for the first half of this year in a Wednesday research note. But with sales of high-end smartphones shrinking, Apple could offset lower iPhone sales with new products.\nChesnot | Getty Images Customers looking at the Apple iPhone X \"We are not surprised with the quick cooldown of iPhone X sales following Chinese New Year,\" Zhang wrote. \"Further iPhone X cuts, in our view, suggest the high-end smartphone market upgrade cycle continues to extend. We are seeing similar issues for Samsung's S9 model since our research suggests that preorders are weak.\"\nApple and Samsung , like many tech companies, and rarely release data on new products or unit sales outside of quarterly reports or launch events. But, Zhang wrote, Apple could sell 6 million to 8 million iPad Pro units with more advanced 3-D sensing, as well as new phones in the fall.\nA new red iPhone model, lower-end iPhones and a lower-priced HomePod might also be in the works, Zhang said. (Apple has had a partnership with HIV/AIDS organization (RED) for over a decade, and often sells red-colored products to support AIDS research and prevention.)\n\"Since we expect the overall smartphone market to be flat this year, particularly in the mid-to-high end markets, Apple's upcoming lower priced iPhone model could drive Apple's unit growth,\" Zhang wrote.",
