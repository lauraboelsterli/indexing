    "text": "CHICAGO, March 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Board of Directors of Duff & Phelps Global Utility Income Fund Inc. (NYSE: DPG), a closed-end fund advised by Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co., today authorized the payment of dividends on its common stock as follows:\nCents Per Share\nEx-Date\nRecord Date\nPayable Date\n$0.35\nJune 14, 2018\nJune 15, 2018\nJune 29, 2018\nThe fund adopted a Managed Distribution Plan (the \"Plan\") in 2015 to maintain its current 35 cent per share distribution rate. Under the Plan, the fund will distribute all available investment income to its shareholders, consistent with the fund's investment objective. If and when sufficient investment income is not available on a quarterly basis, the fund will distribute realized capital gains and/or return of capital to its shareholders in order to maintain the 35 cent per share distribution level.\nThe following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the fund's March quarterly distribution to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 15, 2018 (ex-date March 14, 2018), payable March 29, 2018, together with the cumulative distributions paid this fiscal year to date from the following sources. All amounts are expressed per share of common stock based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles which may differ from federal income tax regulations.\nDistribution Estimates\nMarch 2018 (QTD)\nYear-to-date (YTD)\n(Sources)\nPer Share\nAmount\n% of\nCurrent\nDistribution\nPer Share\nAmount\n% of\nCumulative\nDistributions\nNet Investment Income\n$ 0.047\n13.4%\n$ 0.101\n14.5%\nNet Realized Foreign Currency Gains\n-\n0.0%\n-\n0.0%\nNet Realized Short-Term Capital Gains\n0.009\n2.7%\n0.010\n1.3%\nNet Realized Long-Term Capital Gains\n0.289\n82.5%\n0.292\n41.8%\nReturn of Capital (or other Capital Source)\n0.005\n1.4%\n0.297\n42.4%\nTotal\n$ 0.350\n100.0%\n$ 0.700\n100.0%\nAs of February 28, 2018\nAverage annual total return on NAV for the 5 years\n2.72%\nAnnualized current distribution rate as a percentage of NAV\n8.81%\nCumulative total return on NAV for the fiscal year\n-7.23%\nCumulative fiscal year distributions as a percentage of NAV\n2.20%\nThe fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'.\nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the fund's investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The fund or your broker will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\nThe fund will issue a separate 19(a) notice at the time of each quarterly distribution using the most current financial information available.\nAbout the Fund\nDuff & Phelps Global Utility Income Fund Inc. is a closed-end investment management company whose investment objective is to seek total return, resulting primarily from (i) a high level of current income, with an emphasis on providing tax-advantaged dividend income and (ii) growth in current income, and secondarily from capital appreciation.
