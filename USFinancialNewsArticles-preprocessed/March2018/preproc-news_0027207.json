We believe that the Non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are useful for understanding and assessing underlying business performance and operating trends, and management and investors benefit from referring to these Non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our financial performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. For more information on these Non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \"Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results\" set forth at the end of this press release.\nA limitation of using Non-GAAP financial measures excluding share-based compensation expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets is that share-based compensation expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets have been – and will continue to be – significant recurring expenses in the Company's business. You should not view Non-GAAP results on a stand-alone basis or as a substitute for results under GAAP, or as being comparable to results reported or forecasted by other companies.\nFor investor and media inquiries, please contact:\nChina\nMary Chen\nInvestor Relations Director\nTuniu Corporation\nPhone: +86-25-6960-9988\nE-mail: ir@tuniu.com\n(Financial Tables Follow)\nTuniu Corporation\nUnaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(All amounts in thousands, except per share information)\nDecember 31, 2016\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2017\nRMB\nRMB\nUS$\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents\n1,085,236\n484,101\n74,405\nRestricted cash\n124,561\n91,810\n14,111\nShort-term investments\n3,603,497\n3,084,634\n474,100\nAccounts receivable, net\n235,673\n286,627\n44,054\nAmounts due from related parties\n390,330\n171,331\n26,333\nPrepayments and other current assets\n1,632,329\n939,463\n144,393\nYield enhancement products and accrued interest\n449,528\n31,337\n4,816\nTotal current assets\n7,521,154\n5,089,303\n782,212\nNon-current assets\nLong term investments\n58,764\n484,991\n74,542\nProperty and equipment, net\n177,817\n148,278\n22,790\nIntangible assets, net\n592,267\n460,634\n70,798\nGoodwill\n147,639\n147,639\n22,692\nYield enhancement products over one year and\naccrued interest\n562,643\n170,505\n26,206\nOther non-current assets\n46,468\n156,455\n24,047\nLong-term amounts due from related parties\n64,902\n-\n-\nTotal non-current assets\n1,650,500\n1,568,502\n241,075\nTotal assets\n9,171,654\n6,657,805\n1,023,287\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable\n1,022,704\n852,500\n131,027\nAmounts due to related parties\n32,526\n86,923\n13,360\nSalary and welfare payable\n192,455\n187,561\n28,828\nTaxes payable\n11,619\n32,036\n4,924\nAdvances from customers\n1,806,493\n1,210,615\n186,068\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n589,288\n373,690\n57,435\nAmounts due to the individual investors of yield\nenhancement products\n871,914\n177,971\n27,354\nTotal current liabilities\n4,526,999\n2,921,296\n448,996\nNon-current liabilities\n54,928\n42,481\n6,529\nTotal liabilities\n4,581,927\n2,963,777\n455,525\nMezzanine equity\nRedeemable noncontrolling interests\n90,072\n96,719\n14,865\nShareholders' equity\nOrdinary shares\n242\n248\n38\nLess: Treasury stock\n(19,708)\n(185,419)\n(28,498)\nAdditional paid-in capital\n8,855,991\n9,013,793\n1,385,395\nAccumulated other comprehensive income\n400,925\n272,386\n41,865\nAccumulated deficit\n(4,738,593)\n(5,505,897)\n(846,241)\nTotal Tuniu's shareholders' equity\n4,498,857\n3,595,111\n552,559\nNoncontrolling interests\n798\n2,198\n338\nTotal Shareholders' equity\n4,499,655\n3,597,309\n552,897\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity\n9,171,654\n6,657,805\n1,023,287\nTuniu Corporation\nUnaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss\n(All amounts in thousands, except per share information)\nQuarter Ended\nQuarter Ended\nQuarter Ended\nQuarter Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\nSeptember 30, 2017\nDecember 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2017\nRMB\nRMB\nRMB\nUS$\nRevenues\nPackaged tours\n1,847,888\n604,047\n290,054\n44,580\nOthers\n105,505\n202,038\n179,832\n27,640\nNet revenues\n1,953,393\n806,085\n469,886\n72,220\nCost of revenues\n(1,778,914)\n(365,206)\n(234,733)\n(36,078)\nGross profit\n174,479\n440,879\n235,153\n36,142\nOperating expenses\nResearch and product development\n(170,123)\n(123,974)\n(111,151)\n(17,084)\nSales and marketing\n(398,095)\n(224,808)\n(193,696)\n(29,771)\nGeneral and administrative\n(205,500)\n(165,874)\n(154,490)\n(23,745)\nOther operating income\n11,070\n7,757\n3,348\n515\nTotal operating expenses\n(762,648)\n(506,899)\n(455,989)\n(70,085)\nLoss from operations\n(588,169)\n(66,020)\n(220,836)\n(33,943)\nOther income/(expenses)\nInterest income\n21,704\n39,864\n44,426\n6,828\nForeign exchange gains/(losses), net\n(1,702)\n1,908\n(2,009)\n(309)\nOther loss, net\n(2,310)\n(174)\n(147)\n(23)\nLoss before income tax expense\n(570,477)\n(24,422)\n(178,566)\n(27,447)\nIncome taxes benefit /(expense)\n2,610\n(2,583)\n(7,569)\n(1,163)\nNet loss\n(567,867)\n(27,005)\n(186,135)\n(28,610)\nNet income/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling\ninterests\n(6,838)\n609\n(2,939)\n(452)\nNet income/(loss) attributable to redeemable\nnoncontrolling interests\n(34)\n514\n(93)\n(14)\nNet loss attributable to Tuniu Corporation\n(560,995)\n(28,128)\n(183,103)\n(28,144)\nAccretion on redeemable noncontrolling interest\n(106)\n(1,177)\n(1,757)\n(270)\nNet loss attributable to ordinary shareholders\n(561,101)\n(29,305)\n(184,860)\n(28,414)\nNet loss\n(567,867)\n(27,005)\n(186,135)\n(28,610)\nOther comprehensive income/(loss):\nForeign currency translation adjustment,\nnet of nil tax\n141,523\n(36,143)\n(24,770)\n(3,807)\nComprehensive loss\n(426,344)\n(63,148)\n(210,905)\n(32,417)\nLoss per share\nNet loss per ordinary share attributable to\nordinary shareholders -
