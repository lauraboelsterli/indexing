    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” The Trump administration violated federal law when it failed to meet a deadline to identify all parts of the U.S. that don't meet air quality standards for smog, a federal judge ruled on Monday.\nU.S. District Judge Haywood Gilliam ordered the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to complete the designations by the end of April.\nHis ruling was for two lawsuits, including one filed by California, 13 other states and the District of Columbia.\nThe EPA had until October 1, 2017, to designate what parts of the country were in and out of compliance with tougher smog standards adopted during the Obama administration.\nThe states' lawsuit said smog can cause or aggravate diseases including heart disease, bronchitis and emphysema, and the new standards would save hundreds of lives each year.\nThe designations trigger a process that forces polluted regions to take steps to improve air quality.\nAn email for comment sent to the U.S. Department of Justice was not immediately returned.\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement on Monday that the state will \"closely monitor\" the EPA to make sure it meets the court's order.\n\"We stand ready to do what's necessary to ensure that the EPA does not shirk its legal responsibilities,\" he said.\nThe EPA acknowledged that it violated the Clean Air Act by failing to issue the air quality designations by the October 1 deadline, but said it was moving fast and would complete the process no later than April 30, according to Gilliam's ruling.\nGilliam rejected the states' request that the EPA move faster on some designations and make all designations effective immediately.\nBecerra and Democratic officials in other states have repeatedly clashed with the Trump administration over the its push to loosen environmental regulations.\nBecerra was joined in the smog suit by the attorneys general in Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. Minnesota's Pollution Control Agency also joined the suit.",
