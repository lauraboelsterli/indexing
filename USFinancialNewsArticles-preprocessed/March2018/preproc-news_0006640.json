    "text": "March 8, 2018 / 12:10 AM / Updated 27 minutes ago Former Uber CEO Kalanick to start fund called '10100' Reuters Staff 1 Min Read (Reuters) - Travis Kalanick, the former Uber chief executive, announced on Wednesday in a Twitter post that he is going to start an investment fund called 10100.

REUTERS/Jane Ross The overarching theme of the new fund, pronounced “ten-one-hundred”, will be to invest in real estate, ecommerce and emerging innovation in China and India, Kalanick said in a tweet. The fund will oversee for-profit investments as well as non-profit work and focus on education and future of cities, Kalanick said. ( bit.ly/2Fqtq3M ) Twitter was abuzz with speculation behind the meaning of the new fund’s name. One user suggested that it could be a reference “Googol” or “10 to the power 100.” Kalanick was not immediately available to respond to additional queries regarding his new venture. Kalanick, co-founder the San Francisco-based ride hailing startup Uber, resigned in June under pressure from investors after a string of setbacks.
