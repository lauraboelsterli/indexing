    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Volt Information Sciences, Inc. (“Volt” or “the Company”) (NYSE-AMERICAN: VISI) , an international provider of staffing services and managed service programs, today reported results for its fiscal 2018 first quarter ended January 28, 2018. Key highlights include:\nFirst quarter net revenue of $253.3 million, down 19.1% year-over-year; on a same-store basis, net revenue declined 10.6% year-over-year excluding net revenue contributed from businesses sold or exited during the past year and the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations Successfully completed new long-term $115.0 million accounts receivable securitization program with DZ BANK AG Deutsche Zentral-Genossenschaftsbank (“DZ Bank”), improving the Company’s available liquidity and lowering borrowing costs Global liquidity of $78.8 million at quarter-end, up $34.8 million year-over-year; total outstanding debt of $80.0 million, down $17.1 million year-over-year and further reduced in February by $30.0 million to a current level of $50.0 million\nCommenting on Volt’s first quarter performance, Michael Dean, President and CEO, said, “Overall, Volt’s first quarter results were mixed. We continue to benefit from our ongoing focus on achieving operational efficiencies and managing expenses, which has enabled the Company to consistently deliver lower selling, administrative and other operating costs. However, our ability to generate top line growth continues to be impacted by lower revenues in our North American Staffing segment, driven in part by a single large customer that has significantly reduced their reliance on temporary staffing. Excluding this customer from the current and prior periods, revenue declines over the past several quarters have been smaller and relatively steady. And as previously outlined, our entire team is actively implementing detailed initiatives to turn the top line.”\nMr. Dean continued, “I am very pleased with the new $115.0 million long-term financing agreement completed during the quarter with DZ Bank. We expect to save approximately $1.5 million over the term of the new agreement, driven by improved pricing as well as lower fees compared with our previous financing program. Along with the better pricing, the new facility has less restrictive financial covenants and fewer restrictions on use of proceeds. In fact, the new facility provides more available liquidity than our previous facility that had a capacity of $160.0 million. Overall, this financing program greatly enhances our financial flexibility and debt maturity profile, while providing the Company with additional resources to execute our business strategy and advance our capital allocation plan.”\nFiscal 2017 First Quarter Results\nTotal revenue for the fiscal 2018 first quarter was $253.3 million, down $59.7 million, or 19.1%, compared to $313.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. On a same-store basis, net revenue declined 10.6% year-over-year excluding net revenue contributed from businesses sold or exited during the past year and the effect of currency fluctuations.\nNorth American Staffing revenue, which provides a broad spectrum of contingent staffing, direct placement, recruitment process outsourcing and other employment services, was $206.2 million, a $25.7 million, or 11.1% decrease, compared to North American Staffing revenue of $231.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The decline was driven by lower demand from customers in both professional and commercial job families, as well as a significant change in a large customer’s contingent labor strategy in the latter part of fiscal 2017.\nInternational Staffing revenue, which includes the Company’s contingent staffing, direct placement and managed service programs businesses in Europe and Asia, was $29.6 million, a $0.8 million, or 2.5% decrease, compared to $30.4 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, revenue declined $3.2 million on a constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The decline was primarily a result of softening economic demand in the United Kingdom, offset by strong growth in Belgium and Singapore.\nCorporate and Other revenue, which now primarily consists of the Company’s North American managed service business and the Company’s call center business, was $18.7 million, down $33.3 million, or 64.0%, compared to $52.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The year-over-year revenue decline was primarily driven by the impact from the sale of Maintech and the quality assurance business, which occurred early in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively. On a same-store basis, excluding businesses sold or exited of $32.0 million, Corporate and Other revenue decreased $1.3 million, or 6.3%, year-over-year, as a result of winding down of certain programs in the Company’s managed service business as well as normal fluctuations in call center activity.\nSelling, administrative and other operating costs in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased $2.0 million, or 4.0%, to $46.9 million from $48.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. This decrease was primarily due to ongoing cost reductions throughout the business as well as the sale of Maintech and the quality assurance business. These decreases were partially offset by higher legal fees and depreciation and software license expenses related to the completion of the first phase of the upgrade of the Company’s back-office financial suite and information technology tools.\nLoss from continuing operations was $10.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, down $6.1 million compared to a loss of $4.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA, which is a Non-GAAP measure, was a loss of $9.1 million in the fiscal 2018 first quarter, down $8.6 million from a loss of $0.5 million (Non-GAAP) in the year ago period. Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of special items, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, other income/loss and share-based compensation expense. For a reconciliation of the GAAP and Non-GAAP financial results, please see the tables at the end of this press release.\nLiquidity\nAs of January 28, 2018, the Company had $78.8 million of global liquidity as compared to $44.0 million at January 29, 2017.\nCorporate Developments\nDuring the first quarter, the Company entered into a long-term accounts receivable securitization program with DZ Bank and exited its financing relationship with PNC Bank, National Association. Under the terms of the new agreement, DZ Bank will provide a two-year, $115.0 million facility which permits borrowings until January 25, 2020. The Company expects to save approximately $1.5 million over the term of the program and now has more available liquidity compared to its previous agreement. The new facility has less restrictive financial covenants and fewer restrictions on the use of proceeds, improving the Company’s available liquidity, enabling the Company to continue to advance its capital allocation plans.\nConference Call and Webcast\nA conference call and simultaneous webcast to discuss the fiscal 2018 first quarter financial results will be held today at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time / 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time.

(b) Relates to a discrete tax benefit resulting from the expiration of uncertain tax positions in Q1 2018. Note Regarding the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company has provided certain Non-GAAP financial information, which includes adjustments for special items and certain line items on a constant currency basis, as additional information for its segment revenue, consolidated net income (loss), segment operating income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and may be different from Non-GAAP measures reported by other companies.\nThe Company believes that the presentation of Non-GAAP measures on a constant currency basis and eliminating special items provides useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations because they permit evaluation of the results of the Company without the effect of currency fluctuations or special items that management believes make it more difficult to understand and evaluate the Company’s results of operations. Special items include impairments, restructuring and severance as well as certain income or expenses not indicative of the Company’s current or future period performance and are more fully disclosed in the tables.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings or loss before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) adjusted to exclude share-based compensation expense as well as the special items described above.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a performance measure rather than a cash flow measure. The Company believes the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view results in a manner similar to the method used by management.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, analysis of the Company’s results of operations and operating cash flows as reported under GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect capital expenditures or contractual commitments; does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Company’s working capital needs; does not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service the interest payments, on the Company’s debt; and does not reflect cash required to pay income taxes.\nThe Company’s computation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies because all companies do not calculate these measures in the same fashion.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180307006239/en/\nInvestor Contacts:\nVolt Information Sciences, Inc.\nvoltinvest@volt.com\nor\nAddo Investor Relations\nLasse Glassen, 424-238-6249\nlglassen@addoir.com\nSource: Volt Information Sciences, Inc.",
