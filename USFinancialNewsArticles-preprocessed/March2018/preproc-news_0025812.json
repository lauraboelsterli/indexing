Guidance is based on the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606.\nFirst quarter of fiscal 2019:\nTotal revenues are expected to be between $51.0 and $51.5 million. Subscription revenues are expected to be between $46.5 and $47.0 million. This includes a negative impact of approximately $1.5 million due to there being 3 fewer calendar days for our revenue recognition in Q1 compared to Q4. Professional services revenues are expected to be approximately $4.5 million. Approximately $2.0 million of professional services revenues recognized in Q4 of fiscal year 2018 were one-time in nature. Non-GAAP loss from operations is expected to be between $5.5 and $7.0 million. Non-GAAP net loss per share is expected to be between $0.11 loss and $0.13 loss per share. Basic and diluted weighted average share count is expected to be approximately 55.8 million shares.\nFull year fiscal 2019:\nTotal revenues are expected to be between $227 and $230 million. Non-GAAP loss from operations is expected to be between $11.0 and $14.0 million. Non-GAAP net loss per share is expected to be between $0.23 loss and $0.28 loss per share. Basic and diluted weighted average share count is expected to be approximately 57.2 million shares.\nSee the sections titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and the reconciliation tables below for important details regarding Coupa’s non-GAAP measures. Free cash flows are defined as operating cash flows plus investing cash flows, minus the impact of any cash paid for acquisitions. Free cash flow margin is defined as free cash flows divided by revenues.\nRecent Business Highlights:\nNew customer wins from Q4 include: Lululemon, Bass Pro Shops, Grupo Bimbo, Qatar Airways, Farmers Group, American Water Works Company, Jobvite, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), Co-operative Group, National Grid, National Gallery Singapore, Exabeam, ISS UK, CHT, Meritage Midstream Services, The Warehouse Group, American Zinc Recycling Corporation, Grupo Dasa, Members First Credit Union and San Mateo County libraries.\nLaunched Coupa Release 20 (R20) which addresses supply chain risk through Community Intelligence, complex services spend with Services Maestro, and early payment discounts with Coupa Accelerate.

International parties can access the call by dialing (719) 457-2607, using conference code 9186776.\nA live webcast will be accessible on Coupa’s investor relations website at http://investors.coupa.com . A replay will be available through the same link. A telephonic replay of the conference call will be available through Monday, March 19, 2018. To access the replay, parties in the U.S. and Canada should call (888) 203-1112 and enter conference code 9186776. International parties should call (719) 457-0820 and enter conference code 9186776.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures:\nIn addition to disclosing financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), this press release and the accompanying tables contain certain non-GAAP financial measures that exclude share-based compensation expense, litigation-related costs, amortization of intangible assets acquired, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs from our convertible notes and related tax effects. Coupa believes these non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating its operating performance and regularly reviews these measures as it evaluates its business.\nCoupa believes these non-GAAP measures provide investors and other users of its financial information consistency and comparability with its past financial performance and facilitate period to period comparisons of operations. Coupa believes these non-GAAP measures are useful in evaluating its operating performance compared to that of other companies in its industry, as they generally eliminate the effects of certain items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\nCoupa uses these non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of its overall assessment of its performance, including the preparation of its annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of its business strategies and to communicate with its board of directors concerning its financial performance. The definitions of its non-GAAP measures may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Thus, Coupa’s non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nCoupa compensates for these limitations by providing investors and other users of its financial information a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the related GAAP financial measures. Coupa encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure and to view its non-GAAP measures in conjunction with GAAP financial measures. Please see the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures attached to this release.\nWith respect to Coupa’s guidance as provided under “Business Outlook” above, Coupa has not reconciled its expectations for non-GAAP loss from operations to GAAP loss from operations or non-GAAP net loss per share to GAAP net loss per share because certain items excluded from non-GAAP operating loss and net loss, such as charges related to share-based compensation expense, litigation-related costs, amortization of intangible assets acquired, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs from our convertible notes, and related tax effects, cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at this time. The effect of these excluded items may be significant.\nWe also use key metrics such as cumulative spend under management, which represents the aggregate amount of money that has been transacted through our core Coupa platform for all of our customers collectively since we launched our platform. We calculate this metric by aggregating the actual transaction data, such as invoices, purchase orders and expenses, from customers on our core Coupa platform. While we do not believe this metric is directly correlated to our financial results, we believe the adoption of our core platform, as evidenced by growth in cumulative spend under management, drives additional value to our customers, which will enhance our ability to acquire new customers and to increase renewals and upsells to existing customers.\nForward-Looking Statements:\nThis release includes . All statements other than statements of historical facts, including the statements of management and statements in “Business Outlook\" are . These are based on Coupa’s current expectations and projections about future events and trends that Coupa believes may affect its financial condition, results of operations, strategy, short- and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs.\nThese are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results to differ materially, including: Coupa has a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to predict its future operating results; if Coupa is unable to attract new customers, the growth of its revenues will be adversely affected; because its platform is sold to large enterprises with complex operating environments, Coupa encounters long and unpredictable sales cycles; risks and liabilities related to breach of its security measures or unauthorized access to customer data; the markets in which Coupa participates are intensely competitive; Coupa’s business depends substantially on its customers renewing their subscriptions and purchasing additional subscriptions; if Coupa fails to develop widespread brand awareness cost-effectively, its business may suffer; and if Coupa fails to manage its recent rapid growth effectively, Coupa may be unable to execute its business plan, maintain high levels of service, or adequately address competitive challenges.\nThese and other risks and uncertainties that could affect Coupa’s future results are included under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in Coupa’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on December 7, 2017, which is available at investors.coupa.com and on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov . Further information on potential risks that could affect actual results will be included in other periodic filings Coupa makes with the SEC.\nThe in this release reflect Coupa’s expectations as of March 12, 2018. Coupa undertakes no obligation to update publicly any for any reason after the date of this release to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in its expectations.\nAbout Coupa Software\nCoupa Software (NASDAQ:COUP) is the cloud platform for business spend.
