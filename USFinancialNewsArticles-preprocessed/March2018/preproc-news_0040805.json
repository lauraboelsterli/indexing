Using a proprietary bait delivery method, ContraPest® is dispensed in a highly palatable liquid formulation that promotes sustained consumption by rat communities. ContraPest® is designed, formulated and dispensed to be low hazard for handlers and non-target species such as wildlife, livestock and pets, where the active ingredients break down rapidly. ContraPest® is a Restricted Use Pesticide.\nWe believe ContraPest® will establish a new paradigm in rodent control, resulting in a decreased reliance on lethal options.
