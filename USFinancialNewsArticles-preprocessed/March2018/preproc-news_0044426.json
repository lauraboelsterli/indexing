    "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he did not think talks with the United States on an exemption from tariffs on steel and aluminum could be concluded by May.\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker holds a news conference at a European Union leaders summit in Brussels, Belgium, March 23, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir “The United States are expecting us to conclude the negotiations, we will engage in the next coming days, until May 1, it doesn’t seem to me that this date is a very realistic one given the broad issues we have to discuss with the United States,” Juncker told a news conference after a meeting of the EU’s 28 leaders.\n“And so we will advocate a system where these exemptions in the European Union will be permanent, and not only temporary.”\nReporting by Jan Strupczewski and Philip Blenkinsop, writing by Julia Fioretti\n ",
