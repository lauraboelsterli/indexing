    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, March 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gran Tierra Energy Inc. (“Gran Tierra”) (NYSE American:GTE) (NYSE MKT:GTE) (TSX:GTE), a company focused on oil and gas exploration and production in Colombia today announces that it intends to implement a normal course issuer bid (the “ Bid ”) through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange (“ TSX ”). Pursuant to the Bid and subject to regulatory approval, Gran Tierra would be able to purchase for cancellation up to approximately 5% of its issued and outstanding shares of common stock (the “ Shares ”) for a one year period at prevailing market prices at the time of purchase.\nManagement of Gran Tierra believes that the Shares, at times, have been trading in a price range which does not adequately reflect their value in relation to Gran Tierra’s current operations, growth prospects and financial position. At such times, the purchase of Shares for cancellation or to satisfy awards granted under Gran Tierra’s 2007 Equity Incentive Plan may be advantageous to stockholders by increasing the value of the Shares. Gran Tierra currently has a strong balance sheet and, at current Brent oil prices, its cash from operating activities is expected to exceed its capital expenditures.\nWithin the past twelve months, Gran Tierra purchased 7,704,377 Shares at a volume weighted average price of C$3.07 under a previously approved normal course issuer bid through the facilities of the TSX and NYSE American (February 8, 2017 to February 7, 2018) permitting the purchase of up to 19,540,359 Shares.\nAbout Gran Tierra Energy Inc.\nGran Tierra Energy Inc. is an independent international energy company focused on oil and natural gas exploration and production in Colombia. The Company continues to pursue new growth opportunities, leveraging its financial strength. The Company's common shares trade on the NYSE American and the Toronto Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol GTE. Additional information concerning Gran Tierra is available at www.grantierra.com . Investor inquiries may be directed to info@grantierra.com or (403) 265-3221.\nGran Tierra’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings are available on the Securities and Exchange Commission website at http://www.sec.gov and on SEDAR at http://www.sedar.com .\nForward-Looking Statements and Advisories\nThis press release contains statements about future events that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and forward looking information within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities laws (collectively, “ forward-looking statements ”).
