MBTs originate from the discovery by CohBar’s founders of a novel group of peptides within the mitochondrial genome which regulate metabolism and cell death, and whose biological activity declines with age. CohBar’s development of these mitochondrial-derived peptides (MDPs) into clinically relevant MBTs offers the potential to address a broad range of age-related diseases, including obesity, fatty liver disease (NASH), type 2 diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. To date, the Company and its founders have discovered more than 100 biologically active MDPs.\nFor additional company information, please visit www.cohbar.com .\nInvestor and Media Contact:\nJeff Biunno, CFO\nCohBar, Inc.\n(650) 446-7888, Option 3\njeff.biunno@cohbar.com\nSource:CohBar, Inc.",
