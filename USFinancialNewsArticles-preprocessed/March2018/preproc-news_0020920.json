    "text": "Broadcom said in a letter to U.S. Congress on Friday that it will not sell any critical national security assets to any foreign companies if its $117 billion deal to buy chipmaker Qualcomm is approved.\nU.S. Republican lawmakers on Monday backed a U.S. panel's decision to delay Qualcomm's shareholder meeting to allow for a more extensive review of Broadcom's takeover bid.\n\"Qualcomm's work is too important to our national security to let it fall into the hands of a foreign company and in a hostile takeover no less,\" Senator Tom Cotton, a vocal Republican voice on foreign policy, had said.",
