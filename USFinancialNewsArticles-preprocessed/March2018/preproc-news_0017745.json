She had been one of Trump's earliest campaign aides and had been a senior White House official in his administration until last week.\nRead the full report on NBC News. \nWATCH: Hope Hicks resigns from White House role show chapters Hope Hicks resigns from White House role      9:45 AM ET Thu, 1 March 2018 | 01:50",
