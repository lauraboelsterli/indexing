This marks one of the final steps in the company’s brand refresh efforts following the merger between VTS and Hightower in 2016 – a move considered to be a major landmark in the CRE technology industry.\nThe website launch comes on the heels of the significant growth seen by VTS since the 2016 merger. The company’s customer base has grown to more than 28,000 users, up 87% since the merger. Square footage managed on the platform increased by 112% and now consists of more than 7B square feet of commercial office, retail and industrial space globally. Since the merger, 49,000 deals have been executed on VTS, with more than 325,000 currently active on the platform. The company has also expanded its international reach, with users in 28 countries.\nAs part of the merger, VTS and Hightower integrated each of their products’ strongest features into one platform. Now, with this brand refresh, VTS is finalizing the unification of the two companies and, through the new VTS.com , re-introducing itself to the market.\n“Post-merger, we saw ourselves as a new company,” said Nick Romito, Co-Founder and CEO of VTS. “Our unified firm emerged as a leader in the commercial real estate technology movement and we felt this milestone presented an important opportunity for us to explore, as a team, who we are as a company and what we stand for. This sparked a brand refresh exercise and we’re now proud to introduce a new identity that we believe powerfully communicates our vision to revolutionize commercial real estate through innovation.”\n“The leading commercial real estate landlords and brokers we work with are focused on driving digital change in order to increase their competitive edge and deliver market-leading services to tenants. VTS partners with these companies to facilitate such transformations and our new website enables us to provide more in-depth, actionable resources for firms looking for guidance and best practices on the hardest challenges they’re dealing with today.”\nVTS was founded by commercial real estate professionals with a passion for tackling the industry’s biggest challenges.
