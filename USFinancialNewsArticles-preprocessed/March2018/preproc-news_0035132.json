A damaged minibus is seen after a blast in Jalalabad, Afghanistan March 19, 2018.REUTERS/Parwiz The former commander, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, was not hurt in the blast that came 10 minutes after his rally ended, in the eastern city of Jalalabad, as people were leaving the site, said Attahullah Khogyani, spokesman for the provincial governor. Hekmatyar, a major figure in Afghanistanâ€™s decades of conflict who served as prime minister for a period during civil war in the 1990s, was in recent years allied with the Taliban.

No group has claimed responsibility for the blast. Nangarhar province, of which Jalalabad is capital, shares a long and porous border with Pakistan, and has recent years become a hotbed of militants affiliated to both Islamic State and the Taliban.
