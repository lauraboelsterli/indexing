We are confident in our ability to build a solid platform for the rapid and sustainable expansion of our securities services business in the coming quarters.\"\n\"Our joint venture with SINA began generating revenue during the quarter and we expect it to continue gaining growth momentum,\" added Mr. Hongchen Yu, Interim CFO of Yintech. \"We completed the acquisition of Forthright Securities during the quarter and will begin consolidating its revenues and profits during the first quarter of 2018, which we expect will further drive growth in our securities services business. In addition, we are pleased to announce that our board of directors has approved an annual dividend distribution of US$0.40 per ADS, which translates into a dividend yield of 4.0% based on our latest closing share price. We believe this demonstrates our solid financial position and strong commitment to creating value for our shareholders.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenues for the quarter were RMB386.1 million (US$59.3 million), a decrease of 63.6% from RMB1,061.7 million in the same quarter last year and a decrease of 0.6% from RMB388.3 million in the previous quarter. The decreases were mainly due to the decreases in net commissions and fees.\nNet commissions and fees for the quarter were RMB286.7 million (US$44.1 million), a decrease of 71.2% from RMB995.3 million in the same quarter last year and a decrease of 15.1% from RMB337.9 million in the previous quarter.\nNet commissions and fees from commodities services for the quarter were RMB273.7 million (US$42.1 million), a decrease of 18.2% from the previous quarter, primarily as a result of the decrease in customer trading volume. Customer trading volume was RMB717.1 billion (US$110.2 billion) during the quarter, a decrease of 15.3% from the previous quarter.\nNet commissions and fees from securities services for the quarter were RMB13.0 million (US$2.0 million), an increase of 303.6% from the previous quarter, mainly due to an increase in the number of paying customers for the Company's securities advisory services.\nEffective fee rate (representing net commissions and fees from commodities services as a percentage of customer trading volume) for the quarter was 0.038%, compared with 0.070% in the same quarter last year and 0.040% in the previous quarter.\nExpenses for the quarter were RMB421.4 million (US$64.8 million), a decrease of 38.4% from RMB684.3 million in the same quarter last year and an increase of 33.6% from RMB315.3 million in the previous quarter. The sequential increase was primarily attributable to an increase in employee compensation and benefits due to the payment of year-end discretionary compensation, as well as an increase in advertising and promotion expenses.\nNet loss for the quarter was RMB63.6 million (US$9.8 million), compared to net income of RMB337.7 million in the same quarter last year and net income of RMB66.5 million in the previous quarter.\nNet loss attributable to Yintech for the quarter was RMB54.6 million (US$8.4 million), compared to net income of RMB338.3 million in the same quarter last year and net income of RMB68.6 million in the previous quarter.\nDiluted loss per ADS for the quarter was RMB0.72 (US$0.11), compared with diluted earnings per ADS of RMB4.62 in the same quarter last year and diluted earnings per ADS of RMB0.94 in the previous quarter.\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to Yintech for the quarter was RMB61.4 million (US$9.4 million), a decrease of 87.5% from RMB489.9 million in the same quarter last year and a decrease of 39.2% from RMB101.0 million in the previous quarter.\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS for the quarter were RMB0.81 (US$0.12), compared with non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS of RMB6.69 in the same quarter last year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS of RMB1.38 in the previous quarter.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenues for the full year 2017 were RMB2,448.9 million (US$376.4 million), a decrease of 10.0% from RMB2,719.5 million for the full year 2016, mainly due to the decrease in net commissions and fees.\nNet commissions and fees for the full year 2017 were RMB2,198.6 million (US$337.9 million), a decrease of 13.7% from RMB2,547.0 million for the full year 2016.\nNet commissions and fees from commodities services for the full year 2017 were RMB2,177.9 million, a decrease of 14.5% from RMB2,547.0 million for the full year 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the effective fee rate following the termination of trading on local exchanges, which was partially offset by a 29.0% increase in customer trading volume to RMB3,841.1 billion (US$590.4 billion), from RMB2,978.3 billion for the full year 2016.\nNet commissions and fees from securities services for the full year 2017 were RMB20.7 million (US$3.2 million), compared to nil for the full year 2016.\nEffective fee rate (representing net commissions and fees as a percentage of customer trading volume) for the full year 2017 was 0.057%, compared with 0.086% for the full year 2016.\nExpenses for the full year 2017 were RMB1,812.4 million (US$278.6 million), an increase of 8.6% from RMB1,668.4 million for the full year 2016, primarily attributable to increases in employee compensation and benefits as well as occupancy and equipment rental expenses.\nNet income for the full year 2017 was RMB467.0 million (US$71.8 million), a decrease of 49.6% from RMB925.7 million for the full year 2016.\nNet income attributable to Yintech for the full year 2017 was RMB480.7 million (US$73.9 million), a decrease of 48.4% from RMB930.7 million for the full year 2016.\nDiluted earnings per ADS for the full year 2017 were RMB6.65 (US$1.02), compared with diluted earnings per ADS of RMB14.92 for the full year 2016.\nNon-GAAP net income attributable to Yintech for the full year 2017 was RMB691.6 million (US$106.3 million), a decrease of 37.6% from RMB1,108.2 million for the full year 2016.\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS for the full year 2017 were RMB9.56 (US$1.47), compared with non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS of RMB17.76 for the full year 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash of RMB690.5 million (US$106.1 million) and short term investments of RMB1,212.0 million (US$186.3 million), compared with RMB1,541.2 million and RMB218.9 million as of December 31, 2016, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Total shareholders' equity of Yintech was RMB3,576.2 million (US$549.7 million), compared with RMB3,316.0 million as of December 31, 2016.\nBusiness Outlook\nBased on the information available as of the date of this press release, Yintech provides the following outlook, which reflects the Company's current and preliminary view, takes into account the fewer number of trading days during the first quarter due to the Chinese New Year holiday, and is subject to change:\n2018 First Quarter Guidance\nCustomer trading volume will be in the range of RMB470 billion to RMB490 billion. Revenues will be in the range of RMB260 million to RMB280 million.\nDividend\nYintech's board of directors has approved a dividend of US$0.40 per ADS for full year 2017, which is expected to be paid on or around April 9, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 27, 2017.\nThe Company maintains a strong commitment to creating value for its shareholders through dividends, while the timing, amount and form of future dividends, will depend on, among other things, the Company's future results of operations and cash flow, capital requirements and surplus, the amount of distributions, if any, received by the Company from its subsidiaries, financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by the Company's board of directors.\nDiscussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to disclosing financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company's earnings release contains non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effects of all forms of share-based compensation, as well as amortization of intangible assets in relation to the acquisition of Gold Master. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest GAAP measures is set forth in the table captioned \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" below.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The financial results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP and reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results should be carefully evaluated. The non-GAAP financial measure used by the Company may be prepared differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nWhen evaluating the Company's operating performance in the periods presented, management reviewed the non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS results reflecting adjustments to exclude the impact of share-based compensation as well as amortization of intangible assets in relation to the acquisition of Gold Master to supplement U.S. GAAP financial data. As such, the Company believes that the presentation of the non-GAAP net income and the diluted non-GAAP income per ADS provides important supplemental information to investors regarding financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations in a manner consistent with that used by management. Pursuant to U.S. GAAP, the Company recognized significant amounts of expenses for the restricted shares and share options, as well as amortization of intangible assets in relation to the acquisition of Gold Master in the periods presented. The Company utilized the non-GAAP financial results to make financial results comparable period to period and to better understand its historical business operations.\nCurrency Conversion\nThis announcement contains translations of certain Renminbi amounts into U.S. dollars at specified rates solely for the convenience of readers.
