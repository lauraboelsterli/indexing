    "text": "All financial figures are in Canadian dollars\nCALGARY, Alberta, March 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gibson Energy Inc. (“Gibson” or the “Company”), (TSX:GEI), announced today its operating and financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Highlights:\nInfrastructure segment profit of $56 million in the fourth quarter contributed to 2017 full year performance of $237 million, a 19% increase over full year 2016. The fourth quarter of 2017 was negatively impacted by $7 million from one-time revenue adjustments and recognition of environmental remediation costs at Hardisty\nSegment profit from continuing operations in 2017 of $310 million, a 17% increase from 2016, was driven by an increased contribution from each segment\nNet loss from continuing operations decreased by 35% in 2017 to $116 million compared to a net loss of $178 million in 2016\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations (1) increased by 14% to $278 million in 2017 compared to $244 million in 2016\nDistributable cash flow from combined operations (2) increased by 39% to $184 million in 2017, including $65 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $132 million in 2016 and $48 million in the fourth quarter of 2016\nStrategic Developments and Highlights:\nRefocused the asset portfolio towards oil infrastructure through the sale of Industrial Propane for $433 million on March 1, 2017 and announced intention to sell U.S. Environmental Services on August 1, 2017\nInvested $157 million of growth capital in 2017, including nearly 95% within the Infrastructure segment primarily to advance the development of the 800,000 barrel expansion in Edmonton, which entered service on January 3, 2018, as well as the construction of 1.1 million barrels of new tankage at the Hardisty Terminal that was sanctioned on September 11, 2017 and is expected to be in-service in the third quarter of 2019\nInitiated a corporate reorganization through the year, including the appointment of Steve Spaulding as the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer effective June 19, 2017 and the elimination of certain executive and management positions, incurring one-time reorganization and executive costs of $19 million\nIssued $600 million of 5.25% Senior Unsecured Notes due July 15, 2024 and redeemed the US$550 million 6.75% Notes due July 15, 2021 and the $250 million 7.00% Notes due July 2020, extending the company’s debt maturity profile and meaningfully reducing interest costs\n“Gibson delivered strong financial and operational results in 2017 while continuing to advance our infrastructure focused strategy by divesting of the Industrial Propane business and initiating the process to sell U.S. Environmental Services,” said Steve Spaulding, President and Chief Executive Officer. “As we continue to better position the company for future growth and high-quality cash flows, we transitioned to a flatter, commercially-focused organizational structure, which in concert with the refinancing of our long-term debt, has also meaningfully improved our cost structure. In 2018, we will continue our strategic momentum by divesting of our remaining non-core businesses in a structured, timely manner and expect to announce the sale of U.S. Environmental Services by the end of the first quarter. Additionally, we will look to secure the incremental growth opportunities required to reach our ~10% distributable cash flow per share growth target over the longer term, such as the recently announced Viking Pipeline Project.”\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations is defined in Gibson’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”). See MD&A section “Results of Continuing Operations ” for segment profit from continuing operations discussion, which is the most closely related additional GAAP measure and disclosed in note 1 of the consolidated financial statements.\n(2) Distributable cash flow from combined operations is defined in Gibson’s MD&A. See MD&A sections “Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Results of Discontinued Operations” for cash flow from operations discussion, which is the most closely related GAAP measure.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis and Financial Statements\nThe 2017 fourth quarter and year-end MD&A and audited consolidated financial statements provide a detailed explanation of Gibson’s operating results for the three months and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the three months and fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.

No assurance can be given that these expectations will prove to be correct and such included in this news release should not be unduly relied upon. These statements speak only as of the date of this news release. In addition, this news release may contain and forward-looking information attributed to third party industry sources. The Company does not undertake any obligations to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements except as required by securities law.

Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and Distributable cash flow (“DCF”) from combined operations are not a measure recognized under IFRS and does not have standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other entities. Management considers these to be important supplemental measures of the Company’s performance and believes these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in industries with similar capital structures. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations and Distributable cash flow are used to assess the level of cash flow generated and to evaluate the adequacy of internally generated cash flow to fund dividends. Additional information about reconciliation of historical distributable cash flow and Adjusted EBITDA to its most closely related IFRS measure, cash flow from operating activities and segment profit, respectively, can be found in our MD&A available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on our website at www.gibsonenergy.com .\nFor further information, please contact:\nMark Chyc-Cies\nVice President, Investor Relations\nPhone: (403) 776-3146\nEmail: mark.chyccies@gibsonenergy.com\nSelected Financial Information\nThree months ended December 31 Year ended December 31 2017 2016 3 2017 2016 3 2015 3 Continuing operations Revenue $ 1,766,887 $ 1,414,187 $ 6,100,839 $ 4,594,181 $ 5,405,311 Segment profit 85,227 87,634 310,236 263,646 377,416 Net loss (91,787 ) (50,597 ) (115,715 ) (178,167 ) (295,374 ) Basic and diluted loss per share (0.64 ) (0.36 ) (0.81 ) (1.31 ) (2.35 ) Adjusted EBITDA 1,2 82,271 83,927 277,635 244,092 344,591 Distributable cash flow 1,2 48,465 42,725 165,031 101,940 200,990 Dividends declared 47,257 46,772 188,470 181,994 161,002 Cash flow from operating activities 45,314 44,152 204,970 175,482 399,117 Growth capital expenditures $ 59,045 $ 34,769 $ 157,123 $ 202,984 $ 343,766 Combined operations 1 Adjusted EBITDA 1,2 82,271 97,219 291,272 278,106 386,284 Distributable cash flow 1,2 $ 65,170 $ 47,614 $ 183,594 $ 131,644 $ 226,297 Consolidated balance sheets\nAs at December 31 2017 2016 2015 Total assets $ 2,964,434 $ 3,261,347 $ 3,282,986 Total non-current liabilities $ 1,498,900 $ 1,639,045 $ 1,606,425 Last Twelve Months - As at December 31 2017 2016 2015 Debt ratios 4 Total and senior debt leverage ratio 4.0 4.4 3.2 Interest coverage ratio 3.7 3.0 4.6",
