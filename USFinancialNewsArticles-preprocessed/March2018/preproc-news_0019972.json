Actual results in future periods may those currently expected or desired because of a number of risks and uncertainties that are beyond the control of Korn Ferry.

For a detailed description of risks and uncertainties that could cause differences, please refer to Korn Ferry's periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Korn Ferry disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains financial information calculated other than in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\"). In particular, it includes:\nadjusted net income attributable to Korn/Ferry International, adjusted to exclude the tax impact associated with the Tax Act, restructuring (recoveries) charges, net, integration/acquisition costs and write-off of debt issuance costs and to include the deferred revenue adjustment related to the Legacy Hay acquisition, net of income tax effect; adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share, adjusted to exclude the tax impact associated with the Tax Act, restructuring (recoveries) charges, net, integration/acquisition costs and write-off of debt issuance costs and to include the deferred revenue adjustment related to the Legacy Hay acquisition, net of income tax effect; and in the case of the outlook section, also adjusted for tax rate impact; constant currency (calculated using a quarterly average) amounts that represent the outcome that would have resulted had exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior year period; EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and EBITDA margin; Adjusted EBITDA, which is EBITDA further adjusted to exclude restructuring (recoveries) charges, net and integration/acquisition costs and to include the deferred revenue adjustment related to the Legacy Hay acquisition and Adjusted EBITDA margin; and adjusted fee revenue, which includes revenue that Hay Group would have realized over the ensuing year after acquisition if not for business combination accounting that requires a company to record the acquisition balance sheet at fair value and write-off deferred revenue where no future services are required to be performed to earn that revenue.\nThis non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for financial information determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.\nManagement believes the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures in this press release provides meaningful supplemental information regarding Korn Ferry's performance by excluding certain charges and other items that may not be indicative of Korn Ferry's ongoing operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures are performance measures and are not indicative of the liquidity of Korn Ferry. These charges represent 1) the tax impact associated with the Tax Act, 2) costs we incurred to acquire and integrate the Legacy Hay acquisition, 3) charges we incurred to restructure the combined company due to the acquisition of Legacy Hay, 4) debt issuance costs written-off upon replacement of our credit facility and 5) revenue that Hay Group would have realized if not for business combination accounting that requires a company to record the acquisition balance sheet at fair value and write-off deferred revenue where no future services are required to be performed to earn that revenue. As such, reported fee revenue can make fee revenue and operating results appear to fluctuate more than they would if business combination accounting did not require deferred revenue to be written off. Adjusted fee revenue is not a measure that substitutes an individually tailored revenue recognition or measurement method for those of GAAP, rather, it is an adjustment for a short period of time that will provide better comparability in the current and future periods. Management believes the presentation of adjusted fee revenue assists management in its evaluation of ongoing operations and provides useful information to investors because it allows investors to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company's operating results, to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be distorted by write-offs required under business combination accounting and to perform related trend analysis, and provides a higher degree of transparency of information used by management in its evaluation of Korn Ferry's ongoing operations and financial and operational decision-making. Management no longer has adjusted fee revenue after Q1 FY'17. The use of non-GAAP financial measures facilitates comparisons to Korn Ferry's historical performance. Korn Ferry includes non-GAAP financial measures because management believes they are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its evaluation of Korn Ferry's ongoing operations and financial and operational decision-making. Management further believes that EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by investors and other interested parties to measure operating performance among companies with different capital structures, effective tax rates and tax attributes and capitalized asset values, all of which can vary substantially from company to company. In the case of constant currency amounts, management believes the presentation of such information provides useful supplemental information regarding Korn Ferry's performance as excluding the impact of exchange rate changes on Korn Ferry's financial performance allows investors to make more meaningful period-to-period comparisons of the Company's operating results, to better identify operating trends that may otherwise be masked or distorted by exchange rate changes and to perform related trend analysis, and provides a higher degree of transparency of information used by management in its evaluation of Korn Ferry's ongoing operations and financial and operational decision-making.\n[Tables attached]\nKORN FERRY AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n(in thousands, except
