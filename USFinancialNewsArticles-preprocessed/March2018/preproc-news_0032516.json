    "text": "March 16, 2018 / 1:49 PM / Updated 36 minutes ago Goldman Sachs reports mean gender pay gap of 55.5 percent Reuters Staff 1 Min Read LONDON, March 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs on Friday reported a mean gender pay gap in Britain for its international business of 55.5 percent and a mean bonus gap for that unit of 72.2 percent. The bank said the gap reflected the fact that there were more men than women in senior positions at the firm. It also reported a mean gender pay gap of 16.1 percent and a mean bonus gap of 32.5 percent in Goldman Sachs (UK) SVC Limited, which it said employs around 1,600 individuals from non-revenue divisions. The remainder of its UK employees are employed in its international business. Reporting by Emma Rumney; editing by Carolyn Cohn",
