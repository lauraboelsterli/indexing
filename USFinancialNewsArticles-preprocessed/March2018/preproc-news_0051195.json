    "text": "The integration of Amazon and Whole Foods seems to becoming more closely knit.\nA Whole Foods store in Austin, Texas has reportedly been testing signs promoting a 10% discount for Amazon Prime members.\nThe signs were only hung for a short period of time and Amazon did not immediately reply to a request for comment on whether it was planning to make this a national offer.\nOne of the banners told Prime members “blue signs mean special deals just for you, yes you.” Another said Prime “members save an extra 10% on hundreds of sale prices.”\nAmazon has been ramping up the promotions for Prime members and Whole Foods customers this year. In February, the company announced plans to offer free two-hour delivery on Whole Foods goods in some locations. And after acquiring Whole Foods in August, the company immediately cut prices on several items.\nThe company has also installed Amazon.com lockers in some stores, letting shoppers instantly pick up certain items. Those have brought more customers into the grocery chain for quick trips as well.",
