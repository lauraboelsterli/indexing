    "text": "TOKYO, March 30 (Reuters) - Nomura Holdings Inc said on Friday it would invest about 1.6 billion yen ($15 million) in a Japanese fintech firm that offers financial robo-advisory services, marking its latest attempt to woo young clients.\nNomura Asset Management, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nomura Holdings, would hold a majority stake in 8 Securities, which provides robo-advisory services through mobile apps using exchange-traded funds, Nomura said in a statement.\nThe fintech firm and Nomura Asset Management are developing an app that would offer the Nomura subsidiary’s index funds, the statement added.\nNomura also said it would hold a minority stake and invest around 1.1 billion yen in 8 Limited, the Hong Kong-based parent company of 8 Securities.\nApart from mobile app robo-advisory services, 8 Limited also provides online brokerage services in Hong Kong.\nNomura, Japan’s largest brokerage and investment banking group, has been aiming to tap a new generation of customers as its client base ages.\nNomura and messaging app LINE Corp said this week they were looking to set up a joint venture that would offer mobile and online brokerage services and investment advice.\nLast year, the president of its core Nomura Securities subsidiary said it planned to leverage its access to about 1.6 million members of employee stock ownership plans, for many of whom it is an administrator, to recruit younger clients.
