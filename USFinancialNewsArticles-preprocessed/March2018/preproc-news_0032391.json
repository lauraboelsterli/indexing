    "text": "-Posted 2017 Total Revenues of $226.9 Million-\n-Reported 2017 Broadband Revenue Growth of 6.3%-\nANCHORAGE, Alaska--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Alaska Communications Systems Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: ALSK) today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended Dec. 31, 2017.\n“The results for 2017 reflect year over year stability in our top-line performance. Revenue stability combined with tight management of operating and capital expenditures enabled us to generate $8.1 million in free cash flow, which was above our guidance for the year.\nOur full year revenue performance was driven by growth in broadband, in particular by Wholesale broadband including wireless carrier backhaul and federal end-user demand, moderated by lower than expected growth from our health care vertical. While our full year revenue was flat year over year, our fourth quarter 2017 revenue declined due to the cumulative impact of price compression for the Rural Health Care 2017-2018 funding year for the period July 1 through December 31, 2017. 2017 Adjusted EBITDA, which includes a $2.6 million bad debt expense related to Rural Health Care customers, was $56.7 million, meeting annual guidance. Lastly, about 59% of our capital expenditures were directed toward success-based investments providing a foundation for future growth.\nEntering 2018, we expect our Enterprise & Carrier business to continue to drive our top-line performance as we benefit from our increasing wireless backhaul business and additional opportunities from federal and energy sector investments in Alaska. Further the recent turn up of arctic fiber capacity by our partner, Quintillion Networks, opens several Arctic markets for us further driving our market opportunity. We are strengthening our mass market business serving residential and small businesses by investing in fiber-fed WiFi, Fixed Wireless technologies and an increasingly online customer interaction model, while positioning to meet our CAF II obligations in a cost-effective manner.\nLooking ahead, we remain focused on operating a quality business that enables us to leverage the significant opportunities in the market. In parallel, we continue to evaluate our current long-term business plan against a broad range of strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value. I look forward to reporting progress on all fronts over the upcoming months and quarters,” said Anand Vadapalli, Alaska Communications president and CEO.\nRevenue Highlights\nTotal revenue: Revenue was $54.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $57.8 in the fourth quarter of 2016.

The company operates a highly reliable, advanced statewide data network with the latest technology and the most diverse undersea fiber optic system connecting Alaska to the contiguous U.S. For more information, visit www.alaskacommunications.com or www.alsk.com .\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn an effort to provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have provided certain non-GAAP financial information, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Net Debt. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates the effects of period to period changes in costs that are not directly attributable to the underlying performance of the Company’s business operations and is used by Management and the Company’s Board of Directors to evaluate current operating financial performance, analyze and evaluate strategic and operational decisions and better evaluate comparability between periods. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP liquidity measured used by Management and the Company’s Board of Directors to assess the Company’s ability to generate cash and plan for future operating and capital actions. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are common measures utilized by our peers (other telecommunications companies) and we believe they provide useful information to investors and analysts about the Company’s operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Net Debt provides Management and the Company’s Board of Directors with a measure of the Company’s current leverage position. The definition of these non-GAAP measures is provided on Schedules 4, 6 and 9 to this press release. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow should not be considered a substitute for Net Income, Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities and other measures of financial performance recorded in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to our nearest GAAP measures can be found in the tables in this release and on our website in the investment data section. Other companies may not calculate non-GAAP measures in the same manner as Alaska Communications. The Company does not provide reconciliations of guidance for Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income, and Adjusted Free Cash Flow to Net Cash from Operating Activities, in reliance on the unreasonable efforts exception provided under Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B) of Regulation S-K. The Company does not forecast certain items required to develop the comparable GAAP financial measures. These items are charges and benefits for uncollectible accounts, certain other non-cash expenses, unusual items typically excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, and changes in operating assets and liabilities (generally the most significant of these items, representing cash outflows of $15.3 million for 2017).\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes certain \"forward-looking statements,\" as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on management's beliefs as well as on a number of assumptions concerning future events made using information currently available to management. Such statements include all statements regarding our review of our current long-term business plan against a broad range of alternatives that have the potential to enhance shareholder value, the timing of such review, and the possible outcomes of such review and our current and projected financial and operating performance and all guidance related thereto. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which are not a guarantee of performance and are subject to a number of uncertainties and other factors, many of which are outside the Company’s control. Such factors include, without limitation, Federal and Alaska Universal Service Fund changes including Rural Health Care Program funding limitations, adverse economic conditions, expectations regarding capital allocation and cost management, the effects of competition in our markets, unforeseen challenges when entering new markets, our relatively small size compared with our competitors, the Company’s ability to compete, manage, integrate, market, maintain, and attract sufficient customers for its products and services, adverse changes in labor matters, including workforce levels, our ability to service our debt and refinance as required, labor negotiations, including renegotiating our collective bargaining agreement, employee benefit costs, our ability to control other operating costs, disruption of our supplier’s provisioning of critical products or services, the impact of natural or man-made disasters, changes in Company's relationships with large customers, unforeseen changes in public policies, regulatory changes, changes in technology and standards, risks, disruption, costs and uncertainty caused by or related to the actions of activist shareholders, including that if individuals are elected to our Board with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create value for our shareholders and perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of potential changes to the composition of our Board may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business, instability or a lack of continuity which may be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, our internal control over financial reporting, and changes in accounting standards or policies, which could affect reported financial results. For further information regarding risks and uncertainties associated with the Company’s business, please refer to the Company's SEC filings, including, but not limited to, the sections entitled \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are not GAAP measures and should not be considered a substitute for net income, net cash provided by operating activities, or net cash provided or used. Adjusted EBITDA as computed above is not consistent with the definition of Consolidated EBITDA referenced in our 2017 Senior Credit Agreement and 2015 Senior Credit Agreements, and other companies may not calculate Non-GAAP measures in the same manner we do. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest, loss on extinguishment of debt, depreciation and amortization, gain or loss on asset purchases or disposals, income taxes, stock-based compensation, net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest and expenses under the Company’s long term cash incentive plan (“LTCI”). LTCI expenses are considered part of an interim compensation structure, which ended in 2016, to mitigate the dilutive impact of additional share issuances for executive compensation.\nSchedule 5 ALASKA COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS GROUP, INC.

Onetime events, seasonality of capital spend and the timing of interest payments may result in negative Adjusted Free Cash Flow in one or more quarters. NonGAAP Measures:\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP liquidity measure and is defined as Adjusted EBITDA, less recurring operating cash requirements which include capital expenditures, cash income taxes refunded or paid, cash interest paid, amortization of GCI capacity revenue, and cash receipts and payments associated with the purchase of the North Slope fiber network and establishment of our joint venture with QHL. Amortization of deferred revenue associated with our interconnection agreement with GCI is excluded from Adjusted Free Cash Flow because no cash was received by the Company in connection with this agreement. Amortization of all other deferred revenue, including that associated with other IRU capacity arrangements, is included in Adjusted Free Cash Flow because cash was received by the Company, typically at contract inception, and is being amortized to revenue over the term of the relevant agreement.\nSee Schedule 3 for Net cash provided by operating activities, Net cash used by investing activities, and Net cash used by financing activities. See Schedule 5 for the reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Adjusted Free Cash Flow.\nSchedule 7 ALASKA COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS GROUP, INC.
