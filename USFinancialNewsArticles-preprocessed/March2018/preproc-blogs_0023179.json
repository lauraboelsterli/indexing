    "text": "7:09 PM ET Fri, 9 March 2018 | 05:21 \nIt's time to hit the sell button on Facebook , according to one technician. \nShares of the social media giant are up nearly 34 percent in the past year, now trading less than 1 percent away from its all-time highs. But Carter Worth, head of technical analysis at Cornerstone Macro, says there's trouble brewing in the charts. \nWorth first points to a growing divergence between Facebook and the NYSE Fang + Index , which also includes names such as Twitter and NVIDIA . \n\"What we have of course is a great correlation that has started to not be the case,\" Worth said Friday on CNBC's \" Options Action .\" \"Often after a great runup, a fade or stall foreshadows more trouble.\" \nFacebook is the worst-performing FANG stock year to date. Its shares have risen 5 percent, while Amazon and Netflix shares have rallied 37 percent and 67 percent, respectively. \nWorth also noted Facebook's recent underperformance in the last four months. While the S&P 500 has risen 5 percent in that time, Facebook has gained just over 4 percent. \nFurthermore, Worth pointed to Facebook's weakness relative to the overall S&P 500 tech sector. \n\"Its relative performance to the other choices one could have made is down,\" Worth explained, \"That's not great. [It's] not a good setup.\" On Monday, both the Nasdaq and the S&P technology ETF, the XLK , hit new all-time highs. \nA closer look at Facebook's trend line shows the stock slipping below its uptrend channel. Despite a retesting of those levels, Worth cautions that when stocks \"hit the head\" like this, it's often an indicator of more bearish activity ahead. \n\"I'm a seller of Facebook here,\" Worth advised. \"If you're long and got great gains, take your money off the table.\" \nFacebook shares were trading slightly higher, at $185.83 on Monday afternoon.",
