FILE PHOTO: A guard walks past the NSE (National Stock Exchange) building in Mumbai, February 9, 2018. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/File Photo NSE, as the bourse is known, had originally planned to go public in 2017 but it has been delayed due to an investigation by the market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on whether the exchange’s employees had provided unfair trading access to select brokers. NSE said in a statement that the SEBI returned its application proposing a settlement as the probe was still ongoing, but allowed it to submit it again after the investigations are completed. NSE intends to file the settlement application “in due course”, it added. Reporting by Abhirup Roy; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu",
