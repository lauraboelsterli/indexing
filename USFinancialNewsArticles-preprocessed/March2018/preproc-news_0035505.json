    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nFuture Farm Technologies Inc. (the \"Company\" or \"Future Farm\") (CSE: FFT) (OTCQX: FFRMF) is pleased to announce that it has closed on the previously announced investment in BCWC, LLC (\"BCWC\"), formerly known as Bristol County Wellness Center, Inc. BCWC was recently awarded a special permit from the City of Attleboro and a provisional license from the Department of Public Health to build and operate a 24,700-sq. ft. Registered Marijuana Dispensary (\"RMD\") that will grow and sell medical marijuana. This vertically integrated license allows BCWC to build out its facility and engage in cannabis cultivation, processing and retailing. BCWC plans to add two additional retail outlets when suitable locations are identified and required approvals are obtained.\nMr. William Gildea, CEO of Future Farm, comments, \"We are pleased to be working with the experienced team at BCWC and thrilled about the potential to operate in Massachusetts since it further positions our Company for revenue growth in 2018.\" He continues, \"This transaction allows us to operate in a state that has approved, but not yet implemented, the adult use of cannabis, which positions us as one of the first movers in the state.\" In Massachusetts, licensed RMDs and applicants with provisional licenses (such as BCWC) applying for an adult use license are eligible for prioritized application review by the state.\nThe timetable calls for construction to begin in the next thirty days, and revenue to begin in the fourth quarter of 2018. BCWC is provisionally licensed to cultivate cannabis with up to 300 lights, process and extract oil to make edibles, and sell through up to three medical dispensary locations. BCWC may also sell up to 30% of its cannabis to other dispensaries. ArcView Market Research and New Frontier Research each estimate the adult use recreational market in Massachusetts to have annual sales in excess of $1 billion by 2020.\nDerek Ross, BCWC's Manager, comments, \"Unlike other states such as Colorado, Washington or California, where adult cannabis use is legal, Massachusetts is located within driving distance to many of the most densely populated states in the U.S. We anticipate that our facility, which will be conveniently located 1.5 miles from Exit 1 on I-95, will contribute to an increase in the Massachusetts cannabis tourism industry, providing state revenue, tax dollars, and job growth.\"\nFuture Farm made its investment by loaning BCWC $5,003,100 under a Secured Convertible Promissory Note. That Note will convert automatically into a 51% ownership interest in BCWC on the date on which BCWC receives its RMD Certificate from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. If the Note does not convert, it is due and payable in full on May 1, 2019. In addition, Future Farm has entered into consulting contracts with each of the owners of BCWC for those individuals to advise Future Farm on the development of the BCWC facilities and business. The aggregate consideration for the consulting services to be provided by all of the individuals is the issuance of 2,925,514 Common Shares of Future Farm.\nFor further information, contact William Gildea, Director, at (888)387-3761\nOn behalf of the Board,\nFuture Farm Technologies Inc.\nWilliam Gildea, Chairman & CEO\nAbout Future Farm\nFuture Farm Technologies Inc. is a Canadian company with projects throughout North America including California, Florida and Maryland. The Company's business model includes developing and acquiring technologies that will position it as a leader in the evolution of Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) for the global production of various types of plants, with a focus on cannabis. Future Farm provides scalable, indoor CEA systems that utilize minimal land, water and energy regardless of climate, location or time of year and are customized to grow an abundance of crops close to consumers, therefore minimizing food miles and its impact to the environment. The Company holds an exclusive, worldwide license to use a patented vertical farming technology that, when compared to traditional plant production methods, generates yields up to 10 times greater per square foot of land. The contained system provides many other benefits including 90% less water, fertilizer and land used, less travel costs, seed to sale security, scalability, consistency due to year-round production, cost control, product safety and purity by eliminating environmental variability. The Company also utilizes a leading cannabis oil extraction technology, which enables the Company to process 20lbs/hour of cannabis plant to yield approximately 908 grams/hour of oil.\nThe Company is also in the business of designing and distributing LED lighting solutions utilizing the COB and MCOB technology. The Company is focused on delivering cost efficient lighting to North America via advanced e-commerce sites the Company owns and operates. LEDCanada.com , which caters to B2B customers, is a supplier of the newest and highest demand LED solutions. The Company also owns and operates COBGrowlights.com , which caters to both large and small agriculture green houses and controlled cultivation centers.\nNeither the Canadian Securities Exchange nor its Market Regulator (as that term is defined in the policies of the Canadian Securities Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.
