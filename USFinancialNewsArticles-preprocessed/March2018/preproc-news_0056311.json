(NYSE:MDLY) today reported its financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nHighlights\nFee earning assets under management were $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2017\nTotal assets under management were $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2017\nU.S. GAAP net income (loss) per share attributable to Medley Management Inc. was $(0.11) for Q4 2017 and $0.07 for the year ended December 31, 2017\nCore Net Income Per Share was $0.05 for Q4 2017 and $0.33 for the year ended December 31, 2017\nResults of Operations for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017\nTotal revenues were $18.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $18.3 million for the same period in 2016.\nTotal expenses from operations were $13.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $9.2 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was due primarily to an increase in compensation and benefits, professional fees and expenses of our consolidated fund.\nTotal other expense, net was $1.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.6 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was due primarily to a decrease in equity income from our investments due to unrealized losses, partly offset by an increase in dividend income.\nNet income attributable to Medley Management Inc. and non-controlling interests in Medley LLC was $0.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $5.3 million for the same period in 2016. Medley Management Inc.’s net loss per share was $0.11 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to net income per share of $0.07 for the same period in 2016.\nPre-Tax Core Net Income was $2.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $7.4 million for the same period in 2016.

Core EBITDA was $5.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $9.8 million for the same period in 2016.\nResults of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nTotal revenues were $65.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $76.0 million in 2016. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in performance and incentive fees, partly offset by an increase in other revenue and fees.\nTotal expenses from operations were $39.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $56.0 million in 2016. The decrease was due primarily to a reduction in expenses associated with our expense support agreement with SIC and a reduction in compensation and benefits expense, partly offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses.\nTotal other expense, net was $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $9.0 million in 2016. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in expense associated with our revenue share payable and an increase in dividend income, partly offset by an increase in interest expense.\nNet income attributable to Medley Management Inc. and non-controlling interests in Medley LLC was $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $7.4 million in 2016. Medley Management Inc.’s net income per share was $0.07 for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net income per share of $0.02 in 2016.\nPre-Tax Core Net Income was $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $29.0 million in 2016.

Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those described from time to time in filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including those described in the section “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017. Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statement made herein. All forward-looking statements made herein speak only as of the date of this press release.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures in this press release. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP is contained in the tables attached hereto.\nNon-GAAP measures used by management include Pre-Tax Core Net Income, Core Net Income, Core EBITDA, Core Net Income Per Share and Core Net Income Margin. Management believes that these measures provide analysts, investors and management with helpful information regarding our underlying operating performance and our business, as they remove the impact of items management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance. These non-GAAP measures are also used by management for planning purposes, including the preparation of internal budgets; and for evaluating the effectiveness of operational strategies. Additionally, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide another tool for investors to use in comparing our results with other companies in our industry, many of whom use similar non-GAAP measures. There are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as compared to the use of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure and these measures supplement and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations discussed below. Furthermore, such measures may be inconsistent with measures presented by other companies.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer for any Medley fund.\nAvailable Information\nMedley Management Inc.’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, press releases, earnings releases and other financial information are available at www.mdly.com .\n(1) Medley Management Inc. is the parent company of Medley LLC and several registered investment advisors (collectively, \"Medley”).
