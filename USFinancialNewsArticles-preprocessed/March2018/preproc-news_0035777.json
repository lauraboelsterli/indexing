    "text": "BOULDER, Colo., March 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ArcherDX, Inc., the leader in NGS-based gene fusion detection assays, announced today that it has closed a $35 million Series A Preferred financing, which was co-led by Boulder Ventures, Ltd. and PBM Capital Group, LLC. Longwood Fund and Peierls Foundation also participated in the Series A financing as new investors. Kyle Lefkoff of Boulder Ventures has joined the ArcherDX Board of Directors.\nThe capital comes after a year of record growth for the company and penetration into liquid biopsy, immune sequencing, and companion diagnostic (CDx) markets. The company will use the funding to support the rapid commercial growth of its targeted sequencing assays, including expanding its domestic salesforce, increasing its international commercial operations, scaling its oncology-focused CDx co-development program and continuing to invest in its in vitro diagnostic (IVD) pipeline.\nDr. Jason Myers, CEO and Co-founder of ArcherDX, said in a statement, \"We've been very successful in developing the technology, establishing scalable processes and driving rapid revenue growth.
