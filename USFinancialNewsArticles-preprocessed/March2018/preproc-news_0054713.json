    "text": "Fourth Quarter net income of $84 million, compared to a net loss of $152 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year; normalized net income of $20 million compared to $2 million Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDAR of $528 million, compared to $564 million in the prior year Fourth quarter retail sales increased 2.1% to $4.7 billion; comparable sales declined by 2.4% Saks Fifth Avenue comparable sales increased 2.1%, growing for the third consecutive quarter; Hudson’s Bay extends streak of positive comparable sales for 30th consecutive quarter Progress continues on the Transformation Plan and initiatives to capitalize on valuable real estate portfolio Ended fiscal year with $1.7 billion of liquidity, lower debt, and agreement to sell Lord & Taylor flagship building which will further enhance liquidity\nTORONTO & NEW YORK & COLOGNE, Germany--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- HBC (TSX: HBC) today announced its financial results for the fourteen and fifty-three week periods ended February 3, 2018. Unless otherwise indicated, all amounts are expressed in Canadian dollars. Certain metrics, including those expressed on an adjusted, normalized, comparable and/or constant currency basis, are non-IFRS financial measures. For more information please refer to the “Supplemental Information” section of this press release and the reconciliation tables below.\n“While we are not pleased with our recent performance, we continue to capitalize on the value of our real estate portfolio and are taking action to improve our operating results. Our valuable real estate assets provide HBC with a solid financial base, and the recent agreement to sell the Lord & Taylor flagship building further demonstrates our ability to monetize these assets and enhance liquidity. We are also working to better position our retail operations, and have made several key leadership appointments which we believe will help drive business performance. I am confident that the addition of Helena Foulkes and her transformational leadership will invigorate HBC with a fresh perspective as we position ourselves for the future. I would like to thank all of our associates for their hard work and dedication during a challenging time. Together, we are determined to grow sales and increase margins while evaluating all opportunities to create shareholder value,” stated Richard Baker, HBC’s Governor and Executive Chairman.\nHelena Foulkes, HBC's Chief Executive Officer, added, “HBC is a unique company with iconic banners and a storied history. I've spent the past six weeks visiting our stores and offices around the world, and it is clear to me that there is significant opportunity to build upon our solid foundation to realize the full potential of our business. In the coming weeks, I will continue to listen and learn from our associates and customers as I work with the leadership team to heighten accountability for driving business results, improve our culture, and develop a long-term strategic plan.”\nFourth Quarter Summary\nAll comparative figures below are for the fourteen week period ended February 3, 2018 compared to the thirteen week period ended January 28, 2017. DSG refers, collectively, to the Hudson’s Bay, Lord & Taylor and Home Outfitters banners. HBC Europe refers, collectively, to the GALERIA Kaufhof, Galeria INNO, Hudson’s Bay Netherlands and Saks Fifth Avenue OFF 5TH Europe banners. HBC Off Price refers, collectively, to the Saks Fifth Avenue OFF 5TH (“Saks OFF 5TH”) and Gilt banners. All references to “comparable sales” are made on a constant currency basis. Where applicable, prior year foreign exchange rates are applied to both current year and prior year comparable sales. See “Non-IFRS Measures”\nRetail sales were $4,695 million, an increase of $95 million, or 2.1%, from the prior year. Total sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 reflect a 14th week of sales, whereas comparable sales are on the same 13-week basis as Fiscal 2016. This additional week of sales and the opening of new stores during the year contributed approximately $267 million in sales. This was partially offset by lower comparable sales of $110 million, the impact of closed stores, and a negative foreign exchange impact on the translation to Canadian dollars.\nComparable sales at Saks Fifth Avenue grew for the third consecutive quarter, increasing by 2.1%. Comparable sales at Saks Fifth Avenue have now been positive for four of the last five quarters, while comparable sales at Hudson’s Bay grew for the 30th consecutive quarter. Comparable sales declined by 2.6% at DSG, 3.4% at HBC Europe, and 7.6% at HBC Off Price. Consolidated comparable sales trends improved slightly from the third quarter, decreasing by 2.4%. Comparable sales during the quarter were impacted by operational challenges resulting from the Company’s Transformation Plan and lower traffic at Lord & Taylor, HBC Off Price, and Galeria Kaufhof. Comparable digital sales increased by 2.8%, or by 9.0% excluding Gilt.\nFor HBC overall, gross profit 1 as a percentage of retail sales was 39.7%, a decline of 50 basis points compared to the prior year. This decrease was driven primarily by lower margins at HBC Europe and HBC Off Price, partially offset by higher margins at Saks Fifth Avenue.\nSG&A expenses were $1,690 million compared to $1,669 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by an extra week of operating expenses, higher rent expense of $33 million primarily related to new store openings, increased restructuring charges of $31 million, and additional costs related to new stores opened during the year. These increases were partially offset by a net decrease in impairment charges of $79 million, $57 million in savings from the Transformation Plan, and a reduction in other non-recurring and one-time charges. Current quarter expenses include a non-cash impairment charge of $63 million related to the Gilt trade name.\nAdjusted SG&A 1 expenses, which exclude certain non-cash items and normalizing adjustments consistent with the Company’s other non-IFRS metrics, were $1,525 million or 32.5% of retail sales, compared to $1,442 million or 31.3% in the prior year. In addition to the extra week of operations, the increase in Adjusted SG&A dollars was driven primarily by an increase in rent expense and other costs related to new store openings. These increases were partially offset by savings from the Company’s Transformation Plan as well as a small foreign exchange rate benefit. The increase in Adjusted SG&A 1 dollars combined with the impacts associated with lower comparable sales resulted in an increased Adjusted SG&A 1 expense rate.\nAdjusted EBITDAR 1 was $528 million, a decrease of $36 million compared to the prior year. The decline in Adjusted EBITDAR 1 can primarily be attributed to an increase in non-rent Adjusted SG&A 1 expenses partially offset by higher gross profit dollars.\nDuring the fourth quarter the Company recognized amortization credits of approximately $20 million related to the closure of certain stores whose leases had been previously acquired. In the prior year, the Company finalized its purchase price allocation for Gilt, which resulted in a cumulative amortization expense adjustment of approximately $37 million.\nTotal income tax benefit was $154 million, compared to an expense of $21 million in the prior year. This increase in income tax benefit is attributable to a $181 million gain relating to the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities held in the U.S. These liabilities were revalued based on the new corporate tax rates recently implemented as part of the U.S. tax reforms.\nNet earnings were $84 million compared to a net loss $152 million in the prior year. This improvement in earnings is primarily due to a $181 million tax gain resulting from the recent U.S. tax reforms, as well as the reduction in impairment charges and other non-recurring charges, lower depreciation and amortization expenses and higher equity income from the Company’s real estate joint ventures. Normalized net earnings 1 were $20 million compared to $2 million in the prior year, primarily a result of lower depreciation and amortization expenses, reduced impairment expense and higher gross profit dollars, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses.\nNote: 1 These performance metrics have been identified by the Company as Non-IFRS measures. For the relevant definitions and reconciliations, please refer to the “Non-IFRS Measures” and “Supplemental Information” sections, respectively, of this release. Improving Results\nHudson’s Bay and Saks Fifth Avenue continued to see strong performance in 2017. Hudson’s Bay has generated double digit online sales growth while largely maintaining store traffic and sales. This trend is expected to continue as Hudson’s Bay benefits from the closure of Sears Canada, the only other national department store in Canada. Fourth quarter comparable sales growth at Saks Fifth Avenue was the highest in three years, and HBC expects that the luxury sector and Saks Fifth Avenue will continue to grow during Fiscal 2018.\nThere is significant opportunity to improve topline sales at HBC Europe and stabilize operations at HBC’s Off Price businesses. Management is focused on clearly identifying a path towards increased profitability for each of these banners, and will provide additional details on these strategic initiatives in the coming quarters.\nHBC remains on track to achieve its planned cost reductions during Fiscal 2018. HBC’s Transformation Plan is expected to generate annual savings of $350 million by the end of Fiscal 2018, which will mostly offset increased expenses associated with previously committed new store openings and stores opened during the back half of Fiscal 2017, as well as other operating activities. The Company is also committed to operating as efficiently as possible by reducing its overall inventory levels and improving working capital. This, combined with the anticipated improvement in results and reduced net capital investments, are expected to significantly improve cash flow from operations and free cash flow in Fiscal 2018.\nInventory\nInventory at the end of the fourth quarter declined by $9 million compared to the prior year. This lower balance at the end of the quarter was driven primarily by lower comparable inventory and foreign exchange rate impacts, partially offset by higher overall inventory at HBC Europe, largely as a result of the expansion of Hudson’s Bay in the Netherlands and Saks OFF 5TH in Germany.\nStore Network\nDuring the fourth quarter, HBC opened one Saks OFF 5TH store in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. The Company closed six Home Outfitters stores in Canada located in Brampton, Ontario; Kanata, Ontario; Mississauga, Ontario; Coquitlam, British Columbia and Regina, Saskatchewan. The Company also closed seven Sportarena stores located in Bonn, Wuppertal, Kassel, Düsseldorf, Freiburg, Osnabrück and Aalen in Germany.\nStore information as at February 3, 2018 Store Count (1) Gross Leasable Area (1) / Square Footage (000s)\nHudson’s Bay 89 15,731 Lord & Taylor 50 6,930 Saks Fifth Avenue 41 5,187 Saks OFF 5TH 129 3,879 Home Outfitters 44 1,529 HBC Europe (2) 130 28,995 Total 483 62,251\n(1) HBC operates one Find @ Lord & Taylor store, one Hudson’s Bay outlet, two Zellers clearance centres and two Lord & Taylor outlets that are excluded from the store count and gross leasable area. (2) Includes ten Hudson’s Bay Netherlands stores and seven Saks OFF 5TH Europe store opened in Germany and the Netherlands. Capital Investments\nCapital investments, net of landlord incentives, during the fourth quarter totaled $114 million, $51 million less than the prior year. In addition to its European expansion, HBC also continued work on its major renovation at the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship store on Fifth Avenue in New York, and performed smaller renovations at various Galeria Kaufhof, Hudson’s Bay, Lord & Taylor and Saks Fifth Avenue stores.\nHBC is dedicated to prudent capital management and, given the current retail environment, is focusing its capital investment program on in-progress and expected high-return projects, as well as its digital business. Management expects total capital investments in Fiscal 2018, net of landlord incentives, to be between $450 million and $500 million, compared to $599 million in Fiscal 2017.\nThe above capital investment expectations reflect exchange rate assumptions of USD:CAD = 1:1.27 and EUR:CAD = 1:1.48 for the remainder of the year. Any variation in these foreign exchange rate assumptions and/or other material assumptions and factors described in the “Forward-Looking Statements” section of this press release could impact the above outlook.\nDebt Summary\nAs at February 3, 2018, HBC had the following outstanding loans and borrowings on its balance sheet (refer to note 13 of the consolidated financial statements for Fiscal 2017):\n(millions of Canadian dollars) Feb 3, 2018 Jan 28, 2017 Global ABL 375 434 U.S. Term Loan B 619 657 Lord & Taylor Mortgage 488 523 Saks Mortgage 1,548 1,642 Other loans 36 7 Total Outstanding Loans and Borrowings 3,066 3,263 During the year, HBC completed multiple transactions to improve liquidity and enhance the Company’s balance sheet, and ended the year with more than $1.7 billion in total liquidity. In conjunction with raising U.S. $500 million of preferred equity, HBC entered into an agreement to sell its Lord and Taylor New York flagship on Fifth Avenue. The close of this sale, combined with efforts to improve cash flow from operations and free cash flow, are expected to further strengthen the Company’s balance sheet and further enhance overall liquidity.\nConference Call to Discuss Results\nManagement will discuss the fourth quarter financial results and other matters during a conference call on March 28, 2018 at 8:30 am EST.\nThe conference call will be accessible by calling the participant operator assisted toll-free dial-in number (800) 535-7056 or international dial-in number (253) 237-1145.
