    "text": "Special Committee Continues to Evaluate George Feldenkreis Proposal\nMIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Perry Ellis International (NASDAQ:PERY) (“Perry Ellis” or the “Company”) today announced the Board of Directors (the “Board”) has extended the window in which the Company must receive proper written notice of the nomination of a director candidate in connection with its 2018 annual meeting of shareholders to 5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on April 12, 2018. The date and location of the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders of the Company has yet to be announced.\nThe Special Committee of the Board is committed to enhancing value for all Perry Ellis shareholders and, with the assistance of independent financial and legal advisors, is continuing to evaluate the previously announced February 6, 2018 proposal from George Feldenkreis to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Perry Ellis not already beneficially owned by Mr. Feldenkreis (the “Proposal”). No decision has been made with respect to the Company's response to the Proposal. There is no assurance the Proposal will result in a definitive offer to purchase the Company's outstanding capital stock or that any definitive agreement will be executed or that the Proposal or any other transaction will be approved or consummated. The Company will not move forward with any transaction unless it is approved by the Special Committee.\nThe aforementioned extension of the deadline for nomination of directors in connection with the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders of the Company is being provided in connection with certain of the so-called “standstill” obligations contained in the non-disclosure agreements negotiated with proponents of the Proposal.\nThe Company does not undertake any obligation to provide any updates with respect to this or any other transaction, except as required by applicable law.\nThe Special Committee has retained Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP and Akerman LLP as its legal counsel and PJ SOLOMON as its financial advisor to assist in its review.\nAbout Perry Ellis International\nPerry Ellis International, Inc. is a leading designer, distributor and licensor of a broad line of high quality men's and women's apparel, accessories and fragrances.
