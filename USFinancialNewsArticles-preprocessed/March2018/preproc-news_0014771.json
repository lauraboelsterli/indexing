    "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, March 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kelt Exploration Ltd. (“Kelt” or the “Company”) (TSX:KEL) has released its financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.

Daily average production in the fourth quarter of 2017 was 11% higher than average production of 22,510 BOE per day in the third quarter of 2017. In addition, Kelt achieved a record high calendar year average production in 2017. Average production for 2017 was 22,130 BOE per day, up 6% from average production of 20,947 BOE per day in 2016 and 2% higher than guidance whereby Kelt’s forecasted target for average production in 2017 was 21,800 BOE per day. Production for 2017 was weighted 42% oil and NGLs and 58% gas.\nKelt’s realized average oil price during the fourth quarter of 2017 was $65.13 per barrel, up 22% from $53.22 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017 and up 12% from $58.23 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2016. The realized average NGLs price during the fourth quarter of 2017 was $29.62 per barrel, up 22% from $24.34 per barrel in the third quarter of 2017 and up 28% from $23.11 per barrel in the corresponding quarter of 2016. Kelt’s realized average gas price during the fourth quarter of 2017 was $2.79 per MCF, up 20% from $2.33 per MCF in the third quarter of 2017 and down 23% from the realized average gas price of $3.62 per MCF in the fourth quarter of the previous year.\nKelt’s operating netback for the fourth quarter of 2017 was reported as $16.18 per BOE and production expense was reported as $11.01 per BOE. Subsequent to the Company’s press release issued on February 8, 2018, Kelt was provided with notice by a third-party operator of a gas plant in the Pouce Coupe/Progress area that the operator had erroneously undercharged Kelt operating expenses related to Kelt gas volumes processed at the gas plant for 2016 and 2017. As a result, Kelt has recorded $5.2 million of additional production expense (of which, $2.3 million related to 2016 expenses) during the fourth quarter of 2017. This resulted in additional production expense of $2.26 per BOE during the quarter. The pro-forma effect of recording the correct amounts in each calendar year is as follows:\n2017 Production Expense 2016 Production Expense As Reported Pro-Forma Actual As Reported Pro-Forma Actual $81.2 million $78.9 million $71.2 million $73.5 million $10.05 per BOE $9.77 per BOE $9.29 per BOE $9.58 per BOE For the three months ended December 31, 2017, total revenue was $80.8 million and adjusted funds from operations was $32.9 million ($0.18 per share, diluted), compared to $55.7 million and $23.1 million ($0.13 per share, diluted) respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2016. At December 31, 2017, bank debt, net of working capital was $136.7 million, down 1% from $138.0 million at December 31, 2016.\nNet capital expenditures incurred during the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $55.8 million and for the year ended December 31, 2017, net capital expenditures were $128.0 million. During 2017, the Company spent $154.7 million on drill and complete operations, $78.0 million on equipment, facilities and pipelines and $11.1 million on land and seismic. During the year, Kelt realized proceeds of $116.3 million from asset dispositions and incurred $0.5 million on asset acquisitions.\nAs at December 31, 2017, Kelt’s net working interest land holdings were 852,181 acres (1,332 sections) of which 637,823 net acres (997 sections) are undeveloped. Kelt is focused on long-term value creation by accumulating significant undeveloped land acreage on resource style plays, with a primary focus on Triassic Montney oil and liquids-rich gas plays. At December 31, 2017, Kelt’s net Montney land holdings were 438,365 acres (685 sections).\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Kelt drilled seven horizontal wells that were not yet completed (“DUCs”) at year-end. Five wells were from a pad at Pouce Coupe in the Middle Montney (D2), the sixth well was drilled at Progress in the Middle Montney and the seventh well was drilled at Inga in the Upper Montney. These wells are all expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter in 2018. During the completion operations of the five-well pad at Pouce Coupe, the Company shut-in existing producing wells in the pool in order to mitigate damage while fracking. Kelt expects to bring the five-well pad and previously shut-in production at Pouce Coupe on-stream during March and April 2018.\nThe Progress Middle Montney well is expected to be put on production in July 2018 after tie-in pipeline construction is completed. In addition, Kelt has drilled two wells (at 56% working interest) in the Halfway oil play at Progress and expects to have these wells on-stream by early April 2018.\nAt Inga, Kelt is currently drilling a three-well pad targeting the Upper Montney, the IBZ Middle Montney and the Middle Montney formations. These wells are expected to be drilled by the end of the first quarter and are expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018.\nKelt continues to delineate its recently acquired undeveloped Montney lands at Oak/Flatrock in British Columbia and at Wembley/Pipestone in Alberta. At Oak/Flatrock, the Company has drilled two delineation wells to date in 2018 and expects to have these wells completed by April 2018.\nAt Wembley/Pipestone, Kelt has drilled three delineation wells to date in 2018 and a fourth well is expected to be drilled prior to the end of the first quarter. The Company has entered into an agreement with Tidewater Midstream and Infrastructure Ltd. (“Tidewater”) for firm processing of 25.0 MMcf per day of raw gas under a five year take-or-pay arrangement at Tidewater’s proposed deep-cut natural gas processing plant that is expected to be constructed and on-stream by the third quarter of 2019. Kelt, at its sole discretion, has the option to convert a part of its take-or-pay arrangement into an ownership interest (up to 15%) in the proposed Tidewater gas plant. The Company currently owns a fractional interest in the Cenovus Wembley Gas Plant which has allowed Kelt to produce its first Montney well at Wembley/Pipestone. The ability to produce solution gas on this oil prone Montney play through deep-cut gas processing facilities further enhances the overall oil/NGLs weighting in the play. The first well at Wembley/Pipestone had an IP120 of 1,009 BOE per day (46% oil, 27% NGLs and 27% gas). During the 120 day period, NGL recoveries were 110 barrels per MMcf of raw gas (or 160 barrels per MMcf of sales gas).\nOutlook and Guidance\nDuring the period of low oil and gas prices experienced by the energy industry, Kelt was well positioned to take advantage of opportunities to add value at a reasonable cost. The cost to acquire land at Crown sales in the Company’s core operating areas had dropped significantly and service related costs to drill and complete wells had also declined substantially. Kelt has transitioned to development pad drilling in order to take advantage of lower oilfield related service costs and will continue to test newly acquired exploration lands.\nWTI crude oil prices are forecasted to average US$58.50 per barrel in 2018, up 15% from the average price of US$50.95 per barrel in 2017. AECO natural gas prices are forecasted to average $1.96 per GJ in 2018, down 4% from the average price of $2.04 per GJ in 2017. Kelt is expected to realize a premium (prior to adjusting for heat content) of approximately 33% to the average forecasted AECO price in 2018 as a result of its diversified gas market contracts.\nThe Company’s Board of Directors previously approved a capital expenditure budget of $210.0 million for 2018 and this approved, budgeted amount is not being changed at this time. Kelt expects to drill 21 gross (20.1 net) wells in 2018, however the Company expects to complete 28 gross (27.1 net) wells in 2018 as there were 7 gross (7.0 net) DUC wells carried over into the 2018 program from 2017.\nForecasted average production in 2018 is estimated to be in the range from 28,500 BOE per day to 29,500 BOE per day, representing a 29% to 33% increase from average production of 22,130 BOE per day in 2017. It is estimated that this 2018 forecasted average production will be weighted 47% to oil/NGLs and 53% to gas. However, based on the Company’s forecasted commodity prices for 2018, 89% of forecasted operating income in 2018 is expected to be generated from oil and NGLs versus 11% from gas.\nOil and NGL prices have exceeded the Company’s estimates for January and February; however, gas prices to date have been lower than forecasted. The Company will re-evaluate its spending plans for the remainder of 2018 after the first quarter. With continued improvement in commodity prices, Kelt may consider increasing its capital program for the balance of 2018 at that time.\nAfter giving effect to the aforementioned production estimates, commodity price assumptions and estimated expenses, funds from operations for 2018 is forecasted to be approximately $200.0 million or $1.10 per common share, diluted. Kelt estimates that the Company’s bank debt, net of working capital, will be approximately $140.0 million as at December 31, 2018 (0.7 times forecasted 2018 funds from operations). Royalties are expected to average 10.8% of revenue in 2018. On average during 2018, combined production and transportation expense is estimated to be $12.86 per BOE ($9.54 per BOE and $3.32 per BOE respectively), G&A expense is estimated to be $0.76 per BOE and interest expense is forecasted at $0.85 per BOE.\nThe table below outlines the Company’s forecasted financial and operating guidance for 2018 and the comparative to previously announced 2018 guidance included in Kelt’s press release dated November 9, 2017:\n(CA$ millions, except as otherwise indicated) Current 2018 Guidance Previous 2018 Guidance Percent Change Average Production Oil & NGLs (bbls/d) 13,400 – 13,900 13,400 – 13,900 N/C Gas (mmcf/d) 90.6 – 93.6 90.6 – 93.6 N/C Combined (BOE/d) 28,500 – 29,500 28,500 – 29,500 N/C Production per million common shares (BOE/d) 158 – 164 159 – 165 Forecasted Average Commodity Prices WTI oil price (US$/bbl) 58.50 52.00 13 % Canadian Light Sweet ($/bbl) 69.80 61.52 13 % NYMEX natural gas price (US$/MMBTU) 3.05 3.15 - 3 % AECO natural gas price ($/GJ) 1.96 2.15 - 9 % Average Exchange Rate (US$/CA$) 0.790 0.794 - 1 % Capital Expenditures Drilling & completions 135.0 135.0 N/C Facilities, pipeline & well equipment 65.0 65.0 N/C Land, seismic & property acquisitions 10.0 10.0 N/C Net Capital Expenditures 210.0 210.0 N/C Funds from operations 200.0 175.0 14 % Per common share, diluted 1.10 0.97 13 % Bank debt, net of working capital, at year-end (1) 140.0 155.0 - 10 % Net bank debt to trailing annual funds from operations ratio 0.7 x 0.9 x - 22 % Weighted average common shares outstanding (millions) 180.0 179.0 1 % (1) In addition to bank debt, the Company has $90.0 million principal amount of convertible debentures outstanding with a coupon of 5% per annum, maturing May 31, 2021.\nKelt is currently unhedged in 2018. As a result, a 10% increase (decrease) in the Company’s forecasted average oil/NGLs price for 2018 would increase (decrease) forecasted funds from operations by approximately $24.5 million ($24.7 million). A 10% increase (decrease) in the Company’s average gas price forecasted for 2018 would increase (decrease) funds from operations by approximately $10.4 million ($10.1 million). An increase (decrease) in the forecasted average exchange rate by CA$/US$0.05 would increase (decrease) funds from operations by approximately $13.5 million ($13.6 million).\nThe table below outlines the Company’s revised forecasted financial guidance for 2018 compared to actual results for 2017:\n(CA$ millions, except as otherwise indicated) 2018 Guidance 2017 Actual Percent Change Average Production Oil & NGLs (bbls/d) 13,400 – 13,900 9,242 45% - 50 % Gas (mmcf/d) 90.6 – 93.6 77.3 17% - 21 % Combined (BOE/d) 28,500 – 29,500 22,130 29% - 33 % Production per million common shares (BOE/d) 158 – 164 125 26% - 31 % Forecasted Average Commodity Prices WTI oil price (US$/bbl) 58.50 50.95 15 % Canadian Light Sweet ($/bbl) 69.80 61.85 13 % NYMEX natural gas price (US$/MMBTU) 3.05 3.07 - 1 % AECO natural gas price ($/GJ) 1.96 2.04 - 4 % Average Exchange Rate (US$/CA$) 0.790 0.770 3 % Capital Expenditures Drilling & completions 135.0 154.7 - 13 % Facilities, pipeline & well equipment 65.0 78.0 - 17 % Land, seismic & property acquisitions 10.0 11.6 - 14 % Property dispositions - (116.3 ) N/A Net Capital Expenditures 210.0 128.0 64 % Adjusted funds from operations 200.0 108.0 85 % Per common share, diluted 1.10 0.61 80 % Bank debt, net of working capital, at year-end (1) 140.0 136.7 2 % Net bank debt to trailing annual funds from operations ratio 0.7 x 1.3 x - 46 % Weighted average common shares outstanding (millions) 180.0 176.5 2 % (1) In addition to bank debt, the Company has $90.0 million principal amount of convertible debentures outstanding with a coupon of 5% per annum, maturing May 31, 2021.\nChanges in forecasted commodity prices and variances in production estimates can have a significant impact on estimated funds from operations and profit. Please refer to the advisories regarding forward-looking statements and to the cautionary statement below.\nThe information set out herein is “financial outlook” within the meaning of applicable securities laws. The purpose of this financial outlook is to provide readers with disclosure regarding Kelt’s reasonable expectations as to the anticipated results of its proposed business activities for the calendar year 2018. Readers are cautioned that this financial outlook may not be appropriate for other purposes.\nExecutive Resignation\nAshley Hohm, Vice President, Finance, has advised the Company that she will resign, effective April 17, 2018. Ms. Hohm will assist the Company with transition prior to her departure. Kelt and the Board of Directors would like to thank Ms. Hohm for her contributions to the Company over the past five years and wish her well in her future endeavours. Kelt has commenced a search for Ms. Hohm’s replacement through an executive search firm.\nAdvisory Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws. The use of any of the words “expect”, “anticipate”, “continue”, “estimate”, “objective”, “ongoing”, “may”, “will”, “project”, “should”, “believe”, “plans”, “intends”, “potentially” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking information or statements. In particular, this press release contains forward-looking statements pertaining to the following: Kelt’s expectation that its gas pricing will realize a premium of approximately 33% to the average AECO price in 2018 as a result of its diversified gas market contracts; Tidewater’s proposed deep-cut natural gas processing plant that is expected to be constructed and on-stream by the third quarter of 2019; the completion of seven DUCs in Alberta by the end of the first quarter of 2018 and bringing on-stream certain previously shut-in existing wells in the same pool; tieing-in and bringing on-stream a Progress Middle Montney well by July 2018 and bringing on-stream two Halfway oil wells at Progress during March and April 2018; the drilling, by March 2018 and completion by April 2018, of a three well pad targeting three different formations at Inga; the completion of two delineation wells at Oak/Flatrock by April 2018; the drilling of a fourth delineation well at Wembley/Pipestone prior to the end of the first quarter of 2018; and the timing of future development capital expenditures generally. Statements relating to \"reserves\" or “resources” are deemed to be forward looking statements, as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the reserves described exist in the quantities predicted or estimated and that the reserves can be profitably produced in the future. Actual reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein.\nAlthough Kelt believes that the expectations and assumptions on which the forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because Kelt cannot give any assurance that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to, the risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general (e.g., operational risks in development, exploration and production; delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures; the uncertainty of reserve estimates; the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production, costs and expenses; failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for planned operations; health, safety and environmental risks; uncertainties resulting from potential delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures; volatility of commodity prices, currency exchange rate fluctuations; imprecision of reserve estimates; and competition from other explorers) as well as general economic conditions, stock market volatility; and the ability to access sufficient capital. We caution that the foregoing list of risks and uncertainties is not exhaustive.\nIn addition, the reader is cautioned that historical results are not necessarily indicative of future performance. The forward-looking statements contained herein are made as of the date hereof and the Company does not intend, and does not assume any obligation, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise unless expressly required by applicable securities laws.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Key Performance Indicators\nThis press release contains certain financial measures, as described below, which do not have standardized meanings prescribed by GAAP. In addition, this press release contains other key performance indicators (“KPI”), financial and non-financial, that do not have standardized meanings under the applicable securities legislation. As these non-GAAP financial measures and KPI are commonly used in the oil and gas industry, the Company believes that their inclusion is useful to investors. The reader is cautioned that these amounts may not be directly comparable to measures for other companies where similar terminology is used.\nNon-GAAP financial measures\n“Operating income” is calculated by deducting royalties, production expenses and transportation expenses from petroleum and natural gas revenue, net of the cost of purchases and after realized gains or losses on associated financial instruments. The Company refers to operating income expressed per unit of production as an “operating netback”. “Adjusted funds from operations” is calculated as cash provided by operating activities before changes in non-cash operating working capital, and adding back (if applicable): transaction costs associated with acquisitions and dispositions, provisions for potential credit losses, and settlement of decommissioning obligations. Adjusted funds from operations per common share is calculated on a consistent basis with profit (loss) per common share, using basic and diluted weighted average common shares as determined in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted funds from operations and operating income or netbacks are used by Kelt as key measures of performance and are not intended to represent operating profits nor should they be viewed as an alternative to cash provided by operating activities, profit or other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThroughout this press release, reference is made to “revenue” and “average realized prices”. “Revenue” refers to petroleum and natural gas revenue, before royalties, as reported in the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. “Average realized prices” per unit of production are calculated based on revenue (before royalties) after deducting the cost of purchases related to third party volumes, and reflect the Company's realized selling prices plus the net benefit of oil blending/marketing activities. Given the Company’s per unit operating statistics disclosed throughout this press release are calculated based on Kelt’s production volumes, management believes that disclosing Kelt’s average realized prices on this basis is appropriate and useful, because the cost of third party volumes purchased to generate incremental marketing revenue has been deducted. “Average realized prices” referenced throughout this press release are before financial instruments, except as otherwise indicated as being after financial instruments.\nThe term “net bank debt” is used synonymously with, and is equal to, “bank debt, net of working capital”. “Net bank debt” is calculated by adding the working capital deficiency to bank debt. The working capital deficiency is equal to total current assets net of total current liabilities. The Company uses a “net bank debt to trailing adjusted funds from operations ratio” as a benchmark on which management monitors the Company’s capital structure and short-term financing requirements. Management believes that this ratio, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, provides investors with information to understand the Company’s liquidity risk. The “net bank debt to trailing adjusted funds from operations ratio” is also indicative of the “debt to cash flow” calculation used to determine the applicable margin for a quarter under the Company’s Credit Facility agreement (though the calculation may not always be a precise match, it is representative).\nOther KPI\n“Production per common share” is calculated by dividing total production by the basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding, as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nMeasurements\nAll dollar amounts are referenced in thousands of Canadian dollars, except when noted otherwise. This press release contains various references to the abbreviation BOE which means barrels of oil equivalent. Where amounts are expressed on a BOE basis, natural gas volumes have been converted to oil equivalence at six thousand cubic feet per barrel and sulphur volumes have been converted to oil equivalence at 0.6 long tons per barrel. The term BOE may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet per barrel is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead and is significantly different than the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil and natural gas. This conversion factor is an industry accepted norm and is not based on either energy content or current prices. Such abbreviation may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. References to “oil” in this press release include crude oil and field condensate. References to “natural gas liquids” or “NGLs” include pentane, butane, propane, and ethane. References to “liquids” include field condensate and NGLs. References to “gas” in this discussion include natural gas and sulphur.\nAbbreviations\nbbls barrels bbls/d barrels per day mcf thousand cubic feet mcf/d thousand cubic feet per day mmcf million cubic feet mmcf/d million cubic feet per day tcf trillion cubic feet MMBTU million British Thermal Units GJ gigajoule BOE barrel of oil equivalent BOE/d barrel of oil equivalent per day NGLs natural gas liquids LNG liquefied natural gas AECO Alberta Energy Company “C” Meter Station of the NOVA Pipeline System NIT NOVA Inventory Transfer (“AB-NIT”), being the reference price at the AECO Hub WTI West Texas Intermediate NYMEX New York Mercantile Exchange US$ United States dollars CA$ Canadian dollars DUC refers to drilled but un-completed wells LMM Lower-Middle Montney also referred to as “Montney Sexsmith” or “D1” UMM Upper-Middle Montney also referred to as “Montney H” or “D2” IBZ “In-Between Zone” of the Middle Montney IP120 initial production from a well for the first 2,880 hours (120 days) based on operating/producing hours TSX the Toronto Stock Exchange KEL trading symbol for Kelt Exploration Ltd. common shares on the TSX KEL.DB trading symbol for Kelt Exploration Ltd. 5% convertible debentures on the TSX GAAP Generally Accepted Accounting Principles KPI Key Performance Indicators For further information, please contact:\nKelt Exploration Ltd., Suite 300, 311 – 6 th Avenue SW, Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2P 3H2\nDavid J.
