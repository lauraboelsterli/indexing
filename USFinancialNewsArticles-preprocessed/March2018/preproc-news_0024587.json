    "text": "WASHINGTONâ€”Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has long been a critic of federal gun control and has focused on what she calls lax policies on school discipline, signaling her likely priorities as head of a new commission on school safety.\nThe panel, which the White House announced Sunday as part of a larger school-safety strategy, is charged with studying a range of issues, including a proposal to raise the minimum age for firearms purchases and the impact that videogames and the media have on violence.\n... RELATED VIDEO 20 Years of School Shootings Since 1998, there have been more than a dozen shootings at kindergarten, elementary, middle and high schools that resulted in multiple deaths. These are some of the victims. ",
