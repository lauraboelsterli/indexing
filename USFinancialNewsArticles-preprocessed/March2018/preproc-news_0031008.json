European Commision President Jean-Claude Juncker speaks in the Bosnian Parliament in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, February 28, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic “It is obvious that we need further clarity from the UK if we are to reach an understanding on our future relationship,” Juncker told a plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg. “As the clock counts down, with one year to go, it is now time to translate speeches into treaties, to turn commitments into agreements,” he added.
