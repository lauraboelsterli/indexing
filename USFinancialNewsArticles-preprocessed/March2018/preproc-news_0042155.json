Top officials in Washington and Beijing have started negotiating over a range of ways to improve access by American companies to Chinese markets, the WSJ’s Lingling Wei and Bob Davis report. The talks may provide relief to those rattled by announcements last week of U.S. plans to hit China with tariffs and other measures aimed at addressing the U.S. $375 billion merchandise trade deficit with China. The negotiations cover a wide range of areas, including financial services and manufacturing, and are being led by Liu He, China’s economic czar, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer. The U.S. demands offer an opportunity for China to respond in very specific areas such as automotive trade, providing details Beijing has been looking for as the sharp rhetoric between the countries has escalated.\nFrom farmers to tractor makers, companies across U.S. agriculture supply chains are bracing for a trade battle with China that many say couldn’t come at a worse time. Farm incomes this year are expected to slide to their lowest level since 2006, prolonging a downturn that has pushed some farmers out of business and eroded profits for seed, chemical and equipment companies. The WSJ’s Jesse Newman, Jacob Bunge and Benjamin Parkin write that exports have become more important to the U.S. farm economy as improved operations and efficient logistics networks made American farmers a premier global source of foodstuffs. China is the second-biggest customer for U.S. agricultural products after Canada, and its planned tariffs on pork, fruit, nuts and other goods could worsen the U.S. farm economy’s slump. Fewer buyers for U.S. crops could hurt manufacturers like Deere & Co., which last year reported modest improvement in sales of farm equipment after three years of declines amid falling crop prices.\nU.S. crude exports are on a tear, but foreign trade houses appear to be reaping some of the biggest gains. Two years after Washington lifted a ban on exporting U.S. oil, a handful of international houses are dominating the buying and selling of that crude thanks to their greater expertise in trading and logistics. The WSJ’s Sarah McFarlane writes that shipments by three of the world’s top five oil traders accounted for 22% of U.S. crude exports in the past year. That’s partly the result of the fragmented nature of the U.S. shale industry, which can’t compete with more nimble, mostly Europe-based trade houses that buy and sell oil and ship it around the world. Some of the foreign traders’ edge in U.S. exports is expected to diminish as logistical issues are ironed out and U.S. infrastructure is built to handle outbound flows, but international traders have a foothold and say they’re in the business for the long haul.\nSUPPLY CHAIN STRATEGIES The Yangshan Deep Water Port at the Port of Shanghai. Photo: Bloomberg News Anyone handling the shipping of live crocodiles fully understands the importance of packaging in supply chains. Exporters in Australia’s outback are turning to new strategies to get a bigger share of a high-value, high-risk business that takes crocs from marshlands to catwalks, including use of “travel pods” fashioned from plumbing pipes. The WSJ’s Rob Taylor writes the innovation is the latest tactic in a luxury goods market that turns crocodile skins into boots and handbags that can sell for $50,000 apiece and more—a booming business, especially in Asia. With luxury retailers looking for perfect skins for their final products, there’s an enormous premium on distribution that can preserve the animals and their skins without a scratch. Farmers have to be creative to move animals with as many as 72 razor-sharp teeth, notoriously bad attitudes and little interest in entering high-fashion supply chains.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ You open up the pods and you’ve got 70 pairs of crocodile eyes staring at you. For a heart-stopping moment you’re hoping like hell that the refrigeration worked and they don’t come rushing out in a waterfall of crocs. ’\n—Adam Lever, an Australian crocodile farmer, on new shipping techniques.\nNumber of the Day 5% Decline in Shanghai Container Freight Index for shipping rates from Shanghai to European ports last week, the fourth straight weekly decline .\nIN OTHER NEWS The U.S. and South Korea reached an agreement to amend their free trade deal and resolved a trade friction over U.S. steep tariffs on South Korean steel.
