    "text": "ALGIERS (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil Corp has shown an interest in working in Algeria, the head of state energy firm Sonatrach said on Tuesday.\nA logo of Exxon Mobil is displayed on a monitor above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange shortly after the opening bell in New York, U.S., December 5, 2017. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson “It is important to highlight that a big major Exxon Mobil has shown an interest to come to Algeria,” Abdelmoumen Ould Kaddour told reporters, without giving further details.\nHe also said he had resolved 80 percent of the state firm’s disputes with foreign firms, while Sonatrach had been able to fulfill gas supply contracts with Europe this winter despite rising domestic demand.\nKaddour, a U.S.-trained engineer, who took office last year to overhaul Sonatrach plagued by contract disputes with foreign firms, red tape, stagnant production and corruption scandals.\nFILE PHOTO: Abdelmoumen Ould Kaddour, Chief Executive of Algerian state energy firm Sonatrach, looks on during the launch of new gas pipeline from southwestern fields, Algeria, February 8, 2018. REUTERS/Lamine Chikhi OPEC member Algeria and a major gas supplier to Europe, has been hit hard by a slump in world oil prices and has struggled to attract energy investment to help develop new fields and increase existing production.\nIn December, Sonatrach said it planned to work more closely with France’s Total on offshore, petrochemical, solar energy and shale exploration projects after settling disputes over profit-sharing on oil and gas contracts.\nAlgeria remains dependent on oil and gas earnings, which provide 60 percent of the state budget, and Sonatrach’s performance is key to the health of the economy.\nThe country has been working on a new energy law to provide better incentives for foreign firms, which had been deterred by current terms.\nBut there are still divergent views within Algeria over how hard to push for foreign investment and domestic economic reform to boost revenue and spur growth.\nReporting by Lamine Chikhi; Writing by Ulf Laessing, editing by David Evans\n ",
