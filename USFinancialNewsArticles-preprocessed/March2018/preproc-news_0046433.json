REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo Pretax profit in December through February, H&M’s fiscal first quarter, shrank 61 percent to 1.26 billion crowns (£108.24 million) from a year-ago 3.21 billion, against a mean forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts for 1.29 billion. H&M in February warned markdowns due to weak demand in many of its main H&M brand’s stores would hit earnings, and earlier this month said sales shrank for a second straight quarter, by 2 percent, sending shares down.
