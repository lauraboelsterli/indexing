The foundation Quote: d Genentech as saying it has limited information about the circumstances surrounding the deaths but that Genentech reported they have “all been deemed unrelated to Hemlibra by the investigator or treating physician”.\nRoche did not immediately comment, when contacted on Wednesday.
