    "text": "Highly regarded industry veteran becomes Principal, will bolster growing Tri-State investment sales practice\nNEW YORK, March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Mitti Liebersohn , Avison Young Principal and President of the firm's New York City office, today announced that real estate investment sales specialist James Kinsey has joined the company.\nEffective immediately, Kinsey becomes a Principal of Avison Young and Director of Tri-State Investment Sales. Based in New York City, he will focus on expanding the firm's investment sales platform throughout the Tri-State area. He will also further the growth of the company's structured finance platforms. Kinsey brings 15 years of commercial real estate experience to Avison Young, most recently as president of Kinsey Capital, LLC.\n\"James is a highly regarded industry leader with outstanding credentials and a successful track record of delivering creative strategies and solutions to both private and institutional investors,\" comments Liebersohn. \"His market knowledge, client relationships and outstanding leadership skills make him an ideal fit for our firm, and his presence will bring an even greater depth of overall capital markets experience that we can offer to clients.\"\nDuring his career, Kinsey has negotiated the sale or financing of more than $625 million worth of commercial properties.\n\"James is an important addition to our expanding Tri-State investment sales team,\" states Arthur Mirante , Avison Young Principal and President of the firm's Tri-State region. \"He is a well-respected industry veteran with experience in a variety of brokerage areas, including investment sales representing the seller, identifying and securing conventional and private financing, strategic marketing of properties, and asset management. Based on his diverse experience, he understands the importance of collaboration in all stages of the investment transaction and the benefits of a full-service business model.\"\nKinsey's hire comes on the heels of the appointment of James Nelson as Head of Tri-State Investment Sales on February 5, 2018.\n\"I could not be happier for James to oversee our sales force and operations, which will cover office, multi-family, retail and development,\" states Nelson.\nKinsey began his real estate career in 2002 by partnering with his late father and Louis Varone to form Kinsey Capital Associates, LLC, a commercial real estate brokerage company based in New York City. After a stint at Massey Knakal Realty as a territory expert in the NoHo/NoLiTa market, Kinsey co-founded ERG Property Advisors, a full-service commercial brokerage firm in New York City. In 2012, he formed Kinsey Capital, LLC as a boutique investment sales firm based in Manhattan, which eventually expanded to London as Kinsey Capital Limited. During his career, Kinsey has worked with industry leaders across various asset lines in a strategic manner, and he will continue to expand these relationships within the Avison Young platform.\n\"Having owned and operated my own firm while developing teams, I understand what it takes to be successful in this business,\" says Kinsey. \"I was looking to join a firm that aligned with my values and philosophy of aggressive growth, collaboration and a client-focused approach. Avison Young fit the bill, and I look forward to working with the team and tapping into its successful Principal-led platform that is global in reach, yet local to the New York City investment community.\"\nHe adds: \"I am also thrilled to be working closely again with James Nelson, a friend and colleague for nearly 20 years. The opportunity to reunite with James, coupled with the potential accomplishments of our collaborative efforts, is very exciting.\"\nKinsey holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in music from Boston College. He is a Certified Commercial Investment Member (CCIM) and active with the organization's New York chapter. In addition, he is a member of The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (MRICS), the U.K. professional body that enforces the highest international standards in the valuation, management and development of land, real estate, construction and infrastructure.\nAdds John Kevill , Avison Young Principal and Managing Director, U.S. Capital Markets: \"James' presence as a leader will be a tremendous benefit to the team in New York as well as across the company. We couldn't be more excited to incorporate James' proven knowledge of best practices and his industry relationships into Avison Young's capital markets business. His hire is one more important step for us as we become the leader in driving solutions for our clients in New York, the U.S. and globally.\"\nAvison Young is the world's fastest-growing commercial real estate services firm.
