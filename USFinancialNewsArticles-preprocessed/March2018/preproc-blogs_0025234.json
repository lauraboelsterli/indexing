    "text": "Former Petrobras CEO sentenced to 11 years in jail Published 3:52 PM ET Wed, 7 March 2018 The Associated Press \nSAO PAULO (AP) â€” A former chief executive officer of Brazil's state oil company Petrobras has been sentenced to 11 years in prison as part of sprawling corruption investigation that has ensnared many of the country's top business and political leaders. \nFederal Judge Sergio Moro found Aldemir Bendine guilty Wednesday of corruption and money laundering in connection with about $1 million in bribes paid by construction giant Odebrecht. \nMoro said Bendine used his influence to illegally help the builder between 2014 and 2017. He was arrested in July and is the only ex-Petrobras CEO implicated in the so-called \"Car Wash\" investigation. \nBendine was named head of Brazil's second largest bank, Banco do Brasil, in 2009 by then-President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Six years later, President Dilma Rousseff made him CEO of Petrobras.",
