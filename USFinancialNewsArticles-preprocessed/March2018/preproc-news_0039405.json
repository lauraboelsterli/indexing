    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- MSCI Inc. (NYSE: MSCI), a leading provider of indexes and portfolio construction and risk management tools and services for global investors, announced today that Rodolphe (“Skip”) M. Vallee and Patrick Tierney will retire from the MSCI Board of Directors. Mr. Vallee’s retirement will be effective at the upcoming MSCI 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders on May 10, 2018, which is the end of his current term. Mr. Tierney’s retirement will be effective May 1, 2018. Mr. Vallee has served as a director since 2008 and MSCI’s Lead Director since 2010. Mr. Tierney has served as a director since 2010. The independent directors have elected Robert G. Ashe as Lead Director, effective April 30, 2018. Mr. Ashe has served as a director since 2013.\n“I have enjoyed working closely with Skip as Lead Director, a role in which he helped forge an effective collaboration between the Board and senior management to set MSCI’s strategic direction and ensure a strong focus on driving shareholder value. Having joined the Board shortly after our IPO, Skip has been integral to developing the Board’s operating framework, building a Board with a diverse and robust set of skills and experiences and strengthening our risk management program,” said Henry A. Fernandez, MSCI’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “His entrepreneurial spirit, business acumen and commitment to delivering shareholder value have been invaluable during a period of significant growth in our first ten years as a public company.”\n“Over the years, the MSCI Board and senior management have greatly benefited from Pat’s expertise and counsel on various aspects of managing a complex and global business, including with respect to M&A transactions, and from his service on the Compensation & Talent Management Committee, where he has advised management on the performance culture transformation that underlies the successful execution of our strategy. Through Pat’s many contributions, the Board has evolved into being a more effective governing body,” said Mr. Fernandez.\n“In his roles as Chair of the Strategy and Finance Committee and as a member of the Audit Committee, Rob has successfully advised senior management with respect to its strategic initiatives, as well as business management and technology-related matters. I am confident that Rob will be a strong and effective independent lead director and I look forward to working with him as we continue to evolve and transform our business to capitalize on the many opportunities that lie ahead,” commented Mr. Fernandez.\n“On behalf of the Board, the MSCI management team and our shareholders, I want to express my deep appreciation to both Skip and Pat for their relentless dedication in helping MSCI play a vital role in the global investment industry. We will miss having them as members of our Board and wish them all the best in their next endeavors,” concluded Mr. Fernandez.\nAbout MSCI\nFor more than 40 years, MSCI's research-based indexes and analytics have helped the world’s leading investors build and manage better portfolios.
