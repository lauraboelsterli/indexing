    "text": "March 13, 2018 / 3:23 PM / in 14 minutes CANADA STOCKS-Toronto stocks climb on gold lift, Poloz comments Reuters Staff 2 Min Read NEW YORK, March 13 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index rose on Tuesday as gold producers advanced and comments from Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz that indicated the central bank will remain cautious in policy decisions. * At 11:17AM ET (15:17 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index rose 60.97 points, or 0.39 percent, to 15,665.76. * The head of the Bank of Canada said there remains a degree of untapped potential in the Canadian economy, particularly in the labor market, that means the country may be able to generate more growth without higher inflation. * The gold subsector rose 0.65 percent as pot gold percent to $1,322.36 an ounce following the ouster of U.S. Secretary of State by President Donald Trump. * Healthcare shares advanced 0.68 percent, lifted by a gain of more than 2 percent in Valeant Pharmaceuticals after pricing an upsized senior note offering of $1.5 billion. * The TSX posted 4 new 52-week highs and one new low. Across all Canadian issues there were 54 new 52-week highs and 15 new lows. * The largest percentage gainer on the TSX was Lucara Diamond, which rose 4.2 percent, while the largest decliner was Secure Energy, down 2.9 percent. * Among the most active Canadian stocks by volume were Aurora Cannabis, down 0.8 percent to $11.56 and UrtheCast Corp, down 4.5 percent to $0.43 (Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak)",
