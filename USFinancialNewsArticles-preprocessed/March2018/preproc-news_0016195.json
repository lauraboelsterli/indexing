The Fed’s next policy meeting is scheduled for March 20-21.\nAmong other stocks, discount store operator Dollar Tree slumped 12 percent after reporting disappointing holiday quarter results.\nAbercrombie & Fitch Co jumped 5 percent after the teen fashion retailer beat analysts’ estimates for holiday quarter sales at established stores.
