    "text": "March 9, 2018 / 8:42 AM / in 8 hours South Korea's 2012 bronze medalist Chung dies aged 35 Reuters Staff 2 Min Read SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean badminton player Chung Jae-sung, who won bronze in the men’s doubles at the London Olympics, has died at the age of 35, the Korea Badminton Association said on Friday. South Korea's Chung Jae-sung sits on the court in disappointment after he and teammate Lee Yong-dae (back) lost their men's doubles badminton semifinal match against Denmark's Mathias Boe and Carsten Mogensen at the London 2012 Olympic Games at the Wembley Arena August 4, 2012. REUTERS/Bazuki Muhammad Chung was found dead by his wife at their home early on Friday, a badminton official said by telephone, adding that the cause of death was not yet known and that an autopsy would be performed on Saturday. Yonhap News quoted local police as saying Chung had been diagnosed with arrhythmia three years ago and that he had complained of chest pains at times. Chung partnered Lee Yong-dae to third place at London in 2012 with their victory over Malaysian pair Koo Kien Keat and Tan Boon Heong. His death was keenly felt across the global badminton community. “I’m so sorry to hear this news. He was super fit as a player,” Malaysia’s The Star quoted Tan as saying. Former world number one Lee Chong Wei said: “This is sad news. I offer my condolences to his wife and two children and I pray that the family will stay strong”.
