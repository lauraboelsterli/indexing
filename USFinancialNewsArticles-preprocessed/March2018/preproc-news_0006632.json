    "text": "A German law requiring social media companies like Facebook and Twitter to quickly remove hate speech from their sites is set to be revised following criticism that too much online content is being blocked, according to officials.\nDaniel Sambraus | Photographer's Choice | Getty Images The law, which came into full force on Jan. 1, is the most ambitious effort by a Western democracy to control what appears on social media. It aims to ensure Germany's tough prohibitions against hate speech, including pro-Nazi ideology, are enforced online by requiring sites to remove banned content within 24 hours or face fines of up to 50 million euros ($62 million). \nThe law, called NetzDG for short, is an international test case and how it plays out is being closely watched by other countries considering similar measures.\nGerman politicians forming a new government told Reuters they want to add an amendment to help web users get incorrectly deleted material restored online. \nThe lawmakers are also pushing for social media firms to set up an independent body to review and respond to reports of offensive content from the public, rather than the individual companies doing that themselves. \nSuch a system, similar to how video games are policed in Germany, could allow a more considered approach to complex decisions about whether to block content, legal experts say.\nThe proposed changes follow widespread criticism from opponents of the law, including free speech campaigners and the Association of German Journalists, who say the threat of hefty fines is prompting internet firms to err on the side of caution and block more content than is necessary. \nThey point to several high-profile cases, including when a satirical magazine's Twitter account was blocked after it parodied anti-Muslim comments.\nFacebook, which says it has 1,200 people in Germany working on reviewing posts out of 14,000 globally responsible for moderating content and account security, said it was \"not pursuing a strategy to delete more than necessary\". \nshow chapters",
