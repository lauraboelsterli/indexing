    "text": "WOODSIDE, Calif., March 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GSV Capital Corp. (“GSV Capital” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:GSVC) today announced the pricing of $40.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “Notes”). In addition, GSV Capital has granted the underwriters of the Notes a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $6.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The sale of the Notes is expected to close on March 28, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nThe Notes will be convertible into shares of GSV Capital’s common stock (the “common stock”) based on an initial conversion rate of 93.2836 shares of the common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $10.72 per share. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 28, 2023, the Notes will be convertible at any time.\nThe Notes will mature on March 28, 2023, unless earlier repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms. Interest on the Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on March 31 and September 30 of each year, commencing on September 30, 2018. The Notes will be general, unsecured, senior obligations of GSV Capital. Holders of the Notes may require GSV Capital to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change prior to maturity for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date.\n“We are excited to announce this important step forward for GSV Capital and pleased to be supported by a syndicate of world-class institutional investors,\" said Michael Moe, Executive Chairman of GSV Capital. \"We see tremendous opportunities to invest in leading, growth stage VC-backed companies, with the convertible note providing capital to execute against our strategy. Strong interest in the listings of top GSV Capital positions, Dropbox and Spotify, reinforces our focus on building a portfolio of rapidly growing, premier private companies.”\nGSV Capital intends to use all of the net proceeds from the offering to repurchase or pay at maturity a portion of the Company’s outstanding 5.25% Convertible Senior Notes, which mature on September 15, 2018.\nBTIG is acting as the sole manager for the offering.\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes or any other securities, nor shall there be any offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy these or any other securities, in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the security laws of any state or jurisdiction.
