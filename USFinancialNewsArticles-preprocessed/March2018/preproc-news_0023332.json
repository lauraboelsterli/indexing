(NYSE: WTI) today announced that it was the successful bidder on an interest in three blocks in the Heidelberg field in the Gulf of Mexico offered in connection with the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings of Cobalt International Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries. The successful bid covers all of Cobalt's interest in the Heidelberg Field, which includes a 9.375% working interest in each of Green Canyon 859, 903, and 904. The Heidelberg Field is operated by Anadarko Petroleum Corporation. W&T's bid was for $31.1 million cash.
