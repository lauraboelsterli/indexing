    "text": "FARGO, N.D., March 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NI Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:NODK) today announced that its Board of Directors has approved an authorization for the repurchase of up to approximately $10 million of the company’s outstanding common stock. This authorization supports our planned approach to capital deployment to create long-term value for our shareholders – through share repurchases and future strategic acquisitions.\nThe actual timing, number, and value of common shares repurchased under the plan will be determined by management in its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including, among others, general market and business conditions, the trading price of common shares, and applicable legal requirements. The Company has no obligation to repurchase any common shares under the authorization, and the repurchase plan may be suspended, discontinued, or modified at any time for any reason.\nNI Holdings, Inc. had 22,313,329 shares of common stock outstanding as of November 10, 2017, per the company’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017.\nAbout the Company\nNI Holdings, Inc. is an insurance holding company. The company is a North Dakota business corporation that is the stock holding company of Nodak insurance Company and became such in connection with the conversion of Nodak Mutual Insurance Company from a mutual to stock form of organization and the creation of a mutual holding company. The conversion was consummated on March 13, 2017. Immediately following the conversion, all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Nodak Insurance Company were issued to Nodak Mutual Group, Inc., which then contributed the shares to NI Holdings in exchange for 55% of the outstanding shares of common stock of NI Holdings. Nodak Insurance Company then became a wholly owned stock subsidiary of NI Holdings.\nNodak Insurance Company owns American West Insurance Company and Primero Insurance Company. Nodak Insurance Company also manages Battle Creek Mutual Insurance Company and reinsures 100% of the risk on all insurance policies issued by Battle Creek. NI Holdings’ financial statements are the consolidated financial results of NI Holdings and Nodak Insurance, including Nodak Insurance’s subsidiaries American West and Primero, and its affiliate Battle Creek.\nSafe Harbor Statement\nCertain statements made by the company which are not historical facts may be considered , within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
