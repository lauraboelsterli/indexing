    "text": "March 26, 2018 / 7:47 AM / Updated 3 hours ago Tuilagi suffers injury setback in Leicester win over Wasps Reuters Staff 2 Min Read (Reuters) - Manu Tuilagi will undergo a scan on the chest injury he picked up during the Leicester Tigers’ thrilling 16-15 victory over Wasps on Sunday, the latest blow to the marauding centre’s hopes of making an England comeback. Rugby Union - Premiership - Leicester Tigers vs Saracens - Welford Road Stadium, Leicester, Britain - December 24, 2017 Leicester Tigers' Manu Tuilagi Action Images/Andrew Boyers Tuilagi has not played for England for more than two years due to a string of injuries, but the game against Wasps was his eighth consecutive start for Leicester in the Premiership. The 26-year-old lasted 12 minutes before he signalled to the medical team that he could not continue, clutching the right side of his chest in distress. The injury is on the other side of his chest from the torn pectoral muscle that sidelined him for six months in the 2013-14 season and there is hope he will make a quick recovery. “He’s got a pec issue,” Leicester’s head coach Matt O’Connor told reporters. “He was pretty adamant he couldn’t continue, so from that point we know there’s something wrong with Manu. “But he was pretty confident in the changing room it’s not a massive issue.” Tuilagi had hoped to win back his place in the national side for their tour of South Africa in June, but his latest setback, which follows a knee injury earlier in the season, will temper the sense of optimism around his progress. Elliot Daly and Jonny May also came off injured in the first half on Sunday, news that will not be welcomed by England head coach Eddie Jones. May was knocked unconscious by a tackle from Christian Wade, while Daly, who scored both of Wasps’ tries, dislocated a finger and was given oxygen before he left the field of play. “It’s a bad dislocation,” Wasps director of rugby Dai Young said. “The bone came out as well, quite nasty and quite painful. I’d like to think it’s weeks not months but the way we’re going, who knows?” Reporting by Simon Jennings in Bengaluru; Editing by John O'Brien",
