    "text": "Published: Mar 27, 2018 12:01 p.m. ET Share \nIn the wake of sexual harassment allegations, more attention is going to gender discrimination Getty Images Among the widest gender pay gaps in all of the U.K.: U.S. investment banks. \nBy Margot Patrick \nU.S. investment banks in London have some of the biggest gender pay gaps in the country, reflecting long-established cultures of men dominating top trading and advisory roles and women working in junior posts or as administrators. \nWomen are paid around half as much as men in the main U.K. investment banking units of Bank of America Corp. BAC, -0.90% , JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, -0.11% and Morgan MS, -0.22% marking the widest gaps among around 40 global financial companies that have reported pay data to the U.K. government. \nIn one small JPMorgan unit that included senior merger-and-acquisition bankers on the snapshot day for the pay data, April 5, 2017, women were paid 54% less, and women’s bonuses were 89% less than those paid to men. The pay gap across JPMorgan’s 16,000 U.K. employees was 36%, as measured by median hourly pay, and 47% in its largest investment banking unit. \nBank of America’s investment banking units paid women 47% less, while the gap across all of its 6,000 U.K. employees was 31%. Part of the issue: Women hold 98% of the bank’s lower-paid administrative posts, it said. ",
