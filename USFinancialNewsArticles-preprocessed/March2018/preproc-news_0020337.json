    "text": "WASHINGTON, March 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Crowell & Moring LLP is pleased to announce that Chuck Rosenberg , a former two-time U.S. Attorney who has served in senior-ranking positions in the Department of Justice over three administrations, including as chief of staff to the FBI director and Acting Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, has joined the firm's nationally recognized White Collar & Regulatory Enforcement group as senior counsel. At Crowell & Moring, Rosenberg's practice will encompass federal white collar criminal defense, internal investigations, monitorships, and corporate governance.\nRosenberg is an accomplished trial lawyer who for more than two decades advised on policy and enforcement issues of national importance concerning counterterrorism, counterintelligence, public corruption, financial crimes, and national security. In addition to serving as the DEA's Acting Administrator from May 2015 to October 2017, and chief of staff to then-FBI Director James Comey (2013-2015), Rosenberg is a two-time former U.S. Attorney, having served in the Eastern District of Virginia (2006-2008) – a district routinely entrusted with many of the nation's most sensitive terrorism and national security prosecutions – and the Southern District of Texas (2005-2006). He is a commentator on issues at the intersection of national security, law, and politics for MSNBC.\n\"Chuck is among the most respected and trusted legal talents in Washington, and we are delighted that he is joining Crowell & Moring,\" said Philip T. Inglima , chair of Crowell & Moring. \"Through his experience operating at the highest levels of the Justice Department, he gained unsurpassed insight into the government's enforcement priorities and processes. He will undoubtedly enhance the firm's white collar capabilities to conduct monitorships and sensitive internal investigations, and he will be an invaluable counselor to clients facing significant legal, regulatory, and public policy challenges.\"\nIn his most recent role, Rosenberg managed the operations of the DEA, overseeing 16,000 personnel in 300 offices around the world. He was also counselor to then-Attorney General John Ashcroft (2003-2004) and then-FBI director Robert Mueller (2002-2003). Earlier in his career, from 1994 to 2000, he was an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia. In that role, he tried dozens of cases before juries and frequently argued before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. He was a partner at Hogan Lovells from 2008 to 2013.\n\"Chuck's experience and leadership ability are unmatched,\" said Daniel L. Zelenko , chair of the firm's White Collar and Regulatory Enforcement Group. \"He will be a tremendous asset to our deep team of white collar lawyers across the country.\"\nA notable aspect of Rosenberg's practice is advising boards of directors and executives on governance and ethics issues. During his earlier stints in private practice, he established a reputation for insightful and candid strategic advice.\n\"Crowell & Moring has an outstanding reputation within the white collar bar for handling the most sensitive investigations and disputes,\" Rosenberg said. \"I am thrilled to build on the firm's capabilities in these areas.\"\nRosenberg received his J.D. from the University of Virginia, his M.P.P from Harvard University, and his B.A. from Tufts University.\nAbout Crowell & Moring's White Collar & Regulatory Enforcement Group\nCrowell & Moring's White Collar & Regulatory Enforcement Group routinely represents clients in the most significant white collar cases in the United States and has successfully defended and counseled clients around the world regarding all manner of government investigations, criminal trials, regulatory enforcement actions, and internal investigations.
