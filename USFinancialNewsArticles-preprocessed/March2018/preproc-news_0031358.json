    "text": "March 17, 2018 / 10:56 AM / Updated 25 minutes ago Cricket-Bangladesh's Shakib, Nurul fined following Friday fracas Reuters Staff 2 Min Read COLOMBO, March 17 (Reuters) - Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan and reserve player Nurul Hasan have been fined 25 percent of their match fees and handed one demerit point each for code of conduct breaches during Friday’s ill-tempered Twenty20 international against Sri Lanka. Ugly scenes unfolded during the closing stages of Bangladesh’s successful run chase when play was briefly halted as the tourists remonstrated about two shoulder-high balls at the start of an eventful final over from Isuru Udana. A furious Shakib was seen gesturing from the boundary to batsmen Mahmudullah and Rubel Hossain to come off the field after the second bouncer was not called a no-ball. Nurul, who had entered the playing area carrying a team message, was seen pointing at Sri Lanka captain Thisara Perera. Shakib was found guilty of “conduct that is contrary to the spirit of the game”, while Nurul displayed “conduct that brings the game into disrepute”, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said in a statement on Saturday. “Friday’s incidents were disappointing as you don’t want to see such player behaviour during any level of cricket,” match referee Chris Broad said. “I understand that it was a tense and an edge-of-the-seat match with place in the final on the line, but the actions of the two players were unacceptable and cannot be condoned as they clearly went overboard. “Had the fourth umpire not stopped Shakib and the fielders remonstrating, and then the on-field umpires not intervened between Nurul and Thisara, things could have become worse.” Mahmudullah smashed a six off Udana’s fifth delivery to secure a thrilling two-wicket victory and a place in Sunday’s tri-series final against India.
