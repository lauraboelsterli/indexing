    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said that rules for governing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin were likely to be introduced on a country-by-country basis before any international push.\nThe Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, speaks to the Scottish Economics Forum, via a live feed, in central London, Britain March 2, 2018. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls “These are national issues. I suspect they will remain national issues for some time,” Carney, who is also chair of a global financial regulation body, the Financial Stability Board, said on Friday.\n“I would have greater expectation of a series of national steps rather than some big coordinated approach,” he said in response to a question after delivering a speech on the future of crypto-currencies.\nWriting by William Schomberg; Editing by Andy Bruce\n ",
