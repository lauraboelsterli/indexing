GM and Boeing heavily use metals, so tariffs on steel and aluminum could adversely impact their businesses.\nNetflix — Analysts at Stifel downgraded the streaming giant's stock to \"hold\" from \"buy,\" citing its recent appreciation in value. \"We are attracted to Netflix's business and competitive position but believe share price may have sprinted ahead of fundamentals in the short-term,\" the analysts said.\nAmerican Outdoor Brands , BlackRock — American Outdoor Brands, known for manufacturing Smith & Wesson guns, defended their safety efforts in a letter to asset manager BlackRock, its largest shareholder. \"The solution is not to take a politically motivated action that has an adverse impact on our company, our employees, our industry, … but results in no increase in public safety,\" the letter said.\nRoss Stores — The off-price retailer reported quarterly earnings and revenue that beat analysts' expectations.
