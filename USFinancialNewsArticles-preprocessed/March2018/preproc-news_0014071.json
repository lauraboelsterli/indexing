    "text": "WASHINGTON, March 7 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that China has been asked to develop a plan to reduce its trade imbalance with the United States.\n“China has been asked to develop a plan for the year of a One Billion Dollar reduction in their massive Trade Deficit with the United States,” Trump wrote in a post on Twitter, mistakenly referring to a deficit where Beijing runs a surplus.\n“We look forward to seeing what ideas they come back with,” Trump wrote.
