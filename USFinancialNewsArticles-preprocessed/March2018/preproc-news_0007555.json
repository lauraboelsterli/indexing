    "text": "OAKLAND, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- DASAN Zhone Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ: DZSI or the \"Company\"), a global leader in fiber access transformation for enterprise and service provider networks, today reported its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nRevenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $68.6 million compared to $66.4 million for the third quarter of 2017 and $59.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenue for the fiscal year 2017 was a record $247.1 million compared to the $150.3 million for fiscal year 2016.\n\"As I reflect on 2017, I am proud that it has been such a watershed moment for us from a focus and execution perspective, and also as importantly, from a financial perspective. We generated record high quarter and annual revenue and are seeing tremendous platform benefits from the combination of Dasan Network Solutions and Zhone Technologies,” said Yung Kim, CEO of DASAN Zhone Solutions, Inc. “The thesis behind the merger of building a world-class, global communications equipment leader with greater scale, faster speed to innovation, and enhanced product portfolio is playing out very well.”\nNet income attributable to DASAN Zhone Solutions, Inc. for the fourth quarter of 2017, calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), was $4.2 million or $0.26 per share compared with net income of $1.4 million or $0.09 per share for the third quarter of 2017 and net loss of $6.3 million or a loss of $0.38 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted earnings before stock-based compensation, interest income (expense), net income tax provision (benefit), and depreciation and amortization, and merger related costs (“adjusted EBITDA”) was $2.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $2.7 million for the third quarter of 2017 and a loss of $3.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\n\"2017 has been a turning point for the Company from a profitability perspective. We turned profitable in 2017 from an operating income, adjusted EBITDA, and net income perspective as we benefited from the platform benefits as a combined company,” said Michael Golomb, CFO of DASAN Zhone Solutions, Inc. “I am highly encouraged that we achieved a record level of profitability on an adjusted EBITDA basis in the fourth quarter as we continue to be extremely focused on growing revenue on a profitable scale.”\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017 were $17.5 million compared to $17.9 million at December 31, 2016.\nDASAN Zhone Solutions, Inc. will conduct a conference call and audio webcast to discuss further details of its fourth quarter 2017 results at approximately 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday, February 28, 2018. This call is open to the public by dialing +1 (888) 306-9369 for U.S. callers, and +1 (503) 406-4059 for international callers, and then providing passcode 5797437. The audio webcast will be simultaneously available on the Investor Relations section of DASAN Zhone Solution's website at http://www.dasanzhone.com/about/investor-relations/investor-events/ .\nA replay of the conference call will be available after the original call by dialing +1 (855) 859-2056 for U.S. callers, and +1 (404) 537-3406 for international callers and then entering passcode 5797437. An audio webcast replay will also be available online at http://www.dasanzhone.com/about/investor-relations/investor-events/ for approximately one week following the original call.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement DASAN Zhone's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, DASAN Zhone uses adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure DASAN Zhone believes is appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of DASAN Zhone's past financial performance and prospects for the future. These adjustments to GAAP results are made with the intent of providing greater transparency to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. These non-GAAP results are among the primary indicators that management uses as a basis for making operating decisions because they provide meaningful supplemental information regarding the Company's operational performance, including the Company's ability to provide cash flows to invest in research and development, and to fund capital expenditures. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between net income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA is provided in a table immediately following the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) below.\nAbout DASAN Zhone Solutions\nDASAN Zhone Solutions, Inc.
