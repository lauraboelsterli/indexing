REUTERS/Stoyan Nenov “Already today, fourteen member states have decided to expel Russian diplomats,” Tusk told a news conference in the Black Sea city of Varna.\n“Additional measures, including further sanctions within the common EU framework, cannot be excluded in the coming days and weeks,” he said.\nReporting by Alissa de Carbonnel, writing by Gabriela Baczynska\n ",
