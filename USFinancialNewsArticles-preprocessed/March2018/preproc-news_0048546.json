    "text": "LONDON, March 27 (Reuters) - Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg will not answer questions from British lawmakers over a scandal in which the social media network let millions of usersâ€™ data get into the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, The Telegraph newspaper and the BBC reported.\nZuckerberg will instead send his Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer or Chief Product Officer Chris Cox to appear before the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport committee.\nThe committee, which had asked for Zuckerberg or someone senior from Facebook to appear, was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Reuters.
