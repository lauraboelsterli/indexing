Houses are seen in London, Britain January 19, 2017. REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth \nHouse prices rose 2.1 percent in the year to March compared with 2.2 percent in February, weaker than all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists that had pointed to growth of 2.6 percent. \nPrices fell on the month by 0.2 percent, following a 0.4 percent drop in February - again undercutting all forecasts in the Reuters poll that had pointed to growth of 0.2 percent. \nNationwide said it expected house prices would be broadly flat over 2018, with a marginal gain of around 1 percent over the year as a whole.
