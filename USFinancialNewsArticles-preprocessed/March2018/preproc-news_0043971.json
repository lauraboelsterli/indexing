FILE PHOTO: A Louis Vuitton logo, part of LVMH luxury group, is pictured on a building in Geneva, Switzerland, November 23, 2017. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse Abloh takes over from Kim Jones, who was last week named as the new designer of menswear at Christian Dior, another LVMH label. Abloh’s first men’s collection for Vuitton will be presented in June, the firm said. The overhaul at Dior and Vuitton coincides with reshuffles elsewhere at LVMH, as billionaire boss Bernard Arnault seeks to breathe new life into some labels and lift others to a new level by expanding product lines.
