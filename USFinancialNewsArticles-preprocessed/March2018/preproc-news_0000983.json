    "text": "SAN DIEGO, March 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- EdgeWave®, Inc., a leading provider of cybersecurity solutions, announced today the addition of three new IT and security veterans to its ranks. The new team members bring expertise and energy to the company's strategic market position. These experts will help EdgeWave further the company's growth in email and web security, and set the stage for additional cybersecurity innovation. Early traction and adoption of ThreatTest is surging and EdgeWave is rapidly growing to address the increasing demand.\nAnita Boghoussian joins EdgeWave as their new vice president of sales. Boghoussian brings more than 20 years of experience in the IT and cybersecurity industries and was previously a senior director with Dassault Systèmes, providing sales enablement, coaching, mentoring and structuring in the North American market. She has also held senior roles in sales at Websense, Panda Security, and Sun Microsystems.\nGang Ding joins EdgeWave as the director of engineering. He will lead the company's development and innovation of network content filtering and cybersecurity products. Before joining EdgeWave, Ding was the director of engineering at ZitoVault, overseeing next-gen endpoint and IoT security solutions, and also served in engineering roles at Qualcomm, Olympus Communication Technology of America and Kiyon.\nAron McGrane joins EdgeWave as the director of customer success. McGrane has more than 15 years of experience in technical support, holding previous positions with Forcepoint and Websense. His appointment enhances EdgeWave's customer service program and strengthens the company's commitment to securing clients from malicious network intrusions.\n\"As businesses and government organizations struggle to balance risk, usability and price in their fight against ever-increasing cyber threats, we at EdgeWave are accelerating our efforts to mitigate those risks and reduce costs and complexity through products like ThreatTest,\" says EdgeWave CEO Lou Ryan. \"A big part of this effort includes hiring these three outstanding executives. We're excited to utilize their talents as part of our strategic growth in 2018.\"\nThe new executive hires follow the launch of EdgeWave ThreatTest, an automated phishing email incident response service that empowers end users to seamlessly report suspicious emails for threat investigation, in real-time, with the click of a button. Using machine learning and human analysis, ThreatTest rapidly delivers the results of the threat investigation directly to the employee, indicating whether or not it's safe to open the email. If a threat is detected, ThreatTest globally removes the malicious message from the inbox and notifies IT administrators.\nAbout EdgeWave, Inc.\nEdgeWave is a leader in the cybersecurity industry, delivering innovative, effective and efficient email and web security protection for thousands of business and government organizations.
