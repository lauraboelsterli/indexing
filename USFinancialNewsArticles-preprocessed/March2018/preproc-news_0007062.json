    "text": "SÃO PAULO—Brazil’s economy returned to growth in 2017 after two years of contraction, as investment spending, agriculture and industrial production helped pull the country out of its worst recession on record. \nGross domestic product expanded a seasonally adjusted 0.1% in the fourth quarter from the third, and grew 1.0% during 2017, Brazilian statistics agency IBGE said Thursday. GDP increased 2.1% in the fourth quarter of 2017 from the same period a year earlier. \n ",
