    "text": "0 COMMENTS In 1981, at the age of 6, Apricot Irving is uprooted to Haiti by her missionary parents. For this child of Southern California, the Caribbean island is enchanting: the green-throated lizards, the mango trees, the sea as warm as bathwater, the music. It is also terrifying, a place where the hospital is so overcrowded that doctors must choose which patients to save, where drought, starvation and military coups weave an endless tapestry of suffering. Nine years later she finds herself striving, with help from Creole songs and upside-down chickens, to convey this teeming, contradictory world to her parents’ church supporters back home. In “The Gospel of Trees,” Ms. Irving, who returned to Haiti in 2010 to cover the earthquake for the radio program “This American Life,” tries again to tell her story of the island.\nThe Gospel of Trees By Apricot Irving\nSimon & Schuster, 373 pages, $26\nMost stories of missionaries, Ms. Irving writes, fall into predetermined narratives: “hagiography or exposé; the Sunday school version or ‘Lord of the Flies.’ ” This memoir eschews all such categories. We watch the author’s idealistic parents fail time and again and yet still deliver redemptive slide shows to drum up funding for the mission, their determination to do good unwavering. (“In church circles . . . being a missionary was almost as good as being a movie star.”) Ms. Irving observes the dynamics of race and privilege—how a Haitian child surrenders his tricycle to a blan (white child), how the missionary culture, for all its altruism, breeds hierarchies, political complicity, and resentment.\nEpisodes from Haitian history are interspersed throughout—from Columbus’s fateful landing in 1492 to the slave trade and the deforestation that has impoverished the island. (“Each year more soil erodes from the barren hills,” she writes, “like flesh slipping from bones.”) But the book is most powerful when it is most personal, and when it grapples with the ethical uncertainties of aid work: Is saving others worth the cost of bringing suffering upon your own family? Should the Irvings keep trying, even if they’re doomed to fail? Even if their presence is unwanted? For Ms. Irving, the missionary task of bringing God’s light to poor Haiti comes to feel absurd. “God was already here,” she concludes. “Maybe our only job was to bear witness to the beauty—and the sorrow. Without denying either one.”\n—Ms. Winkler, formerly of the Economist, is a writer for the Journal’s “Heard on the Street” column.",
