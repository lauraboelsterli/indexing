    "text": "March 9, 2018 / 1:28 PM / Updated an hour ago Brazil's Suzano re-confirms tie-up talks with Fibria shareholders, says issues remain Reuters Staff 1 Min Read SAO PAULO, March 9 (Reuters) - Brazilian pulp producer Suzano Papel e Celulose SA and the controlling shareholders of rival Fibria Celulose SA, who are in talks regarding a potential tie-up, still need to address structural and financial issues during negotiations, Suzano said on Friday. The statement came in response to a report in local newspaper Valor Economico, which said the two parties were close to announcing a merger. Suzano said that given the issues that remain in the talks, it was “not possible to confirm the veracity of the news.” Fibria reiterated in a filing released shortly after that its controlling shareholders, BNDES Participações SA and Votorantim Industrial SA, were in negotiations with Suzano.
