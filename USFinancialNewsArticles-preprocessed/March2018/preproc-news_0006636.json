REUTERS/Jane Lee The overarching theme of the new fund, pronounced “ten-one-hundred”, will be to invest in real estate, ecommerce and emerging innovation in China and India, Kalanick said in a tweet.\nThe fund will oversee for-profit investments as well as non-profit work and focus on education and future of cities, Kalanick said. ( bit.ly/2Fqtq3M )\nTwitter was abuzz with speculation behind the meaning of the new fund’s name.\nOne user suggested that it could be a reference “Googol” or “10 to the power 100.”\nKalanick was not immediately available to respond to additional queries regarding his new venture.\nKalanick, co-founder the San Francisco-based ride hailing startup Uber, resigned in June under pressure from investors after a string of setbacks.\nReporting by Subrat Patnaik in Bengaluru; editing by Diane Craft\n ",
