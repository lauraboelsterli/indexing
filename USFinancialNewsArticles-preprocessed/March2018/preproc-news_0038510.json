Her team has also requested a meeting with the Federal Trade Commission. \nThe EU justice chief plans to question officials about the consent decree Facebook signed as part of a 2011 settlement with the FTC over concerns revolving around the social-media company’s privacy policies, according to an EU official. Under the settlement, Facebook pledged to obtain users’ explicit consent before their information could be shared. Ms. Jourová will ask her counterparts whether the FTC is planning any enforcement action related to the matter, according to the EU official.",
