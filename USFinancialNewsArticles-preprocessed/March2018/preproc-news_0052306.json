    "text": "March 30, 2018 / 12:52 AM / Updated 14 hours ago Baseball: Yankees new Murderers' Row hammer Blue Jays in opener Steve Keating 3 Min Read \nTORONTO (Reuters) - The New York Yankees new “Murderers’ Row” provided the opening day fireworks many expected with an explosive 6-1 win over the Toronto Blue Jays on Thursday that will have sent a shudder through Major League Baseball pitching staffs. Mar 29, 2018; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; New York Yankees right fielder Aaron Judge (99) celebrates the win with New York Yankees left fielder Brett Gardner (11) at the end of the Toronto Blue Jays home opener at Rogers Centre. The New York Yankees won 6-1.

Mandatory Credit: Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY Sports \n“We knew it was tough to go through them before Stanton showed up,” said Toronto manager John Gibbons. “I guess if you are going to be in a new city that’s the way to open it up. \n“They can do a lot of damage up top, you’ve got to pitch them tough, you can get them out if you pitch them tough but they can also burn you a time or two.” \nStanton led the assault, cracking a first inning two run homer in his first at bat in the Yankees pinstripes then closed out the scoring with a ninth inning solo shot.
