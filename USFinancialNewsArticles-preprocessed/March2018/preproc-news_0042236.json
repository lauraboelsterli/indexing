The tech giant also expects greater uncertainty in the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panel business due to stiffer competition between OLED and liquid crystal display (LCD) panels, and from Chinese LCD makers, Samsung Electronicsâ€™ co-CEO Kinam Kim said. Samsung held its annual shareholders meeting on Friday, with shareholders to vote on a 50:1 stock split and appointments of new board directors. Reporting by Joyce Lee; Editing by Stephen Coates",
