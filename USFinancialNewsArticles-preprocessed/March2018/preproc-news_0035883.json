There he developed a national accounts sales and marketing plan that identified and expanded vertical markets while growing the OEM sales channel by over 150 percent. Prior to this, Mr. Becker co-founded Holy Spirits, LLC (Milwaukee, WI) where he secured capital investment, established supplier and distribution agreements, and developed and implemented the marketing model, tools, collaterals, and processes for the company. Earlier, Mr. Becker served as the general manager and director of sales and marketing for SPX Dock Products (\"SPX\"), TKO Doors Division (Sussex, WI / Dallas, TX). At SPX he had full P&L responsibilities, with direct reports from operations, engineering, and sales.

He will also serve on the Company's senior leadership team and as Dutchland's chief spokesperson.\n\"It's a great honor to become part of the Dutchland team,\" said Mr. Becker. \"The Company is coming off a tremendous year with no signs of letting up. I look forward to accelerating the team's initiatives while continuing to deliver the highest quality products to our customers.\"\nDutchland, which manufactures cutting-edge products for customers across industry lines, is the third largest contract rotational molder in the United States.

The move will create an additional 42 jobs in the Empire State.\n\"Throughout his career, Jody has proven himself as someone who can consistently deliver on customers needs,\" said Peter Kirchof, chairman of the Dutchland Board. \"Whether leading marketing transformations or strategic sales initiatives, his work has been exemplary.
