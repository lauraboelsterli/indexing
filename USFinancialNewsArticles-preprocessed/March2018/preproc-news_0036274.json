    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Latest on efforts in Congress to reach a deal on a $1.3 trillion spending bill (all times local):\n4:45 p.m.\n  and top congressional Democrats remain shy of an agreement to put language into a government spending bill to protect many young immigrants from deportation.\nA White House official and a Senate Democratic aide say the White House has offered a two-and-a-half-year extension of President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. In exchange, the White House wants $25 billion for Trump's proposed border wall with Mexico and other security measures.\nDemocrats say for that amount, DACA recipients and people who might qualify for the program must get more: a chance at citizenship.\nDACA lets immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children stay temporarily and get jobs. Trump halted the program last fall.\nThe aides spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose private talks.\n— Jill Colvin\n2:40 p.m.\n  has told two Republican senators that he supports adding proposals to a huge spending bill that would provide billions in federal subsidies to insurers to help curb health care premium increases.\nTwo congressional sources said Trump offered that support in a Saturday call with GOP Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Maine's Susan Collins.\nAlexander and Collins are among Republicans who want to restore federal payments to insurers that Trump halted last fall that reimburse them for reducing out-of-pocket costs for lower-earning customers. They'd also create a $30 billion, three-year program to help carriers afford to cover their sickest, most expensive clients.\nBoth proposals are in peril. Democrats oppose GOP language forbidding the federal money from being used to finance abortions.\nThe sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the call publicly.\n—By Alan Fram.\n1:55 p.m.\nCongressional Democrats have rejected a White House bid to extend protections for so-called Dreamer immigrants in exchange for $25 billion in funding for  's long-sought U.S.-Mexico border wall.\nThe development came as talks continued on a massive $1.3 trillion catchall spending bill.\nAides said efforts to use the measure as a vehicle to extend protections for young immigrants under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival, or DACA, appeared likely to fail.\nTrump killed the Obama-era program in September, but a court decision has essentially left it in place, for now.\nThe White House Sunday proposed a 30-month extension of DACA protections in exchange for $25 billion for Trump's border wall — but Democrats demanded protections for a broader pool of immigrants.\nThe aides required anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly about the ongoing talks.\n12:51 a.m.\nCongressional leaders and the White House are pressing to strike an accord on a $1.3 trillion catchall spending bill.\nStanding in the way are disputes over immigration, abortion and a massive New York-New Jersey rail project that pits   against his most powerful Democratic adversary, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\nAn agreement by Monday would pave the way for a House vote on Wednesday. Action is needed by midnight Friday to avert another government shutdown.\nThe measure carries political and policy victories for both sides. Republicans and Trump are winning a long-sought budget increase for the Pentagon while Democrats obtain funding for infrastructure, the opioid crisis and a wide swath of domestic programs.\nCoupled with last year's tax cut measure, it heralds the return of trillion-dollar budget deficits.",
