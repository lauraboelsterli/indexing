    "text": "BERLIN, (Reuters) - Growth in Germany’s private sector slowed in February from a month earlier but is still on track for solid expansion in the first quarter, a survey showed on Monday.\nThe famous skyline with its banking district is pictured in early evening next to the Main River in Frankfurt, Germany, January 19, 2016. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach Markit’s final composite Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), which tracks the activity in manufacturing and services that together account for more than two-thirds of the economy, eased to 57.6 in February from 59.0 in January, reaching a three-month low.\nThe reading compared with the flash composite reading of 57.4.\nService providers took their most optimistic view of the outlook for business activity in seven years.\nA sub-index monitoring the services sector fell to 55.3 in February, also hitting a three-month low.\nMarkit economist Phil Smith said two first two months of 2018, taken together, had seen a faster average rate of private- sector growth than the final quarter of 2017.\n“Although Germany’s Composite PMI pulled back from January’s near seven-year high, the private sector remains on course for another robust expansion in the first quarter of 2018,” he said.\nWriting by Paul Carrel, editing by Larry King\n ",
