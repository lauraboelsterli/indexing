At the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company had approximately $6.3 billion of assets under management As of December 31, 2017, the Company had corporate cash of $35.4 million\nINVESTMENT IN RED HOSPITALITY & LEISURE\nSubsequent to quarter end, the Company acquired an approximate 80% controlling interest in RED Hospitality & Leisure for approximately $1 million in cash. RED Hospitality & Leisure is a leading provider of watersports activities and other travel & transportation services in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\nINVESTMENT IN J&S AUDIO VISUAL\nOn November 1, 2017, the Company acquired an 85% controlling interest in a privately held company that conducts the business of J&S Audio Visual in the United States, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic (\"J&S\") for approximately $9.2 million in cash, $4.3 million of Ashford common stock, and $9.5 million in assumed debt (excluding transaction costs, working capital adjustments, and contingent consideration).\nJ&S provides an integrated suite of audio visual services, including show & event services, hospitality services, creative services, and design & integration, making J&S a leading single-source solution for their clients' meeting and event needs. J&S currently has multi-year contracts in place with approximately 64 hotels and convention centers in addition to regular business representing over 2,500 annual events and productions, 500 venue locations, and 650 clients. J&S currently has contracts in place with only nine hotels owned by Ashford's advised REIT platforms.\nSince the Company's investment in November through the end of the year, revenues have increased 22% and Adjusted EBITDA has increased by approximately $690,000 over the prior year period.\nPURE ROOMS UPDATE\nThe Company currently owns a 70% controlling interest in Pure Rooms.

Next, the platform has gained further traction internationally with the creation of OpenKey China, a JV agreement with startup accelerator Plug and Play.

Also, the office in Guadalajara, Mexico has been instrumental for growth in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Colombia.

The number for this interactive teleconference is (719) 325-2454. A replay of the conference call will be available through Friday, March 9, 2018, by dialing (719) 457-0820 and entering the confirmation number, 8382398.\nThe Company will also provide an online simulcast and rebroadcast of its fourth quarter 2017 earnings release conference call. The live broadcast of the Company's quarterly conference call will be available online at the Company's web site, www.ashfordinc.com on Friday, March 2, 2018, beginning at 12:00 p.m. ET. The online replay will follow shortly after the call and continue for approximately one year.\nIncluded in this press release are certain supplemental measures of performance which are not measures of operating performance under GAAP, to assist investors in evaluating the Company's historical or future financial performance. These supplemental measures include adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA\") and Adjusted Net Income. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income provide investors and management with a meaningful indicator of operating performance. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income, among other measures, to evaluate profitability and our board of directors includes these measures in reviews to determine quarterly distributions to stockholders. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA by subtracting or adding to net income (loss): interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, net income (loss) to noncontrolling interests, transaction costs, and other expenses. We calculate Adjusted Net Income by subtracting or adding to net income (loss): net income (loss) to noncontrolling interests, transaction costs, and other expenses. Our methodology for calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies, when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies. Neither Adjusted EBITDA nor Adjusted Net Income represents cash generated from operating activities as determined by GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to a) GAAP net income (loss) as an indication of our financial performance or b) GAAP cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity nor are such measures indicative of funds available to satisfy our cash needs. The Company urges investors to carefully review the U.S. GAAP financial information as shown in our periodic reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, as amended.\nAshford provides global asset management, investment management and related services to the real estate and hospitality sectors.\nFollow Chairman and CEO Monty Bennett on Twitter at www.twitter.com/MBennettAshford or @MBennettAshford.\nAshford has created an Ashford App for the hospitality REIT investor community.
