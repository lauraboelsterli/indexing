    "text": "Chris Kirkham Alexandra Berzon \nSteve Wynn may seek to sell all or part of his 12% stake in Wynn Resorts Ltd. following the invalidation of a stockholder agreement that had prevented him from disposing of the stake, according to a company filing, potentially setting off a scramble to control the casino company. \nThe agreement had also prevented co-founder Elaine Wynn, Wynn’s ex-wife, from selling her 9% stake. The agreement was dissolved after Elaine Wynn and Steve Wynn agreed Wednesday to scrap it, Wynn Resorts WYNN, +0.99% said in the Thursday filing. \n“Mr. Wynn may seek to sell all or a portion of the Common Stock controlled by him pursuant to one or more registered public offerings, in the open market in transactions...or in privately negotiated transactions,” the company said, adding that Wynn would conduct any such sales “in an orderly fashion and in cooperation with the Company.” \nThe company’s current market capitalization is about $19 billion. \nWynn resigned last month as the chairman and chief executive of the casino operator after a Wall Street Journal article in January detailed allegations that he engaged in sexual misconduct against employees.",
