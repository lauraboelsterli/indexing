    "text": "New leader will speak on March 22 webinar\nCHARLOTTE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PeraHealth, an innovative provider of predictive, real-time clinical surveillance solutions, has appointed Virginia healthcare professional Thomas Flynn as Vice President of Account and Clinical Services.\nFlynn brings more than 20 years of experience in emergent, acute, post-acute, and ambulatory care delivery systems. A hallmark of his leadership practice is developing collaborative relationships with other leaders to implement strategic improvement initiatives.\nAt PeraHealth, Flynn will lead account management and clinical services and report directly to Chief Customer Officer Carolyn Scott. He will foster trusted partnerships and ensure customers experience excellent satisfaction with PeraHealth solutions. In short order, he will expand PeraHealth’s offerings for proactive patient surveillance and safety services that integrate with the company’s suite of solutions and also prepare the account management function to broaden operations, given business-wide growth projections.\n“We are excited to have Thom’s unique blend of clinical, analytics, and leadership experience to expand our professional services to address the quality, safety, and interdisciplinary communication needs of our customers in new ways,” says Scott.\nFlynn has presented nationally on topics including value-based purchasing, clinically-integrated approaches to quality, cost and efficiency, and specific clinical areas such as reducing pressure ulcers. Over the last three years, he has led integrated consulting and informatics teams that have achieved customer-validated savings in excess of $100 million and have produced a variety of quantifiable improvements in mortality, readmissions, and hospital-acquired infections.\nOn March 22, 2018, from 2-3 p.m. ET, Flynn will speak on PeraHealth’s free webinar, “The Evolution of the Rothman Index: Report Out on Results of the Top Clinical Deterioration Algorithm.” For nearly 10 years, the scientific team behind the Rothman Index (RI) has been constantly validating the algorithm that is PeraHealth’s clinical gold standard in helping clinicians detect patient deterioration earlier. Register\n“In my experience leading quality improvement initiatives, a recurring challenge has been implementing predictive models that proactively identify patient deterioration and safety concerns,” says Flynn. “PeraHealth’s research-based solutions easily complement traditional improvement strategies and integrate with electronic health records. I’m inspired by the PeraHealth team’s dedication and passion to make solutions easy for hospitals to use.”\nFlynn comes to PeraHealth from Premier, Inc., where he led integration of quality consulting services and developed performance improvement solutions for CMS value-based purchasing programs. He has a Six Sigma Black Belt from the Juran Institute and earned a Master of Science in Nursing, Leadership and Management from Walden University and a Bachelor of Science in Nursing from William Paterson University.\nAbout PeraHealth\nPeraHealth is transforming healthcare through the intelligent use of data. PeraHealth solutions, powered by the Rothman Index, provide a visual representation of the patient’s condition and progress in real time. Leading hospitals and health systems use PeraHealth predictive analytics to improve quality and reduce cost.
