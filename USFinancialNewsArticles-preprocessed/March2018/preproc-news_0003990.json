    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abattis Bioceuticals Corp. (the \" Company \" or \" Abattis \") (CSE:ATT) (OTC:ATTBF) is pleased to announce it has officially rebranded itself as a one-stop provider of downstream cannabis solutions for licensed producers (“ LPs ”) and manufacturers of cannabinoid-containing products. The Company’s new focus on downstream solutions reflects several of its recent acquisitions and the success of its fully integrated services offerings. These offerings now include biomass production, federally-licensed research and development and analytical services, regulatory services, logistics support for the manufacture, sale, distribution and marketing of cannabinoid-containing finished products and cannabinoid delivery products and blockchain-based peer-to-peer payment technologies.\n\"We intend for the rebranding to consolidate our recent acquisitions and pave the way for exciting new partnerships in the future,\" stated Rob Abenante, President and CEO of Abattis. “For example, our recent acquisition of Gabriola Green Farms will round out our supply chain, providing us and our partners with integrated services spanning from biomass production to the manufacture of high-end cannabis extracts,” added Mr. Abenante.\n“While continuing to develop our in-house nanotechnology delivery platforms, we hope to support our partners in multiple aspects of their businesses, from helping them increase manufacturing and distribution capacity to, in the case of established brands, guiding their entry into the cannabis space. Our suite of integrated services will also address our partners’ future needs, providing comfort that they will be able to adapt once legalization arrives this summer,” further stated Mr. Abenante.\n\"Abattis’s wide range of downstream services allows it to add value and ensure regulatory compliance for its partners, while assisting the development of their functional foods and beverages, cosmetics, veterinary and over-the-counter health products, to name a few,” added Dr. David Galvez, Senior Science Advisor at Abattis.\nRecent Developments\nGabriola Green Farms\nOn March 2, 2018, the Company announced that it had acquired a 90% ownership interest in Gabriola Green Farms Inc. (“ Gabriola Green Farms ”), an LP applicant located on Gabriola Island, one of the gulf islands located in the Strait of Georgia off the coast of British Columbia.\nBy becoming the majority-shareholder of Gabriola Green Farms, Abattis intends to secure access to cannabis biomass for its extraction and manufacturing activities with respect oils, resins and isolates. These added value products could be used as stand-alone applications or as active ingredients for current and new finished products.\nGreen Tree Therapeutics\nOn January 25, 2018, the Company announced that it had acquired Green Tree Therapeutics Corporation (“ Green Tree ”), the owner of a successful brand of vaporizers sold in more than 130 medical and recreational stores across North America. Green Tree’s products will soon be available through Abattis’s wholly-owned subsidiary Vergence Naturals Ltd. Abattis’s acquisition of Green Tree will allow the Company to directly pair and distribute cannabinoid-containing oils and extracts with Green Tree’s line of vaporizers.\nCannaNUMUS\nOn February 8, 2018, the Company announced that it had acquired a 49% stake in CannaNUMUS Blockchain Inc. (“ CannaNUMUS ”). Abattis’s investment in CannaNUMUS has already reached two significant milestones by securing an investment agreement with Active Health Products Ltd. and acquiring a 10% stake in Gabriola Green Farms.\nWith this acquisition, Abattis has gained the ability to offer blockchain-based peer-to-peer payment services to cannabis merchants, a market segment not been currently served by traditional financial institutions. Abattis believes that its investment in CannaNUMUS will appreciate significantly in value as CannaNUMUS gets closer to an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) and enters into agreements with other LPs and late stage LP applicants.\nCollaboration with UBC on Nanotechnology\nOn February 12, 2018 the Company announced the sponsorship of a research study in partnership with Mitacs to explore the development of nanoemulsified and liposomal platforms for transmucosal delivery of cannabinoid-rich hemp oil. The research and development work is being led by scientists from Abattis and the Faculty of Land and Food Systems at the University of British Columbia (“ UBC ”).\nThrough this collaboration, Abattis hopes to develop a proprietary technology that could be applied to the manufacture and distribution of high-end nanoemulsified cannabinoid-rich oils with enhanced absorption and bioavailability. These oils could be used to create safe and stable premium foods and beverages and could be used in cosmetics and veterinary applications.\nAbout Abattis Bioceuticals Corp.\nAbattis is a life sciences and biotechnology company which aggregates, integrates, and invests in cannabis technologies and biotechnology services for the legal cannabis industry developing in Canada.
