A view shows the Russia's Central Bank headquarters in Moscow, Russia February 22, 2018. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin The central bank, which is widely expected to trim its key rate from 7.5 percent at a board meeting next Friday, said inflationary risks have declined as annual inflation slowed to an all-time low of 2.18 percent in February. In a regular report on market trends, the central bank also warned that so-called “trade wars” pose risks to global economic growth and the stability of financial markets.
