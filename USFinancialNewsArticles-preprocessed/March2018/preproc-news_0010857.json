Why do I have to spend 80 hours going over my emails that I’ve had with (former Trump adviser) Steve Bannon and with (Trump associate) Roger Stone,” Nunberg told MSNBC.“Why does (Special Counsel) Bob Mueller need my emails when I send Roger and Steve clips and we talk about how much we hate people.” Reporting by Lisa Lambert and David Alexander; Editing by Tim Ahmann",
