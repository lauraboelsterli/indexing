    "text": "0 COMMENTS Amid all the Brexit brouhaha about why consumer-goods giant Unilever UL -2.06% chose Rotterdam over London for its legal base, investors shouldn’t forget the bigger question: Why did the maker of Dove soap and Hellmann’s mayonnaise choose at all?\nThe decision to decide dates back to Unilever’s “strategic review” last April, which was an explicit reaction to Kraft Heinz’s short-lived $143 billion takeover bid . The trauma of becoming a target convinced Unilever’s management that it needed flexibility to shake up its portfolio of consumer brands. Its dual-headed structure, with the equity base split between the U.K. and the Netherlands, was an obstacle to major deals.\nThis is particularly true in the U.S. If Unilever used its stock to bid for Colgate-Palmolive —an oft-cited target—Colgate’s shareholders wouldn’t, under Unilever’s current structure, be able to roll their capital gains into an investment in the European group.\nSelling off assets will also be easier to manage with a single set of shareholders. Unilever might have got more than $8 billion for its margarine business last year if a spinoff to shareholders had been a more convincing alternative to a sale.\nHellmann's owner Unilever has chosen to locate its headquarters in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, rather than London. Photo: Uncredited/Associated Press Further asset disposals seem a more likely outcome than a big acquisition. A less centralized corporate structure also announced Thursday makes the food business easier to sell—to Kraft Heinz, for example. And Unilever would struggle to justify using its stock, trading for 18 times earnings, to buy Colgate’s, trading for 22 times, at a time when the toothpaste giant’s growth has been weaker.\nSome may see an ulterior motive for moving the headquarters: to protect Unilever itself from a takeover. Dutch law is better than British law at thwarting outsiders, as evidenced by paint giant PPG’s failed efforts to buy Dutch rival Akzo Nobel last year. But these fears seem overblown. Unilever is abolishing the Akzo-style “trust office” associated with its Dutch holding company and maintaining its U.K.-style board structure.\nMore deals, not fewer, should spring from Unilever’s move.\nWrite to Stephen Wilmot at stephen.wilmot@wsj.com",
