    "text": "March 30, 2018 / 4:20 AM / Updated 5 hours ago Gracia wants Doucoure to fulfil European dream at Watford Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Watford midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure has been linked with a move to a top-six club at the end of the season but manager Javi Gracia says the Frenchman is already playing at a big club and can fulfil his European ambitions at Vicarage Road. Soccer Football - Premier League - Liverpool vs Watford - Anfield, Liverpool, Britain - March 17, 2018 Watford's Abdoulaye Doucoure in action with Liverpool's Virgil van Dijk Action Images via Reuters/Lee Smith \nDoucoure has made 30 Premier League appearances and scored seven goals in the current campaign, and British media have credited Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool and Arsenal with an interest in the player, who said earlier this season it would be a dream to play in Champions League. \n“Doucoure is playing for a very big team, playing in the Premier League and in the future I would like him to play with Watford in Europe,” Gracia told reporters. \n“Maybe in the future he can play with other big clubs who play in the Champions League.” \nGracia said he was pleased with Doucoure’s attitude in the final stretch of the season despite the uncertainty surrounding his future. \n“Doucoure knows he is important, not for me, but for the club and his team mates,” the manager added. \n“I am only focused on the next seven games and I am sure Doucoure will help us with his best attitude until the end of the season. Then we will see what happens, but I would like for him to stay with us for a long time.” \nWatford sit 11th in the league ahead of Saturday’s game against Bournemouth, who are a place above them on goal difference.
