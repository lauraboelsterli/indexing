In 2016, 1,865,000 migrants arrived in Germany and 1,365,000 people emigrated, the office said. The swell of migrants arriving in 2015, many fleeing war in the Middle East, helped fuel the rise of the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which surged into parliament for the first time at last year’s national election. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s new coalition government, which is due to take office on Wednesday, has pledged to manage and limit migration to Germany and Europe to prevent a repeat of the 2015 refugee influx.
