    "text": "2 Hours Ago | 01:02 \nShares of General Electric dropped below $13 in Monday trading. \nIn the absence of positive news, the company's stock fell as far as $12.86, the lowest level since July 2009. Pressure on GE has not let up this year, with the stock sliding more than 25 percent. A dismal 2017 saw company shares slide 42 percent. \nGE lagged far behind the rest of the Dow Jones industrial average , which surged 650 points Monday with Microsoft the best-performing stock in the index. \nA Wall Street Journal report Sunday looked into what investors truly know about the risks lurking within GE Capital's portfolio. The report said the unit still has assets it has been unable to sell, with the added possibility GE may be held liable for some assets it unloaded since the 2008 financial crisis. \nThe report also noted the conglomerate continues to use commercial paper, a type of short-term debt. Historically, extensive use of commercial paper caused GE to burn through funds in 2008. The WSJ found GE's average commercial paper balance was $17.3 billion during the most recent quarter. \nIn the midst of a restructuring effort, GE recently nominated three new directors , as it looks to downsize its board. show chapters ",
