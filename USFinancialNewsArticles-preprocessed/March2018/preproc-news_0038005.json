    "text": "Asset Management Solution Addresses Medical Device Cyber Risks\nAUSTIN, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Accruent , the world’s leading provider of physical resource management solutions, has acquired California-based Connectiv, enhancing Accruent’s ability to meet the needs of clients in healthcare. This marks Accruent’s seventh company acquisition in the past twenty-four months to help clients have control and visibility across asset management solutions.\nConnectiv is a rapidly-growing cloud-based, mobile-enabled software company that allows biomedical and clinical engineering groups to manage and control all aspects of their medical devices and equipment. Connectiv software helps healthcare organizations fulfill their mission by mitigating risk, ensuring regulatory compliance and maximizing utilization. Connectiv is a ServiceNow® Technology Partner automating the management of medical applications, devices and facilities.\n“With 67% of medical device manufacturers and 56% of healthcare providers believing an attack on their devices is likely to occur within a year, we saw the urgency to provide a solution for managing biomedical assets,” said John Borgerding, CEO, Accruent. “We are acquiring Connectiv because their software, co-created with clinical engineers in national healthcare organizations, enables management of medical devices across the lifecycle, including automatic security monitoring that identifies threats in minutes. Connectiv’s biomedical asset management solution has the feature set and the flexibility to address changing healthcare needs, new technologies and regulatory demands.”\nWith hospitals and clinical providers looking for the user-friendliness and control of a master IT platform, Connectiv leverages the proven reliability of the widely adopted Now Platform™ from ServiceNow, Inc., enabling more powerful automated management across clinical applications and medical assets.\n“Healthcare IT adoption is growing at a rapid rate across our platform,” stated Avanish Sahai, Global Vice President, ISV, Industry and Technology Alliances, ServiceNow. “Working together, Accruent and Connectiv will bring new ways to manage healthcare assets to clients.”\n“Connectiv is a fast-to-scale company, and we’ve built our business and platform to meet the underserved needs of healthcare clinical engineers,” said Rob Woodbyrne, CEO, Connectiv. “Since our founding, we’ve brought more transparency to healthcare organizations as they manage technology and optimize the delivery of healthcare. Now, as part of the global Accruent team, we’re primed to build on a well-established base to achieve rapid global expansion.”\nThe acquired solution set and its planned enhancements will continue serving existing Connectiv customers, and will be offered as a complement to Accruent’s existing suite of healthcare solutions in asset and maintenance management, lease accounting, and capital planning. The acquisition, effective immediately, includes the continuation of existing Connectiv product development, support and sales resources.\nAbout Accruent\naccruent.com , @accruentllc\nAccruent is a global software company that helps organizations achieve superior performance by transforming how they manage their physical resources.
