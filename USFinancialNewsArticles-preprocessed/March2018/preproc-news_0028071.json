The fourth quarter shortfall was directly attributable to sales declines at two key retailers; one reflecting a storewide reduction of inventory weeks on hand and the other due to two 2016 promotions that were not repeated in 2017. In addition, we decided not to fulfill orders due to credit concerns at two other retailers.\n“We believe the changes we have made in our U.K. operations, including combining Kitchen Craft and Creative Tops and closing our Netherlands operations, will create operating efficiencies and enable each business effectively to leverage the other’s traditional customer base, thereby resulting in significantly improved results for 2018.\n“Our recent acquisition of Fitz and Floyd, with its popular assortment of tabletop products and decorative ceramic collections, added to fourth-quarter sales in our Tableware division. As we expected, Fitz and Floyd was accretive to our 2017 results.\n“Inventory levels at December 31, 2017 declined, reflecting a company-wide effort eliminate less productive SKU’s as part of an ongoing effort to improve our inventory turns.\n“As noted above, the U.S. Tax Reform Act that was signed into law in December had a significant effect on reported tax expense. The impact of the change in the law increased our tax expense for the quarter by $3.3 million. Of this amount $3.0 million was a non-cash charge to adjust deferred taxes. The balance of $300 thousand is our current estimate of the U.S. tax owed on previously unremitted foreign earnings and will be paid over eight years. The overall impact of the Tax Reform Act is quite favorable to us, and excluding further one-time charges related to the Tax Act, will reduce our effective tax rate beginning in 2018.”\nRobert Kay, Lifetime's Chief Executive Officer, added,\n“As Lifetime’s new CEO, I am excited to be working with Jeff and the combined Lifetime and Filament team to drive value creation through growth and increased efficiencies. We have just brought together two industry leaders that represent innovation, execution and best in class capabilities in sales, marketing, design, creative, finance and operations. During our first quarter earnings report, we will provide a roadmap laying out our strategy and guidance for the full year 2018. This will include a discussion of ongoing initiatives such as Lifetime Next as well as the implementation of over $8 million of cost savings resulting from the Filament merger, which closed on March 2 nd .”\nDividend\nOn Thursday, March 8, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.0425 per share payable on May 15, 2018 to shareholders of record on May 1, 2018.\nConference Call\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call for Thursday, March 15, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. The dial-in number for the conference call is (844) 787-0801 or (661) 378-9632, passcode #4479898.

A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statements of income, balance sheets, or statements of cash flows of the Company; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. As required by SEC rules, the Company has provided reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are provided because management of the Company uses these financial measures in evaluating the Company's on-going financial results and trends, and management believes that exclusion of certain items allows for more accurate comparison of the Company’s operating performance. Management uses this non-GAAP information as an indicator of business performance. These non-GAAP measures should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, GAAP measures of performance.\nForward-Looking Statements\nIn this press release, the use of the words “believe,” \"could,\" \"expect,\" \"may,\" \"positioned,\" \"project,\" \"projected,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"would\" or similar expressions is intended to identify that represent the Company’s current judgment about possible future events.
