Girard Avenue, a mixed-use property featuring 15 new build apartment units above a street-level commercial space occupied by Sherwin Williams. The 14,500 square-foot property is located in the heart of Fishtown, one of Philadelphia’s hottest neighborhoods for millennials and young professionals.\n“As a firm, we seek to invest in boutique properties within major metropolitan areas that will offer a new and desirable experience for tenants, align with major market trends and deliver long-term value for our investors,” said Larry Botel, founding partner of JOSS Realty. “This property features 15 beautiful apartments in an ideal location, and we believe that 18-20 W.

Girard Avenue.\nWithin Philadelphia, JOSS Realty has also invested in 1701 South St., a mixed-use property with nine apartments and a ground-floor commercial space; and East Market, the 4.3 acre project that is transforming the city block between Market and Chestnut, 11 th and 12 th Streets.\nAbout JOSS Realty Partners\nJOSS Realty Partners is a private owner/operator focused real estate investment management firm headquartered in New York City.
