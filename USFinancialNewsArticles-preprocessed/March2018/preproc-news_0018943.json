    "text": "LJUBLJANA, March 8 (Reuters) - Shares in Slovenia’s Gorenje jumped by almost 9 percent on Thursday after the household appliances maker announced it had received four non-binding bids from Asia to form a strategic partnership.\nThe shares were up 9 percent at 5.60 euros at 1158 GMT.\nGorenje declined to provide further details. It plans to update on the process on March 15.\nThe company is expected to allow one or more bidders to perform due diligence before filing a binding bid.\nLast year, Gorenje, one of Slovenia’s largest exporters, said it was seeking a strategic partner to improve cost efficiency and strengthen the brand.\nJapan’s Panasonic, which had looked at making a takeover bid for Gorenje, decided against the idea in November 2016. It owns almost 11 percent of the company.\n$1 = 0.8082 euros Reporting by Marja Novak; editing by Jason Neely\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
