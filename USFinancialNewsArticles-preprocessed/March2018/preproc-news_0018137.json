    "text": "Fourth quarter revenue grew to $3.7 million while full-year 2017 revenue more than doubled over prior-year to $15.6 million Tool Revenue was largest growth driver in the quarter and year, up 48% and 93%, respectively; Contract Services revenue nearly doubled in the quarter and tripled in the year Generated $2.4 million in cash from 2017 operations\nVERNAL, Utah--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Superior Drilling Products, Inc. (NYSE American:SDPI) (“SDP” or the “Company”), a designer and manufacturer of drilling tool technologies, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nTroy Meier, Chairman and CEO of Superior Drilling Products, noted, \"We made excellent progress in 2017, growing significantly, generating cash and demonstrating the strength of our business model. We believe our flagship Drill-N-Ream ® (DnR) wellbore conditioning tool is proving out its value proposition that it deserves to be on every well and we expect our Strider TM oscillation system technology will be another leading technology for the oil & gas drilling industry. We continue to focus on the development of new technologies, making improvements in our manufacturing processes and supply chain while building a strong, reliable team that can execute our strategy for growth.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Summary\n($ in thousands,except per share amounts) Q4 2017 Q4 2016 $Y/Y\nChange\n% Y/Y\nChange\nQ3 2017 $ Seq.\nChange\n% Seq.\nChange\nTool sales/rental $ 1,434 $ 1,451 $ (17) (1.2)% $ 2,012 $ (578) (28.7)% Other related tool revenue 1,224 342 882 257.9% 1,171 53 4.5% Tool Revenue 2,658 1,794 864 48.2% 3,183 (525) (16.5)% Contract Services 1,072 539 533 98.9% 1,264 (192) (15.2)% Total Revenue $ 3,730 $ 2,333 $ 1,397 59.9% $ 4,447 $ (717) (16.1)% Operating income (loss) (670) (2,213) 1,543 NM 720 (1,389) (193.1)% As a % of sales NM NM 16.2% Net income (loss) $ (786) $ (2,614) 1,829 NM $ 586 (1,372) (234.0)% Diluted earnings (loss) per share $ (0.03) $ (0.11) $ 0.08 NM $ 0.02 $ (0.05) (224.2)% Revenue increased $1.4 million, or 60%, over the prior-year period to $3.7 million from growth in both Tool Revenue and Contract Services. Sequentially, revenue was down 16% which was in-line with expectations as exhausted customer annual budgets typically result in a slowing of activity into year-end.\nTool Revenue was $2.7 million in the quarter, an increase of $0.9 million, or 48% over the prior-year period. The growth was driven by a 258% increase to $1.2 million of Other related tool revenue, which is comprised of royalty, maintenance, and repair fees. The growth reflects the benefit of increased recurring revenue associated with the growing rental fleet deployed in the marketplace. Tool sales/rental were essentially unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was mostly the result of the initial rental fleet ramp-up process which was still underway by the channel partner in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nContract Services revenue was $1.1 million, which essentially doubled from the prior-year period and far outpaced the 57% year-over-year increase in average U.S. rig count in the quarter as the Company continues to support drill bit refurbishment beyond its contracted area and provide other contract manufacturing services.\nNet loss was $786 thousand compared with net loss of $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Included in net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was a $.6 million bonus expense in lieu of stock (see Operational Review). Included in the net loss for the fourth quarter of 2016 were pre-tax asset impairment charges of $1.1 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA (see NOTE 1), or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock compensation expense and unusual items, grew to $791 thousand compared with\n$49 thousand in the prior-year period from the strength in revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA declined from $1.8 million in the trailing third quarter on lower sequential volume from seasonality combined with year-end compensation items and spending associated with the Middle East expansion and increased engineering costs associated with the commercialization of Open Hole Strider.\nNOTE 1: The Company believes that when used in conjunction with measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, helps in the understanding of its operating performance. See the attached tables for important disclosures regarding SDP’s use of adjusted EBITDA, as well as a reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Operational Review\n($ in thousands) Q4 2017 Q4 2016 $ Y/Y\nChange\n% Y/Y\nChange\nQ3 2017 $ Seq.\nChange\n% Seq.\nChange\nCost of revenue $ 1,571 $ 1,167 $ 405 34.7% $ 1,717 (145) (8.5)% As a percent of sales 42.1% 50.0% 38.6% Selling, general & administrative $ 1,897 $ 1,627 $ 270 16.6% $ 1,102 795 72.1% As a percent of sales 50.9% 69.7% 24.8% Depreciation & amortization $ 931 $ 912 $ 19 2.1% $ 908 24 2.6% Impairment of property, plant and equipment - held for sale $ - $ 840 $ (840) (100.0)% $ - - NM Total operating expenses $ 4,400 $ 4,546 $ (146) (3.2)% $ 3,727 $ 673 18.1% Cost of revenue as a percentage of sales decreased from 50.0% to 42.1%, primarily a result of higher volume, increased productivity, and improved mix as it relates to royalties and maintenance.\nSelling, general and administrative expense (SG&A), which includes research and engineering, declined over the prior year period, but increased sequentially due to increases in engineering costs related to the Strider TM technology products, spending related to the Company’s expansion into the Middle East, and a $587,500 bonus expense in lieu of stock paid to the founders which would have otherwise vested over 3 years. The founders used the bonus to pay principle and interest on the Tronco note receivable which was reduced to $7.4 million at the end of 2017. The note receivable is currently over collateralized with 8,267,860 shares and 530,725 restricted stock units.\nOperating loss was $669,800. On an adjusted basis (non-GAAP), the operating loss was $82,300 excluding consideration of the founders’ bonus expense.\nFull Year 2017 Review\n($ in thousands,except per share amounts) 2017 2016 $\nChange\n%\nChange\nTool Revenue $ 10,597 $ 5,483 5,114 93.3% Contract Services $ 4,998 $ 1,670 3,328 199.3% Total Revenue $ 15,595 $ 7,153 8,442 118.0% Cost of revenue 5,960 4,492 1,469 32.7% As a % of sales 38.2% 62.8% Selling, general & administrative 5,734 5,776 (41) (0.7)% As a % of sales 36.8% 80.7% Depreciation & amortization 3,677 4,291 (615) (14.3)% Operating expenses 15,371 14,559 812 5.6% Impairment of property/goodwill - 840 Total operating expenses 15,371 15,399 Operating income (loss) 225 (8,246) 8,471 102.7% Net loss $ (279) (9,129) 8,850 96.9% Diluted loss per share $ (0.01) $ (0.48) 0.47 97.9% Revenue for 2017 increased 118% over 2016 to $15.6 million, driven by market share growth and stronger market conditions with a 72% increase in the U.S. rig count. Tool revenue of $10.6 million increased 93%, or $5.1 million, from the prior-year period. Tool revenue was comprised of $6.7 million in tool sales/rental and $3.9 million in other related revenue. Contract Services revenue almost tripled to $5.0 million when compared with the prior-year period.\nDuring the year, the Company continued to gain market share with its DnR tool, made significant strides in validating the performance of our Strider TM technology products, continued to strengthen relationships with important contract services customers, and entered a Middle East market development agreement with a well-established international partner.\nOperating income for the year was $224,500. Excluding the founders’ bonus expense, operating income was $812,000, or 5.2% of sales. Net loss was $279,000, or $0.01 per diluted share in 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA (see NOTE 1) was $5.0 million, compared with an adjusted EBTIDA loss of $1.5 million in 2016, from higher revenue, improved mix, operational and efficiency improvements, and cost discipline. See the attached tables for important disclosures regarding SDP’s use of adjusted EBITDA, as well as a reconciliation of net income to adjusted EBITDA.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nCash generated by operations was $2.4 million in the year. At December 31, 2017, cash and equivalents was $2.4 million.\nTotal debt at the end of the year was $12.8 million, down $3.9 million, or 23%, compared with $16.7 million at December 31, 2016.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company had capital expenditures of $90 thousand. For the year, capital expenditures were $936 thousand compared with $353 thousand in 2016.\nOutlook and 2018 Guidance\nMr. Meier, added, “2018 is looking to be another exciting year for SDP as we expect another year of strong growth. We are in the process of evaluating the market share achievement of our DnR channel partner for the end of 2017, and are in conversations about our plans and expectations for 2018. We have a very strong partner and expect that they can meet or exceed the 17.5% market share requirement by the end of 2018. Although still in market development evaluation stages, we are really encouraged with the performance of the DnR in the Middle East and expect that to be another growth area in the latter half of 2018 and beyond. In addition, we have the Strider TM product line being requested and see this tool as another large future opportunity for SDP. Not losing sight of our legacy business, we are finalizing discussions with our drill bit refurbishment customer and anticipate that in the end we will be in a much better position while helping our customer succeed.”\nFinancial estimates for 2018 are expected to fall in the following ranges:\nRevenue: $18 million to $22 million Operating margin: 5% to 10% Interest Expense: Approximately $750 thousand Depreciation and Amortization: Slightly under $4.0 million Capital Expenditures: Approximately $1 million Webcast and Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call and live webcast today at 9:00 am MT (11:00 am ET) to review the financial and operating results for the quarter and discuss its corporate strategy and outlook.

The Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important supplemental measure of operating performance and uses it to assess performance and inform operating decisions. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a GAAP financial measure. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be used as a substitute for GAAP measures of performance, including net cash provided by operations, operating income and net income. The Company’s method of calculating Adjusted EBITDA may vary substantially from the methods used by other companies and investors are cautioned not to rely unduly on it.

Adjusted income from operations is not a measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, commonly known as GAAP and may not be comparable to the measures as used by other companies. Nevertheless, the Company believes that providing non-GAAP information, such as adjusted income from operations, is important for investors and other readers of the Company’s financial statements and assists in understanding the comparison of the current quarter’s and current year's income from operations to the historical periods' income from operations, as well as facilitates a more meaningful comparison of the Company’s net income and diluted EPS to that of other companies.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180308005359/en/\nInvestor relations:\nKei Advisors LLC\nDeborah K.
