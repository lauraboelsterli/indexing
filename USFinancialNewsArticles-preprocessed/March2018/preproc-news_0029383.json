    "text": "WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif., March 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Guitar Center, Inc. (the “Company”) today announced that its indirect wholly owned subsidiary Guitar Center Escrow Issuer, Inc. (the “Issuer”) has priced $635 million in aggregate amount of 9.500% senior secured notes due 2021 at an issue price of 98.140% (the “Notes”). The Notes are being offered to “qualified institutional buyers” (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”)) in a private placement (the “Notes Offering”), in reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and certain non-U.S. persons outside the United States in accordance with Rule 902 under the Securities Act. The Notes Offering is expected to close on March 16, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. Following satisfaction of conditions including the completion of the Company’s exchange offer and consent solicitation relating to the Company’s 9.625% Senior Notes due 2020 (the “Exchange Offer”), the Issuer will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with borrowings under the Company’s $375.0 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the “ABL Facility”), to (i) redeem all of the Company’s outstanding 6.500% Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (including accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date) and (ii) pay fees and expenses related to the Notes Offering, the Exchange Offer and an amendment and extension to the ABL Facility.\nThe Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 or the securities laws of any state and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any security, nor shall there be any sale of the Notes or any other security of the Company, in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.\nAbout Guitar Center\nGuitar Center is a leading retailer of musical instruments, lessons, repairs and rental instruments in the U.S. With more than 280 stores across the U.S. and one of the top direct sales websites in the industry, Guitar Center has helped people make music for more than 50 years.
