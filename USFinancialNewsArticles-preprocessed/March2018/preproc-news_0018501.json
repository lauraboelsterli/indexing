    "text": "Many people are bringing work into bed with them. \nMore than 40 percent of professionals report they often lose sleep because they can't get their job off their minds, according to a survey of 2,800 people by global staffing firm Accountemps. \n\"If you're not sleeping, you're going to have lower productivity, health issues and work-life balance issues,\" said Bill Driscoll, district president of Accountemps. \nThe most common work-related issue disrupting people's slumber is an overwhelming feeling about their job's responsibilities or hours.\nMany people also say they stay up fixating on a business problem or worrying about their relationships with their co-workers. Some people say it's a fear of being fired that leaves them staring at the ceiling. Others blame their boss for their sleeplessness. \nNearly 60 percent of young people (between the ages of 18 and 34) report losing sleep over work, compared with just 29 percent of people over the age of 55. And women are less likely to let work keep them up (40 percent) than men (50 percent). \nshow chapters Sleep Factor      11:59 AM ET Tue, 23 Jan 2018 | 05:20 The study also found that people in Miami, Nashville and New York are more likely to stay up in the wee hours thinking about work. Meanwhile, people in Cleveland, Philadelphia and Minneapolis seem to sleep more soundly, sans preoccupations of bosses and deadlines. \nWhat you can do  An hour before you plan to sleep, make a physical list of the problems at work that are causing you stress, said Dr. Chris Winter, author of \"The Sleep Solution: Why Your Sleep is Broken and How to Fix It.\"\n\"Most people's fears are out of their control and somewhat irrational. Technically, we're all in danger of being fired,\" Winter said. \"Seeing them on paper can help significantly to put them in perspective.\" \n\nResist the urge to jump on your laptop at 3 a.m. and start \"putting out fires,\" Winter said. Your work in those hours is unlikely to be your best and \"the light from the computer and stress will condition you to awaken.\" \nTry to realize the issues on your list that can be addressed, he said. \nIf you're worried that you might be fired, for example, have an updated resume that you are proud of along with a plan of action in your arsenal.\nMake time for co-workers if you feel those relationships could benefit from strengthening. \"If you have too much work,\" Winter said, \"tell your boss it's too much for one person.\" \nMore from Personal Finance:\nPutting bitcoin in your IRA can sink your retirement\n5 key differences between Roth and traditional IRAs\nThis rollover mistake can sink your retirement savings",
