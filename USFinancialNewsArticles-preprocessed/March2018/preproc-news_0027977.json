(NYSE:MVC) (the Company), a publicly traded business development company (BDC) that makes private debt and equity investments, announced its financial results for the fiscal first quarter ended January 31, 2018.\nOperational Highlights:\nNAV increased to $13.42 per share as of January 31, 2018, compared to $13.24 per share as of October 31, 2017. Made two new yielding investments totaling $11.2 million. Invested $3.7 million in a secured note issued by Essner Manufacturing at a variable interest rate of between 10.5% and 11.5% over the life of the loan that matures on December 20, 2022. Invested $7.5 million in a secured note issued by Black Diamond Equipment Rental at a 12.5% interest rate and received a warrant. The loan matures on June 27, 2022. Made three follow-on investments totaling $3.4 million. Invested $1.5 million in a senior secured loan (to be used for new equipment) to U.S. Spray Drying Holding Company at a 12% interest rate that matures on November 7, 2020. Invested $526,000 into Initials, Inc., increasing the senior secured subordinated loan to $5.3 million at the same 15% interest rate and maturity date of June 23, 2020. Loaned $1.4 million to Turf Products, LLC as a third lien loan at a 10% interest rate and maturity date of August 7, 2020 to support a small recapitalization of the business. Received principal repayments of $3.0 million from Dukane IAS, LLC and $200,000 from Vestal Manufacturing Enterprises, Inc. Restructured financing of Custom Alloy Corporation (“Custom Alloy”).\nFollowing the quarter-end, the Company committed $6.0 million to Custom Alloy as a first lien special project loan at a 10% interest rate that matures on August 31, 2018. FDS, Inc. repaid its $2.4 million loan in full, including all accrued interest. (See “Subsequent Events” below).\nFinancing & Other Capital Activities\nCompleted a public offering of 6.25% senior notes due November 30, 2022 with net proceeds to the company of $111.4 million, resulting in anticipated savings of $1.9 million over the life of the notes 1 . Redeemed all outstanding 7.25% senior notes due 2023 for $114.4 million. The 6.25% senior notes and 7.25% senior notes were outstanding simultaneously for 36 days. This overlap in borrowings between the raising of the 6.25% notes and the redemption of the 7.25% notes increased one-time interest expense by approximately $800K. Also, with the redemption of the 7.25% notes, the unamortized deferred financing fees of $1.8 million were expensed at the time of repayment. The unamortized deferred financing fees are a non-cash, one-time expense. Excluding these extraordinary costs, operating expenses would have been approximately $2.6 million less than reported. Acquired 2,293,577 shares of its common stock at $10.90 price per share (at an aggregate cost of $25 million) via a modified “Dutch Auction” Tender Offer. The NAV accretion of $0.28 per share is reflected in the NAV per share as of January 31, 2018.\n1 $1.9 million in savings is calculated as the differential in interest expense between the 6.25% senior notes and the 7.25% senior notes over the five year term of the 6.25% notes, net of estimated offering fees and expenses.\nFinancial Results\nQuarter Ended (Unaudited) ($ in thousands except for per share data) Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Q3 2017 Q2 2017 Q1 2017 Total operating income 5,207 5,490 7,305 3,929 3,380 Management fee 1,411 1,335 1,393 1,696 1,814 Portfolio fees - asset management 147 148 146 138 177 Management fee - asset management 67 67 67 49 62 Administrative 1,295 983 804 1,172 1,474 Interest, fees and other borrowing costs 3,117 2,495 2,649 2,606 2,538 Loss on extinguishment of debt 1,783 - - - - Net incentive compensation 267 (1,224 ) 5,077 985 760 Total waiver by adviser (390 ) (372 ) (386 ) (461 ) (491 ) Tax expense 0 1 0 0 1 Net operating (loss) income before net realized and unrealized gains (2,490 ) 2,057 (2,445 ) (2,256 ) (2,955 ) Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations 950 (4,028 ) 23,906 3,069 4,377 Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations per share 0.05 (0.17 ) 1.06 0.14 0.19 Net asset value per share 13.42 13.24 13.38 12.45 12.45 Key Financial Metrics\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company earned $4.3 million in interest income and $891,000 in dividend and fee income, compared to $2.8 million and $609,000, respectively, for the same quarter of fiscal 2017.\nThe Company reported total operating income of $5.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to total operating income of $3.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017.
