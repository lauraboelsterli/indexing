    "text": "0 COMMENTS OSAKA, Japan— Nintendo Co. NTDOY -1.52% is looking to peripherals to lift the sales pace of its Switch videogame console in the product’s second year on the market rather than changing its basic hardware, say people familiar with the company’s plans.\n\nPeople enjoy making Nintendo Labo at a hands-on demonstration event in Osaka. The product hits the market in April. Photo: Takashi Mochizuki/The Wall Street Journal \nSaturday will mark a year since the Switch went on sale. Cumulative sales are set to reach 17 million by March 31, beating initial expectations , and Nintendo Chief Executive Tatsumi Kimishima has said he wants to sell more than 20 million units in the new fiscal year that begins April 1.\nThe company has high hopes for its Nintendo Labo cardboard toy kit, which goes on sale in April and is aimed at attracting parents looking for an educational toy for their children. The kits contain cardboard pieces that can be assembled into pianos, cars, robots or other toys that work with the Switch hardware and use it as a brain.\nThe Labo is one of the steps planned by Nintendo to lure a wider range of customers . Company data shown to investors suggest current Switch owners are mostly game fans drawn by Nintendo titles such as “Super Mario Odyssey” and “The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.”\nSome parents interviewed at an electronics store in Osaka said they hesitated to give their children videogames—but would take a closer look at the Labo as it’s more like a crafts project. \n\nGame enthusiasts and industry personnel play the Switch in the Nintendo exhibit during the Electronic Entertainment Expo E3 in Los Angeles last June.

It allows users to reprogram how their input—such as the shake of a controller—affects the output, creating odd situations like using a cardboard fishing rod to steer a car.\nAyumu Sugita, who teaches physics at Osaka City University, attended a Nintendo event with his 10-year-old daughter, who likes working with crafts and drawing. The Labo kit “is interesting from the physics point of view. For example, the car doesn’t have wheels but translates the Switch controller’s vibration into a force to move forward and backward,” he said.\nThe people familiar said expanded Switch features in the coming year could also include additional network-related features and peripherals to be attached to its USB Type-C port. \n\nPeople line up to get their hands on the Switch at an electronics store in Tokyo last year. Feverish demand for the console has led to short supply. Photo: Toru Hanai/Reuters \nBut they said changes to the Switch itself—like a smaller version of the machine—were unlikely this year as Nintendo focuses on better manufacturing and shipping of the current model. \nIn its first year, the Switch was frequently in short supply , and procuring key components remains a challenge.\nAt an investor briefing in February, Mr. Kimishima, the Nintendo CEO, said he wanted to make the Switch’s product cycle longer than the five-to-six-year span that’s become customary in the videogame console industry. One person familiar with development plans said waiting longer to introduce variations in the hardware would serve that purpose.\nWrite to Takashi Mochizuki at takashi.mochizuki@wsj.com",
