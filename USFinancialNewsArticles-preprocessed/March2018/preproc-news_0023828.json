    "text": " 31 p.m. ET Share \nAttacks similar to deadly bombing on March 2 Reuters An FBI agent arrives at the scene of an explosion in Austin, Texas, on Monday. \nBy Dan Frosch \nTwo separate package bombs killed a teenage boy and injured two others in Austin, Texas, on Monday, authorities said. \nThe explosions follow a third package bomb that killed another man on March 2 in Austin, and police were looking into whether the incidents were linked because both individuals killed by the explosions were African-American. \nAt a news conference, Austin Police Chief Brian Manley said a resident retrieved a package left on their doorstep Monday morning, went inside the kitchen and opened it. The package then exploded, killing a 17-year-old boy and leaving a woman with non-life-threatening injuries. \nManley said the U.S. Postal Service doesnâ€™t believe that package was sent through its service. Police said that incident was similar to the deadly March 2 explosion, and that both involved packages left on the doorsteps of homes in the morning. Later Monday, another package explosion left a woman with potentially life-threatening injuries, authorities said.",
