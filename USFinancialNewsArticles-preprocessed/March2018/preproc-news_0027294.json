(NYSE:ADT) today reported the results for its fourth quarter and full year 2017. The Company also provided guidance for 2018 and declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.035 per share.\n“Our fourth quarter results reflect a very strong finish to 2017. We grew revenue, EBITDA, and cash flow year-over-year, and we also meaningfully reduced customer attrition while improving customer acquisition efficiency. Following our initial public offering, we are excited about the future of ADT and our ability to drive significant cash flow growth as we continue to execute against our strategic objectives,” said Tim Whall, ADT’s Chief Executive Officer.\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 RESULTS\nThe Company reported total revenue of $1,106 million, net income of $638 million, and Adjusted EBITDA of $598 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nTotal revenue, which includes revenue generated from monitoring and related services (“M&S revenue”), installation and other revenue, was $1,106 million, up 5% over the prior year period. M&S revenue, which made up approximately 92% of total revenue in the quarter, was $1,012 million, up 2% over the same period last year. The growth in M&S revenue was driven by improvements in customer revenue attrition and higher average price. The remaining increase in total revenue was driven by higher outright sales and incremental amortization of deferred installation revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter totaled $598 million, an 8% increase over the prior year period. Growth in fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA was driven by the higher M&S revenue, lower net expense associated with subscriber acquisition costs (“SAC”), and efficiency improvements in operating costs, partially offset by investments in customer service improvements.\nThe Company reported net income of $638 million, up from negative $85 million last year, and diluted earnings per share of $0.99 versus $(0.13) in the prior year. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share was $(0.06) versus $(0.07) in the same period last year. The net income results include a $690 million tax benefit due to the 2017 Tax Reform.\nTrailing twelve-month gross customer revenue attrition for the quarter was 13.7%, an improvement of 110 basis points year-over-year, as the Company focused on higher quality customer additions and executed operational improvements to enhance customer service levels.\nTrailing twelve-month customer revenue payback, which measures how many years it will take the Company to recover, via new revenue, its net expenditures on customer acquisitions and installation costs, improved to 2.5 years compared to 2.7 years in the fourth quarter of 2016. The improvement was the result of more targeted marketing and sales expenditures, efficiencies in installation costs, and increased up-front installation revenue.\nOperating cash flow in the quarter was $330 million, up from $236 million from the same period last year. Free cash flow before special items was $22 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, up from negative $42 million in the same period last year. Fourth quarter 2017 cash net income totaled $76 million, an increase of $66 million over the prior year period. The year-over-year improvement in free cash flow before special items and cash net income was driven by EBITDA improvements, efficiency gains in SAC, and lower cash interest.\nFULL YEAR 2017 RESULTS\nOn a full year basis, the Company reported total revenue of $4,316 million and M&S Revenue of $4,029 million, up 4% and 2%, respectively, when compared to 2016 pro forma results. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $176 million, or 8%, to $2,353 million. Net income was $343 million, up from a net loss of $285 million, and diluted earnings per share of $0.53, up from $(0.44) last year. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share for the year was $(0.35) compared to $(0.20) in 2016. Operating cash flow was $1,592 million, up 39% year-over-year, and free cash flow before special items was $403 million, up from $331 million in 2016.\n“Beyond our strong financial performance, we fully integrated legacy ADT and Protection One field operations during 2017. We deployed tools and processes to drive operational performance and we strengthened our customer focused culture within our direct and dealer channels. Our strong performance is the result of the hard work from the men and women at ADT throughout our local offices and call centers across North America. I am proud that our entire organization, our employees and our dealer partners, are laser focused on serving our customers,” said Whall.\nCAPITAL STRUCTURE HIGHLIGHTS\nInitial Public Offering - On January 23 rd , 2018, the Company closed its initial public offering of 105 million shares of common stock, which generated gross proceeds of $1,470 million. The Company used these proceeds to redeem approximately $594 million of 2nd Lien Notes, to deposit $750 million into a segregated account for the purpose of redeeming the Koch Preferred Securities at a future date, and to pay related fees and expenses.\nQuarterly Dividend - On March 15, 2018, the Company’s board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.035 per share payable on April 5, 2018 to common stockholders of record on March 26, 2018.\nCapital Structure - Pro forma for our initial public offering and use of proceeds, including the redemption of the Koch Preferred Securities, the ratio of the Company’s net debt to trailing twelve-month Adjusted EBITDA implied net leverage of 4.1x as of December 31, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 totaled $123 million.\n2018 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK\nThe Company is providing the following financial guidance for 2018:\nTotal revenue between $4,450 million and $4,550 million Adjusted EBITDA between $2,415 million and $2,435 million Free cash flow before special items between $475 million and $525 million Gross customer revenue attrition between 13.0% and 13.3%\n(1) All variances are year-over-year unless otherwise noted. Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow before special items, Cash Net Income, net income or loss before special items, diluted earnings per share before special items, and net leverage ratio are non-GAAP measures. Refer to the “Non-GAAP Measures” section for the definitions of these terms and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures.\nMedia Inquiries: Investor Relations: Jason Shockley\ntel : 561.322.7235\njshockley@adt.com Jason Smith - ADT\nSloan Bohlen - Solebury Communications\ntel: 817.928.1646\ninvestorrelations@adt.com Conference Call\nManagement will discuss the Company’s fourth quarter and full year 2017 results during a conference call and webcast today beginning at 8:30 a.m. (ET).

These measures are not financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income, operating income, or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, and may not be comparable to a similarly titled measure reported by other companies.\nWe believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain non-cash items and about unusual items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future, as well as other items. Further, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides a meaningful measure of operating profitability because we use it for evaluating our business performance, making budgeting decisions, and comparing our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. We believe the presentation of Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to illustrate the effect that the ADT Acquisition had on our Adjusted EBITDA, assuming that such transaction took place on January 1, 2015.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss adjusted for (i) interest, (ii) taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, including depreciation of subscriber system assets and other fixed assets, amortization of dealer and other intangible assets, (iv) amortization of deferred costs and deferred revenue associated with subscriber acquisitions, (v) share-based compensation expense, (vi) purchase accounting adjustments related to fair value of deferred revenue under GAAP, (vii) merger, restructuring, integration, and other costs, (viii) financing and consent fees, (ix) foreign currency gains/losses, (x) loss on extinguishment of debt, (xi) radio conversion costs, (xii) management fees and other charges, and (xiii) other non-cash items.\nThere are material limitations to using Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA do not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense, and other adjustments which directly affect our net income. These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently, and by considering Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Adjusted EBITDA discussion above is also applicable to its margin measure, which is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of monitoring and related services revenue.\nWe define Free Cash Flow as cash from operating activities less cash outlays related to capital expenditures. We define capital expenditures to include purchases of property, plant, and equipment; capitalized costs associated with transactions in which we retain ownership of the security system; and accounts purchased through our network of authorized dealers or third parties outside of our authorized dealer network. Historical Combined Free Cash Flow is defined as cash from operating activities less cash outlays related to capital expenditures and reports, on a combined basis, the Historical Free Cash Flow results for the Company and The ADT Corporation, where applicable, for the periods presented. In arriving at Free Cash Flow and Historical Combined Free Cash Flow, we subtract cash outlays related to capital expenditures from cash from operating activities because they represent long-term investments that are required for normal business activities. As a result, subject to the limitations described below, Free Cash Flow and Historical Combined Free Cash Flow are useful measures of our cash available to repay debt, make other investments, and pay dividends. Historical Combined Free Cash Flow further adjusts for certain cash items that are consistent with adjustments included in the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA.\nFree Cash Flow adjusts for cash items that are ultimately within management’s discretion to direct, and therefore, may imply that there is less or more cash that is available than the most comparable GAAP measure. Free Cash Flow is not intended to represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures since debt repayment requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures are not deducted. These limitations are best addressed by using Free Cash Flow in combination with the GAAP cash flow numbers.\nCash Net Income is a non-GAAP measure that we present to provide additional information to investors about our operating performance. We define Cash Net Income as Adjusted EBITDA less (1) capitalized subscriber acquisition costs, (2) cash taxes, and (3) cash interest paid, including interest on our preferred securities. Given our capital intensive business model, high debt levels, and the fact we are a low cash income tax paying Company due to our significant net operating loss, the Company uses this measure to reflect the cash portion of such adjusted items mentioned above to further evaluate our operational performance. There are material limitations to using Cash Net Income. Cash Net Income does not take into account certain significant items, including depreciation and amortization, interest expense, income tax expense, and other adjustments which directly affect our net income. These limitations are best addressed by considering the economic effects of the excluded items independently, and by considering Cash Net Income in conjunction with net income or loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nDiluted EPS before special items is a non-GAAP measure that may be used from time to time and should not be considered a replacement for GAAP results. Diluted EPS before special items is defined as earnings per diluted share adjusted for (i) share-based compensation expense, (ii) purchase accounting adjustments related to fair value of deferred revenue under GAAP, (iii) merger, restructuring, integration, and other costs, (iv) financing and consent fees, (v) foreign currency gains/losses, (vi) loss on extinguishment of debt, (vii) radio conversion costs, (viii) management fees and other charges, (ix) other non-cash items, and (x) the impact these adjusted items have on the effective tax rate. The difference between net income or loss and diluted EPS before special items and net income or loss and diluted EPS (the most comparable GAAP measures) consists of the impact of the special items noted above on the applicable GAAP measure. The Company believes that diluted EPS before special items is one of several benchmarks used by analysts and investors who follow the industry for comparison of its performance with other companies in the industry, although our measure of diluted EPS before special items may not be directly comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. The limitation of this measure is that it excludes the impact (which may be material) of items that increase or decrease our reported operating income, operating margin, net income or loss and EPS. This limitation is best addressed by using the non-GAAP measure in combination with the most comparable GAAP measure in order to better understand the amounts, character and impact of any increase or decrease on reported results.\nThe leverage ratio may be presented as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to total debt. The leverage ratio is a useful measure of the Company’s credit position and progress towards leverage targets. Refer to the discussion on Adjusted EBITDA for a description of the differences between the most comparable GAAP measure. The calculation is limited in that the Company may not always be able to use cash to repay debt on a dollar-for-dollar basis.\nThe Company is not providing a quantitative reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial outlook to the corresponding GAAP information because the GAAP measures that we exclude from our non-GAAP financial outlook, other than those described above, are difficult to predict and are primarily dependent on future uncertainties. The GAAP measures excluded from our non-GAAP financial outlook for which we do not prepare a reconcilable GAAP forecast include the factors described above, where applicable.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nADT has made statements in this press release and other reports, filings, and other public written and verbal announcements that are forward-looking and therefore subject to risks and uncertainties.
