FILE PHOTO - Peru's President-elect Pedro Pablo Kuczynski (C), Vice-President Martin Vizcarra (R) and second Vice-President Mercedes Araoz attend a ceremony to receive presidential credentials from the National Elections Board in Lima, Peru, June 28, 2016. REUTERS/Janine Costa/File Photo Slideshow (2 Images) The motion, presented in a document seen by Reuters, was signed by 29 lawmakers while at least 87 votes would be needed to impeach Kuczynski. A previous effort to remove him in December came up short and Kuczynski denies wrongdoing. A vote on the new motion has not yet been scheduled.
