    "text": "RICHMOND, Va., March 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Iggbo, a fast-growing healthcare technology startup in Henrico, VA, announced today that it has changed its name to Workpath, refined its digital platform, raised $1.5 million in additional funding, and will move its office to Scott's Addition in Richmond. The company, now doing business as Workpath, was founded in 2015 with the goal of building technology that deploys mobile labor to perform healthcare services when and where they're needed most. Workpath will use the additional funds to continue to build technology that solves the problem of labor coordination and mobile workforce management in the healthcare industry.\n\"We build technology that enables any healthcare organization to automate the process of organizing, dispatching, tracking, and managing its labor to perform important services,\" said Eddie Peloke, CEO of Workpath. \"Along the way, our award-winning platform has evolved and can now be used to bridge gaps and create new efficiencies in a variety of complex industries in healthcare and far beyond.\"\nWorkpath will move its headquarters to 1717 Summit Avenue in Scott's Addition, where it will continue to build and refine its product. The Workpath platform allows healthcare customers to monitor their appointments, assign workers, track and manage teams in real time, follow up on any issues in the field, reschedule appointments, and systematically communicate with patients and customers about their services.\nWorkpath technology has been used to establish new efficiencies for its healthcare partners as they perform some of the industry's most critical and time-intensive services. Customers include national health systems, home health agencies, nursing organizations, specialty and reference laboratories, clinical trial operators, and insurance providers.\n\"Workpath is on a mission to simplify the complexities of mobile team management for healthcare customers and others in highly specialized industries,\" said Jillian Manus, managing partner at Structure Capital, a Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm that has invested in Workpath. \"Workpath provides the healthcare industry a new way to work smarter.\"\nStructure Capital and Heritage Group, which is backed by 15 of the nation's leading healthcare companies, have partnered with Workpath to grow the platform's ability to transform the way healthcare teams efficiently manage and track their mobile workforce.\n\"We continue to be enthusiastic about our partnership with Workpath and are energized by the impressive traction the company has made,\" said Graham Hunter, principal at Heritage Group. \"Healthcare labor providers will need to adapt and embrace the gig economy, especially if they want to stay relevant in the competitive labor market that exists today. Workpath's technology simplifies complexities in healthcare workforce management and equips labor providers with the tools necessary to operate with maximum efficiency.\"\nAbout Workpath\nWorkpath is on a mission to simplify the complexities of mobile workforce management.
