(OTC:AMMX), a provider of heavy equipment for logistics companies , infrastructure construction , and tactical military vehicles , reports results for its financial year ended December 31, 2017 and a brief overview of sales for the first quarter of 2018 ending March 31.\nHighlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2017:\nRevenue for 2017\nThe company reported revenue of approximately $8.8 million compared to revenue of approximately $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGross Profit for 2017 Increased 45 Percent\nThe company reported gross profit of $4.3 million compared to gross profit of $2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

They are now just finishing their review of the Company’s financial statements for the year ended December 2017 and will provide AmeraMex with any adjustments required. The Company plans to file the Registration Statement with the SEC as soon as possible. Then the SEC comment process will begin. The process can last three to four months, but the Company and its service providers are committed to responding expeditiously. After the SEC comment process is completed to their satisfaction, they will declare the Registration Statement “effective” and AmeraMex will be a “fully reporting company” which is a requirement before applying to list on the OTCQB.\nFirst Quarter 2018\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, AmeraMex has reported sales of over $6.9 million. Based on the current economic climate, management believes this positive outlook will continue to grow sales throughout 2018 and beyond.\nShareholder Conference Call\nAmeraMex International will provide a shareholder update March 30 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time.
