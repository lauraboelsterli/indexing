The December, 2017 special dividend was 7 cents per share.\nSIGNIFICANT PORTFOLIO GROWTH\nThe Corporation’s investment portfolio (the “Investment Portfolio”), as at December 31, 2017 increased by $111.5 million to approximately $555.8 million as compared to $444.3 million as at December 31, 2016 (net of the impairment provision of $5.70 and $4.46 million respectively).\nSHORT TERM PORTFOLIO WITH SIGNIFICANT ANNUAL TURNOVER\nIn 2017, the Investment Portfolio repayments totaled $262.1 million with new investments during the year totaling $374.8 million.

Profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 represents an annualized return on shareholders’ equity (based on the average of the month end shareholders’ equity in the quarter) of 8.58%, representing a return on shareholders’ equity of 705 basis points per annum over the average one year Government of Canada Treasury bill yield of 1.53%.\nPRUDENT IMPAIRMENT PROVISION\nManagement has always taken a proactive approach to loan impairment provision. This is a prudent approach to protecting the stability of dividends to shareholders in the event there are any future issues with any of the investments within the Corporation’s investment portfolio. The impairment provision was increased by $1,240,000 during 2017 to $5,700,000 as at December 31, 2017, and represents 1% of Corporation’s assets.\nINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO DETAILS\nDetails on the Corporation’s investment portfolio as at December 31, 2017 are as follows:\nTotal gross investment portfolio of $561,501,977, which is an 25% increase over December 31, 2016. Conventional first mortgages, being those first mortgages with loan to values less than 75%, comprise 76.1% of our total portfolio, and total conventional mortgages with loan to values under 75% comprise 86.3% of our total portfolio. Approximately 74% of the portfolio matures by December 31, 2018. The average face interest rate on the portfolio is 8.09% per annum. Regionally, the mortgage investment portfolio is diversified approximately as follows: Ontario (87%), Alberta (4%), Quebec (5%), and Other (4%).\nDIVIDEND AND SHARE PURCHASE PLAN\nThe Corporation has in place a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) and Share Purchase Plan that is available to its Shareholders. The DRIP allows participants to have their monthly cash dividends reinvested in additional shares. The Price paid per share is 97% (if the share price is higher than $14.10) of the weighted average trading price calculated five trading days immediately preceding each dividend date with no commission cost. Once registered with the Share Purchase Plan, participants have the right to purchase additional shares, totaling no greater than $12,000 per year and no less than $250 per month. Shareholders participating pay no commission.\nAbout the Corporation\nWhere Mortgage Deals Get Done ®\nThe Corporation, through its mortgage banker, Firm Capital Corporation, is a non-bank lender providing residential and commercial short-term bridge and conventional real estate financing, including construction, mezzanine, and equity investments.
