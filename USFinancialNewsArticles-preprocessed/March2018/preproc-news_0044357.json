FILE PHOTO - A Google Street View car is seen in a street in Madrid, Spain, May 29, 2017. REUTERS/Sergio Perez Junior home minister Hansraj Ahir did not give a reason for the decision - though Indian media reported in October that the defense ministry had raised security concerns. Google first asked the government if it could roll out the service in India through its Google Maps and Google Earth apps in 2015. Reporting by Malini Menon; Editing by Andrew Heavens",
