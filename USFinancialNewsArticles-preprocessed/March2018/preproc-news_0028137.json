In this role, his leadership responsibilities will span the manufacturing, supply chain, service and facilities organizations.\nMr. Barnhart joins Nanometrics from Cymer LLC, an ASML company, where he has served as senior vice president, global operations since 2010. His substantial operations experience in the semiconductor manufacturing industry began nearly 30 years ago, when he joined Applied Materials as a manufacturing manager in etch tool production. During his 17 years at Applied Materials, Mr. Barnhart served in various operational leadership roles throughout the company, including as chief operating officer of the etch products business group, managing director of corporate asset services, and strategic worldwide account operations general manager.
