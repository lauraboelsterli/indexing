    "text": "Following in the footsteps of George Clooney, Diddy, and Justin Timberlake, the Backstreet Boys are gearing up for their next big act: as tequila makers .\nDuring a recent interview with Tasting Table , the 90s boy band said it plans to come out with its own tequila, but that the group just needs to find a partner in Mexico.\nBy law, tequila can only be made in Mexico’s state of Jalisco, with the exception of a few nearby areas. In order for the Backstreet Boys to start selling their own, they’ll likely need to partner with an existing brand. From the sounds of things, it looks like that hasn’t quite happened yet. There’s no word on what the tequila would be called.\nTequila also isn’t the only new venture the band is interested in. The band filed documents on Feb. 9 to trademark the name ‘Backstreet Barbecue,’ presumably to open their own barbecue restaurant.\nThe band continues its Las Vegas residency this summer.",
