The reading in February was 0.4 percent from 0.2 percent in January. The data also showed the headline consumer price index also picked up to 0.1 percent year-on-year from -0.2 percent in the previous month. Greece had been in a protracted deflation mode since March 2013 based on its headline index, as wage and pension cuts and a protracted recession took a heavy toll on Greek household incomes.
