    "text": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark, March 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Sunstone Capital, a leading European early-stage venture capital firm, yesterday divested 1.6 million shares, equal to 50% of its holding in Asetek AS, a global leader in liquid cooling solutions for data centers, servers and PCs.\nThe shares were sold through an accelerated book-building process at a price of NOK 95 per share. There was strong demand for the shares. Sunstone Capital retains ownership of approximately 1.6 million shares, equal to 6.2% of the share capital of Asetek after the transaction.\nSunstone Capital is represented by Jørgen Smidt on the Board of Directors at Asetek.\n\"It has been a rewarding journey for us, both financially and professionally, since making the initial investment in Asetek in 2005\", said Jørgen Smidt at Sunstone Capital. \"The company has since moved out of the venture phase, developing from a niche player to an emerging mainstream hardware provider to some of the biggest brands in the global computer and data center market.\"\nSunstone Capital has invested in Asetek through the Sunstone Technology Ventures Fund I, which is backed by The Danish Growth Fund, the Danish state investment fund that contributes to the creation of new companies.\n\"Over the years, Asetek has demonstrated an extraordinary ability to adapt to new technologies while at the same time meeting the highest standards of performance. As investors it has been a pleasure to observe how the company with roots in Denmark has succeeded in a tough and truly global marketplace through dedication and outstanding leadership,\" said Christian Motzfeldt, CEO of Vækstfonden - the Danish Growth Fund.\nSunstone Capital will distribute the proceeds of more than NOK 150 million to the Danish Growth Fund, which will reinvest the proceeds in other Danish growth companies. Sunstone Capital's investment in Asetek has had a significant impact on the performance of the Sunstone Technology Ventures Fund I.\nAbout Asetek:\nAsetek is the global leader in liquid cooling solutions for data centers, servers and PCs.
