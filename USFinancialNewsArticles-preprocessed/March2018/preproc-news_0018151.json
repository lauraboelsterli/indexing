    "text": "BEIJING, March 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- China Distance Education Holdings Limited (NYSE: DL) (\"CDEL\", or the \"Company\"), a leading provider of online education and value-added services for professionals and corporate clients in China, today announced unaudited financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 ended December 31, 2017.\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial and Operational Highlights\nNet revenue increased by 12.2% to $35.9 million from $32.0 million in the prior year period. Total course enrollments were 1,227,000, a decrease of 5.1% from the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Cash receipts from online course registration were $40.3 million, a 50.4% increase from the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross profit decreased by 8.7% to $17.5 million from $19.2 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP 1 gross profit decreased by 8.7% to $17.5 million from $19.2 million in the prior year period. Gross margin was 48.8%, compared with 59.9% in the prior year period. Non-GAAP1 gross margin was 48.9%, compared with 60.1% in the prior year period. Operating income decreased by 35.8% to $5.1 million from $8.0 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP 1 operating income decreased by 33.6% to $5.6 million from $8.5 million in the prior year period. Net income was $94,000, compared with net income of $8.6 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP 1 net income was $0.6 million compared with net income of $9.1 million in the prior year period. Basic and diluted net income per American Depositary Share (\"ADS\") were $0.003, compared with basic and diluted net income per ADS of $0.260 and $0.259, respectively, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Each ADS represents four ordinary shares. Basic and diluted non-GAAP 1 net income per ADS were $0.018, compared with basic and diluted non-GAAP 1 net income per ADS of $0.276 and $0.275, respectively, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Cash flow from operations decreased by 19.9% to $13.2 million from $16.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\n1 For more information about the non-GAAP financial measures contained in this press release, please see \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below\nMr. Zhengdong Zhu, Chairman and CEO of CDEL, said, \"We are pleased to report first quarter net revenue growth of 12.2% year-over-year, which exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Better-than-expected first quarter net revenue was driven primarily by the continued strength of our accounting vertical as well as strong growth from the sale of books and reference materials. Our first quarter total course enrollments were down 5.1% year-over-year, largely due to a decline in accounting continuing education course enrollments as a result of the previously disclosed cancellation of the Accounting Certificate examination. Excluding accounting continuing education course enrollments, our first quarter total course enrollments increased 26.4% year-over-year. In particular, our first quarter online accounting test preparation course enrollments grew 39.3% year-over-year. We are pleased to report that the strong growth of online accounting test preparation course enrollments contributed to an impressive 50.4% year-over-year increase in cash receipts from online course registration.\"\nMr. Zhu concluded, \"As China's preeminent provider of online education and value-added services for professionals and corporate clients, we strive to build industry-leading education verticals that promote our lifelong learning ecosystem. With a proven business model and powerful growth initiatives in place, we look forward to continuing our relentless efforts to grow our diversified industry verticals and broaden our course offerings and services in key disciplines.\"\nMr. Mark Marostica, Co-Chief Financial Officer of CDEL, said, \"As previously disclosed, we experienced a significant decrease in our operating margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 (September), primarily due to increased salaries and related expenses, as well as an increase in advertising and promotional expenses. As anticipated, the increase in salaries and related expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with the year-ago period continued to be the primary driver of the year-over-year decline in our first quarter operating margin. However, excluding the headcount of Jiangsu Asset, which we acquired in November 2017, our first quarter headcount remained relatively stable compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 as expected.\"\nMr. Marostica continued, \"We delivered strong growth of cash receipts in the first quarter despite a moderation in the rate of growth of our advertising and promotional expenses, which were up only approximately 7% year-over-year in the first quarter, showcasing the strength of our brand and wide appeal of our courses to students. We anticipate the moderation in the rate of growth of advertising and promotion spending and relatively stable headcount will extend into our second quarter of fiscal 2018 as well, and augur an improvement in our operating margin in the second half of fiscal 2018.\"\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2018 Financial Results\nNet Revenue. Total net revenue increased by 12.2% to $35.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from $32.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Net revenue from online education services, books and reference materials, and other sources contributed 62.6%, 6.6% and 30.8%, respectively, of total net revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nOnline education services. Net revenue from online education services increased by 11.6% to $22.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from $20.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, mainly due to strong revenue growth from our accounting vertical. In particular, the strong revenue growth of elementary APQE courses more than offset the adverse revenue impact from the cancellation of the Accounting Certificate Examination and the downstream effect of this examination cancellation on Accounting Continuing Education revenue. In addition, the strong revenue growth from intermediate APQE and accounting practical skills training courses also contributed to the revenue growth. The year-over-year increase in revenue from online education services was partially offset by a decrease in revenue from E&C Continuing Education courses.\nBooks and reference materials. Net revenue from books and reference materials increased by 44.8% to $2.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, from $1.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nOthers. Net revenue from other sources increased by 8.1% to $11.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from $10.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, primarily due to revenue growth from offline accounting professional training courses. The increase in revenue from other sources was partially offset by year-over-year decreases in revenue from the sale of learning simulation software and business start-up training services.\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales increased by 43.5% to $18.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from $12.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP 1 cost of sales increased by 43.6% to $18.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from $12.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase was mainly due to increased salaries and related expenses resulting from a higher number of personnel, increased cost of books and reference materials, increased rental and related expenses, as well as other miscellaneous expenses.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin . Gross profit was $17.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, down 8.7% from $19.2 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP 1 gross profit was $17.5 million, down 8.7% from $19.2 million in the prior year period. Gross margin was 48.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with 59.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP 1 gross margin was 48.9% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, compared with 60.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nOperating Expenses. Total operating expenses increased by 20.5% to $14.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, from $11.7 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP 1 total operating expenses increased by 21.3% to $13.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, from $11.3 million in the prior year period.\nSelling expenses. Selling expenses increased by 27.0% to $9.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from $7.2 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP 1 selling expenses increased by 27.0% to $9.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from $7.2 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by increased salaries and related expenses and increased commissions to online agents.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by 10.3% to $5.0 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from $4.5 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP 1 general and administrative expenses increased by 11.4% to $4.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from $4.1 million in the prior year period. The increase was mainly due to increased salaries and related expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense. Income tax expense decreased by 72.0% to $0.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from $2.4 million in the prior year period, primarily due to a decrease in taxable income.\nNet Income. As a result of the foregoing, net income was $94,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with net income of $8.6 million in the prior year period. Non-GAAP 1 net income was $0.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 compared with net income of $9.1 million in the prior year period.\nOperating Cash Flow . Net operating cash inflow decreased by 19.9% to $13.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 from $16.5 million in the prior year period. The decrease in operating cash inflow was mainly attributable to the decrease in net income before non-cash items generated in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in accounts receivable, inventories, prepayments and other current assets, and the decrease in income tax payable also contributed to the operating cash outflow. This operating cash outflow was partially offset by the increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities, and deferred revenue.\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Term Deposits, Restricted Cash and Short-term Investments . Cash and cash equivalents, term deposits, restricted cash and short-term investments as of December 31, 2017 increased by 2.3% to $103.0 million from $100.6 million as of September 30, 2017, mainly due to the operating cash inflow generated and a 1-year bank loan of $20.1 million raised in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase was partially offset by (i) the payments of balances of $5.4 million and $0.4 million in connection with acquisition of Jiangsu Asset and investment in Chongqing Moses Robots, respectively, (ii) the payments of $2.4 million and $3.8 million in connection with investments in Hangzhou Wanting and Beijing teacheredu, respectively, (iii) the payment of deposit of $7.6 million for the purchase of an office building in Xiamen, (iv) the repayment of a short-term loan from a related party of $1.7 million, (v) the repayment of a bank loan of $15.0 million and (vi) the capital expenditure of $1.2 million.\nOutlook\nFor the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company expects to generate total net revenue in the range of $27.8 million to $28.9 million, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 27% to 32%.\nFor fiscal year 2018, the Company expects to generate total net revenues in the range of $150.6 million to $157.2 million, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 15% to 20%.\nThe above guidance reflects the Company's current and preliminary view, which is subject to change.\nConference Call\nManagement will hold a conference call at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, March 8, 2018 (9:00 p.m. Beijing Time on Thursday, March 8, 2018) to discuss financial results and answer questions from investors and analysts.

Adjustments to the financial statements may be identified when audit work is performed for the year-end audit, which could result in significant differences from this preliminary unaudited financial information.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the Company's consolidated financial results presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, the Company uses the following measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP net income, operating income, gross profit, cost of sales, selling expenses, general and administrative expenses, net income margin, operating margin, gross profit margin and basic and diluted earnings per ADS and per share. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \"Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures\" set forth at the end of this release.\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance and liquidity by excluding share-based compensation expenses. However, non-GAAP financial measures may not be indicative of the Company's operating performance from a cash perspective. The Company believes that both management and investors benefit from these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing its performance and when planning and forecasting future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical performance and liquidity. The Company computes its non-GAAP financial measures using the same consistent method from quarter to quarter. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. A limitation of excluding share-based compensation expenses from the above-mentioned line items and presenting these non-GAAP measures is that such items may continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense or income in our business. Management compensates for this limitation by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from each non-GAAP measure. The accompanying table at the end of this release provides more detail on the reconciliations between GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures.\nContacts:\nChina Distance Education Holdings Limited\nThe Piacente Group | Investor Relations\nInvestor Relations Department\nBrandi Piacente\nTel: +86-10-8231-9999 ext. 1805\nTel: +1
