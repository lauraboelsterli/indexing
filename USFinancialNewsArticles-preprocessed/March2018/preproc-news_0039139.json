    "text": "GRAND RAPIDS, Minn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ASV Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: ASV), a leading provider of rubber-tracked compact track loaders and wheeled skid steer loaders in the compact construction equipment market, today announced Full Year and Fourth Quarter 2017 results.\nFor the Full Year 2017, the Company reported Net Sales of $123.3 million and Net Income of $1.7 million or $0.19 per share compared to Net Sales of $103.8 million and a Net Loss of $(1.2) million or $(0.15) per share for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported Net Sales of $30.5 million and a Net Loss of $(0.8) million or $(0.08) per share compared to Net Sales of $25.0 million and a Net Loss of $(2.1) million or $(0.26) per share for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Highlights\n$123.3 million in Net Sales represented a year-over-year increase of 18.8% over $103.8 million in 2016. Machine sales revenues increased year over year by 32.0% to $81.5 million. Adjusted 2017 net income* of $2.0 million or $0.22 per share, compared to 2016 adjusted pro forma C Corporation net loss of $(1.2) million or $(0.13) per share, representing a positive swing of $3.2 million. EBITDA of $9.9 million or 8.1% of sales compared to $10.7 million or 10.3% of sales for 2016. Adjusted EBITDA* of $10.7 million or 8.7% of sales compared to 2016 pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $7.8 million or 7.5% of sales. Independent dealer / rental locations increased to 222 at December 31, 2017 compared to 133 at December 31, 2016. Transition to ASV distribution substantially completed during the year, with 97.0% of machine sales to the ASV network in 2017. Reduced total Net Indebtedness by $16.5 million to $26.9 million as of December 31, 2017 compared to $43.4 million at December 31, 2016 representing a 40% reduction in debt. Leverage ratio at December 31, 2017 cut by nearly 60% to 2.5x trailing adjusted EBITDA, compared to 5.6x at December 31, 2016.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\n$30.5 million in Net Sales represented a year-over-year increase of 21.5% over $25.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Machine sales revenues increased year-over-year by 39.0% to $21.0 million. Adjusted fourth quarter 2017 net income* of $0.5 million or $0.05 per share, compared to fourth quarter 2016 adjusted pro forma C Corporation net loss of $(0.8) million or $(0.10) per share, representing a positive swing of $1.3 million. The largest adjustment to earnings came from debt refinancing costs as discussed below. EBITDA of $1.7 million or 5.6% of sales compared to $2.4 million or 9.8% of sales for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA* of $2.2 million or 7.4% of sales compared to fourth quarter 2016 pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $1.0 million or 4.0% of sales. Completed re-financing of credit facility with new 5-year, $50.0 million facility, reducing weighted average effective interest cost to approximately 5.3%, compared to 6.9% at December 31, 2016. We incurred $0.9 million debt refinancing costs including the amortized costs of the prior facilities and a pre-payment penalty in the period.\n*The Glossary at the end of this press release contains further details regarding reconciliation of GAAP items and Adjusted and Pro-forma items.\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Rooke commented, “2017 was a transformative year for ASV, in which we reassumed substantially all of the branding and distribution of our product line. We have nearly doubled our independent dealer and rental network locations, and established the infrastructure needed to thrive and grow as a public company. While public company costs impacted our bottom line, we have been profitable each quarter on an adjusted basis, we’ve significantly strengthened the balance sheet and we remain well-positioned for improvements in each of our key performance indicators during 2018 and beyond. My thanks go to the ASV team who led this, and to all stakeholders who contributed to our efforts.”\n“Our performance for the year was highlighted by a year-over-year incremental $2.9 million in adjusted EBITDA, representing 15% margin on incremental sales. We generated $7.5 million in cash flow from operations, and total indebtedness was reduced almost 40% from a year ago. Our 18.8% top-line growth for the year, essentially all coming from machine sales, also benefitted from our progress in the rental market, to which our sales were approximately 40% higher in 2017 than in 2016. With the build out of North America retail and rental distribution to 222 locations, and continued strength in Australia and New Zealand, we are optimistic about the opportunities for further expansion.”\nMr. Rooke continued, “The relocation of our aftermarket parts distribution center next to our Grand Rapids, Minnesota headquarters and manufacturing facility, which we started in the fourth quarter of 2017, is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter 2018, ahead of plan. While we will incur certain costs from this move in the first quarter, we expect significant customer service and parts availability improvements and reduced operating costs, once fully transitioned, to yield a payback of approximately one year or less. The end-markets that ASV serves are building momentum and our products continue to enjoy unique and well-understood advantages and value to dealers and end-users alike. We expect to take advantage of these strong markets to increase our sales, EBITDA margin and net income in 2018 and beyond.”\nMissi How, Chief Financial Officer, commented, “We are pleased with the progress we made in 2017. We generated nearly $7.5 million in operating cash compared to $2.4 million in 2016, and we swung to a reported pretax profit of $1.1 million for the year versus a loss of $1.2 million last year. A primary focus has been the strengthening of our balance sheet. We made significant progress in managing our inventory, which improved our days on hand and lowered our DSO, resulting in an improvement in our net working capital to annualized last quarters’ sales to 23.6% as compared to 31.6% in 2016. Cash generated from operations together with the proceeds from the IPO enabled us to reduce our total net debt by $16.5 million during 2017 and lower our leverage ratio to 2.5x trailing adjusted EBITDA. With the re-structuring of our credit facility completed in the fourth quarter, we expect the benefits of the refinancing to reduce our annual interest expense by approximately $0.8 million in 2018.”\nConference Call:\nManagement will host a conference call at 4:30 PM Eastern Time today to discuss the results with the investment community.

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA less the gain or loss related to non-recurring events. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful supplemental measures of our operating performance and provide meaningful measures of overall corporate performance exclusive of our capital structure and the method and timing of expenditures associated with building and placing our products. EBITDA is also presented because management believes that it is frequently used by investment analysts, investors and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also presented because management believes that it provides a measure of our recurring core business.\nHowever, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized earnings measures under generally accepted accounting principles of the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) and do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP. Therefore, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Investors are cautioned that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as alternatives to net income or loss or other income statement data (which are determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP) as an indicator of our performance or as a measure of liquidity and cash flows. Management’s method of calculating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may differ materially from the method used by other companies and accordingly, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nReconciliation of EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA (in millions except percentages) For the Quarter Ended\nDecember 31,\nFor the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (loss) ($0.8) ($2.1) $1.7 ($1.2) Interest Expense 0.6 1.1 3.0 5.0 Loss on debt extinguishment 0.9 2.2 1.0 2.2 Depreciation & Amortization 1.2 1.2 4.8 4.7 Income Tax (Benefit) Expense (0.2) - (0.6) - EBITDA (1) $1.7 $2.4 $9.9 $10.7 % of Sales 5.6% 9.8% 8.1% 10.3% EBITDA $1.7 $2.4 $9.9 $10.7 Costs of ConExpo trade show (2) - - 0.1 - Revision to accrual for legal proceeding expenses less legal costs (3)\n0.1 (0.9) (0.1) (1.4) Stock compensation and transaction related compensation costs (4) 0.1 - 0.5 - Aftermarket parts distribution center relocation (5) 0.3 - 0.3 - Adjusted EBITDA (6) $2.2 $1.5 $10.7 $9.3 Adjusted EBITDA as % of net revenues 7.4% 6.0% 8.7% 9.0% Pro-forma adjustment for public company costs - (0.5) - (1.5) Pro-forma Adjusted EBITDA* $2.2 $1.0 $10.7 $7.8 % of Sales 7.4% 4.0% 8.7% 7.5% *\nThe Company converted to a C corporation in May 2017, and consequently 2017 EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 includes approximately $0.5 million and $1.5 million of public company costs not included in 2016 EBITDA. For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA is $1.0 million and $7.8 million. (1) EBITDA is defined as income or loss before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a recognized measure under U.S. GAAP and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP. Therefore, EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The table above reconciles net income to EBITDA. See “—Cautionary Statements Regarding Non-GAAP Measures” for further information regarding EBITDA. (2) Costs associated with the 2017 ConExpo trade show. The ConExpo show, which is held every three years, was held in Las Vegas in March of this year. This show is an international gathering place for the construction industries. It is estimated that 130,000 professionals from around the world attended the show. (3) Revision to accrual for legal proceeding expenses is included in Adjusted EBITDA since it is an adjustment in the period to an accrual established at the formation of the Joint Venture and is not representative of the operating activity in the reported period. This adjustment was due to the settlement of a legal claim lower than the accrued cost. (4) Stock compensation and IPO transaction related compensation costs. (5) Aftermarket Parts Distribution Center relocation costs are restructuring costs related to the movement of the ASV aftermarket parts operation from Southaven Memphis to a facility adjacent to the Company principal premises in Grand Rapids MN, which commenced in quarter four of 2017 and was completed in quarter one of 2018. (6) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA less the gain or loss related to non-recurring events. Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized measure under U.S. GAAP and does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The table above reconciles EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA. See “—Cautionary Statements Regarding Non-GAAP Measures” for further information regarding EBITDA.
