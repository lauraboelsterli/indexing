    "text": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Noyes, a 110-year-old wealth management and investment banking firm, is pleased to announce that J. Christopher Cooke, CIMA® and Brian F. Cooke, CIMA®, both partners at Cooke Financial Group at Noyes, have been named to the 2018 edition of the Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisors. The list recognizes them among the best advisors at national, independent, regional and bank broker-dealers across the United States.\n“The FT 400 is an impressive group, and we are proud to have Chris and Brian recognized for their work,” said Mark Damer, president and CEO of Noyes Group, LLC. “They are committed to their clients and their clients’ success.”\nChris Cooke and Brian Cooke, who are brothers, lead Cooke Financial Group, a second-generation business providing investment consulting, financial planning and wealth management services to high-net-worth individuals and families, nonprofit organizations, and institutional clients. Cooke Financial Group is an independent division of Noyes. This is the third year in a row that both Chris and Brian have been named to this elite list.\n“We are honored to be recognized in the FT Top 400,” said Chris Cooke. “It represents the efforts of everyone at our firm and the dedication we have to our clients.”\nThe Financial Times 400 Top Financial Advisors is an independent listing produced annually by the Financial Times.

The listing reflects each advisor’s status in six primary areas: assets under management (AUM), asset growth, compliance record, experience, credentials and online accessibility. Neither the brokerages nor the advisors pay a fee to the Financial Times in exchange for inclusion in the FT 400.\nAbout Noyes\nNoyes, through its subsidiaries, David A.
