Linde Group logo is seen at company building before the annual news conference in Munich, Germany March 9, 2017. REUTERS/Lukas Barth The European Commission on Feb. 26 suspended its investigation into the deal, which will create a global leader, while waiting for the companies to provide information. The companies plan to divest assets across Europe to address EU competition concerns, according to sources. Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Philip Blenkinsop",
