(NASDAQ:GRBK) (“we,” “Green Brick” or the “Company”) today reported results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nResults for the Fourth Quarter Ended December 31, 2017:\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company had: pre-tax income of $17.2 million, an increase of 25.5%, compared to $13.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016; gross profit of $28.8 million, a decrease of 1.3%, compared to $29.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016; and total revenue of $136.4 million, an increase of 13.9%, compared to $119.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nBuilder operations revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $133.5 million, an increase of 14.1%, compared to $117.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Land development revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $2.9 million, an increase of 4.6%, compared to $2.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.\nThe dollar value of backlog units as of December 31, 2017 was $151.5 million, an increase of 40.2% compared to December 31, 2016. The average sales price of homes in backlog increased approximately $32,767, or 7.2%, to $488,590 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $455,823 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nHomes under construction increased 30.5% to 736 as of December 31, 2017, compared to 564 as of December 31, 2016.\nAs a result of the comprehensive tax legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), enacted by the U.S. government on December 22, 2017, basic net (loss) income attributable to Green Brick per common share (“EPS”) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $(0.16). Basic EPS decreased due to a change in the federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%. The Company remeasured its deferred tax assets (“DTA”) which resulted in additional tax expense of $19.0 million. Without the impact of the DTA remeasurement, basic EPS would have increased to $0.21 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.16 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Basic adjusted net income attributable to Green Brick per common share (“Adjusted EPS”) for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $0.34, compared to $0.28 for the three months ended December 31, 2016. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nResults for the Year Ended December 31, 2017:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company had: pre-tax income of $53.9 million, an increase of 38.1%, compared to $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016; gross profit of $98.5 million, an increase of 14.0%, compared to $86.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016; and total revenue of $454.4 million, an increase of 19.5%, compared to $380.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nBuilder operations revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $435.6 million, an increase of 19.3%, compared to $365.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Land development revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $18.7 million, an increase of 23.5%, compared to $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nBasic EPS for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $0.30. Without the impact of the DTA remeasurement discussed above, basic EPS would have increased to $0.69 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.49 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Basic Adjusted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.09, compared to $0.80 for the year ended December 31, 2016. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n“We finished 2017 with a very strong fourth quarter with pre-tax income up 25% and full year pre-tax income of $53.9 million, up 38%. Looking forward, we are entering 2018 with a 40% increase in backlog and a 30% increase in homes under construction,” said James R. Brickman, Green Brick’s Chief Executive Officer. “We had very strong January and February 2018 sales and we expect to announce several new neighborhoods in supply-constrained, high-margin, AAA locations in 2018. So 2018 is off to a healthy start. To fund our growth, we are pleased that JPMorgan recently joined our unsecured credit facility with a $30 million commitment which increases the facility to $160 million. Our secured and unsecured credit facilities now total $235 million.”\nEarnings Conference Call:\nWe will host our earnings conference call to discuss our fourth quarter and the year ended December 31, 2017 at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, March 13, 2018. The call can be accessed by dialing 800-374-0137 for domestic participants or 904-685-8013 for international participants. Participants should reference conference ID code 4484949. A replay of the call will be available from approximately 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time on March 13, 2018 through 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on March 20, 2018. To access the replay, the domestic dial-in number is 855-859-2056, the international dial-in number is 404-537-3406 and the conference ID code is 4484949.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\nIn this press release, we utilize certain financial measures that are non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We present these measures because we believe they and similar measures are useful to management and investors in evaluating the Company’s operating performance and financing structure. We also believe these measures facilitate the comparison of our operating performance and financing structure with other companies in our industry. Because these measures are not calculated in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe Tax Act, among other things, reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and imposes significant limitations on certain corporate deductions and credits. The Tax Act places future limitations on the usage of net operating loss carryforwards generated in the year ended December 31, 2018 and after. The Tax Act is comprehensive containing several other provisions, some of which will not materially impact the Company. The estimates of the Tax Act may be adjusted in future periods as required. Future implementation guidance from the Internal Revenue Service, clarifications of state tax law or the completion of the Company’s 2017 tax return filings could all affect the estimated financial statement impact of the Tax Act. The SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 that allows for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. The Company does not believe potential adjustments in future periods would materially impact the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company remeasured its DTA which resulted in additional tax expense of $19.0 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017. Due to the effects of the Tax Act, the net (loss) income attributable to Green Brick for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and for the year ended December 31, 2017 is not comparable to three months ended December 31, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGREEN BRICK PARTNERS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED CONDENSED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In thousands, except per share data) (unaudited) Three Months Ended December 31, Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Sale of residential units $ 133,465 $ 116,977 $ 435,644 $ 365,164 Sale of land and lots 2,915 2,787 18,730 15,164 Total revenues 136,380 119,764 454,374 380,328 Cost of residential units 104,999 88,453 342,065 283,454 Cost of land and lots 2,550 2,110 13,856 10,499 Total cost of sales 107,549 90,563 355,921 293,953 Total gross profit 28,831 29,201 98,453 86,375 Salary expense 5,838 5,985 21,823 21,871 Selling, general and administrative expense 4,446 4,483 17,193 16,758 Operating profit 18,547 18,733 59,437 47,746 Equity in income of unconsolidated entity 1,778 — 2,746 — Other income, net 691 408 2,054 2,808 Income before taxes 21,016 19,141 64,237 50,554 Income tax provision 25,396 6,041 39,031 15,381 Net (loss) income (4,380 ) 13,100 25,206 35,173 Less: net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 3,816 5,424 10,236 11,417 Net (loss) income attributable to Green Brick Partners, Inc. $ (8,196 ) $ 7,676 $ 14,970 $ 23,756 Net (loss) income attributable to Green Brick Partners, Inc. per common share: Basic $(0.16\n) $0.16\n$0.30\n$0.49\nDiluted $(0.16\n) $0.16\n$0.30\n$0.49\nWeighted average common shares used in the calculation of net income attributable to Green Brick Partners, Inc. per common share: Basic 50,555 48,910 49,597 48,879 Diluted 50,681 48,930 49,683 48,886\nGREEN BRICK PARTNERS, INC.\nUNAUDITED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION Three Months Ended Years Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) December 31, Increase (Decrease) New Homes Delivered and Home Sales Revenue 2017 2016 Change % 2017 2016 Change % New homes delivered 292 275 17 6.2 % 990 844 146 17.3 % Home sales revenue ($ in thousands) $ 133,465 $ 116,977 $ 16,488 14.1 % $ 435,644 $ 365,164 $ 70,480 19.3 % Average sales price of homes delivered $ 457,072 $ 425,371 $ 31,701 7.5 % $ 440,044 $ 432,659 $ 7,385 1.7 %\nThree Months Ended Years Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) December 31, Increase (Decrease) Land and Lots Sales Revenue 2017 2016 Change % 2017 2016 Change % Land and lots sold 25 22 3 13.6 % 144 117 27 23.1 % Land and lots sales revenue ($ in thousands) $ 2,915 $ 2,787 $ 128 4.6 % $ 18,730 $ 15,164 $ 3,566 23.5 % Average sales price of land and lots sold $ 116,600 $ 126,682 $ (10,082 ) (8.0 )% $ 130,067 $ 129,603 $ 464 0.4 %\nThree Months Ended Years Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) December 31, Increase (Decrease) New Home Orders and Backlog 2017 2016 Change % 2017 2016 Change % Net new home orders 265 197 68 34.5 % 1,063 880 183 20.8 % Average selling communities 56 50 6 12.0 % 54 47 7 14.9 % Selling communities at end of period 55 50 5 10.0 % 55 50 5 10.0 % Backlog ($ in thousands) $ 151,463 $ 108,030 $ 43,433 40.2 % Backlog (units) 310 237 73 30.8 % Average sales price of backlog $ 488,590 $ 455,823 $ 32,767 7.2 %\nThe following table calculates the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EPS for the three months and the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and reconciles these amounts to net (loss) income attributable to Green Brick as reported and prepared in accordance with GAAP.

These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “predicts,” “potential,” “continues,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “outlook,” “strategy,” “positioned,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “projects,” “estimates” and similar expressions, as well as statements in the future tense. These statements are based on assumptions that Green Brick has made in light of its experience in the industry as well as its perceptions of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other factors it believes are appropriate under the circumstances. Accordingly, all such forward-looking statements involve estimates and assumptions that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in the statements. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements are the following: general economic conditions, seasonality, cyclicality and competition in the homebuilding industry; demand for real estate investments in the geographic markets in which we operate; significant inflation or deflation; labor and raw material shortages; the failure to recruit, retain and develop highly skilled and competent employees; an inability to acquire land suitable for residential homebuilding at reasonable prices; an inability to develop and sell communities successfully or within expected timeframes; risks related to regulatory approvals and government regulation; the interpretation of or changes to tax, labor and environmental laws and regulations; volatility of mortgage interest rates; the unavailability of mortgage financing; the occurrence of severe weather or natural disasters; risks related to future growth through strategic investments, joint ventures, partnerships and/or acquisitions; risks related to holding noncontrolling interests in strategic investments, joint ventures, partnerships and/or acquisitions; the inability to obtain suitable bonding for the development of housing projects; difficulty in obtaining sufficient capital; the occurrence of a major health and safety incident; poor relations with the residents of our communities; information technology failures and data security breaches; product liability claims, litigation and warranty claims; our debt and related service obligations; required accounting changes; an inability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting; and other risks and uncertainties inherent in our business. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ from those anticipated are discussed in the “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s annual and quarterly reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Because the factors referred to above could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements made by Green Brick, you should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements.
