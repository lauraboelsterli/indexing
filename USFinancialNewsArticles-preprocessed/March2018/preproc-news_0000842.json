(Nasdaq:KTWO) (the “Company” or “K2M”), a global leader of complex spine and minimally invasive solutions focused on achieving three-dimensional Total Body Balance™, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nFiscal Year 2017 Financial Summary:\nTotal fiscal year 2017 revenue of $258.0 million, up 9% year-over-year on both a reported basis and on a constant currency basis.

Major succeeded Dan Pelak, who assumed the role of Independent Lead Director after serving as Chairman since 2010. On October 23, 2017, the Company announced that it has acquired from Cardinal Spine, a privately held medical device company, the PALO ALTO ® Cervical Static Corpectomy Cage System. PALO ALTO, a cervical vertebral body replacement device, is the first and only static corpectomy cage in the world to receive a cervical 510(k) clearance from the FDA. In addition to PALO ALTO, K2M has also acquired the associated intellectual property and product inventory. On October 25, 2017, the Company announced a global compatibility and co-marketing agreement with Brainlab. The two companies will collaborate in the commercial release of future navigated K2M spinal systems, which would be compatible with Brainlab spinal navigation systems. On November 30, 2017, the Company announced the completion of 300 surgical cases using the RHINE™ Cervical Disc System*. The RHINE Cervical Disc System* is an artificial disc replacement that features a one-piece compressible polymer core design with dome-shaped, plasma-coated endplates and a central-split keel. On December 20, 2017, the Company announced that it received a CE Mark for its CAPRI® Cervical 3D Expandable Corpectomy Cage System* featuring Lamellar 3D Titanium Technology™ and the successful completion of its first surgical case. * These products are intended for export and not sold or offered for sale in the United States.\n\"Our financial results for calendar year 2017 reflect total revenue growth of approximately 9% year-over-year, above the high-end of our guidance range,\" said Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Eric Major. \"We delivered approximately 9% growth in the United States in 2017—well above-market growth rates—driven by solid execution against our strategic goal of increasing market share by introducing new and innovative spinal implant solutions and expanding our distribution footprint. We have supplemented this organic growth activity with exciting product introductions in both the complex spine and degenerative categories. Looking out to 2018, we are excited about the opportunity of our first-of-its-kind MOJAVE™ PL 3D Expandable Interbody System featuring Lamellar 3D Titanium Technology and our YUKON™ OCT Spinal System that can be used with the PALO ALTO Cervical Static Corpectomy Cage System, the first and only static corpectomy cage in the world to receive a cervical 510(k) clearance. We also announced an important strategic collaboration with Brainlab, one of the world's leading imaging and navigation companies, that we believe will represent additional implant sales opportunities in the second half of 2018. Our Brainlab collaboration will complement our recent launches of the BACS ® platform and the EVEREST ® Minimally Invasive XT Spinal System.”\nMr. Major continued, \"We remain confident in our ability to drive above-market growth in the U.S., fueled by our continued focus on leading the spine market by introducing new and innovative spinal implant solutions to help surgeons care for patients around the world who suffer from debilitating spinal pathologies. We have introduced our 2018 guidance expectations for revenue growth of 9% to 10% with improved profitability.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nThree Months Ended December 31, Increase / Decrease ($,thousands) 2017 2016 $ Change % Change % Change (as reported) (constant currency) United States $ 51,856 $ 47,669 $ 4,187 8.8 % 8.8 % International $ 15,945 $ 14,122 $ 1,823 12.9 % 9.8 % Total Revenue: $ 67,801 $ 61,791 $ 6,010 9.7 % 9.0 % Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $6.0 million, or 9.7%, to $67.8 million, compared to $61.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Total revenue increased 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. The increase in revenue was primarily driven by higher sales volume from domestic new surgeon users and newer product offerings, and increased set investments by our distribution partners in Australia and Denmark.\nRevenue in the United States increased $4.2 million, or 8.8% year-over-year, to $51.9 million, and international revenue increased $1.8 million, or 12.9% year-over-year, to $15.9 million. Fourth quarter 2017 international revenue increased 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Foreign currency exchange positively impacted fourth quarter international revenue by $0.4 million, representing approximately 73 basis points of 2017 international growth year-over-year.\nThe following table represents domestic revenue by procedure category.\nThree Months Ended December 31, Increase / Decrease ($,thousands) 2017 2016 $ Change % Change Complex Spine $ 20,004 $ 17,934 $ 2,070 11.5 % Minimally Invasive 8,906 8,058 848 10.5 % Degenerative 22,946 21,677 1,269 5.9 % U.S Revenue: $ 51,856 $ 47,669 $ 4,187 8.8 % By procedure category, U.S. revenue in the Company’s complex spine, MIS and degenerative categories represented 38.6%, 17.2% and 44.2% of U.S. revenue, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 13.6% to $43.6 million, compared to $38.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross margin was 64.3% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 62.1% for the prior year period. Gross profit includes amortization expense on investments in surgical instruments of $3.6 million, or 5.3% of sales, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $3.6 million, or 5.8% of sales, for the comparable period last year.\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased $4.7 million, or 9.9%, to $52.5 million, compared to $47.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by a $4.9 million increase in sales and marketing expenses, compared to the comparable period last year. The Company increased the number of domestic sales agencies who represent our products in the United States by nine agencies to a total of 109 independent sales agencies, an increase of 9% sequentially. In addition, the Company’s U.S. and non-U.S. direct sales employees remained flat at 158 employees, despite active management of this group.\nLoss from operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased $0.5 million to $8.9 million compared to a loss from operations of $9.4 million for the comparable period last year. Loss from operations included intangible amortization of $0.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2.6 million for the comparable period last year. The Company recorded approximately $1.4 million in non-recurring accruals primarily reflecting legal and administrative expenses updated in 2018 and inventory adjustments.\nTotal other expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased $1.6 million to $1.5 million, compared to $3.1 million last year. The decrease in other expense, net, was primarily attributable to a unrealized gain of $0.3 million from foreign currency remeasurement on intercompany payable balances, compared to unrealized loss of $1.3 million in the comparable period last year.\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.7 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $12.5 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFiscal Year 2017 Financial Results\nYear Ended December 31, Increase / Decrease ($ in,thousands) 2017 2016 $ Change % Change % Change (as reported) (constant currency) United States $ 197,312 $ 181,078 $ 16,234 9.0 % 9.0 % International $ 60,719 $ 55,556 $ 5,163 9.3 % 9.7 % Total Revenue: $ 258,031 $ 236,634 $ 21,397 9.0 % 9.1 % For the fiscal year 2017, total revenue increased $21.4 million, or 9.0%, to $258.0 million, compared to $236.6 million for the fiscal year 2016.

Management uses these non-GAAP measures principally as a measure of the Company's operating performance and believes that these measures are useful to investors because they are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the Company’s industry. The Company also believes that these measures are useful to its management and investors as a measure of comparative operating performance from period to period.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-to-period. We calculate constant currency by converting the prior-year results using current-year foreign currency exchange rates.\nAdjusted Gross Profit represents Gross Profit less amortization expense of surgical instruments. The Company presents Adjusted Gross Profit because it believes it is a useful measure of the Company's gross profit and operating performance because the measure is not burdened by the timing impact of instrument purchases and related amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net loss plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense and foreign currency transaction (gain) loss.\nThe Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes it is a useful indicator of the Company’s operating performance. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA principally as a measure of the Company’s operating performance and for planning purposes, including the preparation of the Company’s annual operating budget and financial projections.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and it should not be construed as an inference that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as it does not reflect certain cash requirements such as tax payments, debt service requirements, capital expenditures and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future. Adjusted EBITDA contains certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect the Company’s cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The Company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that the Company’s future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by primarily relying on its GAAP results in addition to using Adjusted EBITDA supplementally. The Company’s definition of Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.\nThe following table presents reconciliations of gross profit to adjusted gross profit and net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented.\n$ in thousands Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Reconciliation from Gross Profit to Adjusted Gross Profit Gross Profit $ 43,578 $ 38,360 $ 169,382 $ 154,456 Surgical instrument amortization 3,605 3,575 14,130 13,725 Adjusted Gross Profit (a Non-GAAP Measure) $ 47,183 $ 41,935 $ 183,512 $ 168,181\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Reconciliation from Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA Net loss $ (8,748 ) $ (12,467 ) $ (37,145 ) $ (41,660 ) Interest expense 1,753 1,720 6,964 4,425 Income tax (benefit) expense (1,602 ) 53 (1,474 ) 74 Depreciation and amortization 5,361 7,760 26,785 29,212 Stock-based compensation expense 1,610 1,575 5,932 6,956 Foreign currency transaction (gain) loss (284 ) 1,331 (1,802 ) 2,430 Adjusted EBITDA (a Non-GAAP Measure) $ (1,910 ) $ (28 ) $ (740 ) $ 1,437 The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for our 2018 guidance:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2018 Net loss $ (32,000 ) Interest expense 8,500 Income tax expense 100 Depreciation and amortization 23,000 Stock-based compensation expense 6,400 Foreign currency transaction gain —\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 6,000 The reconciliation assumes the mid-point of the Adjusted EBITDA range and the mid-point of each component of the reconciliation, corresponding to guidance of $4.0 million to $8.0 million for 2018.\nInvestor Contact: Westwicke Partners on behalf of K2M Group Holdings, Inc.
