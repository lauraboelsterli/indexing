    "text": "4 COMMENTS A longstanding racial gap over how New York City voters view Mayor Bill de Blasio appears to extend to his wife, Chirlane McCray, a new poll suggests.\nA Quinnipiac University poll Wednesday found that 57% of black voters approve of the job Ms. McCray is doing as first lady, compared with 39% of white voters. Among Hispanic voters, 47% approved.\nThe first lady’s overall approval rating is 43%, while 28% of respondents don’t approve of the job she is doing.\nThe poll comes weeks after Ms. McCray said she is considering running for elected office , likely in 2021, when Mr. de Blasio’s term is up.\nFor years, black New York City voters have been overwhelmingly more supportive of the Democratic mayor than their white counterparts.\nMs. McCray has taken an increasingly high-profile role in her husband’s administration. She leads the city’s more than $800 million mental-health initiative, known as Thrive NYC, as well as the city’s nonprofit, the Mayor’s Fund to Advance New York City. For years, the mayor has described Ms. McCray as his closest adviser. She is deeply involved in hiring decisions for senior roles at City Hall, and her name has sometimes appeared alongside the mayor’s in official news releases announcing senior hires.\nEarlier this month, Mr. de Blasio said he believed Ms. McCray should be paid for her work, something the city’s ethics laws prohibit. Later, Ms. McCray said she didn’t agree with the mayor. “I asked him today when he called me, like, ‘Why did you say that?’ ” she told reporters when asked about the mayor’s remarks. “Yes I’m one of his advisers. But sometimes husbands say things.”\nA slight majority of voters, 46%, said Ms. McCray should be paid for her work on behalf of the city, compared with 45% who didn’t. Among white voters, 35% said she should be paid, compared with 49% of Hispanic voters and 61% of black voters.\nWrite to Mara Gay at mara.gay@wsj.com",
