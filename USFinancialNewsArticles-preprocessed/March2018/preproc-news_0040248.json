    "text": "26 COMMENTS In “ Lessons From the Rise of America’s Irish ” (Upward Mobility, March 14), Jason L. Riley expresses his admiration for the Irish, who so successfully assimilated into American society, and he blames multiculturalism for the fact that many more recent immigrants have not blended in so successfully. The Irish had the benefit of looking exactly like the population into which they were assimilated, and of being largely English speaking. Was their achieving “prosperity” in any part due to the fact that by the second generation they were indistinguishable from the majority of U.S. citizens?\nCathlynn Groh\nSanta Fe, N.M.\nYes, Mr. Riley, the Irish made it in America, just like the Italians and Jews who followed in enormous numbers later in the 19th century. Eugenic biologists teaching in American colleges considered them all racially inferior—but not as inferior as the blacks. In 1967 the Supreme Court overturned the antimiscegenation laws in the last 14 states that forbade white people from marrying people of “color.” That didn’t include the ethnic Irish, Italians or Jews; they had earned their whiteness. The color of one’s skin has always mattered most in this country—that’s the lesson to be learned. Stop blaming the multiculturalists.\nSol Gittleman\nLexington, Mass.\nSurely being able to speak English, and in many cases to write it, allowed new Irish arrivals to skip ahead a generation in assimilation. One wonders whether the success stories of today’s immigrants from India may also be a belated, if unintended, advantage of Britain’s otherwise objectionable conquest and rule of the subcontinent.\nJames Connelly\nHingham, Mass.",
