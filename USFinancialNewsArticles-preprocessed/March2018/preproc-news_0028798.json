    "text": "March 15, 2018 / 10:00 AM / in an hour Rheinmetall expects further success in Australia after $2.5 bln order Reuters Staff 1 Min Read DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Germanyâ€™s Rheinmetall ( RHMG.DE ) said on Thursday it expects success in Australia with different vehicle types after beating BAE Systems ( BAES.L ) to a $2.5 billion order for armoured reconnaissance vehicles. The logo of German defence and automotive group Rheinmetall AG is pictured at the company's headquarters in Duesseldorf, Germany March 15, 2018. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay The company, which earlier forecast a rise in sales and earnings this year, also said defence demand in Germany was a growth driver as were defence policy in the European Union and digitalisation. Speaking at a news conference, CEO Armin Papperger also said he could not yet assess whether or when it would be possible to resume sales to Turkey, which have been banned by the German government following a political row.
