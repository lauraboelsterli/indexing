    "text": "ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopian soldiers killed nine civilians and injured 12 after mistaking them for rebels near a town along the country’s border with Kenya, state media said on Sunday.\nThe soldiers were deployed to the Moyale area of the country’s Oromiya region in pursuit of Oromo Liberation Front fighters who had crossed into Ethiopia from three locations, the Ethiopian News Agency said.\n“Nine civilians were killed and 12 others were injured during an operation that was launched with faulty intelligence,” members of the armed forces told the agency.\nSeveral soldiers have been suspended and are under investigation, it said, adding that a high-level military delegation had been dispatched to the area to launch an inquiry.\nThe Oromo Liberation Front is a secessionist group which the government has branded as terrorist.\nThe incident took place at a time when outbreaks of violence have continued to plague the country, mostly in Oromiya.\nLast month, Addis Ababa imposed a six-month, nationwide state of emergency to tamp down unrest in Africa’s second most populous nation.\nThe move was made a day after Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn announced his resignation in what he said was a bid to smooth the way for reforms.\nHis replacement is expected to be named this month.\nReporting by Aaron Maasho; Editing by Mark Potter\n ",
