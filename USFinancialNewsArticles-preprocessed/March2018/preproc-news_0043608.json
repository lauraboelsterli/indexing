    "text": "2 COMMENTS Regarding “ The Next Real-Estate Crisis: A Shortage of New Homes ” (page one, March 19): If the industry’s builders, subcontractors, remodelers and other industry leaders step up to embrace the need to invest in training the skilled workers they need to hire, problem solved. Home Builders Institute trains underserved populations for careers in the building industry. We currently place 85% of our graduates in the trades. While HBI instructors train about 5,000 students each year, we could dramatically increase that with more support from the industry.\nJohn Courson\nPresident and CEO\nHome Builders Institute\nWashington\nGiven current demographics, labor supply will have a hard time meeting labor demand. We need immigration reform. Washington made the labor-mobility crisis worse by taking away the tax deduction for work-related relocation. Local, state and federal officials also must improve access to vocational training to bring workers back to core industries like construction. Housing is the tip of the spear. It indicates where our economy is headed. Until policy makers get it right, supply will continue to be low and prices will continue to rise.\nTodd Hitt\nFalls Church, Va.",
