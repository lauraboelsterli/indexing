    "text": "SAN DIEGO, March 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ziyen Inc.’s Energy Division is proud to announce it has acquired the mineral rights to two more oil fields in Gibson County, Indiana. The total now stands at 7 oil (assets) fields held by the company. These acquisitions represent 77.4 acres and 25.2 acres and are in close proximity previously acquired leases.\nZiyen Inc.
