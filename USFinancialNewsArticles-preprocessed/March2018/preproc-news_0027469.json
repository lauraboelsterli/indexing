The closing of the Company’s initial public offering of 10,000,000 units is expected to occur on or about March 16, 2018. Each unit consists of one share of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.0001 (“Common Stock”), and one redeemable warrant (“Warrant”), with each Warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share. Each Unit will be sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit for aggregate gross proceeds of $100,000,000. Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the Common Stock and Warrants are expected to be traded on Nasdaq under the symbols “OPES” and “OPESW,” respectively.\nEarlyBirdCapital, Inc. acted as sole book-running manager of the offering.
