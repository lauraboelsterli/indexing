    "text": "ARLINGTON, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Surescripts continues to advance healthcare with the re-election of its Chief Administrative, Legal and Privacy Officer, Paul Uhrig, to The Sequoia Project Board of Directors. The Sequoia Project is a non-profit, 501(c)(3), public-private collaborative chartered to advance implementation of secure, interoperable nationwide health information exchange.\nAs Vice Chair of the Board, Uhrig supports The Sequoia Project’s multiple independent health IT interoperability initiatives, including the eHealth Exchange , a rapidly growing community of exchange partners who share information under a common trust framework and a common set of rules. Uhrig also helps oversee The Sequoia Project’s Carequality initiative, which counts Surescripts as one of its founding members. Carequality is a public-private collaborative building agreement among health IT data exchange programs to develop a common interoperability framework enabling seamless exchange among networks.\n“Our history, scale and experience allow us to work across the industry to facilitate the secure, seamless and open exchange of health information, while still fostering a competitive healthcare marketplace,” said Uhrig. “Our involvement in The Sequoia Project is an important part of advancing healthcare by convening, informing and advocating on behalf of the industry.”\nAs Surescripts' Chief Administrative, Legal and Privacy Officer, Uhrig oversees several key functions, including internal audit, legal, privacy, security, policy and government affairs. An early champion of health information technology, he pivoted from a law career to join Surescripts in its Arlington, Virginia, office in 2006. Uhrig also serves as chair of DirectTrust.\n“In an industry that is increasingly value based and quality focused, care providers must have the right patient information in real time to make the best decisions possible,” said Michael Matthews, President and Board Chair of The Sequoia Project. “As Vice Chair, Paul plays a critical role in helping us make comprehensive patient health information available to all clinicians.”\nAbout Surescripts\nOur purpose is to serve the nation with the single most trusted and capable health information network, built to increase patient safety, lower costs and ensure quality care. Since 2001, Surescripts has led the movement to turn data into actionable intelligence, and convened the Surescripts Network Alliance™ to enhance prescribing, inform care decisions and advance the healthcare industry.
