Prior-year historical Dell Technologies financials do not include EMC historical results for the first and second quarters and a portion of the third quarter in fiscal 2017, thereby impacting any year-over-year comparisons for the full year. EMC results are included for the full fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017, thereby year-over-year results are comparable for the fourth quarter.\n2 IDC WW Quarterly Personal Computing Device (PCD) Tracker CY17Q4\n3 DisplaySearch Desktop Monitor Market Tracker CY17Q3\n4 IDC WW Quarterly Server Tracker CY17Q4\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures:\nThis press release presents information about Dell Technologies' non-GAAP net revenue, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP net income from continuing operations, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures provided as a supplement to the results provided in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"GAAP\").
