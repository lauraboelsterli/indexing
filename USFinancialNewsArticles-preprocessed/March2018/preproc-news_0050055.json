    "text": "March 29 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp and other coffee companies must put a cancer warning label on coffee products sold in California, a Los Angeles judge ruled.\nSuperior Court Judge Elihu Berle said in a proposed decision Wednesday that Starbucks and other companies had failed to show that the threat from a chemical compound produced when roasting coffee was insignificant.\nStarbucks and other plaintiffs in the case have until April 10 to file objections.
