    "text": "149 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—A federal judge refused Wednesday to dismiss a lawsuit alleging President Donald Trump is violating the Constitution because his businesses are benefiting from his presidency, the first ruling to find that a litigant can sue the president on the issue.\nThe ruling by U.S. District Judge Peter Messitte found the state of Maryland and the District of Columbia had standing to bring claims against Mr. Trump, who hasn’t divested his business holdings. The plaintiffs allege Mr. Trump is violating constitutional clauses that prohibit the president from receiving emoluments—things of value—from foreign or state governments .\nJudge Messitte, a Clinton appointee based in Greenbelt, Md., said Maryland and D.C. had sufficiently alleged that the two jurisdictions and their residents were being harmed by the Trump International Hotel and related operations in the nation’s capital.\nRestaurants, hotels and hospitality workers “are being affected and will continue to be affected when foreign and state governments choose to stay, host events, or dine at the hotel rather than at comparable Maryland or District of Columbia establishments, in whole or in substantial part simply because of the President’s association with it,” the judge wrote.\nJudge Messitte made clear that his ruling resolved only one preliminary issue and that other of Mr. Trump’s arguments for the lawsuit’s dismissal would need to be addressed. The judge in the future may have to decide what constitutes an emolument and how the constitutional provisions apply to the president.\nAnd he placed some limits on the lawsuit. He said Maryland and D.C. could challenge only the business activities related to the Trump Hotel in D.C., not the Trump Organization’s operations in other locations.\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to comment on the ongoing litigation. The Justice Department is representing the president. “As we argued, we believe this case should be dismissed, and we will continue to defend the President in court,” a department spokeswoman said.\nThe department in court papers has argued that constitutional restrictions on emoluments weren’t intended to reach benefits arising from the president’s private business pursuits having nothing to do with his office.\nMaryland Attorney General Brian Frosh, a Democrat, said the ruling makes clear that Mr. Trump isn’t above the law.\n“We intend to hold him accountable,” Mr. Frosh said. “The whole point of the Emoluments Clauses is the president is supposed to put the interests of the American people first. Donald Trump is putting himself first.”\nWashington, D.C. attorney general Karl Racine, also a Democrat, said, “We will continue to seek an injunction to stop President Trump from flouting the Constitution’s original anti-corruption provisions.”\nWednesday’s ruling conflicts with a decision from a Manhattan federal judge last December. In that case, U.S. District Judge George Daniels, also a Clinton appointee, threw out similar claims filed by a government watchdog group and business competitors of Mr. Trump.\nThe New York decision said any alleged harms suffered by Mr. Trump’s challengers weren’t in “the zone of interests” that the Constitution’s emoluments provisions sought to protect.\nA third lawsuit is pending in Washington, D.C., filed by nearly 200 congressional Democrats last June.\nMr. Trump has pledged to donate profits from foreign governments to the U.S. Treasury. The Trump Organization earlier this month said it donated about $150,000 to the Treasury for its 2017 profits from foreign governments. Critics have argued the move is insufficient and lacks transparency.\nWrite to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com",
