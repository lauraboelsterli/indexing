    "text": "/ egypt How China could play a role \n“If the talks were to fail, or appear to be unraveling, at that point we could see Beijing move out of the background and try to play a more important role,” Peterson said. \nBut before that happens, he believes China could “attempt back channel communications with North Korea to help ensure a favorable outcome with talks.” \n“I wouldn’t necessarily term this as advising or counseling Kim Jong Un, I would say it will be more like pleasant background music,” Peterson stated. “For instance, they could tell their North Korean counterparts to manage expectations and think of talks in terms of long-term strategy.” \nBut if the North were to ally with Washington, China would surely step in. \nSuch a scenario “is not beyond possibility,” according to Walsh, who said he’s “heard talk like that from North Korean officials over the years.” China would surely attempt to prevent such an arrangement, he added. \nFriday’s editorial in the Global Times dismissed concerns of China “being marginalized” in the peace process, stating that it is unnecessary for Beijing to worry about North Korea “turning to the U.S.” ADVERTISEMENT",
