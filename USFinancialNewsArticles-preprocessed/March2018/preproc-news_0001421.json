    "text": "10 COMMENTS Olympic gold-medal-winning gymnast Aly Raisman filed a lawsuit Friday against the U.S. Olympic Committee, USA Gymnastics and others, seeking damages, among other things, for her alleged yearslong sexual abuse by former national-team doctor Larry Nassar.\nMs. Raisman, now 23 years old, is the second former Olympian, after her former teammate McKayla Maroney , to sue the U.S. Olympic Committee over the organization’s handling of the Nassar matter. Ms. Raisman alleges that USOC and USA Gymnastics leadership failed to act on complaints of Dr. Nassar’s inappropriate behavior and sexual misconduct, enabling him to continue to see and abuse patients.\nA spokesman for the USOC didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n“We are very sorry that any athlete has been hurt by the despicable crimes of Larry Nassar,” a spokeswoman for USA Gymnastics said in a statement. “USA Gymnastics is committed to doing everything we can to prevent this from happening again.”\nThe statement continued: “We need the gymnastics community to join with us to accomplish this for both the young men and women who are pursuing their gymnastics dreams today and to honor those who have gone before.”\nMs. Raisman’s lawsuit also names as defendants former USA Gymnastics President Steve Penny and the organization’s former board chairman, Paul Parilla , both of whom were forced out of the organization under pressure over their response to the Nassar allegations. Mr. Parilla and a lawyer for Mr. Penny didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\nU.S. Olympic Gold Medalist Aly Raisman blasted the USOC and USA Gymnastics in a Lansing, Mich., courtroom on Friday before the sentencing of former team doctor Larry Nassar. Photo: AP Dr. Nassar was arrested on state sexual-abuse charges in Michigan in November 2016, more than a year after U.S. national-team gymnasts, including Ms. Raisman and Ms. Maroney, raised concerns about his medical treatment to USA Gymnastics in June 2015.\nAccording to people familiar with the matter, the FBI learned of the allegations from USA Gymnastics in July 2015. The bureau this week launched an internal review into its handling of the allegations.\nDr. Nassar pleaded guilty last year to the state charges and to federal child-pornography counts, and is now serving a 60 year federal prison term .\nMs. Raisman went public with her allegations against Dr. Nassar last fall, and was one of more than 150 victims to speak at his January sentencing in Michigan state court.\nIn the lawsuit, Ms. Raisman alleges that, between 2010 and 2015, Dr. Nassar regularly put his bare hand on her unclothed genital area during treatment sessions, at times appearing to have an erection.\nHer allegations echo those of scores of women who have alleged, in lawsuits and court appearances, that the osteopathic physician—who has since lost his medical license—abused them under the pretense of providing treatment. USA Gymnastics is named as a defendant in most of those suits. More than 200 women have filed reports about Dr. Nassar with Michigan police.\nRelated\nFBI Opens Internal Review of Handling of Gymnasts’ Sex-Abuse Allegations (March 1) U.S. Olympic Committee Chief Resigns (Feb. 28) Education Department to Investigate Michigan State University Over Nassar Scandal (Feb. 26) In a statement, Ms. Raisman said she hoped her lawsuit would force the organizations to change. She has called for an outside investigation into the USOC and USA Gymnastics. Her lawsuit also seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, including possible court supervision of the USOC and USA Gymnastics.\n“It has become painfully clear that these organizations have no intention of properly addressing the problem” of athlete safety, she said. “After all this time, they remain unwilling to conduct a full investigation.”\nThe USOC recently launched an internal investigation into its handling of the Nassar matter. Ms. Raisman and others, though, have declined to participate in that review, saying they didn’t trust the USOC to be impartial or thorough.",
