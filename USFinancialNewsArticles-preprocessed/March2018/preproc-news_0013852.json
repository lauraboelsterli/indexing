    "text": "VANCOUVER, March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Northern Vertex Mining Corp. (TSX.V:NEE) (OTC Nasdaq Intl.: NHVCF) (the \"Company\") announces that the Company's unaudited interim consolidated financial results for the second fiscal quarter 2018 ended December 31, 2017 have been filed on SEDAR. The full version of the Condensed Interim Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's Discussion & Analysis can be viewed on the Company's website at www.northernvertex.com or under the Company's profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nFinancial Highlights for the Quarter and Six Months Ended December 31, 2017\nCash was $22.20 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $24.99 million at June 30, 2017. The decrease was due to cash used for the construction of the Moss Mine, offset by the receipt of cash proceeds from the various financings.\nLoss for the quarter was $0.80 million ($0.00 per share) compared to a loss of $0.89 million ($0.01 per share) for the same period last year.\nLoss for the six months was $3.35 million ($0.02 per share) compared to a loss of $1.81 million ($0.02 per share) for the same period last year.\nThe Company received the fourth and final tranche in the amount of US$5 million from Sprott Private Resource Lending (Collector), LP under its senior secured credit facility. The US$20 million Sprott facility is now fully drawn.\nThe Company received funding under a definitive Master Lease Agreement with Caterpillar Financial Services Corporation to fund the Company's purchase of diesel generators, the crushing plant and various mobile equipment.\nConstruction costs for the six months relating to equipment purchases, site earthworks and facility construction were $41.55 million and development and exploration costs incurred on the Moss Mine and Silver Creek Projects during the six months were $0.73 million.\nCorporate and Operating Highlights for the Quarter Ended December 31, 2017\nThe crushing plant was mechanically completed which included the installation of the 4 crushing units, three rock boxes, 14 conveyors and the agglomeration circuit. The remaining electrical work was also nearing completion.\nThe leach pad was substantially completed and was ready to receive ore upon the commencement of crushing and agglomeration operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 (ie. the first calendar quarter of 2018).\nThe mechanical and electrical components for agglomerated ore transport and stacking are onsite and have been assembled. The radial stacker and grasshoppers were positioned ready to commence ore stacking.\nThe Merrill Crowe plant and refinery were nearing mechanical completion and the electrical work is progressing well which includes the programable logic controllers wiring.\nAn NI 43-101 Preliminary Economic Analysis was released of the technical and economic viability of expanding the Moss Mine to include resources that could be accessed by a future expansion of operations onto the Company's adjacent unpatented mining claims.\nThe Company entered into a definitive agreement in respect of an unsecured subordinated non-revolving loan Working Capital Facility in the amount of US$6 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2017, the Company drew an initial advance of US$3 million which was evidenced by way of a convertible debenture and, in addition, provided notice of its intention to draw the remaining balance of US$3 million.\nThe Company also reports that it has accelerated the issuance of common shares under its previously announced agreement with La Cuesta International Inc. (\"La Cuesta\") (see Company's news release dated October 16, 2017). A total of 200,000 common shares will be issued, valued at the closing price of the common shares of the Company at the date of the agreement being $0.65 per share. The common shares are issuable for exploration services provided by La Cuesta including access to La Cuesta's Proprietary Resource Data Bank of the Oatman District and are subject to TSX Venture Exchange approval.\nAbout Northern Vertex:\nNorthern Vertex Mining Corp. is an exploration and mining company focused on the reactivation of its 100% owned Moss Mine Gold/Silver Project located in NW Arizona, USA. The Company's management comprises an experienced management team with a strong background in all aspects of acquisition, exploration, development, operations and financing of mining projects worldwide.
