The Company also uses Non-GAAP gross profit and Non-GAAP gross-margin, non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the effect of intangible asset amortization. Sphere 3D uses the above non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate the business. Management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review, as applicable, both GAAP information and the non-GAAP measures in order to assess the performance of continuing operations and for planning and forecasting in future periods. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures is intended to provide investors with an understanding of the Company’s operational results and trends that enables them to analyze the base financial and operating performance and facilitate period-to-period comparisons and analysis of operational trends. Sphere 3D believes the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency with respect to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered substitutes for or superior to GAAP results. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures utilized by other companies since such other companies may not calculate such measures in the same manner as we do.\nInvestors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, which are provided in the attached table after the text of this release.\nAdditional Information\nOn February 20, 2018, Sphere 3D Corp.
