Data collected thus far from the THINK trial, which started in early 2017, show that CYAD-01 has been well-tolerated, offers an excellent safety profile and validates the activity of the NKG2D receptor.\nAt year-end 2017, there were no critical toxicity events related to the CYAD-01 product candidate reported by the THINK trial investigators. More importantly, the first signs of clinical activity were reported in both arms of the trial.\nIn the hematological arm of the THINK trial, Celyad announced in October 2017 a world’s first with the complete response in a patient with refractory and relapsed AML, obtained without preconditioning chemotherapy or other anti-tumor treatments combined with CYAD-01. Furthermore, preliminary signs of clinical activity were observed in all AML patients dosed in 2017. In the solid arm, cases of stable disease (SD) were reported in patients suffering from ovarian cancer and colorectal cancer.\nCelyad also made important progress on its IP position with the announcement of a non-exclusive license agreement with Novartis and three new patents covering the allogeneic CAR-T cell approach.\nIn terms of financing, Celyad reported €34 million at year end 2017. This, together with anticipated milestone payments expected to be received by Celyad in 2018 from its strategic partners, should enable the company to finance all its clinical programs and other needs through the first half of 2019.\nHere are the operational and financial highlights of 2017 identified by the company’s board of directors:\nClinical Developments\nData collected in 2017 from the THINK trial showed that CYAD-01 has been well-tolerated to date and validated activity of the NKG2D CAR. In October, Celyad achieved an important milestone in oncology with the first ever complete response in a patient with refractory and relapsed AML, obtained without preconditioning chemotherapy or other anti-tumor treatments combined with CYAD-01. Importantly, clinical activity has been observed in AML patients dosed in 2017, with all patients seeing a reduction in their blast counts in the bone marrow and/or improvements in their hematological parameters. Data for the THINK trial showed preliminary signs of activity of CYAD-01 in solid tumors. Stabilization of the disease was observed in an ovarian patient and in colorectal cancer patients. In late-2017, Celyad initiated the SHRINK trial, an open-label Phase 1 trial evaluating the safety and clinical activity of multiple doses of CYAD-01, administered concurrently with the neoadjuvant standard FOLFOX chemotherapy treatment in patients with potentially resectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer. The trial includes a dose escalation and an extension stage.\nThe dose escalation design will include three dose-levels of CYAD-01: 1x10 8 , 3x10 8 and 1x10 9 CYAD-01 per administration. At each dose-level, patients will receive three successive administrations, two weeks apart, at the specified dose administered at a specific timing within the FOLFOX cycle. The dose escalation portion of the trial is designed to enrol three patients per dose level and the extension phase is expected to enrol twenty-one additional patients. SHRINK is being conducted in key oncology centers in Belgium.\nIntellectual property\nIn January, the U.S. Patent and Trade Office (USPTO) upheld, for a third time, Celyad’s U.S. Patent No. 9,181,527 relating to allogeneic human primary T-cells that are engineered to be TCR-deficient and express a CAR. In March, the USPTO rejected another request for a re-examination of the same patent. In May, Celyad obtained a new patent related to its method of treating cancer by administering allogeneic primary human T cells that are engineered to be TCR-deficient and to express a CAR. U.S. Patent no. 9,663,763 is the third patent in Celyad’s allogeneic intellectual property portfolio awarded by the USPTO. This new patent claims specific methods of treating cancer patients with allogeneic TCR-deficient CAR-T immunotherapies.\nThe combination of this patent with earlier granted U.S. patents, consolidates Celyad’s strong intellectual property position in the allogeneic CAR-T field and strengthens the Celyad’s IP portfolio covering key elements in the allogeneic TCR-deficient CAR-T cells production value chain.\nCorporate and financial highlights\nIn May, Celyad announced a non-exclusive license agreement with Novartis regarding U.S. patents related to allogeneic CAR-T cells. The agreement includes Celyad’s intellectual property rights under U.S. Patent No. 9,181,527. This agreement is related to two undisclosed targets currently under development by Novartis.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Celyad received an upfront payment and is eligible to receive payments in aggregate amounts of up to $96 million. In addition, Celyad is eligible to receive single digit percentage royalties based on net sales of the licensed target. Celyad retains all rights to grant further licenses to third parties for the use of allogeneic CAR-T cells. In August, Celyad amended its agreements with Celdara Medical LLC and Dartmouth College related to the CAR-T NK cell drug product candidates and related technology licensed in January 2015 following the acquisition of OnCyte LLC. Under the amended agreements Celyad is entitled to receive an increased share of future revenues generated by these assets, including revenues from its sub-licensees. In return, Celyad paid Celdara Medical LLC and Dartmouth College an upfront payment of $12.5 million (€10.6 million) and issued to Celdara Medical LLC $12.5 million worth of Celyad’s ordinary shares at a share price of €32.35.\nFinancial highlights\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2017, our revenues generated by our strategic collaborations amounted to €3.5 million and corresponded to the non-refundable upfront payment received from Novartis, as a result of the non-exclusive license agreement signed in May 2017. The revenues of 2016 corresponded to the payment received from ONO.\nIn 2017, our research and development expenses decreased by €4.7 million at €23.0 million compared to 2016. The general and administrative expenses are almost stable over the 2 periods.\nAs a result, the operating loss of our recurring operations (REBIT) amounted to €26.6 million compared to €25.6 million in 2016.\nIn 2017, we recognized non-recurring expenses related to the amendment of the agreements with Celdara Medical, LLC and Dartmouth College and the write-off of the C-Cure and Corquest assets together with the derecognition of related liabilities (respectively for €24.3 million, €0.7 million and €1.2 million). There were no non-recurring items in the income statement of 2016.\nAt year end 2017, the loss from operations before financial results and taxes (EBIT) amounted to €52.9 million versus €25.6 million in 2016.\nThe 2017 financial income & charges covered mainly interest received on cash deposits and currency exchange rates differences and bank charges. Due the depreciation of the USD compared to EUR, the Group recognized an unrealized loss on foreign exchange differences of €4.4 million in 2017. In 2016, the unrealized gain on foreign exchange differences amounted to €0.8 million.\nTaking into account the net financial loss, the net loss of 2017 amounted to €56.4 million versus a net loss of €23.6 million for same period in 2016.\nFor 2018, we expect to receive additional sublicensing income from our strategic partners and a reasonable increase of our operating expenses, mainly research and development expenses as we will be running multiple clinical trials in parallel.\nCash and short-term deposits were €34 million as of 31 December 2017.\nAnnual Report 2017\nCelyad plans to publish its audited Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2017 on 6 April 2018. The statutory auditor, BDO Réviseurs d’Entreprises SCCRL, represented by Bert Kegels, has confirmed that the audit, which is substantially complete, has not to date revealed any material misstatement in the draft consolidated financial statements, and that the accounting data reported in the press release are consistent, in all material respects, with the draft consolidated financial statements from which it has been derived.\n***END***\nConsolidated statement of financial position\n(€’000) As of 31 December 2017 2016 NON-CURRENT ASSETS 41,232 53,440 Intangible assets 36,508 49,566 Property, Plant and Equipment 3,290 3,563 Other non-current assets 1,434 311 CURRENT ASSETS 36,394 85,367 Trade and Other Receivables 233 1,359 Other current assets 2,255 1,420 Short-term investment 10,653 34,230 Cash and cash equivalents 23,253 48,357 TOTAL ASSETS 77,626 138,806 EQUITY 47,535 90,885 Share Capital 34,337 32,571 Share premium 170,297 158,010 Other reserves 23,322 24,329 Retained loss (180,421) (124,026) NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES 22,146 36,646 Bank loans 326 536 Finance leases 482 381 Advances repayable 1,544 7,330 Contingent consideration liability 19,583 28,179 Post employment benefits 204 204 Other non-current liabilities 7 16 CURRENT LIABILITIES 7,945 11,275 Bank loans 209 207 Finance leases 427 354 Advances repayable 226 1,108 Trade payables 4,800 8,098 Other current liabilities 2,282 1,508 TOTAL EQUITY AND LIABILITIES 77,626 138,806 [1] For 2017 and 2016, the Group does not have any non-controlling interests and the losses for the year are fully attributable\nto owners of the parent.\nConsolidated statement of the comprehensive loss\n(€’000) For the year ended 31 December 2017 2016 Revenues 3,540 8,523 Cost of Sales (515) (53) Gross profit 3,025 8,471 Research and Development expenses (22,908) (27,675) General and administrative expenses (9,310) (9,744) Other operating income 2,590 3,340 Operating Loss before non-recurring items -
