Stabilized Rental NOI Margin and Stabilized Rental Core FFO are non-GAAP performance measures that Front Yard believes are useful to assist investors in gaining an understanding of the trends and operating metrics for Front Yard’s core business. Stabilized Rental NOI Margin and Stabilized Rental Core FFO should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, Front Yard’s reported results under U.S. GAAP.\nThe following provides related definitions of, and a reconciliation of Front Yard’s U.S. GAAP results to, Stabilized Rental NOI Margin and Stabilized Rental Core FFO for the periods presented:\nStabilized Rental: We define a property as stabilized once it has been renovated and then initially leased or available for rent for a period greater than 90 days. All other homes are considered non-stabilized. Homes are considered stabilized even after subsequent resident turnover. However, homes may be removed from the stabilized home portfolio and placed in the non-stabilized home portfolio due to renovation during the home lifecycle or because they are held for sale.\nStabilized Rental Net Operating Income (“Stabilized Rental NOI”) and Stabilized Rental NOI Margin: Stabilized Rental NOI is a non-GAAP supplemental measure that we define as rental revenues less residential property operating expenses of the stabilized rental properties in our rental portfolio. We define Stabilized Rental NOI Margin as Stabilized Rental NOI divided by rental revenues.\nWe consider Stabilized Rental NOI and Stabilized Rental NOI Margin to be meaningful supplemental measures of operating performance because they reflect the operating performance of our stabilized properties without allocation of corporate level overhead or general and administrative costs, acquisition fees and other similar costs and provide insight to the ongoing operations of our business. These measures should be used only as supplements to and not substitutes for net income or loss or net cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. These net operating income measures should not be used as indicators of funds available to fund cash needs, including distributions and dividends. Although we may use these non-GAAP measures to compare our performance to other real estate investment trusts (“REITs”), not all REITs may calculate these non-GAAP measures in the same way, and there is no assurance that our calculation is comparable with that of other REITs. While management believes that our calculations are reasonable, there is no standard calculation methodology for Stabilized Rental NOI Margin, and different methodologies could produce materially different results.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net loss as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP to Stabilized Rental NOI and Stabilized Rental NOI Margin:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 GAAP net loss $ (37,474 ) Adjustments: Change in unrealized gain on mortgage loans 33,039 Net realized gain on mortgage loans (10,947 ) Net realized gain on sales of real estate (14,781 ) Interest income (152 ) Non-stabilized rental and REO operating expenses 4,390 Real estate depreciation and amortization 16,313 Acquisition fees and costs 119 Selling costs and impairment 9,422 Mortgage loan servicing costs 1,011 Interest expense 14,617 Share-based compensation 1,315 General and administrative 2,338 Management fees to AAMC 3,924 Insurance recoveries related to natural disasters (463 ) Income tax benefit (16 ) Stabilized Rental NOI $ 22,655 Rental revenues $ 34,917 Stabilized Rental NOI Margin 64.9 % Stabilized Rental FFO and Stabilized Rental Core FFO : Funds from Operations (“FFO”) is a supplemental performance measure of an equity REIT used by industry analysts and investors in order to facilitate meaningful comparisons between periods and among peer companies. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) as GAAP net income or loss excluding gains or losses from sales of property, impairment charges on real estate and depreciation and amortization on real estate assets adjusted for unconsolidated partnerships and jointly owned investments.\nWe believe that the FFO of our stabilized rental portfolio (“Stabilized Rental FFO”) is a meaningful supplemental measure of the operating performance of our stabilized rental portfolio because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time, as reflected through depreciation. Because real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, management considers Stabilized Rental FFO an appropriate supplemental performance measure because it excludes historical cost depreciation, impairment charges and gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated homes from GAAP net income. By excluding depreciation, impairment and gains or losses on sales of real estate, Stabilized Rental FFO provides a measure of returns on our investments in stabilized real estate assets. However, because Stabilized Rental FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the homes that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures to maintain the operating performance of the homes, all of which have real economic effect and could materially affect our results from operations, the utility of Stabilized Rental FFO as a measure of our performance is limited.\nOur Stabilized Rental Core FFO begins with Stabilized Rental FFO and is adjusted for share-based compensation, acquisition fees and costs, non-cash interest expense related to deferred debt issuance costs and other non-comparable items, as applicable. We believe that Stabilized Rental Core FFO, when used in conjunction with the results of operations under GAAP, is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance for the same reasons as Stabilized Rental FFO and is further helpful as it provides a consistent measurement of our performance across reporting periods by removing the impact of certain items that are not comparable from period to period.\nAlthough management believes that FFO and Stabilized Rental Core FFO increase our comparability with other companies, these measures may not be comparable to the FFO or core FFO of other companies because 1) we apply FFO and Stabilized Rental Core FFO to only our stabilized rental portfolio and 2) other companies may adopt a definition of FFO other than the NAREIT definition, may apply a different method of determining core FFO or may utilize metrics other than or in addition to core FFO.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net loss as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP to Stabilized Rental Core FFO:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 GAAP net loss $ (37,474 ) Adjustments to determine Stabilized Rental FFO: Change in unrealized gain on mortgage loans 33,039 Net realized gain on mortgage loans (10,947 ) Net realized gain on sales of real estate (14,781 ) Interest income (152 ) Non-stabilized rental and REO operating expenses 4,390 Real estate depreciation and amortization 16,313 Selling costs and impairment 9,422 Mortgage loan servicing costs 1,011 Insurance recoveries related to natural disasters (463 ) Other expenses 4,796 Stabilized Rental FFO 5,154 Adjustments to determine Stabilized Rental Core FFO: Conversion fees 90 Non-cash interest expense 1,097 Share-based compensation 738 Other adjustments 694 Stabilized Rental Core FFO $ 7,773 Weighted average common stock outstanding - basic and diluted 53,447,950 Stabilized Rental Core FFO per share - basic and diluted $ 0.15\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:\nRobin N.
