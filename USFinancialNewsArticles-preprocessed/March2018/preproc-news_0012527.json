    "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s Hainan provincial government does not intend to offer support to cash-strapped, aviation-to-financial services conglomerate HNA Group [HNAIRC.UL], Vice Governor Mao Chaofeng said on Tuesday.\nFILE PHOTO: A HNA Group logo is seen on the building of HNA Plaza in Beijing, China February 9, 2018. REUTERS/Jason Lee/File Photo Mao, asked on the sidelines of China’s annual meeting of parliament whether the provincial government will offer support to HNA, said the government will not interfere in a company’s operations and cannot contravene the rules of the market economy.\nMao said, however, there should not be any problems for HNA Group given the quality of its assets and the current situation.\nHNA, which is based in Hainan, has been selling assets and shareholdings, while restructuring its widespread operations, following a $50 billion investment spree that left the company in a precarious cash crunch.\nReporting by Ben Blanchard and Matthew Miller; Writing by Beijing Monitoring Desk; Editing by Kim COghill\n ",
