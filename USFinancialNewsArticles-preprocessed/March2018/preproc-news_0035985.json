    "text": "TORONTO, March 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Partners Value Investments LP (the “Partnership”) (TSX-V:PVF.UN) announced today its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017. All amounts are stated in US dollars.\nNet income for the year was $80 million, of which $58 million was attributable to the Equity Limited Partners ($0.65 per Equity LP unit) compared to $73 million ($0.82 per Equity LP unit) in the prior year. The decrease in net income is due to the impact of translating our Canadian dollar denominated preferred share liabilities at a higher rate due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar versus our US dollar reporting currency. Ignoring this impact, we recorded modestly higher net income after-tax in 2017.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nFor the years ended December 31\n(Thousands)\n2017 2016 Investment income Dividends $ 87,666 $ 61,942 Other investment income 2,142 5,228 89,808 67,170 Expenses Operating expenses (13,419 ) (15,270 ) Financing costs (5,358 ) (2,116 ) Retractable preferred share dividends (27,341 ) (25,289 ) 43,690 24,495 Other items Investment valuation gains (losses) 87,784 72,967 Amortization of deferred financing costs (2,473 ) (1,834 ) Change in value of fund unit liability — (896 ) Income taxes (20,059 ) (22,394 ) Income from equity accounted income 253 — Foreign currency gains (losses) (29,112 ) 13,393 Net income (loss) $ 80,083 $ 85,731 Net income (loss) attributable to: Partners Value Investments Inc. $ — $ 51,198 Equity Limited Partners 57,790 21,315 General Partner — — Preferred Limited Partners 22,293 13,218 $ 80,083 $ 85,731 Financial Profile and Net Book Value\nThe Partnership’s principal investment is its interest in 86 million Class A Limited Voting Shares (“Brookfield shares”) of Brookfield Asset Management Inc.
