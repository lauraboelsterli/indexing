    "text": "WALNUT CREEK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Central Garden & Pet Company (NASDAQ: CENT) (NASDAQ: CENTA), a leading innovator, producer, and distributor of branded and private label products for the lawn & garden and pet supplies markets, announced today that it has purchased Bell Nursery Holdings, LLC, the largest commercial grower of flowers and plants in the mid-Atlantic. Bell is headquartered in Maryland and has facilities in North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Ohio and Delaware. The Company expects the acquisition to be accretive in fiscal 2018.\n“We are excited to add Bell Nursery’s live plant business to Central’s broad garden products portfolio,” said George Roeth, President & CEO of Central Garden & Pet. “We view the live plant area as an attractive growth opportunity that is growing faster than the overall garden industry and is synergistic with our existing garden portfolio.

We look forward to working with the management team at Bell, who are remaining with the company, to grow the business profitably in the years ahead.”\nAbout Central Garden & Pet\nCentral Garden & Pet Company is a leading innovator, producer and distributor of branded and private label products for the lawn & garden and pet supplies markets.
