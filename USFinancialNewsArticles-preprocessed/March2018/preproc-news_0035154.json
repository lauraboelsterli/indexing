    "text": "  5:13 p.m. ET Share \nFinancial site valued at $160 million \nBy Benjamin Mullin \nCheddar, the financial news streaming service aimed at millennials, is preparing to expand internationally and launch a channel on Snapchat Discover after securing a new investment round. \nRoughly two years after its launch as a self-described “post-cable network,” Cheddar has raised $22 million, according to founder and Chief Executive Jon Steinberg. \nThe funding round, the company’s fourth, was led by Raine Ventures, an early-stage media-and-technology investment firm. Other investors include Liberty Global, Goldman Sachs GS, -1.89% , Antenna Group, 7 Global Capital, Dentsu Ventures, New York Stock Exchange owner Jeffrey Sprecher and Kelly Loeffler, chief communications and marketing officer of Intercontinental Exchange. Previously, Cheddar raised $32 million in three rounds led by Lightspeed Venture Partners and Raine Ventures. \nThe company is now valued at $160 million, up from $85 million after the last fundraising round, Steinberg said.",
