    "text": "NEW YORK, March 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Rivetz, a pioneer in trusted computing and embedded cyber security, today announced it has acquired the assets of CyberDeadbolt, a Silicon Valley-based cyber security startup utilizing social encryption for the transfer and protection of digital assets. The acquisition enables Rivetz to bring the human touch to its hardware-based cyber security solutions and recovery models.\nThe CyberDeadbolt secure, scalable platform incorporates human factors to authenticate and authorize the exchange of sensitive information, employing phonetics-based voice identification and multi-person authentication to provide customizable levels of security depending on the user's needs. CyberDeadbolt provides a new paradigm for account recovery, recovered device unlocking and verified multi-user access intent. The app also allows users to enable a cyber 'deadbolt' to lock access to all or some of their devices. For example, a user may lock their home devices while away on vacation.\n\"The foundation of the Rivetz service relies on known devices in known conditions to protect digital assets like Bitcoin,\" said Steven Sprague, founder and CEO of Rivetz. \"With CyberDeadbolt, we now have the ability to add secure user intent to access that user's collection of devices and incorporate known and verified multiple human access confirmations as well.\"\n\"Rivetz and CyberDeadbolt are a natural fit and yield a compelling combination,\" said Bradley Rotter, CyberDeadbolt cofounder and a crypto and blockchain pioneer. \"The Rivetz model of provable controls benefits from the simple and easy-to-operate capabilities delivered by CyberDeadbolt to remotely lock a device or require multiple users to participate in the recovery of keys and secrets.\"\nPavan Mudanna, CyberDeadbolt cofounder, has joined the Rivetz team as vice president of shared services. Rotter is vice chairman of the Rivetz board.\nAbout Rivetz\nRivetz is focused on solving problems associated with consumer and machine-to-machine digital transactions. Rivetz technology and services aim to provide a safer and easier-to-use model for all users to protect their digital assets using hardware-based trusted execution technology. The device aims to play a critical role in automating security and enabling the controls that users need to benefit from modern services. Rivetz leverages state-of-the-art cyber security tools to develop a modern model for users and their devices to interact with services on the Internet.

Where humans have previously been considered the weakest link in security, CyberDeadbolt leverages human authenticators as dynamic, individualized and immutable. Its open infrastructure integrates and adapts to new technologies for applications in virtually any form of data protection.\nAll trademarks and product names are the property of their respective companies.\nMedia Contact:\nNikki Dance\nFortyThree, Inc.\n831.401.3175\nRivetz@43pr.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/rivetz-acquires-cyberdeadbolt-300610084.html\nSOURCE Rivetz",
