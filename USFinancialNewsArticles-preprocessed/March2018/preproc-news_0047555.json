    "text": "TORONTO, March 28 (Reuters) - Ontario will increase its already large debt burden in 2018-19 as it returns to running a deficit and adds to its investment in infrastructure, the province’s budget showed on Wednesday.\nThe province projects that net debt-to-GDP, which had been on a downward path and is seen as a key measure of fiscal health, will increase to 37.6 percent in 2018-19 from 37.1 percent in 2017-18 and then continue to climb until peaking at 38.9 percent in 2021-22.\nThe rising profile of net debt to the size of the economy came as the province, which has one of the largest sub-sovereign debts in the world, projected deficits over the coming six years in a pre-election budget that boosted spending on healthcare and child care.\nIt forecast a budget surplus in 2017-18 for the first time in a decade.\nBy comparison, the province of Quebec said on Tuesday it will tap a fund to reduce its debt by C$10 billion ($7.74 billion) over the next five years. It projected a balanced budget in 2018-19.\n“I think Quebec’s yields will continue to be below Ontario for quite some time,” said Sebastien Lavoie, chief economist at Laurentian Bank.\nThe lower yields for Quebec allow it to borrow at a cheaper rate.\nOntario projected that investment in capital assets will rise to C$14.2 billion in the coming fiscal year from an estimated C$10.7 billion in 2017-18.\nIt projected borrowing of C$31.7 billion in 2018-19, which is lower than for the current fiscal year after C$11.5 billion was prefunded.\nInterest on debt is forecast to rise to C$12.5 billion in 2018-19 from an estimate of nearly C$12 billion in 2017-18, while the Canadian dollar borrowing target will be maintained at about two-thirds of total borrowing, the province said.
