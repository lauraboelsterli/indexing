    "text": "OLD GREENWICH, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ellington Financial LLC (NYSE: EFC) (\"Ellington Financial\" or the \"Company\") today announced that its estimated book value per common share as of February 28, 2018 was $19.35, or $19.05 on a diluted basis. Estimated book value per share on a diluted basis takes into account securities convertible into the Company's common shares. These amounts give effect to the previously announced dividend in the amount of $0.41 per common share and convertible security, payable on March 15, 2018 to holders of record on March 1, 2018, with an ex-dividend date of February 28, 2018. These estimates are subject to change upon completion of the Company's month-end valuation procedures relating to its investment positions, and any such change could be material. There can be no assurance that the Company's estimated book value per common share as of February 28, 2018 is indicative of what the Company's results are likely to be for the three month period ending March 31, 2018 or in future periods, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise its estimated book value per common share prior to issuance of financial statements for such periods.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
