    "text": "MAROUSSI, ATHENS, Greece, March 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Euroseas Ltd. (NASDAQ:ESEA) (the “Company” or “Euroseas”), an owner and operator of drybulk and container carrier vessels and provider of seaborne transportation for drybulk and containerized cargoes, announced today its results for the three month period and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights:\nTotal net revenues of $13.5 million. Net income attributable to common shareholders of $1.5 million or $0.13 earnings per share basic and diluted. This income includes, amongst other items, a $0.5 million dividend on Series B Preferred Shares and a $0.3 million gain on the sale of M/V Aggeliki P. Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders 1 for the period was $1.1 million or $0.10 earnings per share basic and diluted. Adjusted EBITDA 1 was $4.4 million. An average of 16.3 vessels were owned and operated during the fourth quarter of 2017 earning an average time charter equivalent rate of $9,083 per day. The Company declared its sixteenth dividend of $0.5 million on its Series B Preferred Shares; the dividend was paid in-kind by issuing additional Series B Preferred Shares.\nFull year 2017 Highlights:\nTotal net revenues of $42.9 million. Net loss attributable to common shareholders of $7.9 million or $0.71 loss per share basic and diluted. This loss includes, among other items, a $1.8 million dividend on Series B Preferred Shares and a $4.6 million loss on write-down of M/V Aggeliki P and M/V Monica P, which were held for sale since September 30, 2017. M/V Aggeliki P was sold in December 2017. Adjusted net loss attributable to common shareholders 1 for the period was $4.2 million or $0.38 loss per share basic and diluted. Adjusted EBITDA 1 was $9.3 million. An average of 14.2 vessels were owned and operated during the twelve months of 2017 earning an average time charter equivalent rate of $8,290 per day.\nAristides Pittas, Chairman and CEO of Euroseas, commented: “During the last quarter of 2017, Euroseas returned to profitability not only because of the recovery of the drybulk and containership markets but also due to its continuous efforts to control its operating, financial and capital cost structure and cash flows. We believe that, over the last couple of years, we have positioned the Company to benefit from the unfolding market recovery by renewing and expanding our fleet in both sectors we operate. In the drybulk sector, after the upcoming delivery of our Kamsarmax newbuilding and the planned sale of our elder handymax unit, we will own a fleet of six vessels from ultramax to kamsarmax size, three Chinese-built in the last two years and three Japanese-built of 2000-04 vintage. In the containership sector, we have a fleet of eleven medium age and elder feeder units that produce earnings at present market levels with low capital investment. ”\n“At the same time, we are optimistic about the prospects for both bulkers and containerships as demand for ships is expected by most analysts to remain strong over the next couple of years on the back of strong worldwide economic growth and modest supply pressure. As we have stated in the past, we believe, we can provide a publicly-listed consolidation platform in both sectors. The latter along with accretive acquisitions remain our main strategy for 2018.”\nTasos Aslidis, Chief Financial Officer of Euroseas, commented: “The operating results of the fourth quarter of 2017 reflect the recovered level of charter rates in both the drybulk and containership markets. On average during the fourth quarter of 2017, our vessels earned 19.4% higher time charter equivalent rates than in the fourth quarter of 2016.”\n“Total daily vessel operating expenses, including management fees, general and administrative expenses, but excluding drydocking costs, decreased approximately 4.6% during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter of last year, while for the full year 2017 the decrease was approximately 3.8%. As always, we want to emphasize that cost control remains a key component of our strategy.”\n“As of December 31, 2017, our outstanding debt (excluding the unamortized loan fees) was $74.4 million versus restricted and unrestricted cash of approximately $13.2 million. We complied with all our debt covenants as of December 31, 2017.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results:\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company reported total net revenues of $13.5 million representing a 85.2% increase over total net revenues of $7.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company reported a net income for the period of $2.0 million and a net income attributable to common shareholders of $1.5 million, as compared to a net loss of $17.6 million and a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $18.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. On average, 16.3 vessels were owned and operated during the fourth quarter of 2017 earning an average time charter equivalent rate of $9,083 per day compared to 12.1 vessels in the same period of 2016 earning an average time charter equivalent rate of $7,609 per day.\nThe results for the fourth quarter of 2017 include a $0.1 million net gain on derivatives and a $0.3 million net gain on sale of a vessel, as compared to a $0.1 million net gain on derivatives, a $5.9 million loss on write-down of vessel held for sale, a $3.8 million loss on termination of a shipbuilding contract and a $4.5 million impairment loss in other investment and investment in joint venture for the same period of 2016.\nDepreciation expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $1.9 million, compared to the $2.2 million for the same period of 2016. Although the average number of vessels increased, the new vessels acquired have a lower average daily depreciation charge as a result of their lower initial values (acquisition price) and greater remaining useful life (i.e. m/v Alexandros P) compared to the remaining vessels. In the fourth quarter of 2017, there was no equity loss in joint venture as compared to equity loss of $1.0 million and impairment loss in other investment and investment in joint venture of $4.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, as in 2016, the Company concluded that its equity investment in Euromar and the invested portion of its investment in preferred units of Euromar were entirely impaired and hence the Company ceased recognising income on the preferred units. Euromar is a wholly owned subsidiary of Euroseas since September 2017, but its vessels were substantially under the control of its lenders and were all sold by the end of 2017, and, thus, it has not been consolidated in our results nor any gain or loss from it has been recognized.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $4.4 million compared to $(0.6) million for the same of the fourth quarter of 2016. Please see below for Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation to net loss and cash flow provided by operating activities.\nBasic and diluted earnings per share attributable to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.13 calculated on 11,113,718 basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding, compared to basic and diluted loss per share of $2.17 for the fourth quarter of 2016, calculated on 8,312,708 basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding.\nExcluding the effect on the income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders for the quarter of the net gain on derivatives, the net gain on sale of a vessel, the loss on termination of a shipbuilding contract, the loss on write-down of vessels held for sale and the impairment loss of other investment and investment in joint venture, the adjusted earnings per share attributable to common shareholders for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 would have been $0.10 per share basic and diluted compared to net loss of $0.47 per share basic and diluted for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Usually, security analysts do not include the above items in their published estimates of earnings per share.\nFull Year 2017 Results:\nFor the full year of 2017, the Company reported total net revenues of $42.9 million representing a 51.0% increase over total net revenues of $28.4 million during the twelve months of 2016. The Company reported a net loss for the period of $6.1 million and a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $7.9 million, as compared to a net loss of $44.2 million and a net loss attributable to common shareholders $45.9 million for the twelve months of 2016. On average, 14.2 vessels were owned and operated during 2017 earning an average time charter equivalent rate of $8,290 per day compared to 11.52 vessels in the same period of 2016 earning on average $7,259 per day.\nThe results for the twelve months of 2017 include a $0.1 million net gain on derivatives, a $0.8 million net gain on sale of two vessels and a $4.6 million loss on write-down of two vessels held for sale, as compared to a $0.1 million net loss on derivatives, a $5.9 million loss on write-down of vessel held for sale, a $7.1 million loss on termination of shipbuilding contracts and a $18.5 million impairment loss in other investment and investment in joint venture for the same period of 2016.\nDepreciation expenses for 2017 were $8.4 million compared to $8.8 million during the same period of 2016. Although the average number of vessels increased in the twelve months of 2017 compared to the same period of 2016, the new vessels acquired have a lower average daily depreciation charge as a result of their lower initial values (acquisition price) and greater remaining useful life (i.e. m/v Alexandros P) compared to the remaining vessels. During 2017, there was no equity loss in joint venture and other investment income, as compared to equity loss of $2.4 million and other investment income of $1.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, since the equity investment in Euromar and the invested portion of its investment in preferred units of Euromar was entirely impaired in 2016, as mentioned above.\nAdjusted EBITDA for 2017 was $9.3 million increasing from the ($1.3) million recorded during 2016. Please see below for Adjusted EBITDA reconciliation to net loss and cash flow provided by operating activities.\nBasic and diluted loss per share attributable to common shareholders for 2017 was $0.71 calculated on 11,067,524 basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding, compared to basic and diluted loss per share of $5.63 for 2016, calculated on 8,165,703 basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding.\nExcluding the effect on the loss attributable to common shareholders of the net gain/loss on derivatives, the net gain on sale of vessels and loss on write-down of vessels held for sale, the loss on termination of shipbuilding contracts and the impairment loss of other investment and investment in joint venture, the adjusted net loss per share attributable to common shareholders for 2017 would have been $0.38 compared to a loss of $1.76 per share basic and diluted for 2016. Usually, security analysts do not include the above items in their published estimates of earnings per share.\nFleet Profile:\nThe Euroseas Ltd. fleet profile as of February 26, 2018 is as follows:\nName Type Dwt TEU Year Built Employment(*) TCE Rate ($/day) Dry Bulk Vessels XENIA Kamsarmax 82,000 2016 TC 'till Jan-2020\n+ 1 year in Charterers Option $14,100\n$14,350 EIRINI P Panamax 76,466 2004 TC 'till Mar-18 Hire 104%\nof Average\nBPI(***) 4TC TASOS Panamax 75,100 2000 TC 'till Mar-18 $8,500 PANTELIS Panamax 74,020 2000 TC 'till Mar-18 $ 9,650 ALEXANDROS P.

We define calendar days as the total number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet was in our possession including off-hire days associated with major repairs, drydockings or special or intermediate surveys or days of vessels in lay-up. Calendar days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we record during that period.\n(3) The scheduled off-hire days including vessels laid-up are days associated with scheduled repairs, drydockings or special or intermediate surveys or days of vessels in lay-up.\n(4) Available days. We define available days as the total number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet was in our possession net of scheduled off-hire days. We use available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels were available to generate revenues.\n(5) Commercial off-hire days. We define commercial off-hire days as days a vessel is idle without employment (this definition has been revised starting from April 1, 2017 to exclude from commercial offhire days, days the vessel is sailing for repositioning purposes; previous periods' commercial offihire has been adjusted accordingly if necessary).\n(6) Operational off-hire days. We define operational off-hire days as days associated with unscheduled repairs or other off-hire time related to the operation of the vessels.\n(7) Voyage days. We define voyage days as the total number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet was in our possession net of commercial and operational off-hire days. We use voyage days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues or are sailing for repositioning purposes.\n(8) Fleet utilization. We calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of our voyage days during a period by the number of our available days during that period. We use fleet utilization to measure a company's efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels and minimizing the amount of days that its vessels are off-hire for reasons such as unscheduled repairs or days waiting to find employment.\n(9) Fleet utilization, commercial. We calculate commercial fleet utilization by dividing our available days net of commercial off-hire days during a period by our available days during that period.\n(10) Fleet utilization, operational. We calculate operational fleet utilization by dividing our available days net of operational off-hire days during a period by our available days during that period.\n(11) Time charter equivalent, or TCE, is a measure of the average daily revenue performance of a vessel on a per voyage basis. Our method of calculating TCE is determined by dividing revenue generated from charters net of voyage expenses by voyage days for the relevant time period. Voyage expenses primarily consist of port, canal and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage, which would otherwise be paid by the charterer under a time charter contract. TCE is a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a shipping company's performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., spot voyage charters, time charters and bareboat charters) under which the vessels may be employed between the periods. Our definition of TCE may not be comparable to that used by other companies in the shipping industry\n(12) Daily vessel operating expenses, which includes crew costs, provisions, deck and engine stores, lubricating oil, insurance, maintenance and repairs and management fees are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by fleet calendar days for the relevant time period. Drydocking expenses are reported separately.\n(13) Daily general and administrative expense is calculated by dividing general and administrative expense by fleet calendar days for the relevant time period.\n(14) Total vessel operating expenses, or TVOE, is a measure of our total expenses associated with operating our vessels. TVOE is the sum of vessel operating expenses excluding drydocking expenses and general and administrative expenses. Daily TVOE is calculated by dividing TVOE by fleet calendar days for the relevant time period.\n(15) Drydocking expenses, which include expenses during drydockings that would have been capitalized and amortized under the deferral method divided by the fleet calendar days for the relevant period. Drydocking expenses could vary substantially from period to period depending on how many vessels underwent drydocking during the period.\nConference Call and Webcast:\nLater today, Monday, March 5, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. EST, the company's management will host a conference call to discuss the results.\nConference Call details:\nParticipants should dial into the call 10 minutes before the scheduled time using the following numbers: 1 (866) 819-7111 (from the US), 0(800) 953-0329 (from the UK) or (+44) (0) 1452 542 301 (from outside the US).

Euroseas also computes Adjusted EBITDA by adding the net cash flow provided by / (used in) operating activities, the changes in operating assets / liabilities of the period, the other operating income, the realized loss or (gain) on derivatives, the equity loss in joint venture and other investment income, the share based compensation of the period and the net interest of the period. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or cash flow from operations, as determined by United States generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is included herein because it is a basis upon which the Company assesses its financial performance and liquidity position and because the Company believes that it presents useful information to investors regarding a company's ability to service and/or incur indebtedness. The Company's definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as that used by other companies in the shipping or other industries.\nEuroseas Ltd.
