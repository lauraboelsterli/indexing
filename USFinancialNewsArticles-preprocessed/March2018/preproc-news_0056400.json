These statements may be identified, without limitation, by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “anticipates”, “expects,” “will” or comparable terms or the negative thereof. Such statements are based on management’s current estimates, assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, and currently available competitive, financial, and economic data as of the date hereof. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and subject to a variety of events, factors and conditions, many of which are beyond the control of Propel Media and not all of which are known to Propel Media, including, without limitation those risk factors described from time to time in Propel Media’s reports filed with the SEC. Among the factors that could cause Propel Media’s actual results to differ materially are: loss of key advertising customers; inability to acquire new advertising customers; limitations on its ability to acquire new users profitably or at all; inability to protect its intellectual property; inability to comply with the covenants in its credit facility; inability to obtain necessary financing or enter into equity arrangements with existing or new institutional shareholders; inability to execute its acquisition strategy; inability to effectively manage its growth; failure to effectively integrate the operations of acquired businesses; competition; loss of key personnel; increases in costs of operations; continued compliance with government regulations; and general economic conditions. Further, investors should keep in mind that Propel Media’s financial results in any particular period may not be indicative of future results. Propel Media is under no obligation to, and expressly disclaims any obligation to, update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise, except as required by law.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, we present Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted EBITDA, which is based upon the adjusted EBITDA which we report to our lenders, is a key measurement monitored by management, and is determined by taking net (loss) income (the nearest GAAP measure) and adding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairment charges, stock based compensation, bank fees, losses from extraordinary, unusual or nonrecurring items, including board of director fees paid during the year ended December 31, 2017, noncash items, merger and other onetime expenses and severance. We believe that this non-GAAP measure, viewed in addition to and not in lieu of our reported GAAP results, provides useful information to investors by providing a more focused measure of operating results, enhances the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allows for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP measure presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA has been reconciled to the nearest GAAP measure in the table following the financial statements attached to this press release.\nPropel Media, Inc. and Subsidiaries Consolidated Balance Sheets As of December 31, Assets 2017 2016 Current assets Cash $ 5,081,000 $ 2,823,000 Accounts receivable, net 9,502,000 6,595,000 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 1,157,000 564,000 Total current assets 15,740,000 9,982,000 Property and equipment, net 3,315,000 1,594,000 Intangible assets 1,201,000 20,000 Goodwill 6,028,000 2,869,000 Deferred tax assets, net 18,932,000 31,691,000 Other assets 137,000 89,000 Total assets $ 45,353,000 $ 46,245,000 Liabilities and Stockholders’ Deficit Current liabilities Accounts payable $ 4,419,000 $ 1,861,000 Accrued expenses 4,252,000 3,914,000 Advertiser deposits 2,137,000 1,832,000 Current portion of long-term debt 6,181,000 6,089,000 Total current liabilities 16,989,000 13,696,000 Long-term debt, less current portion, net 60,725,000 65,999,000 Obligations to transferors, net 15,203,000 14,569,000 Other non-current liabilities - 142,000 Total liabilities 92,917,000 94,406,000 Stockholders' Deficit Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value, authorized 1,000,000 shares, - - no shares issued or outstanding Common Stock, $0.0001 par value, authorized 500,000,000 shares, issued and outstanding 250,010,162 at December 31, 2017 and 2016 25,000 25,000 Additional paid-in capital 3,717,000 2,757,000 Accumulated deficit (51,306,000 ) (50,943,000 ) Total stockholders’ deficit (47,564,000 ) (48,161,000 ) Total liabilities and stockholders' deficit $ 45,353,000 $ 46,245,000\nPropel Media, Inc. and Subsidiaries Consolidated Statements of Income For the Three Months Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenues $ 26,313,000 $ 16,637,000 $ 88,667,000 $ 61,226,000 Cost of revenues 10,226,000 5,280,000 32,800,000 21,710,000 Gross profit 16,087,000 11,357,000 55,867,000 39,516,000 Operating expenses: Salaries, commissions, benefits and related expenses 4,675,000 3,622,000 14,986,000 14,123,000 Technology, development and maintenance 1,366,000 402,000 4,021,000 3,488,000 Sales and marketing 82,000 49,000 143,000 118,000 General and administrative 2,716,000 408,000 4,103,000 1,641,000 Professional services 163,000 158,000 1,042,000 1,154,000 Depreciation and amortization 450,000 419,000 1,660,000 2,142,000 Impairment of software and intangible assets - - 20,000 183,000 Operating expenses 9,452,000 5,058,000 25,975,000 22,849,000 Operating income 6,635,000 6,299,000 29,892,000 16,667,000 Other income (expense): Interest expense, net (2,881,000 ) (3,027,000 ) (12,216,000 ) (12,311,000 ) Gain from extinguishment of debt - - - 106,000 Other income 106,000 (2,000 ) 106,000 16,000 Total other expense (2,775,000 ) (3,029,000 ) (12,110,000 ) (12,189,000 ) Income before income tax expense 3,860,000 3,270,000 17,782,000 4,478,000 Income tax expense (12,984,000 ) (2,010,000 ) (18,145,000 ) (3,897,000 ) Net (loss) income $ (9,124,000 ) $ 1,260,000 $ (363,000 ) $ 581,000 Net (loss) income per common share, basic and diluted $ (0.04 ) $ 0.01 $ (0.00 ) $ 0.00 Weighted average number of common shares outstanding, basic and diluted 250,010,162 250,010,162 250,010,162 250,010,162\nPropel Media, Inc. and Subsidiaries Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA For the Three Months Ended December 31, For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net Income (GAAP) $ (9,124,000 ) $ 1,260,000 $ (363,000 ) $ 581,000 Add (subtract) the following items: Depreciation and amortization 450,000 419,000 1,660,000 2,142,000 Impairment charges - - 20,000 183,000 Interest expense 2,881,000 3,027,000 12,216,000 12,311,000 Stock-based compensation 243,000 229,000 960,000 1,640,000 Tax expense (benefit) 12,985,000 2,010,000 18,151,000 3,906,000 Bank fees 27,000 27,000 108,000 24,000 Amortization of DeepIntent deferred purchase price 287,000 - 551,000 - Merger and other one-time expenses (54,000 ) (3,000 ) 267,000 224,000 Board of Directors fees 900,000 - 900,000 - Severance 10,000 8,000 10,000 921,000 Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) $ 8,605,000 $ 6,977,000 $ 34,480,000 $ 21,932,000\nPress Contact:\nDavid Shapiro\nPropel Media\npress@propelmedia.com\nSource:Propel Media",
