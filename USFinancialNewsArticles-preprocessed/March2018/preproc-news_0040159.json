Sixteen exchanges have done so, March 7, the Japanese Financial Services Agency said.\nBinance CEO Changpeng Zhao confirmed receipt of the warning, tweeting: \"Our lawyers called JFSA immediately, and will find a solution.\"\nTweet\nIt was not clear whether Binance was still operating in Japan, and Zhao did not respond to a CNBC request for comment. Zhao said in a Bloomberg report that the company tried to get a license in Japan but has decided to remove its staff from its office.\nBitcoin one-week performance\nSource: CoinDesk\nReuters reported Thursday, citing a source familiar with the matter, that if Binance does not heed the warning, the agency will file a criminal complaint. The agency would not confirm that part of the report in an email to CNBC.\nJapan has become one of the largest markets in the world for cryptocurrencies. Trading in bitcoin-Japanese yen accounted for about 57.6 percent of total bitcoin trading volume, according to CryptoCompare.\nWATCH: Japanese authorities issue punishments to several cryptocurrency exchanges show chapters Japanese authorities issue punishments to several cryptocurrency exchanges 12:35 PM ET Thu, 8 March 2018 | 00:46",
