    "text": "REDWOOD CITY, Calif., March 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Menlo Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:MNLO), a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of serlopitant, for the treatment of pruritus associated with various underlying dermatologic conditions and for refractory chronic cough, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 and provided an update on its clinical development programs.\n“We are extremely pleased with the completion of our initial public offering. The funds from the IPO will provide Menlo the ability to advance the development of serlopitant as a potential once-daily therapy for pruritus and cough. We look forward to seeing the results from our Phase 2 study (ATOMIK) in atopic dermatitis which are expected in April of 2018,” stated Steve Basta, Chief Executive Officer of Menlo Therapeutics.\nFourth Quarter Business Highlights and Recent Developments\nIn January, we successfully completed our initial public offering (IPO) of common stock of 8,050,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $17.00 per share, which includes the exercise in full by the underwriters of their overallotment option. We raised net proceeds of approximately $125.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.\nIn November 2017, we initiated enrollment in a 200-patient Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus associated with psoriasis.\nIn October 2017, we initiated enrollment in a 170-patient Phase 2 trial evaluating serlopitant as a treatment for refractory chronic cough.\nDuring 2017, we expanded our management team with key hires in finance, clinical development, medical affairs and commercial development.\nClinical Program Updates\nAtopic Dermatitis\nWe have completed the treatment and follow-up period for all patients in our Phase 2 study of serlopitant as a treatment for pruritus associated with atopic dermatitis, and expect to report data from this study in April 2018.\nPsoriasis\nWe expect to report data from our ongoing Phase 2 study in pruritus associated with psoriasis in late 2018 or early 2019 as previously indicated.\nPrurigo Nodularis\nWe plan to initiate two Phase 3 studies in pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis in the second quarter of 2018. We expect to enroll approximately 200 patients in each study. One study will be conducted in the U.S. and one in Europe.\nWe have recently started a 52-week, multicenter, open-label safety study of serlopitant for the treatment of pruritus. The objective of this study is to provide long-term safety data for serlopitant in adults with pruritus associated with prurigo nodularis, atopic dermatitis, or psoriasis.\nRefractory Chronic Cough\nWe are updating timing for data from our Phase 2 study in refractory chronic cough. We now expect to report data from this study in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus our prior guidance of late 2018 or early 2019.\nFinancial Results\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nMenlo reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $9.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a net loss of $4.8 million for the same period in 2016.\nCollaboration and license revenue was $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $0.5 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to $2.0 million in milestone revenue recognized under the Company’s August 2016 License and Collaboration Agreement with Japan Tobacco Inc./Torii Pharmaceutical (JT Torii).\nResearch and development expenses were $10.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $4.1 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in clinical trial expenses related to the development of serlopitant and higher personnel-related expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $1.3 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel-related expenses to support our expanding operations.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nMenlo reported a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $29.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCollaboration and license revenue was $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $0.7 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a full year’s amortization of revenue from the initial upfront payment under the collaboration agreement with JT Torii and $2.0 million in milestone revenue from JT Torii.\nResearch and development expenses were $29.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $11.3 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in clinical trial expenses related to the development of serlopitant and higher personnel-related expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $3.8 million for the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to increases in personnel-related expenses to support our expanding operations.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Menlo had $62.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments, compared to $41.3 million as of December 31, 2016. In January 2018 the company completed the initial public offering of its common stock resulting in net proceeds of approximately $125.5 million. Shares outstanding immediately after the initial public offering were approximately 23.0 million, which includes common stock issued during the initial public offering and the conversion of convertible preferred stock into shares of common stock at the time of the initial public offering.\nFinancial Outlook\nFor the full year 2018, Menlo expects operating expenses in the range of approximately $77.0 to $87.0 million, including stock-based compensation of approximately $3.0 to $6.0 million. The 2018 operating expenses will be primarily driven by ongoing development activities related to serlopitant and increases in the company's general and administrative infrastructure.\nAbout Menlo Therapeutics\nMenlo Therapeutics Inc. is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of serlopitant, a once-daily oral NK-1 receptor antagonist, for the treatment of pruritus associated with various underlying dermatologic conditions and for refractory chronic cough.
