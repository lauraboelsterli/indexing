    "text": "BEIJING, March 9 (Reuters) - China’s outstanding total social financing was 178.73 trillion yuan ($28.20 trillion) at the end of February, up 11.2 percent from a year earlier, the central bank said on Friday.\nTSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.\nIt is also an indicator of activity in China’s vast shadow banking sector, which authorities are trying to rein in as part of a broader campaign to contain and reduce systemic financial risks.
