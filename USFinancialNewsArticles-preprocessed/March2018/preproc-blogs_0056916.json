    "text": "If you thought flu season was finally over, think again. \nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warns that while the number of reported flu cases is declining, flu season is still going strong. \nThe agency says there have been four more recent flu-related deaths, bringing the total number of flu-related deaths to 137 this season, CNN reports . Twelve states and Puerto Rico are still seeing widespread flu cases. \nFour states experienced high activity (Alaska, South Carolina, Virginia, and Wyoming). Meanwhile, eight states experienced moderate activity (Arizona, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and South Dakota), according to the agency's weekly report . \nMore than 27,438 people were hospitalized for the flu this year, according to the CDC, and the agency says there were 3,943 new confirmed infections last week. \nIf you want to avoid the disease, there's only one place to go where there's currently no flu activity: the U.S. Virgin Islands.
