    "text": "The euro edged up from the day's lows but remained weaker on Monday as an inconclusive election in Italy pointed to prolonged political uncertainty after right-wing and eurosceptic parties did better than expected .\nItaly's election verdict and the subsequent brief sell-off in currency and bond markets showed that political risks in the eurozone were back on investors' radars, though recent strength in its economy has made investors more tolerant of uncertainty than last year.\n\"Investors still believe that politics appear less likely to upset the apple cart than only a year ago and Eurozone growth could be hitting three percent this year,\" said John Taylor, fixed income portfolio manager at Alliance Bernstein in London.\nHe noted that in the run up to the vote, Italian spreads widened much less compared to French bonds last year, despite the ECB winding down its bond purchase plan.\nThe euro rose to a two-week high above $1.2360 in Asian trading after Germany's Social Democrats voted to re-enter a grand coalition with Chancellor Merkel's conservatives, signalling an end to a period of political uncertainty in Europe's biggest economy.\nBut it quickly retreated by 0.8 percent towards the day's low at $1.2269 as results from Italy pointed to a messier than expected outcome - a strong showing for anti-establishment parties and no groupings able to form a stable government.\nThe euro then rebounded on the day to trade 0.09 percent higher against the dollar.\nIt gained as much as 0.22 percent to 130.62 yen , its lowest since late August in early London trading.\nDespite the bounce, the euro was within striking distance of a seven-week low of $1.21545 touched on Thursday.\nEconomic momentum More worryingly from the euro's perspective, recent data showed that economic momentum has stalled in the euro zone, indicating the single currency may be coming under some pressure. A Citi economic surprise index for the currency bloc is at near six-month lows.\n\"There is some lingering caution around the outcome of the Italian election results and only the German vote prevented a bigger drop in euro/dollar,\" said Viraj Patel, an FX strategist at ING in London.\nshow chapters",
