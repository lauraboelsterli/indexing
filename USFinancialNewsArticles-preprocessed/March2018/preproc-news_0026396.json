FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump responds to a reporter's question about North Korea as he departs the White House, Washington, DC, U.S., for a day trip to suburban Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, for a Make America Great Again rally supporting Republican candidate Rick Saccone, March 10, 2018. REUTERS/Mike Theiler/File Photo Trump will headline a fundraiser in Beverly Hills as part of what will be his first trip to California since he assumed the presidency in January 2017. Trump won the presidency in November 2016 despite losing the heavily Democratic state of California badly to Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump is to first fly to San Diego for a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border to take a look at prototypes of the border wall he wants built. A party official said the $5 million will come from 90 people expected to attend the fundraiser. RNC Chair Ronna Romney McDaniel and finance chair Todd Ricketts will also attend.
