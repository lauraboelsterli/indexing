    "text": "1 COMMENTS Through much of the film “Final Portrait,” Geoffrey Rush as Alberto Giacometti is seen working on a portrait of his friend James Lord. But when the scenes focus on the brush strokes applied to the canvas, it is a real-life artist, Rohan Harris, doing the painting, as if he were a stunt double leaping into an action scene. It’s no exaggeration when the movie’s production designer refers to him as “Giacometti’s hand.”\n“Final Portrait,” opening on Friday, chronicles a few weeks in the Swiss artist’s life, attempting to replicate his work and creative process as accurately as possible. Another portrayal of an artist, the 10-part biographical television series “Genius: Picasso, ” which begins airing on National Geographic on April 24, takes on a similar challenge with a different approach: digitally inserting actual Picassos into its scenes. \nBoth of them grapple with issues that plague films about artists, from licensing rights to whether a recreated portrait should look like the original or the actor playing its subject. In “Final Portrait,” that would be Armie Hammer, who plays Lord.\nA clip from ‘Final Portrait,’ opening March 23 Movies about painters have a mixed record when it comes to how their work appears on-screen. “Mr. Turner,” the acclaimed 2014 J.M.W. Turner biopic directed by Mike Leigh, was made with the full cooperation of Tate Britain, known for its Turner collection. \nThe 1996 James Ivory film “Surviving Picasso,” one of his rare critical and commercial failures, didn’t receive approval to reproduce any of the late artist’s work. Instead, the movie used existing paintings by Vernon Witham that resembled Picassos. \n“I don’t think that had much to do with whether you enjoyed the film or not,” Mr. Ivory says. It’s the director’s responsibility “to make a film in which you don’t miss the works of art.”\n“Genius” and “Final Portrait” are more authentic, in part because the Picasso and Giacometti estates insisted on it. Written and directed by Stanley Tucci, “Final Portrait” is based on Lord’s memoir “A Giacometti Portrait,” which details sitting for the artist in Paris in 1964, right down to the eight or nine brushes he held in his left hand while painting with his right. \nThe Giacometti Foundation, which controls the artists’ rights, “were on us like a dog with a bone,” even after reading the screenplay and licensing images, says James Merifield, the film’s production designer. He was responsible for re-creating the artist’s cluttered studio and supervised the team that made works-in-progress to fill it. \nOscar winner Geoffrey Rush plays the artist Alberto Giacometti in ‘Final Portrait.’ Photo: Transmission Films “Large Head,” a plaster cast of a man’s head, “was scrutinized to the point of the nodules on the nostril,” he says, with an expert from the foundation advising “a little bit more plaster there, a little bit less plaster there.”\nThe filmmakers never set eyes on the actual “Portrait of James Lord,” which sold at a 2015 Christies auction for more than $20 million. Yet Mr. Harris painted about 15 versions at various stages to be used on camera, as the insecure Giacometti redid it repeatedly, painting over the canvas each time. For reference, Mr. Harris relied on photographs, other Giacometti paintings and footage of the artist, who died in 1966, at work.\nThe authentic painting, composed of scrawled black and white lines, isn’t especially realistic. But Mr. Harris was asked to make the ears a bit smaller for the film version. Compared with Mr. Hammer, “James Lord wasn’t nearly so handsome and chiseled,” Mr. Merifield says.\n“Genius,” which stars Antonio Banderas as Picasso, is full of reproductions. The Picasso Administration, which controls the artist’s rights, reviewed scripts for accuracy before licensing the works. \nAntonio Banderas stars as Pablo Picasso in ‘Genius: Picasso.’ Photo: Dusan Martincek/National Geographic The first episode, which begins with a middle-aged Picasso in 1937 and flashes back and forth in time, contains many of the Spanish artist’s best-known paintings, including “Guernica” and “Portrait of Dora Maar. ” Ken Biller, an executive producer, director and writer on “Genius,” says that in most cases green screens replaced the canvases while shooting.\nIn postproduction, he says, “we put the best quality digital image that we could onto that canvas.” In some scenes, digital prints were made of the actual paintings and placed on set.\nYears ago, preparing for a never-realized Picasso movie, Mr. Banderas studied with an artist. “It was not so much to become a painter but to be very familiar with all the tools,” he says. “There is not a lot of footage of Picasso. I tried to compose the way he walks, the way he related to others physically—which is very little. In a way I have to reinvent Picasso.”\nA clip from ‘Genius: Picasso,’ which begins airing on National Geographic on April 24 That approach suits “Genius,” which aims to capture the imagination of the artist, who died in 1973. Depicting the creation of “Guernica,” Picasso’s monumental antiwar painting inspired by bombing during the Spanish Civil War, “we don’t really see the painting evolving on the canvas, we see it evolving in his mind’s eye,” Mr. Biller says. The sequence is a montage, juxtaposing glimpses of Mr. Banderas holding a brush, small segments of the painting, bomb footage and film of a bull and a horse, images that made their way into “Guernica.” \nOne element “Genius” and “Final Portrait” share: The artists’ estates asked that all copies be destroyed after filming. \n“I suppose I should take it as a compliment,” Mr. Merifield says. “They feared our things were so good they could become black-market pieces.”",
