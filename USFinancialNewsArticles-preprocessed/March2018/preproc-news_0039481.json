A Tencent sign is seen during the fourth World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, China, December 4, 2017. REUTERS/Aly Song The stocks were set to open at HK$405, the lowest opening price since Feb. 9. That compared with a 3.67 percent fall in the benchmark index. Naspers plans to sell up to 190 million shares, or 2 percent, in Tencent and said it has no plans to reduce its holding further for the next three years.
