Joe carefully crafted and nurtured an entrepreneurial spirit that is well established, and his role in the development of the industry cannot be overstated. I am humbled to have the opportunity to build on this legacy and look forward to continued growth and excellence for PAREXEL.”\nMr. Macdonald led INC Research, now known as Syneos Health, for several years first as CEO and most recently as Vice Chairman. Under Mr. Macdonald’s leadership, INC Research delivered industry-leading growth and margins, experienced strong operational and market performance, and undertook a successful Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 2014. Prior to this time, he served as INC’s Chief Operating Officer. In addition, Mr. Macdonald has held several leadership positions in the biopharmaceutical services industry, including Senior Vice President and Head of Global Project Management at Quintiles, now known as IQVIA. He served as Chairman of the Association of Clinical Research Organizations (ACRO) Board of Directors in 2015.\nMr. von Rickenbach co-founded PAREXEL in 1982 and has since served as Chairman and CEO, building the company to a valuation of over five billion dollars with operations in more than 100 countries.\n“When we started PAREXEL more than 35 years ago, not only was it the beginning of a new company, it was also the dawn of a new industry,” said Mr. von Rickenbach. “Today, a new era begins. The biopharmaceutical services industry is more dynamic and exciting than ever, and Jamie is the right leader to take PAREXEL into the future. I am confident that our next generation will be an even greater one and I am delighted to have him join the Company. I look forward to working with Jamie to continue PAREXEL’s leadership in the marketplace.”\nA native of Scotland, Mr. Macdonald has held several global positions throughout his career.
