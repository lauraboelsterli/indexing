    "text": "0 COMMENTS What is Italian for “too many cooks in the kitchen?”\nBillionaire Paul Singer’s Elliott Management confirmed its latest target late Tuesday: Telecom Italia , TI.A 0.35% Italy’s version of AT&T. The shares closed up 6% following a Bloomberg report late Monday that the New York activist investor was building a stake.\nElliott is weighing into a political power struggle worthy of a Verdi opera. Telecom Italia’s board and management team were taken over last year by the company’s key shareholder, French media group Vivendi, which owns 23.9% of the ordinary shares. This sparked a political outcry in Italy.\nOne problem is that Vivendi, which is controlled by French billionaire Vincent Bolloré, also has a roughly 29% stake in Mediaset , the TV empire controlled by former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. Another is the importance in the digital economy of the old copper phone lines owned by Telecom Italia, which are being upgraded to deliver broadband. Last year, a government minister threatened to intervene in the company’s strategy.\nTelecom Italia’s board and management team were taken over by its key shareholder, French media group Vivendi. Photo: stefano rellandini/Reuters Chief Executive Amos Genish, Telecom Italia’s third boss in two years and a former board member of Vivendi, has tried to diffuse the latter controversy by creating a separate legal entity for the network. The company published details late Tuesday—just hours after Elliott confirmed its investment—alongside annual results and a plan to revive the group’s fortunes by using the company’s mobile customer base to cross sell more broadband and TV subscriptions. Meanwhile, Italian elections ushered in a new, uncertain political order last weekend.\nElliott said the company’s “governance, valuation, strategic direction and relationships with Italian authorities would be improved by replacing certain members of the board.” Under Telecom Italia’s bylaws the anchor shareholder—currently Vivendi—can usually appoint two-thirds of board members. Elliott may have its eyes on the one-third of seats allocated to minority shareholders.\nIf this sounds an unpredictable basis for an investment, there could be a simpler explanation: Telecom Italia shares look cheap even by the undemanding standards of Europe’s former telecom monopolies. Including debt, Telecom Italia’s market value is equivalent to roughly five times expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to FactSet.\nBut investors may be rash to assume an imminent improvement in valuation. With so many competing plans for Telecom Italia, from investors and politicians alike, stable management may be too much to hope for.\nWrite to Stephen Wilmot at stephen.wilmot@wsj.com",
