    "text": "March 31, 2018 / 5:43 AM / Updated 3 hours ago Fox's Ingraham taking vacation as advertisers flee amid controversy Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Fox News show host Laura Ingraham announced on her show late Friday that she is taking next week off, after almost a dozen advertisers dropped her show after the conservative pundit mocked a teenage survivor of the Florida school massacre on Twitter. \nEleven companies so far have pulled their ads after a pushback by Parkland student David Hogg, 17, who called for a boycott of her advertisers. \nA Fox News Channel spokeswoman said Ingraham was taking a pre-planned spring vacation with her children. \nHogg took aim at the host’s show, “The Ingraham Angle”, after she taunted him on Twitter on Wednesday, accusing him of whining about being rejected by four colleges to which he had applied. \nHogg is a survivor of the Feb. 14 mass shooting that killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in the Parkland suburb of Fort Lauderdale. He and other classmates have become the faces of a new youth-led movement calling for tighter restrictions on firearms. \nHogg tweeted a list of a dozen companies that advertise on “The Ingraham Angle” and urged his supporters to demand that they cancel their ads.

REUTERS/Mary F. Calvert, Jonathan Ernst/Files \nOn Thursday, Ingraham tweeted an apology “in the spirit of Holy Week,” saying she was sorry for any hurt or upset she had caused Hogg or any of the “brave victims” of Parkland. \nBut her apology did not stop companies from departing. \nThe companies announcing that they are cancelling their ads are: Nutrish, the pet food line created by celebrity chef Rachael Ray, travel website TripAdvisor Inc ( TRIP.O ), online home furnishings seller Wayfair Inc ( W.N ), the world’s largest packaged food company, Nestle SA ( NESN.S ), online streaming service Hulu, travel website Expedia Group Inc ( EXPE.O ) and online personal shopping service Stitch Fix ( SFIX.O ). \nAccording to CBS News, four other companies joined the list Friday: the home office supply store Office Depot, the dieting company Jenny Craig, the Atlantis, Paradise Island resort and Johnson & Johnson which produces pharmaceuticals as well as consumer products such as Band-Aids, Neutrogena beauty products and Tylenol. \nHogg wrote on Twitter that an apology just to mollify advertisers was insufficient. \nIngraham’s show runs on Fox News, part of Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc ( FOXA.O ).
