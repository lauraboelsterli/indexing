    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Jones Soda Co. (the “Company”) (OTCQB: JSDA), a leader in the craft soda category and known for its unique branding and innovative marketing, today announced the close of a $2.8 million dollar financing and the results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n$2,800,000 Convertible Note Financing\nOn March 23, 2018, Jones Soda Co. closed a private placement of $2.8 million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated promissory notes bearing interest at 6% per annum, with a four-year term and a fixed $0.32 conversion rate, to select institutional and individual accredited investors, including Jennifer Cue, the Company’s CEO. Max Schroedl, the Company’s CFO, added, “This financing represents the first outside capital raised by the Company since Jennifer began as the CEO. Now is the time to accelerate our initiatives and capitalize on the promise shown by our product portfolio.” The proceeds of the financing will be used to fund the Company’s Lemoncocco and Fountain initiatives and for other general working capital purposes.\n“My participation in this financing reflects my confidence in Jones and conviction to delivering shareholder value. This capital allows us to invest in our Lemoncocco and Fountain initiatives, which have the broad demographic appeal and higher margins to return value to our shareholders,” stated Cue.\nFull Year Review - Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue was approximately $13.3 million compared to $15.7 million for the prior year. Gross margin was 22.7% of revenue, compared to 26.2% last year primarily due to $275,000 of obsolete inventory write-downs reflecting our current assessment of market conditions. Net loss was $1,271,000 or ($0.03) per share, compared to a net loss of $183,000 or ($0.00) per share, last year.\nFor the year, the revenue decline was primarily attributable to the second quarter de-listing of our Jones 12-ounce cans by a major retailer, increased competition for craft shelf space and downward pressure on the CSD industry. Growth in our Lemoncocco and Fountain initiatives, which combined now represent 6.5% of our revenue, offset the declines. During 2017, Fountain revenue increased by 197% and Lemoncocco revenue increased by 37%.\nFourth Quarter Review - Comparison of Quarters Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue was approximately $2.2 million compared to $3.0 million for fourth quarter of 2016. Gross margin was 9.5% of revenue, compared to 24.6% last year due to write-offs during the fourth quarter of 2017. Net loss was $808,000 or ($0.02) per share, compared to a net loss of $236,000 or ($0.01) per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter, the revenue decline was primarily attributable to the quarter over quarter timing of our 7-Select pipeline fill (Q4’16), as well as the de-listing of our Jones 12-ounce cans by a major retailer.\nCompany Announces New Board Member\nOn March 23, 2018, in connection with the financing transaction, the Company appointed Christopher Beach to serve as a member of the Board of Directors. The authorized size of the Board increased by one, from six to seven.\nMr. Beach has 25 years of small company governance, investment and strategy experience, with a concentration in the consumer and business services sectors. Most recently, Mr. Beach served as a director of Kleinfeld Bridal, a luxury retailer, from 2012 to 2014. Mr. Beach also served as Director of Business Development for Dycom Industries, Inc., an engineering and construction company, where Mr. Beach was responsible for intellectual property commercialization and other new business opportunities.\nConference Call\nThe Company will discuss its results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 on its scheduled conference call today, March 27, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time (1:30 p.m. Pacific time). This call will be webcast and can be accessed by visiting the Investor section of the Company’s website at www.jonessoda.com .

In addition, a telephone replay will be available by dialing (412) 317-6671 (conference ID: 5951356) through April 3, 2018, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time.\nPresentation of Non-GAAP Information\nThis press release contains disclosure of the Company’s Adjusted EBITDA, which is a not a United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principle (“GAAP”) financial measure. The difference between Adjusted EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure) and Net Loss (the most comparable GAAP financial measure) is the exclusion of interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense and stock-based compensation. We have included a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Loss in our Non-GAAP Reconciliation in this press release. This non-GAAP measure should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in that it does not take into account the impact of certain expenses to our consolidated statements of operations. In addition, because Adjusted EBITDA may not be calculated identically by all companies, the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors about the Company’s results attributable to operations, in particular by eliminating the impact of non-cash charges related to stock-based compensation, amortization and depreciation that is consistent with the manner in which we evaluate the Company’s performance. These adjustments to the Company’s GAAP results are made with the intent of providing a more complete understanding of the Company’s underlying operational results and provide supplemental information regarding our current ability to generate cash flow. This non-GAAP financial measure and is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a replacement for, or superior to net loss as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance, or cash flow, as a measure of its liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA should be reviewed in conjunction with Net Loss as calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout Jones Soda Co.\nHeadquartered in Seattle, Washington, Jones Soda Co. ® (OTCQB: JSDA) markets and distributes premium beverages under the Jones ® Soda and Lemoncocco ® brands.
