This is a life long dream come true as I am a massive #formula1 fan. Thank you #F1!,” Tyler, who was a guest at last year’s U.S. Grand Prix, said on his Twitter feed.\nU.S.-based Liberty Media took over the global sport in January last year and has set about engaging a younger audience as well as developing a digital strategy.\nFormula One launched a television streaming product, F1 TV, last Tuesday.\n“Within the context of looking at ways to bring fans closer to Formula One, we are exploring all avenues to refresh the look and feel of the show,” said a Formula One spokesman.\n“Music is a key component of the emotion of sport and we are engaging with top international talent in order to develop a new signature tune for F1.\n“This is a process in development and we will make a formal announcement at the right time.”\nReporting by Alan Baldwin; Editing by Robin Pomeroy\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
