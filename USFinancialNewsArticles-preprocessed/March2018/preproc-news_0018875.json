    "text": "PHILADELPHIA, March 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Urban Outfitters, Inc. (NASDAQ:URBN), a leading lifestyle products and services company which operates a portfolio of global consumer brands comprised of Anthropologie, BHLDN, Free People, Terrain and Urban Outfitters brands and the Food and Beverage division, today announced net income of $1 million and $108 million for the three months and year ended January 31, 2018, respectively. Earnings per diluted share were $0.01 and $0.96 for the three months and year ended January 31, 2018, respectively. For the three months ended January 31, 2018, adjusted net income was $75 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.69. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included at the end of this release.\nTotal Company net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 5.7% over the same period last year to a record $1.09 billion. Comparable Retail segment net sales increased 4%, driven by strong, double-digit growth in the digital channel partially offset by negative retail store sales. By brand, comparable Retail segment net sales increased 8% at Free People, 5% at the Anthropologie Group and 2% at Urban Outfitters. Wholesale segment net sales increased 6.3%.\nFor the year ended January 31, 2018, total Company net sales increased to $3.6 billion or 2.0% over the prior year. Comparable Retail segment net sales were flat. Wholesale segment net sales increased 9.5%.\n“I am pleased to announce that URBN produced record Q4 sales primarily driven by positive ‘comps’ at all three brands,” said Richard A. Hayne, Chief Executive Officer. “We are particularly pleased with how well the brands transitioned in January. Positive customer reaction to the new spring fashion offerings at all our brands has been strong and makes us optimistic regarding the first half of the year,” finished Mr. Hayne.\nNet sales by brand and segment for the three and twelve-month periods were as follows:\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended January 31, January 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net sales by brand Urban Outfitters $ 433,924 $ 413,799 $ 1,396,420 $ 1,414,996 Anthropologie Group 447,184 423,985 1,472,769 1,445,395 Free People 201,659 186,346 721,966 662,726 Food and Beverage 6,352 6,028 24,859 22,677 Total Company $ 1,089,119 $ 1,030,158 $ 3,616,014 $ 3,545,794 Net sales by segment Retail Segment $ 1,010,188 $ 955,909 $ 3,299,714 $ 3,256,890 Wholesale Segment 78,931 74,249 316,300 288,904 Total Company $ 1,089,119 $ 1,030,158 $ 3,616,014 $ 3,545,794 ﻿For the three months ended January 31, 2018, the gross profit rate decreased by 176 basis points and the adjusted gross profit rate decreased 113 basis points versus the prior year’s comparable period. The decline in the adjusted gross profit rate was primarily driven by deleverage in delivery and logistics expenses and initial merchandise mark-ups. The deleverage in delivery and logistics expenses was primarily due to increased penetration of the digital channel, increased expedited shipments around holiday in order to hit guaranteed delivery dates, and penetration of international and furniture shipments. These decreases were partially offset by lower merchandise markdowns as a result of improved sales performance and well controlled inventory. For the year ended January 31, 2018, the gross profit rate decreased by 259 basis points versus the prior year’s comparable period. The decline in gross profit rate was driven by deleverage in delivery and logistics expenses, initial merchandise mark-ups and merchandise markdowns. The increase in delivery and logistics expenses was primarily due to the increased penetration of the digital channel and penetration of international and furniture shipments.\nAs of January 31, 2018, total inventory increased by $12.8 million, or 3.8%, on a year-over-year basis. The increase in inventory relates to a 3% increase in comparable Retail segment inventory at cost.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $9.1 million, or 3.8%, and $9.5 million, or 1.1%, during the three months and year ended January 31, 2018, respectively, compared to the prior year’s comparable periods. Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses, increased by $7.0 million, or 2.9%, during the three months ended January 31, 2018, and expressed as a percentage of net sales, leveraged 62 basis points when compared to the prior year comparable period. The leverage for the three months and year ended January 31, 2018, was primarily due to the net savings associated with our store reorganization project, partially offset by increased investments in digital marketing. The increase in expenses for both periods primarily related to increased investments in digital marketing.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was 98.6% compared to 34.9% in the prior year period. The effective tax rate for the year ended January 31, 2018, was 58.6% compared to 35.5% in the prior year comparable period. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months and year ended January 31, 2018, was primarily due to a one-time charge on our foreign earnings and profits as well as a write down of certain net deferred tax assets in relation to the comprehensive United States tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of approximately $64.7 million.\nNet income for the three months and year ended January 31, 2018, was $1 million and $108 million, respectively, and earnings per diluted share was $0.01 and $0.96, respectively. For the three months ended January 31, 2018, adjusted net income was $75 million and adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.69.\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2018, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired 8.1 million common shares for approximately $157 million. These repurchases completed the Board’s February 23, 2015, repurchase authorization, leaving 17.9 million common shares remaining under the Board’s August 22, 2017, authorization to repurchase 20 million common shares.\nDuring the year ended January 31, 2018, the Company opened a total of 18 new locations including: 8 Free People stores, 5 Urban Outfitters stores, 4 Anthropologie Group stores and 1 Food and Beverage restaurant; and closed 11 locations including: 3 Free People stores, 2 Urban Outfitters stores, 3 Anthropologie Group stores and 3 Food and Beverage restaurants.\nUrban Outfitters, Inc., offers lifestyle-oriented general merchandise and consumer products and services through a portfolio of global consumer brands comprised of 245 Urban Outfitters stores in the United States, Canada, and Europe and websites; 226 Anthropologie Group stores in the United States, Canada and Europe, catalogs and websites; 132 Free People stores in the United States and Canada, catalogs and websites and 10 Food and Beverage restaurants, as of January 31, 2018. Free People and Anthropologie Group wholesale sell their products through approximately 2,100 department and specialty stores worldwide, third-party websites and the Company’s own retail stores.\nA conference call will be held today to discuss fourth quarter results and will be webcast at 5:00 pm.

Examples of items that we consider non-core include impairment charges, gains or losses on the disposal of our stores or restaurant locations and the nonrecurring impact of the comprehensive United States tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In order to improve the transparency of our disclosures, provide a meaningful presentation of results from our core business operations and improve period-over-period comparability, we have included certain adjusted financial measures that exclude the impact of these non-core business items.\nWe believe these adjusted financial measures are important indicators of our recurring results of operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our underlying results of operations and provide a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying business. Management uses adjusted financial measures for planning, forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance.\nNon-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the Company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of the items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the Company’s actual and future financial condition and performance. These adjusted financial measures are not consistent with GAAP and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nURBAN OUTFITTERS, INC.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(amounts in thousands, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nReconciliation of Adjusted Gross Profit: Three Months Ended January 31, 2018 2017 $'s % of Net Sales $'s % of Net Sales Gross profit (GAAP) $ 340,638 31.3 % $ 340,314 33.0 % Adjustments: Impairment charges (a) 11,410 4,341 Adjusted gross profit (Non-GAAP) $ 352,048 32.3 % $ 344,655 33.5 % Reconciliation of Adjusted Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: Three Months Ended January 31, 2018 2017 $'s % of Net Sales $'s % of Net Sales Selling, general and administrative expenses (GAAP) $ 249,850 23.0 % $ 240,787 23.3 % Adjustments: Loss on disposal of restaurant (b) (2,061 ) — Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses (Non-GAAP) $ 247,789 22.7 % $ 240,787 23.3 % Reconciliation of Income from Operations: Three Months Ended January 31, 2018 2017 $'s % of Net Sales $'s % of Net Sales Income from operations (GAAP) $ 90,788 8.3 % $ 99,527 9.7 % Adjustments: Impairment charges (a) 11,410 4,341 Loss on disposal of restaurant (b) 2,061 — Adjusted income from operations (Non-GAAP) $ 104,259 9.6 % $ 103,868 10.2 % URBAN OUTFITTERS, INC.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(amounts in thousands, except per share data)\nReconciliation of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS: Three Months Ended January 31, 2018 2017 $'s % of Net Sales $'s % of Net Sales Net income (GAAP) $ 1,318 0.1 % $ 64,288 6.2 % Adjustments: Impairment charges (a) 11,410 4,341 Loss on disposal of restaurant (b) 2,061 — Provision for income taxes on adjustments (c) (4,450 ) (1,694 ) Impact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, net (d) 64,705 — Adjusted net income (Non-GAAP) $ 75,044 6.9 % $ 66,935 6.5 % Diluted earnings per share (GAAP) $ 0.01 $ 0.55 Adjustments, net of tax 0.68 0.02 Adjusted EPS (Non-GAAP) $ 0.69 $ 0.57 (a) Impairment charges relate to ten retail locations during the three months ended January 31, 2018, and three retail locations during the three months ended January 31, 2017.
