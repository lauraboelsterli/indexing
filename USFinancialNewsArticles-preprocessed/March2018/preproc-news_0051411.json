The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to help evaluate its operating results by facilitating an enhanced understanding of its operating performance and enabling more meaningful period-to-period comparisons. There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in the press release. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in Secureworks’ industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than the Company does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nA reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is provided below for each of the periods indicated. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures for each of the periods presented. In future fiscal periods, the Company may exclude such items and may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items. Accordingly, the exclusion of these items and other similar items in this non-GAAP presentation should not be interpreted as implying that these items are non-recurring, infrequent or unusual.\nThe Company excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP financial measures:\nImpact of purchase accounting. The impact of purchase accounting consists primarily of purchase accounting adjustments related to a change in the basis of deferred revenue for the going-private transaction of Dell Inc. (“Dell”), an indirect parent of the Company, that was completed on October 29, 2013. The Company believes it is useful to exclude such purchase accounting adjustments related to the foregoing transactions as this deferred revenue generally results from multi-year service contracts under which deferred revenue is established upon sale and revenue is recognized over the term of the contract. Pursuant to the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations, GAAP requires this deferred revenue to be recorded at its fair value, which is typically less than the book value. In presenting non-GAAP earnings, the Company adds back the reduction in revenue that results from this revaluation on the expectation that a significant majority of these service contracts will be renewed in the future and therefore the revaluation is not helpful in predicting its ongoing revenue trends. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to (1) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, and (2) compare past and future reports of Secureworks’ financial results, as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related service contracts are renewed in future periods.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets consists of amortization of customer relationships and acquired technology. In connection with Dell’s going-private transaction, all of the Company’s tangible and intangible assets and liabilities were accounted for and recognized at fair value on the transaction date. Accordingly, for periods after October 29, 2013, amortization of intangible assets consists of amortization associated with intangible assets recognized in connection with Dell’s going-private transaction.\nStock-based compensation. Non-cash stock-based compensation relates to awards under both the Dell Technologies and Secureworks equity plans. We exclude such expenses when assessing the effectiveness of our operating performance since they do not necessarily correlate with the underlying operating performance of the business.\nOther expenses. Other expenses include professional fees incurred by the Company in connection with the Company’s initial public offering and amounts expensed in the settlement of a legal matter. The Company excludes these expenses for the purpose of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures because it believes these items are outside the ordinary course of business and do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of its current operating performance or comparisons to its past operating performance.\nAggregate adjustment for income taxes. The aggregate adjustment for income taxes is the estimated combined income tax effect for the adjustments mentioned above. The tax effects are determined based on the tax jurisdictions where the above items were incurred.\nImpact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act relates to a provisional tax benefit of $27.0 million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as a result of U.S. tax reform that was enacted in December 2017.\nAs the excluded items can have a material impact on earnings, management compensates for this limitation by relying primarily on GAAP results and using non-GAAP financial measures supplementally. The non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered as indicators of performance in isolation from or as a substitute for revenue, gross margin, research and development expenses, sales and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, operating loss or net loss prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis.\n(Tables Follow)\nSECUREWORKS CORP.
