    "text": "ALLENTOWN, Pa., March 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- JetPay® Corporation (“JetPay” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:JTPY) announced financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Highlights\nRevenues increased 35.0%, or $19.7 million, to $76.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $56.3 million in 2016, and up 15.1%, or $2.6 million, to $19.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from $17.3 million for the same period in 2016.\nRevenues within Payment Services increased 44.5%, or $18.1 million, to $58.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $40.7 million in 2016, and 17.4%, or $2.2 million, to $14.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from $12.7 million for the same period in 2016.\nRevenues within HR & Payroll Services increased 10.7%, or $1.7 million, to $17.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $15.6 million in 2016, and 9.4%, or $426,000, to $5.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 from $4.6 million for the same period in 2016. This organic growth included accelerated growth in sales of our Workforce Today® human capital management solution.\nConsolidated gross profit increased 25.5% to $23.7 million, or 31.2% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2017, up from $18.9 million from the same period in 2016.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (“EBITDA”) were $3.3 million and $(4.2) million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. EBITDA, adjusted for non-recurring and non-cash items (“adjusted EBITDA” - see Non-GAAP Financial Measures definition and reconciliation of operating income (loss) to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA below), was $5.2 million, or 6.8% of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $3.8 million, or 6.7% of revenues, for the same period in 2016. The increase in adjusted EBITDA of 37.7% in 2017 as compared to 2016 was directly related to the positive results from previous investments made in selling, general and administrative personnel driving significant revenue growth.\nEBITDA for the fourth quarter 2017 was up 47.1% versus the fourth quarter 2016, with EBITDA of $1.2 million and $826,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $1.4 million, or 7.3% of revenues, as compared to $1.2 million, or 7.0% of revenues, for the same period in 2016.\nThe ratio of total debt to total capitalization, which consists of total debt of $16.1 million and common stock subject to possible redemptions, convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ equity totaling $61.8 million, was 20.6% at December 31, 2017, an improvement from 24.6% at December 31, 2016.\nNews Highlights\nSigned partnership agreements with 16 additional partners over the last several months, including Bolts Technologies, a software provider that specializes in deposit account onboarding solutions for financial institutions.\nLaunched the first clients for the State of Illinois e-Pay System, with additional launches planned for the second quarter of 2018.\nAccording to The Nilson Report published on March 19, 2018, JetPay was the 12th largest processor of card not present payment transactions in the US in 2017, and was the sixth fastest-growing company by volume processed among the 40 largest merchant acquirers in the US.\nAppointed Robert Frankfurt to the Company’s Board, effective October 30, 2017. Mr. Frankfurt, the founder of Myca partners, Inc., has over 30 years of experience in assisting senior management and providing board leadership for numerous companies, including NASDAQ companies in the technology and payment processing industry. He brings valuable expertise to JetPay in the areas of strategic direction, financing strategies, acquisitions, and overall industry knowledge.\nAppointed Robert Metzger to the Company’s Board, effective November 20, 2017. Mr. Metzger, with his extensive and valuable experience of over 25 years in investment banking and academics, including the experiences he gained from his leadership roles on various boards, including companies in the human resources and payment technology space, will be of value in assisting management and the board with strategic direction and increasing stockholder value.\n“I am proud of JetPay’s company-wide revenue growth in excess of 30% for the third consecutive year, along with revenue growth in excess of 40% in our Payments Services Segment during this period,” stated Diane (Vogt) Faro, CEO of JetPay Corporation. “Our Payments and HR & Payroll businesses both had record years. We expect to carry this momentum into 2018, as we continue to integrate with the State of Illinois with significant impact starting in the second quarter of 2018, increase revenues with our new cash discount product, JetX, and increase the number and quality of key strategic relationships in both our Payment Services and HR & Payroll Services Segments. Our growth reflects an increasing ability to leverage our fixed cost base, and we anticipate continued improvement in margins in future quarters,” Ms. Faro added.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2016\nRevenues were $19.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $17.3 million for the same period in 2016. Revenues for the Payment Services Segment increased $2.2 million, or 17.4%, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was attributable to net revenue growth in our Government and Utilities, e-Commerce, and ISO/ISV sectors, including an increase in revenues in our cash discount product, JetX. Revenues for HR and Payroll Services Segment increased by $426,000, or 9.4%, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. This increase was largely attributable to the increasing demand for our full-suite human capital management services.\nOperating (loss) income for the three months ended December 31, 2017, was $(404,000), compared to $115,000 for the same period in 2016. Operating (loss) income includes depreciation and amortization expense of $1.2 million and $1.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to an unfavorable change in the fair value of contingent consideration liability of $464,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with a favorable change of $337,000 for the same period in 2016. This $801,000 year-over-year change in fair value of contingent consideration liability was partially offset by an increase in gross profit of $302,000, while selling, general, and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $4.8 million in both the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nNet loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017, was $(709,000), or a net loss applicable to common stockholders of $(3.9) million after accretion of convertible preferred stock of $2.9 million, compared to a net loss of approximately $(355,000), or a net loss applicable to common stockholders of $(2.3) million after accretion of convertible preferred stock of $2.0 million for the same period in 2016.\nFiscal Year 2017 Compared to Fiscal Year 2016\nRevenues increased 35.0% to $76.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $56.3 million for the same period in 2016, representing an increase of $19.7 million. Revenues for the Payment Services Segment increased 44.5%, or $18.1 million, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. This increase included revenue growth from the acquisition of our Government and Utility payments operation, which contributed an incremental $11.3 million of revenues in 2017, and continued growth in our e-Commerce, and ISO/ISV sectors, including growth in our cash discount product, JetX. Revenues for the HR & Payroll Services Segment increased $1.7 million, or 10.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. This increase was largely attributable to the increasing demand for our full-suite, human capital management product, WorkForceToday®.\nOperating loss for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $(1.3) million, compared to $(8.1) million for the same period in 2016. Operating loss includes depreciation and amortization expense of $4.5 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in operating loss was partially related to the acquisition of JetPay Payment Services, FL, which contributed an incremental $1.4 million of operating income in 2017, as well as a $6.5 million reduction in professional fees for non-repetitive matters and legal settlement costs, all partially offset by an increase in the fair value of contingent consideration liability by $224,000 and an increase in non-cash loss on disposal of fixed assets of $110,000.\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $(3.1) million, or a net loss applicable to common stockholders of $(13.5) million after accretion of convertible preferred stock of $10.4 million, resulting in a loss per share applicable to common stockholders of $(0.85), compared to a net loss of $(8.2) million, or a net loss applicable to common stockholders of $(14.6) million after accretion of convertible preferred stock of $6.4 million, resulting in a loss per share applicable to common stockholders of $(0.89) for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in net loss was primarily related to the decrease in operating loss described above.\nConference Call\nJetPay will conduct a conference call on Wednesday, April 4, 2018 at 9:00 AM EST (6:00 AM PST) to discuss these results and conduct a question and answer session.

The Company reports its financial results in compliance with GAAP, but believes that also discussing non-GAAP measures provides investors with financial measures it uses in the management of its business. The Company defines EBITDA as operating income (loss), before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangibles, and non-cash changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liability. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, as defined above, plus certain non-recurring items, including certain legal and professional costs for non-repetitive matters, legal settlement costs, non-cash stock option costs, and non-cash losses on the disposal of fixed assets. These measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management uses EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA as indicators of the Company’s operating performance and ability to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures and other investments and, in the absence of refinancing options, to repay debt obligations. Management believes EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are helpful to investors in evaluating the Company’s operating performance because non-cash costs and other items that management believes are not indicative of its results of operations are excluded. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are supplemental non-GAAP measures, which have limitations as an analytical tool. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting, may differ from GAAP measures with the same names, and may differ from non-GAAP financial measures with the same or similar names that are used by other companies. For a description of our use of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA to operating income (loss), see the section of this press release titled “EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation.”\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\n(000’s omitted) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31, Years Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Operating (loss) income $ (404 ) $ 115 $ (1,329 ) $ (8,088 ) Change in fair value of contingent\nconsideration liability 464 (337 ) 121 (103 ) Amortization of intangibles 869 867 3,492 3,244 Depreciation 286 181 1,032 721 EBITDA $ 1,215 $ 826 $ 3,316 $ (4,226 ) Professional fees for non-repetitive matters 29 186 268 1,339 Legal settlement costs - 72 747 6,192 Non-cash stock based compensation 202 132 767 446 Non-cash loss on disposal of fixed asset - - 110 32 Adjusted EBITDA $ 1,446 $ 1,216 $ 5,208 $ 3,783 Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
