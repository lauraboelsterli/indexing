    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, March 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Syapse, a leading precision medicine company, announced today that Frank Williams, the co-founder and CEO of Evolent Health, has joined the company’s board of directors.\nWilliams, a healthcare industry veteran and former executive chairman and CEO of The Advisory Board Company, brings deep expertise in helping health systems evolve to a value-based care model, focused on improving clinical outcomes and financial results. He started Evolent Health in 2011 to change the way healthcare is delivered in the U.S. by enabling health systems to gain the operational scale, financial partnerships, and clinical capabilities they need to deliver better patient outcomes at lower cost.\n“To truly make precision medicine a reality for every patient, we must focus on giving oncologists the data they need to make targeted treatment decisions,” Williams said. “Syapse is on a mission to do just that, and I’m thrilled to bring my expertise working with large community health systems to the table to advance this effort. I look forward to working together to bring better cancer care to more patients.”\nWilliams will provide strategic advice to Syapse during a time of rapid growth for the company. Syapse raised $30 million in Series D financing in late 2017, expanded to Asia earlier this year, and recently announced new partnerships with Roche and Medidata to advance precision medicine for health systems.\n“Frank’s experience helping health systems evolve to a new model of care and his philosophy of serving as a trusted partner to them is perfectly aligned with Syapse’s mission,” said Ken Tarkoff, CEO of Syapse. “I am honored to welcome Frank to the Syapse board, and I know his insights and expertise will be crucial as we expand our partnerships across the industry and advance precision medicine for health systems.”\nAbout Syapse\nSyapse is on a mission to deliver the best care for every cancer patient through precision medicine.
