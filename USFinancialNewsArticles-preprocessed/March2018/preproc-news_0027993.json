    "text": "\nTreading carefully in a Trump stronghold, Lamb has campaigned beside national Democrats with moderate reputations, like former Vice President Joe Biden , a Pennsylvania native who grew up in Delaware. He doesn't mention Trump's name. \nBut Lamb still benefits from the backlash against the president's turbulent debut in office, especially among women in suburban areas. Even some working-class men who voted for Trump have decided that was a mistake. \nGiven the size of the president's 2016 majority, Saccone can afford to lose some of Trump's base. At a campaign rally with Trump over the weekend , he tried to rouse enough of them to win. \nThe president also offered Saccone a last-minute boost of administration policy. The tariffs on steel and aluminum Trump has announced are tailor-made for blue-collar neighborhoods outside Pittsburgh, though the once-fabled \"Steel City\" has diversified its economy around sectors such as technology and health care in the 21st century. \nBut there's no sign the Republican president's move has reversed Lamb's momentum. For one thing, Lamb has himself offered qualified support for the tariffs â€” just as he has for some other controversial Trump initiatives such as a military parade in Washington on Veterans Day. Getty Images President Donald J. Trump with Rick Saccone speaks to supporters at the Atlantic Aviation Hanger on March 10, 2018 in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. \nFor another, Saccone is poorly positioned to harvest votes from the Steelworkers Union, which applauds the tariffs. As a member of the Pennsylvania legislature, Saccone has supported \"right-to-work\" laws that union members loathe. He opposes increasing the minimum wage. \nThat makes Saccone a sharp contrast with Murphy, who used strong rapport with organized labor to extinguish Democratic hopes of defeating him. In 2014 and 2016, no Democrat even ran against him. \nMurphy ended up defeating himself. If Democrats can capitalize on his misfortune on Tuesday, they will mark the path for winning back Congress eight months from now. John Harwood CNBC Editor at Large Playing ",
