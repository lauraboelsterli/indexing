    "text": "ATLANTA, March 13, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Darryl Holloman, Ph.D., joins Spelman College as vice president for student affairs, effective April 2, 2018.\nAs vice president for student affairs, Dr. Holloman will be responsible for supporting a student life agenda that promotes the growth and development and academic success of each and every Spelman student. He will oversee program development, financial management and personnel administration for all student development functions including the Office of the Dean of Students, Housing and Residence Life, Counseling Services and Student Access Center, Student Health Services and Campus Wellness, Student Life and Engagement and Student Judicial processes.\n\"Dr. Holloman brings many talents to Spelman College. He is a dynamic student affairs administrator, a scholar and teacher and a proven administrative leader,\" said Spelman President Mary Schmidt Campbell, Ph.D. \"His extensive experience in higher education, student affairs and student life will be significant in moving forward the College's strategic plan with an approach to student affairs that weaves together student well-being, academic excellence and the promotion of a healthy campus community.\"\nDr. Holloman joins Spelman from Georgia State University, where he is associate vice president for student affairs and dean of students. Prior to Georgia State, he was assistant vice president for student life and an assistant professor at Columbus State University. During his four years at Rutgers University-Newark, he was assistant dean of student affairs for the College of Arts and Sciences and was later promoted to associate dean of students and director of the Paul Robeson Campus Center, a campus wide center devoted to student success. He has also served as a full-time faculty member at the University of Arkansas-Little Rock.\n\"I am deeply honored and humbled to join the Spelman College senior leadership team led by Dr. Mary Schmidt Campbell,\" said Dr. Holloman. \"During my visits to Spelman I was struck by three things: The clear sense of collegiality and mission found at Spelman, the depth of the rich history, tradition and pride you feel just touring the campus, and the intelligence and determination of Spelman students. I look forward to working with Dr. Campbell, the Board of Trustees, faculty, students, alumnae, staff and parents to further the mission of this esteemed institution.\"\nDr. Holloman noted this is a critical time for the nation's HBCUs, liberal arts colleges and universities, and women-serving institutions, in particular. \"I am excited to work at Spelman during this time as the College continues its proven track record of preparing transformational women leaders of African descent to assume roles within our globally, competitive society,\" he said.\nAn Atlanta native, Dr. Holloman earned three degrees from Georgia State: a doctorate in educational policy studies; a master's degree in human resource development; and a bachelor's degree in English, with a concentration in creative writing.\nHe has presented more than 80 research papers at conferences including the Association for the Study of Higher Education, the American Educational Research Association Division F and J, the Association of College Unions International, the National Academic Advising Association, College Student Educators International, the Coalition of Urban and Metropolitan Universities and Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education. Dr. Holloman's research agenda examines how cultural identities and cultural distinctions shape college experiences. He has authored several articles and book chapters.\nAbout Spelman College\nFounded in 1881, Spelman College is a leading liberal arts college widely recognized as the global leader in the education of women of African descent. Located in Atlanta, the College's picturesque campus is home to 2,100 students. Outstanding alumnae include Children's Defense Fund Founder Marian Wright Edelman; Starbucks Group President and COO Rosalind Brewer, Broadway producer Alia Jones, former Acting Surgeon General and Spelman's first alumna President Audrey Forbes Manley, Harvard professor Evelynn Hammonds, author Pearl Cleage and actress LaTanya Richardson Jackson.
