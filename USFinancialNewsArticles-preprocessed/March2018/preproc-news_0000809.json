    "text": "Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, and Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA Exceeded Full Year Guidance\nFull Year Margin Improved 130 Basis Points\nMILWAUKEE, March 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Jason Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:JASN) (NASDAQ:JASNW) (“Jason” or “the Company”) today reported results for both fourth quarter and full-year 2017.\nKey financial results for the fourth quarter 2017 versus the year ago period include:\nNet sales of $145.5 million decreased 8.3 percent and included a negative 5.6 percent impact from the divestiture and planned exit of non-core businesses in the margin expansion program and a positive 1.6 percent from foreign currency translation. Operating income of $1.4 million, or 1.0 percent of net sales, increased $68.9 million on improved operational results, lower restructuring costs and $63.3 million of pre-tax impairment charges in the acoustics and components segments in 2016. Net income of $2.4 million, or $0.05 diluted income per share, increased $72.3 million or $2.75 per share, significantly impacted by $63.3 million of pre-tax 2016 impairment charges in the acoustics and components segments and $3.8 million of net tax benefit from the enactment of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act. Free cash flow was $0.1 million, a decrease of $7.6 million, due to lower cash flows generated by operations and higher capital expenditures.\nOn an adjusted basis, fourth quarter 2017 results versus the year ago period include:\nAdjusted EBITDA of $12.5 million, or 8.6 percent of net sales, increased $1.9 million from 6.6 percent of net sales, driven by margin expansion from improved operational efficiencies. Adjusted net loss of $0.3 million, or $0.01 Adjusted loss per share, improved $0.13 per share.\nKey financial results for the full year 2017 versus the year ago period include:\nNet sales of $648.6 million decreased 8.1 percent and included a negative 3.3 percent impact from the divestiture and planned exit of non-core businesses in the margin expansion program and a positive 0.2 percent from foreign currency translation. Adjusted EBITDA of $67.8 million, or 10.4 percent of net sales, increased $3.6 million from 9.1 percent of net sales, driven by margin expansion from improved operational efficiencies. Free cash flow was $14.2 million, an increase of $2.5 million, due to higher cash flows generated by operations and lower capital expenditures and preferred dividends.\n“Both the Finishing and Seating businesses posted organic growth in the fourth quarter, with Finishing delivering double digit growth for the first time since our 2014 go-public transaction,” said Brian Kobylinski, chief executive officer of Jason. “More importantly, our execution of continuous improvement initiatives and self-help projects allowed the revenue growth to flow through to the bottom line, improving margins and reducing our net leverage to 5.5 times.”\nHighlights during the quarter include:\nTotal Cost Reduction and Margin Expansion program savings were $1.5 million in the fourth quarter with a total of $20 million since the inception of the program. Actions taken and announced to-date are expected to achieve $24 million in annual run-rate cost savings.\nAchieved organic growth of 10.2 percent in Finishing and 5.1 percent in Seating. Finishing organic growth was achieved through strength in industrial, general manufacturing and oil & gas markets, along with share gains resulting from enhanced commercial focus, with Seating growth driven by new platform launches.\nCompleted the relocation and consolidation of the Finishing facility in Virgina into the Indiana facility on schedule and in-line with expected restructuring costs.\nIn December, announced the closure of the Acoustics manufacturing facility in Richmond, IN. The operations will be consolidated into other existing facilities by the end of the second quarter of 2018. The closure will result in run-rate savings of $1.8 million beginning late in the second quarter. As a result of this action, Jason expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges to earnings of approximately $2.1 million in 2018.\nPaid down $2.4 million of foreign term loan debt.\nKey financial results within the segments for the fourth quarter 2017 versus the year ago period include:\nFinishing net sales of $50.0 million increased $5.7 million, or 12.8 percent, including a positive foreign currency translation impact of 5.1 percent and a negative 2.5 percent impact from the exit of a non-core market in Brazil. Organic sales increased 10.2 percent and were impacted by higher volumes in industrial end markets, partially offset by strategic decisions to exit low margin business and products. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.8 million, or 11.5 percent of net sales, an increase of $1.5 million from 9.7 percent of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased on improved pricing and continuous improvement initiatives.\nComponents net sales of $19.8 million decreased $1.5 million, or 6.9 percent, including a negative 3.4 percent impact from the exit of non-core product lines upon the closure of the Buffalo Grove, Illinois facility. Organic sales decreased 3.5 percent due to decreased volumes of smart utility meters, partially offset by higher rail volumes. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.3 million, or 11.4 percent of net sales, a decrease of $0.4 million from 12.4 percent of net sales, and was negatively impacted by lower volumes, unfavorable product mix and higher material costs, partially offset by savings resulting from the cost reduction program.\nSeating net sales of $33.9 million increased $1.8 million, or 5.6 percent, including a positive foreign currency translation impact of 0.5 percent. Organic sales increased 5.1 percent on improved pricing and higher volumes in the construction and motorcycle markets, partially offset by lower volumes in the turf care market. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.3 million, or 6.8 percent of net sales, an increase of $0.9 million from 4.3 percent of net sales, and was positively impacted by pricing, continuous improvement initiatives and supply chain negotiation savings.\nAcoustics net sales of $41.8 million decreased $19.2 million, or 31.5 percent, including a negative 11.2 percent impact from the divestiture of the Company’s Acoustics European operations. Organic sales decreased 20.3 percent due to automotive assembly plant shutdowns on declining light vehicle demand and 2016 non-recurring volumes related to a competitor bankruptcy. Adjusted EBITDA was $6.0 million, or 14.3 percent of net sales, a decrease of $0.4 million from 10.5 percent of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA margin increased due to improved labor and material productivity and divestiture of low margin Acoustics European operations, partially offset by lower volumes.\nCorporate expenses of $3.9 million decreased $0.3 million on lower professional and consulting expenses and health care costs.\nOther Information:\nNet debt to Adjusted EBITDA on a trailing twelve-month basis was 5.5x as of the end of the fourth quarter, a decrease from 6.2x as of the end of 2016. Total liquidity as of the end of the fourth quarter was $95.4 million, comprised of $48.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $46.6 million of availability on revolving loan facilities globally.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017 the income tax benefit of $8.9 million included provisional charges related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The provisional charges included $5.3 million of tax expense for the deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, $11.1 million of tax benefit for the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities, and $2.1 million of tax expense for other discrete items related to tax positions impacted by the Tax Act. The Company is still assessing the impact of the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions of the Tax Act.\nSubsequent to the end of the fourth quarter the Company completed a transaction in which the Company exchanged 1,395,640 shares of common stock for 12,136 shares of 8.0% Series A Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock. The shares of Preferred Stock exchanged had an aggregate liquidation preference of $12.1 million, representing 24.4% of the Company’s outstanding Preferred Stock. With the completion of the exchange transaction, the Company has 27,362,021 common shares issued and outstanding, and 37,529 shares of Preferred Stock outstanding.\n2018 Guidance:\n“We successfully completed the first year of our turnaround plan. Our focus on operational execution coupled with targeted growth initiatives generated cash and drove leverage improvement. While challenges remain, our business is in a better position than a year ago,” added Kobylinski. \"We enter 2018 with a continued focus on cash flow and debt leverage reduction. Opportunity remains to improve our operations to better serve our customers, grow EBITDA and generate cash despite expected lower sales due to select end-market conditions. Delivering 2018 guidance will require execution of internally generated initiatives, not a market-driven correction.”\nFor 2018, Jason expects net sales in the range of $600 to $615 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $66 to $70 million and free cash flow of $13 to $17 million, which result in an implied net debt to Adjusted EBITDA range of 5.3 to 4.9 times.\nConference Call:\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter results today at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time.

Such forward-looking statements include projected financial information. Such forward-looking statements with respect to revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects and other aspects of the Company’s businesses are based on current expectations that are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements.

As you review and consider this press release, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results. They involve risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) and assumptions. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, you should be aware that many factors could affect our actual results and cause them to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements.\nAny forward-looking statement made by us in this press release speaks only as of the date on which we make it. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nNon-GAAP and Other Company Information\nIncluded in this press release are certain non-GAAP financial measures designed to complement the financial information presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America because management believes such measures are useful to investors. Because the Company’s calculations of these measures may differ from similar measures used by other companies, you should be careful when comparing the Company’s non-GAAP financial measures to those of other companies. In this earnings release, we disclose the following non-GAAP financial measures, and we reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures: EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings Per Share, Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin - The Company defines EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, excluding the impact of operational restructuring charges and non-cash or non-operational losses or gains, including goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment, divestitures and extinguishment of debt, integration and other operational restructuring charges, transactional legal fees, other professional fees, purchase accounting adjustments, and non-cash share based compensation expense. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales.\nManagement believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides a more clear picture of the Company’s operating results by eliminating expenses and income that are not reflective of the underlying business performance. The Company uses this metric to facilitate a comparison of operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period and to analyze the factors and trends affecting its segments. The Company’s internal plans, budgets and forecasts use Adjusted EBITDA as a key metric and the Company uses this measure to evaluate its operating performance and segment operating performance and to determine the level of incentive compensation paid to its employees.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share - The Company defines Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share (calculated on a diluted basis) as net income and earnings per share (as defined by GAAP), excluding the impact of operational restructuring charges and non-cash or non-operational losses or gains, including goodwill and long-lived asset impairment charges, gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment, divestitures and extinguishment of debt, integration and other operational restructuring charges, transactional legal fees, other professional fees, purchase accounting adjustments, and non-cash share based compensation expense, net of their income tax impact. The tax rates used to calculate adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are based on a transaction specific basis. Adjusted earnings per share includes the impact of share based compensation to the extent it is dilutive in each period. Adjusted earnings per share includes the impact to Jason Industries common shares upon conversion of JPHI Holdings Inc. rollover shares and conversion of preferred stock. Management believes that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share are useful in assessing the Company’s financial performance by eliminating expenses and income that are not reflective of the underlying business performance.\nNet Debt to Adjusted EBITDA - The Company defines Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA as current and long-term debt plus debt discounts less cash and cash equivalents, divided by pro forma Adjusted EBITDA for the trailing twelve months. Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA as reported plus or minus Adjusted EBITDA of acquisitions or divestitures prior to the date of the acquisition or divestiture, respectively, during the trailing twelve months. Management believes that Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA is useful in assessing the Company’s financial leverage.\nFree Cash Flow - The Company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash flows from operating activities (as defined by GAAP) less capital expenditures and cash dividends on preferred stock. Management believes that Free Cash Flow is useful in assessing our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for strategic capital decisions.\nIn addition to these non-GAAP financial measures, we also use the term “organic sales” to refer to GAAP net sales from existing operations excluding (i) sales from acquired businesses recorded prior to the first anniversary of the acquisition, (ii) sales from divested businesses or exited non-core businesses, and (iii) the impact of foreign currency translation. The impact of foreign currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in results (excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and exited non-core businesses) and (b) the period-to-period change in results (excluding acquisitions, divestitures, and exited non-core businesses) after applying current period average foreign exchange rates to the prior year period. We use the term “organic sales growth” to refer to the measure of comparing current period organic sales with the corresponding prior year period organic sales.\nJason Industries, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(In thousands, except per share amounts) (Unaudited) Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 Net sales $ 145,516 $ 158,750 $ 648,616 $ 705,519 Cost of goods sold 116,890 133,320 517,764 574,412 Gross profit 28,626 25,430 130,852 131,107 Selling and administrative expenses 25,787 27,282 103,855 113,797 Impairment charges — 63,285 — 63,285 Loss (gain) on disposals of property, plant and equipment -
