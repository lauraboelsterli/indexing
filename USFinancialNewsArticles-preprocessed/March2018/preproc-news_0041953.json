[NYSE:NWY], a specialty apparel chain with 432 retail stores, today announced results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 3, 2018.\nGregory Scott, New York & Company’s CEO stated: “We are pleased to report fourth quarter results that included increased comparable sales and better-than-expected operating income, capping off a strong finish to a year in which we made significant progress toward our long-term goals, particularly evolving to a lifestyle brand, becoming a digitally dominant retailer and delivering improved profitability. The fourth quarter was highlighted by a 3.0% increase in comparable sales, with positive traffic, expansion in gross margin and leverage in expenses. Combined, this led to GAAP operating profit of $5.0 million, representing growth of $14.2 million, as compared to the GAAP operating loss from the fourth quarter last year. The ongoing benefits from our prior Project Excellence initiatives, along with several new initiatives including the integration of our Outlet and core New York & Company businesses in the third quarter, added to our profitability. For the full year 2017 we were pleased to generate almost $30 million of EBITDA which is up more than $21 million to last year.\n“We are also pleased to begin fiscal 2018, with positive momentum as we continue to see improved traffic across all three channels of our business,” Mr. Scott continued. “Our New York and Company brand is performing well, as we continue to bring great style and value to consumers through our successful celebrity collaborations and our exclusive sub-brands, all through a seamless omni-channel experience. We also expect to benefit from another year of savings from Project Excellence work as well as new benefits from a recent streamlining of our corporate support functions. The combined effect of the Outlet integration in the third quarter and the corporate office rationalization in early February will reduce annualized payroll related costs by approximately $7 million. Finally, we look forward to integrating our newest brand, Fashion to Figure, into the New York & Company portfolio, and we believe this will allow us to capitalize on the plus-size market. I want to thank all of our associates for their contributions that led to our strong fiscal year in 2017 and remain optimistic about our business prospects as we begin fiscal 2018, which is reflected in our guidance.”\nFourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Results (14-weeks ended February 3, 2018 compared to the 13-weeks ended January 28, 2017):\nNet sales were $278.7 million, which included $7.1 million of royalty and related revenue from the private label credit card agreement, as compared to $266.3 million in the prior year, which included $5.4 million of royalty and related revenue from the private label credit card agreement. The Company noted that fiscal year 2017 included 53 weeks while fiscal year 2016 included 52 weeks, with the additional week occurring in the fourth quarter. Comparable store sales increased 3.0% largely driven by a double-digit percentage increase in the Company’s eCommerce business, combined with increased royalty and related revenue from the private label credit card agreement. All quarterly comparable store sales figures are based on a 13-week comparable time period. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 210 basis points to 29.5% versus the fiscal year 2016 fourth quarter gross profit percentage of 27.4%, reflecting the highest gross margin rate achieved in the fourth quarter since 2006. The increase during the quarter reflects a 160 basis point improvement in the leverage of buying and occupancy costs and a 50 basis point increase in merchandise margin.\nDuring the quarter, the Company continued to aggressively reduce expenses which led to a $1.8 million decrease in buying and occupancy costs, resulting primarily from rent reductions which contributed to the 160 basis point improvement in the leverage of these expenses, as compared to the prior year period.\nThe 50 basis point increase in merchandise margin was primarily driven by reduced product costs, combined with a $1.7 million increase in royalties under the private label credit card agreement, partially offset by a $2.7 million increase in shipping costs resulting from significant growth in the eCommerce business. On a GAAP basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were well below our guidance at $77.2 million, or 27.7% of net sales, as compared to $82.3 million, or 30.9% of net sales in the prior year period. The current year period includes expenses associated with the 53 rd week, as well as $0.3 million of various non-operating charges. The prior year period does not include expenses associated with the 53 rd week, but does include a $6.2 million legal reserve that the Company established relating to an ongoing trademark infringement case where the Company received an unfavorable judgment. On a non-GAAP basis, selling, general and administrative expenses were $77.0 million, or 27.6% of net sales inclusive of the extra week of sales and expenses, or 14-week period, as compared to non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses of $76.1 million, or 28.6% of net sales in the prior year, which represented a 13-week period. GAAP operating income improved significantly to income of $5.0 million, which included non-operating charges of $0.3 million. Excluding the $0.3 million of non-operating charges, adjusted non-GAAP operating income was $5.3 million, compared to the prior year’s non-GAAP operating loss of $3.0 million, which excluded $6.2 million of non-operating charges. Operating income on a GAAP basis exceeded the high-end of the Company’s increased guidance provided on January 8, 2018. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 was $4.7 million, or earnings of $0.07 per diluted share, as compared to the prior year’s GAAP net loss of $10.0 million, or a loss of $0.16 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, the Company’s fourth quarter 2017 adjusted net income was $5.0 million, or earnings of $0.08 per diluted share. This compares to prior year’s fourth quarter, non-GAAP adjusted net loss of $3.8 million, or a loss of $0.06 per diluted share.\nPlease refer to the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in Exhibit 5 of this press release, which delineates the non-operating charges for the three months ended February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017. GAAP is defined as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States.\nFull Fiscal Year 2017 Results (53-weeks ended February 3, 2018 compared to the 52-weeks ended January 28, 2017):\nNet sales were $926.9 million for fiscal year 2017, as compared to $929.1 million for fiscal year 2016. Comparable store sales increased 1.0%, as compared to a decrease of 0.7% in the prior fiscal year. All full fiscal year comparable store results are based on a 52-week comparable time period. GAAP operating income was $6.9 million. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted operating income was $7.7 million. This compares to a GAAP operating loss of $15.4 million and a non-GAAP, adjusted operating loss of $9.7 million for fiscal year 2016. EBITDA was $29.7 million for the full fiscal year. This compares to $8.6 million for fiscal year 2016 representing an improvement of $21.1 million. On an adjusted basis, excluding the impact of non-operating charges of $0.8 million in fiscal year 2017 and $5.7 million in fiscal year 2016, adjusted EBITDA was $30.5 million in fiscal year 2017, as compared to $14.4 million in fiscal year 2016. Net income was $5.7 million, or earnings of $0.09 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income was $6.4 million, or earnings of $0.10 per diluted share. This compares to the prior fiscal year net loss of $17.3 million, or a loss of $0.27 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, prior fiscal year adjusted net loss was $11.6 million, or a loss of $0.18 per diluted share.\nPlease refer to the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in Exhibit 6 of this press release, which delineates the non-operating charges for the twelve months ended February 3, 2018 and January 28, 2017.\nOther Financial and Operational Highlights\nTotal year-end inventory increased 8.3% and on-hand inventory was down slightly, as compared to the end of fiscal year 2016. The increase in total inventory reflects higher levels of inventory in-transit due to timing differences relating to the shift in calendar for the 53 rd week and the shift in the respective timing of Chinese New Year earlier in the first quarter. Capital spending for fiscal year 2017 was $12.5 million, as compared to $18.3 million in fiscal year 2016, primarily reflecting continued spending on the Company’s information technology infrastructure. The Company closed 21 New York & Company stores and 6 Outlet stores during the fourth quarter. For the full year the Company closed 38 New York and Company stores, 7 outlet stores, and opened 8 New York & Company stores and 3 Outlet stores, ending the full fiscal year with 432 stores, including 119 Outlet stores and 2.2 million selling square feet in operation. The Company ended the year with $90.9 million of cash on-hand and no outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility.\nFashion to Figure Intellectual Property and Certain Assets Acquired:\nOn February 2, 2018, the Company acquired certain assets of Fashion to Figure, a U.S. based retailer of trendy plus-size fashions, including intellectual property rights related to the Fashion to Figure® brand, for a total cash purchase price of $2.4 million including fees and expenses which was funded with cash on hand.\nThe assets were acquired by TFT Acquisition LLC, as the successful bidder at an auction run by Fashion to Figure, as part of its ongoing reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and were subsequently acquired by the Company. The asset purchase agreement covers all intellectual property, including trademarks, tradenames, an extensive customer database, and all in-store assets, with the exception of inventory. All lease obligations remained with the seller; however, the Company negotiated satisfactory new lease agreements to enable the Company to relaunch 8 key Fashion to Figure locations. The Company relaunched the Fashion to Figure business with 8 stores and through its eCommerce platform in early February. The Company hired certain former employees of Fashion to Figure, including members of the design, merchandising, eCommerce and the field management teams, who joined the Company during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nOutlook:\nRegarding expectations for fiscal year 2018, the Company continues to focus on improving its operating results to drive increases in both annual operating income and EBITDA. As the Company enters the Spring season, the combined effects of the calendar shifts from the 53 rd week in 2017 and new revenue recognition accounting standards will have an impact on the individual quarterly results, and as such, the Company will provide commentary on the overall Spring season, which combines the first and second quarters of fiscal year 2018, in addition to more detailed commentary on first quarter metrics.\nFor the Spring season, combined first and second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company expects non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $3 million to $5 million, excluding the impact of non-operating charges of $0.6 million primarily related to severance, resulting from the Company’s recently completed streamlining of its corporate office support functions, as compared to the prior year non-GAAP operating income of $1.2 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the Spring season, excluding the aforementioned charge for severance, is expected to be in the range of $15 million to $17 million, as compared to adjusted EBITDA of $12.8 million for the prior Spring season after excluding non-operating charges and benefits.\nFor the first quarter the Company expects non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $2 million to $3 million excluding the impact of non-operating charges of $0.6 million primarily related to severance, resulting from the Company’s recently completed streamlining of its corporate office support functions, as compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of $2.3 million in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter is expected to be in the range of $8 million to $9 million, excluding the impact of the aforementioned non-operating charges of $0.6 million, as compared to $3.8 million of adjusted EBITDA in the prior year period. The first quarter guidance reflects the following:\nNet sales are expected to increase in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range, reflecting the combined effect of the shift of the calendar due to the 53 rd week in 2017, and growth in eCommerce sales, partially offset by a reduced store count. As it relates to the calendar shift, an important pre-Mother’s Day week is moving out of the second quarter and into the first quarter benefiting sales and profits during the first quarter, but this shift will negatively impact the second quarter, as compared to last year. Comparable store sales, which are shifted to compare like calendar weeks, are expected to increase in the low single-digit percentage range. Gross margin on a GAAP basis is expected to be up 150 basis points to 200 basis points reflecting reductions in home office payroll costs driven by the ongoing benefits of Project Excellence and reductions in occupancy costs due to the Company’s aggressive real estate negotiations, partially offset by increased shipping costs associated with the growing omni-channel business. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales on a GAAP basis are expected to decrease by approximately 100 basis points versus the prior year’s first quarter. This reflects the Company’s continued efforts to increase efficiency and reduce home office payroll costs through a recently completed rationalization of the Company’s corporate support functions, partially offset by increases in selling expenses driven by increases in eCommerce variable costs and performance-based compensation accruals, which are anticipated this year based upon the Company’s improved operating results.\nAdditional Outlook:\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company expects to prepay the remaining outstanding balance on its Term Loan in the amount of $11.5 million, which matures in October 2019. The prepayment will save approximately $0.5 million of interest expense for the remainder of fiscal year 2018 and save $1 million of interest expense over the remaining term. The prepayment is expected to be funded with the Company’s existing cash balances. Total inventory at the end of the first quarter is expected to be up in the mid-single-digit percentage as compared to the prior year first quarter, reflecting timing differences due to the shift in calendar from the 53 rd week in 2017. Capital expenditures for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 are projected to be approximately $2 million to $4 million, as compared to $2.1 million of capital expenditures in the first quarter of last year, reflecting continued investments in the Company’s information technology and omni-channel infrastructure, and real estate remodel/refresh activity. For the full year, capital expenditures are expected to be below the prior year at $10 million to $12 million, including capital required for the Company’s new Fashion to Figure business. Depreciation expense for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 is estimated to be approximately $5 million and the full year is expected to be approximately $22 million. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company expects to open 8 Fashion to Figure stores, convert 1 existing New York & Company store to an Outlet store, remodel/refresh 5 existing stores, and close 8 stores, including 1 Outlet store. For fiscal year 2018, the Company expects to open approximately 5 New York & Company stores and 1 new Outlet store, open 8 Fashion to Figure stores, convert 1 existing New York & Company store to an Outlet store, remodel/refresh 11 existing stores, and close 35 stores to 45 stores, ending the fiscal year with roughly 401 stores to 411 stores, and approximately 2.0 million selling square feet.\nComparable Store Sales:\nA store is included in the comparable store sales calculation after it has completed 13 full fiscal months of operations from the store's opening date or once it has been reopened after remodeling if the gross square footage did not change by more than 20%. Sales from the Company's eCommerce store, including Fashion to Figure eCommerce sales, and private label credit card royalties and related revenue are included in comparable store sales. Fashion to Figure retail locations are not included in comparable store sales calculations until they complete 13 full fiscal months of operation. In addition, in a year with 53 weeks, sales in the last week of the year are not included in determining comparable store sales.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 results is scheduled for today, Thursday, March 22, 2018 at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time.

Exhibit (5)\nNew York & Company, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(Unaudited)\nA reconciliation of the Company’s GAAP to non-GAAP financial statement information for the 14-weeks ended February 3, 2018 and the 13-weeks ended January 28, 2017 is indicated below. This information reflects, on a non-GAAP basis, the Company’s adjusted operating results after excluding certain non-operating adjustments.
