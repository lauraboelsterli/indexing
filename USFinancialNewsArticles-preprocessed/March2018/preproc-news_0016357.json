    "text": "JOHANNESBURG, March 7 (Reuters) - South Africaâ€™s insurer MMI Holdings said on Wednesday half-year earnings fell 2.6 percent, due to weaker persistency in Metropolitan Retail and lower profitability of life products at Momentum Retail.\nMMI, which sells life and short term insurance, said diluted core headline earnings per share (HEPS) for the six months to end-December came in at 97 cents from 99.6 cents in 2016.\nHEPS is the main profit gauge in South Africa, which strips out certain one-off items.
