    "text": "NEW DELHI, March 8 (Reuters) - The Indian government on Thursday sought parliament’s approval to spend a net additional 853 billion rupees ($13.14 billion) in new spending in the current fiscal year to end-March 2018, a finance ministry statement said.\nThis extra spending is unlikely to impact the country’s fiscal deficit target for 2017/18 as India had raised the fiscal deficit target to 3.5 percent of gross domestic product from 3.2 percent earlier.\n$1 = 64.9200 Indian rupees Reporting by Nigam Prusty and Manoj Kumar; Editing by Malini Menon\n ",
