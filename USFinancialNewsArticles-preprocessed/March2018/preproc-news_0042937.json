    "text": "MONTREAL, Quebec, March 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Colt Resources Inc. (“ Colt ” or the “ Company ”) (TSXV:GTP) (FRA:P01) (OTC Pink:COLTF) announces that its wholly owned subsidiary, Q.S.P.A. - SOCIEDADE VITÍCOLA UNIPESSOAL, LDA., (“QSPA”), sold its winery in Portugal for gross proceeds of approximately €3.7 million net of transaction costs and subject to closing adjustments. Closing adjustments continue to be negotiated.\nOnce closing adjustments are finalized, QSPA anticipates receiving net proceeds of approximately €125,000 after repaying debts secured by the winery and posting legally required withholdings in Portugal. Additional amounts may be received by QSPA if certain accounts receivable, most of which are past due, are collected. Colt will work with counsel in Portugal to release the withholdings. Colt will provide additional updates in this regard when appropriate.\nThis is a significant milestone in the restructuring process of Colt that began in early 2017. A press release with highlights of the Company’s 2017 year will be issued shortly.\nAbout Colt Resources Inc.\nColt Resources Inc.
