ROLONTIS ™ (eflapegrastim): ADVANCE study recently met the primary efficacy endpoint; RECOVER study fully enrolled; BLA filing expected in Q4 2018. Q4 revenues were $28.6 million, including $27.9 million in product sales.\nHENDERSON, Nev.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NasdaqGS: SPPI), a biotechnology Company with fully integrated commercial and drug development operations with a primary focus in Hematology and Oncology, announced today financial results for the three-month period and year ended December 31, 2017.\n“2017 was a landmark year for Spectrum driven by advancements in our pipeline,” said Joe Turgeon, President and Chief Executive Officer of Spectrum Pharmaceuticals. “Poziotinib has the potential to be a life-altering therapy for cancer patients with exon-20 insertion mutations. ROLONTIS gives Spectrum a near-term opportunity to compete in a blockbuster market. We expect several pipeline milestones in 2018 and we look forward to keeping you updated.”\nPipeline Update:\nPoziotinib, an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor:\nThe Company has initiated a multi-center study which is currently enrolling Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients. This trial will enroll up to 87 patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations and up to 87 patients with HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations at several leading cancer centers. The study will evaluate objective response rate (ORR) as the primary endpoint, and disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR), and safety as secondary endpoints. An investigator sponsored trial is currently enrolling at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in NSCLC patients with exon 20 insertion mutations in EGFR or HER2. The study yielded preliminary results demonstrating evidence of significant antitumor activity in NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, with preliminary data in the first 11 patients showing an unconfirmed Objective Response Rate of 73%. Safety profile was consistent with those previously described for poziotinib and other TKIs. The Company expects additional data from this study in 2018. An abstract on poziotinib was accepted at AACR. Primarily pre-clinical data will be available at AACR on the anti-tumor activity of poziotinib in HER2 exon-20 insertion mutations in NSCLC. Spectrum is also conducting a Phase 2 breast cancer study in the third-line setting in the U.S.\nROLONTIS (eflapegrastim), a novel long-acting GCSF:\nA registrational Phase 3 study ADVANCE was initiated under an SPA with the FDA last year to evaluate ROLONTIS in the management of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The Company announced the ADVANCE study met the primary efficacy endpoint of non-inferiority in Duration of Severe Neutropenia between ROLONTIS and pegfilgrastim. The adverse event profile was similar between the two treatment arms. The Company has completely enrolled RECOVER, an international Phase 3 trial that has a similar design. The Company expects to file the BLA in Q4 2018.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company expects total revenue to be between $90 to $110 million in 2018. Gross margin is expected to improve primarily as a result of enhancements to Evomela manufacturing. R&D expense is expected increase driven by additional spend on pipeline.\nThree-Month Period Ended December 31, 2017 (All numbers are approximate)\nGAAP Results\nTotal product sales were $27.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Non-GAAP financial measures differ from financial statements reported in conformity to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). In accordance with Regulation G, we reconciled each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management uses non-GAAP financial measures to assess our company’s performance and allocate company resources, and believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures allows investors to view the Company’s financial results in the way that management views the financial results. We believe non-GAAP disclosures also provide investors with information used generally in our industry for evaluating operating results. Investors should not place undue reliance on non-GAAP financial measures, nor should investors consider non-GAAP financial measures as more meaningful than, or as substitutes or replacements for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented exclude the items summarized in the below table. Management believes that adjustments for these items assist investors in making comparisons of period-to-period operating results and that these items are not indicative of the Company’s on-going core operating performance.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures presented herein have certain limitations in that they do not reflect all of the costs associated with the operations of the Company’s business as reported under GAAP. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or as superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented by the Company may be different from the non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nSPECTRUM PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Adjustments for Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(In thousands, expect per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (1 ) GAAP product sales, net & license fees and service revenue $ 28,569 $ 35,236 $ 128,367 $ 146,444 Non-GAAP adjustments to product sales, net & license fees and service revenue: — — (5,000 ) (6,000 ) Non-GAAP product sales, net & license fees and service revenue $ 28,569 $ 35,236 $ 123,367 $ 140,444 (2 ) GAAP selling, general and administrative expenses $ 29,214 $ 18,866 $ 84,267 $ 88,418 Non-GAAP adjustments to SG&A: Stock-based compensation (2,997 ) (2,768 ) (11,521 ) (11,481 ) Severance and legal expenses (7,080 ) — (7,080 ) — Litigation expenses — (387 ) — (12,333 ) Depreciation expense (76 ) (103 ) (316 ) (535 ) Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative $ 19,061 $ 15,608 $ 65,350 $ 64,069 (3 ) GAAP research and development $ 22,134 $ 15,995 $ 65,895 $ 59,123 Non-GAAP adjustments to R&D: Stock-based compensation (557 ) (554 ) (2,235 ) (2,190 ) Depreciation expense (2 ) (3 ) (9 ) (11 ) Other R&D milestone payments (250 ) — (250 ) (2,826 ) Non-GAAP research and development $ 21,325 $ 15,438 $ 63,401 $ 54,096 (4 ) GAAP net loss $ (28,556 ) $ (18,104 ) $ (91,248 ) $ (69,770 ) Non-GAAP adjustments to net loss: Adjustments to product sales, net & license fees and service revenue, SG&A, and R&D as noted above 10,962 3,815 16,411 23,376 Adjustment to cost of sales — — 1,000 — Amortization and impairment charges of intangible assets 6,929 6,894 27,647 25,946 Adjustments to other (expense) income 3,258 959 10,914 6,011 Adjustments to benefit for income taxes (15,366 ) (1,677 ) (16,778 ) (2,313 ) Non-GAAP net loss $ (22,773 ) $ (8,113 ) $ (52,054 ) $ (16,750 ) (5 ) GAAP loss per share (Basic and Diluted) $ (0.29 ) $ (0.23 ) $ (1.07 ) $ (0.96 ) Non-GAAP loss per share (Basic and Diluted) $ (0.23 ) $ (0.10 ) $ (0.61 ) $ (0.23 ) Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic and Diluted 98,366,416 78,401,381 85,115,592 72,824,070 (1) Non-GAAP product sales, net & license fees and service revenue: These amounts reflect adjustments to reverse revenue recognition for upfront revenue from out-licenses and revenue from milestone achievement(s) that do not consistently recur. The resulting non-GAAP revenue solely consists of our (i) product sales, (ii) percentage-based royalties from our licensees’ sales, and (iii) on-going service revenue. We believe this measure of non-GAAP revenue is more indicative of the period-over-period success of our core ongoing product sales and service revenue.\n(2) Non-GAAP selling, general and administrative: These amounts reflect adjustments to reverse allocated operating expenses for certain non-cash items (including stock-based compensation and depreciation), as well as the reversal of irregular operating expense items such as non-recurring legal fees, settlements and severance. We believe the resulting non-GAAP SG&A value is more indicative of the period-over-period success of our administrative expense control, and more reflective of our normalized SG&A expense trends.\n(3) Non-GAAP research and development: These amounts reflect adjustments to reverse allocated operating expenses for certain non-cash items (including stock-based compensation and depreciation), as well as non-recurring R&D milestone achievements that we record to expense for our in-licenses. We believe the resulting non-GAAP R&D value is more reflective of our true R&D expense trends.\n(4) Non-GAAP net loss: These amounts reflect all non-GAAP adjustments described in (1) through (3) above, plus other non-cash and/or non-recurring items, including: (i) adjustments to reverse royalty expense on receipts from regulatory and sales milestone achievements; (ii) adjustments to reverse operating expenses for non-cash amortization and impairment of intangible assets (the reversal of these non-cash expenses allows for a clearer representation of the period-over-period success of our overall financial results and future working capital requirements); (iii) adjustments to reverse the impact of income taxes; (iv) adjustments to reverse the impact of mark-to-market contingent consideration (although our contingent consideration results from prior acquisitions and is a part of our business strategy, these adjustments through earnings typically result from variables other than our current commercial activity or other operating performance measures that are a focus of our management), (v) reversal of foreign exchange gains and losses (non-cash), (vi) debt discount accretion expense (non-cash) for our convertible notes, and (vii) the loss recorded on the convertible notes repurchase.\n(5) Non-GAAP loss per share: These amounts reflect all non-GAAP adjustments in (1) through (4) above to present our overall non-GAAP financial results for each period on a per-share basis.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180306006616/en/\nSpectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nShiv Kapoor\nVice President, Strategic Planning & Investor Relations\n702-835-6300\nInvestorRelations@sppirx.com\nSource: Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",
