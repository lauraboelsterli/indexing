    "text": "– Full Year Revenues More than Doubled; Fourth Quarter Increased 9.1% Sequentially –\nHOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cactus, Inc. (NYSE: WHD) (“Cactus” or the “Company”) today announced financial and operating results for the full year and fourth quarter of 2017. On February 12, 2018, Cactus closed its initial public offering (“IPO”) of Class A common stock. The financial results for 2017 and 2016 represent periods during which Cactus’ operating subsidiary was privately-owned.\nKey 2017 Operational Highlights\nGrew estimated U.S. onshore market share (1) in wellhead product line from 21.2% for fourth quarter 2016 to 26.0% for fourth quarter 2017; Developed and commercialized further innovations in frac rental offerings to reduce repair time and enhance reliability; Initiated expansion of its rental fleet to capitalize on higher intensity fracs and larger pad sizes; and Expanded Suzhou, China facility to improve product and rental margins.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nIncreased revenues 120.1% to $341.2 million from $155.0 million in 2016; Grew income from operations to $88.9 million from $10.6 million in 2016; Grew net income to $66.5 million from a net loss of $8.2 million in 2016; and Increased Adjusted EBITDA (2) and related margin (3) to $112.1 million and 32.9%, respectively, from $32.2 million and 20.8%, respectively, in 2016.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights and Recent Events\nReported financial results that were in-line with preliminary estimates from the Company’s prospectus filed with the SEC; Increased revenues 9.1% to $104.8 million from $96.0 million in the preceding quarter; Generated income from operations and net income of $28.7 million and $22.8 million, respectively; Increased Adjusted EBITDA (2) to $35.0 million from $34.1 million in the preceding quarter; and Completed an upsized IPO (4) in February that allowed the Company to repay its term loan in full.\nFinancial Summary\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 (in thousands) (in thousands) Revenues $ 104,784\n$ 96,027 $ 49,547 $ 341,191\n$ 155,048 Income from operations $ 28,737 $ 28,059 $ 6,162 $ 88,863 $ 10,615 Operating income margin 27.4\n% 29.2 % 12.4 % 26.0 % 6.8 % Net income (loss) $ 22,814 $ 22,301 $ 1,346 $ 66,547 $ (8,176 ) Adjusted EBITDA (2) $ 35,032 $ 34,133 $ 11,461 $ 112,134 $ 32,217 Adjusted EBITDA margin (3) 33.4\n% 35.5 % 23.1 % 32.9\n% 20.8 % (1) See definition and calculation of market share in the Supplemental Information tables.

Scott Bender, President and CEO of Cactus, commented, “Supported by our talented team, Cactus entered 2017 well positioned to take advantage of the expected improvements in the U.S. onshore unconventional oil and gas market. As evidenced by our outstanding year-over-year financial results, the benefits of our product and service offerings continued to attract a growing customer base. This resulted in further market share increases, including during the second half of 2017.\n“Benefiting from the increasing onshore rig count and the number and complexity of wells that are forecast in 2018, we expect another strong year for the Company in 2018 and remain focused on generating superior results and industry leading returns,” added Mr. Bender. “Working closely with our customers, we look forward to providing additional safety and efficiency enhancements to our products and services. In addition, through our recent very successful IPO, we are now well positioned to further grow the business through execution of strategic initiatives that are well aligned with our core competencies while maintaining our focus on return on capital,” concluded Mr. Bender.\nRevenue Categories\nProduct\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 (in thousands) (in thousands) Product revenue $ 57,128 $ 53,680 $ 25,929 $ 189,091 $ 77,739 Gross profit $ 19,662 $ 19,807 $ 5,962 $ 65,061 $ 14,973 Gross margin 34.4 % 36.9 % 23.0 % 34.4 % 19.3 % Fourth quarter 2017 product revenue was up $3.4 million, or 6.4%, sequentially and $31.2 million, or 120.3%, year-over-year. The sequential increase was driven primarily by greater sales volume of production valves and wellhead equipment during the fourth quarter. As expected, gross profit decreased $0.1 million sequentially with margins declining 250 basis points due to a combination of seasonal impacts, higher volume of lower margin commoditized production valves, and greater reliance on the Company’s relatively higher cost U.S. facility related to specific customer orders in excess of expectations. Cactus’ estimated market share was 26.0% for the fourth quarter 2017 compared to 25.6% for the third quarter 2017, while the U.S. onshore quarterly rig count averaged 900 rigs in the fourth quarter 2017 down from 924 rigs in the third quarter 2017.\nRental\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 (in thousands) (in thousands) Rental revenue $ 24,490\n$ 21,199 $ 13,171 $ 77,469\n$ 44,372 Gross profit $ 12,144 $ 10,513 $ 5,119 $ 36,950 $ 10,382 Gross margin 49.6\n% 49.6 % 38.9 % 47.7\n% 23.4 % Fourth quarter 2017 rental revenue was up $3.3 million, or 15.5%, sequentially and $11.3 million, or 85.9%, year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to higher demand for frac valves, reflecting greater completions activity across the major U.S. basins in which the Company participates, as well as an increase in Cactus’ rental asset fleet from the capital investments made throughout 2017. Gross profit increased $1.6 million sequentially with margins flat due to higher repair costs in the fourth quarter related to the redeployment of previously underutilized rental assets into basins where activity continues to increase.\nField Service and Other\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 (in thousands) (in thousands) Field service and other revenue $ 23,166 $ 21,148 $ 10,447 $ 74,631 $ 32,937 Gross profit $ 3,575 $ 4,835 $ 680 $ 14,029 $ 4,467 Gross margin 15.4 % 22.9 % 6.5 % 18.8 % 13.6 % Fourth quarter 2017 field service and other revenue was up $2.0 million, or 9.5%, sequentially and $12.7 million, or 121.7%, year-over-year. The sequential increase was due to increased billable hours related to installations. Gross profit declined $1.3 million sequentially with margins decreasing 750 basis points due to seasonal impacts during the fourth quarter. In addition, the Company experienced higher nonbillable and training time related to the strategic ramp up in field service headcount in preparation for an expected increase in U.S. onshore market activity during 2018.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (“SG&A”)\nSG&A for the fourth quarter 2017 was $6.6 million (6.3% of revenue), compared to $7.1 million (7.4% of revenue) for the third quarter 2017 and $5.6 million (11.3% of revenue) for the fourth quarter 2016. The sequential decline is primarily due to $0.3 million lower legal and professional fees, $0.3 million lower costs incurred during the fourth quarter 2017 associated with preparing to be a public company, and a $0.1 million recovery of bad debt, offset by a $0.2 million increase in costs associated with higher headcount. The fourth quarter year-over-year increase relates to higher headcount associated with significant growth in the business during 2017 and expectations for 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Expenditures\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $248.5 million outstanding under its term loan and cash on hand of $7.6 million. The Company’s revolving credit facility was undrawn and total availability as of December 31, 2017 was $50.0 million. In conjunction with the Company’s IPO, the outstanding term loan was repaid in full.\nNet capital expenditures for the fourth quarter 2017 were $9.3 million and $30.7 million for the full year 2017. The majority of the spend related to the addition of rental equipment, particularly frac valves and drilling tools.\nRecent Events\nOn February 12, 2018, Cactus closed its IPO of Class A common shares. Including the exercise in full of the underwriters’ option to purchase an additional 15% of common shares, the Company issued a total of 26,450,000 shares of Class A common stock in the IPO at $19.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $467.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. Cactus contributed all of the net proceeds of the IPO to its limited liability company operating subsidiary in exchange for units.\nThe Company caused its operating subsidiary to use the net proceeds to (i) fully repay the outstanding term loan facility, plus accrued interest, of the operating subsidiary of $251.0 million and (ii) distribute $216.4 million pari passu to the legacy owners of the operating subsidiary as part of the corporate reorganization undertaken in connection with the IPO. In conjunction with the IPO, there are 48,439,772 Class B common shares issued and outstanding, representing the remaining units held by the legacy owners of the operating subsidiary.\nFurther information on the IPO can be found in the prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).\nIn January 2018, Cactus made a $26.0 million tax distribution payment to legacy owners related to the tax liabilities incurred prior to the IPO. The payment was funded through the borrowing of $26.0 million under the Company’s revolving credit facility.\nAs of March 7, 2018, Cactus had $8.0 million drawn under the revolving credit facility and $14.0 million cash on hand.\nConference Call Details\nCactus will host a conference call to discuss financial and operational results on Friday, March 9, 2018 at 9:00 AM Central Time (10:00 AM Eastern Time).\nThe call will be webcast on Cactus’ website at www.CactusWHD.com .

Cactus believes that comparing the total number of active U.S. onshore rigs to which it was providing its products and services at a given time to the number of active U.S. onshore rigs during the same period provides Cactus with a reasonable approximation of its market share with respect to wellhead products sold and the corresponding services it provides.\nCactus – Supplemental Information\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (2)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended Year Ended December 31,\n2017 September 30,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 (in thousands) Net income (loss) $ 22,814 $ 22,301 $ 1,346 $ 66,547 $ (8,176 ) Interest expense, net 5,316 5,279 4,964 20,767 20,233 Income tax expense 607 479 (148 ) 1,549 809 Depreciation and amortization 6,295 6,074 5,299 23,271 21,241 EBITDA (2) 35,032 34,133 11,461 112,134 34,107 (Gain) loss on debt extinguishment - - - - (2,251 ) Stock-based compensation - - - - 361 Adjusted EBITDA (2) $ 35,032 $ 34,133 $ 11,461 $ 112,134 $ 32,217 (2) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures of net income as determined by GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management and external users of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies. Cactus defines EBITDA as net income before net interest expense, income tax and depreciation and amortization. Cactus defines Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding (gain) loss on debt extinguishment and stock-based compensation. Cactus management believes EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful because they allow management to more effectively evaluate the Company’s operating performance and compare the results of its operations from period to period without regard to financing methods or capital structure, or other items that impact comparability of financial results from period to period. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as alternatives to, or more meaningful than, net income or any other measure as determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s computations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Cactus presents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because it believes they provide useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting the Company’s business.
