    "text": "SAN DIEGO, March 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ImageWare ® Systems, Inc. (OTCQB:IWSY), a leader in mobile and cloud-based, multi-modal biometric identity management solutions, reported financial results for fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. The revenue for both periods primarily reflects our legacy business.\nQ4 Summary of Results\nRevenue for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 increased 32% to $1,221,000 from $925,000 in the fourth quarter 2016. Gross profit for the quarter was $975,000 (80%) as compared with $641,000 (69%). Net loss was $2.4 million in the quarter compared with $2.7 million in the fourth quarter 2016.\nYear-End Summary of Results\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 14% to $4.3 million as compared with $3.8 million for the year ended 2016. Gross profit for 2017 was $3.3 million (77%) compared with $2.7 million (72%) in 2016. Net loss for the year was $13.7 million in 2017 as compared with $10.9 million in 2016. Cash at year-end 2017 was $7.3 million as compared with $1.6 million at year-end 2016.\nRecent Significant Events\nImageWare entered a new large and lucrative vertical – the healthcare market\nLife Med ID is our newest marketing and sales partner using GoVerifyID ® to provide multi-modal biometric authentication to patient identity in healthcare. Fujitsu has added the IWS pillphone ® to its sales and marketing agreement with ImageWare and has introduced its own healthcare product for patient-physician engagement. In addition to connecting a medical care team to patients, the application secures communications using the Biometrics-as-a-Service ™ (BIOaaS™) platform from Fujitsu, which provides secure multi-modal biometrics for patient identity verification without requiring passwords. Our GoVerifyID (GVID) is the multi-modal component in this solution. Fujitsu extended its sales and marketing agreement with ImageWare to include Australia. Fujitsu licensed ImageWare’s GVID technology for use across additional countries in the Americas. CDW made its first sale of ImageWare’s GVID enterprise product in the financial services market.\nJim Miller, Chairman and CEO of ImageWare Systems said, “Revenues in 2017 continued to reflect primarily our legacy business, however, we made great strides in the year toward transitioning the company to a recurring revenue model. We look forward to seeing meaningful revenues begin from the recurring model as early as the second quarter of 2018. Feedback we are receiving from our sales partners show they have every expectation of sales beginning to ramp in that timeframe.\n“We saw our first sales under that model in Q1 from CDW. Fujitsu is building its sales force along with developing its customer support capability, which is essential for enterprise and consumer rollouts. Thus far, we have trained more than 150 Fujitsu employees in these functions. These milestones, when combined with other initiatives and healthcare’s higher per-user/per-month price point, give us a high level of confidence that we are on the right track toward profitability and cash flow breakeven,” Miller concluded.\n2017 Year-End Financial Results Conference Call\nThe Company will host an investor conference call on Monday, March 19, 2018 at 1:30pm PT (4:30pm ET).The Participant Dial-In Number for the conference call is Domestic/International 1-778-327-3988.
