    "text": "2 COMMENTS ‘Painting is poetry that is seen rather than felt, and poetry is painting that is felt rather than seen,” observed Leonardo da Vinci in a quotation that opens “World Make Way” (Abrams, 48 pages, $16.99) , a collection of newly commissioned verses matched with works of art from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The book’s title comes from the first composition, an extended expression of impatience written by Marilyn Singer that is paired with the lavender and white beauty of Gustav Klimt’s “Mäda Primavesi” (1912). In Klimt’s full-length portrait (see right), a flower-decked girl in white stands with one arm cocked on her hip, looking straight ahead. “Hurry up and paint me. / I have things to do . . . ,” Ms. Singer imagines her telling the artist. “I’m young, a girl, it’s true, / but I insist, / World, make way.”\nThe contemporary emphasis on a particular kind of diversity is on full display in this handsome book, edited by Lee Bennett Hopkins : Fifteen of the 18 featured poets are women, and the artwork is drawn with scrupulous balance from a wide variety of cultures and time periods, including eighth-century China, 17th-century India, 19th-century Japan and 21st-century America. Beautiful as many of the pictures are, and some of the verses too, the art selections feel random and the tone at times surprisingly plaintive, given that “World Make Way” is intended for 4- to 8-year-olds. “Whether you’re a woman, whether you’re black, / no matter who you are, you can make art,” Marilyn Nelson states in her poem, “Studio.” Is someone telling children otherwise?\nPhoto: Bridgeman Images Looking at art doesn’t always stir the soul, but when it does the sensation can be so powerful as to feel like a subsuming rapture. Geraldo Valério manages to replicate this dizzying and rare experience in “Blue Rider” (Groundwood, 42 pages, $19.95) , a wordless picture book for children ages 4-7. Blues, beiges and browns predominate in the first few pages, as a child with a backpack joins the throng on a busy city street. But what’s this—a book lying on the pavement? Smiling, the child trots off with it to her room, a small cube in a huge, soulless apartment building. It is there that the magic happens.\nFrom the girl’s point of view, we see the book lying open to reveal a picture of a brilliant blue horse with an orange and fuchsia mane flying through an indigo sky. Instantly the child (and the reader) seems to enter the vivid, Matisse-like, torn-paper artwork, going deeper and deeper into the illustrations with each turn of the page in a thrilling assault on the eyes for everyone involved. Later the girl holds the book to her heart, and we can see from her beatific expression how its beauty and color have exalted her. We can also tell, from the bright hues of her transformed bedroom, that the world may never look quite so dull to her again.\nIn traditional fairy stories, the stepmother is a villain who shunts aside or tries to kill the children of her husband’s first marriage (think “Cinderella,” “Snow White” and variants of “Hansel and Gretel”). In a retelling of “Wild Swans” (Barefoot Books, 48 pages, $9.99) , Xanthe Gresham Knight attempts the rehabilitation of this vilified stock character by casting her as a healer and something of an intellectual.\nIn the 1838 Hans Christian Andersen tale, the king’s new wife banishes her young stepdaughter and, out of malice, turns the girl’s 11 brothers into swans. In this adaptation, with disease stalking the land, she performs these acts to save the royal children: “In times of plague, a crown can’t keep you safe,” the woman says, “but I can.” The swan-boys fly away while their sister, Eliza, is dispatched to a remote village away from the pestilence. There the girl remains until she is 16, when she learns (from talking frogs, because this is a fairy tale) that even as her stepmother finally found a cure for the plague, she has died of it. As in Andersen’s telling, the only way Eliza can break the spell on her brothers is to weave shirts for them of stinging nettles without once talking or weeping. While she’s weaving in silence, the young king of a neighboring realm encounters her and invites her to his palace.\nThis paperback, suitable for reading aloud or for solo enjoyment by children ages 8-12, is made elegant by Charlotte Gastaut’s exquisite illustrations. Ms. Gastaut’s aesthetic here resembles a cross between Art Deco and Eastern European folk design. She uses lots of rich reds and blues and the shapes of arcs and rays, and she dresses her characters in clothing embroidered with roses and vines. For some children, however, the story’s egalitarian ending will disappoint. Once Eliza’s trials are over and her brothers are (mostly) restored to their human forms, does the nice young king propose a happy-ever-after marriage like a normal fairy-tale hero? No, he does not. Instead he invites Eliza to stay on as a friend “and serve as his new advisor.” Now where’s the romance in that?\nWith breezy, joyful illustrations and just a few words on each page, Matt Phelan invites 2- to 6-year-olds to frisk about al fresco in his picture book “Pignic” (Greenwillow, 32 pages, $17.99) . As the title implies and the pictures confirm, a “pignic” is what happens when a pink porcine family trots along to a lovely green hill in the countryside with a basket filled with good things to eat (“Pretzels! Pies! Pickles! And plums!”).\nMr. Phelan’s pencil-and-watercolor pictures exude good humor, even when things go wrong. When a frustrated piglet can’t reach a tree branch to climb (“Uh-oh”), a tortoise moseys up to give him a boost. Then a big bad wolf—here a big blue wolf—tiptoes menacingly up behind two piglets who are trying to launch a kite. “Uh-oh,” we read, wondering if the wolf will bite. “No wind,” the piglets tell him. The wolf looks nonplussed for a moment, then with a mighty “huff” and “puff” blows the kite up into the sky. Ah, but then the skies darken, and rain comes thundering down. It would be the doom of any regular picnic. Fortunately, this is a pig nic: “Mud? Mud! Hooray!”",
