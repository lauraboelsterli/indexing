The consolidated financial statements have been audited.\nA certification report is being prepared.\nAudited figures, in € million (IFRS)\n2017 2016 Change Revenues 235.5 319.1 -26% Cost of sales (237.9) (284.2) -21% Gross margin % of revenues\n(2.3) (1)%\n34.9 10.9%\nAdministrative and commercial expenses (32.6) (35.2) -7% EBITDA* (27.6) 3.8 Current operating income % of revenues\n(34.9) (14.8)%\n(0.3) (0.1)%\nOther operating income and expenses (4.4) (6.6) Operating income (39.3) (6.9) Share of equity-accounted companies Financial profit\nTax\n(0.1) (3.5)\n0\n0.0 (2.2)\n2.0\nConsolidated net income (42.9) (7.1) Net income, Group share (42.9) (7.2) * EBITDA: Current operating income before amortisation, depreciation and provisions.\n2017 revenues: €235,5 million\nHeurtey Petrochem generated consolidated revenues of €235.5 million in 2017, down 26% compared to 2016. The Gas branch accounted for 31% of revenues, while the Furnaces branch represented 69% (31% refining, 16% petrochemicals, 22% hydrogen). The activity has been realized at 26% from the Americas, 37% from Asia/Oceania, 30% from Middle East/Africa and 7% from Europe/Russia.\nA significant decrease of current operating profit in the two businesses\nThe Group’s gross margin, which came out at -€2,3 million, represents -1% of the Group’s revenues, with the results shown below of the two branches.\n€ million\nFurnaces Gas processing 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenues 162.8 246.7 72.7 72.4 Gross margin % of revenues\n0 0%\n32.5 13.2%\n(2.3) (3.2)%\n2.5 3.4%\nCurrent operating income % of revenues\n(23.4) (14.4)%\n7.4 3.0%\n(11.5) (15.8)%\n(7.7) (10.6)%\nThe Furnaces branch is strongly hit by the fall in business volume, coming from the low level of order intake over the year along with some cost overruns on contracts during construction phase and warranty. The Gas branch recorded steady revenues compared to 2016 considering the opening backlog, however the gross margin shows a significant decrease due to difficulties encountered in some projects during completion phase.\nThe administrative and commercial costs at €32,6 million dropped by 7% taking into account the savings made by the Group.\nThe Group’s current operating income came out at -€34.9 million (-14,8%) of consolidated revenues with a current operating loss of -14,4% in the Furnaces branch and -15.8% in the Gas branch.\nAfter taking into account a non-recurring operating expense of €4.4 million, mainly stemming from €1.2 million costs of workforce reduction and €2,7 million costs related to the relocation of Prosernat and Heurtey head offices, the Group recorded an operating loss of €39.3 million.\nThe Group registered a financial loss of -€3.5 million, of which -€0.9 million in interest expenses, stable compared to 2016, and -€2.6 million in exchange losses.\nAs a precaution, the Group did not record any deferred tax asset for the fiscal losses generated over the period, therefore, the net consolidated result amounted to -€42.9 million.\nStrong decrease of order intakes\nIn a persistently difficult market environment, the Group recorded €144 million of order intakes in 2017, 56% less than in 2016. The Furnaces segment accounted for 75% of these orders (24% in refining, 39% in hydrogen and 12% in petrochemicals), while the Gas segment represented 25%. This can be broken down as follows: 21% from the Americas, 54% from Asia/Oceania, 17% from Middle East/Africa and 8% from Europe/Russia.\nFinancial status\nAs of 31 December 2017, the Group has €26.5 million of financial debt (including €15 million overdrafts), down €13.5 million compared to 2016. Further to the repayment of its syndicated loan – mid-term debt and revolving credit – the Group is now mainly financed by Axens through current account advances. As of 31 December 2017, these advances amounted to €56 million. The marketable securities, cash and cash equivalents amounted to +€38.5 million.\nThe cash consumed in operating activities is €38.7 million due to operating losses over the period.\nThe closing net cash amount to €23.5 million compared to €13.3 million in 2016.\nOutlook 2017\nThe backlog as of 31 December 2017 was €177 million. In 2017, the Group has decided to adjust the backlog by deducting €107 million related to the contracts signed with Venezuelans clients, on hold for several years and for which the re-start is not anticipated considering the economic and political situation of this country.\nThe backlog of €177 million is down compared to €304 million as at 31 December 2016 after adjustment of Venezuelan contracts.\nThe Gas branch accounted for 48% of backlog, and the Furnaces branch for 52% (26% refining, 15% hydrogen and 11% petrochemicals). The Americas accounted for 57% of the backlog, Asia/Oceania 21%, Middle East/Africa 18%, and Europe/Russia 4%.\nThe Group has now completed the merger of its commercial and operational activities of project execution in France for its Furnaces and Gas businesses in a joint management and a full merge of its technical disciplines (engineering, purchasing, inspection, documentation control) and its support services.\nThe Group has now, in 2018, a safer project execution base and more efficient and better-coordinated resources for the execution of its turnkey projects.\nIn 2018, the Group will continue the merge with its shareholder Axens with the objective of securing its recovery and implementing the commercial synergies.\nFor 2018, the Group is expecting the market environment to remain difficult, and has set its target revenues between €250 million and €280 million.\nNext press release: Q1 2018 revenues, 17 May 2018 after market close\nAbout Heurtey Petrochem ( www.heurtey.com )\nHeurtey Petrochem is a global oil and gas engineering group operating across two market segments:\nProcess furnaces for refining, petrochemicals and hydrogen production.
