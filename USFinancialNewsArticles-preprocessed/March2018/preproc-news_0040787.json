    "text": "ST. JOHN’S, Newfoundland and Labrador--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Altius Minerals Corporation (“Altius”) is pleased to announce that together with a private third party it has agreed to purchase an additional 44.9% interest in Potash Royalty Limited Partnership (“Potash Royalties”) from Liberty Metals & Mining Holdings, LLC for total cash consideration of C$75 million plus nominal price adjustments. Of this amount, Altius will pay C$65 million to bring its total interest in Potash Royalties to 91.3%, from its current 52.4% interest.\nPotash Royalties generates royalty revenue from six producing potash mines located in Saskatchewan, Canada including Nutrien’s Rocanville, Vanscoy, Allan, Cory and Patience Lake mines and The Mosaic Company’s Esterhazy mine.\nAt current throughput rates these assets have an estimated average remaining mine-life of 49 years using reserves and resources and not including considerable inferred resources and additional exploration potential. Following recent major capacity expansions, the mines have the collective potential to almost double production throughput before reaching their nameplate capacities. Global potash demand continues to grow steadily, achieving a new record level last year, while prices appear to have recently begun to rebound from cyclical lows.\nFinancing for the transaction will be sourced from Altius’s existing balance sheet liquidity, which consists of approximately C$130 million in cash and unused revolving credit facilities. It is anticipated that the transaction will close on or before March 31, 2018, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nBrian Dalton, President and CEO of Altius commented: “Royalties such as these are rare and exceptional. This acquisition increases Altius’s exposure to the world’s premiere potash mines and to some of the best free long-term optionality to be found anywhere in the overall resource royalty sector. We are delighted to increase our ownership at this particularly opportune point in the life-cycle of these mines.”\nScotiabank is acting as financial adviser to Altius in relation to this transaction.\nAbout Altius\nAltius directly and indirectly holds diversified royalties and streams that generate revenue from 15 operating mines. These are located in Canada and Brazil and produce copper, zinc, nickel, cobalt, iron ore, potash and thermal (electrical) and metallurgical coal. The portfolio also includes numerous pre‐development stage royalties covering a wide spectrum of mineral commodities and jurisdictions. In addition, Altius’s Project Generation business holds a large portfolio of exploration stage projects which it has generated for deal making with industry partners that results in newly created royalties and equity and minority interests.\nAltius has 43,215,026 shares issued and outstanding that are listed on Canada’s Toronto Stock Exchange. It is a member of both the S&P/TSX Small Cap and S&P/TSX Global Mining Indices.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180322005385/en/\nAltius\nFlora Wood, 1-877-576-2209\nflora@altiusminerals.com\nSource: Altius Minerals Corporation",
