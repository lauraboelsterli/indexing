    "text": "4 COMMENTS The starfish brooch is huge and heavy, the size of the palm of your hand. Its five gold rays, studded with 71 rubies and 241 amethysts, are articulated so that if you touch them they curl up, as though alive. Three versions of this pin were made in the mid-1930s by a famous Parisian jeweler. What kind of woman would wear such a splashy piece of jewelry? One was the film star Claudette Colbert. The second was the Standard Oil heiress Millicent Rogers. The third is a mystery.\nFreelance journalist Cherie Burns became obsessed with the brooch after seeing one of them at a book launch for her 2011 life of Rogers, “Searching for Beauty.” During the party, which was held in a private Manhattan jewelry salon, the owner took her over to a glass showcase. Ms. Burns writes, “The starfish looked real enough to climb out of the case and march up my arm. . . . It seemed not just to sparkle, but also to effervesce as if it were visibly radioactive.”\nShe was dazzled by it, so much so that she returned the next day for another look. But the brooch was gone. Where was it? The owner of the jewelry store was tight-lipped and vague. “ ‘A jeweler in London, I think,’ he said before he waved good-bye and jauntily retreated down the hall to his office.”\nObsessed with the starfish now, Ms. Burns was determined to try to find out more about all three brooches, who had worn them and where they had ended up. Part history, part investigative journalism, part personal quest, “Diving for Starfish” is filled with drama and intrigue, and peopled by a cast of characters worthy of “The Maltese Falcon.” Like Dashiell Hammett’s hard-boiled detective Sam Spade, Ms. Burns comes up against more than she had bargained for when she first set out on her search for information. Her trail takes her to London, Paris, Hollywood and Miami, turning hot and cold along the way.\nPhoto: WSJ Diving for Starfish By Cherie Burns\nSt. Martin’s, 230 pages. $26.99\nShe quickly discovers that the high-end jewelry business is deeply secretive and doesn’t welcome even the most innocent of questions. She calls it a “shadow business.” The worst sin a person in the trade can commit is to reveal the name of a buyer. Jewelry may be kept secret for tax reasons. Men usually buy it for women, and some establishments even have two entrances in case a wife and a mistress arrive at the same time.\nThe jeweler that created the starfish was the House of Boivin, which opened in the 1890s. In the 1930s it came out with complex, innovative creations that were a radical departure from the geometric Art Deco pieces that had been so popular in the previous decade. Boivin’s designers, three women (unusual for the time), had a playful sense of humor. They made shells, sea creatures and flowers such as orchids and foxgloves—but their work wasn’t sentimental. The craftsmanship established the value of the jewelry, not the gems. The pieces weren’t signed—and they didn’t need to be. The jewelry was an art form, the designers (who often didn’t even bother to keep the drawings) immediately recognizable.\nBoivin was nothing if not exclusive. It never advertised and had no ground-floor window displays. Patrons were admitted by referral only. The look of the store was very different from the traditional silk, velvet and wood paneling of other establishments. Straw marquetry covered the walls, wood fretwork was painted to look like white enamel, and the air was filled with the aroma of sandalwood incense. The showroom was like a salon. In addition to the usual panoply of royals and socialites, the group that gathered there included Freud, Satie, Bonnard, Degas, Colette, Cocteau and Cole Porter. What did they talk about as they looked over such treasures as a chameleon brooch that could change its color with a push of its tongue?\nWhile Ms. Burns was able to learn a great deal about Boivin’s history, she had less luck when it came to information from the jeweler about its starfish. Intrigue and conjecture surrounded the provenance of its pieces, since the archive has been kept for the most part private. Nathalie Hocq, the owner of Boivin since 2000, wants to keep it that way. Françoise Cailles, the house authenticator, whose certification is needed for a sale, is equally close-mouthed: “She steadfastly refuses to show what she has, or as she explains most things, they are a secret .”\nThe person who might have helped Ms. Burns the most in her quest was the legendary Fred Leighton. The son of a Bronx cabdriver whose real name was Murray Mondschein, he was a major presence in the world of fancy jewelry. Every great piece, it seemed, had passed though his hands, including the Millicent Rogers starfish. When Ms. Burns finally runs into him, “a man in a black raincoat with a stringy ponytail comb-over covering his bald spots,” he won’t talk to her. “What’s it benefit me?” he asks unsmiling before he disappears. He died two years later.\nAs for Claudette Colbert’s brooch, the executor of her estate tells her it may have been lost some time in the 1950s, left in a blue Pan Am bag on a seat in a waiting room. But Ms. Burns is not done yet. She asks the opinion of a former close friend of Colbert’s, a crusty 88-year-old who is a major collector of Asian art. She shows him a life-size photograph of the starfish, hoping he might shed further light upon the subject. He’s unimpressed. Too big and too gaudy. If he’d seen it, he says, “I would have thrown it in the fireplace.”\nMs. Hodgson is the author of “It Seemed Like a Good Idea at the Time: My Adventures in Life and Food.”",
