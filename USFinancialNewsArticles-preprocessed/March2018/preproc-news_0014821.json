    "text": "LITTLE FALLS, N.J., March 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Cantel Medical Corp. (NYSE: CMD) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended January 31, 2018.\nJørgen B. Hansen, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"We are pleased to report record sales and earnings performance this quarter. Our 15.3% reported sales increase was driven by organic growth of 10.0%, the impact from acquisitions of 4.2%, and a favorable impact from foreign currency of 1.1%. We continue to outperform internationally where sales were up 43.0% overall, while our US business had a strong quarter with 7.9% growth.\"\nFinancial Highlights:\nEndoscopy sales grew 23.6%, with strong organic growth of 13.8%, showing continued performance across our core product lines. Recurring revenue for this segment was up 20.9%, and favorable product mix drove margin rate expansion. Reported sales in Water Purification and Filtration increased 7.4%, as a strong backlog translated into increased shipments for the quarter. Healthcare Disposables reported strong year over year growth of 6.2%, with 5.5% organic, driven by the strategic branded portfolio which grew by 9.2%.\nThe Company's balance sheet continues to generate significant cash flow and EBITDAS. The second quarter ended with cash of $40.0M and gross debt of $160.0M, while generating adjusted EBITDAS of $45.9M in the quarter, up 16.2%.\nAs a result of the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company's tax rate decreased in the quarter, and the Company had a net benefit comprised of the favorable one-time benefit related to a revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by the unfavorable impact related to the mandatory transition tax for deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income. The Company plans to release updated guidance for fiscal year 2018, along with the expected full year effective tax rate during the quarterly earnings call.\nConference Call Information:\nThe Company will hold a conference call to discuss the results for its second quarter ended January 31, 2018 on Thursday, March 8, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time.\nTo participate in the conference call, dial 1-877-407-8033 (US & Canada) or 1-201-689-8033 (International) approximately 5 to 10 minutes before the beginning of the call.

These non-GAAP financial measures are indicators of the Company's performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. They are presented with the intent of providing greater transparency to financial information used by us in our financial analysis and operational decision-making. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors, stockholders and other readers of our consolidated financial statements in making comparisons to our historical operating results and analyzing the underlying performance of our results of operations. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be, and should not be, considered separately from, or as an alternative to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nTo measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. These adjustments are irregular in timing, may not be indicative of our past and future performance and are therefore excluded to allow investors to better understand underlying operating trends. The following are examples of the types of adjustments that are excluded: (i) amortization of purchased intangible assets; (ii) acquisition-related items; (iii) business optimization and restructuring-related charges; (iv) net tax benefits associated with the estimated impact of the revaluation of our U.S. net deferred tax liabilities as a result of U.S. tax reform and the unfavorable impact of a repatriation tax; (v) excess tax benefits applicable to stock compensation and (vi) other significant items management deems irregular or non-operating in nature.\nAmortization expense of purchased intangible assets is a non-cash expense related to intangibles that were primarily the result of business acquisitions. Our history of acquiring businesses has resulted in significant increases in amortization of intangible assets that reduce the Company's net income. The removal of amortization from our overall operating performance helps in assessing our cash generated from operations including our return on invested capital, which we believe is an important analysis for measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our continued growth.\nAcquisition-related items consist of (i) fair value adjustments to contingent consideration and other contingent liabilities resulting from acquisitions, (ii) due diligence, integration, legal fees and other transaction costs associated with our acquisition program and (iii) acquisition accounting charges for the amortization of the initial fair value adjustments of acquired inventory and deferred revenue. The adjustments of contingent consideration and other contingent liabilities are periodic adjustments to record such amounts at fair value at each balance sheet date. Given the subjective nature of the assumptions used in the determination of fair value calculations, fair value adjustments may potentially cause significant earnings volatility that are not representative of our operating results. Similarly, due diligence, integration, legal and other acquisition costs associated with our acquisition program, including acquisition accounting charges relating to recording acquired inventory and deferred revenue at fair market value, can be significant and also adversely impact our effective tax rate as certain costs are often not tax-deductible. Since these acquisition-related items are irregular and often mask underlying operating performance, we exclude these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to past operating performance.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted wide-ranging tax legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"2017 Tax Act\"). The 2017 Tax Act significantly revises U.S. tax law by, among other provisions, (a) lowering the applicable U.S. federal statutory income tax rate from 35% to 21%, (b) creating a partial territorial tax system that includes imposing a mandatory one-time transition tax on previously deferred foreign earnings, (c) creating provisions regarding the (1) Global Intangible Low Tax Income, (2) the Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction, and (3) the Base Erosion Anti-Abuse Tax, and (d) eliminating or reducing certain income tax deductions, such as interest expense, executive compensation expenses and certain employee expenses. During the three months ended January 31, 2018, the Company recorded a one-time net benefit as a provisional estimate of the net accounting impact of the 2017 Tax Act in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. The net benefit is comprised of the following: (i) unfavorable impact related to the mandatory transition tax for deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and (ii) a favorable benefit related to a revaluation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities. Since these net favorable tax benefits are largely unrelated to our results and unrepresentative of our normal effective tax rate, we excluded its impact on net income and diluted EPS to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures.\nExcess tax benefits resulting from stock compensation are recorded as a reduction of income tax expense. The magnitude of the impact of excess tax benefits generated in the future, which may be favorable or unfavorable, are dependent upon our future grants of equity awards, our future share price on the date awards vest in relation to the fair value of awards on grant date and the exercise behavior of our stock option holders. Since these tax benefits are largely unrelated to our results and unrepresentative of our normal effective tax rate, we excluded their impact on net income and diluted EPS to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures. For the three months ended January 31, 2018 and as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, the Company revised its estimated annual effective rate to reflect the change in the U.S. federal statutory rate applicable to stock compensation. The reduction in the federal rate applicable to the gains and corollary deferred tax asset resulted in a decrease in the excess tax benefit reported for the three months ended October 31, 2017.\nIn fiscal 2016, we announced the retirement plans of our former Chief Executive Officer and recorded the majority of the costs associated with his retirement in our consolidated financial statements. Since these costs are irregular and mask our underlying operating performance, we made an adjustment to our net income and diluted EPS to exclude such costs to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures.\nThree Months Ended January 31, 2018\nWe made adjustments to net income and diluted EPS to exclude (i) amortization expense of purchased intangible assets, (ii) acquisition-related items, (iii) other business optimization and restructuring-related charges, (iv) net tax benefits associated with the estimated impact of the revaluation of our U.S. net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the 2017 Tax Act and the unfavorable impact of a repatriation tax and (v) excess tax benefits related to the change in the U.S. federal statutory rate applicable to stock compensation to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS.\nThree Months Ended January 31, 2017\nWe made adjustments to net income and diluted EPS to exclude (i) amortization expense of purchased intangible assets and (ii) other business optimization and restructuring-related charges to arrive at our non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS.\nThe reconciliations of net income and diluted EPS to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS were calculated as follows:\nThree Months Ended January 31,\n2018\n2017\nNet income/Diluted EPS, as reported\n$\n32,488\n$\n0.78\n$\n18,070\n$\n0.43\nIntangible amortization, net of tax (1)\n3,507\n0.08\n2,839\n0.07\nAcquisition-related items, net of tax (2)\n575\n0.01\n—\n—\nRestructuring-related charges, net of tax (3)\n1,267\n0.03\n642\n0.02\nExcess tax benefit reduction (4)\n274\n0.01\n—\n—\nTax legislative changes (5)\n(8,398)\n(0.20)\n—\n—\nNon-GAAP net income/Non-GAAP diluted EPS\n$\n29,713\n$\n0.71\n$\n21,551\n$\n0.52\n(1)\nAmounts were recorded in general and administrative expenses.\n(2)\nFor the three months ended January 31, 2018, pre-tax acquisition-related items of $540 were recorded in general and administrative expenses.\n(3)\nFor the three months ended January 31, 2018, pre-tax restructuring-related items of $642 were recorded in cost of sales and $748 were recorded in general and administrative expenses.

For the six months ended January 31, 2017, pre-tax acquisition-related items of $170 were recorded in cost of sales and $905 were recorded in general and administrative expenses.\n(3)\nFor the six months ended January 31, 2018, pre-tax restructuring-related items of $1,147 were recorded in cost of sales and $1,191 were recorded in general and administrative expenses. For the six months ended January 31, 2017, pre-tax restructuring-related items of $856 were recorded in general and administrative expenses.\n(4)\nAmounts were recorded in income taxes.\n(5)\nAmounts were recorded in other income.\n(dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data or as otherwise specified)\nTax Reform\nThe 2017 Tax Act, among other things, lowers the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from the previous maximum rate of 35%. We are required to recognize the impact of the tax law changes in the period when the law was enacted, including the re-measurement of deferred income tax assets and liabilities. We have recorded the impact in the second quarter based on available information. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate decreased to approximately 21% in the quarter. The net benefit is comprised of the favorable one-time benefit related to a revaluation our net deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by the unfavorable impact related to the mandatory transition tax for deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income. The following table shows Pro Forma non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS assuming a 35% U.S. federal income tax rate that applied prior to the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act.\nThis table is intended solely to provide comparability to prior periods and is not intended to be a substitute for net income or diluted EPS determined in accordance with GAAP using currently applicable tax rates.\nThree Months Ended\nSix Months Ended\nJanuary 31,\nJanuary 31,\n(Unaudited)\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nIncome before income taxes, as reported\n$\n31,347\n$\n27,487\n$\n62,930\n$\n53,457\nNon-GAAP adjustments (1)\n6,327\n4,913\n12,026\n11,834\nNon-GAAP income before taxes\n$\n37,674\n$\n32,400\n$\n74,956\n$\n65,291\nPro Forma effective income tax rate (2)\n34.4\n%\n33.5\n%\n35.0\n%\n34.4\n%\nPro Forma income tax provision (2)\n$\n12,960\n$\n10,860\n26,212\n22,427\nPro Forma non-GAAP net income\n$\n24,714\n$\n21,540\n$\n48,744\n$\n42,864\nPro Forma non-GAAP diluted EPS\n$\n0.59\n$\n0.52\n$\n1.17\n$\n1.03\n(1)\nThese non-GAAP adjustments are the pre-tax amounts found in the reconciliations of net income and diluted EPS to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS above.\n(2)\nPro Forma effective income tax rate assumes a 35% U.S. federal corporate income tax rate.\n(dollar amounts in thousands except share and per share data or as otherwise specified)\nReconciliation of Net Income to EBITDAS and Adjusted EBITDAS\nWe believe EBITDAS is an important valuation measurement for management and investors given the increasing effect that non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, amortization related to acquisitions and depreciation of capital equipment have on net income. In particular, acquisitions have historically resulted in significant increases in amortization of purchased intangible assets that reduce net income. Additionally, we regard EBITDAS as a useful measure of operating performance and cash flow before the effect of interest expense and is a complement to operating income, net income and other GAAP financial performance measures.\nWe define adjusted EBITDAS as EBITDAS excluding the same non-GAAP adjustments to net income discussed above. We use adjusted EBITDAS when evaluating operating performance because we believe the exclusion of such adjustments, of which a significant portion are non-cash items, is necessary to provide the most accurate measure of on-going core operating results and to evaluate comparative results period over period.\nThe reconciliations of net income to EBITDAS and adjusted EBITDAS were calculated as follows:\nThree Months Ended January 31,\nSix Months Ended January 31,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nNet income, as reported\n$\n32,488\n$\n18,070\n$\n55,417\n$\n36,870\nInterest expense, net\n1,135\n1,126\n2,324\n2,219\nIncome taxes\n(1,141)\n9,417\n7,513\n16,587\nDepreciation\n4,154\n3,694\n8,190\n7,148\nAmortization\n4,364\n4,057\n8,412\n7,966\nLoss on disposal of fixed assets\n265\n178\n334\n402\nStock-based compensation expense\n2,739\n2,116\n4,590\n5,038\nEBITDAS\n44,004\n38,658\n86,780\n76,230\nAcquisition-related items\n540\n—\n2,349\n1,075\nCEO retirement costs (1)\n—\n—\n—\n1,413\nRestructuring related charges\n1,390\n856\n2,338\n856\nResolution of Jet Prep contingent liability\n—\n—\n(1,138)\n—\nAdjusted EBITDAS\n$\n45,934\n$\n39,514\n$\n90,329\n$\n79,574",
