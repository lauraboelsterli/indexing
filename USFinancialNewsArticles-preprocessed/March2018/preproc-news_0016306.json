Children who have been abandoned or orphaned by war beg for more food at the Don Bosco center in Goma in eastern Congo, November 20, 2008. REUTERS/Finbarr O'Reilly/Files U.N. humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock will meet donors next week in the country where conditions in many areas are worsening, U.N. spokesman Jens Laerke told a Geneva briefing. “We have a great responsibility in the DRC...now is the time to stay the course,” Laerke said. The 2 million children at risk of starvation include some 300,000 children in the Kasai region, Bettina Luescher of the U.N.’s World Food Programme (WFP) said.
