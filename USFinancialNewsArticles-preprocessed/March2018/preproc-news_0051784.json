    "text": "VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian property group CA Immo ( CAIV.VI ) needs to see a concrete offer from Starwood before it can say whether it makes sense and if the price is fair, its finance chief said on Tuesday.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Austrian property goup CA Immo is pictured during a news conference in Vienna, Austria, March 22, 2016. REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader/File Photo The U.S. private equity firm offered to acquire a quarter of CA Immo and a smaller stake in its rival Immofinanz ( IMFI.VI ) last week, shortly after the latter called off a planned merger of the two.\n“In addition to the price, you need to take into account what Starwood’s plans are, (and) which strategic direction the offer includes,” Hans Volkert Volckens told a news conference in Vienna.\nAsked whether a merger of CA Immo, Immofinanz and S Immo ( SIAG.VI ) - Austria’s three big commercial property companies - would make sense, Volckens said: “Any form of consolidation in the commercial real estate sector makes sense from my perspective.”\nReporting by Kirsti Knolle; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
