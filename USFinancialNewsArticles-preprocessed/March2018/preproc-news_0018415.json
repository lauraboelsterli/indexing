    "text": "DENVER, March 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE: CMG) today announced that the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has made certain equity awards to new chief executive officer Brian Niccol, effective March 5, 2018. The awards were made pursuant to the company's previously-announced agreement with Niccol, and as a material inducement to his joining Chipotle as CEO and a member of the Board.\nThe awards made to Niccol are as follows: (i) a sign-on award consisting of stock-only stock appreciation rights, or SOSARs, in respect of 53,086 shares having an exercise price of $400.20 (125% of the closing price of Chipotle's common stock on the grant date) per share and a seven-year term, which SOSARs will vest in equal amounts on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date, subject to possible acceleration of vesting in the event of a termination of employment by Chipotle without cause or by Niccol with good reason; and (ii) make-whole awards consisting of (A) SOSARs in respect of 114,840 shares having an exercise price of $352.18 (110% of the closing price of Chipotle's common stock on the grant date) and a seven-year term, which will vest in equal amounts on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date, subject to possible acceleration of vesting as previously described; and (B) restricted stock units in respect of 30,141 shares of common stock, which will vest in equal amounts on the first, second and third anniversaries of the grant date, subject to possible acceleration of vesting as previously described.\nThe SOSARs and restricted stock units were all granted outside of the Amended and Restated Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (but will generally have terms and conditions consistent with those set forth in that plan), and were approved by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors in reliance on the employment inducement exemption under the NYSE's Listed Company Manual Rule 303A.08, which requires public announcement of inducement awards. Pursuant to the requirements of that rule, Chipotle is issuing this press release.\nABOUT CHIPOTLE\nSteve Ells, founder and executive chairman, started Chipotle with the idea that food served fast did not have to be a typical fast food experience. Today, Chipotle continues to offer a focused menu of burritos, tacos, burrito bowls, and salads made from fresh, high-quality raw ingredients, prepared using classic cooking methods and served in an interactive style allowing people to get exactly what they want. Chipotle seeks out extraordinary ingredients that are not only fresh, but that are raised responsibly, with respect for the animals, land, and people who produce them. Chipotle prepares its food using real, wholesome ingredients, without the use of added colors, flavors or other additives typically found in fast food. Chipotle opened with a single restaurant in Denver in 1993 and now operates more than 2,400 restaurants.
