Over the past three years, we have shifted our asset base to higher EBITDA margin products, causing our EBITDA to more than double from $16.2 million in 2015 to $40.2 million in 2017. We continue to grow our asset base both organically and through strategic acquisitions. Our AUM currently stands at approximately $11.5 billion, 90% of which is concentrated in precious metal and natural resource investments.\"\n\"Our focus this year is driving profitable growth in each of our operating segments while selectively evaluating opportunities to cement our leadership position as global leaders in precious metal investments through complementary acquisitions and strategic partnerships,\" added Mr. Grosskopf.\nAssets Under Management\n$ (in millions) AUM\nDecember 31,\n2016 Net Sales /\n(Redemptions) Net Market\nValue Change Transfers /\nAcquisitions /\n(Divestitures) AUM\nDecember 31,\n2017 Exchange Listed Products 4,412 50 172 — 4,634 Alternative Asset Management: Mutual Funds (1) 2,465 (235 ) (109 ) (1,231 ) 890 Alternative Investment Funds (2) 1,085 54 18 (980 ) 177 Managed Accounts 104 (42 ) (1 ) (13 ) 48 Private Resource Investments: Private Resource Lending Funds 49 193 10 — 252 Fixed-term limited partnerships 343 — (35 ) — 308 Managed Companies 653 32 22 — 707 Managed Accounts 137 — 26 144 307 Total Enterprise AUM 9,248 52 103 (2,080 ) 7,323 (1) As part of the Sale Transaction, the Company sold $1.9 billion of Mutual fund AUM and concurrent with this began sub-advising $0.7 billion of those same assets effective August 1, 2017\n(2) As part of the Sale Transaction, the Company sold $0.9 billion of Alternative fund AUM and concurrent with this began sub-advising $0.1 billion of those same assets effective August 1, 2017\nDividends\nOn March 1, 2018, a dividend of $0.03 per common share was declared for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nSprott Adopts Advance Notice By-Law Amendment\nOn March 2, 2018 Sprott's board of directors (the “Board”) adopted amendments to its By-Law No. 1 (the “Amendments”) to include advance notice provisions (the “Advance Notice Provisions”) requiring that advance notice be provided to the Company in circumstances where nominations of persons for election to the Board are made by shareholders other than pursuant to: (i) a requisition to call a shareholders meeting; or (ii) a shareholder proposal, in each case as made in accordance with the provisions of the Business Corporations Act (Ontario) (the “Act”).\nAmong other things, the Advance Notice Provisions fix a deadline by which shareholders must notify the Company of nominations of persons for election to the Board and set forth the information that a shareholder must include in the notice for it to be valid.\nIn the case of an annual meeting of shareholders, notice to the Company must be made not less than 30 days prior to the date of the annual meeting; provided however, that in the event that the annual meeting is to be held on a date that is less than 50 days after the date on which the first public announcement of the date of the annual meeting was made, notice may be made not later than the close of business on the 10th day following such public announcement. In the case of a special meeting of shareholders (which is not also an annual meeting) notice to the Company must be made no later than the close of business on the 15th day following the day on which the first public announcement of the date of the special meeting was made. However, if “notice and access” is used for the delivery of proxy-related materials for an annual general or special meeting and the initial public announcement is not less than 50 days before the date of the meeting, notice must be made not less than 40 days prior to the date of the meeting. The Board may, in its discretion, waive any requirement of the Advance Notice Provisions.\nThe Advance Notice Provisions provide a clear process for shareholders to follow to nominate directors and set out a reasonable time frame for nominee submissions along with a requirement for accompanying information. The purpose of the Advance Notice Provisions is to treat all shareholders fairly by ensuring that all shareholders, including those participating in a meeting by proxy rather than in person, receive adequate notice of the nominations to be considered at a meeting and can thereby exercise their voting rights in an informed manner. In addition, the Advance Notice Provisions should assist in facilitating an orderly and efficient meeting process.\nThe Amendments are effective immediately. In accordance with the provisions of the Act, the Amendments will be subject to confirmation by shareholders at the annual and special meeting of shareholders of the Company, which will be held on May 11, 2018.\nA copy of the Amendments have been filed under the Company’s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nConference Call and Webcast\nA conference call and webcast will be held today, March 2, 2018 at 10:00 am ET to discuss the Company's financial results. To participate in the call, please dial (855) 458-4215 ten minutes prior to the scheduled start of the call and provide conference ID 2197549.
