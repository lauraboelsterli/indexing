Senators approved the bill, which would limit the strictest rules to just a handful of the nationâ€™s largest banks while easing several rules for smaller lenders, by a vote of 67 to 31. The bill now heads to the U.S. House of Representatives, which must pass it before it can signed into law. Reporting by Pete Schroeder; Editing by Sandra Maler",
