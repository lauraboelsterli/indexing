    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas, March 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- SpareFoot , the world's largest online self-storage marketplace, has agreed to acquire SiteLink , a leading provider of cloud-based software solutions for the self-storage industry. The deal will bring together two dynamic companies and allow the combined business to accelerate investment, drive innovation and generate value for both consumers and facility operators in the $38 billion self-storage industry.\nCove Hill Partners, a private equity firm based in Boston, will acquire a majority stake in both businesses. SpareFoot CEO Chuck Gordon will become CEO of the combined company, and Ross Lampe will remain President of SiteLink with his team continuing to serve self-storage customers. The transactions are expected to close in the next 30 days, subject to customary closing conditions.\nThe combined company will draw upon a strong team of experienced and talented employees, existing product integration and established personal relationships between the two businesses, and a shared mission to serve self-storage operators and consumers with a best-in-class experience.\n\"We're excited to combine two of the most respected and successful technology companies in self-storage,\" said Chuck Gordon, CEO of SpareFoot. \"This deal and partnership with Cove Hill allows us to increase investment in our products to help self-storage operators run their businesses cost-effectively and help consumers find the perfect storage solution.\"\n\"We have a unique opportunity to deepen our existing product integration and accelerate innovation,\" said Markus Hecker, COO of SiteLink. \"We remain committed to delivering value and will use our combined resources to help our customers grow their businesses.\"\nThe strategic partnership will enable SpareFoot to find and deliver more tenants to facilities on its network and will accelerate technology investments at SiteLink; this includes myHub development, SiteLink Merchant Services and SiteLink Web Edition, its flagship product.\nWilliam Blair served as exclusive financial advisor to SpareFoot.\nAbout SiteLink\nSiteLink is a global leader in self-storage management software and in-house payment processing.
