    "text": "HOUSTON, alliantgroup is proud to announce the addition of Tom Ridge to the firm's Strategic Advisory Board as Chairman of Cybersecurity and Technology. Serving as the nation's first Secretary of Homeland Security from 2003 to 2005 and as the former Governor of Pennsylvania, Gov. Ridge brings to the firm his wealth of experience as a public servant and his extensive expertise on a range of policy issues such as cybersecurity, technology, education and economic development.\nAs alliantgroup's new Chairman of Cybersecurity and Technology, Gov. Ridge will leverage his knowledge of cybersecurity issues for the benefit of tech-based clients as well as help to guide the firm's outreach on the various tax credits and incentives available for the benefit of cybersecurity and technology companies.\n\"From his time with the Department of Homeland Security to his current work in the private sector with Ridge Global, Tom has established himself as a true thought leader in the area of cybersecurity,\" said former U.S. Congressman and alliantgroup Senior Vice President Rick Lazio . \"I have been friends with Tom for many years, I have witnessed his passion for cybersecurity and technology and I have long known him to be a champion for U.S. businesses and economic progress. I have no doubt he will bring a fresh perspective to our clients and improve our outreach to this vital industry.\"\nFrom his time in public service to his work later today in the private sector, Gov. Ridge has been responsible for managing large agencies and has demonstrated excellent leadership with respect to issues of security. In response to the tragic events of September 11, 2001, Ridge was appointed by then-President George W. Bush as the nation's first Secretary of Homeland Security. During his tenure, Ridge worked with more than 180,000 employees to form a department that was responsible for strengthening border security, providing intelligence analysis and infrastructure protection, improving the use of technology to counter weapons of mass destruction, integrating new technology and improving information sharing worldwide, and creating a comprehensive response and recovery division.\nToday, Ridge is the founder and Chairman of Ridge Global, LLC, a Washington, D.C., based security consulting firm that provides its clients with solutions to cybersecurity, international security and risk management issues. Since re-entering the private sector, Ridge has also served on several public and private boards.\nPrior to his time in the Bush administration, Ridge served as the Governor of Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2001 where his aggressive technology strategy fueled the state's economic development.\n\"It gives me great pride to announce that Governor Ridge has joined our team,\" said alliantgroup CEO Dhaval Jadav . \"His background in cybersecurity solutions in both the public and private sectors will only enhance our understanding of these industries as we continue to expand our practice.\"\nalliantgroup is a leading tax consultancy and the nation's premier provider of specialty tax services. The firm assists businesses and their CPA advisors in properly identifying and claiming all federal and state tax incentives that were designed for their benefit.
