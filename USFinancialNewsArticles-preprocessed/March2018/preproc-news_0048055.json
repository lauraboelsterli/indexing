A Tesla Model S electric car is seen at its dealership in Seoul, South Korea July 6, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo \nTesla said there were no accidents or injuries related to the issue and the recall was undertaken in an abundance of caution. \nThe bolts, made by German supplier Bosch, can begin to corrode after contact in cold temperatures with road salt. Some Tesla owners had complained about the issue on online forums. \nSome 123,000 Model S vehicles globally contain the bolts, Tesla said. Related Coverage Tesla shares recover as company pushes to hit Model 3 target \n“We have observed excessive corrosion in the power steering bolts, though only in very cold climates, particularly those that frequently use calcium or magnesium road salts, rather than sodium chloride (table salt),” Tesla wrote in an email to customers. \nWere the bolts to fail, the driver would still able to steer the car but would need to use more force “due to loss or reduction of power assist,” Tesla wrote. \nA retrofit in Tesla service centres should take about an hour, Tesla said.
