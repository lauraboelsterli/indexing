    "text": "By Natasha Bach 12:16 PM EST \nHe might have more than two-and-a-half years until his name is on a presidential ballot again , but things are not looking great for President Trump’s reelection. \nAccording to a new Politico /Morning Consult poll , Trump is trailing by eight points—behind a generic Democrat. \nThe poll showed Trump behind, receiving 36% support as compared to 44% for the yet-to-be-named Democratic candidate. Nevertheless, 19% of voters polled remain undecided who they will vote for come 2020. \nWhile the results fell predominantly along party lines, Republican support for Trump is falling. The poll found that 80% of those who voted for Trump in 2016 would vote for him again, compared to 86% of Hillary supporters who would vote for the Democratic candidate in 2020. The Independents polled leaned somewhat Democrat, with 35% support, while 29% said they would vote for Trump and 36% were undecided. \nTrump’s approval rating has dropped consistently since entering office. It’s currently at 43% . With a revolving door for his staff capped off most recently with the resignation of Gary Cohn , Trump’s future is precarious at best. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
