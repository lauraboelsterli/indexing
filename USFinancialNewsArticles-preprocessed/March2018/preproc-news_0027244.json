    "text": "RALEIGH, N.C., March 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ANEXIO, a leading provider of high-performance computing infrastructure, is pleased to announce that it has acquired Standard American Mining (SAM), a successful stealth mode startup and builder of high-density Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) facilities. The deal positions ANEXIO to become the global leader in high-performance computing infrastructure.\nTomorrow's computing infrastructure will require a strategic blend of GPUs and Central Processing Units (CPU) operating in high-performance data centers. ANEXIO's combined infrastructure will create a valuable platform to support complex computing requirements for emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, self-driving cars, 3D rendering and DNA sequencing.\nThis transaction enables ANEXIO to expand their high-performance computing production while also accelerating Standard American Mining's goal of building the largest GPU infrastructure in the United States. The acquisition includes the following assets of Standard American Mining:\nExisting GPU infrastructure Proven systems architecture Proprietary hardware design A strong team with deep GPU expertise\n\"This acquisition is the culmination of a profitable partnership with the Standard American Mining team,\" said Tony Pompliano, ANEXIO President and CEO. \"The addition of Standard American Mining to ANEXIO complements and enhances our world-class computing infrastructure by adding a number of proprietary systems, along with a highly competent team. We're excited to acquire immediate GPU expertise that easily plugs into our existing, geographically diverse infrastructure. SAM's team and facilities will help us achieve our growth goals even faster as we begin to offer increasingly valuable infrastructure to our customers.\"\nStandard American Mining's co-founder is Tony Pompliano's son, Anthony Pompliano, who is also a managing partner of Full Tilt Capital, the sole investor for Standard American Mining. In the year since starting the company, Anthony and his team have turned it into a GPU market leader and innovator. Joining forces with ANEXIO straight out of stealth mode is just another step in its success story. As part of the acquisition, Anthony will be joining ANEXIO's Board of Directors as Chairman.\n\"A year ago, the team at Standard American Mining began based on a single thesis: The world will quickly transition from being CPU-dependent to GPU-dependent,\" said Jason Williams, Partner of Full Tilt Capital. \"This transaction allows Standard American Mining to accelerate our progress by providing access to larger pools of capital and headcount. We're essentially going from high school straight to the pros.\"\nABOUT ANEXIO\nANEXIO is transforming the IT industry by building high-performance technology infrastructure to serve the complex computing needs of the world's most innovative companies. The Inc. 500 company provides this mission-critical infrastructure across eight Tier III SOC-2 certified data centers, an IT solutions center, and a nationwide IP Network. ANEXIO's revenues have grown over 1,400 percent since 2013 and continue to accelerate as the company builds new infrastructure for emerging technologies.
