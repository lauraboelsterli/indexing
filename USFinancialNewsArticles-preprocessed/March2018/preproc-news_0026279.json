    "text": "TORONTO, March 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Datametrex AI Limited (the “ Company ” or “ Datametrex ”) (TSXV:DM) (FSE:D4G) would like to provide shareholders with an update on the proposed acquisition of Shoptalk Analytics Group Inc. (“ Shoptalk ”) announced on January 8, 2018. After careful analysis of the opportunity, the Datametrex management team has decided not to proceed with the proposed acquisition. Datametrex and Shoptalk are in discussions to establish a licensing agreement that would allow Datametrex the opportunity to sell the products once Shoptalk’s units are fully commercialized.\n“We see a great opportunity to work with Shoptalk on a licensing agreement platform as they move to full commercialization.
