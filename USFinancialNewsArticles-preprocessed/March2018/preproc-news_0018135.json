Aquino, President and CEO. \"We are optimistic in 2018 given our growing sales pipeline, recent wins, and SingleHop integration opportunities that will drive top line growth. We continue to optimize our real estate portfolio, and see upside in continued cost savings throughout the year. In addition, we recently amended our credit facility adding flexibility post our all debt deal to acquire SingleHop, alleviating any immediate need to raise additional capital. Looking ahead, we will be opportunistic in corporate development to search out accretive deals, and consider non-core asset sales or exits, that increase value for our shareholders.”\nRevenue\n● Revenue totaled $70.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 1.6% sequentially, and a decrease of 5.5% year over year. The sequential increase is a milestone that reverses the previous declining trend. Year over year, approximately $1.2 million of the decline is from the proactive closure of the 75 Broad Street, New York facility, which improves profitability. Excluding this event, the year over year revenue decline was reduced to 3.9%. In addition, year over year declines were partially offset by approximately $1.9 million in revenue from the consolidation of INAP Japan, and $1.3 million from the acquisition of a new data center in Atlanta with an anchor tenant.\n● INAP COLO revenue totaled $52.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 2.9% sequentially, and a decrease of 3.9% year over year. Approximately $1.0 million of the year over year decline was attributed to the planned closure of the 75 Broad Street, New York facility. Excluding this event, the year over year revenue decline was reduced to approximately 2.0%. The declines were partially offset from the consolidation of INAP Japan, and the Atlanta data center mentioned above.\n● INAP CLOUD revenue totaled $17.2 million in the fourth quarter, and a decrease of 2.2% sequentially, and a decrease of 10.3% year over year. Approximately $0.2 million of the year over year decline was attributed to the planned closure of the 75 Broad Street, New York facility.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Summary\n($ in thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nQoQ YoY 4Q 2017 3Q 2017 4Q 2016 Growth Growth Total Revenue $ 70,035 $ 68,907 $ 74,117 1.6% (5.5%) Operating Costs and Expenses $ 64,432 $ 68,175 $ 79,115 (5.5%) (18.6%) Depreciation and Amortization $ 17,397 $ 20,917 $ 19,021 (16.8%) (8.5%) Exit Activities, Restructuring and Impairments $ (148) $ 745 $ 7,149 - - All Other Operating Costs and Expenses $ 47,183 $ 46,513 $ 52,945 1.4% (10.9%) GAAP Net Loss Attributable to INAP Shareholders $ (6,934) $ (10,895) $ (13,110) (36.4%) (47.1%) GAAP Net Loss Margin (9.9%) (15.8%) (17.7%) Minus Goodwill Impairment and Other Items $ 1,393 $ 757 $ 7,613 84.0% (81.7%) Normalized Net Loss 2 $ (5,541) $ (10,138) $ (5,497) (45.3%) 0.8% Adjusted EBITDA 1 $ 24,363 $ 23,277 $ 21,561 4.7% 13.0% Adjusted EBITDA Margin 1 34.8% 33.8% 29.1% Capital Expenditures (CapEx) $ 12,616 $ 10,965 $ 6,250 15.1% 101.9% Adjusted EBITDA less CapEx 1 $ 11,747 $ 12,312 $ 15,311 (4.6%) (23.3%)\nNet Loss, Normalized Net Loss, Adjusted EBITDA and Business Unit Contribution\n● GAAP net loss attributable to INAP shareholders was $(6.9) million, or $(0.35) per share in the fourth quarter of 2017, including $(0.1) million of costs associated with exit activities, restructuring and impairments, compared with $7.1 million, or $(1.01) per share in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $0.7 million, or $(1.75) per share in the third quarter of 2017.

These forward-looking statements include statements related to sales, improved profitability, margin expansion, operations improvement, cost reductions, participation in strategic transactions, our strategy to align into pure-play businesses and our expectations for full-year 2017 and 2018 revenue, Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditures. Our ability to achieve these forward-looking statements is based on certain assumptions, including our ability to execute on our business strategy, leveraging of multiple routes to market, expanded brand awareness for high-performance Internet infrastructure services and customer churn levels. These assumptions may prove inaccurate in the future. Because such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause INAP’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, due to a variety of important factors. Such important factors include, without limitation: our ability to execute on our business strategy into a pure-play business and drive growth while reducing costs; our ability to maintain current customers and obtain new ones, whether in a cost-effective manner or at all; the robustness of the IT infrastructure services market; our ability to achieve or sustain profitability; our ability to expand margins and drive higher returns on investment; our ability to sell into new and existing data center space; the actual performance of our IT infrastructure services and improving operations; our ability to correctly forecast capital needs, demand planning and space utilization; our ability to respond successfully to technological change and the resulting competition; the geographic concentration of the Company’s data centers in certain markets and any adverse developments in local economic conditions or the demand for data center space in these markets; ability to identify any suitable strategic transactions; ability to realize anticipated revenue, growth, synergies and cost savings from the acquisition of SingleHop; INAP's ability to successfully integrate SingleHop’s sales, operations, technology, and products generally; the availability of services from Internet network service providers or network service providers providing network access loops and local loops on favorable terms, or at all; failure of third party suppliers to deliver their products and services on favorable terms, or at all; failures in our network operations centers, data centers, network access points or computer systems; our ability to provide or improve Internet infrastructure services to our customers; our ability to protect our intellectual property; our substantial amount of indebtedness, our possibility to raise additional capital when needed, on attractive terms, or at all, our ability to service existing debt or maintain compliance with financial and other covenants contained in our credit agreement; our compliance with and changes in complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and internationally; our ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel; and volatility in the trading price of INAP common stock.\nThese risks and other important factors discussed under the caption “Risk Factors” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), and our other reports filed with the SEC could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward-looking statements made in this press release.\nGiven these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. All forward-looking statements attributable to INAP or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing forward-looking statements.

A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found below.\nWe define the following non-GAAP measures as follows:\n● Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and is GAAP net loss attributable to INAP shareholders plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, other expense (income), (gain) loss on disposal of property and equipment, exit activities, restructuring and impairments, stock-based compensation, non-income tax contingency, strategic alternatives and related costs, organizational realignment costs, pre-acquisition costs and claim settlement.\n● Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenues.\n● Adjusted EBITDA less CapEx is Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditures with Adjusted EBITDA for this non-GAAP measure defined as net cash flow provided by operating activities plus cash paid for interest, cash paid for taxes, cash paid for exit activities and restructuring, cash paid for strategic alternatives and related costs, cash paid for organizational realignment costs, payment of debt lender fees and other working capital changes less capital expenditures.\n● Normalized net loss is net loss attributable to INAP shareholders plus exit activities, restructuring and impairments, stock-based compensation, non-income tax contingency, strategic alternatives and related costs, organizational realignment costs, pre-acquisition costs, claim settlement and debt extinguishment and modification expenses.\n● Business unit contribution is business unit revenues less direct costs of sales and services, customer support, and sales and marketing, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\n● Business unit contribution margin is business unit contribution as a percentage of business unit revenue.\n● Free cash flow is net cash flows provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures.\n● Unlevered free cash flow is free cash flow plus cash interest expense.\nWe believe that presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations.\nWe believe that excluding depreciation and amortization and loss (gain) on disposals of property and equipment, as well as impairments and restructuring, to calculate Adjusted EBITDA provides supplemental information and an alternative presentation that is useful to investors’ understanding of our current ongoing operating results and trends. Not only are depreciation and amortization expenses based on historical costs of assets that may have little bearing on present or future replacement costs, but also they are based on management estimates of remaining useful lives. Loss on disposals of property and equipment is also based on historical costs of assets that may have little bearing on replacement costs. Impairments and restructuring expenses primarily reflect goodwill impairments and subsequent plan adjustments in sublease income assumptions for certain properties included in our previously disclosed restructuring plans.\nWe believe that excluding interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes and other expense (income) from non-GAAP financial measures provides supplemental information and an alternative presentation useful to investors’ understanding of our core operating results and trends. Investors have indicated that they consider financial measures of our results of operations excluding interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes and other expense (income) as important supplemental information useful to their understanding of our historical results and estimating our future results.\nINTERNAP CORPORATION\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (Continued)\nWe also believe that, in excluding the effects of interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes and other expense (income), our non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with transparency into what management uses to measure and forecast our results of operations, to compare on a consistent basis our results of operations for the current period to that of prior periods and to compare our results of operations on a more consistent basis against that of other companies, in making financial and operating decisions and to establish certain management compensation.\nWe believe that exit activities, restructuring and impairment charges, non-income tax contingency, strategic alternatives and related costs, organizational realignment costs, pre-acquisition costs, claim settlement costs and debt extinguishment and modification expense are unique costs, and consequently, we do not consider these charges as a normal component of expenses related to current and ongoing operations.\nSimilarly, we believe that excluding the effects of stock-based compensation from non-GAAP financial measures provides supplemental information and an alternative presentation useful to investors’ understanding of our current ongoing operating results and trends. Management believes that investors consider financial measures of our results of operations excluding stock-based compensation as important supplemental information useful to their understanding of our historical results and estimating our future results.\nWe also believe that, in excluding the effects of stock-based compensation, our non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with transparency into what management uses to measure and forecast our results of operations, to compare on a consistent basis our results of operations for the current period to that of prior periods and to compare our results of operations on a more consistent basis against that of other companies, in making financial and operating decisions and to establish certain management compensation.\nStock-based compensation is an important part of total compensation, especially from the perspective of employees. We believe, however, that supplementing GAAP net loss by providing normalized net loss, excluding the effect of exit activities, restructuring and impairments, stock-based compensation, non-income tax contingency, strategic alternatives and related costs, organizational realignment cost, pre-acquisition costs, claim settlement costs, and debt extinguishment and modification expenses in all periods, is useful to investors because it enables additional and more meaningful period-to-period comparisons.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, and should be viewed as a supplement to — not a substitute for — our results of operations presented on the basis of GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA does not purport to represent cash flow provided by operating activities as defined by GAAP. Our statements of cash flows present our cash flow activity in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA is used by and is useful to investors and other users of our financial statements in evaluating our operating performance because it provides them with an additional tool to compare business performance across companies and across periods. We believe that:\n● EBITDA is widely used by investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, which can vary substantially from company-to-company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired; and\n● investors commonly adjust EBITDA information to eliminate the effect of disposals of property and equipment, impairments, restructuring and stock-based compensation which vary widely from company-to-company and impair comparability.\nOur management uses Adjusted EBITDA:\n● as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period-to-period on a consistent basis;\n● as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations; and\n● in communications with the board of directors, analysts and investors concerning our financial performance.\nOur presentation of business unit contribution and business unit contribution margin excludes depreciation and amortization in order to allow investors to see the business through the eyes of management.\nWe also have excluded depreciation and amortization from business unit contribution and business unit contribution margin because, as noted above, they are based on estimated useful lives of tangible and intangible assets. Further, depreciation and amortization are based on historical costs incurred to build out our deployed network and the historical costs of these assets may not be indicative of current or future capital expenditures.\nFree cash flow and unlevered free cash flow are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow and unlevered free cash flow should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow and unlevered free cash flow reflect an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.\nWe use free cash flow and unlevered free cash flow, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a useful measure of cash flows since capital expenditures are a necessary component of ongoing operations. In limited circumstances in which proceeds from sales of fixed assets exceed capital expenditures, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since we do not anticipate being a net seller of fixed assets, we expect free cash flow to be less than operating cash flows.\nFree cash flow and unlevered free cash flow have limitations due to the fact that they do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made to service our debt or capital lease obligations. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.\nAdjusted EBITDA less CapEx is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA less CapEx should not be relied upon to the exclusion of GAAP financial measures. Adjusted EBITDA less CapEx reflects an additional way of viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and to not rely on any single financial measure.\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA less CapEx, and ratios based on it, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a useful measure of cash flows since capital expenditures are a necessary component of ongoing operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA less CapEx has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA less CapEx does not incorporate payments made to service our debt or capital lease obligations. Therefore, we believe it is important to view Adjusted EBITDA less CapEx as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of cash flows.\nAdjusted EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is presented as we understand certain investors use it as one measure of our historical ability to service debt. Also adjusted EBITDA is used in our debt covenants.\nAlthough we believe, for the foregoing reasons, that our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our results of operations, our non-GAAP financial measures should only be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, any measure of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nINTERNAP CORPORATION\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (Continued)\nUse of non-GAAP financial measures is subject to inherent limitations because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under GAAP and because they involve the exercise of judgment of which charges should properly be excluded from the non-GAAP financial measure. Management accounts for these limitations by not relying exclusively on non-GAAP financial measures, but only using such information to supplement GAAP financial measures. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same non-GAAP measures, and may not be calculated in the same manner, as those used by other companies.\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP NET LOSS TO ADJUSTED EBITDA AND FORWARD LOOKING ADJUSTED EBITDA\nA reconciliation of GAAP net loss attributable to INAP shareholders to forward looking Adjusted EBITDA for full-year 2018 is as follows (in millions):\n2018 Full-Year Guidance Low High Amount Percent Amount Percent Total Revenue $ 320 100.0 % $ 330 100.0 % Net Loss (GAAP) attributable to INAP shareholders $ (48 ) (15.0 )% $ (38 ) (11.5 )% Add: Depreciation and amortization 70 21.9 % 70 21.2 % Interest expense 59 18.4 % 59 17.9 % Provision for income taxes 1 0.2 % 1 0.2 % Exit activities, restructuring and impairments, including goodwill impairment 11 3.4 % 11 3.3 % Stock-based compensation 12 3.8 % 12 3.6 % Pre-acquisition costs 1 0.2 % 1 0.2 % Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) $ 105 32.8 % $ 115 34.8 % INTERNAP CORPORATION\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (Continued)\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP NET CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TO ADJUSTED EBITDA LESS CAPEX\nA reconciliation of GAAP Net Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities to Adjusted EBITDA less CapEx for each of the periods indicated is as follows (in thousands, unaudited):\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2017 Net Cash Flows provided by operating activities: $ 13,808 $ 3,306 $ 10,185 Add : Cash paid for interest 11,793 10,999 7,604 Cash paid for income taxes 176 (24) 22 Cash paid for exit activities and restructuring 1,450 2,887 1,229 Cash paid for strategic alternatives and related costs 373 171 512 Cash paid for orgainzational realignment costs 282 — 1,664 Other working capital changes (3,520) 5,938 345 Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) $ 24,363 $ 23,277 $ 21,561 Less: Capital Expenditures (CapEx) $ 12,616 $ 10,965 $ 6,250 Adjusted EBITDA less CapEx (non-GAAP) $ 11,747 $ 12,312 $ 15,311\nRECONCILIATION OF NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INAP SHAREHOLDERS TO NORMALIZED NET LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INAP SHAREHOLDERS\nReconciliations of net loss attributable to INAP shareholders, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to normalized net loss attributable to INAP shareholders (in thousands, unaudited):\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2017 Net loss (GAAP) Attributable to INAP Shareholders ($6,934) ($10,895) ($13,110) Exit activities, restructuring and impairments, including goodwill impairment (148) 745 7,149 Stock-based compensation 979 929 280 Strategic alternatives, realignment, and related costs 385 46 184 Pre-acquisition costs 176 102 — INAP Japan Fair Market Valuation — (1,065) — Normalized net loss attributable to INAP shareholders (non-GAAP) ($5,541) ($10,138) ($5,497)\nINTERNAP CORPORATION\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (Continued)\nBUSINESS UNIT CONTRIBUTION AND BUSINESS UNIT CONTRIBUTION MARGIN\nBusiness unit contribution and business unit contribution margin, which includes direct costs of sales and service, customer support and sales and marketing for each of the periods indicated is as follows (in thousands, unaudited):\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Revenues: INAP COLO 52,852 51,344 54,971 INAP CLOUD 17,183 17,563 19,146 Total 70,035 68,907 74,117 Direct costs of sales and services, customer support and sales and marketing: INAP COLO* 30,305 29,048 34,620 INAP CLOUD* 9,079 9,094 9,720 Total 39,384 38,142 44,340 Business Unit Contribution: INAP COLO 22,547 22,296 20,351 INAP CLOUD 8,104 8,469 9,426 Total 30,651 30,765 29,777 Business Unit Contribution Margin: INAP COLO 42.7% 43.4% 37.0% INAP CLOUD 47.2% 48.2% 49.2% Total 43.8% 44.6% 40.2% *Excludes facilities allocation\nFREE CASH FLOW AND UNLEVERED FREE CASH FLOW\nFree cash flow and unlevered free cash flow are non-GAAP measures.
