    "text": "Chris Whalen Named Vice President of Sales; Neil Cohen Appointed Vice President of Marketing\nBOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Edge Intelligence , developer of the first distributed analytics platform built for both hybrid cloud and edge computing environments, today announces that it has expanded its management team with the appointments of two senior executives. Chris Whalen has joined the business as vice president of sales. Neil Cohen has joined the organization as vice president of marketing. The company has also expanded its operations in the United States with the establishment of a new Boston corporate headquarters where the global go-to-market initiatives will be centered.\nEdge Intelligence offers a centrally managed, geographically distributed analytics platform with patented technology that optimizes performance for any type of data and query. The platform overcomes the silos and constraints associated with warehousing data by leaving data at its source and overcoming restrictions imposed by network bandwidth and latency, the costs of bulk shipping data and the sensitivity of data that cannot be moved due to privacy concerns or government regulations. According to IDC’s Worldwide Semiannual Big Data and Analytics Spending Guide , worldwide revenues for big data and business analytics will grow from $150.8 billion in 2017 to more than $210 billion in 2020.\nTo support the rapid growth expected in the big data and analytics market and to accelerate the company’s next phase of growth, Edge Intelligence has brought on board two highly experienced professionals to join the company’s leadership team. Chris Whalen brings extensive experience in technology sales and executive management and a solid track record of rapidly driving dramatic revenue growth for start-up companies to his role, where he will lead global sales for the organization. Previously, Whalen was vice president of sales for big data analytics solutions provider Deepfield Networks, where he built sales teams in North America and Europe and helped to propel revenue in one year by 260 percent with consistent growth thereafter, leading to the acquisition of Deepfield Networks by Nokia. Before Deepfield Networks/Nokia, Whalen was vice president of worldwide sales at Cariden Technologies, where he rebuilt Cariden’s sales team to increase revenue growth by 2.5 times, helping to prove the company’s business value to Cisco which then acquired the business. Prior to that, he held senior-level sales positions at several companies, including Packet Design, Inc. and ThePlatform – Reliacast, among others.\nNeil Cohen leverages his more than 15 years of combined marketing and product management experience to serve as Edge Intelligence’s new vice president of marketing, where he is responsible for the company’s global marketing strategy and execution. Before Edge Intelligence, he was vice president of global marketing at Akamai Technologies, where he set the overall marketing strategy and oversaw the implementation of worldwide digital and field campaigns for a $1.3 billion business unit which included the company’s cloud security and web performance product lines. Prior to that, Cohen was vice president of global product marketing at the company, where he helped the organization double revenue and repeatedly launched and marketed new products, growing them into businesses exceeding hundreds of millions of dollars. Before Akamai, he held senior-level marketing, product and engineering positions at Mindspeed Technologies, Conexant Systems and Digital Semiconductor, in addition to other companies.\n“To support digital transformation initiatives and accelerate growth in today’s highly competitive world, companies need instant access to their data anytime, anywhere,” said Kate Mitchell, co-founder and CEO of Edge Intelligence. “We are committed to solving the most difficult challenges at the cornerstone of big data, fog/edge computing, distributed machine learning, Internet of Things (IoT) and data warehousing. I am excited about hiring two highly seasoned, local executives to help Edge Intelligence meet the market demand for our solution. Chris and Neil both bring an extensive amount of experience to their respective roles, and I have already seen the positive impact they are having on the company.”\nIn addition to the growth of its leadership team, Edge Intelligence has also established its corporate headquarters in Boston. The company’s research and development center is located in Bristol, England.\nAbout Edge Intelligence\nEdge Intelligence has developed the industry’s first distributed analytics platform built for both hybrid cloud and edge computing environments. Enterprises and government entities are able to efficiently store, analyze and process all types of data across geographies without physically moving it.
