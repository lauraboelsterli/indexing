    "text": "The U.S. stock market is under pressure once again, with more than half the S&P 500 falling into correction territory.\nMore than 275 components in the broad index were down at least 10 percent from their 52-week highs as of 11:04 a.m. ET. Of those companies, 84 were in bear-market territory, or down at least 20 percent from their one-year high.\nGeneral Electric is the stock farthest from its 52-week high, trading more than 55 percent below that level. Newell Brands , Baker Hughes and Mattel also traded more than 50 percent below their highs. Other stocks in correction territory include Google parent Alphabet , Pepsico and Harley-Davidson .\nThe U.S. stock market came under pressure Thursday as a combination of trouble in the technology sector and concerns about a potential trade war rattled investors. Facebook shares added to this week's losses on Thursday, falling more than 1 percent. Meanwhile, investors awaited a White House announcement on Chinese tariffs. \nThe S&P 500 itself, which fell briefly into correction territory last month before recovering, is down 6.9 percent from its record high set earlier this year.\nThe chart below shows the S&P 500 stocks in correction territory:\nWATCH: S&P 500 around breakeven for March show chapters S&P 500 is around breakeven for March      2:50 PM ET Tue, 20 March 2018 | 04:28",
