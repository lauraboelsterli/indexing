(Nasdaq: CTXR), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on adjunctive cancer care and critical care drug products, today announced that it has entered into definitive agreements with several institutional and accredited investors for the purchase of 669,504 shares of its common stock, at a purchase price per share of $2.9850 for gross proceeds of approximately $2.0 million, in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market. Additionally, Citius has also agreed to issue to the investors unregistered warrants to purchase up to 669,504 shares of common stock. The closing of the offering is expected to take place on or about April 2, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nH.C.

The warrants described above were offered in a private placement under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Act\"), and Regulation D promulgated thereunder and, along with the shares of common stock underlying the warrants, have not been registered under the Act, or applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the warrants and underlying shares of common stock may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Act and such applicable state securities laws.\nA prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus relating to the offering will be filed with the SEC.
