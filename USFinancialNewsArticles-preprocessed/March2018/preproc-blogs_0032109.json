    "text": "Xi Jinping is re-elected as China’s president \nLintao Zhang | Pool | Getty Images \nChinese President Xi Jinping speaks at the Great Hall of the People on October 25, 2017 in Beijing, China. \nChina’s largely rubber-stamp parliament on Saturday unanimously re-elected Xi Jinping as the country’s president. \nThe vote was witnessed by journalists inside central Beijing’s Great Hall of the People. \nThe legislature is packed with delegates loyal to the ruling Communist Party meaning Xi’s re-election was never in doubt. On Sunday parliament voted to amend the constitution to removepresidential term limits, meaning Xi can stay indefinitely. ADVERTISEMENT",
