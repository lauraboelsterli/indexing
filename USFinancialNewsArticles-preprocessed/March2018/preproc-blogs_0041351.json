    "text": "A prolonged bull market has prompted some retirees to rely on one Social Security strategy: Claim benefits early and invest the money.\nBut use that strategy at your own risk.\nThough most prognosticators do not think recent volatility signals an end to the nine-year bull market, the wild swings are likely here to stay .\nAnd a full-on downturn is always a possibility.\n\"I don't know when or how large it will be, but there's always going to be a bear market and correction in the future,\" said Aaron E. Graham, a financial planner at Abacus Planning Group in Columbia, South Carolina.\n\"If you think you can do better than [8 percent], I think you should be a hedge fund manager.\" -Thomas Yorke, Oceanic Capital Management While you can claim Social Security retirement benefits starting from age 62, your benefits will be larger if you wait.\nYou receive 100 percent of your retirement benefit if you claim at full retirement age — 66 or 67 for most individuals, depending on when you were born.\nIf you claim earlier than your full retirement age, you will receive a reduced benefit.\nIf you wait past full retirement age , your benefit will grow by as much as 8 percent per year up to age 70.\nThat is one key reason financial advisors caution against taking Social Security early to invest in the market.\n\"The longer the time span is, the greater the chances you have to be wrong,\" Graham said.\nIt's hard to consistently beat an 8 percent return Consistently getting a return of 8 percent — the top rate by which your benefits can potentially increase if you wait to claim — will pose a challenge for any investor, said financial advisor Thomas H. Yorke, managing director at Oceanic Capital Management in Red Bank, New Jersey.\n\"If you think you can do better than that, I think you should be a hedge fund manager,\" Yorke said. \"Not only on a risk-adjusted basis you'll likely be way underperforming, but we're just humans and we're subject to all these biases.\"\nWhile you may be able to beat that 8 percent return a few years in a row, you could run into another year like 2008, Yorke said.\nAnd the closer that sharp downturn is to retirement, the harder it is to make up. If there's a 50 percent pullback in the market, for example, you may need a 100 percent return to get you back to where you need to be, Yorke said.\nTapping Social Security benefits early Age at claiming Reduction to benefit Monthly benefit after reduction for claiming early Change from delaying claiming by one year 62 30 percent $700 -- 63 25 percent $750 7.1 percent 64 20 percent $800 6.7 percent 65 13.3 percent $867 8.4 percent 66 6.7 percent $933 7.6 percent 67 (full retirement age if born after 1960) -- $1,000 7.2 percent Source: Pew Charitable Trusts Your spouse could get less money\nTaking Social Security retirement benefits at 62 only makes sense in a limited number of circumstances, such as if you are",
