For the full year 2017, we further strengthened our leading global position in terms of global market share by shipping 9,807MW of solar modules, a 47.3% increase from 2016. Our gross margin was 11.3% for the year, compared to 18.1% in 2016, partially as a result of increased collaboration with OEM partners to meet surging market demand, especially in the first half of 2017, and higher raw material costs. We believe our gross margin and bottom line have ample room for improvement in 2018 as a result of the decrease in raw material costs, our reduced use of OEM, and enhanced cost structure supported by technology and supply chain management initiatives. We are confident in our ability to further expand our global market share in 2018.\"\n\"While many of the details from the Section 201 petition have yet to be ironed out, we have finalized plans to invest in the construction of an advanced solar module manufacturing facility in the southeastern United States to address local market demand. We will continue to invest in advanced manufacturing capacity overseas based on our global order book and market development. Emerging markets are gradually becoming our biggest growth driver, with demand from Latin America and Australia generating substantial growth momentum and the Middle East and African markets expected to rise in the coming year. We will continue to allocate more resources towards these high-growth markets in order to further solidify the long-term sustainable development of JinkoSolar.\"\n\"During the quarter, we continued to optimize our mono wafer production costs and have made substantial progress in crystalizing, cutting and argon recycling during the mono wafer production process. We broke our own world record during the quarter when solar cell efficiency for our P-type mono-crystalline PERC cell hit 23.45%. We also made solid progress in developing N type Hydride Oxide Thin Film (HOT) technology, with an industry-leading 21.9% in average cell efficiency during mass production. With demand increasing, we also plan to expand our production capacity of bifacial cell plus bifacial duo glass modules.\"\n\"We expect global demand to continue growing in 2018. This growth will mostly be driven by the emerging markets. With the cost of solar energy continuing to decrease and support for clean energy globally increasing, solar energy is becoming more and more competitive and are being applied more widely. We are very confident in the industry's long-term sustainability and prospects.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nTotal Revenues\nTotal revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 were RMB6.35 billion (US$976.4 million), a decrease of 1.0% from RMB6.42 billion in the third quarter of 2017 and an increase of 24.0% from RMB5.12 billion in the fourth quarter of 2016. The sequential decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in the shipment of silicon wafers and solar cells in the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase was mainly attributable to an increase in solar module shipments, which was partially offset by a decline in the average selling price of solar modules in 2017.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit in the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB735.3 million (US$113.0 million), compared with RMB772.4 million in the third quarter of 2017 and RMB730.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The sequential decrease was mainly attributable to a slight decline in the gross margin of solar modules in the fourth quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase was mainly attributable to an increase in solar module shipments, which was partially offset by a decline in the average selling price of solar modules in 2017.\nGross margin was 11.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with 12.0% in the third quarter of 2017 and 14.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The sequential decrease was mainly attributable to an increase in polysilicon cost and the appreciation of the RMB against the US dollar. The year-over-year decrease was mainly attributable to a decline in the average selling price of solar modules in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIncome from Operations and Operating Margin\nIncome from operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB91.3 million (US$14.0 million), compared with RMB91.9 million in the third quarter of 2017 and RMB77.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.

The sequential decease was mainly due to a disposal gain in property, plant and equipment, which was partially offset by an increase in provision for accounts receivable. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a disposal gain in property, plant and equipment, which was partially offset by an increase in shipping costs.\nTotal operating expenses accounted for 10.1% of total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 10.6% in the third quarter of 2017 and 12.7% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nInterest Expense, Net\nNet interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 was RMB55.6 million (US$8.5 million), an increase of 6.2% from RMB52.3 million in the third quarter of 2017 and a decrease of 25.5% from RMB74.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The year-over-year decrease was due to a decrease in interest expenses associated with the Company's convertible senior notes, US$61.1 million of which were repurchased in the first quarter of 2017.\nExchange Gain / (Loss), Net\nThe Company recorded a net exchange loss (including change in fair value of forward contracts) of RMB33.9 million (US$5.2 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to a net exchange loss of RMB49.3 million in the third quarter of 2017 and a net exchange gain of RMB17.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.
