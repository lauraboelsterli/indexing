This non-GAAP financial measure has certain limitations, including that it does not have a standardized meaning and, therefore, our definition may be different from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and/or analysts. Thus, it may be more difficult to compare our non-GAAP financial performance to that of other companies. We believe our reporting of adjusted net income/(loss) assists investors in evaluating our operating performance. However, because adjusted net income/(loss) is not a measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, this measure should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, other measures of our financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP, such as net income/(loss).\nNet Income/(Loss) to Adjusted Net Income/(Loss) and Adjusted EPS\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet (loss)/income applicable to Gain Capital Holdings Inc.\n$\n(3.7)\n$\n20.8\n$\n(11.2)\n$\n35.3\nIncome tax (benefit)/expense\n(3.4)\n5.6\n(6.9)\n9.8\nEquity in net loss of affiliate\n0.2\n—\n0.3\n0.1\nNon-controlling interest\n0.2\n0.3\n0.6\n2.1\nPre-tax (loss)/income\n$\n(6.7)\n$\n26.7\n$\n(17.1)\n$\n47.2\nAdjustments (1)\n1.4\n0.3\n6.4\n13.0\nAdjusted pre-tax (loss)/income\n$\n(5.2)\n$\n27.0\n$\n(10.7)\n$\n60.3\nNormalized Income Tax\n1.1\n(5.9)\n2.2\n(13.3)\nEquity in net loss of affiliate\n(0.2)\n—\n(0.3)\n(0.1)\nNon-controlling interest\n(0.2)\n(0.3)\n(0.6)\n(2.1)\nAdjusted net (loss)/income\n$\n(4.5)\n$\n20.8\n$\n(9.4)\n$\n45.0\nAdjusted (loss)/earnings per common share\nBasic\n$\n(0.10)\n$\n0.43\n$\n(0.20)\n$\n0.93\nDiluted\n$\n(0.10)\n$\n0.43\n$\n(0.20)\n$\n0.92\nWeighted average common shares outstanding used in\ncomputing adjusted (loss)/earnings per common share\nBasic\n45,090,984\n48,535,293\n46,740,097\n48,588,917\nDiluted\n45,090,984\n48,763,072\n46,740,097\n48,785,674\n1 Other items include impairment of investment and other corporate expenses\nNote: Dollars in millions, except per share data and where noted otherwise.

This non-GAAP financial measure has certain limitations, including that it does not have a standardized meaning and, therefore, our definition may be different from similar non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and/or analysts. Thus, it may be more difficult to compare our non-GAAP financial performance to that of other companies.

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker, or decision making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Reportable segments are defined as an operating segment that either (a) exceeds 10% of revenue, or (b) reported profit or loss in absolute amount exceeds 10% of profit of all operating segments that did not report a loss or (c) exceeds 10% of the combined assets of all operating segments. The Company's operations relate to global trading services and solutions. Based on the Company's management strategies, and common production, marketing, development and client coverage teams, the Company has concluded that it operates in three operating segments: Retail Segment, Institutional Segment and Futures Segment.\nRetail\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nTrading Revenue\n$\n50.9\n$\n96.2\n$\n231.1\n$\n330.7\nOther Retail Revenue\n1.9\n1.3\n6.3\n5.6\nTotal Revenue\n52.8\n97.5\n237.4\n336.3\nEmployee Comp & Ben\n14.0\n14.4\n60.9\n62.4\nMarketing\n7.5\n9.9\n29.9\n27.7\nReferral Fees\n7.8\n13.5\n39.7\n55.1\nOther Operating Expense\n14.9\n18.3\n61.7\n75.5\nSegment Profit\n$\n8.6\n$\n41.4\n$\n45.2\n$\n115.7\nSegment Profit Margin %\n16\n%\n42\n%\n19\n%\n34\n%\nInstitutional\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nECN\n$\n5.3\n$\n5.7\n$\n23.0\n$\n20.6\nSwap Dealer\n1.7\n3.0\n7.9\n9.6\nOther Revenue\n0.2\n0.0\n0.2\n0.0\nTotal Revenue\n7.1\n8.7\n31.2\n30.2\nEmployee Comp & Ben\n2.8\n4.3\n13.9\n14.5\nMarketing\n—\n—\n0.1\n—\nOther Operating Expense\n3.0\n3.0\n12.3\n10.4\nSegment Profit\n$\n1.2\n$\n1.4\n$\n4.9\n$\n5.4\nSegment Profit Margin %\n17\n%\n16\n%\n16\n%\n18\n%\nNote: Dollars in millions, except where noted otherwise.
