    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Ukraine’s Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman said on Friday that any deficit in gas supply following a breakdown in relations with Russia’s Gazprom ( GAZP.MM ) would be compensated with gas from the European market.\nFILE PHOTO: Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman speaks during the annual end-of-year news conference in Kiev, Ukraine December 22, 2017. REUTERS/Valentyn Ogirenko Gazprom ( GAZP.MM ) said earlier it had asked a court to terminate its gas supply and transit contracts with Ukraine after being ordered to pay $2.56 billion to Kiev in a dispute which the EU said could threaten gas flows to Europe.\nUkraine would return to a normal supply of gas within five days, Groysman said in a televised briefing, after Ukraine’s Naftogaz NAFTO.UL signed an urgent gas supply contract with Poland’s PGNiG.\nReporting by Natalia Zinets; Writing by Polina Ivanova; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ",
