    "text": "53 COMMENTS When Hurricane Harvey hit Houston in August 2017, it dropped more than 50 inches of rain and left a trail of destruction, with more than 345,000 homes damaged.\nSix months after the storm, many Houston-area families are still struggling to rebuild their homes, and their lives. The storm left many homeless and others without income. Those without a safety net were hit particularly hard, and many have had to make tough decisions about how to move forward.\nThe recovery on the ground has been uneven, revealing class divisions. Some have criticized the Federal Emergency Management Agency or FEMA for being slow to approve temporary housing assistance and other aid.\nWatch more videos on Financial Inclusion in America here. In the video above, the latest installment of the Financial Inclusion video series, we profile two families who are attempting to recover from the storm and how different economic situations can hasten, or slow, the process.\nAs Claudia Aguirre, president and CEO of BakerRipley, a local relief organization, explains, “Financial stability is the difference between recovering in six to 18 months, and recovering in three to five years.”\n—With additional reporting by Edward Sanchez\nWrite to Clara Ritger at clara.ritger@wsj.com",
