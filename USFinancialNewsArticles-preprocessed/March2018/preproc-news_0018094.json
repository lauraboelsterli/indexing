    "text": "Education Secretary Betsy DeVos faced student criticism and then abruptly walked out of her own press conference during a visit on Wednesday to the Parkland, Fla. high school where 17 died in a mass shooting last month.\nStudents who have been vocal about the need for gun control spoke out against DeVos in person and on Twitter. DeVos has advocated for arming teachers.\nGood thing I was already planning on sleeping in tomorrow https://t.co/Oy6ALcDHLZ\n‚Äî Emma Gonz√°lez (@Emma4Change) March 7, 2018\nAfter her tour, DeVos told reporters during a press conference that her suggestion to arm teachers wasn‚Äôt something that would be ‚Äúrequired or mandated for every community,‚Äô NY Daily News reports. She also claimed that she would return to the school to sit down with students and ‚Äúfurther delve into the issues.‚Äù\nWhen pressed about arming school staff, the training involved, and opposition by some students, DeVos walked away from the podium and ended the press conference without answering.\nDo something unexpected: answer our questions. You came to our school just for publicity and avoided our questions for the 90 minutes you were actually here. How about you actually do your job? #neveragain #DoYourJob https://t.co/4Ts0INq0gR\n‚Äî Aly Sheehyü¶Ö (@Aly_Sheehy) March 7, 2018\nI thought she would at least give us her \"thoughts and prayers,\" but she refused to even meet/speak with students. I don't understand the point of her being here\n‚Äî Carly Novell (@car_nove) March 7, 2018\nThe school paper claims DeVos refused to meet with any students or speak with them during her time at Stoneman Douglas High School.",
