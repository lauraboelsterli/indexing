    "text": "4 COMMENTS THEY SAY ANY job worth doing is worth doing well. They don’t say, however, that you must personally undertake all that tedious doing. I’d call myself handy, which is to say I can construct IKEA furniture, install a shelf and hang a painting. I once ambitiously swapped a shower head. But if a wall has to be opened up, I call the pros. So when I realized after a recent move that my shower’s water lines were installed backward on the knob—hot as it dribbled out and colder as the pressure increased—I signed up for three of the new-breed apps that make it easier to find fix-it men or women who will solve your problems at a fair price. Here, the respective pros and cons. \nFor Prompt Help I first browsed Homee , a new app focused on electrical, HVAC and plumbing tasks that promises assistance will arrive in about 30 minutes. With the handymen, whose backgrounds are checked, Homee lets you specify a range of experience (in years) before you search, and lets you pay by the minute, not the hour, with an in-app timer you control. It all seemed ideal, but Homee’s service is slowly rolling out and was as yet unavailable in my area. Still I persist. ( homeeonedemand.com ) \nFor Intense Response Hoping to be “the Uber of” handyman apps, Thumbtack locks in on your location, asks a detailed list of questions to help narrow down exactly what you need and matches you with those best equipped to do the job. Pick a skill level (or price) with which you’re comfortable and your savior can often assist you that day. However, Thumbtack left me confronting an onslaught of would-be aides, as if nine Uber cars showed up before I’d even confirmed a ride. Thirty minutes after I signed up, workers were emailing to offer me a “good deal” if I called them directly—not the model for me, but great if you see eagerness as a virtue. ( thumbtack.com ) \nFor the Most Options Next I opened TaskRabbit , selected “plumbing” from a drop-down menu and was then annoyingly forced to write a little essay detailing my issue—which didn’t seem to matter since I was given an immediate list of candidates. I soon found Joe Dzwill, a Bronx-based handyman who, judging from his photo, appeared to have as many tattoos as he did positive reviews. TaskRabbit displayed his skills, work history, rating, rate and schedule. I picked a time, we exchanged emails, and soon he was shaking my hand and fixing my shower. He was done in about 30 minutes (it was a simpler task than I imagined), but TaskRabbit charged me the full hour. Still, since I hadn’t washed up in three days it felt like a small price.
