    "text": "JOHANNESBURG, March 8 (Reuters) - South Africa’s state-run power utility Eskom said on Thursday it would launch its own probe into a contract with German software maker SAP which has ensnared the company in a wider graft scandal.\nSAP said on Thursday it had found compliance breaches and “indications of misconduct” in public sector deals in South Africa involving the Guptas, friends of former president Jacob Zuma accused of corruption.\nBoth Zuma and the Guptas have denied any wrongdoing.
