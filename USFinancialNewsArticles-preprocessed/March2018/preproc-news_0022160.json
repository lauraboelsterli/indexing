    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tellurian Inc.

View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180312005370/en/\nDriftwood Holdings structure 2018 (Graphic: Business Wire)\nPresident and CEO Meg Gentle said, “Tellurian plans to acquire 15 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of natural gas over the project life as part of our overall integrated strategy for the development of Driftwood Holdings. We are looking primarily in the Haynesville shale and are speaking with many producers, but we have no transaction close to completion at this point. Any asset acquisition would occur at the Driftwood Holdings level and would be financed from proceeds of third-party investments in Driftwood Holdings. We continue to make very good progress in our discussions with third-party investors, expect to execute agreements in Driftwood Holdings over the next few months, and be in a position to close funding of phase one for 11 million tonnes between the third and fourth quarters of 2018.”\nDriftwood Holdings will construct and operate a standalone U.S.-based integrated liquefied natural gas business. Tellurian announced in January that it had engaged Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC (Goldman Sachs) and SG Americas Securities, LLC (Societe Generale) to serve as financial advisors for Driftwood Holdings LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tellurian formed to own and operate Tellurian’s gas producing assets, pipeline assets, and the Driftwood LNG export facility. Tellurian is offering equity interests in Driftwood Holdings at a cost of $1,500 per tonne in exchange for liquefied natural gas at cost.\nAbout Tellurian Inc.\nTellurian was founded by Charif Souki and Martin Houston and is led by President and CEO Meg Gentle. Tellurian intends to create value for shareholders by building a low-cost, global natural gas business, profitably delivering natural gas to customers worldwide. Tellurian is developing a portfolio of natural gas production, LNG trading, and infrastructure that includes an ~ 27.6 mtpa LNG export facility and an associated pipeline. Tellurian is based in Houston, Texas, and its common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “TELL”.\nFor more information, please visit www.tellurianinc.com .\nFollow us on Twitter at twitter.com/TellurianLNG\nCAUTIONARY INFORMATION ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of U.S. federal securities laws.
