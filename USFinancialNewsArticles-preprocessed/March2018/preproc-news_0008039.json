Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc. completed the acquisition of WashingtonFirst Bankshares, Inc. (“WashingtonFirst”) effective January 1, 2018, but today is celebrated as “Client Day One” in recognition of full conversion of all systems and branding providing all clients full access.\n“With full conversion complete today, all clients now have direct access to all of our comprehensive products and services with more branches across the region, especially in DC and Virginia,” said Daniel J.

This unique approach is what sets us apart,” said Schrider.\nAbout Sandy Spring Bancorp, Inc.\nSandy Spring Bancorp, Inc., headquartered in Olney, Maryland, is the holding company for Sandy Spring Bank.
