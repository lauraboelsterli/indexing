A bird is seen near the turbine of a McDonnell-Douglas MD-11 jet of Lufthansa Cargo AG flying above the tarmac of the Yemelyanovo International Airport, on its way to Frankfurt from Beijing and Seoul, outside the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk August 15, 2015. REUTERS/Ilya Naymushin/File Photo Lufthansa’s freight division, which transports goods in specialist freighter planes plus in the bellies of Lufthansa Group airlines, reported profit of 242 million euros ($299 million) for 2017, compared with a loss of 50 million euros for 2016. “Colleagues are fighting for the freight capacity, it’s a very satisfactory position to be in,” Carsten Spohr said, saying he was seeing no impact on business from trade tensions. He said the outlook for 2018 was positive and added Lufthansa would be interested in used or new freighters for the business. ($1 = 0.8097 euros)",
