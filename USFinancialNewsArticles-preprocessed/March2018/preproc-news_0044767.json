    "text": "EAGAN, Minn., March 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ConvergeOne Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CVON, CVONW) (\" ConvergeOne \") today announced that it is increasing the price of, and extending the scheduled expiration of, its previously announced cash tender offer to purchase ConvergeOne warrants. ConvergeOne also announced that it expects to receive a letter from the Listing Qualifications Office of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\" Nasdaq \"), indicating that Nasdaq intends to delist ConvergeOne's warrants (NASDAQ: CVONW) from the Nasdaq Capital Market for the failure to meet the requisite number of warrant holders requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5515(a)(4).\nOn February 22, 2018, ConvergeOne consummated the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 30, 2017, by and among Forum Merger Corporation (\" Forum \"), FMC Merger Subsidiary Corp., FMC Merger Subsidiary LLC, C1 Investment Corp., and Clearlake Capital Management III, L.P. (the \" Business Combination \"). In connection with the closing, Forum changed its name from Forum Merger Corporation to ConvergeOne Holdings, Inc. As of the open of trading on February 23, 2018, the common stock and warrants of ConvergeOne began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market as \"CVON\" and \"CVONW\", respectively.\nPrice Increase of Tender Offer\nConvergeOne has decided to increase the price of its previously announced tender offer to purchase up to 8,936,250 of its outstanding warrants (the \" Tender Offer \") from $0.95 per warrant to $1.20 per warrant.\nPursuant to the terms of the previously announced Tender Offer, ConvergeOne has offered to purchase 8,936,250 of its outstanding warrants at a price of $1.20 per warrant, in cash, without interest. The purpose of the Tender Offer is to provide warrant holders that may not wish to retain their warrants following the Business Combination the possibility of receiving cash for their warrants.\nThe number of warrants that ConvergeOne is offering to purchase represents all of its outstanding warrants. The reported closing price of the warrants was $0.952 per warrant on March 22, 2018. The Tender Offer is not conditioned on any financing or on any minimum number of warrants being tendered.\nCowen and Company, LLC is acting as the dealer manager for the Tender Offer, Morrow Sodali LLC is acting as the information agent for the Tender Offer, and the depositary for the Tender Offer is Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. The offer to purchase, letter of transmittal, and related documents have been previously distributed to the warrant holders.\nExtension of Scheduled Expiration of Tender Offer\nAdditionally, ConvergeOne has decided to extend the expiration date of the Tender Offer such that it now expires at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 13, 2018 unless further extended. The Tender Offer was previously scheduled to expire at 12:00 Midnight, New York City time, at the end of the day on March 23, 2018.\nHolders of ConvergeOne warrants who have already tendered their ConvergeOne warrants into the Tender Offer do not have to re-tender their ConvergeOne warrants or take any other action as a result of the extension of the expiration date of the Tender Offer.\nPotential Delisting of Warrants\nFollowing the completion of the Business Combination, ConvergeOne was required to submit to Nasdaq data regarding round lot holders of its common stock and warrants. Based on ConvergeOne's review of such data, it has preliminarily concluded that its warrants do not meet the minimum 400 round lot holder requirement for listing as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5515(a)(4). Although Nasdaq is still reviewing the data, ConvergeOne expects Nasdaq will issue a delisting notice. If ConvergeOne receives a delisting notice from Nasdaq, it currently does not intend to appeal such delisting determination. Nevertheless, ConvergeOne anticipates that its warrants would remain eligible to be Quote: d on either the OTC Bulletin Board or \"Pink Sheets\" thereafter. No assurance, however, can be made that trading in ConvergeOne's warrants on the OTC Bulletin Board or \"Pink Sheets\" will commence or be maintained.\nConvergeOne believes that any possible delisting of ConvergeOne's warrants will not affect the continued trading of ConvergeOne's common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nAbout ConvergeOne\nFounded in 1993, ConvergeOne is a leading global IT service provider of collaboration and technology solutions for large and medium enterprises with decades of experience assisting customers to transform their digital infrastructure and realize a return on investment.
