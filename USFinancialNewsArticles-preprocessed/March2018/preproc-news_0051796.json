    "text": "* U.S. to sell $35 bln 5-year notes, $89 bln T-bills * U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly falls in March * Investors most upbeat on Treasuries since June -JPMorgan (Updates market action, adds Quote: , table) By Richard Leong NEW YORK, March 27 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields fell on Tuesday as fund managers bought bonds to rebalance their portfolios for quarter-end in advance of more government debt supply. The U.S. Treasury Department will sell $65 billion in one-month bills; $24 billion in one-year T-bills and $35 billion in five-year notes. They are part of this week's record high $294 billion in government debt for sale. Monday's $30 billion two-year note issue, along with $51 billion in three-month bills and $45 billion in six-month bills, drew mediocre demand, analysts said. Lingering worries about a trade war between the United States and China have supported safe-haven demand for Treasuries, though Wall Street stock prices rose for a second day on Tuesday following last week's plunge tied to fears about an escalation of trade barriers between the world's two biggest economies. \"Despite todayâ€™s stock market rebound, 'flight-to-quality' sentiment may still linger given market concerns over trade policies, which could be supportive for demand,\" analysts at Nomura Securities International wrote in a research note. The share of investors who are bullish on longer-dated Treasuries rose to its highest level since last June, a survey from JPMorgan released on Tuesday showed. Moreover, the Conference Board said its gauge of U.S. consumer confidence unexpectedly fell to 127.7 in March from a revised 130.0 in February. At 11:01 a.m. (1501 GMT), the yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down 2.2 basis points to 2.819 percent. The two-year Treasury yield was down 2.2 basis points to 2.294 percent, while the 30-year Treasury yield was down 1.4 basis points to 3.057 percent.
