    "text": "Albemarle : \"Don't touch it. The bloom is off the lithium rose. Why is that? Because Sociedad Quimica , which is the largest producer in Chile, is overproducing.\"\nUniversal Display Corporation : \"People feel that there's not enough OLED being used in the new devices, so we're going to have to wait to see if that's the case.\"\nCIT Group : \"We've got financials that are so unbelievably good like J.P. Morgan . Why are we reaching for that one? I mean, it's OK, but we need to go with the big guns.\"\nOneok Inc. : \"I have cooled on the fossil fuel stocks. A whole new generation of investors are saying no to them. A 5.4 percent yield is not enough to attract.\"\nExpress Scripts Holdings : \"The analysts never stop loving ESRX. I don't care for it. There's so many other great companies. Why not look at Abbott Labs ?\"\nValley National Bancorp : \"I think right here is a great level to buy it.\"\nSquare : \"I'm sticking with Square. I think it's still good.\"\nFMC Corp : \"I'm going to say this one's OK. It has come down enough that I'm going to say it's OK to own.\"\nManitowoc Company : \"Manitowoc has come down almost 30 percent. I think that's wrong. I think this is a decent level to start buying.\"\nRadius Health : \"We've got stocks like Bristol-Myers that are down so much. I'd rather be in that one.\"\nWatch the full lightning round here: show chapters Cramer's lightning round: Don't touch the stock of Albemarle 14 Hours Ago | 04:22 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Abbott Laboratories and J.P.
