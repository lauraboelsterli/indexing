The comparable restaurant sales decrease at company-operated restaurants was composed of a decrease in transactions, partially offset by increases in price and mix.\nTotal revenues increased 6.2% to $148.1 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 from $139.4 million in the prior year fiscal quarter. The increase was primarily due to a net additional 48 system-wide restaurants at December 31, 2017 compared to December 25, 2016 and an incremental fourteenth operating week during the fourth fiscal quarter 2017, partially offset by comparable restaurant sales declines at our company-operated and franchised restaurants.\nCompany-operated restaurant revenues increased 6.1% to $140.3 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 from $132.2 million in the prior year fiscal quarter. Franchise royalty revenues increased 11.3% to $7.6 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 from $6.8 million in the prior year fiscal quarter.\nRestaurant contribution, a non-GAAP measure, decreased 13.2% to $22.5 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 from $26.0 million in the prior year fiscal quarter. As a percentage of company restaurant revenues, restaurant contribution margin, a non-GAAP measure, decreased to 16.1% in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 from 19.6% in the prior year fiscal quarter.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased 9.6% to $9.8 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 from $10.9 million in the prior year fiscal quarter.\nNet Income increased to $48.8 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 compared to $9.8 million in the prior year fiscal quarter. During the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017, the Company recognized a deferred income tax benefit of $40.1 million as a result of the revaluation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Diluted Net Income per Share increased to $1.27 in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 compared to $0.26 in the prior year fiscal quarter.\nAdjusted Net Income, a non-GAAP measure, decreased 17.9% to $8.7 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 compared to $10.6 million in the prior year fiscal quarter. Adjusted Diluted Net Income per Share decreased 17.9% to $0.23 in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 compared to $0.28 in the prior year fiscal quarter.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, decreased 10.8% to $21.9 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 from $24.6 million in the prior year fiscal quarter.\nFiscal Year 201 8 Guidance\nBojangles’ is providing an annual outlook for the 52-week period ending on December 30, 2018:\nTotal revenues of $550.0 million to $560.0 million (including approximately $11.0 million of franchise marketing and co-op advertising contribution revenues due to the change in the revenue recognition rules); System-wide comparable restaurant sales of negative low-single digits to flat; The opening of 30 to 40 system-wide restaurants, comprised of 6 to 10 company-operated restaurants and 24 to 30 franchised restaurants; Restaurant contribution margin of 14.0% to 14.5%; General and administrative expenses of $43.0 million to $43.5 million; Cash capital expenditures of $11.5 million to $12.5 million; Adjusted Diluted Net Income per Share of $0.64 to $0.72; and Adjusted EBITDA of $64.0 million to $68.0 million.\nWe have not reconciled guidance for Adjusted Diluted Net Income per Share or Adjusted EBITDA to the corresponding because we do not provide guidance for the various reconciling items. We are unable to provide guidance for these reconciling items because we cannot determine their probable significance, as certain items are outside of our control and cannot be reasonably predicted due to the fact that these items could vary significantly from period to period. Accordingly, reconciliations to the corresponding are not available without unreasonable effort.\nConference Call and Webcast Today\nBojangles’ will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the fourth fiscal quarter 2017 and fiscal year 2017 results, as well as fiscal year 2018 guidance today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

We believe these non-GAAP measures assist our board of directors, management and investors in comparing our operating performance, on a consistent basis from period to period, by isolating the effects of certain items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary significantly among similar companies. Bojangles’ cautions that non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, reported GAAP results.\nRestaurant contribution represents our operating income excluding the impact of franchise royalty revenues, other franchise revenues, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, impairment and (gain) loss on disposal of property and equipment and other, as identified by the reconciliation table below. Restaurant contribution margin is defined as restaurant contribution as a percentage of company-operated restaurant revenues. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are supplemental measures of operating performance of our company-operated restaurants and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to those reported by other companies. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Included with the reconciliations to GAAP figures provided in the tables at the end of this release is a reconciliation of our restaurant contribution to the line item on the condensed consolidated statements of operations entitled “Company-operated restaurant revenues,” which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP measure on our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nAdjusted Net Income represents company net income before items that we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance as identified in the reconciliation table below. Adjusted Diluted Net Income per Share represents company diluted net income per share before items that we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance as identified in the reconciliation table below.\nEBITDA represents company net income before interest expense (net of interest income), provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents company net income before interest expense (net of interest income), provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, items that we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance and certain non-cash items, as identified in the reconciliation table below.\nAdjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In addition, in evaluating Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Net Income per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.\nThis release contains forward-looking statements.

Actual results may differ materially from these expectations due to risks relating to, among other risks, our vulnerability to changes in consumer preferences and economic conditions; our ability to open restaurants in new and existing markets and expand our franchise system; our ability to generate comparable restaurant sales growth; financial or other difficulties, which could cause our restaurants and our franchisees’ restaurants to close; our ability to generate increased sales or profits from new menu items, advertising campaigns, changes in discounting strategy, technology initiatives or restaurant designs and remodels; cancellation of or delay in anticipated future restaurant openings; our reliance on, limited degree of control over and potential responsibility for, our franchisees; increases in the cost of chicken, pork, dairy, wheat, corn and other products; our ability to compete successfully with other quick-service and fast-casual restaurants; our vulnerability to conditions in the Southeastern United States; negative publicity, whether or not valid; concerns about food safety and quality and about food-borne illnesses, including adverse public perception due to the occurrence of avian flu, swine flu or other food-borne illnesses, such as salmonella , E. coli , or others; changes in employment and labor laws; labor shortages and increases in labor costs; the impact of litigation, including wage and hour class action lawsuits; and our dependence upon frequent and timely deliveries of restaurant food and other supplies.
