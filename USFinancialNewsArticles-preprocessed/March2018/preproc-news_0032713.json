    "text": "2 Hours Ago | 00:55 \nMass production of 3-D printed cars is coming soon. The first will be from start-up XEV and Polymaker, a developer of 3-D printing materials. \nThe $7,500 car, called LSEV, only took three days to make according to the creator . All of the components in LSEV were printed except for the chassis, seats and glass. \nThe two-seater looks a lot like a Smart car, but it isn't quite as fast. Its top speed is about 43 miles per hour. It can travel about 93 miles on a single charge. \nThe car will be available in Asia and Europe in 2019.",
