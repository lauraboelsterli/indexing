A branch of Carpetright is seen in south west London, Britain January 19, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville Carpetright, which has issued a series of profit-warnings because of tepid high-street spending, said it would also look to reduce its property portfolio. It has agreed the loan with shareholder Meditor. Reporting by Elisabeth O'Leary; Editing by Kate Holton",
