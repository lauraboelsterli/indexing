Soccer fans pose in front of Mater Dei hospital where soccer star Neymar is undergoing surgery on a fractured metatarsal and a sprained ankle, in Belo Horizonte, Brazil March 3, 2018. REUTERS/Paulo Whitaker The world’s most expensive player was operated on by the Brazil national team doctor in Belo Horizonte to repair the fractured metatarsal and sprained ankle he suffered in last weekend’s French league match against Olympique Marseille. Rodrigo Lasmar inserted a pin in the fifth metatarsal and the procedure“went perfectly,” the CBF said in words almost identical to those used by the French club in their statement. “The post-op rehabilitation will begin immediately with the presence of a PSG physiotherapist,” the CBF added.

Brazil start their campaign against Switzerland on June 17 before facing Costa Rica and Serbia. Neymar, who became the world’s most expensive player last August when PSG paid 222 million euros ($271 million) to sign him from Barcelona, has 53 goals in 83 games for Brazil, with 28 goals and 16 assists for the Ligue 1 leaders this season.
