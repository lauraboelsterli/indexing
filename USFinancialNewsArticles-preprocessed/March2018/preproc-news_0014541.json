    "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Devon Energy Corp. (NYSE: DVN) announced today that its board of directors approved a 33 percent increase in its quarterly common stock dividend beginning in the second quarter of 2018. The new quarterly dividend rate will be $0.08 per share, compared to the prior quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share. The increased dividend is payable on June 29, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 15, 2018.\nDevon also announced today that its board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion share-repurchase program of the company’s common stock over the next year. All purchases will be made in accordance with applicable laws from time to time in open market or private transactions, depending on market conditions, and may be discontinued at any time. At the current share price, this program covers approximately 6 percent of the company’s outstanding common stock.\n“In conjunction with the sale of our Johnson County assets, today’s announcement to increase the cash dividend and initiate a share-repurchase program is consistent with our strategic plan and demonstrates our firm commitment to enhance shareholder value,” said Dave Hager, president and CEO. “With our disciplined multi-year plan, we expect to generate substantial amounts of excess cash flow at prices above our base planning scenario of $50 WTI pricing and through additional portfolio simplification efforts. We are confident in our ability to execute on these initiatives and, as market conditions permit, we will continue to pursue opportunities to further increase cash returns to our shareholders.”\nIn addition to these actions to increase cash returns to shareholders, the company is committed to reducing debt associated with its upstream business. The company separately announced a tender offer to purchase certain of its debt securities up to a maximum repurchase amount of $1.0 billion.\nAbout Devon Energy\nDevon Energy is a leading independent energy company engaged in finding and producing oil and natural gas.
