Soccer Football - Premier League - Everton vs Manchester United - Goodison Park, Liverpool, Britain - January 1, 2018 Manchester United's Paul Pogba takes a throw-in as Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho and Everton manager Sam Allardyce look on REUTERS/Andrew Yates EDITORIAL USE ONLY.

Pogba was ruled out after picking up an injury in the team’s final training session before the match and Mourinho is awaiting information on whether he can shake off the knock in time for the visit of the Spanish side. “I don’t know,” Mourinho told British media when asked about Pogba’s availability for the second leg of their last 16 match. “He’s downstairs now and I will go and speak with him. The injury? It was contact with a player in the last minute of the training session. “If I finished the session one minute before it wouldn’t have happened,” the Portuguese manager added. United’s record signing Pogba has been criticised for his performances this season and Mourinho benched the 24-year-old for their goalless draw at Sevilla in the first leg last month. Pogba came on as a substitute early in that game after midfielder Ander Herrera pulled up injured. Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; editing by Sudipto Ganguly",
