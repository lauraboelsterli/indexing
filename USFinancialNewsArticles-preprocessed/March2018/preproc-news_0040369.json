    "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Latest on the $1.3 trillion spending bill (all times local):\n10:05 a.m.\nThe conservative House Freedom Caucus says it would support   if he vetoed a $1.3 trillion spending bill.\nRepublican Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, chairman of the freedom caucus, says in a tweet the group would \"fully support\" a veto. He adds that Congress should pass a short-term budget resolution while Trump and congressional leaders \"negotiate a better deal for the forgotten men and women of America.\"\nThe Freedom Caucus had urged Trump to veto the giant bill passed on Thursday. It says the bill does not have enough money for the border wall, leaves intact   law and funds Planned Parenthood.\nThe government faces a midnight shutdown if a spending bill is not signed.\n9:15 a.m.\nPresident Trump says he is   a giant $1.3 trillion spending bill, citing concerns over \"Dreamers\" and border wall funding.\nTrump says on Twitter Friday morning: \"I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based  \nTrump's tweet created confusion after Congress gave final approval early Friday to the spending bill, which is needed to avert a federal shutdown.\nOn Thursday, Trump's budget   said that Trump would sign the bill.\n2:10 a.m.\nCongress has given final approval to a giant $1.3 trillion spending bill that ends the budget battles for now. But that came only after late obstacles skirted close to another shutdown as conservatives objected to big outlays on Democratic priorities. Republicans control the House, Senate and White House.\nSenate passage on Friday shortly  167.",
