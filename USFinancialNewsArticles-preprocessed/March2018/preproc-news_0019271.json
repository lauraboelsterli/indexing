    "text": "BOSTON, March 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Boston-based cancer company Partner Therapeutics, Inc. (PTx) announced today the appointment of Ellen Hukkelhoven and Terry Gould to the company's Board of Directors. Dr. Hukkelhoven and Mr. Gould join the company's founders Bob Mulroy and Debasish Roychowdhury as directors.\nDr. Ellen Hukkelhoven is a Senior Analyst at Perceptive Advisors, a leading healthcare investment firm. Perceptive invests in highly innovative therapies aimed at the treatment of true unmet medical needs. The team is dedicated to supporting these companies throughout their entire life cycle. Ellen also serves on the board of MeiraGTx. She received her PhD in Cancer Biology from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. During her tenure at MSKCC, she founded and built the life sciences division of InSITE, a top graduate fellowship program that helps early stage companies with their most pressing needs. Ellen graduated magna cum laude from Princeton University with degrees in Molecular Biology and Finance.\nMr. Gould is a Partner and Head of Venture Growth Equity Investments with Adams Street Partners. He invests in venture and growth-oriented companies with a focus on the healthcare space. Mr. Gould also sits on the board of directors of Aptinyx, Atox Bio, Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Fusion Pharmaceuticals, LifeBond, Orbus Therapeutics and Outpost Medicine. He was a former board member at Naurex (acquired by Allergan), INC Research, Incline Therapeutics (acquired by the Medicines Company), OncoMed and Proteus Biomedical. Mr. Gould is also a member of the Adams Street Executive and Direct Investment Committees.\n\"We are thrilled with the additions of Dr. Hukkelhoven and Mr. Gould to our Board of Directors,\" said PTx CEO Robert Mulroy. \"Ellen and Terry bring with them deep experience as stewards of successful growth companies that will help guide our company to ever higher levels of performance.\"\n\"I am pleased to have the opportunity to work with the team at PTx to help fill the development and commercial gaps for this important cancer treatment,\" said Dr. Hukkelhoven. Mr. Gould added, \"PTx has a compelling vision and a strong team with a track record of success.\"\nOn February 1 st , PTx announced it acquired the global rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize Leukine from Sanofi. Leukine is a multi-lineage immune-stimulant that has been demonstrated to promote growth and activation of monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells. It is the only FDA-approved recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). It is currently indicated for the treatment of AML in older adults to reduce the incidence of severe and life-threatening infections resulting in death; use in the treatment of allogeneic bone marrow transplants to reduce the incidence of bacteremia and other culture positive infections and shorten the median duration of hospitalization; and to prolong the survival of patients who are experiencing bone marrow transplant failure or delay.\nLeukine is currently being tested in over 100 clinical studies to assess its ability to increase the efficacy of immuno-oncology therapies, improve the treatment of pulmonary and neurological disorders, and improve the treatment of infections.\nAbout Partner Therapeutics, Inc.:\nPTx is an integrated commercial stage biotech company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics that improve health and economic outcomes in the treatment of cancer. PTx's development focus spans the entire range of cancer therapy from primary treatments to supportive care. The company believes in delivering great products in support of medical teams with the purpose of creating the best possible outcomes for patients and their families.\nwww.partnertx.com\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/partner-therapeutics-ptx-announces-the-appointment-of-ellen-hukkelhoven-phd-and-terry-gould-to-its-board-of-directors-300609567.html\nSOURCE Partner Therapeutics, Inc.",
