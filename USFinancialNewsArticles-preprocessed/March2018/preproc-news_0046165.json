    "text": "CORTE MADERA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- RH (NYSE:RH) today announced fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 results and RH Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Gary Friedman, provided an update on the Company’s continued evolution and outlook.\nRH leadership will host a Q&A conference call at 2:00 p.m. PT (5:00 p.m. ET) today.\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nGAAP net revenues of $670.3 million, an increase of 14% versus last year. Adjusted net revenues of $669.7 million, an increase of 13% versus last year. GAAP net income of $0.3 million, inclusive of a $33.7 million goodwill impairment related to Waterworks. Adjusted net income of $43.3 million, an increase of 55% versus last year. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.01 compared to $0.23 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.69, an increase of 149% versus last year. Free cash flow of $129.5 million versus $24.4 million last year.\nFiscal Year Highlights\nGAAP and adjusted net revenues of $2.44 billion, an increase of 14% versus last year. GAAP net income of $2.2 million compared to $5.4 million last year. Adjusted net income of $89.2 million, an increase of 72% versus last year. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.07 compared to $0.13 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.05, an increase of 140% versus last year. Merchandise inventories of $527.0 million, a decrease of 30%, versus $752.3 million last year. Free cash flow of $432.8 million. The Company repurchased 20.2 million shares of common stock in fiscal 2017 at an average price of $49.46.\nTo Our People, Partners, and Shareholders,\nOur fourth quarter results continue to demonstrate the earnings power of our new membership model and a dramatically more efficient operating platform. Adjusted net revenues increased 13% to $670 million, with adjusted net income reaching a record $43 million, up 55% versus a year ago. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.69, a 149% increase versus last year, and the Company generated nearly $130 million of free cash flow in the quarter.\n2017 - The Year of Execution, Architecture and Cash\n2017 was the year of execution, architecture and cash at RH. Our efforts were focused on executing our new membership model, architecting a new operating platform and maximizing cash flow by increasing revenues and earnings, and decreasing inventory and capital spending.\nWith 95% of our core RH business driven by members, we can confidently declare our move from a promotional to membership model a success. Membership has enhanced our brand, streamlined our operations and vastly improved the customer experience. We’ve made significant progress redesigning our operating platform, inclusive of closing two distribution centers, simplifying our reverse logistics and outlet model, and reducing inventory by $225 million, or 30% versus a year ago. Our focus on cash resulted in the Company generating $433 million in free cash flow in 2017, enabling the repurchase of 20.2 million shares of RH stock, which we believe will continue to be an excellent allocation of capital for the long term benefit of our shareholders.\nWe ended the year with $339 million of aggregate debt, outside of the convertible notes that are due June 2019 and June 2020. Based on forecasted free cash flow in excess of $250 million in 2018, and our outlook for 2019 and beyond, our current plan is to repay the convertible notes in cash to minimize dilution. As a result of our rapidly improving balance sheet and the continued strong performance of our business, we find ourselves with multiple attractive financing options available to us, and expect further improvement to our balance sheet and capital structure in the year ahead.\nWe continued our quest to revolutionize physical retailing in 2017 as we opened RH Toronto and RH West Palm, our second and third locations with integrated cafés, wine vaults and barista bars. We have demonstrated our ability to replicate the success of our first integrated hospitality experience at RH Chicago, The Gallery at the Historic 3 Arts Club, which Instagram reported as the 7th most Instagrammed café in the country last year. Wedding proposals in the 3 Arts Café have now exceeded 50 since we opened our doors in October of 2015 and we continue to have a line that forms around the block on weekends before opening. We previously announced that the 3 Arts Café exceeded $5 million in revenues in 2016, its first full year of operation, and we are delighted to report that it has comped positive since, as we refine our menus and improve execution. These numbers would be impressive for any restaurant, but are especially so for a café in the middle of a furniture store, with no exterior signage, a limited all day menu, no bar, and last seating at 8pm.\nWe could not be more pleased with the early results being generated in both Toronto and West Palm, neither of which was initially designed with hospitality. In both cases, due to the success of Chicago, we delayed construction and creatively found a way to integrate our hospitality offering into the Galleries. Nonetheless, RH Toronto’s hospitality offering, with limited seating, and no wine vault, is tracking slightly below Chicago’s first year numbers adjusting for the exchange rate. RH West Palm, where we were able to test our first rooftop restaurant, is turning out to be our most successful. Our West Palm hospitality offering is trending 35% ahead of Chicago’s year one numbers, and is on track to exceed $7 million in 2018.\nWe never had a goal of opening high volume restaurants but rather provide an amenity for our clients who spend hours in our showrooms designing their homes. Our secondary goal was to drive incremental traffic into our Galleries, with the hope that some of the visitors who might have never entered a furniture store would be moved by the environment and inspired to reimagine their life at home. I’m pleased to report that our initial foray into food and beverage with RH President of Hospitality Brendan Sodikoff, and his team, has far exceeded our expectations on every level, generating publicity, traffic, and an incremental sales lift in our Galleries. We will continue to aggressively invest in building a world class hospitality platform that we believe will render the RH brand more unique and valuable.\n2018 - A Continued Focus on Execution, Architecture and Cash\nIn 2018, we will continue our focus on execution, architecture and cash. We will once again hold ourselves back from adding new businesses outside of our ongoing investments in RH Hospitality as we work to design an operating platform that aligns with and amplifies our luxury positioning, inclusive of continued work on our distribution center network redesign, reverse logistics and outlet redesign, and the reconceptualization of home delivery. As discussed at our Investor Day, we will remain focused on optimizing the profitability of our new platform, and will be managing the business in 2018 with a bias for earnings versus revenue growth. We will restrain ourselves from chasing low quality revenues as others are doing in our industry, and instead focus on building a superior operating model that will enable us to compete and win over the long term. It is clear to us, as we witness the continued failures of high growth - no profit, online pure plays, and the declining operating margins of traditional retailers, that the complexities and costs of scaling a furniture business will favor those who control their brand from concept to customer, have an integrated platform with superior logistics, and offer the customer both a compelling physical and digital experience. The road of endless promotions, free shipping, an unnatural shift to online, and a shrinking store base, is resulting in broken and unsustainable retail models. We prefer the road less traveled by, and like Robert Frost, believe it will make all the difference.\nAs you can see in our outlook, due to the above mentioned priorities, we are forecasting a more conservative view of revenue growth, yet are raising our expectations for strong earnings growth in 2018. Our adjusted operating margins are now forecasted to be in an industry-leading range of 9.2% to 10.2%, while generating free cash flow in excess of $250 million. Adjusted gross margins are expected to increase 260 to 340 basis points as we cycle our SKU rationalization and inventory reduction efforts from last year. We’ve meaningfully raised our adjusted net income outlook to a range of $145 to $165 million, an increase of 63% to 85% over last year, and versus our prior guidance of $125 to $145 million, reflecting the benefits of a more efficient operating platform with an expected tax rate of 26%.\nWe plan to open four new Galleries in 2018, Portland, Nashville, Yountville and New York, the latter three with integrated cafés, wine vaults and barista bars. The Nashville Gallery is our first attempt to replicate the architecture and layout of RH Chicago, with a central courtyard café that features a soaring steel and glass atrium where you will dine under heritage olive trees while listening to the sounds of trickling fountains. RH New York is a six level shopping experience connected by a grand staircase that features the art installation “Rain”, by the renowned Los Angeles artist, architect, and designer Allison Berger, a dramatic central atrium with stacked cast iron columns, and a glass elevator that lifts you up to a rooftop café encased in a glass box, and surrounded by a beautiful landscaped park with all day sunshine and incredible views of downtown. RH New York, The Gallery in the Historic Meatpacking District, provides us the rare opportunity, in arguably the most important city in the world, to develop a ground up retail experience like no other, and will prove to be worth the wait.\n2019 - A Pivot to High Quality, Sustainable Growth\nOur plan is to pivot the Company back to growth in 2019 by returning to our product and business expansion strategy and reaccelerating our real estate transformation.\nWe plan a return to our product and business expansion strategy in 2019, which has been on hold as we focused on our move to membership and the architecture of a new operating platform. We have several new business and brand extension plans in our pipeline, and look forward to unveiling them beginning next year.\nWe have also developed a new prototype Design Gallery that will enable us to more quickly place our disruptive product assortment and immersive retail experience into the market. The new prototype is based on key learnings from a number of our recent Gallery openings and will range in size from 33,000 square feet inclusive of our integrated hospitality experience to 29,000 square feet without, and will represent our assortments from RH Interiors, RH Modern, RH Baby&Child, RH Teen and RH Outdoor. Due to the reduced square footage and efficient design, these new Galleries will be significantly more capital efficient with less time and cost risk. We anticipate these new Galleries will represent approximately two thirds of our target markets and enable us to ramp from 3 to 5 new Galleries per year to a pace of 5 to 7. We will continue to develop and open larger Bespoke Design Galleries in the top metropolitan markets, and indigenous Bespoke Galleries in the best second home markets where the wealthy and affluent visit and vacation. Examples include the Hamptons, Aspen, Palm Beach, and the Napa Valley, among others. This summer we are opening RH Yountville, the Gallery in the Napa Valley. We’ve developed an experience reflective of the local culture, integrating food, wine, art, and design into an immersive compound that will connect visitors and residents to our unique and authentic point of view, while positioning RH as a taste and design authority.\nAdditionally, we are continuing to evolve from a leasing to a development model that will reduce our occupancy costs and increase our return on capital. We currently have two projects, Yountville, CA, and Edina, MN, under construction using this new model and have an additional five projects in the development process.\nWe are introducing an Intermediate and Long Term Outlook with expectations for accelerated revenue growth and continued margin expansion. By cycling the significant start-up costs from RH Hospitality, neutralizing the earnings drag from Waterworks, benefitting from the continued cost savings of our new operating platform, and leveraging the gain we expect from our real estate transformation, we now have a clear path to operating margins in the low to mid-teens by 2021.\nWe remain confident in our long term goal of $4 to $5 billion in North American revenues with industry leading operating margins and returns on invested capital. We also believe there is tremendous potential for the RH brand internationally, and we continue to explore opportunities to open our first Gallery in London.\nBuilding a Brand with No Peer and a Customer Experience That Cannot Be Replicated Online\nWe do understand that many of the strategies we are pursuing — opening the largest specialty retail experiences in our industry while most are shrinking the size of the retail footprint or closing stores; moving from a promotional to a membership model, while others are increasing promotions, positioning their brands around price versus product; continuing to mail inspiring Source Books, while many are eliminating catalogs; and refusing to follow the herd in self-promotion on social media, instead allowing our brand to be defined by the taste, style, design and quality of the products and experiences we are creating — are all in direct conflict with conventional wisdom and the plans being pursued by many in our industry.\nWe believe when you step back and consider: one, we are building a brand with no peer; two, we are creating a customer experience that cannot be replicated online; and three, we have total control of our brand from concept to customer, you realize what we are building is extremely rare in today’s retail landscape, and, we would argue, will also prove to be very valuable.\nIn closing, we are deeply grateful for our people and partners whose passion and persistence bring our vision and values to life each day, as we pursue our quest to become one of the most admired brands in the world.\nCarpe Diem,\nGary\nGary Friedman\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\nNet revenues in the range of $2.53 to $2.57 billion, representing growth of 5% to 7% on a comparable 52-week vs. 52-week basis. The Company’s net revenue outlook is approximately $50 million lower than its prior expectations due to its decision to delay the opening of its New York Design Gallery (now scheduled for Fall 2018) and the Company’s first Guesthouse (now scheduled for Spring 2019) as a result of the ongoing disruption from the city’s street and infrastructure construction in the Meatpacking District. Additionally, the Company does not plan to launch any new businesses in 2018 outside of RH Hospitality while it remains focused on designing an operating platform that aligns with and amplifies its luxury positioning. Adjusted gross margin in the range of 37.7% to 38.5% and adjusted SG&A as a percentage of revenue in the range of 28.3% to 28.5%. Adjusted operating margin in the range of 9.2% to 10.2%, an increase versus the Company’s prior expectations for adjusted operating margin of 9.0% to 10.0%, due to continued benefits from efforts to architect a simplified and more efficient operating platform and despite the negative impact from the delay of the New York Gallery and Guesthouse. Adjusted net income in the range of $145 to $165 million, up 63% to 85% versus last year, and an increase compared to the Company’s prior guidance range of $125 to $145 million, reflecting benefits from a more efficient operating platform, and a tax rate of approximately 26%. Adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.45 to $6.20 based on diluted shares outstanding of approximately 26.6 million. Net capital expenditures in the range of $75 to $85 million versus $112 million in fiscal 2017. Merchandise inventories in the range of $450 to $475 million, down 10% to 15% versus last year. Free cash flow in excess of $250 million.\nFirst Quarter Outlook\nNet revenues in the range of $555 to $565 million, reflecting an approximate 5 point negative impact from cycling last year’s inventory optimization efforts. Adjusted gross margin in the range of 36.4% to 36.8% and adjusted SG&A as a percentage of revenue in the range of 28.7% to 28.8%. Adjusted operating margin in the range of 7.6% to 8.1%. Adjusted operating income in the range of $42 to $46 million. Adjusted net income in the range of $24 to $27 million. Adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.95 to $1.05 based on diluted shares outstanding of approximately 25.5 million.\nIntermediate and Long Term Targets\nThe Company plans to pivot towards revenue growth in fiscal 2019, by accelerating its disruptive real estate transformation and returning to its product and business expansion strategy, which has been on hold while architecting its new operating platform. Net revenue growth is expected to reaccelerate to a range of 8% to 12%. As the Company continues to gain benefits from its move to membership, a simplified and more efficient operating platform and cycles the current investment drag from its hospitality initiatives, operating margins are now expected to reach the low to mid-teens by 2021.\nQ&A Conference Call Information\nAccompanying this release, RH leadership will host a live question and answer conference call at 2:00 p.m. PT (5:00 p.m. ET). Interested parties may access the call by dialing (866) 394-6658 (United States/Canada) or (706) 679-9188 (International). A live broadcast of the question and answer session conference call will also be available online at the Company’s investor relations website, ir.rh.com . A replay of the question and answer session conference call will be available through April 9, 2018 by dialing (855) 859-2056 or (404) 537-3406 and entering passcode 6199665, as well as on the Company’s investor relations website.\nTax Reform\nThe United States enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) on December 22, 2017. The new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affect RH and, as required, we have included reasonable estimates of the income tax effects of the changes in tax law and tax rate in our fiscal 2017 financial results. Since the Tax Act was passed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we consider the accounting for the transition tax, deferred tax re-measurements, and other items to be provisional as the charge may be adjusted due to changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, guidance that may be issued, and actions we may take as a result of the tax legislation. We expect to finalize our estimates within the one-year measurement period allowed by the SEC. Our provision for income taxes in fiscal 2017 included $7.0 million of income tax expense as a result of the Tax Act, including $6.0 million for the provisional re-measurement of our net deferred tax assets for the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and a $1.0 million charge for our provisional estimate of the transition tax. The provisional tax related impact of tax reform has been excluded from our adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement its condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: adjusted net revenue, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, free cash flow and adjusted operating margin (collectively, “non-GAAP financial measures”). We compute these measures by adjusting the applicable GAAP measures to remove the impact of certain recurring and non-recurring charges and gains and the tax effect of these adjustments. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. The Company believes that they provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company in this press release may be different from the non-GAAP financial measures, including similarly titled measures, used by other companies.\nFor more information on the non-GAAP financial measures, please see the Reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP Financial Measures tables in this press release. These accompanying tables include details on the GAAP financial measures that are most directly comparable to non-GAAP financial measures and the related reconciliations between these financial measures.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis release contains within the meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements related to: our future financial outlook and guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, for the fiscal year 2018 and for intermediate and long term timeframes, including our guidance and outlook with respect to net revenues, adjusted net revenues, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, adjusted gross margin, operating margins, adjusted operating margins, free cash flow, expected tax rate, anticipated diluted shares outstanding, inventories, net capital expenditures and net revenue growth;

[d] Represents the release of the remaining reserve for potential claims regarding anti-dumping duties which we believe have lapsed. The reserve related to potential tariff obligations of one of our foreign suppliers following the U.S. Department of Commerce’s review on the anti-dumping duty order on wooden bedroom furniture from China for the period from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011. [e] Represents charges incurred or the estimated cumulative impact of coupons redeemed in connection with a legal claim alleging that the Company violated California’s Song-Beverly Credit Card Act of 1971 by requesting and recording ZIP codes from customers paying with credit cards. [f] Represents the impairments associated with RH Contemporary Art and RH Kitchen. The impairment related to RH Kitchen is a result of the alignment with the Waterworks Kitchen product line strategy. This resulted in cost of goods sold of $1.0 million which represented impairment of inventory in fiscal 2016. RH Contemporary Art was integrated into the broader RH platform and no longer operates as a separate division. In fiscal 2016, this resulted in cost of goods sold of $1.1 million which represented impairment of inventory, and selling, general and administrative expenses of $10.6 million which represents lease related charges, property and equipment disposals, and donations. In fiscal 2017, an additional lease related charge of $4.4 million was recorded due to the remeasurement of the liability for lease losses for RH Contemporary Art resulting from an update to both the timing and the amount of future estimated lease related cash inflows. [g] Represents a non-cash compensation charges related to a fully vested option grant made to Mr. Friedman in May 2017 and the fully vested option grants made in connection with our acquisition of Waterworks in May 2016.

[k] Represents costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of Waterworks including professional fees. [l] Represents goodwill impairment related to the Waterworks reporting unit.\n[m] Under GAAP, certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash on conversion are required to be separately accounted for as liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer’s non-convertible debt borrowing rate. Accordingly, in accounting for GAAP purposes for the $350 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes that were issued in June 2014 (the “2019 Notes”) and for the $300 million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes that were issued in June and July 2015 (the “2020 Notes”), we separated the 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes into liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components and we are amortizing as debt discount an amount equal to the fair value of the equity components as interest expense on the 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes over their respective terms. The equity components represent the difference between the proceeds from the issuance of the 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes and the fair value of the liability components of the 2019 Notes and 2020 Notes, respectively. Amounts are presented net of interest capitalized for capital projects of $0.2 million and $0.5 million during the three months ended February 3, 2018 and January 27, 2017, respectively. Amounts are presented net of interest capitalized for capital projects of $2.5 million and $2.4 million during the twelve months ended February 3, 2018 and January 27, 2017, respectively. [n] Represents the loss on extinguishment of debt related to the second lien term loan which was repaid in full in October 2017. [o] The adjustment for the three months ended February 3, 2018 is based on an adjusted tax rate of 34.0%, which excludes the impact of tax reform, including the $6.0 million revaluation of the net deferred tax assets and $1.0 million transitional tax, as well as the $5.9 million tax impact associated with the Waterworks reporting unit goodwill impairment. The adjustment for the twelve months ended February 3, 2018 is based on an adjusted tax rate of 34.7%, which is calculated based on the weighted-average fiscal 2017 quarterly adjusted pro forma tax rates and excludes the tax related impact of tax reform and the goodwill impairment, as discussed above. The three and twelve months ended January 28, 2017 assume a normalized tax rate of 39%. [p] Adjusted net income is a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We define adjusted net income as net income, adjusted for the impact of certain non-recurring and other items that we do not consider representative of our underlying operating performance. Adjusted net income is included in this press release because management believes that adjusted net income provides meaningful supplemental information for investors regarding the performance of our business and facilitates a meaningful evaluation of actual results on a comparable basis with historical results. Our management uses this non-GAAP financial measure in order to have comparable financial results to analyze changes in our underlying business from quarter to quarter.
