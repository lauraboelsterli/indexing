    "text": "2 COMMENTS Sears Holdings Corp. announced $540 million in new loan agreements and reported another dismal quarter in which sales fell by nearly a third as the retailer continued to close stores.\nTotal sales fell to $4.4 billion for the three months ending Feb. 3, from $6.1 billion a year earlier. Excluding the closures, sales at existing Sears stores fell 18.1% and 12.2% at Kmart locations for the three months ended Feb. 3. The results contrast with those of other retailers, including Macy’s Inc., Kohl’s Corp. and Nordstrom Inc., all of which reported higher sales for their year-end periods as consumer spending picked up over the holiday season.\nSears swung to a $182 million profit for the period, compared with a loss of $607 million a year ago, helped by a $470 million tax benefit related to the new tax law.\nThe company, which has struggled for years under the leadership of Edward Lampert, a financier who is its chief executive, chairman and largest shareholder, also announced three new loan agreements totaling $540 million, some of which are from entities controlled by Mr. Lampert.\n“We made progress in 2017, with another quarter of year-over-year improvement in our financial result,” Mr. Lampert said. “We also recognize that we need to do more if we are to deliver on our commitment to return to profitability in 2018. Importantly, to ensure our long-term viability, we must substantially improve our sales and gross margin performance, including adjustments to our business model.”\nSears ended the quarter with $336 million in cash and $69 million available on its credit line. Total debt stood at $4.12 billion.\nSears is under pressure to refinance a portion of that debt coming due in October. A failure to do so could tip the retailer into bankruptcy, analysts have said. Sears is on Fitch Ratings Inc.’s list of bonds at risk of default.\nMr. Lampert has for years defied his critics with financial maneuvers, such as a deal reached last year to sell Sears’s Craftsman brand , that have kept the company afloat.\nSears shares, which have fallen more than 70% over the past year, closed at $2.42, on Wednesday down 5%, though they gained in after hours trading.\nWrite to Suzanne Kapner at Suzanne.Kapner@wsj.com",
