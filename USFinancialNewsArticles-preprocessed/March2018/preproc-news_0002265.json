    "text": "DUNN, N.C., March 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Select Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:SLCT), the holding company for Select Bank & Trust, today reported net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $3.2 million and basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.27, compared to net income of $6.8 million and basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.58 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company reported net loss of $2.0 million, and basic and diluted loss per share of $(0.17), compared to net income of $1.6 million and basic and diluted earnings per share of $0.14 for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nEmbedded in the Company’s net income numbers for the year and quarter ended December 31, 2017, are net after tax merger expenses of $1.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively, related to the acquisition of Premara Financial, Inc. and its subsidiary bank, Carolina Premier Bank, which closed in December 2017. In addition, due to the new tax legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017, the Company was required to calculate a “tax re-measurement” for the associated rate change for its deferred taxes. This tax re-calculation resulted in an increase of approximately $2.5 million of income tax expense for the year and fourth quarter of 2017, which directly impacted the Company’s reported results for those periods.\nTotal assets, deposits, and total loans for the Company as of December 31, 2017 were $1.2 billion, $995.0 million, and $982.6 million, respectively, compared to total assets of $846.6 million, total deposits of $679.7 million, and total loans of $677.2 million as of the same date in 2016. The merger represented increases of $278.8 million in total assets, $198.4 million in gross loans, $18.0 million in goodwill and $226.3 million in deposits. Organic growth accounted for $68.7 million in total assets, $107.0 million in gross loans and $89.1 million in deposits.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, return on average assets was 0.35% and return on average equity was 2.93%, compared to 0.81% and 6.61%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nNon-performing loans decreased to $7.0 million at December 31, 2017 from $9.4 million at December 31, 2016. Non-performing loans equaled 0.71% of loans at December 31, 2017, decreasing from 1.02% of loans at December 31, 2016. Foreclosed real estate equaled $1.3 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $599,000 at December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net charge-offs were $944,000, or 0.13% of average loans, compared to net charge offs of $126,000, or 0.02% of average loans in 2016. At December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan losses was $8.8 million, or 0.90% of total loans, as compared to $8.4 million, or 1.24% of total loans, at December 31, 2016.\nNet interest margin was 4.09% and 4.14% for the year and quarter ending December 31, 2017, as compared to 4.06% and 3.98% for the year and quarter ending December 31, 2016.\n“Our strategy has been growth-oriented and efficiency driven, while delivering value to our shareholders,” President and CEO William L. Hedgepeth II said. “We continued that mission in 2017. While our 2017 results were impacted by the change in tax law during the 2017 fourth quarter, the required tax re-measurement is a non-cash flow expense. Ultimately, we expect the reduction in the corporate tax rate will have long-term benefits for our net income and should positively impact our operating performance in the quarters to come.”\nAmong the major highlights of 2017 were the acquisition of Premara Financial, Inc. and the accompanying entry into the Charlotte market and into South Carolina, the opening of a new branch in Wilmington in the Mayfaire district, and the opening of Select Mortgage, a division of Select Bank & Trust.\n“It has been our goal for some time to expand,” Hedgepeth continued, “2017 was a year for growth and expansion. The merger closed on December 15, 2017, and Select has added four banking offices, one in Charlotte and three in the South Carolina communities of Rock Hill, Blacksburg and Six Mile. We expect that the recent merger will allow us to leverage our resources in ways neither bank could achieve on its own. We are also excited about the growth we have already experienced from our new Wilmington office, and we believe adding mortgages to our portfolio of products and services allows us to offer a customer all the financial services they need at their local community bank.”\nSelect Bank & Trust has 18 branch offices in these North Carolina communities: Dunn, Burlington, Charlotte, Clinton, Elizabeth City, Fayetteville, Goldsboro, Greenville, Leland, Lillington, Lumberton, Morehead City, Raleigh, Washington, and Wilmington and in the following South Carolina communities: Blacksburg, Rock Hill and Six Mile.\nImportant Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nT he information as of and for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, as presented is unaudited.
