    "text": "STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish mobile telecoms equipment maker Ericsson is on track to reach its target of at least 10 billion crowns ($1.2 billion) of annual savings by mid-2018, its chief executive said on Wednesday.\nFILE PHOTO: Ericsson Chief Executive Officer Borje Ekholm holds a news conference during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 26, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman/File Photo Ericsson has made sweeping cost cuts and replaced much of its top management to try to turn around a business hit by competition from China’s Huawei and Finland’s Nokia, falling spending by telecoms operators and the hangover from a failed plan to diversify.\n“We will reach the 10 billion well on time,” CEO Borje Ekholm told reporters ahead of the firm’s annual general meeting close to its north Stockholm headquarters.\nEkholm said Ericsson, which is waiting for demand for next-generation mobile networks to increase, was well-placed, having won around half of 5G contracts worldwide so far.\nSweden's mobile telecom gear maker Ericsson CEO Borje Ekholm (L) and proposed new Ericsson's chairman Ronnie Leten attend news conference in Stockholm, Sweden March 28, 2018. REUTERS/Olof Swahnberg “We see a much faster acceleration for 5G than we thought earlier. Maybe not as fast in Europe, but incredibly fast in North America and Asia,” he said.\nThe former boss of high-flying mining gear maker Atlas Copco, Ronnie Leten, is due to take up his post as Ericsson’s chairman on Wednesday. The appointment of Leten, who succeeds Leif Johansson, has boosted investors’ hopes of a recovery at the company.\nFlags with Ericsson logo are pictured outside company's head office in Stockholm, Sweden, October 4 , 2016. TT NEWS AGENCY/Maja Suslin via REUTERS Ekholm said the incoming chairman favored decentralization, clear accountability, and would aim to simplify how the company works.\n“He is a great industry leader who will add a new approach to the firm,” Ekholm said.\nThe fourth quarter of last year was Ericsson’s fifth straight quarter of operating losses. It said in January the cost-cutting program was saving around 6 billion crowns on an annual basis at that time.\nThe company has also pledged to deliver a gross margin of 37-39 percent and an operating margin of 10 percent by 2020. Its fourth quarter gross margin, excluding restructuring charges, was 30 percent, roughly unchanged from the third quarter.\n($1 = 8.2887 Swedish crowns)\nReporting by Olof Swahnberg and Helena Soderpalm; Editing by Niklas Pollard and Mark Potter\n ",
