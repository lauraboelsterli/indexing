Going forward, we will continue to seek to use our demonstrated credit expertise and the benefits of the Ares platform to make quality investments that we believe will provide attractive returns and may benefit from potential increases in short term interest rates.”\nPORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITY\nAs of December 31, 2017, the fair value of ACSF’s portfolio totaled $229.2 million and was comprised of $170.9 million, or 74.6%, of first lien floating rate loans, $14.4 million, or 6.3%, of second lien floating rate loans (collectively, the “Loan Portfolio”) and $43.8 million or 19.1% of CLO equity (the “CLO Portfolio” and, together with the Loan Portfolio, the “Investment Portfolio”).
