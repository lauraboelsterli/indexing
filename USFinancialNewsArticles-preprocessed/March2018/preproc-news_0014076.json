(NASDAQ:EVOK), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on treatments for gastrointestinal (GI) diseases, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nDave Gonyer, R.Ph., President and CEO, stated, “2017 was a critical year for Evoke as we successfully completed our pivotal comparative exposure pharmacokinetic (PK) study for Gimoti™, an important component of our 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (NDA) for submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). From the results of the PK trial and recent FDA communications, we were able to confirm the proposed dose for women to be submitted in the NDA. The sex-based NDA submission strategy will allow us to seek approval for a product that is specific to the needs of 80% of the patients who suffer from symptoms of diabetic gastroparesis. We continue to work diligently to ensure that we submit a comprehensive NDA next quarter.”\nMr. Gonyer continued, “Financially, we remain conservative with our expenditures and reiterate that we have cash runway into October 2018. We are actively evaluating multiple strategic pathways forward for Gimoti, including debt financing and other potential partnerships.”\nFourth Quarter and Year End Financial Review\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, net loss was approximately $308,000, or $0.02 per basic share, compared to a net loss of approximately $1.5 million, or $0.12 per basic share for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the net loss was approximately $12.2 million, or $0.82 per basic share. This compares to a net loss of approximately $10.7 million, or $1.15 per basic share for 2016.\nResearch and development expenses totaled approximately $1.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to approximately $1.5 million for 2016. For the full year 2017, research and development expenses were approximately $7.1 million compared to approximately $7.0 million in the prior year.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, general and administrative expenses were approximately $1.0 million compared with approximately $822,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, general and administrative expenses were approximately $4.1 million versus approximately $3.6 million for the full year of 2016.\nTotal operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were approximately $2.7 million, compared to total operating expenses of approximately $2.3 million for 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, total operating expenses were approximately $11.2 million compared to $10.5 million for the full year of 2016.\nIncluded in net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was a gain of approximately $2.3 million due to the change in the fair value of the warrant liability. For the year ended December 31, 2017, there was a net loss due to the change in the fair value of the warrant liability of approximately $1.0 million. The warrant liability is subject to remeasurement at each reporting period and we recognize any change in the fair value of the warrant liability in the statement of operations. We anticipate that the value of the warrants could fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuation could have a material impact on our financial statements from quarter to quarter and year to year.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were approximately $7.7 million.\nConference Call and Webcast\nEvoke will hold a conference call on Wednesday, March 7, 2018 at 4:30 pm ET to discuss the results.

Actual results may differ from those set forth in this press release due to the risks and uncertainties inherent in Evoke's business, including, without limitation: the FDA may disagree that the existing safety database and efficacy data is sufficient to allow an NDA submission and approval, including risks associated with C max falling below the bioequivalence range in the comparative exposure PK trial and the proposed duration of use for Gimoti being shorter as compared to the maximum approved dosing duration for the referenced listed drug, Reglan Tablets, and the available safety database supporting such duration; the FDA may not agree with Evoke's interpretation of the results of clinical trials of Gimoti; the FDA may require additional evidence of sex-based PK differences of Gimoti before making a final decision on Gimoti; risks associated with the size, cost and duration of a post-marketing safety trials; later developments with the FDA that may be inconsistent with the already completed pre-NDA meetings; the inherent risks of clinical development of Gimoti; Evoke is entirely dependent on the success of Gimoti, and Evoke cannot be certain that it will be able to submit an NDA for Gimoti or obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize Gimoti; Evoke will require substantial additional funding to conduct any new trials required by the FDA, and may be unable to raise capital when needed, including to fund ongoing operations; Evoke may not be able to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights; and other risks detailed in Evoke's prior press releases and in the periodic reports it files with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
