    "text": "Lamar Peters scored 24 points, and No. 7 seed Mississippi State held off No. 10 seed LSU 80-77 in the second round of the SEC tournament Thursday night in St. Louis.\nThe Bulldogs (22-10) will face second-seeded Tennessee in the quarterfinals Friday. The Tigers, who had beaten Mississippi State 78-57 in the regular-season finale for both teams last Saturday in Baton Rouge, La., fell to 17-14.\nQuinndary Weatherspoon and Nick Weatherspoon scored 15 points each for the Bulldogs. Aric Holman had 11 points and 12 rebounds.\nSEC All-Freshman point guard Tremont Waters, who played with a plastic mask on his face to protect a broken nose suffered in practice Monday, scored a game-high 28 points to lead the Tigers. Daryl Edwards scored 11 and Brandon Rachal had 10.\nWaters scored LSU’s first five points of the second half and the Tigers quickly reduced a 16-point halftime deficit to 10.\nMSU extended the lead to 56-42 before Edwards scored nine points to help LSU get within 66-62.\nThe Tigers got within two points before Peters’ season-high fifth 3-pointer and a layup by Nick Weatherspoon gave the Bulldogs a 73-66 lead with five minutes remaining.\nLSU went scoreless for three minutes before Skylar Mays’ layup ended the drought and cut the deficit to 73-68 with 2:56 left.\nBoth teams made a free throw before Nick Weatherspoon made two free throws to give MSU a 76-69 lead with 1:34 left.\nAfter a Waters layup, Holman made two free throws to give the Bulldogs a seven-point lead with 34 seconds left.\nMays made a 3-pointer with 22 seconds left and Rachal stole the ball from Peters, leading to Waters’ 3-pointer that cut MSU’s lead to 78-77 with nine seconds left.\nThe Bulldogs broke the press and Peters fed Nick Weatherspoon for a dunk with one second left. Rachal’s desperation 3-pointer missed.\nPeters made three 3-pointers and Nick Weatherspoon made one as MSU jumped to an 18-8 lead.\nWaters answered with two 3-pointers and Brandon Sampson made one as LSU got within 22-18.\nPeters made another 3-pointer and the Bulldogs rebuilt the lead to 33-21.\nAfter Sampson made two free throws, Tyson Carter made a 3-pointer and Holman added two 3-pointers as MSU took a 45-29 halftime lead.\n—Field Level Media\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
