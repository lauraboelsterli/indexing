    "text": "11:06 AM EDT \nThe Mega Millions jackpot numbers were drawn and it appears there was only one winning ticket. \nNo one has matched the numbers for the Mega Millions game since January , letting the jackpot climb to $521 million. The lone winning lottery ticket was sold in New Jersey, though no one has claimed it yet. \nThe winning Mega Millions ticket was sold at a Lukoil station in Riverdale, N.J., in Morris County, ABC reported . Two other winning Mega Millions tickets were sold in Ohio and Texas, which matched the five white balls for $1 million prize each, according to Mega Millions . \nThe Mega Millions jackpot win comes six years to the day from the record-breaking $656 million Mega Millions was won. The March 30 prize is the fourth-largest jackpot in Mega Millions history. \nThe winning numbers are 11, 28, 31, 46 and 59, with a Mega Ball of 1. \nIf you didnâ€™t purchase the winning Mega Millions ticket, the jackpot resets to $40 million on April 3.
