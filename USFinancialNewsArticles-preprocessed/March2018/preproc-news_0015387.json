Additionally, for each share of common stock (or common stock equivalent) purchased, the investor will receive an unregistered warrant to purchase up to 1,581,000 shares of common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $1.14 per share, shall be exercisable immediately following the issuance date of the warrants and will expire 5.5 years from the issuance date.\nH.C.

The closing of the offering is expected to take place on or about March 9, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nThe shares described above (but not the warrants or the shares underlying the warrants) are being offered pursuant to a \"shelf\" registration statement (File No. 333-202702) which became effective on March 19, 2015. Such shares may be offered only by means of a prospectus, including a prospectus supplement, forming a part of the effective registration statement.

There shall not be any offer, solicitation of an offer to buy, or sale of securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offering, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.\nAbout Superconductor Technologies Inc.

Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are inherently subject to uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. These factors and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our expectation regarding the closing of the offering, our limited cash and a history of losses; our need to materially grow our revenues from commercial operations and/or to raise additional capital (which financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all) in the very near future, before cash reserves are depleted (which reserves, prior to the closing of this offering, are expected to be sufficient through the first quarter of 2018), to implement our current business plan and maintain our viability; the performance and use of our equipment to produce wire in accordance with our timetable; overcoming technical challenges in attaining milestones to develop and manufacture commercial lengths of our HTS wire; the possibility of delays in customer evaluation and acceptance of our HTS wire; the limited number of potential customers and customer pressures on the selling prices of our products; the limited number of suppliers for some of our components and our HTS wire; there being no significant backlog from quarter to quarter; our market being characterized by rapidly advancing technology; the impact of competitive products, technologies and pricing; manufacturing capacity constraints and difficulties; the impact of any financing activity on the level of our stock price; the dilutive impact of any issuances of securities to raise capital; the steps required to maintain the listing of our common stock with a U.S. national securities exchange and the impact on the liquidity and trading price of our common stock if we fail to maintain such listing; the cost and uncertainty from compliance with environmental regulations; and local, regional, and national and international economic conditions and events and the impact they may have on us and our customers.\nForward-looking statements can be affected by many other factors, including, those described in the \"Business\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" sections of STI's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and in STI's other public filings. These documents are available online at STI's website, www.suptech.com , or through the SEC's website, www.sec.gov . Forward-looking statements are based on information presently available to senior management, and STI has not assumed any duty to update any forward-looking statements.\nContact: Investor Relations Contact\nMoriah Shilton or Kirsten Chapman\nLHA\n+1-415-433-3777\ninvest@suptech.com\nSource:Superconductor Technologies Inc.",
