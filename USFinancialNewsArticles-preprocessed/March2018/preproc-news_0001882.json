    "text": "LAS VEGAS, March 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Caesars Entertainment Corporation (NASDAQ: CZR) today reported fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results as summarized in the discussion below, which highlights certain GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures on a consolidated basis. As of October 6, 2017, Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, Inc. (now known as CEOC, LLC \"CEOC\") emerged from Bankruptcy and Caesars completed the merger with Caesars Acquisition Company (\"CAC\").\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nNet revenues increased to $1.90 billion due to the inclusion of CEOC. Same-store revenues remained flat year-over-year at $1.96 billion. Net income was $2.00 billion, driven by a tax benefit of $2.03 billion relating to U.S. tax reform and CEOC's emergence from Bankruptcy. Adjusted EBITDAR improved to $491 million and same-store adjusted EBITDAR of $505 million exceeded previously communicated expectations. Our Las Vegas RevPAR was essentially flat year-over-year at $124, while Las Vegas Strip market RevPAR declined 3%. Marketing expense was reduced by 4% year-over-year, resulting in a 52 basis-point improvement in marketing efficiency.\nFull Year Highlights\nNet revenues increased to $4.85 billion due to the inclusion of CEOC. Same-store net revenues remained flat at $8.12 billion. Net loss was $375 million. A $2.00 billion tax benefit relating to U.S. tax reform and CEOC's emergence from Bankruptcy was offset by $2.03 billion in restructuring expenses related to CEOC's emergence and a $232 million loss on debt extinguishment. Adjusted EBITDAR improved to $1.4 billion and same-store adjusted EBITDAR of $2.20 billion exceeded previously communicated expectations. Las Vegas RevPAR improved 3.9% to $132 driven by improved rates from additional renovated rooms and overall strength in hospitality management.\n\"Caesars Entertainment delivered another year of solid operating performance with revenue growth across all segments versus 2016, operating income margin expansion, and same-store EBITDAR margin up 59 basis points year-over-year to the highest level in more than a decade,\" said Mark Frissora, President and CEO of Caesars Entertainment. \"Same-store gaming revenues increased company-wide for the full year despite unfavorable hold of approximately $80 million. Non-gaming revenues and Las Vegas RevPAR increased for the full year, driven by room renovations and overall strength of our hospitality assets. In 2018, we will continue to invest in our core business while pursuing attractive growth opportunities, including our acquisition of Centaur Gaming.\"\nNote that certain additional non-GAAP financial measures have been added to highlight the results of the company including CEOC. Due to the timing of CEOC's emergence, Caesars results do not include CEOC until October 6, 2017. \"Same-Store\" results above and below include CEOC as if its results were consolidated during all periods, but remove the now deconsolidated Horseshoe Baltimore and Ohio Managed properties from all periods presented. See the tables at the end of this press release for the reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP presentations. GAAP and Same-Store results include CAC for all periods presented because the merger was accounted for as a combination of companies under common control. For same-store result reconciliations by region, see the historical information supplement in the Investor Relations section of www.caesars.com .\nSummary Financial Data\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, the results of CEOC and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries were not consolidated with CZR from January 15, 2015 until October 6, 2017. Additionally, CZR deconsolidated the results of its Horseshoe Baltimore property in the third quarter of 2017, and exited a management relationship with certain properties in Ohio (\"the Ohio Properties\") in 2016, accounting for many of the fluctuations in the tables below.\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nCEC\nEnterprise Wide\nSame-store\n2017\n2016\nChange\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data)\nCEC\nCEOC\nLess:\nBaltimore\nEnterprise\nWide\nSame-\nstore\nCEC\nCEOC\nLess:\nBaltimore\nEnterprise\nWide\nSame-\nstore\n$\n%\n$\n%\nCasino revenues\n$\n1,248\n$\n44\n$\n—\n$\n1,292\n$\n544\n$\n832\n$\n74\n$\n1,302\n$\n704\n129.4%\n$\n(10)\n(0.8)%\nNet revenues\n1,901\n62\n—\n1,963\n949\n1,098\n78\n1,969\n952\n100.3%\n(6)\n(0.3)%\nIncome from operations (a)\n153\n10\n—\n163\n95\n135\n5\n225\n58\n61.1%\n(62)\n(27.6)%\nRestructuring and support expenses\n321\n12,328\n—\n12,649\n(425)\n(47)\n—\n(472)\n746\n*\n13,121\n*\nOther income\n78\n—\n—\n78\n—\n4\n—\n4\n78\n*\n74\n*\nIncome/(loss) from continuing operations, net of income taxes (a)\n2,001\n12,329\n—\n14,330\n(495)\n37\n(2)\n(456)\n2,496\n*\n14,786\n*\nDiscontinued operations, net of income taxes\n—\n17\n—\n17\n29\n(1)\n—\n28\n(29)\n(100.0)%\n(11)\n(39.3)%\nNet income/(loss) (a)\n2,001\n12,346\n—\n14,347\n(466)\n36\n(2)\n(428)\n2,467\n*\n14,775\n*\nNet income/(loss) attributable to Caesars (a)\n2,001\n12,346\n—\n14,347\n(463)\n34\n—\n(429)\n2,464\n*\n14,776\n*\nBasic earnings/(loss) per share\n3.01\n18.56\n—\n21.57\n(3.15)\n0.23\n—\n(2.92)\n6.16\n*\n24.49\n*\nDiluted earnings/(loss) per share\n2.48\n15.18\n—\n17.66\n(3.15)\n0.23\n—\n(2.92)\n5.63\n*\n20.58\n*\nProperty EBITDAR (1)\n516\n14\n—\n530\n273\n265\n12\n526\n243\n89.0%\n4\n0.8%\nAdjusted EBITDAR (1)\n491\n14\n—\n505\n250\n269\n14\n505\n241\n96.4%\n—\n—%\nAdjusted EBITDAR Margin (1)\n25.8%\n22.6%\n—\n25.7%\n26.3%\n24.5%\n17.9%\n25.6%\nYear Ended December 31,\nCEC\nEnterprise Wide\nSame-store\n2017\n2016\nChange\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data)\nCEC\nCEOC\nLess:\nBaltimore\nEnterprise\nWide\nSame-\nstore\nCEC\nCEOC\nLess:\nBaltimore\nEnterprise\nWide\nSame-\nstore\n$\n%\n$\n%\nCasino revenues\n$\n2,865\n$\n2,558\n$\n178\n$\n5,245\n$\n2,177\n$\n3,373\n$\n309\n$\n5,241\n$\n688\n31.6%\n$\n4\n0.1%\nNet revenues\n4,852\n3,454\n185\n8,121\n3,877\n4,503\n322\n8,058\n975\n25.1%\n63\n0.8%\nIncome from operations (a)\n532\n594\n17\n1,109\n227\n718\n36\n909\n305\n134.4%\n200\n22.0%\nGain on deconsolidation of subsidiary\n30\n—\n—\n30\n—\n—\n—\n—\n30\n*\n30\n*\nRestructuring and support expenses\n(2,028)\n12,246\n—\n10,218\n(5,729)\n(223)\n—\n(5,952)\n3,701\n64.6%\n16,170\n*\nOther income/(loss)\n95\n18\n—\n113\n(29)\n47\n—\n18\n124\n*\n95\n*\nIncome/(loss) from continuing operations, net of income taxes (a)\n(382)\n12,660\n(13)\n12,291\n(6,457)\n301\n6\n(6,162)\n6,075\n94.1%\n18,453\n*\nDiscontinued operations, net of income taxes\n—\n17\n—\n17\n3,380\n—\n—\n3,380\n(3,380)\n(100.0)%\n(3,363)\n(99.5)%\nNet income/(loss) (a)\n(382)\n12,677\n(13)\n12,308\n(3,077)\n301\n6\n(2,782)\n2,695\n87.6%\n15,090\n*\nNet income/(loss) attributable to Caesars (a)\n(375)\n12,671\n(6)\n12,302\n(3,048)\n292\n2\n(2,758)\n2,673\n87.7%\n15,060\n*\nBasic earnings/(loss) per share\n(1.35)\n45.46\n(0.02)\n44.14\n(20.85)\n2.00\n0.01\n(18.86)\n19.50\n93.5%\n63.00\n*\nDiluted earnings/(loss) per share\n(1.35)\n45.46\n(0.02)\n44.14\n(20.85)\n2.00\n0.01\n(18.86)\n19.50\n93.5%\n63.00\n*\nProperty EBITDAR (1)\n1,428\n923\n37\n2,314\n1,140\n1,171\n65\n2,246\n288\n25.3%\n68\n3.0%\nAdjusted EBITDAR (1)\n1,357\n885\n39\n2,203\n1,070\n1,137\n69\n2,138\n287\n26.8%\n65\n3.0%\nAdjusted EBITDAR Margin (1)\n28.0%\n25.6%\n21.1%\n27.1%\n27.6%\n25.2%\n21.4%\n26.5%\nSee \"Footnotes to Tables\" following Balance Sheet and Other Items later in this release.\n(a) Fourth quarter and full year 2017 figures include depreciation and interest expense related to leased assets under a failed sale-leaseback financing obligation and may not compare with prior year results. This obligation is related to the real estate assets that were transferred to VICI Properties and leased back to CEOC LLC pursuant to lease agreements in connection with CEOC's emergence from bankruptcy and in connection with the sale of the real estate assets of Harrah's Las Vegas to VICI Properties in December 2017. Interest expense and depreciation associated with the failed sale-leaseback assets are correlated with the value assigned to the assets. When cash proceeds are exchanged, a failed sale-leaseback financing obligation is equal to the proceeds received for the assets that are sold and leased back. However, in the absence of cash proceeds, the value of the financing obligation recognized was determined to be the fair value of the leased real estate, which was estimated based on the future lease payments over 35 years using an imputed discount rate of 8.5%. The discount rate was determined based on the tax advantaged status and lower cost of capital associated with a REIT. Depreciation expense and interest expense relating to the leased assets was $120 million and $189 million for both the quarter and year For an illustration of the failed sale-leaseback impact on certain financial statement line items, see the supplemental tables in the appendix.\nFinancial Results\nPost the emergence of CEOC on October 6, we reassessed our segment reporting, which was historically broken out by credit structure. We view each casino property as an operating segment and aggregate such casino properties into three regionally-focused reportable segments: (i) Las Vegas, (ii) Other U.S. and (iii) All Other, which is consistent with how we manage the business. These segments include the following properties:\nLas Vegas\nOther U.S.\nAll Other\nBally's Las Vegas\nBally's Atlantic City (2)\nManagement Companies\nOther\nCaesars Palace Las Vegas (2)\nCaesars Atlantic City (2)\nCaesars Cairo\nCaesars Interactive Entertainment\nThe Cromwell\nHarrah's Atlantic City\nCaesars Windsor\nFlamingo Las Vegas\nHarrah's Council Bluffs (2)\nHarrah's Ak-Chin\nHarrah's Las Vegas (2)\nHarrah's Gulf Coast (2)\nHarrah's Cherokee\nThe LINQ Hotel & Casino\nHarrah's Joliet (2)\nHarrah's Cherokee Valley River\nParis Las Vegas\nHarrah's Lake Tahoe (2)\nHarrah's Resort Southern California\nPlanet Hollywood Resort & Casino\nHarrah's Laughlin\nHorseshoe Baltimore (1)\nRio All-Suites Hotel & Casino\nHarrah's Louisiana Downs (2)\nThe London Clubs Cairo-Ramses\nLINQ Promenade/High Roller\nHarrah's Metropolis (2)\nHarrah's New Orleans\nInternational\nHarrah's North Kansas City (2)\nAlea Glasgow\nHarrah's Philadelphia\nAlea Nottingham\nHarrah's Reno (2)\nThe Casino at the Empire\nHarveys Lake Tahoe (2)\nEmerald Safari\nHorseshoe Baltimore (until Q3) (1)\nManchester235\nHorseshoe Bossier City (2)\nPlayboy Club London\nHorseshoe Council Bluffs (2)\nRendezvous Brighton\nHorseshoe Hammond (2)\nRendezvous Southend-on-Sea\nHorseshoe Southern Indiana (2)\nThe Sportsman\nHorseshoe Tunica (2)\nTunica Roadhouse (2)\n(1)\nHorseshoe Baltimore is 41% owned, and was deconsolidated and held as an equity-method investment effective August 31, 2017.\n(2)\nLand and buildings owned by VICI Properties, Inc.\nThe results of each reportable segment presented below are consistent with the way management assesses these results and allocates resources, which is a consolidated view that adjusts for the effect of certain transactions between reportable segments within Caesars, as described below. \"All Other\" includes managed, international and other properties as well as parent, consolidating, and other adjustments to reconcile to consolidated Caesars results. In the U.S. GAAP consolidation tables below, the inclusion of CEOC LLC's results is the primary driver of year-over-year fluctuation.\nNet Revenues - U.S. GAAP Consolidation\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nPercent\nYears Ended December 31,\nPercent\n(Dollars in millions)\n2017\n2016\nFavorable/\n(Unfavorable)\n2017\n2016\nFavorable/\n(Unfavorable)\nLas Vegas\n$\n858\n$\n645\n33.0%\n$\n2,897\n$\n2,625\n10.4%\nOther U.S.\n890\n287\n*\n1,756\n1,205\n45.7%\nAll Other\n153\n17\n*\n199\n47\n*\nCaesars\n$\n1,901\n$\n949\n100.3%\n$\n4,852\n$\n3,877\n25.1%\nIncome/(Loss) from Operations - U.S. GAAP Consolidation\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nPercent\nYears Ended December 31,\nPercent\n(Dollars in millions)\n2017\n2016\nFavorable/\n(Unfavorable)\n2017\n2016\nFavorable/\n(Unfavorable)\nLas Vegas\n$\n133\n$\n126\n5.6%\n$\n546\n$\n526\n3.8%\nOther U.S.\n74\n28\n164.3%\n198\n163\n21.5%\nAll Other\n(54)\n(59)\n8.5%\n(212)\n(462)\n54.1%\nCaesars\n$\n153\n$\n95\n61.1%\n$\n532\n$\n227\n134.4%\nNet Income/(Loss) - U.S. GAAP Consolidation\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nPercent\nYears Ended December 31,\nPercent\n(Dollars in millions)\n2017\n2016\nFavorable/\n(Unfavorable)\n2017\n2016\nFavorable/\n(Unfavorable)\nLas Vegas\n$\n78\n$\n122\n(36.1)%\n$\n481\n$\n506\n(4.9)%\nOther U.S.\n(237)\n21\n*\n(112)\n133\n*\nAll Other\n2,160\n(609)\n*\n(751)\n(3,716)\n79.8%\nCaesars\n$\n2,001\n$\n(466)\n*\n$\n(382)\n$\n(3,077)\n87.6%\nProperty EBITDAR (1) - U.S. GAAP Consolidation\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nPercent\nYears Ended December 31,\nPercent\n(Dollars in millions)\n2017\n2016\nFavorable/\n(Unfavorable)\n2017\n2016\nFavorable/\n(Unfavorable)\nLas Vegas\n$\n283\n$\n217\n30.4%\n$\n991\n$\n878\n12.9%\nOther U.S.\n194\n52\n*\n386\n253\n52.6%\nAll Other\n39\n4\n*\n51\n9\n*\nCaesars\n$\n516\n$\n273\n89.0%\n$\n1,428\n$\n1,140\n25.3%\nAdjusted EBITDAR (1) - U.S. GAAP Consolidation\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nPercent\nYears Ended December 31,\nPercent\n(Dollars in millions)\n2017\n2016\nFavorable/\n(Unfavorable)\n2017\n2016\nFavorable/\n(Unfavorable)\nLas Vegas\n$\n288\n$\n219\n31.5%\n$\n1,000\n$\n881\n13.5%\nOther U.S.\n200\n53\n*\n394\n259\n52.1%\nAll Other\n3\n(22)\n*\n(37)\n(70)\n47.1%\nCaesars\n$\n491\n$\n250\n96.4%\n$\n1,357\n$\n1,070\n26.8%\nCash and Available Revolver Capacity\nSummary of Cash and Revolver Capacity\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2017\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n2,558\nRevolver capacity\n1,200\nRevolver capacity drawn or committed to letters of credit\n(50)\nTotal\n$\n3,708\nFootnotes to Tables\n*\nNot meaningful.\n(1)\nSee the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures discussion later in this release for a reconciliation of Property EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR.\nSame-Store Results\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, the results of CEOC and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries were not consolidated with Caesars from January 15, 2015 until October 6, 2017. Additionally, Caesars deconsolidated the results of its Horseshoe Baltimore property in the third quarter of 2017, and exited a management relationship with certain properties in Ohio (\"the Ohio Properties\") in 2016, causing material fluctuations between year-over-year results. We have provided tables below that includes CEOC and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries in all periods, and excludes the results of the Horseshoe Baltimore property and the Ohio Properties in all periods. GAAP and Same-Store results include CAC for all periods presented because the merger was accounted for as a combination of companies under common control. The intent of this information is to illustrate certain comparable results in the current consolidation structure.\nSame-Store Net Revenues\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nPercent\nYears Ended December 31,\nPercent\n(Dollars in millions)\n2017\n2016\nFavorable/\n( Unfavorable)\n2017\n2016\nFavorable/\n(Unfavorable)\nLas Vegas\n$\n873\n$\n908\n(3.9)%\n$\n3,635\n$\n3,617\n0.5%\nOther U.S.\n930\n905\n2.8%\n3,871\n3,831\n1.0%\nAll Other\n160\n156\n2.6%\n615\n610\n0.8%\nCaesars Same-Store\n$\n1,963\n$\n1,969\n(0.3)%\n$\n8,121\n$\n8,058\n0.8%\nSame-store net revenue declined $6 million, or 0.3%, to $1.96 billion in the fourth quarter, as Other U.S. regional revenue improvement of 2.8% was offset by approximately $29 million of unfavorable year-over-year hold primarily at Caesars Palace and a challenging environment in Las Vegas post October 1. Hold impact is an estimate, based on historical win percentages and may vary +/- $2.5 million. The impact of hold on revenue was unfavorable to our expectation by $10 million in Q4 2017.\nFull year same-store net revenues improved $63 million, or 0.8% over 2016, driven by strong returns on investments in room renovations and other non-gaming initiatives in the Las Vegas region. Improved slot volumes drove an increase to overall net revenue in the Other U.S. region. The improvements were offset by $80 million of unfavorable hold versus the prior year. The impact of hold on revenue was unfavorable to our expectation by $37 million in 2017.\nSame-Store Income/(Loss) from Operations\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nPercent\nYears Ended December 31,\nPercent\n(Dollars in millions)\n2017\n2016\nFavorable/\n(Unfavorable)\n2017\n2016\nFavorable/\n(Unfavorable)\nLas Vegas\n$\n138\n$\n201\n(31.3)%\n$\n748\n$\n785\n(4.7)%\nOther U.S.\n80\n128\n(37.5)%\n614\n648\n(5.2)%\nAll Other\n(55)\n(104)\n47.1%\n(253)\n(524)\n51.7%\nCaesars Same-Store\n$\n163\n$\n225\n(27.6)%\n$\n1,109\n$\n909\n22.0%\nIncome from operations declined $62 million, or 27.6% in the fourth quarter versus the prior year. The decline was primarily due to the inclusion of $120 million of depreciation expense associated with the failed sale-leaseback accounting treatment of the assets leased from VICI. The failed sale-leaseback accounting results in us recording depreciation expense and interest expense associated with the finance obligation in excess of our rental payments. We explain this in more detail in our form 10-K. $45 million related to Caesars Palace, $74 million related to the Other U.S. Region, and $1 million related to the All Other Region.\nSame-store income from operations was $1.1 billion for the full year 2017, an increase of $200 million over 2016. The improvements were primarily driven by the operational performance of the core business. Additionally, the $120 million of depreciation expense associated with the assets leased from VICI was offset by one-time share-based compensation relating to the sale of the CIE Social Mobile Games business in 2016.\nSame-Store Adjusted EBITDAR\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nPercent\nYears Ended December 31,\nPercent\n(Dollars in millions)\n2017\n2016\nFavorable/\n(Unfavorable)\n2017\n2016\nFavorable/\n(Unfavorable)\nLas Vegas\n$\n294\n$\n328\n(10.4)%\n$\n1,290\n$\n1,258\n2.5%\nOther U.S.\n207\n195\n6.2%\n922\n914\n0.9%\nAll Other\n4\n(18)\n*\n(9)\n(34)\n73.5%\nCaesars Same-Store\n$\n505\n$\n505\n—%\n$\n2,203\n$\n2,138\n3.0%\nIn the fourth quarter, same-store adjusted EBITDAR was flat. Strength in Other U.S. Regional gaming, improvement in our London business, and reductions in operating expenses were offset by $30 million of unfavorable year-over-year hold and softness due to the October 1 tragedy in Las Vegas. The impact of hold on adjusted EBITDAR was unfavorable to our expectation by $10 million in Q4 2017.\nFull year same-store adjusted EBITDAR improved in all segments. While non-gaming operations and efficiencies contributed most meaningfully to Las Vegas, the improvement in Other U.S. Regional gaming volume in the second half of 2017 outperformed 2016. Adjusted EBITDAR was negatively impacted by $34 million of lower-than-expected hold in 2017, but $65 million on a year-over-year comparison. The hold volatility was isolated to baccarat play in Las Vegas and London. The impact of hold on EBITDAR was less than its impact on revenue due to reductions in related casino expenses, such as taxes and discounts.\nConference Call Information\nCaesars Entertainment Corporation (NASDAQ: CZR) will host a conference call at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time Wednesday, March 7, 2018, to discuss its fourth quarter results, certain forward-looking information and other matters related to Caesars Entertainment Corporation, including certain financial and other information.

OF NET INCOME/(LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION\nTO PROPERTY EBITDAR AND ADJUSTED EBITDAR\nProperty earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDAR\") is presented as a measure of the Company's performance. Property EBITDAR is defined as revenues less property operating expenses and is comprised of net income/(loss) before (i) interest expense, net of interest capitalized and interest income, (ii) income tax provision, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) corporate expenses, and (v) certain items that the Company does not consider indicative of its ongoing operating performance at an operating property level. As a result of the sale of the SMG Business, we have determined that CIE stock-based compensation expense should be excluded from Property EBITDAR as management no longer considers such expense to be indicative of Caesars Entertainment's ongoing consolidated or segment operating performance. Therefore, Property EBITDAR has been recast for prior periods to be consistent to the current year presentation.\nIn evaluating Property EBITDAR you should be aware that, in the future, the Company may incur expenses that are the same or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The presentation of Property EBITDAR should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or unexpected items.\nProperty EBITDAR is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net income/(loss) as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Property EBITDAR may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies within the industry. Property EBITDAR is included because management uses Property EBITDAR to measure performance and allocate resources, and believes that Property EBITDAR provides investors with additional information consistent with that used by management.\nAdjusted EBITDAR is defined as EBITDAR further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash and other items as exhibited in the following reconciliation, and is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company's performance. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDAR provides investors with additional information and allows a better understanding of the results of operational activities separate from the financial impact of decisions made for the long-term benefit of the Company. In addition, compensation of management is in part determined by reference to certain of such financial information. As a result, we believe this supplemental information is useful to investors who are trying to understand the results of the Company.\nBecause not all companies use identical calculations, the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAR may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following tables reconcile net income/(loss) attributable to the companies presented to Property EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR for the periods indicated.\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\nRECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME/(LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION\nTO PROPERTY EBITDAR AND ADJUSTED EBITDAR\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2016\n(In millions)\nLas Vegas\nOther U.S.\nAll Other\nTotal CEC\nLas Vegas\nOther U.S.\nAll Other\nTotal CEC\nNet income/(loss) attributable to company\n$\n78\n$\n(237)\n$\n2,160\n$\n2,001\n$\n122\n$\n23\n$\n(608)\n$\n(463)\nNet income/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n(2)\n(1)\n(3)\nNet (income)/loss from discontinued operations\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n(29)\n(29)\nIncome tax (benefit)/provision\n—\n(2)\n(2,027)\n(2,029)\n—\n—\n14\n14\nRestructuring and support expenses (a)\n—\n177\n(498)\n(321)\n—\n—\n425\n425\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n—\n1\n215\n216\n—\n—\n—\n—\nOther income/(losses)\n(2)\n(1)\n(75)\n(78)\n(1)\n—\n1\n—\nInterest expense\n57\n136\n171\n364\n5\n7\n139\n151\nIncome/(loss) from operations\n133\n74\n(54)\n153\n126\n28\n(59)\n95\nDepreciation and amortization\n143\n119\n18\n280\n88\n24\n—\n112\nOther operating costs (b)\n7\n1\n2\n10\n3\n—\n9\n12\nCorporate expense\n—\n—\n73\n73\n—\n—\n53\n53\nCIE stock-based compensation\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n1\n1\nProperty EBITDAR\n$\n283\n$\n194\n$\n39\n$\n516\n$\n217\n$\n52\n$\n4\n$\n273\nCorporate expense\n—\n—\n(73)\n(73)\n—\n—\n(53)\n(53)\nStock-based compensation expense (c)\n2\n2\n12\n16\n1\n—\n9\n10\nOther items (e)\n3\n4\n25\n32\n1\n1\n18\n20\nAdjusted EBITDAR\n$\n288\n$\n200\n$\n3\n$\n491\n$\n219\n$\n53\n$\n(22)\n$\n250\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION\nRECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME/(LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO CAESARS ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION\nTO PROPERTY EBITDAR AND ADJUSTED EBITDAR\nYear Ended December 31, 2017\nYear Ended December 31, 2016\n(In millions)\nLas Vegas\nOther U.S.\nAll Other\nTotal CEC\nLas Vegas\nOther U.S.\nAll Other\nTotal CEC\nNet income/(loss) attributable to company\n$\n481\n$\n(105)\n$\n(751)\n$\n(375)\n$\n506\n$\n129\n$\n(3,683)\n$\n(3,048)\nNet income/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n—\n(7)\n—\n(7)\n—\n4\n(33)\n(29)\nNet (income)/loss from discontinued operations\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n(3,380)\n(3,380)\nIncome tax (benefit)/provision\n—\n(2)\n(1,993)\n(1,995)\n(1)\n—\n328\n327\nGain on deconsolidation of subsidiary\n—\n(30)\n—\n(30)\n—\n—\n—\n—\nRestructuring and support expenses (a)\n—\n177\n1,851\n2,028\n—\n—\n5,729\n5,729\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\n4\n13\n215\n232\n—\n—\n—\n—\nOther income/(losses)\n(4)\n(1)\n(90)\n(95)\n—\n—\n29\n29\nInterest expense\n65\n153\n556\n774\n21\n30\n548\n599\nIncome/(loss) from operations\n546\n198\n(212)\n532\n526\n163\n(462)\n227\nDepreciation and amortization\n420\n186\n22\n628\n344\n90\n5\n439\nImpairment of tangible and other intangible assets\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\nOther operating costs (b)\n25\n2\n37\n64\n8\n—\n83\n91\nCorporate expense\n—\n—\n204\n204\n—\n—\n194\n194\nCIE stock-based compensation\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n189\n189\nProperty EBITDAR\n$\n991\n$\n386\n$\n51\n$\n1,428\n$\n878\n$\n253\n$\n9\n$\n1,140\nCorporate expense\n—\n—\n(204)\n(204)\n—\n—\n(194)\n(194)\nStock-based compensation expense (c)\n4\n3\n36\n43\n3\n2\n38\n43\nOther items (d)\n5\n5\n80\n90\n—\n4\n77\n81\nAdjusted EBITDAR\n$\n1,000\n$\n394\n$\n(37)\n$\n1,357\n$\n881\n$\n259\n$\n(70)\n$\n1,070",
