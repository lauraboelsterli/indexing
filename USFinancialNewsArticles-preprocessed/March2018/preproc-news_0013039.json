FILE PHOTO: Passengers leave flight AB6210, the last by insolvent carrier Air Berlin, at the Tegel airport in Berlin, Germany, October 28, 2017. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke The creditors have asked the administrator to find a firm to finance the planned litigation, the person added. Air Berlin, Etihad and the administrator declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment. The administrator had said it was assessing possible claims against Etihad that could potentially reach more than a billion euros, arguing that Etihad did not meet its financial obligations toward Air Berlin, once Germany’s No.2 carrier.
