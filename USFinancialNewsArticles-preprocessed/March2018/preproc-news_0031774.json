Prior to completing the Business Combination, WSII’s parent company, Algeco Scotsman Global S.á r.l. (together with its subsidiaries, the “Algeco Group”), undertook an internal restructuring in which WSII’s remote accommodations business was removed from WSII and retained by the Algeco Group. Financial results from WSII’s former remote accommodations business are presented as discontinued operations in the financial statements.\n2 - Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, as well as segment-level results (Modular Segments Adjusted EBITDA) to net loss, have been provided in the financial statement tables included in this press release. An explanation of these non-GAAP financial measures is included below under the heading “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Please see the non-GAAP reconciliation tables included at the end of this press release\n3 - Subsequent to the Business Combination, WSII operates in two operating segments (i) Modular - US (comprised of the contiguous 48 states and Hawaii), and (ii) Modular - Other North America (comprised of Canada, Alaska and Mexico). Corporate and other includes eliminations of costs and revenue between the operating segments, including the remote accommodations business prior to the Carve-Out Transaction, and the costs of certain corporate functions not directly attributable to the underlying segments incurred by the Algeco Group prior to or in connection with the Business Combination. Algeco Group legacy corporate overhead costs will not be included in our results going forward.\nBrad Soultz, President and Chief Executive Officer of Williams Scotsman commented, “2017 was a transformational year for Williams Scotsman, having completely recapitalized the Company in our Business Combination and secured the capital resources required to accelerate our growth. I am delighted with our performance in the fourth quarter, with our Modular Segments’ Adjusted EBITDA up 19.1% year-over-year, driven by the continued momentum of our ‘Ready to Work’ solutions and the scalability of our operating platform to grow units on rent across both of our Modular Segments. In our Modular - US segment in particular, modular space units on rent were up 6.0% and average monthly rate was up 10.2% in the fourth quarter year-over-year, evidencing the success our value proposition and growth initiatives have in the market.”\nSoultz continued, “We are accelerating robust organic growth with the acquisitions of Acton Mobile and Tyson Onsite. These strategic assets build seamlessly upon our existing platform, further differentiate Williams Scotsman with our customers, and expand our distribution of value added products and services. Looking ahead, our end markets are strong, we remain excited about the momentum in our core US business, and look to build upon this momentum in 2018.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nTotal consolidated revenues increased 16.8% to $120.4 million, as compared to $103.1 million in the prior year quarter.\nModular - US segment revenue increased 14.3% to $103.6 million as compared to $90.6 million in the prior year quarter, with modular space average units on rent up 6.0% and average monthly rental rate up 10.2% compared to the prior year quarter. Modular - Other North America segment revenue increased 33.1% to $16.9 million compared to $12.7 million in the prior year quarter, with modular space average units on rent up 8.6% and average monthly rental rate up 3.3% compared to the prior year quarter.\nThe Modular Segments delivered Adjusted EBITDA of $36.1 million, up 19.1% compared to $30.3 million in the prior year quarter. Modular - US segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 17.0% to $31.6 million and Modular - Other North America segment Adjusted EBITDA increased 36.4% to $4.5 million from the prior year quarter. Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA increased 56.8% to $31.2 million, as compared to $19.9 million in the prior year quarter.\nConsolidated net loss was $(125.4) million due to the transaction activity in the quarter, goodwill impairment and legacy costs associated with the Algeco Group discussed below.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nTotal consolidated revenues increased 4.5% to $445.9 million, as compared to $426.6 million in the prior year ended December 31, 2016. Leasing and services revenue increased 6.1% to $387.7 million, as compared to $365.4 million in the prior year.\nIn our Modular - US segment, revenue increased 7.5% to $392.9 million, as compared to $365.5 million in the prior year. Leasing and services revenue increased 10.5% to $345.4 million from $312.6 million in the prior year. Average modular space units on rent increased 2.2% to 36,166, average modular space utilization rate increased 190 bps to 73.9%, and average monthly rental rate increased 7.6% compared to the prior year. Our Modular - Other North America segment revenue decreased 13.4% to $53.7 million compared to $62.0 million in the prior year. Our Modular - Other North America segment leasing and services revenue decreased 20.0% to $42.9 million from $53.6 million in the prior year driven primarily by a single project that reached completion in July 2016. The completion of this project drove $10.2 million of the revenue decline in the Modular - Other North America segment.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA increased 2.2% to $108.8 million, as compared to $106.5 million in the prior year.\nOur Modular Segments contributed Adjusted EBITDA of $123.9 million, with Modular - US segment Adjusted EBITDA increasing 6.7% to $110.8 million and the Modular - Other North America segment decreasing to $13.1 million. We believe that the financial results from the Modular Segments most accurately represent the performance of our ongoing operations. The Corporate & other segment isolates selling, general and administrative costs related to WSII’s former parent company, Algeco Group, which were incurred prior to, or in connection with, the Business Combination of Double Eagle and WSII. Adjusted EBITDA from the Corporate & Other segment increased from $(21.7) million in 2016 to $(15.1) million in 2017. Algeco Group legacy corporate overhead costs will not be included in our results going forward.\n2017 was a transformational year with several complex transactions occurring in Q4 to effect the Business Combination. First, immediately prior to the Business Combination, the Algeco Group undertook the Carve-Out Transaction. The results of the former remote accommodations segment through November 29, 2017 are reflected as discontinued operations in the financial statements. In 2017, we incurred $(15.1) million of Adjusted EBITDA losses in the Corporate and other segment and $119.3 million of interest expense primarily incurred under the legacy Algeco Group corporate structure. The Business Combination and the Carve-out Transaction resulted in $33.3 million of transaction costs in the period, including expenses related to the Algeco Group long-term incentive plan. Currency gains of $12.9 million in the period were primarily driven by favorable changes in currency related to former Algeco Group intercompany loans, and an impairment of goodwill resulted in $60.7 million of non-cash charges. These extraordinary and transformational transactions resulted in a $(149.8) million net loss in 2017, amidst strong performance from our Modular Segments.\n2018 Outlook\nTimothy Boswell, Chief Financial Officer of Williams Scotsman commented, “We are exiting the fourth quarter of 2017 with momentum in our core operational metrics, and we expect to deliver a strong year of organic growth in 2018, which will be supplemented by our two recent acquisitions.” The company’s outlook for the full year 2018, inclusive of the Acton and Tyson acquisitions, appears below. This guidance is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in the “Forward-Looking Statements” below:\nTotal revenue between $560 million and $600 million Adjusted EBITDA between $165 million and $175 million Net rental capital expenditures after gross rental unit sales between $70 million and $100 million\nConference Call Information\nWilliams Scotsman will host a conference call and webcast to discuss its Q4 and FY17 results at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Friday, March 16, 2018.

The words “estimates,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “forecasts,” “plans,” “intends,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “shall,” and variations of these words and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which are generally not historical in nature. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other important factors, many of which are outside our control, which could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Although Williams Scotsman believes that these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, it can give no assurance that any such forward-looking statement will materialize. Important factors that may affect actual results or outcomes include, among others, our ability to acquire and integrate new assets and operations; our ability to manage growth and execute our business plan; our estimates of the size of the markets for our products; the rate and degree of market acceptance of our products; the success of other competing modular space and portable storage solutions that exist or may become available; rising costs adversely affecting our profitability; potential litigation involving our company; general economic and market conditions impacting demand for our products and services; implementation of tax reform; our ability to implement and maintain an effective system of internal controls; and such other risks and uncertainties described in the periodic reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) from time to time (including our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 5, 2017), which are available through the SEC’s EDGAR system at www.sec.gov and on our website. Any forward-looking statement speaks only at the date which it is made, and Williams Scotsman disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA. Williams Scotsman believes that this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors because it (i) allows investors to compare performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis by removing from operating results the impact of items that do not reflect core operating performance; (ii) is used by our board of directors and management to assess our performance; (iii) may, subject to the limitations described below, enable investors to compare the performance of Williams Scotsman to its competitors; and (iv) provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends. A metric similar to Adjusted EBITDA is also used to evaluate Williams Scotsman’s ability to service its debt. This non-GAAP measure should not be considered in isolation from, or as an alternative to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA and other non-GAAP financial measures differently, and therefore Williams Scotsman’s non-GAAP financial measures may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

Our Adjusted EBITDA for the historical periods presented was calculated in accordance with our ABL facility and our senior notes, excluding any pro forma adjustments to incorporate the results of acquisitions or future cost savings initiatives. Our adjusted EBITDA reflects the following further adjustments to EBITDA to exclude certain non-cash items and the effect of what we consider transactions or events not related to our core business operations:\nCurrency (gains) losses, net: on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currency. Substantially all such currency gains (losses) are unrealized and attributable to financings due to and from affiliated companies. Change in fair value of contingent consideration related to non-cash changes in fair value of an acquisition related earnout agreement. Goodwill and other impairment charges related to non-cash costs associated with impairment charges to goodwill, other intangibles, rental fleet and property, plant and equipment. Restructuring costs associated with restructuring plans designed to streamline operations and reduce costs. Other expense includes consulting expenses related to certain one-time projects, financing costs not classified as interest expense, gains and losses on disposals of property, plant, and equipment, and non-cash charges for WSII’s share-based compensation plans.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider the measure in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), cash flow from operations or other methods of analyzing Williams Scotsman’s results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nAdjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for our working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as discretionary cash available to reinvest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to meet our obligations. The following tables provide unaudited reconciliations of Net loss to Adjusted EBITDA.\nThe table below presents the unaudited reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, to consolidated net loss calculated in accordance with GAAP. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” above for further information regarding the Company’s use of non-GAAP financial measures.\nYear Ended December 31, (in thousands) 2017 2016 2015 Net loss $ (149,812 ) $ (30,936 ) $ (71,587 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax 14,650 32,195 (2,634 ) Loss from continuing operations (164,462 ) (63,131 ) (68,953 ) Income tax benefit (936 ) (24,502 ) (34,069 ) Loss from continuing operations before income taxes (165,398 ) (87,633 ) (103,022 ) Interest expense, net 107,076 84,443 82,250 Depreciation and amortization 81,292 78,000 101,148 Currency (gains) losses,net (12,878 ) 13,098 11,308 Goodwill and other impairments 60,743 5,532 — Restructuring costs 2,196 2,810 9,185 Transaction Fees 23,881 8,419 — Algeco LTIP expense 9,382 — — Other expense (a) 2,515 1,845 7,655 Adjusted EBITDA $ 108,809 $ 106,514 $ 108,524 (a) Other expense represents primarily acquisition related costs such as advisory, legal, valuation and other professional fees in connection with actual or potential business combinations, which are expensed as incurred, but do not reflect ongoing costs of the business.\nThe tables below present the unaudited reconciliations of quarterly Adjusted EBITDA by segment, which is a non-GAAP measure, to quarterly net (loss) income by segment calculated in accordance with GAAP.
