    "text": "NEW YORK, March 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- XpresSpa Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:XSPA), a health and wellness holding company, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. Please note that consolidated results for full year 2016 include eight days of operations for the Wellness segment following the close of the XpresSpa acquisition on December 23, 2016. Therefore, 2016 generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) results, as presented in this press release, are not comparable to full year 2017 results.\n“2017 was a transformative year for XpresSpa, as we perfected the short format spa, established our branded position as a pure play in health and wellness, and prepared the company for growth,” said Andrew Perlman, CEO of XpresSpa Group. “Having put top talent in place in our corporate and field teams, we made crucial improvements to our company-wide culture, our internal processes and the technology we use to operate our business. We completed the monetization of key non-core assets and also created partnerships to extend the XpresSpa brand through retail products. Through all this change, we further expanded our geographic footprint with net 4 new store openings and drove 3.0% same store sales growth. We accomplished a tremendous amount in a single year and are proud of the foundation we have built.”\nMr. Perlman continued: “As a pure play in on-the-go wellness, we are entirely focused on the execution of our core strategy. This year, we will work to increase store productivity and contribution margin through labor efficiency, new services and products and traffic analysis initiatives. We will also deepen our collaboration with existing and new partners in the travel vertical, leveraging XpresSpa’s unique position as the leader in the airport spa market, serving harried travelers with idle time in the airport. Key to our growth is the development of our new franchising capability to capture additional demand while we open company-owned XpresSpa and XpresRecover locations already in our pipeline. In all, our 2018 priorities center on enhancing our efficiency and growth to position us to further accelerate that growth in 2019. We are set for a great year of expanding the scale of XpresSpa’s footprint and brand and of delivering improved financial results.”\n2017 Consolidated Results Highlights\nAs noted above, consolidated results for full year 2016 include eight days of operations for the Wellness segment following the close of the XpresSpa acquisition on December 23, 2016 and are therefore not comparable to full year 2017 results. In addition, our full year 2017 and 2016 results reflect our FLI Charge and Group Mobile businesses as discontinued operations.\nConsolidated revenue from continuing operations was $48.8 million in 2017 compared to $12.0 million in 2016.\nConsolidated net loss from continuing operations was $16.1 million in 2017 compared to a net loss of $19.3 million in 2016.\nComprehensive loss, after discontinued operations, was $28.5 million in 2017 compared to $24.0 million in 2016. FLI Charge and Group Mobile are classified as discontinued operations. These businesses were sold in October 2017 and March 2018, respectively.\nThe adjustment to the company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 did not have a material impact to the Company’s financial statements.\n2017 Wellness Segment Highlights\nFull year 2016 results for XpresSpa are unaudited (and are not part of the financial statements). As noted above, only Wellness segment results from December 24 to December 31, 2016 are included in the Company’s audited financial statements.\nRevenue of $48.4 million increased 10.4% from $43.8 million in 2016\n9 store openings and the closure of 5 underperforming stores\nSame store sales growth of 3.0%\nGross profit of $9.4 million, or 19.4% margin, compared to $8.8 million, or 20.0% margin, in 2016; 2017 figure reflects increased labor and set-up costs associated with new store openings\nNet operating loss of $7.3 million decreased from a 2016 loss of $10.7 million\nAdjusted EBITDA of $1.9 million improved $8.8 million from a loss of $6.9 million in 2016, inclusive of $1.3 million of integration and one-time costs, as decreased expenses offset the gross margin comparison.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Wellness Segment Highlights\nRevenue was $11.8 million\nOpened 5 new locations during the quarter, including four domestic and one international\nIntroduced XpresCryo facial with partner Nordic Cryotherapy\nIntroduced Dermalogica skin care products\nGross profit was $2.4 million, or 20.4% margin\nOperating loss was $1.2 million\nAdjusted EBITDA was $0.4 million\nCompleted installation of new point-of-sale system in all locations\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure; see \"Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.

A reconciliation of operating loss for the wellness segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 to Adjusted EBITDA income (loss) is presented in the table below.\nWe consider Adjusted EBITDA to be an important indicator for the performance of our business, but not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have included this non-GAAP financial measure because management utilizes this informatin for assessing our performance and liquidity, and as an indicator of our ability to make capital expenditures and finance working capital requirements. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a measurement that is commonly used by analysts and some investors in evaluating the performance and liquidity of companies such as us. In particular, we believe that it is useful for analysts and investors to understand this indicator because it excludes transactions not related to our core cash operating activities. We believe that excluding these transactions allows investors to meaningfully analyze the performance of our core operations. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as an alternative to operating income or as an indicator of operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. In evaluating our performance as measured by Adjusted EBITDA, we recognize and consider the limitations of this measurement. Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our obligations for the payment of income taxes, interest expense, or other obligations such as capital expenditures. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA is only one of the measurements that management utilizes. The following table provides a reconciliation of operating loss for the wellness operating segment and corporate to Adjusted EBITDA income (loss) for each of the four quarters of 2017 and the full years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nXpresSpa Group, Inc.\nReconciliation of Operating Loss From Continuing Operations\nto Adjusted EBITDA Income (Loss) for Wellness Operating Segment\n($ in thousands) (Unaudited) Quarter Ended 2017 2016 3/31/2017 6/30/2017 9/30/2017 12/31/2017 Wellness XpresSpa Total revenue $ 10,984 $ 12,927 $ 12,652 $ 11,810 $ 48,373 $ 43,820 Cost of sales Labor 5,309 5,783 6,458 6,777 24,327 19,784 Occupancy 1,771 1,983 1,950 1,917 7,621 6,399 Product, supplies, and other operating costs 1,755 2,635 1,939 709 7,038 8,887 Total cost of sales 8,835 10,401 10,347 9,403 38,986 35,070 Gross Profit 2,149 2,526 2,305 2,407 9,387 8,750 Gross profit as a % of total revenue 19.6 % 19.6 % 18.2 % 20.4 % 19.4 % 20.0 % Depreciation and amortization Depreciation 1,129 2,327 1,110 984 5,550 3,309 Amortization 586 592 597 600 2,375 433 Total depreciation and amortization 1,715 2,919 1,707 1,584 7,925 3,742 Total general and administrative 2,805 1,599 2,237 2,071 8,712 15,673 Operating loss from continuing operations (2,371 ) (1,992 ) (1,639 ) (1,248 ) (7,250 ) (10,665 ) Plus: Depreciation and amortization 1,715 2,919 1,707 1,584 7,925 3,742 Merger and acquisition, integration and one-time costs 484 200 529 50 1,263 — Adjusted EBITDA income (loss) $ (172 ) $ 1,127 $ 597 $ 386 $ 1,938 $ (6,923 )\nXpresSpa Group, Inc.\nReconciliation of Operating Loss From Continuing Operations\nto Adjusted EBITDA Income (Loss) Company-Wide\n($ in thousands) Wellness Intellectual\nProperty Corporate Total\n2017 Operating loss from continuing operations $ (7,250 ) $ 9 $ (7,832 ) $ (15,073 ) Plus: Depreciation and amortization 7,925 23 28 7,976 Merger and acquisition, integration and one-time costs 1,263 — 152 1,415 Stock-based compensation expense — — 2,177 2,177 Adjusted EBITDA income (loss) $ 1,938 $ 32 $ (5,475 ) $ (3,505 )\nXpresSpa Group, Inc.\nWellness Segment Same Store Sales Growth for 2017\n($ in thousands)\nXpresSpa regularly measures comparable store sales, which it defines as current period sales from stores opened more than 12 months compared to those same stores’ sales in the prior year period (“Comp Store Sales”).
