FILE PHOTO: Feb 22, 2018; Pyeongchang, South Korea; Wendy Holdener (SUI) celebrates winning the bronze medal in the ladies' alpine skiing combined event during the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic Winter Games at Jeongseon Alpine Centre. Jeff Swinger-USA TODAY Sports Brignone, Olympic giant slalom bronze medallist at last month’s Pyeongchang Winter Games, was 0.91 seconds off the pace in fifth after the super-G leg but recovered in the slalom to clock an overall winning time of one minute 46.47 seconds. She was 0.03 seconds faster overall than second-placed Swiss Michelle Gisin, the Olympic champion in the combined discipline, with Petra Vlhova of Slovakia third.
