Volkswagen showed off a concept truck, Porsche has an $18,000 options package, and Hyundai's luxury brand debuted an all-electric sports car concept. \nThe New York International Auto Show opens to the public on Friday in Manhattan, and about 50 new cars, trucks and SUVs will be displayed at the event. Many of the vehicles have been shown before outside the U.S. or North America, but a few cars are making their global debut. Ever more popular SUVs and trucks were featured during the New York Auto Show's press days, but a few sedans and sports cars were unveiled as well. \nHere is a list of some of the biggest debuts: Cadillac XT4 Cadillac \nThe XT4 is a crossover that starts at around $36,000.

Volkswagen concept truck Adam Jeffery | CNBC Volkswagen concept pickup truck on display at the 2018 New York International Auto Show. \nForeign trucks can have a tough time competing in the U.S. market against American brands like Ford, GMC, Chevrolet and Ram. But automakers such as Toyota have been able to carve out niches. This is an example of what a Volkswagen truck would look like if it debuted here. Toyota RAV4 Adam Jeffery | CNBC 2018 Toyota Rav 4 on display at the 2018 New York International Auto Show on March 29th, 2018. \nThe RAV4 has been around for several years, but the 2019 version will offer a hybrid option. The SUV outsold the Camry for the first time in the U.S. in 2017. Nissan Altima Adam Jeffery | CNBC The 2019 Nissan Altima on display at the New York International Auto Show. \nNissan is not backing away from sedans, despite the increasing U.S. consumer preference for crossovers and SUVs.

Porsche GT3 RS with Weissach package Adam Jeffery | CNBC 2019 Porsche 911 GT3 RS on display at the 2018 New York International Auto Show. \nPorsche debuted the 911 GT3 RS with a Weissach package for the first time.
