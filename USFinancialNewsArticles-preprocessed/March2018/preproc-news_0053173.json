    "text": "FORT WORTH, Texas, March 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- AZZ Inc. (NYSE: AZZ), (the \"Company\"), a global provider of metal coating services, welding solutions, specialty electrical equipment and highly engineered services, today announced that it has completed the review of the materiality of certain historical accounting treatment of certain contracts in its Energy Segment as originally communicated in its January 9, 2018 press release. On March 26, 2018, the management of the Company in conferring with the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, BDO USA, LLP (\"BDO\"), concluded that the Company's previously issued audited consolidated financial statements (and any related audit reports of BDO) contained in the Company's 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K (which includes financial statements for years ending February 28, 2015, and February 29, 2016, and February 28, 2017) and the unaudited consolidated financial statements contained in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended May 31, 2017 and August 31, 2017 (collectively, the \"Relevant Periods\") should no longer be relied upon due to an accounting error. The Company determined that it should have applied the percentage-of-completion method of accounting under the FASB's Accounting Standards Codification No. 605-35, Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts (\"ASC 605-35\"), for certain contracts of the Company as further described below. After conferring with the Company's management and BDO, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company concurred with the above conclusion of the Company's management.\nThe Company will file amendments to its Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the Relevant Periods to restate the previously issued annual and interim financial statements. Although the Company cannot yet estimate when it will complete the restatements and file the amended annual and periodic reports, the Company is working diligently and expeditiously towards completion of the restatements and intends to file the amended annual and periodic reports as soon as reasonably practicable and prior to filing its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended November 30, 2017.\nThe restatements described above result from a correction to the accounting method historically used by the Company to record revenues for certain contracts within its Energy Segment. In particular, the Company determined that for certain contracts for which revenue was recognized upon contract completion and transfer of title, the Company instead should have applied the percentage-of-completion method in accordance with ASC 605-35. In general, the percentage-of-completion method results in a revenue recognition pattern over time as a project progresses as opposed to deferring revenues until contract completion. The Company determined that the impact of applying the percentage-of-completion method to certain of its revenue contracts was materially different from its previously reported results primarily for certain current asset balance sheet accounts under its historical practice.\nPaul Fehlman, senior vice president and CFO of AZZ Inc., commented, \"We're moving quickly to complete and issue these amended reports, and want to assure all shareholders that these changes were only for a limited number of subsidiaries in its Energy Segment, caused by a misapplication of FASB's Accounting Standards Codification 605-35, and do not reflect a fundamental change in the Company's underlying business. Further, the restatements will not impact cash and cash equivalents and do not impact our compliance with our contractual obligations.\" Fehlman continued, \"The attached tables showing the anticipated impacts to the income statements and consolidated balance sheets demonstrate that the restatements will impact the balance sheets to a greater extent than the income statements.\"\nAlso, in connection with the restatements, the Company re-evaluated its conclusion regarding the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting for the Relevant Periods and determined that a material weakness existed relating to revenue recognition on certain contracts. In addition, as a result of the material weakness, BDO USA LLP's report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of February 28, 2017 should no longer be relied upon. Management has begun to develop and institute a plan to remediate this material weakness.\nAbout AZZ Inc.\nAZZ Inc. is a global provider of metal coating services, welding solutions, specialty electrical equipment and highly engineered services to the markets of power generation, transmission, distribution and industrial in protecting metal and electrical systems used to build and enhance the world's infrastructure.
