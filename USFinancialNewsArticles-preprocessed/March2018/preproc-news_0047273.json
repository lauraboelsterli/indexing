    "text": "SHENZHEN, China, March 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- China Information Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq: CNIT), a leading provider of internet-based ad distribution and ad display terminal sharing systems in China, today announced its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFiscal Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nRevenue was $18.2 million, an increase of 78.4%, compared to $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nGross profit as a percentage of revenue was 45.8%, increased from 25.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet income attributable to the Company was $0.9 million, or $0.02 per share, compared to a net loss of $18.2 million, or ($0.45) per share for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nExcluding non-cash items, adjusted net income was $4.9 million, or $0.12 per share, compared to an adjusted net loss of $8.6 million, or ($0.21) per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFiscal Year 2017 and Recent 2018 Operational Highlights\nIn 2017, the Company has completed business transformation to a leading products and services provider of Cloud-Application-Terminal (CAT) and IoT technology based digital advertising distribution network and new media resource sharing platform in the Out-of-Home Advertising Market in China.\nFrom May 2017, CNIT has rolled out and offered interactive ads display terminals, digital ads distribution system, and advertising resource sharing platform to the customers in the private sector. The company’s cloud-based ad terminals are widely received by the market. Since May 2017, the Company has entered into 26 contracts for the sale of 91,000 CNIT cloud-based ad terminals, which are expected to generate sales and service revenue of about $29.1 million.\nLaunched Taoping Net and Taoping App. Taoping Net provides an advertising- resources trading service platform which connects screen owners, advertisers and consumers. Taoping App, which enables customers to distribute and manage ads from mobile terminals, effectively satisfies the need to distribute fragmented ads.\nThe Company’s innovation of Taoping new-media ecosystem has proven to be the major driver for the market expansion of CNIT’s cloud-based products and solutions in the fast-growing advertising industry of China. CNIT has started to penetrate the cloud advertising market from China’s first-tier city to smaller ones.\n“We’re glad to see our strong market performance and financial improvements in 2017,” said Mr. Jianghuai Lin, Chairman and CEO of CNIT. “As our new business model proven successful and sustainable, we believe that 2018 will be another booming year for CNIT. We are expecting to sell an additional 120,000 cloud-based ad terminals by 2018, reaching over 200 million people in 100 cities throughout China.”\nThe CEO reiterated the Company’s financial projection for fiscal year of 2018 and 2019 - revenue in 2018 is expected to range from $30 to $33 million, with adjusted net income of $9 to $11 million, and revenue in 2019 is expected to be between $55 and $60 million, with adjusted net income of $20 to $23 million.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue\nRevenue was $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $8.0 million, or 78.4%.\nThe increase was primarily due to the successful transformation of business model from a mainly IT solutions provider to the public sector to a leading products and services provider of CAT and IoT technology based digital advertising distribution network and new media resource sharing platform in the Out-of-Home Advertising Market in China.\nGross Profit\nGross Profit was $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $ 5.7 million compared to $ 2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 45.8% for the year ended December 31, 2017, increased from 25.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe increase in the overall gross margin primarily resulted from the cost advantages in new products and services offered to customers in the private sector. The Company has outsourced production for CAT and IoT technology based ads display terminals that has provided significant cost savings. Also, the revenue generated from sales of software related products and services have demanded high gross margin.\nAdministrative, R&D and Selling expenses\nAdministrative expenses decreased by $4.7 million, or 56.6%, to $3.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of revenue, administrative expenses decreased to 19.9% for 2017, from 81.8% for 2016. Such decrease was primarily due to reductions in provision for bad debt reserve, foreign currency fluctuation exposure, and head counts for the TIT segment as a result of business model transformation.\nResearch and development expenses increased by $1.0 million, or 32.4%, to $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses decreased to 22.2% for 2017, from 29.9% in 2016. Such increase was primarily due to depreciation of software newly purchased in 2017 and software used for the digital ads distribution and sharing platform servicing our customers to efficiently and cost effectively promote their branding.\nSelling expenses decreased by $0.2 million, or 16.1%, to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was due to further reduction in sale force of the TIT segment.\nNet income (loss) attributable to Company\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net income attributable to the Company was $0.9 million, compared to a net loss of $18.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCash, Liquidity and Financial Position\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $3.3 million, compared to $3.8 million as of December 31, 2016. The Company had a working capital deficiency of $1.5 million as of December 31, 2017, significantly improved from a working capital deficiency of $5.7 million as of December 31, 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by operating activities was $4.5 million, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $2.8 million in 2016.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains non-GAAP financial measures for earnings that exclude non-cash charges. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they exclude non-cash charges that management excludes when it internally evaluates the performance of the Company’s business and makes operating decisions, including internal budgeting, and performance measurement, as these measures provide a consistent method of comparison to historical periods. Moreover, management believes these non-GAAP measures reflect the essential operating activities of the Company. Accordingly, management excludes the expense arising from certain non-cash charges when making operational decisions. The Company also believes that providing the non-GAAP measures that management uses to its investors is useful to investors for a number of reasons. The non-GAAP measures provide a consistent basis for investors to understand the Company’s financial performance in comparison to historical periods. In addition, it allows investors to evaluate the Company’s performance using the same methodology and information as that used by the Company’s management. Non-GAAP measures are subject to inherent limitations because they do not include all of the expenses included under GAAP and because they involve the exercise of judgment of which charges are excluded from the non-GAAP financial measure. However, the Company’s management compensates for these limitations by providing the relevant disclosure of the items excluded.\nThe following table presents the non-GAAP financial measures contained in this press release and the most directly comparable GAAP measures and provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nFull Year 2017 and 2016 Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) Attributable to the Company and EPS to Exclude Non-cash Expenses\n2017 2016 Net income (loss) attributable to the Company $ 858,605 $ (18,170,601 ) Provisions for losses on accounts receivable and other current assets 422,388 1,995,046 Provision for obsolete inventories 176,570 324,581 Depreciation 2,036,438 1,736,607 Amortization of intangible assets 820,468 845,149 Stock-based compensation 487,407 273,102 Stock-based payment for consulting fee 96,313 - Change in fair value of warrant liability (3,720 ) (34,175 ) Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets - 4,442,367 Adjusted net income (loss) $ 4,894,469 $ (8,587,924 ) Weighted average number of shares outstanding Basic 40,231,159 40,175,439 Diluted 40,333,646 40,175,439 Earnings (loss) per share Basic $ 0.02 $ (0.45 ) Diluted $ 0.02 $ (0.45 ) Adjusted earnings (loss) per share Basic $ 0.12 $ (0.21 ) Diluted $ 0.12 $ (0.21 ) About China Information Technology, Inc.\nChina Information Technology, Inc.
