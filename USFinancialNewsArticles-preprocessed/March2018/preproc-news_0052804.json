    "text": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited China from Sunday to Wednesday on an unofficial visit, China’s state news agency Xinhua reported on Wednesday.\nThe visit was Kim’s first known journey abroad since he assumed power in 2011 and is believed by analysts to serve as preparation for upcoming summits with South Korea and the United States.\nThe report did not say whether the two sides discussed North Korea’s pursuit of nuclear weapons, which has led to tough U.N. sanctions, backed by China.\nReporting by David Stanway; Editing by Paul Tait\n ",
