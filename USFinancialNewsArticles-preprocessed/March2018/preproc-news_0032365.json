    "text": "March 16, 2018 / 8:00 PM / in 7 minutes Speculators lift U.S. dollar net shorts to largest since October -CFTC, Reuters Reuters Staff 1 Min Read NEW YORK, March 16 (Reuters) - Speculatorsâ€™ net short U.S. dollar bets rose to a five-month high this week, according to calculations by Reuters and Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday. The value of the net short dollar position was $14.61 billion in the week to March 13, compared with $11.46 billion the previous week. Net short positioning on the greenback has increased for a third straight week. U.S. dollar positioning was derived from net contracts of International Monetary Market speculators in the yen, euro, British pound, Swiss franc and Canadian and Australian dollars.
