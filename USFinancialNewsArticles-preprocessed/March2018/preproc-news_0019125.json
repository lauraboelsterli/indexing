    "text": "March 6 (Reuters) - A strike by West Virginia teachers ended on Tuesday with a deal to raise their pay 5 percent after more than a week of protests across the state, according to Governor Jim Justice.\n“I stood rock solid on the 5% Teacher pay raise and delivered,” Justice said on Twitter. “Not only this, but my staff and I made additional cuts which will give all State employees 5% as well. All the focus should have always been on fairness and getting the kids back in school.”\nReporting by Gina Cherelus and Jonathan Allen in New York; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ",
