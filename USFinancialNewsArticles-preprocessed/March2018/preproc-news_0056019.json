Meyer, MD and Fred A. Middleton have joined the Company’s Board of Directors as of March 28, 2018. Directors John M.

Michelle Berrey, MD, MPH, President and Chief Executive Officer of Chimerix. “On behalf of the management and my fellow Directors, I would like to thank John and Jim for their significant contributions, and to extend my personal gratitude to Ernie for his leadership as our Chairman through this significant period in Chimerix’s growth. Ernie leaves us well-positioned for next steps as we complete our brincidofovir registrational programs and prepare for commercialization.”\n“Chimerix has successfully progressed brincidofovir to clinical trials that truly have the potential to change the outcomes for patients with life-threatening illnesses. I am confident in the Chimerix team and proud to be working with them and the Board during this pivotal time in the company's history,” said Ms. Demski. “The new board members have combined experience in public health, regulatory affairs and corporate strategy that will be invaluable as the Company advances its clinical development programs.”\nMr. Greissing has served as the Executive Director of the Lynda and Stewart Resnick Center for Public Health at the Milken Institute since 2016.

As a result, brincidofovir may never be successfully commercialized. In addition, Chimerix may be unable to file for regulatory approval for brincidofovir with other regulatory authorities. These risks, uncertainties and other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Risks are described more fully in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents subsequently filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
