    "text": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - Perry Warjiyo, who has been nominated to become Bank Indonesia (BI) governor, told a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday that the central bank can support both economic growth and financial stability at the same time.\nWarjiyo, currently a deputy BI governor, also said macroprudential rules need to be relaxed to spur lending growth, and that he wants banks to buy more corporate bonds. He did not elaborate.\nHe said Southeast Asia’s largest economy will likely grow 5.2-5.3 percent in 2018, fractionally above last year’s pace.\nWarjiyo is the sole nominee proposed for central bank governor by President Joko Widodo.\nIf Warjiyo’s nomination is approved by parliament, he will succeed Agus Martowardojo, whose five-year term as governor ends in May.\nReporting by Maikel Jefriando; Writing by Gayatri Suroyo; Editing by Richard Borsuk\n ",
