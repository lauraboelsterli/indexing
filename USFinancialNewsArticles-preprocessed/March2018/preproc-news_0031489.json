    "text": "2017 revenue up 21% to $57.7 million, includes record-setting 41 machines sold Machine revenue up 43% in 2017 to $30 million; non-machine revenue up 4% to\n$27.7 million Backlog of $21.3 million at year end Expect 2018 revenue growth in excess of 20%, while accelerating technology investment\nNORTH HUNTINGDON, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The ExOne Company (NASDAQ: XONE) (“ExOne” or “the Company”), a global provider of three-dimensional (“3D”) printing machines and 3D printed and other products, materials and services to industrial customers, reported financial results today for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\n“We are confident that our team’s 2017 accomplishments have ExOne on the right track. With 21% growth, we achieved a record revenue level at nearly $58 million, while continuing to accelerate our technology development,” stated Jim McCarley, ExOne’s Chief Executive Officer.\n“Operationally, we made significant advancements on many fronts:\nOur customers operating Exerial™ machines are creating molds and cores in production environments, successfully enabling the 3D printing of unique component designs on their factory floors. We now have customer installations operating with cold hardening phenolic (CHP) binder on three continents and expect accelerated growth in 2018. Along with SGL Group, we recently announced the availability of CARBOPRINT™ 3D printed products, demonstrating the diversity of materials that can be printed with our binder jetting technology. Advancements made with our fine powder recoating technology are enabling the development of our large format fine powder machine, expected to be launched in 2018. We are expanding our material offerings in the tooling, filtration and energy markets.\nWe believe that these investments, along with our technology development roadmap for 2018, will drive continued double-digit revenue growth and accelerated adoption of our binder jetting technology in 2018 and beyond,” Mr. McCarley noted.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year Revenue – Machine Revenue Growth Validates Binder Jetting\nQuarter Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenue by Product Line 3D Printing Machines $ 12.9 64 % $ 7.5 51 % $ 30.0 52 % $ 21.0 44 % 3D Printed and Other Products, Materials and Services (\"Non-machine\")\n7.3 36 % 7.1 49 % 27.7 48 % 26.8 56 % Total Revenue $ 20.2 100 % $ 14.6 100 % $ 57.7 100 % $ 47.8 100 % Consolidated revenue for the 2017 fourth quarter grew 38% over the prior-year fourth quarter. Machine revenue was up 72% to $12.9 million, driven by 16 machines sold in the 2017 fourth quarter, compared with 12 in the 2016 fourth quarter. Non-machine revenue was up 2% to $7.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with the prior year.\nFor the year, consolidated revenue grew 21% to $57.7 million compared with 2016. Excluding revenue attributable to product lines that the Company has exited, the comparable revenue grew 25%. Machine revenue was up 43%, driven by eight more machines sold, for a total of 41 in 2017. Non-machine revenue was up 4% in 2017. Excluding revenue attributable to product lines that the Company has exited, the comparable non-machine revenue grew by 10%.\nGiven the long sales cycle and significance of a machine’s average selling price relative to total revenue, fluctuations in machine-sale revenue vary from quarter to quarter. ExOne does not believe that such quarter-to-quarter fluctuations are necessarily indicative of larger trends.\nFourth Quarter Operations – Impacted by Accelerated Investments\n($ in millions,\nexcept per-share amounts)\nQ4 2017 Q4 2016 Change % Change Gross profit $6.7 $5.2 $1.5 28% Gross margin 33.0% 35.7% Operating loss ($1.9) ($2.4) $0.5 21% Net loss ($1.9) ($2.6) $0.7 23% Diluted EPS $ (0.12) $ (0.16) $0.04 25% Gross profit of $6.7 million benefited from revenue growth and favorable product mix, partially offset by lower profitability relating to new products and technology releases which unfavorably impacted the gross margin in the 2017 fourth quarter.\nR&D expense of $2.7 million for the quarter was up $0.6 million compared with the 2016 fourth quarter, attributable to internal talent additions, external resources to accelerate technology, and IP development.\nSG&A expense was $5.8 million compared with $5.5 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase included higher commissions, as well as internal talent and external resources to advance technology adoption.\nThe 2017 fourth quarter net loss was $1.9 million, or $0.12 per share, compared with a $2.6 million net loss, or $0.16 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The improved net loss was principally due to higher revenue, partially offset by lower profitability relating to new products and technology releases as well as accelerated technology investments.\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”), a non-GAAP measure, was a $0.1 million loss in the 2017 fourth quarter, compared with a $0.7 million loss in last year’s fourth quarter. ExOne management believes that, when used in conjunction with other measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), Adjusted EBITDA assists in the understanding of its financial results. See the attached tables for important disclosures regarding the Company’s use of Adjusted EBITDA as well as a reconciliation of net loss (most directly comparable GAAP measure) to Adjusted EBITDA for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n2017 Review – Revenue Growth Offset by Costs for Operational Advancement\n($ in millions,\nexcept per-share amounts)\n2017 2016 Change % Change Gross profit $14.4 $14.2 $0.2 2% Gross margin 24.9% 29.6% Operating loss ($19.7) ($14.4) ($5.3) (37%) Net loss ($20.0) ($14.6) ($5.4) (37%) Diluted EPS $ (1.25) $ (0.92) $ (0.33) (36%) Gross profit was $14.4 million, resulting in a 24.9% gross margin for 2017, compared with 29.6% in 2016. Despite higher revenue and favorable product mix, the 2017 results were impacted by lower profitability relating to new products and technology releases previously noted, as well as several other activities as described in prior quarters. These included a $2.8 million sale of four Exerial TM machines at a breakeven contribution margin, a $1.5 million charge for obsolete inventories associated with the completion of a design evaluation of the Exerial TM platform, approximately $0.7 million of costs associated with the Company’s consolidation and exit from its North Las Vegas PSC and non-core specialty machining operations in Michigan, partially offset by approximately $0.3 million of net gains on the disposal of the impacted property and equipment. The 2016 period benefited by $0.3 million from the net impact of a sale associated with an exited product line offset by losses on disposals of property and equipment.\nR&D expense was $9.9 million in 2017 compared with $7.8 million in 2016, attributable to technology investments in IP and know-how for our coarse and fine powder machine capabilities, broadening binder and material combinations, and printer process development.\nSG&A expense for 2017 was $24.2 million, up $3.4 million compared with 2016, with most of the increase pertaining to prior quarters. It included investments in internal talent and external resources to advance technology adoption, as well as unusual employee related costs and a charge for impairment of intangible assets associated with an exited product line.\nThe net loss for 2017 was $20.0 million, or $1.25 per share, compared with $14.6 million, or $0.92 per share in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA was a $10.9 million loss for 2017, compared with a $7.3 million loss for 2016. ExOne management believes that, when used in conjunction with other measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, assists in the understanding of its financial results. See the attached tables for important disclosures regarding the Company’s use of Adjusted EBITDA as well as a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nCapitalization – Disciplined Cash Management\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31, 2017 were $22.2 million, compared with $28.2 million at December 31, 2016. Cash used for operating activities in 2017 and 2016 was $9.7 million and $2.7 million, respectively. The increase reflected a higher net loss, partially offset by working capital management while achieving significant revenue growth. Cash capital expenditures were $1.0 million for 2017, compared with $1.3 million for 2016. In addition, in 2017, the Company realized $3.7 million of cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, including facility exits.\nIn 2018, the Company expects cash capital expenditures of $1 to $1.5 million.\nOutlook – Introducing 2018 Revenue Growth and Additional R&D Expectations\nMr. McCarley concluded, “Our outlook for 2018 remains positive. We believe that the rate of growth sustained in 2017 can be replicated in 2018, when we once again expect revenue growth in excess of 20%. However, to accelerate growth beyond 2018 we need to accelerate our investments in technology development. We anticipate an additional $6 million to $8 million of R&D expense in 2018, to advance our technology roadmap. The marketplace for our products and services continues to grow in size as does demand for greater equipment and process capability. Through continued investment in our people and our technology, ExOne is well positioned to meet this demand and remain the leader in binder jetting technology for industrial applications.”\nWebcast and Conference Call\nExOne will host a conference call and live webcast on Thursday, March 15 at 4:45 p.m. Eastern Time.

net 0.1 0.1 0.2 (0.2 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ (0.1 ) $ (0.7 ) $ (10.9 ) $ (7.3 ) ExOne defines Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) as net loss (as calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”)) plus interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, and other expense (income) - net. Use of Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, is intended as a supplemental measure of ExOne’s performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.\nThe Company believes Adjusted EBITDA is meaningful to its investors to enhance their understanding of ExOne’s financial results. Although Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily a measure of the Company’s ability to fund its cash needs, the Company understands that it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a measure of financial performance and to compare ExOne’s performance with the performance of other companies that report Adjusted EBITDA. ExOne’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180315006272/en/\nThe ExOne Company\nBrian Smith, 724-765-1350\nChief Financial Officer\nbrian.smith@exone.com\nor\nKei Advisors LLC\nDeborah K.
