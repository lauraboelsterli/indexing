    "text": "RAMSEY, N.J. and BOCA RATON, Fla., March 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ADMA Biologics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADMA) (“ADMA” or the “Company”), a vertically integrated commercial biopharmaceutical and specialty immunoglobulin company that manufactures, markets and develops specialty plasma-derived biologics for the treatment of immmune deficiencies and prevention of certain infectious diseases, today announced its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFinancial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nADMA reported total revenues of $22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $12.1 million, or approximately 113%. The increase in revenues was primarily due to the accretive nature of assets and commercial product rights acquired from the Biotest Pharmaceuticals Corporation Therapy Business Unit (“BTBU”), which was completed in June 2017.\nThe consolidated net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $43.8 million, or $1.91 per basic and diluted share, as compared to a consolidated net loss of $19.5 million, or $1.61 per basic and diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net loss of $24.3 million was attributable to increased product revenue costs of $22.8 million, which included manufacturing costs related to our plasma fractionation production facility in Boca Raton, FL acquired in the BTBU transaction (the “Boca Facility”), third-party consultant fees of approximately $3.8 million pertaining to the remediation efforts and enhancements of the Company’s quality management systems in preparation for an FDA inspection, as well as increased selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) of $9.6 million. SG&A in 2017 included transaction costs of $3.9 million for the acquisition of BTBU as well as expenses associated with BTBU not present in 2016. The increased operational costs in 2017 were offset by the increased revenues. Included in the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 were non-cash expenses of $6.9 million for stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization, non-cash interest expense, an asset impairment charge and a loss on the extinguishment of debt related to the refinancing of the Company’s senior debt in October 2017.\nAdam Grossman, President and Chief Executive Officer of ADMA, stated, “We are pleased with our significant year-over-year revenue growth in 2017, which includes accretive revenues related to Nabi-HB in addition to the organic revenue growth of approximately 11% related to our plasma collection centers business segment. In addition, we believe that the substantial progress we have made with our Compliance Enhancement Program has allowed us to remedy the identified compliance issues at the Boca Facility, and we believe that we are now ready for a routine inspection of the facility by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as we continue to execute on our business plan.”\nAt December 31, 2017, ADMA had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $43.1 million, as compared to $15.3 million at December 31, 2016. ADMA’s net working capital as of December 31, 2017 was $53.7 million, as compared to $10.4 million as of December 31, 2016.\nAbout ADMA Biologics, Inc.
