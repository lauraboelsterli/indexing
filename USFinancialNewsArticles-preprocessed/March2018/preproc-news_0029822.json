    "text": "Nikola Jokic recorded his seventh triple-double of the season Sunday with 20 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists, helping the Denver Nuggets coast past the Sacramento Kings 130-104 at Pepsi Center in Denver.\nThe win allowed the Nuggets to complete a 2-1 homestand before embarking on a stretch of eight road games in their next nine outings.\nThe loss was the Kings’ fourth in their last seven games, a stretch in which they’ve alternated losses and wins.\nSacramento hung within 44-39 near the midpoint of the second quarter before the Nuggets used a 22-10 burst to close the first half with a 66-49 lead.\nWill Barton and Gary Harris had three-point plays and combined for 14 points in the runaway.\nJokic’s triple-double was the 13th of his career. He ranks third in the NBA this season with seven, trailing only Russell Westbrook and LeBron James, with all seven having come since Jan. 8.\nThe big man connected on all four of his 3-point attempts, helping the Nuggets outscore the Kings 45-18 from beyond the arc.\nJokic surrendered game-high scoring honors to Harris, who hit nine of his 16 shots, including a pair of 3-pointers, en route to 21 points.\nJamal Murray (20 points), Wilson Chandler (16), Trey Lyles (14) and Devin Harris (11) also scored in double figures for the Nuggets, who topped 130 points for the fifth time this season.\nThe win allowed Denver to snap an 89-all tie in the all-time series with the Kings and capture the season series 3-1.\nBuddy Hield had a team-high 18 points off the bench for the Kings, who had beaten the Nuggets 106-98 in Sacramento in January.\nKosta Koufos recorded a 14-point, team-high 10-rebound double-double for the Kings, while Zach Randolph, De’Aaron Fox and Willie Cauley Stein added 12 points apiece and Frank Mason III 10.\nFox also recorded a team-high nine assists.\nSacramento moves on to face Oklahoma City on the second night of a back-to-back on Monday.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
