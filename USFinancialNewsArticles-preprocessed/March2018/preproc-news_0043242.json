    "text": "0 COMMENTS Photo: Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Marketers often review their creative-agency relationships with an eye to shifting their business to a similar but less expensive company. \nNot Johnson & Johnson . JNJ -1.79% The health-care giant, which recently wrapped up a monthslong review of its creative agencies, never planned on parting from WPP or Omnicom , OMC -0.86% its two main creative partners. \nRather, the focus was on changing the way J&J worked with the agencies. The result was the creation of new dedicated agency groups within each advertising holding company, with the work divvied up by consumer brand. J&J also consolidated some assignments with WPP and Omnicom that had previously been handled by other agencies. \nJ&J is the latest marketer to push its agencies to evolve and adapt to the more complicated demands of digital advertising. \nAlison Lewis, J&J’s chief marketing officer, said the goal was to create a more integrated and flexible agency model that can quickly pull in agency talent and churn out and optimize digital ad content. She said the company also aims to generate savings by preventing different groups from doing overlapping work, as well as by creating new production models. \nWhen the closed review began, the New Brunswick, N.J.-based company was targeting savings of about 30%, according to people familiar with the matter. \n“When we were just television and print and maybe PR, we could live in a world of more siloed creative because the brand person could tie that together,” Ms. Lewis said. Now, she said, with all the duplication across disciplines and the need to quickly generate ad content, the accounts need to be “consolidated at the holding companies as a way to drive that agility and integration.” \nEach holding company will have a New York City office with dedicated staffers, while leaving space for individuals from digital media partners like Google and Facebook , as well as employees from J&J’s dedicated media agency at Interpublic Group of Co s. \nThe idea is to get everyone together for meetings to discuss, “What’s news this week? What’s data telling us? What are some new opportunities?” Ms. Lewis said. \nJ&J brands include Tylenol, Listerine, Zyrtec, Visine, Neutrogena and Johnson’s Baby, among others. \nOmnicom’s dedicated agency, called Velocity, consists of talent from creative shops BBDO, DDB and Roberts & Langer, as well as Omnicom’s public relations agency network. The new group will be led by Brian Nienhaus, who most recently led We Are Unlimited , Omnicom’s similar dedicated agency for McDonald’s Corp. , according to people familiar with the matter. \nWPP’s dedicated group, called Neighborhood, will pull talent and resources from creative agency JWT, digital shop VML, production firm Hogarth, shopper marketing agency Geometry and WPP public-relations agencies. The leadership is still being hashed out at WPP, but Krystal Herr, who supports the J&J account for JWT, is expected to play a significant role, according to people familiar with the matter. \nThe J&J account at WPP contributes around $75 million to $100 million in annual revenue to the holding company, according to a person familiar with the matter. \nIt’s unclear whether the size of the WPP’s and Omnicom’s J&J business will change under the new structure. While WPP and Omnicom may now have fewer people billing hours on the account, they will likely make up at least some of that revenue through added business that J&J consolidated with the holding companies. \nWPP and Omnicom declined to comment. \nBy pulling the best talent from creative, digital and PR teams, marketers like J&J are looking for new ways to create ads that resonate with their increasingly ad-averse consumers. And they’re looking to do it with leaner, more efficient teams. \nThey’ve also come under pressure to drive growth and cut costs as their own businesses grapple with new competition from e-commerce giants like Amazon and other startups. \n“Now there are a lot more local or e-players in the space and they do move faster,” said Ms. Lewis. “You need more fluid resources. I think it’s also because we’re in a world, thanks to data, where we’re constantly able to hunt and find new growth opportunities relatively quickly. We have to be able to act on those.” \nWrite to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com",
