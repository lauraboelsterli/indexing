Chilean president elect Sebastian Pinera speaks to the media during a news conference in Santiago, Chile, December 18, 2017. REUTERS/Rodrigo Garrido Pinera, a former president and business mogul, said he charged four fund managers with administrating some $665 million in wealth as required by Chilean law. He said he voluntarily placed $504 million more in two other blind trusts even though it was not required. Reporting by Antonio de la Jara; Writing by Luc Cohen; Editing by Matthew Lewis",
