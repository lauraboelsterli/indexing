Ten people survived the crash that took place in the Amhara region, police commander Mohammed Ahmed said. “The majority of victims were students,” he told Amhara Mass Media Agency. Deadly traffic accidents are common in Ethiopia, where driving standards are poor and many vehicles badly maintained. Reporting by Aaron Maasho; editing by Elias Biryabarema",
