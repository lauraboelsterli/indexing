    "text": "Tech Guide A federal court just revived Oracle's multi-billion dollar copyright case against Google The federal court said Google's use of Oracle's Java development platform to create the Android operating system was not protected under the fair-use provision of copyright law. Oracle had previously sought $9 billion in damages. The closely watched case dates to 2010. Published 1 Hour Ago Reuters Andrew Evers | CNBC Oracle CEO Mark Hurd at a roundtable during the company's OpenWorld conference in San Francisco on Oct. 3, 2017. \nA U.S. appeals court on Tuesday resurrected a multi-billion dollar copyright case brought by Oracle against Google . \nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said Google's use of Oracle's Java development platform to create the Android operating system was not protected under the fair-use provision of copyright law, reversing a 2016 jury verdict. \nThe court sent the case back to a U.S. judge in San Francisco for a trial to determine how much compensation Google owes Oracle. \nOracle had previously sought $9 billion in damages. \n\"We are disappointed the court reversed the jury finding that Java is open and free for everyone. This type of ruling will make apps and online services more expensive for users. We are considering our options,\" a Google spokesperson told CNBC. \nOracle did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nThe closely watched case, which dates to 2010, involves how much copyright protection should extend to the Java programming language, which Google used to design the Android operating system that runs most of the world's smartphones. \nOracle is seeking royalties for Googles use of some of the Java language, while Google argues it should be able to use Java without paying a fee. \nâ€”CNBC's Jillian D'Onfro contributed to this report.
