    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Assurant, Inc. (NYSE:AIZ), a global provider of risk management solutions, today announced the pricing of a public offering of $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2021 (the “2021 Senior Notes”), $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.200% Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Senior Notes”), $300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 4.900% Senior Notes due 2028 (the “2028 Senior Notes”) and $400,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 7.000% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2048 (the “Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes” and, together with the 2021 Senior Notes, 2023 Senior Notes and the 2028 Senior Notes, the “Notes”). The offering is expected to close on March 27, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nThe net proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be approximately $1.3 billion, after deducting the underwriting discounts and the estimated offering expenses payable by the company. The company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering together with proceeds from the issuance of 2,875,000 shares of its 6.50% Series D Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, cash on hand and common stock consideration, to fund the company’s previously announced acquisition of TWG Holdings Limited, refinance its existing 2.50% Senior Notes due 2018 and pay related fees and expenses.\nThe offering is not contingent upon the consummation of the acquisition of TWG Holdings Limited, although the 2021 Senior Notes, 2023 Senior Notes and the Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes are subject to a special mandatory redemption, in whole but not in part, if the acquisition is not consummated. The 2028 Senior Notes are not subject to a special mandatory redemption and will remain outstanding even if the company does not consummate the acquisition.\nMorgan Stanley & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC are acting as joint book-running managers for the offering.\nAn effective shelf registration statement, under which the Notes will be issued, was filed previously with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The offering and sale of the Notes is being made only by means of a prospectus and an accompanying prospectus supplement related to the offering. You can get copies of these documents for free by visiting EDGAR at the SEC website at www.sec.gov .
