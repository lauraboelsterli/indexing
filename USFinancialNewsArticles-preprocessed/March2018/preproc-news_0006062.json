The increase was primarily attributable to increases in revenue across the various service lines, as discussed below.\nThe following table sets forth a breakdown of revenue by business segment for the periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n2016\n2017\n(in '000, Except for %)\nRMB\n% of Revenue\nRMB\nUS$\n% of Revenue\nSupply Chain Management\n415,228\n13.5%\n529,518\n81,385\n8.1%\nExpress\n1,812,850\n58.8%\n4,347,485\n668,196\n66.5%\nFreight\n565,409\n18.3%\n963,666\n148,113\n14.8%\nStore +\n274,084\n8.9%\n591,743\n90,949\n9.1%\nOthers\n17,031\n0.5%\n98,592\n15,153\n1.5%\nRevenue\n3,084,602\n100.0%\n6,531,004\n1,003,796\n100.0%\nExpress Service Revenue increased by 139.8% to RMB4,347.5 million (US$668.2 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB1,812.9 million in the same period of 2016. This increase in revenue was primarily due to the expansion of the Company's service scope to include last-mile delivery services starting in 2017 and a 67.8% YoY increase in parcel volume, as a result of greater demand for express delivery services and increase in the Company's market share. The average revenue per parcel in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 43.0% to RMB3.42 (US$0.53), compared to the same period of 2016, primarily due to the Company's service scope expansion, partially offset by a decrease in average parcel weight. Supply Chain Management Service Revenue increased by 27.5% to RMB529.5 million (US$81.4 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB415.2 million in the same period of 2016. Such increase was primarily attributable to the addition of new customers and the increasing business volume of existing customers. Freight Service Revenue increased by 70.4% to RMB963.7 million (US$148.1 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB565.4 million in the same period of 2016. This increase was the result of greater freight volume which increased by 21.9% and a 39.8% increase in average revenue per tonne, compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in average revenue per tonne was primarily due to upward price adjustments, a greater proportion of long-distance freight volumes in connection with the expansion of the Company's freight network, and the expansion of the Company's service scope to include last-mile delivery services starting in 2017. BEST Store + Service Revenue increased by 115.9% to RMB591.7 million (US$90.9 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB274.1 million in the same period of 2016, primarily due to an increase in the number of store orders fulfilled in connection with the rapid expansion of the Company's BEST Store + network as well as the Company's acquisition of WOWO in May 2017.

The increase was primarily attributable to increase in lease, transportation and labor costs in connection to significant volume growth, the expansion of the Company's service scope (17) to include last-mile delivery services, as well as increase in the amount of merchandise sold by Store + services. Cost of Revenue as a Percentage of Revenue decreased to 95.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017 from 105.4% in the same period of 2016, primarily due to economies of scale, network optimization, as well as increased operational efficiency resulting from proactive cost-control measures and continuous technology improvements and applications.\n(17) Starting in 2017, the Company revised its arrangements with franchisees and the scope of its service. As a result, the Company became the principal that is directly responsible for last-mile delivery of all parcels and freight processed through its network, and the Company is liable to senders for damage to or loss of parcels and freight in connection with last-mile delivery. Therefore, in consideration of such expanded scope of services and increased responsibilities, the Company increased the fee it charges to pick-up service stations and incurred additional cost of revenue that were attributable to fees for destination franchised service stations that the Company engaged for the provision of last-mile delivery service. Starting in 2017, the Company revised its arrangements with franchisees and the scope of its service. As a proxy, in the fourth quarter of 2017, Express and Freight incurred approx.

This decrease was mainly due to the faster growth in revenue and economies of scale.\nSelling Expenses increased by 70.8% to RMB207.6 million (US$31.9 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB121.6 million in the same period of 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in shipping and handling costs to RMB51.5 million (US$7.9 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB33.8 million in the same period of 2016, relating to delivery of merchandise to the Company's membership stores and staff costs in connection with the expansion of BEST Store + network, the addition of retail store occupancy cost of RMB27.2 million (US$4.2 million) as a result of the acquisition of WOWO in May 2017 and the inclusion of share-based compensation expense of RMB1.1 million (US$0.2 million). General and Administrative Expenses increased by 49.8% to RMB211.1 million (US$32.4 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB140.9 million in the same period of 2016. This increase is primarily attributable to the increased staff costs in connection with the growth of the Company's operations and the inclusion of share-based compensation expense of RMB14.1 million (US$2.2 million). Research and Development Expenses increased by 20.1% to RMB29.0 million (US$4.5 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB24.1 million in the same period of 2016. This increase was primarily due to increased research and development activities and the inclusion of share-based compensation expense of RMB2.3 million (US$0.4 million).\nInterest Income increased to RMB24.1 million (US$3.7 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB10.5 million in the same period of 2016, primarily due to a higher yield generated from the Company's cash balance.\nInterest Expense increased to RMB14.4 million (US$2.2 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB7.2 million in the same period of 2016, primarily as a result of an increase in the Company's Renminbi-denominated bank borrowings to satisfy working capital requirements as the Company held a significant amount of bank deposits in foreign currencies outside China.\nForeign Exchange Gain was RMB0.8 million (US$0.1 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to foreign exchange loss of RMB1.2 million in the same period of 2016. This is primarily due to changes in exchange rates between Renminbi and U.S. dollars during the respective periods.\nOther Income increased to RMB21.1 million (US$3.2 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB8.1 million in the same period of 2016, primarily due to increases in other miscellaneous fees.\nOther Expense increased to RMB4.9 million (US$0.8 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB3.9 million in the same period of 2016, primarily due to increases in various miscellaneous expenses.\nIncome Tax Expense increased to RMB3.4 million (US$0.5 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB0.5 million in the same period of 2016, reflecting tax payable in the fourth quarter of 2017 by certain of the Company's PRC subsidiaries which had taxable income during the period, primarily WOWO.\nGross Profit was RMB288.3 million (US$44.3 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to gross loss of RMB167.2 million in the same period of 2016.

This increase in revenue was primarily due to the expansion of the Company's service scope to include last-mile delivery services starting in 2017 and a 74.1% YoY increase in parcel volume, as a result of greater demand for express delivery services and increase in the Company's market share. The average revenue per parcel in fiscal year 2017 increased by 36.3% to RMB3.39 (US$0.52), compared to 2016, primarily due to the Company's service scope expansion, partially offset by a decrease in average parcel weight. Average revenue per parcel excluding the impact of service scope expansion decreased to RMB2.07 from RMB2.49 in 2016. Supply Chain Management Service Revenue increased by 29.0% to RMB1,601.0 million (US$246.1 million) in fiscal year 2017 from RMB1,241.4 million in 2016. Such increase was primarily attributable to the addition of new customers and increasing business volume of existing customers. Freight Service Revenue increased by 98.1% to RMB3,178.0 million (US$488.5 million) in fiscal year 2017 from RMB1,604.6 million in 2016. This increase was the result of greater freight volume which increased by 44.7% and a 36.8% increase in average revenue per tonne, compared to 2016. The increase in average revenue per tonne was primarily due to upward price adjustments, a greater proportion of long-distance freight volumes in connection with the expansion of the Company's freight network, and the expansion of the Company's service scope to include last-mile delivery services starting in 2017. BEST Store + Service Revenue increased by 297.3% to RMB2,226.0 million (US$342.1 million) in fiscal year 2017 from RMB560.2 million in 2016, primarily due to an increase in the number of store orders fulfilled in connection with the rapid expansion of the Company's BEST Store + network as well as the Company's acquisition of WOWO in May 2017. The number of store orders fulfilled increased by 249.5% compared to 2016.

A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, including but not limited to the following: BEST's goals and strategies; BEST's future business development, results of operations and financial condition; BEST 's ability to maintain and enhance its ecosystem; BEST 's ability to continue to innovate, meet evolving market trends, adapt to changing customer demands and maintain its culture of innovation; and fluctuations in general economic and business conditions in China and assumptions underlying or related to any of the foregoing. Further information regarding these and other risks is included in BEST's filings with the SEC. All information provided in this press release and in the attachments is as of the date of this press release, and BEST does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required under applicable law.\nUSE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIn evaluating its business, BEST considers and uses non-GAAP measures, such as non-GAAP net loss, non-GAAP net loss margin, adjusted EBITDA, and EBITDA, as supplemental measures in the evaluation of the Company's operating results and in the Company's financial and operational decision-making. The Company believes that EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss margin are measures that help identify underlying trends in the Company's business that could otherwise be distorted by the effect of the expenses and gains that the Company includes in loss from operations and net loss. The Company believes that EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss margin provide useful information about its operating results, enhance the overall understanding of its past performance and future prospects and allow for greater visibility with respect to key metrics used by the Company's management in its financial and operational decision-making. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned \"Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Measures to the Nearest Comparable GAAP Measures\" in the results announcement.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional information to help investors compare business trends among different reporting periods on a consistent basis and to enhance investors' overall understanding of the Company's current financial performance and prospects for the future. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, U.S. GAAP results. In addition, the Company's calculation of the non-GAAP financial measures may be different from the calculation used by other companies, and therefore comparability may be limited.\nRECONCILIATIONS OF
