This includes approximately $139.50 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at December 31, 2017, held by our joint venture, BeiGene Biologics, to build a commercial biologics facility in Guangzhou, China and to fund research and development of biologics drug candidates in China. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 do not include the net proceeds raised in the January 2018 public offering.\nThe increase of $80.08 million in the in the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to the receipt of $170.95 million from Celgene as part of upfront licensing fees from the tislelizumab collaboration, offset by increased research and development spending and capital expenditures as we continue to advance our pipeline.\nThe increase of $469.35 million from the prior year period was primarily due to cash received from Celgene from the tislelizumab collaboration, including upfront licensing fees of $263.00 million and an equity investment of $150.00 million, and net proceeds of $188.52 million from our August 2017 follow-on public offering, offset by increased cash used in operations and for capital expenditures.\nCapital expenditures for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 were $18.93 million and $58.73 million, compared to $8.06 million and $23.50 million, respectively, for the same periods in 2016, primarily attributable to increased investment in our manufacturing facilities in Guangzhou and Suzhou.\nRevenue for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 was $18.17 million and $238.39 million, respectively, compared to nil and $1.07 million in the same periods in 2016, attributable to product and collaboration revenue under the Celgene collaboration.\nProduct revenue from sales of ABRAXANE and REVLIMID in China totaled $15.61 million and $24.43 million for the fourth quarter and from August 31, 2017 (the closing of the Celgene transaction) to December 31, 2017, respectively.\nCollaboration revenue totaled $2.57 million and $213.96 million for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, reflecting recognition of the upfront licensing fees from Celgene in the third quarter and deferred upfront fees recognized in the fourth quarter.\nExpenses for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 were $121.97 million and $336.84 million, respectively, compared to $37.27 million and $118.13 million in the same periods in 2016.\nCost of sales for the fourth quarter and from August 31 to December 31, 2017 were $3.03 million and $4.97 million, respectively. Cost of sales relates to the cost of acquiring ABRAXANE and REVLIMID for distribution in China.\nR&D Expenses for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 were $91.34 million and $269.02 million, respectively, compared to $28.93 million and $98.03 million in the same periods in 2016. The increase in R&D expenses was primarily attributable to increased spending on our ongoing late-stage clinical trials, increased manufacturing costs for our drug candidates due to expansion of ongoing clinical programs, and increased employee compensation expense as a result of increased headcount to support our clinical programs. Additionally, R&D-associated share-based compensation expense was $10.95 million and $30.61 million for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to $2.90 million and $8.08 million for the same periods in 2016, due to increased headcount and a higher share price.\nSG&A Expenses for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 were $27.42 million and $62.60 million, respectively, compared to $8.34 million and $20.10 million in the same periods in 2016. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily attributable to increased headcount, including employees transferred from Celgene China in connection with the license agreement for Celgene’s commercial products in China, as well as higher professional service fees related to the Celgene transaction and patent prosecution activities, and costs to support our growing operations. In addition, SG&A-associated share-based compensation expense was $5.51 million and $12.25 million for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to $1.05 million and $2.55 million for the same periods in 2016.\nNet Loss for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 was $99.28 million and $93.30 million, respectively, compared to a net loss of $37.60 million and $119.22 million in the same periods in 2016.\nFinancial Summary\nSelect C onsolidated B alance S heet Data (U.S. GAAP) (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars)\n(Audited) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016\nCash, cash equivalents and short‑term investments $ 837,516 $ 368,174 Working capital 763,509 339,341 Property and equipment, net 62,568 25,977 Total assets 1,046,479 405,813 Total liabilities 362,248 52,906 Noncontrolling interest 14,422 — Total equity $ 684,231 $ 352,907\nC onsolidated Statements of Operations (U.S. GAAP) (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars, except for number of American Depositary Shares (ADSs) and per ADS data) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n(Unaudited) Twelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n(Audited) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenue Product revenue, net $ 15,606 $ — $ 24,428 $ — Collaboration revenue 2,568 — 213,959 1,070 Total revenues 18,174 — 238,387 1,070 Expenses Cost of sales – products (3,030) — (4,974) — Research and development (91,340) (28,933) (269,018) (98,033) Selling, general and administrative (27,415) (8,337) (62,602) (20,097) Amortization of intangible assets (187) — (250) — Total expenses (121,972) (37,270) (336,844) (118,130) Loss from operations (103,798) (37,270) (98,457) (117,060) Interest (expense) income, net (527) 47 (4,108) 383 Changes in fair value of financial instruments — — — (1,514) Gain (loss) on sale of available-for-sale securities 34 (338) 44 (1,415) Other income (expense), net 9,926 (289) 11,457 443 Loss before income taxes (94,365) (37,850) (91,064) (119,163) Income tax (expense) benefit (4,915) 252 (2,235) (54) Net loss $ (99,280) $ (37,598) $ (93,299) $ (119,217) Less: Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest 43 — (194) — Net loss attributable to BeiGene, Ltd. $ (99,323) $ (37,598) $ (93,105) (119,217) Net Loss per ADS, basic and diluted $ (2.19) $ (1.05) $ (2.23) $ (3.84) Weighted-average number of ADSs outstanding – basic and diluted 45,402,681 35,663,284 41,783,497 31,047,650\nC onsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) (U.S. GAAP) (Amounts in thousands of U.S. Dollars) Three Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n(Unaudited)\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n(Audited)\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Net loss $ (99,280) $ (37,598) $ (93,299) $ (119,217) Other comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax of nil: Foreign currency translation adjustments (134) (232) 851 (245) Unrealized holding gain, net (354) 251 (296) 1,108 Comprehensive loss (99,768) (37,579) (92,744) (118,354) Less: Comprehensive loss attributable to noncontrolling interests 73 — (105) — Comprehensive loss attributable to BeiGene, Ltd. $ (99,841) $ (37,579) $ (92,639) $ (118,354) About BeiGene\nBeiGene is a global, commercial-stage, research-based biotechnology company focused on molecularly targeted and immuno-oncology cancer therapeutics.
