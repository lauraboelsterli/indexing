REUTERS/Rodrigo Garrido Codelco, the world’s largest copper miner, saw costs spike 7.8 percent during the same period, the daily El Mercurio reported, as the miner has been forced to dig deeper, and through poorer quality ore, to keep output flowing in recent years.

The final 2017 profit and production figures are due to be released next week. Chile is the world´s top copper producer. Reporting by Santiago Newsroom; Editing by Mark Potter",
