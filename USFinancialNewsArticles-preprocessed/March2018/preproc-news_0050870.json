    "text": "KUALA LUMPUR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Over the last decade, pressure from consumers and green groups has pushed big companies that produce, trade or buy palm oil to tackle labor abuses on plantations and commit to ending deforestation that is contributing to climate change.\nYet the small farmers who grow close to half the fruit that yields the edible oil in major suppliers Malaysia and Indonesia have been largely left out of efforts to make the industry greener and more ethical, industry officials say.\nHere are some facts about palm oil and the debate around it:\nSources: RSPO, Malaysian Palm Oil Council, The Sustainable Trade Initiative, Reuters\nReporting by Michael Taylor, Editing by Megan Rowling.
