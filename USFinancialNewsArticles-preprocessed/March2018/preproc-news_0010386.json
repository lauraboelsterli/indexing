Department of justice say shkreli has failed to show any genuine remorse Prosecutors say federal sentencing guidelines, which judges need not follow, would call for a sentence of at least 27 years in prison Prosecutors say shkreli has “consistently chosen to put profit and the cultivation of a public image before all else” Prosecutors say shkreli believes the ends always justify the means Prosecutors say shkreli has demonstrated a lack of acceptance of responsibility, and a lack of respect for the law Prosecutors file sentencing recommendation with federal court in brooklyn, new york\n ",
