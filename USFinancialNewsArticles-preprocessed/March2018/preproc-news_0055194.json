In March, Carter joined Bank of America’s U.S. Trust division, where she leads business planning, governance and controls. \nAxelrod will report to Merrill Lynch Wealth Management Head Andy Sieg. She left FINRA in January after 28 years with the securities industry’s self-regulator. \nAxelrod’s last job with the organization was as executive vice president for regulatory operations.
