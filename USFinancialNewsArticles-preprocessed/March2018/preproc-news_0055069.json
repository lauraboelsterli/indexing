    "text": "349 COMMENTS MOSCOW—Russia will expel U.S. and European diplomats and close the U.S. consulate general in St. Petersburg in response to measures taken against Russia over its alleged role in the poisoning of a former double agent in England.\nThe Russian measures, announced Thursday by the Russian Foreign Ministry, follow the coordinated expulsion ordered this week of more than 130 Russian diplomats from the U.S. and European countries, after the U.K. government said Russia was responsible for the use of a military-grade nerve agent in an attempt to murder Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. Russia has denied it was behind the attack. \nThe foreign ministry said Thursday it had summoned the U.S. ambassador, Jon Huntsman, and told him that 58 U.S. envoys in Moscow and two in St. Petersburg would have to leave Russia by April 5.\n“It was recommended to the U.S. authorities, who are encouraging and fanning a campaign of slander against our country, to come to their senses and put a stop to reckless actions that are destroying bilateral relations,” the ministry said in a statement.\nRelated Video The deepening rift between Moscow and the West is raising tensions to levels not seen since the Cold War. Following a coordinated response by Western allies, scores of Russian diplomats and intelligence officers have been expelled. WSJ's Niki Blasina explains the escalating situation. The nerve-agent attack and the subsequent sanctions have deepened a rift between Russia and the West over Moscow’s alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and its military interventions in Ukraine and Syria.\nThe U.S., Canada and more than a dozen European countries expelled scores of Russian diplomats and intelligence officers on Monday. The ejections of 60 Russians that the U.S. identified as intelligence officers—48 from the Russian embassy and 12 from the permanent mission to the United Nations—was the largest number of expulsions since the end of the Cold War.\nSpeaking at a separate press conference Thursday, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov described the measures taken by the U.S. and other Western countries last week as “unacceptable actions that are taken under the toughest pressure of the U.S. and the U.K. under the pretext of the so-called ‘Skripal case,’” state news agency RIA reported.\nIn Washington, the State Department criticized Russia’s moves Thursday as regrettable and unwarranted.\n“We don’t see this as a diplomatic tit for tat. Russia is responsible for that horrific attack,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said, in reference to the poisoning. “They don’t need to act like a victim.” \nMs. Nauert added that the U.S. reserved the right to respond further to Russia’s recent moves.\nThe British government considered the Trump administration’s response to the poison attack “very strong,” Mark Sedwill, British Prime Minister Theresa May’s national security adviser, told journalists in Washington on Thursday. He said Washington’s action to punish the Kremlin “was something that the U.S. government was considering for quite some time anyway, because of a range of Russian behavior that was unacceptable.”\nMr. Sedwill also said that the steps to penalize Russia might not be over, for Britain or its allies. He accused Moscow of a pattern of “aggressive” covert behavior. “So we are introducing a range of other restrictions to essentially dismantle this capability as we discover other components of it,” he said. “We are encouraging other countries to do the same.”\nFormer U.S. officials said while the U.K. could seek to corral allies into a coordinated sanctions package against Russia, it was unclear if the EU and the Trump administration would be on board.\nPresident Donald Trump appears to want to maintain ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin to work together on Syria and on North Korea, though State Department officials have criticized Moscow in recent days for doing little on either front.\n“He’s going to seek to limit the damage to U.S.-Russia ties because he still sees and still wants a genuinely positive relationship with Russia,” said Mark Simakovsky, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and former defense department official. “He is pursuing initiatives in Iran and North Korea and elsewhere that he believes can be achieved with Russia.”\n—Felicia Schwartz and Gerald F. Seib in Washington contributed to this article.\nWrite to James Marson at james.marson@wsj.com \nCorrections & Amplifications \nThe U.S. alone expelled 60 Russian diplomats after the nerve-agent poisoning, with other countries demanding the departure of more than 70 others. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that a total of 60 people had been expelled. (March 29, 2018)",
