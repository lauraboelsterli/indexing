    "text": "IBEX 35 --- \nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 closed 0.77 percent lower provisionally, with most sectors and major bourses finishing in negative territory. This despite the market opening higher and U.S. markets seeing strong gains, after a week session on Friday. \nItalian stocks were the standout fallers. The FTSE MIB closed down 1.2 percent lower after an uneasy truce between the country's two populist, anti-establishment parties on Friday . EU nations expel Russian diplomats \nThe Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Beijing and Washington had begun to quietly negotiate U.S. access to Chinese markets, easing concerns of a full-blown trade war. Stocks initially showed signs of a rally earlier in the session following the news. \nBut equities pared gains sharply after the U.S. and multiple EU nations moved to expel Russian diplomats on Monday. The move follows hot on the heels of the U.K.'s decision to expel Russian diplomats after the country determined that the Kremlin was responsible for the poisoning of an ex-spy on British soil. \nLooking at individual stocks, Fresnillo surged to the top of the European benchmark after a ratings upgrade from Goldman Sachs . The U.S. investment bank raised its stock recommendation to \"buy\" and added the stock to its conviction list. Shares of Fresnillo closed 4.5 percent higher. \nMeanwhile, Smurfit Kappa said it had rejected a revised bid from International Paper company, on Monday. The U.S. company had previously made an unsolicited offer at the beginning of March. Shares of Smurfit Kappa closed down more than3 percent. Trade war fears ease \nStateside, stocks traded higher, bouncing back from strong losses in the previous session as investors monitored reports of talks between the U.S. and China. \nPresident Donald Trump signed a memorandum on Friday that could see charges implemented on up to $60 billion of imports from Beijing, though the measures have a 30-day consultation period before they take effect. \nThe tariffs follow additional duties on steel and aluminum imports on a number of countries worldwide, including China, with the world's second-largest economy hitting back with its own plans to impose charges on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports.
