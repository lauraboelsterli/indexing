    "text": "March 15, 2018 / 2:16 PM / Updated 9 minutes ago CANADA STOCKS-Toronto stocks inch up on higher oil prices, global stocks Reuters Staff 2 Min Read March 15 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index crept up on Thursday, lifted by higher oil prices and a tentative rise in global stocks, with Magna International Inc leading the charge after announcing a partnership with U.S. ride-hailing company Lyft Inc. * The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index was trading up 37.75 points, or 0.24 points, at 15,692.97 at 10 a.m. EDT (1400 GMT). Eight of the 10 major sector groups were in positive territory. * Magna was the biggest gainer on the index, up as much as 4.3 percent to C$72.79, a two-week high, after the auto parts maker said on Wednesday it would invest $200 million in Lyft and work with the U.S. company to manufacture self-driving cars. * Wood products maker Stella-Jones Inc was the second-biggest gainer, recovering from a 6.2 percent drop on Wednesday after saying its margins would remain under pressure in 2018. It was up 3.6 percent at C$45.99 on Thursday. * Energy companies including Spartan Energy Corp, TORC Oil & Gas Ltd and Birchcliff Energy Ltd were among the 10 biggest gainers, rising 2.4 percent, 2.2 percent and 2 percent respectively. * U.S. crude futures advanced 0.5 percent to $61.29 a barrel. * Gold and silver miner Klondex Mines Ltd was the biggest decliner on the index, losing 9.6 percent. * Other miners, including Ivanhoe Mines Ltd, Lundin Mining Corp and Eldorado Gold Corp, were also among the 10 biggest decliners, as metal prices pulled back. * Gold futures dropped 0.6 percent to $1,318.40 an ounce. Copper futures lost 1.3 percent to $6,900 a tonne. * Consumer cyclicals was the group with the biggest gains on the index, climbing 1.1 percent. Healthcare was the biggest decliner, falling 0.4 percent. * The TSX had 142 advancing issues, 97 declining ones and 11 flat. (Reporting by Nichola Saminather; editing by Jonathan Oatis)",
