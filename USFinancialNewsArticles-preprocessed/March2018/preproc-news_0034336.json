    "text": "March 19, 2018 / 4:54 PM / Updated 30 minutes ago CANADA STOCKS-TSX extends losses as oil slides, investors brace for U.S. rate hike Reuters Staff 2 Min Read March 19 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index fell on Monday, led by the energy sector as oil prices slipped, and investors were cautious ahead of a near-certain U.S. interest rate hike this week. * At 12:29 p.m. ET (1629 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX Composite Index fell 123.05 points, or 0.78 percent, to 15,588.28. * Oil prices slipped on Monday as energy market investors remained wary of growing crude supply, although tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran gave prices some support. * The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 400 points as investors awaited the U.S. Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting, which concludes on Wednesday. * Canadian tech stocks were lower on Monday, tracking a deep selloff in U.S. tech sector after Facebook fell 7.7 percent following reports of data misuse. * The TSX posted no new 52-week highs and 4 new lows. Across all Canadian issues there were 8 new 52-week highs and 15 new lows. * The largest percentage gainer on the TSX was Novagold , which rose 9.0 percent, while the largest decliner was B2gold Corp, down 5.3 percent. * Among the most active Canadian stocks by volume were Neovasc Inc, down 5.7 percent at $0.17; Aurora Cannabis, up 0.3 percent at $10.98 and Klondex Mines , up 61.1 percent at $2.90. * Gold miner Klondex was up after U.S. miner Hecla Mining Co said it would buy the company in a $462 mln cash-and-stock deal. * Volume on the TSX index was 82.07 million shares, while total volume on Monday was 139.28 million shares.
