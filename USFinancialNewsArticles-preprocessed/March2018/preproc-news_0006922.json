(NYSE: SRI) today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2017. For the full year 2017, Stoneridge reported sales of $824.4 million, an increase of $128.5 million, or 18.4%, compared with 2016. In addition, the Company reported EPS of $1.57, and adjusted EPS of $1.57 for 2017.\nJon DeGaynor, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"2017 was a tremendous year for Stoneridge. We continued to build on our foundation of continuous improvement, exceeding our expectations for each of our key financial metrics while at the same time strengthening our leadership team and successfully integrating Orlaco into our Electronics business. Our ability to execute in multiple dimensions helped to accelerate our long-term strategy and achieve financial success during the year. I believe that all of our business segments are well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable, profitable growth in 2018 and beyond.\"\nFor the full year 2017, Stoneridge reported gross profit of $248.1 million (30.1% of sales) and adjusted gross profit of $249.8 million (30.3% of sales) which improved approximately 220 basis points in 2017 resulting in an increase of $54.4 million, or 27.8%, compared with 2016. Operating income for the full year 2017 was $57.4 million (7.0% of sales) and adjusted operating income was $66.9 million (8.1% of sales) which improved approximately 180 basis points in 2017 resulting in an increase of $22.8 million, or 51.8%, compared with the prior year. 2017 adjusted EBITDA was $95.8 million (11.6% of sales) which improved approximately 170 basis points in 2017 resulting in an increase of $27.1 million, or 39.5%, relative to 2016.\nFourth quarter 2017 sales were $207.4 million, an increase of 20.2% over fourth quarter 2016, with EPS of $0.65. Adjusted EPS was $0.42 considering, (i) the expense resulting from the step-up in the fair value of the earn-out related to the Orlaco and PST acquisitions, (ii) fixed asset gains related to an insurance claim, (iii) expenses related to certain business realignment costs, and (iv) one-time gains related to the impact of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which have been removed to reflect normalized earnings and a normalized tax rate.\nFull Year in Review\nControl Devices segment sales increased by 10.4% primarily as a result of new product sales and increased sales volume in the North American automotive market as well as increased sales volume in China, and to a lesser extent, the commercial vehicle market. Segment operating income increased by 17.4% relative to 2016 while operating margin expanded by 90 basis points.\nElectronics segment sales increased by 34.9% primarily due to an increase in European and North American off-highway vehicle product sales substantially related to the acquired Orlaco business, as well as an increase in sales volume in European and North American commercial vehicle products. Segment gross margin improved primarily due to lower material and overhead costs as a percentage of sales as well as a favorable mix related to Orlaco product sales. Adjusted operating income for the segment increased by 61.1% while operating margin expanded by 120 basis points relative to 2016.\nPST segment sales increased by 15.1% primarily due to an increase in monitoring service revenues as well as a favorable foreign currency translation that increased sales. Adjusted operating margin improved by $8.7 million relative to 2016, finishing the year with a 5.5% adjusted operating income (loss) margin relative to a (4.2%) operating income (loss) margin in 2016. Margin improved due to lower direct material costs related to a favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates and favorable sales mix related to higher monitoring service revenues.\nDeGaynor added, \"Each of our segments contributed to our success in 2017 with double-digit sales growth and impressive margin expansion. Control Devices continued to drive global revenue growth with significant expansion in China and continued success in our actuation and sensor product groups. Electronics leveraged the addition of Orlaco to increase revenue by over $80.0 million with margin expansion of 120 basis points. Additionally, we have announced some large recent awards which contributed to an impressive 14.9% growth in our backlog in 2017. Finally, PST ended the year with 15% revenue growth and a 970 basis point improvement in operating margin.\"\nCash and Debt Balances\nAs of December 31, 2017, Stoneridge had cash and cash equivalent balances totaling $66.0 million. Total debt as of December 31, 2017, was $129.0 million. Total debt less cash and cash equivalents yields a current net debt to trailing-twelve-month adjusted EBITDA ratio of approximately 0.7x.\nIn 2017, Stoneridge generated $78.9 million of cash from operations, compared with $65.3 million for the previous year. Adjusted capital expenditures in 2017 were $32.9 million compared with $24.5 million in 2016. As a result of cash from operations less adjusted capital expenditures, adjusted free cash flow in 2017 was $46.0 million compared with $40.8 million in 2016.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company announces 2018 sales guidance of $840 - $860 million compared with 2017 sales of $824.4 million, which implies midpoint growth of 3.1%.\nFurther, the Company announces guidance for 2018 adjusted gross margin of 31.0% - 32.0% (midpoint improvement of 120 basis points), adjusted operating margin of 9.0% - 10.0% (midpoint improvement of 140 basis points) and adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.5% - 13.5% (midpoint improvement of 140 basis points).\nThe Company also announces 2018 adjusted EPS guidance of $1.90 - $2.10, including the impact of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is expected to increase adjusted EPS through a reduction to the Company's effective tax rate to 20.0% - 25.0%.\nConference Call on the Web\nA live Internet broadcast of Stoneridge's conference call regarding 2017 fourth-quarter results can be accessed at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time on Thursday, March 1, 2018, at www.stoneridge.com , which will also offer a webcast replay.\nAbout Stoneridge, Inc.\nStoneridge, Inc., headquartered in Novi, Michigan, is an independent designer and manufacturer of highly engineered electrical and electronic components, modules and systems principally for the automotive, commercial, off-highway, motorcycle, and agricultural vehicle markets.

Such non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to their closest GAAP financial measures at the end of this press release.
