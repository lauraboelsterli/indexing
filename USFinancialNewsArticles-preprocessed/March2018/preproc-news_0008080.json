See the attached schedule for a reconciliation of net cash flow provided by operating activities to discretionary cash flow.\nOil and gas sales during the fourth quarter of 2017 were $35,080,000 as compared to $16,429,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, oil and gas sales increased 62% to $108,287,000 as compared to $66,667,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Stated on an Mcfe basis, unit prices received during the fourth quarter and the year ended December 31, 2017 were 16% and 38% higher, respectively, as compared to the prices received during the comparable 2016 periods.\nLease operating expenses during 2017 totaled $33,162,000 as compared to $28,508,000 in 2016.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, general and administrative expense was $10,180,000 lower than 2016. The decrease in general and administrative expense during the 2017 annual period was primarily the result of the inclusion of costs associated with the Company's two debt exchanges in 2016.\nProduction taxes for the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $1,312,000, as compared to $(255,000) in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Goodson, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. “In addition, we established a 25,000 gross acre position in an area that we believe will ultimately be determined to be in the core of the Louisiana Austin Chalk oil trend. Our current plans call for us to spud our initial horizontal Austin Chalk well during the second quarter of 2018 and we are continuing to evaluate various joint venture structures in connection with our 2018 Cotton Valley development plan.”\nAbout the Company\nPetroQuest Energy, Inc. is an independent energy company engaged in the exploration, development, acquisition and production of oil and natural gas reserves in Texas and Louisiana.

All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this news release are forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, these statements are based upon assumptions and anticipated results that are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks. Actual results may vary significantly from those anticipated due to many factors, including the volatility of oil and natural gas prices; our indebtedness and the significant amount of cash required to service our indebtedness; our estimate of the sufficiency of our existing capital sources, including availability under our multi-draw term loan facility; our ability to fund and execute our Cotton Valley and Austin Chalk development programs as planned; our ability to increase recoveries in the Austin Chalk formation and to increase our overall oil production as planned; our estimates with respect to fracked Austin Chalk wells in Louisiana, including production EURs and costs; our estimates with respect to production, reserve replacement ratio and finding and development costs; our receipt of a cash refund with respect to our offshore bonds and the timing and amount of the same; our responsibility for offshore decommissioning liabilities for offshore interests we no longer own; our ability to hedge future production to reduce our exposure to price volatility in the current commodity pricing market; our ability to find, develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable and to replace reserves and sustain and/or increase production; ceiling test write-downs resulting, and that could result in the future, from lower oil and natural gas prices; our ability to raise additional capital to fund cash requirements for future operations; limits on our growth and our ability to finance our operations, fund our capital needs and respond to changing conditions imposed by our multi-draw term loan facility and restrictive debt covenants; approximately 51% of our production being exposed to the additional risk of severe weather, including hurricanes, tropical storms and flooding, and natural disasters; losses and liabilities from uninsured or underinsured drilling and operating activities; changes in laws and governmental regulations as they relate to our operations; the operating hazards attendant to the oil and gas business; the volatility of our stock price; and our ability to meet the continued listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange with respect to our common stock or to cure any deficiency with respect thereto.

(56,598 ) Note: Management believes that discretionary cash flow is relevant and useful information, which is commonly used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the oil and gas industry as a financial indicator of an oil and gas company’s ability to generate cash used to internally fund exploration and development activities and to service debt. Discretionary cash flow is not a measure of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net cash flow provided by operating activities. In addition, since discretionary cash flow is not a term defined by GAAP, it might not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nFor further information, contact: Matt Quantz, Manager - Corporate Communications (337) 232-7028, www.petroquest.com\nSource:PetroQuest Energy, Inc.",
