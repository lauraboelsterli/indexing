    "text": "RESTON, Va., Specialists On Call , the leader in acute care telemedicine, today announced it has changed its corporate name to SOC Telemed (SOC). The new brand reflects the company's broad range of telemedicine expertise and its commitment to improving clinical, operational and financial outcomes for healthcare organizations in a measurable way.\nEvolution Driven by Innovation\nFounded by physicians in 2004, Specialists On Call began as a clinical services telemedicine group passionate about patient care. That passion heightened across the years as the lessons of growth strengthened the company's approach and led to the creation of a robust telemedicine infrastructure to effectively serve partners' needs in a scalable, turnkey manner. Today, SOC is the largest technology-driven acute care telemedicine solutions provider for U.S. hospitals and health systems. SOC's industry-leading network of skilled, dedicated, board-certified physicians have deep clinical expertise and telemedicine experience that includes nearly 500,000 virtual consultations.\n\"We are proud to have established a strong brand recognition for providing world-class clinicians to hundreds of hospitals and health systems in the U.S., but over time we have significantly expanded into a leading telemedicine platform with multiple clinical service lines,\" said Hammad Shah, CEO of SOC Telemed. \"We are pleased to rebrand as SOC Telemed, which pays homage to our roots while reflecting the breadth of telemedicine solutions we provide today.\"\nEnterprise Solution Across the Continuum of Care\nIn conjunction with the corporate name change, SOC today announced the launch of its telemedicine technology platform, Telemed IQ, as an enterprise offering — allowing hospitals, health systems, and other healthcare organizations the ability to power their telemedicine programs with their own clinical team or in conjunction with SOC clinicians.\nTelemed IQ is an integrated solution for optimizing healthcare delivery that is based on clinical and operational realities. The solution is hardware agnostic and includes 24/7 operations support, clinical workflow optimization, clinical resource management, analytics, and predictive modeling. Aligned with clinical, operational, and financial goals, Telemed IQ enables better outcomes, optimizes clinician resources, increases access to care, and as a result, is good for patient care and enables opportunities for efficiencies and increased growth.\nTechnology has been at the forefront of SOC's journey. \"We initially built our technology to power our own in-house clinical practices, then continued to invest in and innovate our solution – which is presently in use in over 450 hospitals across the county,\" explained Shah. \"Based on real-world clinical and operational use cases, our platform is battle-tested and the cornerstone of our evidence-based approach to building successful and sustainable telemedicine programs.\"\nAbout SOC Telemed\nSOC Telemed (SOC) is the largest national provider of telemedicine technology and solutions to hospitals, health systems, post-acute providers, physician networks, value-based care organizations, and health plans. Built on proven and scalable infrastructure as an enterprise-wide solution, SOC's technology platform, Telemed IQ, rapidly deploys and seamlessly optimizes telemedicine programs across the continuum of care. SOC provides a supportive and dedicated partner presence, virtually delivering patient care through teleNeurology, telePsychiatry and teleICU as well as enabling healthcare organizations to build sustainable telemedicine programs in any clinical specialty.
