    "text": "0 COMMENTS Huge Chief Executive and Co-Founder Aaron Shapiro is stepping down after 13 years overseeing the growth of the Interpublic Group IPG 0.79% -owned digital agency.\nMr. Shapiro plans to depart in May for a new venture, the company said in a statement. Michael Koziol, international president at Huge, will replace him as CEO.\n“Over the last 13 years, the agency has grown from a small start-up to a 1,500, 12 office global organization,” said IPG CEO Michael Roth in the statement. “This trajectory is due in large part to Aaron’s vision and his ability to build a forward-thinking organization. We wish Aaron the best going forward and thank him for all his contributions.”\nHuge, a Brooklyn-based digital agency, has grown steadily on the back of large-scale projects, such as helping clients build websites, revamp their technology systems and create new brands and digital products. The shop works with big-name brands like McDonald’s , Hulu and Google. It also has a separate group called Elephant to service Apple and other clients.\nPrior to Huge, Mr. Shapiro held various roles in venture capital, management consulting and marketing. He was co-founder and CEO of Silverpop, an email marketing company acquired by IBM .\nSince joining Huge five years ago, Mr. Koziol co-founded the company’s Atlanta office, which became a hub for retail experience design and other digital work. He was promoted to international president last year. Prior to Huge, he produced original and branded entertainment content for a variety of companies. Earlier in his career, he co-founded Ant Farm Interactive, a digital agency that was acquired by Nurun in 2004.\nWrite to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com",
