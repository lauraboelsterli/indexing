    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An unidentified adult man was wounded along the north fence line of the White House on Saturday in what District of Columbia police said was being investigated as a self-inflicted shooting.\nFILE PHOTO: A view of the White House is seen through the front gates in Washington, U.S., September 10, 2007. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo President Donald Trump was away in Florida. There were no other injuries in the incident, police said.\n“We’re investigating reports that he shot himself,” but this had not been clearly established, said a police spokeswoman.\n“Our natural death squad is on the scene,” police said.\nPedestrian and vehicle traffic around the White House was blocked off by police, which is routine in such incidents.\nReporting by Mike Stone; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Matthew Lewis\n ",
