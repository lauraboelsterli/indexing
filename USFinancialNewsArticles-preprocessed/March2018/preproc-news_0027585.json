Forward-looking statements give expectations, intentions, beliefs or forecasts of future events or otherwise for the future, and can be identified by the fact that they relate to future actions, performance or results rather than relating strictly to historical or current facts. Words such as “believe(s),” “goal(s),” “target(s),” “estimate(s),” “anticipate(s),” “forecast(s),” “project(s),” “plan(s),” “intend(s),” “expect(s),” “might,” “may,” “could” and variations of such words and other words and expressions of similar meaning are intended to identify such . However, the absence of such words or other words and expressions of similar meaning does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking.\nAny or all may turn out to be wrong, and, accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements. Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict, and are not guarantees or assurances of future performance. No assurances can be given that the results and financial condition contemplated in any will be achieved or will be achieved in any particular timetable. Forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict, and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties that may be important in determining actual future results and financial condition. The general factors that could cause actual results and financial condition to expressed or implied include, without limitation, the following: (a) the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent to the consummation of the proposed merger transaction involving Kemper Corporation (the “Company”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and Infinity Property and Casualty Corporation (“Infinity”), in which a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company will merge with and into Infinity, with Infinity surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”), including, without limitation, the receipt of stockholder and regulatory approvals (including approvals, authorizations and clearance by insurance regulators necessary to complete the Merger) on the terms desired or anticipated (and the risk that such approvals may result in the imposition of conditions that could adversely affect the combined company or the expected benefits of the Merger); (b) unanticipated difficulties or expenditures relating to the Merger; (c) risks relating to the value of the shares of the Company’s common stock to be issued in the Merger; (d) disruptions of the Company’s and Infinity’s current plans, operations and relationships with third persons caused by the announcement and pendency of the Merger, including, without limitation, the ability of the combined company to hire and retain any personnel; (e) legal proceedings that may be instituted against the Company and Infinity following announcement of the Merger; and (f) those factors listed in annual, quarterly and periodic reports filed by the Company and Infinity with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), whether or not related to the Merger.\nThe Company assumes no, and expressly disclaims any, duty or obligation to update or correct any forward-looking statement as a result of events, changes, effects, states of facts, conditions, circumstances, occurrences or developments subsequent to the date of this press release or otherwise, except as required by law. Readers are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures the Company makes on related subjects in its filings with the SEC.\nAdditional Information Regarding the Transaction and Where to Find It\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or a solicitation of any vote or approval. This communication is being made in respect of the Merger, among other things. The proposed issuance of shares of Company common stock in connection with the Merger will be submitted to the stockholders of the Company for their consideration, and the proposed Merger will be submitted to the shareholders of Infinity for their consideration.
