    "text": "LONDON, March 5 (Reuters) - The Islamic Development Bank (IDB), the largest development organisation in the Muslim world, is aiming to issue a benchmark-sized green sukuk this year to finance renewable energy projects, the bank’s vice president said on Monday.\n“Our objective would be to get a benchmark, so a billion U.S. dollars, but the projects may not be that size ... we may just do a smaller one,” Zamir Iqbal, vice president finance and chief financial officer of the IDB, told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference at the London Stock Exchange.\n“I hope it will be this year,” he said, adding the bank was looking at renewable energy projects in Morocco and Turkey.
