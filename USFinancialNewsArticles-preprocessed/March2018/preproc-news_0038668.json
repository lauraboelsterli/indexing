Another factor driving the positive result was the release of inactive workers' severance funds (FGTS) accounts, which helped boost household consumption, decrease indebtedness and promote credit recovery. The stability in debt servicing percentage and low household debt levels favor fresh borrowings. Physical sales in the Company's Wood Segment, considering both domestic and export markets, advanced 10.8% in 4Q17 and 21% in 2017. \"The Company believes and is confident in the new business environment, and is continuing the actions aimed at driving domestic and export sales, while reducing expenses and streamlining processes,\" said José Antônio Goulart de Carvalho, Executive Vice-President and Investor Relations Officer.\n4Q17 Highlights\nNet Revenue of R$318.3 million (+11.9%) Recurring EBITDA of R$59.5 million (+27.3%), with margin of 18.7% Recurring Net Income of R$18.6 million (+32.8%)\nEvent after the Reporting Period\nAcquisition of the Hardboard production unit from Duratex in the city of Botucatu, state of São Paulo, for an expansion of more than 80% in the installed production capacity of the product.
