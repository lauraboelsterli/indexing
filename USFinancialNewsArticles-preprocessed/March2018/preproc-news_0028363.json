(NYSE: CWH) (“Camping World”), the nation’s largest network of RV-centric retail locations, announced that an agreement has been signed to acquire River City Recreation World located in Sherwood, Arkansas.\n“I always look for three things: People, Process and Product in relation to enhancing our Camping World presence, all of which are exemplified by River City RV,” said Marcus Lemonis, Chairman of Camping World Holdings. “Our goal with this acquisition is to add more quality manufacturers and brands, increase our presence in the market and grow the workforce.”\nThe acquisition of River City Recreation World is in line with Camping World’s future growth plans and the company expects to soon announce several additional markets of expansion throughout the country in 2018.\nCamping World currently operates two locations in Arkansas, in Lowell and North Little Rock, with both locations specializing in service, RV sales and retail accessories.
