    "text": "March 30, 2018 / 12:11 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Real's Ramos, Isco ruled out of Las Palmas game - Zidane Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nMADRID (Reuters) - Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos and midfielder Isco are not fit to face Las Palmas in La Liga and coach Zinedine Zidane refused to say whether top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo will make the trip the Canary Islands. Soccer Football - International Friendly - Spain vs Argentina - Wanda Metropolitano, Madrid, Spain - March 27, 2018 Spain's Sergio Ramos reacts REUTERS/Juan Medina \nIsco has not trained due to a back problem since scoring a hat-trick in Spain’s 6-1 hammering of Argentina on Tuesday and defender Ramos also missed practice the day before the game against relegation-threatened Las Palmas. \n“Ramos and Isco are both feeling discomfort at the moment and therefore they cannot travel with us, but you’ll have to wait and see about the rest of the squad,” Zidane told a news conference on Friday. Soccer Football - International Friendly - Spain vs Argentina - Wanda Metropolitano, Madrid, Spain - March 27, 2018 Spain's Isco celebrates scoring their third goal REUTERS/Juan Medina \nSpanish newspaper Marca reported that Ronaldo had agreed to rest against Las Palmas after playing twice for Portugal during the international break in order to prepare for Tuesday’s Champions League quarter-final first leg at Juventus. Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - Real Madrid vs Girona - Santiago Bernabeu, Madrid, Spain - March 18, 2018 Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane before the match REUTERS/Sergio Perez \nIsco has started only 18 of 29 league games this season and raised doubts about his future at Real after playing for Spain. \n“At Real Madrid I don’t have the kind of confidence that a footballer needs,” he said. \nZidane, however, is not concerned. \n“Everyone can interpret his words however they like but I’m not bothered by them,” the Frenchman said. “Perhaps he’s not happy as he doesn’t play as often for us as for Spain and he wants to play more but he’s very important to us.” \nReal are third in the La Liga standings on 60 points, four behind second-placed Atletico Madrid and 15 adrift of runaway leaders Barcelona.
