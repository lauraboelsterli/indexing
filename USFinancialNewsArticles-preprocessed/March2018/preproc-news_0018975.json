    "text": "TORONTO, March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- European Commercial Real Estate Investment Trust (“ECREIT”) (TSX-V:ERE.UN) announced today its regular quarterly cash distribution, in respect of Q1 2018, of $0.0875 per unit of ECREIT (a “Unit”), and per Class B limited partnership unit of ECRE Limited Partnership (a “Class B LP Unit”), being equivalent to $0.35 per Unit annualized. The distribution will be payable to eligible, non-waiving holders of the Units and Class B LP Units (the “Unitholders”) of record on March 29, 2018, with payment on April 16, 2018. ECREIT’s management and Board of Trustees have agreed to initially waive receipt of certain cash distributions subject to certain conditions.\nAs previously disclosed, effective September 15, 2017 ECREIT implemented a Distribution Reinvestment Plan (“DRIP”) whereby eligible Unitholders can elect to have their quarterly cash distributions paid in Units of ECREIT and receive a further distribution of Units with a value of up to 5.0% of the reinvested distribution.\n“We are pleased to announce our first quarterly cash distribution of 2018, a reflection of our strong growth during 2017, and the stability of our operating platform, which continues to focus on non-prime commercial real estate in select European markets,” commented Ian Dyke, Chief Financial Officer. “We remain focused on our long-term strategic objective to deliver stable and sustainable cash distributions, and capital appreciation to our Unitholders.”\nUpon payment of ECREIT’s last distribution on January 15, 2018, 36,869 Units were issued pursuant to the DRIP, of which 29% of such Units were issued to insiders of ECREIT.\nAbout European Commercial Real Estate Investment Trust\nECREIT is an unincorporated, open-ended real estate investment trust focused on aggregating a bespoke portfolio of high-quality, non-prime core commercial real estate assets in key European markets with strong fundamentals.
