    "text": "GUANGZHOU, China, March 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YY Inc. (NASDAQ:YY) (\"YY\" or the \"Company\"), a leading live streaming social media platform in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Highlights\nNet revenues increased by 46.0% to RMB3,626.5 million (US$557.4 million) from RMB2,484.2 million in the corresponding period of 2016. Net income attributable to YY increased by 29.4% to RMB740.4 million (US$113.8 million) from RMB572.3 million in the corresponding period of 2016. Non-GAAP net income attributable to YY 1 increased by 58.5% to RMB 948.9 million (US$145.8 million) from RMB598.6 million in the corresponding period of 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Highlights\nNet revenues increased by 41.3% to RMB11,594.8 million (US$1,782.1 million) from RMB8,204.1 million in 2016. Net income attributable to YY increased by 63.6% to RMB2,493.2 million (US$383.2 million) from RMB1,523.9 million in 2016. Non-GAAP net income attributable to YY increased by 63.6% to RMB2,750.9 million (US$422.8 million) from RMB1,681.2 million in 2016.\n“We are delighted to conclude 2017 with robust growth momentum in both operating and financial performance,” stated Mr. David Xueling Li, Chairman and acting Chief Executive Officer of YY, “In the fourth quarter of 2017, driven by both YY Live and Huya, our mobile live streaming monthly active users (MAU) increased by 36.6% year over year to 76.5 million, and our total live streaming paying users increased by 25.0% year over year to 6.5 million. This further demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our operational capabilities in our live streaming business. For YY Live in particular, we continued our efforts in content enrichment and product innovation by incorporating additional live streaming content and continuously launching new features on our platform, such as a series of casual games. Looking ahead, we will continue to further expand our product offerings and solidify our market leading position to capture the opportunities in China’s rapid growing live streaming industry.”\nMr. Bing Jin, Chief Financial Officer of YY, further commented, “We are pleased to once again deliver strong financial results in the fourth quarter of 2017. Our total net revenues increased by 46.0% year over year to RMB3,626.5 million, exceeding both our previous guidance and street consensus. Our revenue growth was primarily driven by the robust growth of our live streaming revenues, which increased by 51.9% year over year to RMB3,368.5 million with RMB2,675.8 million coming from YY Live. Huya recently submitted a draft registration statement on a confidential basis to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Committee for a possible initial public offering in the U.S. to attain its own group of investors to fund its long-term growth. We remain confident that we have the right strategy in place to drive our financial performance and sustain our rapid growth for the coming quarters and years.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nNET REVENUES\nNet revenues increased by 46.0% to RMB3,626.5 million (US$557.4 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB2,484.2 million in the corresponding period of 2016, primarily driven by the increase in live streaming revenues. Live streaming revenues increased by 51.9% to RMB3,368.5 million (US$517.7 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB2,218.2 million in the corresponding period of 2016.

The increase in revenue-sharing fees and content costs paid to performers, guilds, and content providers was in line with the increase in revenues. In addition, bandwidth costs increased to RMB 181.2 million (US$27.8 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB168.9 million in the corresponding period of 2016, primarily reflecting continued user base expansion and live streaming quality improvements but largely offset by the Company’s improved efficiency and pricing terms.\nGross profit increased by 54.7% to RMB1,429.9 million (US$219.8 million) in the fourth quarter of 2017 from RMB924.6 million in the corresponding period of 2016.

These statements are made under the “safe harbor” provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as “will,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “future,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates” and similar statements. Among other things, the business outlook and quotations from management in this announcement, as well as YY's strategic and operational plans, contain forward-looking statements. YY may also make written or oral forward-looking statements in its periodic reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), in its annual report to shareholders, in press releases and other written materials and in oral statements made by its officers, directors or employees to third parties. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about YY’s beliefs and expectations, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. A number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement, including but not limited to the following: YY’s goals and strategies; YY's future business development, results of operations and financial condition; the expected growth of the online communication social platform market in China; the expectation regarding the rate at which to gain active users, especially paying users; YY’s ability to monetize the user base; fluctuations in general economic and business conditions in China and assumptions underlying or related to any of the foregoing. Further information regarding these and other risks is included in YY’s filings with the SEC. All information provided in this press release and in the attachments is as of the date of this press release, and YY does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement, except as required under applicable law.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe unaudited condensed consolidated financial information is prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), except that the consolidated statement of changes in shareholders’ equity, consolidated statements of cash flows, and the detailed notes have not been presented. YY uses non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP net income attributable to YY Inc . , non-GAAP net margin, non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders, and basic and diluted non-GAAP net income per ADS, which are non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP operating income is operating income excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP operating margin is non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of net revenues. Non-GAAP net income attributable to YY Inc. is net income attributable to YY Inc. excluding share-based compensation expenses. Non-GAAP net margin is non-GAAP net income attributable to YY Inc. as a percentage of net revenues. Non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders is net income attributable to common shareholders excluding share-based compensation expenses. Basic and diluted non-GAAP net income per ADS is non-GAAP net income attributable to common shareholders divided by weighted average number of ADS used in the calculation of basic and diluted net income per ADS. The Company believes that separate analysis and exclusion of the non-cash impact of share-based compensation adds clarity to the constituent parts of its performance. The Company reviews these non-GAAP financial measures together with GAAP financial measures to obtain a better understanding of its operating performance. It uses the non-GAAP financial measure for planning, forecasting and measuring results against the forecast. The Company believes that non-GAAP financial measure is useful supplemental information for investors and analysts to assess its operating performance without the effect of non-cash share-based compensation expenses, which have been and will continue to be significant recurring expenses in its business. However, the use of non-GAAP financial measures has material limitations as an analytical tool. One of the limitations of using non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not include all items that impact the Company’s net income for the period. In addition, because non-GAAP financial measures are not measured in the same manner by all companies, they may not be comparable to other similar titled measures used by other companies. In light of the foregoing limitations, you should not consider non-GAAP financial measure in isolation from or as an alternative to the financial measure prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the table captioned “YY Inc. Reconciliations of GAAP and Non-GAAP Results” near the end of this release.\nInvestor Relations Contact\nYY Inc.\nMatthew Zhao\nTel: +86 (20) 8212-0000\nEmail: IR@YY.com\nICR, Inc.\nJack Wang\nTel: +1 (646) 915-1611\nEmail: IR@YY.com\n1 Non-GAAP net income attributable to YY Inc. is a non-GAAP financial measure, which is defined as net income attributable to YY Inc. excluding share-based compensation expenses.
