    "text": "GDP outlook China could target broad range of US businesses if trade spat worsens: China Daily China could target a broad range of U.S. businesses and even services if the trade conflict with the United States escalates, the China Daily newspaper said in an editorial. The China Daily on Thursday quoted Chinese Premier Li Keqiang as telling a U.S. Congressional delegation this week that China was open to dialogue but \"fully prepared with countermeasures\". Published 16 Hours Ago Reuters Dan Koeck | Reuters A warehouse of processed soybeans ready for shipment at Peterson Farms Seed facility in Fargo, North Dakota. \nChina could target a broad range of U.S. businesses from agriculture to aircraft, autos, semiconductors and even services if the trade conflict with the United States escalates, the China Daily newspaper said in an editorial on Thursday. \nTrade tension has been growing between the world's top two economies after U.S. President Donald Trump last Friday moved to impose up to $60 billion in tariffs on some Chinese imports, promoting warnings from Beijing it will retaliate with duties of up to $3 billion of U.S. imports even as it urged Washington to \"pull back from the brink.\" \nOn Wednesday, Trump's top trade envoy said he would give China a 60-day window before tariffs on Chinese goods take effect, but added that it would take years to bring the two countries' trading relationship \"to a good place.\" \nThe China Daily on Thursday quoted Chinese Premier Li Keqiang as telling a U.S. Congressional delegation this week that China was open to dialogue but \"fully prepared with countermeasures\". \nIt warned that if the conflict continued to escalate \"China could consider taking reciprocal measures against U.S. imports of agricultural products besides soybeans, as well as aircraft, automobiles and semiconductors.\" \n\"And should the Trump administration further obstruct Chinese investments in the U.S., even tougher measures such as restrictions on imports of U.S. services and similar investment reviews would likely be on the table,\" it said. \nSeparately, Hong Kong's South China Morning Post reported on Thursday that U.S. and Chinese officials had been holding talks to shield American soybeans and other agricultural products from trade sanctions.",
