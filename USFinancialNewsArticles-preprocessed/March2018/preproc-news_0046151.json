    "text": "March 27, 2018 / 9:07 PM / Updated 17 hours ago Documentary maker Alex Gibney tees up new Tiger Woods biography Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Oscar-winning filmmaker Alex Gibney is to put golfer Tiger Woods under the microscope in an upcoming documentary series based on a new biography of the 14-time major winner, Gibney’s company Jigsaw Productions said on Tuesday. FILE PHOTO: Tiger Woods plays his shot from the 11th tee during the final round of the Farmers Insurance Open golf tournament at Torrey Pines Municipal Golf Course in San Diego, California, U.S., January 28, 2018. Mandatory Credit: Orlando Ramirez-USA TODAY Sports/File Photo \nGibney will use journalists Jeff Benedict and Armen Keteyian’s biography, “Tiger Woods”, which was also released on Tuesday, as a foundation for the series. \nJigsaw did not say when production of the series will begin, and it has yet to be picked up by a distributor. \nWoods, 42, the greatest golfer of his generation who closely guards his personal life and highly crafted image, is in the midst of his latest comeback from injury. \nWoods did not speak with the biography’s authors but did allow his chiropractor to speak on the record. \nThe book, which is published by CBS Corp’s Simon & Schuster, sits in the top 40 on Amazon’s best seller list and has so far received favorable reviews. \nIt examines Woods’ life as a closely managed introverted child prodigy to a mixed-race global marketing phenomenon, and his mid-career fall from grace as a string of affairs and injuries took a toll on his image and performance. \nGibney’s projects include scripted Hulu miniseries “The Looming Tower” and 2015 HBO Scientology documentary “Going Clear.” He won an Oscar in 2008 for his Afghan war documentary “Taxi to the Dark Side.” Slideshow (2 Images)",
