    "text": "March 2, 2018 / 11:05 AM / Updated 33 minutes ago Cryptocurrency rules will be done country-by-country at first-Carney Reuters Staff 1 Min Read LONDON, March 2 (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said that rules for governing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin were likely to be introduced on a country-by-country basis before any international push. “These are national issues. I suspect they will remain national issues for some time,” Carney, who is also chair of a global financial regulation body, the Financial Stability Board, said on Friday. “I would have greater expectation of a series of national steps rather than some big coordinated approach,” he said in response to a question after delivering a speech on the future of crypto-currencies.
