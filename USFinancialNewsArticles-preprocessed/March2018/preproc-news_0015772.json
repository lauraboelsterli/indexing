It said it would propose a divided of 4 euros per common share.\nResearch and development expenditure rose by 18.3 percent last year to 6.1 billion euros, as the German carmaker invests in electric and autonomous vehicle technologies.\nThe BMW brand reported car sales of 2.09 million vehicles last year but rival Mercedes-Benz saw higher sales of 2.29 million passenger cars.\nOverall automotive sales, including the Mini and Rolls-Royce brands, rose 4.1 percent to 2.46 million vehicles, BMW said. Deliveries electric and hybrid vehicles jumped by 65.6 percent to 103,080 units.\nBMW intends to increase the sales volume of electrified vehicles to at least 140,000 units in 2018 and bring more than half a million electrified vehicles on to the roads by the end of 2019, the company said.
