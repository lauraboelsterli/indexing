United Nations Syria envoy's Special Adviser Jan Egeland attends a briefing after the meeting of the humanitarian task force on Syria in Geneva, Switzerland February 1, 2018 REUTERS/Denis Balibouse Jan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said it was not too late for negotiations to avoid major bloodshed in the towns of Idlib, Deraa and Afrin, and the United Nations hoped a new notification system for the coordinates of Syrian hospitals would cut the number of air strikes on medical facilities.
