Police said they were searching for the driver. \nAt least three of the other victims had life-threatening wounds, police said. \n“Driver of vehicle in a physical altercation with five subjects and struck five subjects with his vehicle,” San Francisco police said in a statement. \nIt was not clear what might have sparked the dispute between the driver and the people in the street. Police declined to immediately provide further details. \nA witness said the driver got out of a van with an ax during the altercation, before getting back into the vehicle and driving it into people on the sidewalk, according to the San Francisco affiliate for NBC. \nIn video from NBC Bay Area, paramedics and police could be seen attending to a person lying on the sidewalk. \nPaul Lim, who works at a business in the area, told the San Francisco Chronicle he saw the aftermath of the incident. \n“I saw two lifeless people from across the street,” Lim told the newspaper. “Another one was being consoled by a friend screaming for help. And another one was moving very slowly.” Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles and Gina Cherelus in New York; Editing by Tom Brown and Grant McCool",
