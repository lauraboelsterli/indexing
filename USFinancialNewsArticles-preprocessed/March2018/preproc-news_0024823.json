    "text": "New redevelopment to be rebranded to Uptown\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- RD Management LLC , one of the nation’s largest privately held real-estate development and management organizations, announced today the acquisition of the Sears property at University Mall in Tampa, Florida, placing the nearly 100-acre retail property under the control of one owner for the first time since the tract was originally assembled in the early 1970s. As part of its redevelopment, RD Management will rebrand and rename University Mall to Uptown.\nSears’ retail business will continue to operate on its normal schedule as the property transforms from a traditional, enclosed mall into a vibrant mixed-use, city center. When complete, Uptown, an anchor member of Tampa’s !p (formerly known as Tampa Innovation Alliance), will be a multi-story, open-air, development showcasing retail, entertainment, hospitality, education, medical, office, and residential uses.\n“This mall is a vital part of Tampa’s commercial corridor. Uptown will provide shopping experiences that today’s retailers seek,” said Chris Bowen, RD Management’s Chief Development Strategist for the redevelopment project. “As we develop Uptown, it is our vision that it will generate a renaissance of the North Tampa market creating Tampa’s Uptown District.”\nLocated in the northeast quadrant of the Tampa trade area with frontage on East Fowler Avenue and Club Drive, the 1.3 million-square-foot shopping center is easily accessible by major highways I-275 and I-75. Connected by University Square Drive, is just a stone’s throw away from the University of South Florida’s main campus with more than 47,000 students and 16,000 faculty and staff members. It’s also in close proximity to major employers such as the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute , Shriner’s Hospital for Children , and Busch Gardens Tampa Bay . Tenants include Dillard’s , Burlington , Sears , Grand’s, Studio Movie Grill , Portillo's , and Miller's Ale House .\n“The acquisition of the Sears property marks a significant milestone in the transformation of the entire University Mall site,” said Roger Hirschhorn, COO RD Management. “We are excited to include Sears in the dynamic, mixed-use center we’ve always envisioned for this extraordinary community of educators, scientists, caregivers, students, business people, and hardworking and inspiring neighbors.”\nUniversity Mall is one of 12 properties owned by RD Management across Florida, and one of more than 150 properties in its national portfolio.
