    "text": "2017 revenues of $50 million include a 74% increase in product sales\nIntroduces 2018 financial guidance\nConference call begins at 4:30 pm Eastern time today\nAccompanying slide presentation available on Investor section of company website\nREDWOOD CITY, Calif., Codexis, Inc. (NASDAQ:CDXS), a leading protein engineering company, announces financial results for the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2017, provides a business update and introduces 2018 financial guidance.\n“We closed out an exceptional year with fourth quarter revenues exceeding $21 million, more than double third quarter revenues,” said Codexis President and CEO John Nicols. “Revenues for 2017 of $50 million increased slightly over 2016 and met our annual guidance as we replaced more than $22 million of non-recurring revenue related to technology transfers. Product sales of $27 million increased 74% and reached the top of our guidance range, and product gross margin of 46% exceeded our guidance range. Our many 2017 accomplishments include our new agreement with Nestlé Health Science, which validated the use of our protein engineering technology platform for biotherapeutic drug discovery, and our second agreement with Tate & Lyle, which further strengthened our partnership with this world leader in food ingredients.\n“Our growth momentum and many accomplishments support another year of exceptional growth with 2018 revenues expected to be $60 million to $63 million,” said Nicols. “Our outlook features continued solid performance from our core business, growth from our Nestlé Health Science and Tate & Lyle partnerships, advancement of our biotherapeutic pipeline beyond phenylketonuria (PKU) disease, the first year of significant backend revenue from our CodeEvolver® technology platform license deals, and initial sales of our new high-performing enzymes into the molecular diagnostics industry.”\nFourth Quarter Financial Highlights\nTotal revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 118% to $21.7 million from $10.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Product sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 78% to $7.6 million from $4.2 million for the prior-year period, primarily due to higher demand for enzymes. Research and development (R&D) revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 132% to $12.4 million from $5.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, with the increase mainly attributable to Nestlé Health Science. Revenue from the revenue-sharing arrangement with Exela PharmSci for sales of the argatroban injectable drug was $1.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $0.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, with the increase primarily due to non-recurring revenue of $1.5 million in connection with the termination of our revenue sharing arrangement with Exela and granting of an exclusive license to Exela.\nGross margin on product sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased to 53% from 46% for the fourth quarter of 2016, mainly due to an increase in sales of higher-margin products.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $9.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with $6.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, with the increase due primarily to higher outside services expenses related to CDX-6114, our lead biotherapeutic candidate being developed for the treatment of PKU for which we entered into a license agreement with Nestlé Health Science, and increased costs associated with higher headcount, partially offset by the absence of amortization of intangibles. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $7.9 million compared with $7.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, due primarily to an increase in outside services and legal fees and increased costs associated with higher headcount, partially offset by lower depreciation expense.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.0 million, or $0.02 per basic and diluted share, compared with a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2016 of $5.3 million, or $0.13 per basic and diluted share. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.1 million, or $0.06 per basic and diluted share, compared with a non-GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of 2016 of $2.8 million, or $0.07 per basic and diluted share. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided below.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenues for 2017 were $50.0 million, up 2.4% from $48.8 million for 2016. Total revenues for 2017 included $26.7 million in product sales, $20.7 million in R&D revenue and $2.6 million from the revenue-sharing arrangement with Exela.\nGross margin on product sales for 2017 was 46% compared with 36% for 2016, due to an increase in sales of higher-margin products.\nR&D expenses for 2017 were $29.7 million compared with $22.2 million for 2016, with the increase primarily due to higher outside service fees related to CDX-6114 and increased costs associated with higher headcount, partially offset by lower amortization expense. SG&A expenses for 2017 were $29.0 million compared with $25.4 million for the prior year, with the increase primarily due to increases in legal expenses and costs associated with higher headcount and higher outside services, partially offset by lower depreciation expense.\nThe net loss for 2017 was $23.0 million, or $0.50 per basic and diluted share, compared with a net loss for 2016 of $8.6 million, or $0.21 per basic and diluted share. The non-GAAP net loss for 2017 was $14.9 million, or $0.32 per basic and diluted share, compared with non-GAAP net income for 2016 of $1.7 million, or $0.04 per basic and diluted share. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided below.\nCash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 were $31.2 million, compared with $19.2 million as of December 31, 2016.\n2018 Financial Outlook\nCodexis is introducing financial guidance for 2018, as follows:\nTotal revenues are expected to be $60 million to $63 million, a 20% to 26% increase over 2017; Product sales are expected to be $25 million to $28 million; and Gross margin on product sales is expected to be 45% to 48%.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nConsolidated financial information has been presented in accordance with GAAP as well as on a non-GAAP basis. On a non-GAAP basis, financial measures exclude non-cash items such as depreciation expense, intangible asset amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP financial measures presented are: non-GAAP net income or loss, non-GAAP net income or loss per share (basic and diluted) and non-GAAP operating expenses, including non-GAAP research and development expense and non-GAAP selling, general and administrative expense. Non-GAAP operating expenses exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and depreciation of fixed assets.\nCodexis management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to monitor and evaluate the Company’s operating results and trends on an ongoing basis, and internally for operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Codexis management believes the non-GAAP information is useful for investors by offering them the ability to identify trends in what management considers to be Codexis’ core operating results and to better understand how management evaluates the business. These non-GAAP measures have limitations, however, because they do not include all expense that affect Codexis. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with, and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measurements required by GAAP, and therefore these non-GAAP results should only be used for evaluation in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. A description of the non-GAAP calculations and reconciliation to comparable GAAP financial measures is provided in the accompanying table entitled “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nConference Call and Webcast\nCodexis will hold a conference call and audio webcast today beginning at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time.

We believe that eliminating this expense from our non-GAAP measures is useful to investors, because the acquisition of property and equipment, and the corresponding depreciation expense, can be inconsistent in amount and can vary from period to period.\n(b) Intangible asset amortization: we provide non-GAAP information which excludes expenses for the amortization of intangible assets which primarily relate to purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. We believe that eliminating this expense from our non-GAAP measures is useful to investors, because this expense is non-cash.\n(c) Stock-based compensation: we provide non-GAAP information which excludes expenses for stock-based compensation. We believe the exclusion of this item allows for financial results that are more indicative of our continuing operations. We also believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense provides for a better comparison of Codexis' operating results to prior periods as the calculations of stock-based compensation vary from period to period and company to company due to different valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types.\nSource:Codexis, Inc.",
