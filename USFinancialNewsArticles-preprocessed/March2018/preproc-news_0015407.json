Morgan chief Jamie Dimon said Thursday the news of Cohn leaving the administration is “unfortunate” and “terrible.” \nIn similar fashion, Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein expressed his disappointment Tuesday. \n“Gary Cohn deserves credit for serving his country in a first-class way. I’m sure I join many others who are disappointed to see him leave,” Blankfein said in a Tweet. ",
