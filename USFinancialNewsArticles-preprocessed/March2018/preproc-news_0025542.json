    "text": "CARNEGIE, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ampco-Pittsburgh Corporation (NYSE: AP) reported sales for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, of $114.4 million and $432.4 million, respectively, compared to $92.1 million and $331.9 million, respectively, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The current year periods include sales of $10.9 million and $47.2 million, respectively, associated with the November 2016 acquisition of ASW Steel Inc. (“ASW”), compared to $7.5 million in the prior year periods. In addition, the Corporation experienced higher sales of forged engineered products for the oil and gas industry and, to a lesser extent, higher sales of forged and cast mill rolls for both the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Sales in the Air and Liquid Processing segment also rose modestly compared to the respective prior year periods.\nLoss from operations for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, was $1.8 million and $9.4 million, respectively, compared to loss from operations of $39.8 million and $54.5 million for the respective prior year periods. The 2016 periods included charges for impairment of $26.7 million, primarily from the impairment of goodwill in the Forged and Cast Engineered Products reporting unit (“Impairment Charge”), a $4.6 million net charge associated primarily with revaluing the estimated liabilities and insurance receivables for asbestos litigation through 2026 (“Asbestos Charge”), and a $1.5 million reserve against a receivable from a customer who filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The full year 2016 also included significant acquisition-related expenses and integration costs. The full year 2017 includes a $1.3 million recovery associated with a customer Chapter 11 receivable.\nOther expense – net for the three months ended December 31, 2017, declined compared to the prior year, primarily due to a small foreign exchange gain in the current year versus losses in the prior year quarter. For the full year, other expense – net increased against the prior year primarily as a result of higher interest expense.\nThe income tax (provision) benefit for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, reflects an unfavorable net impact of approximately $1.6 million related to the new U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation.\nNet loss for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, was $3.2 million, or $0.26 per common share, and $12.1 million, or $0.98 per common share, respectively, compared to net loss for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, of $43.1 million, or $3.51 per common share, and $79.8 million, or $6.68 per common share, respectively. In addition to the Impairment Charge and Asbestos Charge, which impacted the full year 2016 net loss per share by $2.23 and $0.38, respectively, the full year 2016 net loss also included valuation allowances of $30.4 million against the majority of the Corporation’s deferred income tax assets, which impacted net loss per share by $2.54.\nSales for the Forged and Cast Engineered Products segment for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased 30% and 39%, respectively, versus prior year, reflecting the full period effect of the ASW acquisition, significantly higher sales of forged engineered products for the oil and gas industry, and higher sales of mill rolls to the global steel industry, primarily for hot strip mills. The segment recorded a small operating income for the quarter and an operating loss for the full year of less than $2 million. Even after considering the non-recurring Impairment Charge, acquisition-related expenses and integration costs, and a customer’s Chapter 11 receivable reserve recorded in the prior year periods, the segment’s operating performance improved significantly. This was driven by the higher sales volumes and pricing, offset in part by higher operating and raw material costs and an unfavorable absorption effect from the idling of a cast roll foundry.\nSales for the Air and Liquid Processing segment increased 5% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 4% for full year 2017 compared to the prior year periods as higher shipment volumes of custom air handlers and heat exchange coils more than offset lower shipment volumes of centrifugal pumps. The segment’s operating income rose significantly for the quarter and full year compared to prior year, given the $4.6 million Asbestos Charge recorded last year, but improved further on an operating basis from the higher shipment volumes.\nCorporate costs for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased $0.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively, compared to the comparable prior year periods as higher staffing costs associated with the Corporation’s increased scale, higher fringe benefits and higher professional fees more than offset the reduction in acquisition-related costs incurred in the prior year.\nCommenting on the quarter and full year results, John Stanik, Ampco-Pittsburgh’s Chief Executive Officer said, “Although we missed our objective of returning to operating profitability by the end of 2017, we made significant year-over-year improvement on an operational basis. We saw recovery in both the steel and fracking businesses after periods of decline, and we are addressing our process and equipment bottlenecks to meet a solid ramp-up and robust order book. I am very encouraged by our progress in Q4 and I am excited about 2018.”\nTeleconference Access\nAmpco-Pittsburgh Corporation (NYSE: AP) will hold a conference call on Wednesday, March 14, at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) to discuss its financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.
