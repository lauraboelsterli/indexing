    "text": "TORONTO, March 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SMTC Corporation (Nasdaq:SMTX), a global electronics manufacturing services provider, today announced that it has appointed Steve Waszak as Chief Financial Officer and Sr. Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions effective today. Waszak, has more than 20 years of executive experience in corporate finance, strategic development and sales leadership roles, including BTI Systems, Zetera Corporation, Sonoma Systems, Ciena Corporation and SMTEK International.\nCommenting on the CFO transition, SMTC’s CEO and President Ed Smith said, “Steve’s background of working with Tier 1 customers, success in leveraging operating costs and increasing margins in an expanding enterprise value environment should prove invaluable to SMTC. Having worked with Steve for four years at SMTEK International, I am confident that he will play a significant role as we work to increase shareholder value through advancements in our capital structure and through acquisitions and organically drive growth. We believe he is an ideal complement to our leadership team as we continue our transformation into a faster growing, more profitable and value-added end-to-end electronic manufacturing services provider.”\n“I also want to thank Roger Dunfield for his service as SMTC’s CFO. He has been a valued member of our executive team and I am pleased that he will continue to be a resource and remain employed with the company for the CFO transition and other corporate matters through June 30, 2018,” Smith added.\n“I am very excited to take on the role of CFO and work closely again with Eddie, Rich Fitzgerald and the other members of the management team to transform the company into a larger, customer-driven organization,” said Waszak. “The leadership team has the right strategy and is now well positioned to build a stronger company and create significant shareholder value.”\nWaszak joined SMTC in February 2018 as Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions. He is a veteran technology executive with an extensive track record of success in driving profitable growth through acquisitions and internally developed initiatives. Prior to SMTC, he served as CFO at Connected-Holdings, LLC, an end-to-end, vertically integrated, Internet of Things “IoT” intelligent services provider. Earlier, as CEO and President of BTI Systems, a developer of optical communication networks and data-center interconnect solutions for Web 2.0 and public cloud providers, Waszak led the company through significant customer expansion and earned a position on Deloitte’s Fast 50 list of North America’s fastest growth tech companies.\nWaszak’s C-Suite experience also includes serving as COO/CFO at Zetera Corporation and at SONOMA Systems which was acquired by Nortel Networks. Following the acquisition of Internet Photonics (a Bell Labs spin-out), where he held the position of CFO/COO, Waszak served as Vice President of Global Sales Operation for Ciena Corporation (NYSE:CIEN).\nWaszak has guided companies as a member of the Board of Directors of private entities and publicly traded SMTEK International (NASDAQ:SMTK). He also advised senior management as a member of Deloitte’s Entrepreneurial & Emerging Business Services group earlier in his career. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting from Loyola Marymount University.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe statements contained in this press release that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements which involve risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.
