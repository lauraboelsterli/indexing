(“Paychex,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) (NASDAQ:PAYX) today announced total revenue of $866.5 million for the three months ended February 28, 2018 (the “third quarter”), an increase of 9% from $795.8 million for the same period last year. The acquisition of HR Outsourcing Holdings, Inc. (“HROI”), completed during August 2017, contributed approximately 3% to the total revenue growth for the third quarter. Net income and diluted earnings per share each increased 29% to $260.4 million and $0.72 per share, respectively, for the third quarter. Adjusted net income increased 14% to $227.5 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15% to $0.63 per share for the third quarter. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter exclude the impact of the termination of certain license agreements, the impact of excess tax benefits related to employee stock-based compensation payments recognized in income taxes, and certain one-time net tax benefits recognized as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). See the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section starting on page 5 of this press release for further discussion of these non-GAAP measures.\nMartin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We continued to experience solid growth in the third quarter across all major human capital management (“HCM”) product lines. In particular, comprehensive human resource (“HR”) outsourcing solutions, retirement services, insurance services, and our time and attendance solutions have performed well. Our service delivery also remained strong as we continue to experience favorable client retention results. We benefited from the Tax Act enacted in December 2017, the most comprehensive tax reform legislation approved in more than two decades. The benefits of tax reform and the products and solutions we provide to our clients continue to strengthen and enhance our market-leading position.\nAt the end of the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Lessor Group (“Lessor”), a market-leading provider of payroll and HCM software solutions headquartered in Denmark and serving clients in Northern Europe. We believe the combination of Lessor’s payroll and HCM software products with our full-service business process outsourcing capabilities will provide a complete technology-enabled services platform in the markets they serve. We look forward to continued international market expansion and welcome all of the Lessor employees to the Paychex family.”\nPayroll service revenue was $455.0 million for the third quarter, a 2% increase compared to the same period last year. The increase was primarily driven by growth in revenue per check, which improved as a result of price increases, net of discounts.\nHuman Resource Services (“HRS”) revenue was $393.4 million for the third quarter, an increase of 17% compared to the same period last year. HRS revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in client bases across the following HCM services: comprehensive HR outsourcing services, including HROI; retirement services; time and attendance; and insurance services. Our largest HRS revenue stream is Paychex HR Services, which includes our administrative services organization and our professional employer organization (“PEO”). Demand for these services resulted in strong growth in the number of client worksite employees served. Retirement services revenue benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the asset value of participants’ funds as well as an increase in the number of plans served. Insurance services revenue benefited from an increase in the number of health and benefit applicants, coupled with higher average premiums for workers’ compensation insurance services.\nInterest on funds held for clients increased 37% to $18.1 million for the third quarter, compared to the same period last year. The increase resulted from higher average interest rates earned. The funds held for clients average investment balances increased 1% for the third quarter compared to the same period last year, primarily due to strong calendar year-end bonus payments and wage inflation, partially offset by client mix.\nAverage investment balances and interest rates are summarized below:\nFor the three months ended For the nine months ended February 28, February 28, $ in millions 2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 Change Average investment balances: Funds held for clients $ 4,551.6 $ 4,502.4 1 % $ 3,999.7 $ 3,985.0 — % Corporate investments $ 934.4 $ 833.9 12 % $ 919.3 $ 899.8 2 % Average interest rates earned\n(exclusive of net realized gains): Funds held for clients 1.6 % 1.2 % 1.5 % 1.2 % Corporate investments 1.4 % 1.1 % 1.3 % 1.1 % Total net realized gains $ 0.1 $ — $ 0.1 $ 0.1 Total expenses increased 17% to $574.0 million for the third quarter compared to the same period last year. HROI contributed approximately 5% to total expense growth for the third quarter. Compensation-related costs increased 7% as compared to the prior year period. Higher compensation was driven by higher wages together with additional investments made in employees. A one-time bonus was paid to non-management employees during the third quarter, which contributed approximately 2% to total expense growth for the third quarter. An additional one-time expense was recognized following the termination of certain license agreements, contributing approximately 7% to total expense growth for the third quarter. Investments in technology and continued growth of our combined PEO business also contributed to the overall increase in total expenses.\nOperating income decreased 5% to $292.5 million and adjusted operating income increased 6% to $325.1 million, respectively, for the third quarter compared to the same period last year. Adjusted operating income excludes the one-time charge following the termination of certain license agreements during the third quarter. Adjusted operating income, as a percent of total revenue, was 37.5% for the third quarter, compared with 38.5% for the same period last year. See the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section starting on page 5 of this press release for further discussion of this non-GAAP measure.\nOur effective income tax rate was 11.7% for the third quarter compared to 34.2% for the same period last year. The effective income tax rate for the third quarter was significantly impacted by the Tax Act. As it relates to the Tax Act, we recorded a one-time net tax benefit of $20.8 million for the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities and a net tax benefit of $36.1 million for the change in our annual effective income tax rate for the first six months of the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2018 (“fiscal 2018”). These amounts impacted diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.06 per share and $0.10 per share, respectively, for the third quarter.\nYear-To-Date Fiscal 2018 Highlights\nThe highlights for the nine months ended February 28, 2018 (the “nine months”) are as follows:\nTotal revenue increased 7% to $2.5 billion. Payroll service revenue increased 1% to $1.4 billion. HRS revenue increased 13% to $1.1 billion. HROI contributed approximately 2% to total revenue growth. Interest on funds held for clients increased 25% to $45.8 million. Operating income increased 3% to $969.7 million and adjusted operating income (1) increased 7% to $1.0 billion. The effective income tax rate was 27.7% for the nine months, compared to 34.1% for the same period last year. The effective income tax rate was significantly impacted by the one-time net tax benefit recognized for the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the enactment of the Tax Act. Net income increased 13% to $705.2 million and adjusted net income (1) increased 16% to $700.8 million. Diluted earnings per share increased 14% to $1.95 per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share (1) increased 17% to $1.94 per share.\n(1)\nAdjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not U.S. GAAP measures. Please refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section starting on the next page of this press release for a discussion of these non-GAAP measures and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures of operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share.\nFinancial Position and Liquidity\nOur financial position as of February 28, 2018 remained strong with cash and total corporate investments of $826.6 million. Our primary source of cash is generated from ongoing operations. Short-term borrowings totaled $57.7 million as of February 28, 2018. Our positive cash flows have historically allowed us to support our business and to pay substantial dividends to our stockholders. It is anticipated that cash and total corporate investments as of February 28, 2018, along with projected operating cash flows and available short-term financing, will support normal business operations, capital purchases, share repurchases, dividend payments, and business acquisitions, if any, for the foreseeable future.\nCash flows from operations were $988.9 million for the nine months, an increase of 29% from the same period last year. Operating cash flows were higher due to higher net income along with positive cash flow impacts from timing related to income taxes and PEO payroll accruals and unbilled receivables, which can fluctuate based on timing of period end compared to payroll check dates.\nCash flows from investing activities of $24.4 million for the nine months includes a net cash outflow for the acquisition of Lessor on February 28, 2018.\nDuring the nine months, we repurchased 1.6 million shares of our common stock for a total of $94.1 million. In the respective prior year period, we repurchased 2.9 million shares for a total of $166.2 million.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFor the three months ended For the nine months ended February 28, February 28, $ in millions 2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 Change Operating income $ 292.5 $ 306.6 (5) % $ 969.7 $ 940.7 3 % Non-GAAP adjustments: Termination of license\nagreements (1) 32.6 — 32.6 — Total non-GAAP adjustments 32.6 — 32.6 — Adjusted operating income $ 325.1 $ 306.6 6 % $ 1,002.3 $ 940.7 7 % Net income $ 260.4 $ 202.5 29 % $ 705.2 $ 622.0 13 % Non-GAAP adjustments: Excess tax benefit related to employee stock-based\ncompensation payments (2)\n(0.7) (3.2) (8.3) (17.3) Revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities (3) (20.8) — (20.8) — Change in annual effective income tax rate (3) (36.1) — — — Termination of license\nagreements (1) 24.7 — 24.7 — Total non-GAAP adjustments (32.9) (3.2) (4.4) (17.3) Adjusted net income $ 227.5 $ 199.3 14 % $ 700.8 $ 604.7 16 % Diluted earnings per share $ 0.72 $ 0.56 29 % $ 1.95 $ 1.71 14 % Non-GAAP adjustments: Excess tax benefit related to employee stock-based\ncompensation payments (2)\n— (0.01) (0.02) (0.05) Revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities (3) (0.06) — (0.06) — Change in annual effective income tax rate (3) (0.10) — — — Termination of license\nagreements (1) 0.07 — 0.07 — Total non-GAAP adjustments (0.09) (0.01) (0.01) (0.05) Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 0.63 $ 0.55 15 % $ 1.94 $ 1.66 17 % (1)\nAdditional expense and corresponding tax benefit recognized in the third quarter as a result of the termination of certain license agreements. This event is not expected to recur.\n(2)\nNet tax windfall or shortfall benefits related to employee stock-based compensation payments recognized in income taxes. This item is subject to volatility and will vary based on employee decisions on exercising employee stock options and fluctuations in our stock price, neither of which is within the control of management.\n(3)\nOne-time tax benefits recognized in the third quarter as a result of the Tax Act, including $20.8 million related to the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities and $36.1 million related to the change in our annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2018. The tax benefit related to the change in our annual effective tax rate represents amounts recognized in the third quarter to reflect the fiscal year-to-date effective tax rate. These events are not expected to recur.\nIn addition to reporting operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share, which are U.S. GAAP measures, we present adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP measures. We believe adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share are appropriate additional measures, as they are indicators of our core business operations performance period over period. Adjusted operating income, adjusted net income, and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not calculated through the application of GAAP and are not a required form of disclosure by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). As such, they should not be considered as a substitute for the GAAP measures of operating income, net income, and diluted earnings per share, and therefore should not be used in isolation, but in conjunction with the GAAP measures. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.\nOutlook\nOur outlook for fiscal 2018 is based upon current market, economic, and interest rate conditions continuing with no significant changes. Our guidance for fiscal 2018 has been updated from what we disclosed last quarter, now including the impact of the Tax Act and the acquisition of Lessor, and is summarized as follows:\nPayroll service revenue is anticipated to increase approximately 2%; HRS revenue is anticipated to increase in the range of 13% to 14%; Interest on funds held for clients is expected to increase in the range of 20% to 25%; Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 7%; Operating income, as a percent of total revenue, is expected to be approximately 38%; Investment income, net is expected to be approximately $8.0 million; The effective income tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 28.5% to 29%; Net income is expected to increase approximately 13% and adjusted net income (1) is expected to increase approximately 15%; and Diluted earnings per share is expected to increase in the range of 13% to 14% and adjusted diluted earnings per share (1) is expected to increase in the range of 15% to 16%.\n(1)\nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are not U.S. GAAP measures. Please refer to the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section beginning on the previous page of this press release for a discussion of these non-GAAP measures. The difference between our guidance for the GAAP measures of net income and diluted earnings per share and the related non-GAAP measures of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share is the exclusion of the impact of excess tax benefits related to employee stock-based compensation payments recognized in income taxes, the impact of termination of certain license agreements recognized during the third quarter, and certain one-time net tax benefits recognized during the third quarter as a result of the Tax Act. We have not incorporated any assumptions regarding the discrete tax item related to stock-based compensation payments in our fiscal 2018 projections for the remainder of the fiscal year, as factors impacting the amount are subject to uncertainty. The uncertainty primarily relates to employee decisions regarding exercise of stock-based awards and the market price of our common stock at the time.\nQuarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nWe anticipate filing our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (“Form 10-Q”) for the three and nine months ended February 28, 2018 within the next few days, and it will be available at our Investor Relations page .
