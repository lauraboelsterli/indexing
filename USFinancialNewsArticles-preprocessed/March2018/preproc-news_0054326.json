Transocean then settled the compulsory acquisition by delivering Consideration Shares, Exchangeable Bonds and cash consideration, as applicable, to Songa Offshore shareholders. Songa Offshore’s shares remained listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange through March 28, 2018.\nAbout Transocean\nTransocean is a leading international provider of offshore contract drilling services for oil and gas wells.
