    "text": "Updated 1 Hour Ago Getty images | Brendon Thorne \nOn Saturday, a Boeing 787 Dreamliner operated by Qantas will leave Perth, Australia and fly non-stop to London Heathrow. \nThe flight will be the first commercial passenger jet to connect the two countries directly and the 9,010 miles will take just over 17 hours to complete. \nThe flight will carry 236 passengers across business, premium economy, and economy cabins. That number has been trimmed back to allow for more fuel. \nWhile it signals a new era of efficient engines and lightweight composite structures, it will not win the title of the world's longest flight. \nCNBC takes a look at the current routes guaranteed to weary any hardened traveler. Dallas/Fort Worth — Sydney \nShortest total time: 16 hours, 50 minutes \nLength: 8,578 miles Yury Prokopenko | Getty Images \nOperated by Qantas, this flight was the first non-stop when the route started using an Airbus A380 in 2014. The return route from Sydney, however, was always non-stop, which began as far back as 2011. Houston — Sydney \nShortest total time: 17 hours, 30 minutes \nLength: 8,596 miles Tim Leviston | EyeEm | Getty Images Houston, Texas \nUnited Airlines began UA 101 in January this year, using Boeing's 787-9. Crossing the International Date Line across the Pacific Ocean, travelers arrive two days after departure. Los Angeles — Singapore \nShortest total time: 17 hours, 00 minutes \nLength: 8,770 miles Getty Images A Boeing 787 Dreamliner operated by United Airlines takes off from Los Angeles International Airport. \nUnited first operated this service in October 2017. The flight holds the distance record for any current flight flying to or from the United States. That should change when Qantas launches nonstop flights between Melbourne and San Francisco in September. Auckland — Dubai \nShortest total time: 17 hours, 05 minutes \nLength: 8,824 miles Airbus An Airbus A380 in Emirates livery. \nEmirates EK 449 is a non-stop Airbus A380 route. After departing New Zealand it is almost four hours before you even reach the east coast of Australia. Anyone who stays awake should be able to see the south coast of India before the descent into the Middle East. Perth — London Heathrow \nShortest total time: 17 hours, 20 minutes \nLength: 9,010 miles Source: Qantas The newest Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner for Sydney, Australia-based Qantas features artwork honoring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. \nThe new kid on the block. From Saturday the Boeing 787-9, operated under Qantas ' QF9 code, will be only one of two current routes to fly direct more than 9,000 miles. The Dreamliner will set off for its non-stop run to London at 6.50 p.m. AWST, reaching Heathrow at 5.10 a.m. London time the following day. Auckland — Doha \nShortest total time: 17 hours, 40 minutes \nLength: 9,032 miles Leslie Josephs | CNBC A Qatar Airways Boeing 777 In New York. \nThe longest current flight you can take flies you from New Zealand to the capital of Qatar. A Boeing 777-200LR performs the haul, which was first completed in February 2017. \nIt may not have long at the top though. Singapore Airlines is soon to take delivery of the ultra-long range Airbus A350-900ULR. With it, it wants to relaunch the 9,537 mile Singapore to New York route. Airbus estimates that will take up to 19 hours.",
