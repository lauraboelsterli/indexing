Furthermore we have recently been granted Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) certification by the Israel Ministry of Health (MoH) for our Israeli contract manufacturing facility. \"\n\"We are building a world class team at BrainStorm and made a number of senior management appointments throughout 2017 including Ralph Z.
