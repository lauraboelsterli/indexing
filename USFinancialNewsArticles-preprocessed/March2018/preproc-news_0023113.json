    "text": "Jalen Brunson had 31 points, six rebounds and four assists and Mikal Bridges added 25 points as the No. 2 Villanova Wildcats won the Big East tournament with a 76-66 overtime win over the Providence Friars on Saturday night at Madison Square Garden in New York.\nThe Wildcats outscored Providence 16-6 in the five-minute overtime period, with Bridges hitting two 3-pointers, Brunson making a dunk and a layup and Donte DiVencenzo adding a layup and a pair of free throws.\nAlpha Diallo had 22 points and 10 rebounds and Kyron Cartwright added 19 points to lead the Friars.\nVillanova won its fifth straight game and further cemented a No. 1 seeding in the NCAA Tournament, and Providence helped its cause for an at-large bid.\nThe Wildcats led by as much as 12 in the second half and held a 51-41 advantage with 11:11 left in the game, but Providence stormed back behind Cartwright.\nCartwright had eight straight points, including two 3-pointers, in a 92 second run midway through the second half to get the Friars back into the game.\nCartwright delivered again late, hitting a jumper with 1:42 left in the game and then finding Alpha Diallo for a layup with 41 seconds left to take a 60-58 lead. Brunson knotted the game at 60 with a pair of free throws to force overtime.\nThe Wildcats shot just 43.8 percent from the field but held Providence to 37.7 percent field-goal shooting and 26.1 percent from 3-point range.\nVillanova jumped to a 9-2 lead to start the game and led by as much as 10 in the first half before Providence made a run at then end to cut the halftime deficit to 31-27.\nBrunson had 13 first-half points and Bridges had 12, as the duo combined for 9-of-14 shooting.\nDiallo had 11 points in the first half for Providence, which helped its cause with a 19-14 rebounding advantage.\nThe Wildcats dominated the boards down the stretch, however, and finished with a 41-36 advantage on the glass, with Eric Paschall leading the way with 13 rebounds.\nThe game was a rematch of the two teams’ Feb. 15 game, which Providence won 76-71 by holding Brunson to 14 points.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
