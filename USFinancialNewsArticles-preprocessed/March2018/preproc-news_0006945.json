The Company reported GAAP net income of $30.4 million or $1.07 per diluted common share and Core Earnings (1) of $32.1 million or $1.13 per diluted common share for the full-year of 2017. In addition, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2018 dividend of $0.28 per common share payable on April 17, 2018 to common stockholders of record on March 29, 2018, which is the third consecutive annual dividend increase of $0.01 per common share.\n“We had a strong finish to 2017 with more than $400 million of originations in the fourth quarter and a record $956 million for the full year, reflecting progress on recent initiatives to enhance our market coverage and origination capabilities,” said Jamie Henderson, President and Chief Executive Officer of ACRE. “Based in part upon an improved earnings outlook for 2018, our board of directors has authorized an increase in our first quarter dividend to $0.28 per common share.”\n“Throughout 2017, we continued to work on improving the cost and efficient use of our capital to enhance our profitability. During the year, we meaningfully reduced the pricing on our $110 million secured term loan, closed an attractively priced $273 million privately placed securitization and added $236 million of warehouse capacity,” said Tae-Sik Yoon, Chief Financial Officer of ACRE. “Going forward, our goal will be to maintain near full deployment of our capital, which we believe will result in higher and more consistent earnings in 2018. In addition, given that 99% of our loans as of December 31, 2017 are floating rate, we believe our earnings and dividends provide excellent inflation protection in a rising interest rate environment.”\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nFinancial Results and Activities:\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, GAAP net income was $6.2 million or $0.22 per diluted common share and Core Earnings (1) was $7.2 million or $0.25 per diluted common share.

Core Earnings is an adjusted non-GAAP measure that helps the Company evaluate its financial performance excluding the effects of certain transactions and GAAP adjustments that it believes are not necessarily indicative of its current loan origination portfolio and operations. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Core Earnings is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding non-cash equity compensation expense, the incentive fee, depreciation and amortization (to the extent that any of the Company’s target investments are structured as debt and the Company forecloses on any properties underlying such debt), any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income (loss) for the period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income (loss), one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP, and certain non-cash charges after discussions between the Company’s external manager and the Company’s independent directors and after approval by a majority of the Company’s independent directors.\nReconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to Core Earnings is set forth in the table below for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 ($ in thousands):\nFor the three months ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nNet income attributable to common stockholders $ 6,183 $ 30,407 Stock-based compensation 210 581 Incentive fees to affiliate — 381 Early extinguishment of debt costs (1) 768 768 Core Earnings $ 7,161 $ 32,137",
