The certification report will be issued once the management\nreport has been verified and the requisite procedures have been finalized.\nAs announced when the 2017 sales revenue was published, revenue grew significantly - +218% - compared to 2016, higher than the objectives adopted at the time of the Company’s IPO in June 2017. Orders doubled over the year, reaching €17.6 million as at December 31, 2017, providing the group with solid visibility over its 2018 revenue.\nThe continued increase in the gross margin ratio - 33.1% in 2017 - reflects the progressive improvement in the industrial process with the first economies of scale.\nOperating expenses increased but much less than the increase in revenue: R&D expenses rose by 131%, S&M expenses by 30% and G&A expenses by 98%.\nThe operating loss totaled €10.1 million in 2017 after accounting for the IFRS2 charge, compared to €6.62 million in 2016. This loss is attributable to BALYO’s investments over the year. During this period, the Company hired 85 new employees, boosting all of its departments and bringing its total workforce to 158 as at December 31, 2017, compared to 73 at the end of 2016.\nAfter taking into account financial income of -€0.52 million, attributable to exchange losses, the net result is -€10.63 million in 2017, compared to -€6.83 in 2016.\nSignificant events in 2017 and post-closing\nDuring the period, the Company grew its customer portfolio and also benefited from extended agreements with many existing customers. In 2018, this positive trend will continue, in particular in the consumer goods, distribution and automobile sectors in which BALYO’s solutions are experiencing ever-growing success.\nIn 2017, BALYO also recorded significant growth in its installed robots, totaling 223 as at December 31, 2017, and representing a 63% increase compared to the 137 installed robots as at December 31, 2016.\nAlso during this period, the Company moved to new premises in Ivry-sur-Seine. In particular, this site, which is home to the R&D teams, offers new infrastructures for tests and the technological equipment for the trucks. The original Moissy-Cramayel site remains dedicated to the assembly of BALYO’s robotic solutions.\nStrategy and outlook\nThanks to the numerous hires in 2017, BALYO’s deployment capabilities will further increase in 2018. Investments will continue in Research & Development, in particular in the fields of perception and traffic management, a priority to maintain the Company’s edge by offering a standardized technological solution that provides customers with significant ROI. Compared to revenue, the proportion of these investments should decrease, however.\nThe Company confirms its profitability objective of reaching close to break-even in 2018, as well as sales of €200 million in 2022.\nThe annual financial report is available on the Company's website under the \"Investors\" heading: https://www.balyo.fr/Societe/Investisseurs .\nNext financial release: sales revenue for Q1 2018 on April 26, 2018, after the market closes.\nABOUT BALYO\nBalyo transforms standard forklift trucks into standalone intelligent robots thanks to its breakthrough proprietary Driven by Balyo™ technology.
