    "text": "CAPE TOWN, March 28 (Reuters) - South Africa’s elite police unit, the Hawks are investigating three criminal cases against crisis-hit Steinhoff International , a senior official at the unit told parliament on Wednesday.\nSteinhoff, which has more than 40 retail brands that include Conforama and Poundland, is in a fight for survival after admitting “accounting irregularities” in December, wiping about 85 percent off its market value and triggering a liquidity crisis.
