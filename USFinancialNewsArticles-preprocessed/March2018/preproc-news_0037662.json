    "text": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) â€” A lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump's reversal of a ban on petroleum drilling in most of the Arctic Ocean and Atlantic underwater canyons can move forward.\nFederal court Judge Sharon Gleason ruled Monday in Anchorage, Alaska, that environmental groups can sue to keep the ban in place.\nFormer President Barack Obama withdrew Arctic waters under provisions of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.\nObama also banned exploration in 5,937 square miles (15,377 square kilometers) of Atlantic Ocean canyon complexes.\nEnvironmental groups say presidents can permanently withdraw areas but the law makes no provision to reopen areas.\nTrump in April ordered an Interior Department review of the ban with the goal of exploration in the offshore areas.\nGleason ruled the plaintiffs have standing in the case and it can move forward.",
