    "text": "24 COMMENTS Lawrence Kudlow, President Donald Trump’s pick for National Economic Council director , is a prominent Republican economic analyst and television commentator with an extensive record of policy views.\nA former budget official in the Reagan administration, Mr. Kudlow, 70, worked as an economist at Bear Stearns before becoming an editor at the conservative National Review in 1994 and later a host on CNBC. He has been a vocal advocate of “supply-side” economics, the idea that cutting business taxes and regulation will lead to greater investment, hiring and economic growth. He supports free trade and a strong dollar, positions at odds with those of his new boss. He also favors tax cuts and low interest rates, putting him in sync with the president.\nHere is a brief summary of his comments on some key issues:\nTRADE\nMr. Kudlow has criticized Mr. Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. In a recent National Review article written with economist Arthur Laffer and policy analyst Stephen Moore, Mr. Kudlow said tariffs were equivalent to a tax on American consumers who will have to pay more for goods that use steel and aluminum.\n“We are imposing sanctions on our own country, putting up tariffs supposedly to make Americans more prosperous,” the trio wrote. “If ever there were a crisis of logic, this is it.”\nMr. Kudlow has privately said, however, he could support tariffs with some modifications if they are used as a negotiating tool to achieve better trade relationships, according to a person who has spoken with him in recent days.\nUnlike the president, Mr. Kudlow isn’t overly concerned about the U.S. trade deficit. The widening gap “is actually a symptom of Trump’s pro-growth tax and deregulation policies that are working,” he said in another op-ed written with Messrs. Laffer and Moore .\nDOLLAR\nMr. Kudlow says a strong U.S. currency keeps a lid on inflation and interest rates and gives American firms and households more purchasing power, all of which fuels faster economic growth.\nRead more\nKudlow Accepts Post as White House Economic Adviser Commentary by Larry Kudlow and Stephen Moore: Who’s Afraid of Higher Wages? Gary Cohn Resigns as White House Economic Adviser After Losing Tariffs Fight “A return to ‘King Dollar’ will bring a lot more jobs, wage increases and investment flows back into the United States,” wrote Mr. Kudlow, Mr. Moore and Mr. Laffer.\nMr. Trump has expressed support for a weaker dollar as a way to help American exporters by making their products cheaper in global markets.\nTAXES\nMr. Kudlow has said the tax cuts enacted last year would boost annual economic growth to 3% or 4% because they make it cheaper for firms to borrow and increase returns on investment. Those higher growth rates will lead to increased government revenue , more than offsetting the amount forgone because of lower tax rates, he said.\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation has found more modest growth effects and estimated the tax cuts would cost roughly $1 trillion after taking additional economic growth into account.\nINTEREST RATES\nIn 2015, he supported then-Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen’s policy of taking a cautious and slow approach to raising rates from near zero. At the time, many Republicans on Capitol Hill were calling for higher borrowing costs, saying low rates could trigger excessive inflation.\n“Republicans attacking Yellen and calling for higher interest rates should be careful what they wish for,” he wrote in 2015 . “A strong dollar and low energy costs have put the economy in a good place.”\nThe Fed’s new chairman, Jerome Powell, has said he plans to stick to the path of gradual rate increases for now. But officials would want to pick up the pace if needed to keep inflation under control and prevent dangerous asset bubbles from forming.\nMr. Kudlow says the Trump tax cuts, by increasing investment, will allow the economy to grow faster without putting upward pressure on inflation. For that reason, he dismisses concerns that the economy risks overheating.\n“Worries about growth-driven inflation have often been misplaced, as when they last surfaced in the 1980s,” Mr. Kudlow and Mr. Moore wrote in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on March 12 .\nFORECASTING\nMr. Kudlow’s belief in the benefits of tax cuts has fueled optimism, on occasion ahead of a storm. He said in late 2007 that the Bush administration’s tax cuts would guarantee a continued economic expansion, despite wobbly stock markets and worries about a housing slump.\n“There’s no recession coming,” he wrote in December 2007 . “The Bush boom is alive and well. It’s finishing up its sixth consecutive year with more to come. Yes, it’s still the greatest story never told.”\nThat month, the economy entered the worst recession since the Great Depression.\nWrite to David Harrison at david.harrison@wsj.com",
