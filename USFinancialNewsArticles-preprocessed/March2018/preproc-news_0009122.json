    "text": "Company rebranding as Vita-Stat LLC as future outlook and products evolve\nLOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The leading innovator in medication and care management software solutions, Creative Strategies, announced it has changed its name to Vita-Stat LLC in a rebranding effort that better aligns with the company’s evolving strategy and product offerings. The Louisville, Kentucky based company has been providing essential point-of-care solutions to error proof the shared process between caregivers and pharmacists in the senior care, assisted living, and corrections markets for more than a decade.\nVita-Stat’s solutions have been widely adopted by some of the most well-respected assisted living, memory care, and skilled nursing communities and correctional facilities across the country to ensure the highest levels of clinical excellence for their residents. Long-term care (LTC) pharmacies throughout the U.S. prefer Vita-Stat’s solutions for their unique capacity to keep caregivers and pharmacists on the same page from physician order through care delivery.\n“Vita-Stat, your health guardian, is a natural evolution of our company’s growth and success,” said Jerry Merritt, CEO of Vita-Stat LLC. “This name reflects the passion and commitment with which we aspire to provide clinical excellence to all our clients and their residents.\nThe rebranding will be reflected throughout the company’s marketing mediums including:\nCompany’s website. Marketing materials used for sales and trade shows. New company logo. Product packaging.\nVita-Stat has developed two of the industry’s most trusted software products: ACCUflo and statDISPENSE.\nACCUflo is an intuitive, electronic medication administration record (eMAR) system designed for use among long-term care pharmacies and assisted living, memory care and skilled nursing communities. The system tracks every step in the medication administration process, simplifying caregivers’ duties and workflow by allowing them easy and safe access to residents’ medical records, medication, treatments and care tasks.\nstatDISPENSE is smart padlock technology that turns traditional emergency medicine kits, or “tackle box” exchange systems, into a fully automated dispensing and tracking device that integrates medical record keeping and inventory management into an affordable, simple-to-use solution.\n“Vita-Stat has proven there’s a better way to manage point-of-care delivery of medications and care tasks to optimize caregiver and pharmacist workflow; lowering costs while also ensuring the highest levels of resident care,” said John Humphreys, Senior Vice President of Vita-Stat LLC. “We have outstanding employees and a strong management team which leads to my confidence that we are poised to increase our presence in the senior markets.”\n“Although our name is changing, our mission is not,” said John Carroll, founder of Vita-Stat LLC. “We remain committed to helping healthcare organizations serve their communities by providing them with the most effective, streamlined solutions for safe medication and care administration.”\nAbout Vita-Stat LLC\nBased in Louisville, Kentucky, Vita-Stat LLC is a leading innovator of medication and care management software solutions to optimize and error proof the shared process between caregivers, pharmacists and residents in the senior care, assisted living and corrections markets.
