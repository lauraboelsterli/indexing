    "text": "President Donald Trump is scheduled to discuss video game violence Thursday at a White House school safety meeting with industry leaders and their critics, as well as a handful of Republican lawmakers.\nOne of the companies that is slated to be represented at the meeting counts Trump's younger brother as a board member.\nThe meeting, scheduled for 2 p.m. ET, comes in the wake of the February massacre of 17 students and adults at a South Florida high school.\nDays after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Trump suggested that some violent video games may be partly to blame for such tragedies. \"I'm hearing more and more people say the level of violence on video games is really shaping young people's thoughts,\" he said at the time.\nshow chapters Trump: Shooting was an act of pure evil      10:56 AM ET Mon, 2 Oct 2017 | 01:30 Trump has suggested a ratings system for video games. The president of the Entertainment Software Rating Board, which assigns ratings to video games, is listed as one of the meeting's participants.\nTrump will lead a conversation about \"violent video game exposure and the correlation to aggression and desensitization in children,\" a White House spokeswoman told CNBC.\nThe gaming industry's representatives will include CEO Strauss Zelnick of Take-Two Interactive , publisher of the popular and notoriously violent \"Grand Theft Auto\" franchise.\nThe meeting also appears to include a contingent of critics concerned about the impact of video game violence on young minds, such as retired Army Lt. Col. Dave Grossman, author of \"Assassination Generation: Video Games, Aggression, and the Psychology of Killing.\"\nThe CEO of ZeniMax Media is also scheduled to attend. ZeniMax, parent company of the developer of the \"Fallout\" and \"Elder Scrolls\" franchises, has Trump's younger brother, Robert S. Trump, among its board of directors . \nHere's the full list of participants: \nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Mo. Rep. Martha Roby, R-Ala.
