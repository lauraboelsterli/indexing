    "text": "SAINT-MICHEL-DES-SAINTS, Quebec, March 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nouveau Monde Graphite Inc. (TSX-V:NOU) (“ NMG ”) is pleased to announce the nomination of Patrice Boulanger to its Board of Directors. Mr. Boulanger has nearly 20 years experience in the graphite business after having held various management position at SGL Group, one of the world's leading manufacturers of carbon-based products headquartered in Germany. During his career at SGL Group, Mr. Boulanger worked in production, R&D and within the commercial group, he has been responsible for sales activities of a product segment. Previously, he also led the global customer service group of SGL Group. Following a merger with Showa Denko, Mr. Boulanger currently acts as Global Manager Strategic Projects and Canadian Legal Entity Managing Director of Showa Denko Carbon Canada Inc. Patrice Boulanger completed his Bachelor of Electrical Engineering degree in 1997 at Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières and he is currently completing his EMBA at Concordia University.\n\" I am delighted to welcome Mr. Boulanger to the Board of Directors. His unique experience in graphite marketing and product R&D will greatly benefit our company as we complete the construction of our demonstration plant and begin sending customers graphite products,\" commented Eric Desaulniers President & CEO of NMG.\nNMG also announces that Mr. Michel Delsaer submitted his resignation as director of NMG. NMG’s Board of Directors extends a warm thank you to Mr. Delsaer for his contribution to the Board of Directors during his tenure.\nAbout Nouveau Monde Graphite\nGeologist and mining exploration expert Éric Desaulniers founded Nouveau Monde Graphite (NMG) in 2012. In 2015, thanks to the innovative use of 3D geodesic modelling technology, NMG discovered two major and high-quality graphite deposits on its Matawinie property, located in Saint-Michel-des-Saints, 150 km north of Montreal, Quebec. NMG then stepped out of its exploration phase to enter an era of development, having secured financial support with prominent venture capitalists and bankers.\nOn October 25, 2017, NMG revealed the results of its pre-feasibility study, independently conducted in accordance to the “Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum”. The study proved the high graphite content and quality and showed the industrial exploitation potential of the deposit located in the West Zone of its property. Having secured $13.7 M, during the Summer of 2018, NMG plans on operating a demonstration facility with a capacity to hold up to 1,000 tonnes of graphite concentrate flakes a year. The two-year project’s goal is to produce and characterize various forms of graphite to meet the needs expressed by potential industrial clients. All the while, NMG will finalize investments and start working on the development of an open-pit mine and the creation of a treatment facility capable of producing 52,000 tonnes of concentrate a year. Both the mining operation and the plant will be fully electric.\nFinally, in a vertical integration and sustainable development perspective, NMG has begun planning the establishment of a large-scale graphite secondary transformation facility. This will cater to the ever-growing popularity and use of lithium-ion batteries and would be the only existing manufacture of its kind in North America.\nOur team at NMG has more than 40 years of recent experience with graphite. NMG develops its projects in the utmost respect of the neighbouring communities while favouring a minimal ecological footprint. NMG has many direct accesses to labour and needed infrastructure for its operations, such as an abundant source of affordable and renewable hydroelectricity.\nSubscribe to our newsfeed:\nhttp://nouveaumonde.us12.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=f5e3304c32bfb54992fd9acce&id=603de466df\nFor more information:\nMarie-Eve Chaume\nChief communications officer\n+1 (514) 951-5498\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nAll statements, other than statements of historical fact, contained in this press release including, but not limited to (i) generally, or the “About Nouveau Monde Graphite” paragraphs which essentially describe the Corporation’s outlook and objectives, constitute ''forward-looking information'' or ''forward-looking statements'' within the meaning of certain securities laws, and are based on expectations, estimates and projections as of the time of this press release.
