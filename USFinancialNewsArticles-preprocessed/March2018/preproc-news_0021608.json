(Nasdaq:URGN) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing advanced non-surgical treatments to address unmet needs in the field of urology, with a focus on uro-oncology. The Company has developed RTGel™, a proprietary sustained release, hydrogel-based formulation for potentially improving therapeutic profiles of existing drugs. UroGen Pharma's sustained release technology is designed to enable longer exposure of the urinary tract tissue to medications, making local therapy a potentially more effective treatment option.

UroGen Pharma is headquartered in Ra’anana, Israel and maintains a corporate office in New York City.\nUROGEN CONTACTS:\nChristine Cassiano\nCorporate Affairs Officer\nChristineC@urogen.com\n714-552-0326\nOr\nKate Bechtold\nDirector, Corporate Communications & Investor Relations\nKateB@UroGen.com\n914-552-0456\nSource:UroGen Pharma Ltd.",
