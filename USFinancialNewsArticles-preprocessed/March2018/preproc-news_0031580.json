    "text": "Home / Technology / Broadcom (AVGO) stock ends a roller coaster week up Broadcom (AVGO) stock ends a roller coaster week up 32 mins ago \nShares of Broadcom suffered the stock’s biggest loss in 9 months on Friday, shedding nearly 5 percent. \nBut the stock still ended a roller coaster week up — gaining less than half a percent over the five days of trading — bolstered by weekend acquisition rumors. \nBroadcom ended last week with its hopes still alive for its hostile takeover of mobile chip giant Qualcomm, despite an unusual review by the U.S. Treasury’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. On Friday night, the Wall Street Journal reported that Intel might make a run at Broadcom to battle the Qualcomm deal. \nBroadcom opened the week up 3 percent on that report, and spiked as much as 4 percent Tuesday. ( Intel CEO Brian Krzanich later bucked takeover rumors in an interview with CNBC’s Jim Cramer.) \nThen, on Tuesday, President Donald Trump ordered the immediate and permanent end of merger talks . On Wednesday, Broadcom called off its bid, and the stock shed as much as 2 percent Wednesday following the announcement. \nOn Thursday evening, Broadcom announced first quarter earnings that beat estimates, but shares opened nearly 2 percent down Friday, and finished the day down almost 5 percent. \nThe stock is up nearly 15 percent in the last 12 months.
