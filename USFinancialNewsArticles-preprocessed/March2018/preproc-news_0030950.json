    "text": "2 COMMENTS Toys “R” Us Inc. said early Thursday it filed a motion seeking bankruptcy court approval to start a wind-down of its U.S. business and liquidation of inventory in all its 735 U.S. stores, including those in Puerto Rico.\n“Toys “R” Us will provide more details about the plans for the liquidation of its U.S. stores and going out of business sales in the near term,” the Wayne, N.J.-based company said in a news release.\nThe company also said it is pursuing a going-concern reorganization and a sale process for its Canadian and international operations in Asia and Central Europe, including Germany, Austria and Switzerland.\nInternational operations in Australia, France, Poland, Portugal and Spain are considering their options in light of this announcement, the company said, including potential sale processes in their respective markets.\nThe company’s stores in all these international markets are currently open.\nThe motion that the company filed with the bankruptcy court included bidding procedures for the Canadian operations. Toys “R” Us also said it is in talks “with certain interested parties” for a deal that could combine up to 200 of the top performing U.S. stores with its Canadian operations.\nRelated Video The retail industry is undergoing another major shift -- to e-commerce. How did we get here? Photo: Associated Press While talks continue on this transaction, the company said, Toys “R” Us is seeking court approval to implement the liquidation of inventory in all U.S. stores, subject to a right to recall any stores included in the proposed Canadian transaction.\nA previously announced administration of the U.K. business continues.\n“I am very disappointed with the result, but we no longer have the financial support to continue the company’s U.S. operations,” said Dave Brandon, the company’s chairman and chief executive.\nKirkland & Ellis LLP is the company’s principal legal counsel, Alvarez & Marsal is serving as restructuring adviser and Lazard Ltd. is serving as financial adviser.",
