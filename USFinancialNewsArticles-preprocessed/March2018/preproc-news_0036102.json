    "text": "RESTON, Va., March 21, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- GTL today announced that Deb Alderson has been named as Chief Executive Officer of GTL, joining the company on April 2 nd . Alderson brings a history of past success and leadership to the company, most recently as CEO of Sotera Defense Solutions, which was acquired by KeyW Corporation in March 2017. Deb has spent the majority of her career in government services. In addition to Sotera, she served in leadership roles with SRA International, SAIC, and Anteon. Among other accolades, she earned a \"Fed 100\" award from Federal Computer Week as a leader who affects change, progress, and efficiency in determining how the federal government acquires, develops, and manages information technology.\n\"Deb is the right person to lead GTL and continue the company's technology leadership,\" said Michael Sand, GTL Board Chairman. \"She has a passion for improving the corrections environment through GTL products, and her strong experience leading sales and service organizations will benefit our customers, inmates, and GTL employees. We are confident that Deb will elevate our already-strong leadership team and will be a highly-capable successor to Brian Oliver, the company's retiring CEO. We greatly appreciate Brian's leadership of GTL during a time of tremendous growth and transformation, as well as his assistance in executing a smooth transition of leadership. We look forward to continuing to work with him in his new capacity as an advisor to the company.\"\nAlderson brings a proven history of integrating acquired companies to drive business success to GTL, following a period when the company has executed a number of strategic moves to bolster its technology leadership position in the corrections industry. GTL acquired San Francisco-based Telmate in August 2017, which strengthened the company's position as a provider of wireless tablets to the corrections market. GTL also acquired Nashville-based IDS in January 2017, which added education professionals and content to help prepare inmates for re-entry and reduce recidivism.\n\"I am excited to be joining GTL and leading the company during a period of tremendous opportunity,\" said Alderson. \"GTL's products play a critical role in facilitating inmates' connection to friends and family. I am excited about the opportunity for GTL products to continue to enhance communication, increase facility safety, and provide education opportunities to inmates. We will work to deliver these benefits to our corrections customers, while also improving the rehabilitation and re-entry of those who are incarcerated.\"\nAbout GTL\nGTL leads the fields of correctional technology, education, and government payment services with visionary solutions and customized products that integrate seamlessly to deliver security, financial value, and operational efficiencies while aiding inmate rehabilitation and reducing recidivism rates.
