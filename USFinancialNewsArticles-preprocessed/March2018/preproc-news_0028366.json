(NASDAQ: ALOT), a global leader in data visualization technologies, today reported financial results for the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter and year ended January 31, 2018.\n“We concluded a solid year with a strong performance in the fourth quarter, generating record revenue and bookings,” said AstroNova President and CEO Greg Woods. “Product Identification revenue was up 16% for the fourth quarter, as the QuickLabel organic business continues to grow and the new products we introduced last year begin to ramp. We also are making excellent progress with the TrojanLabel product line, as we continue to add dealers and brand awareness. Our newest TrojanLabel products, the T4 and T2C, began shipping at the end of the fourth quarter, and we expect these products to contribute nicely to our results in the coming quarters.\n“Test & Measurement revenue was up 58% from the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter, as we began to see revenue contribution from the Honeywell agreement,” Woods said. “Our fourth-quarter results included costs related to the integration of the acquired product line, and those costs are expected to continue for the next couple of quarters as we migrate the manufacturing of the narrow-format printers to West Warwick. The integration process should be completed by the end of the first half of this fiscal year. During the fourth quarter, we also introduced an upgraded TMX data acquisition system featuring enhanced security with Windows 10 and a high-speed oscilloscope function.\n“The success of our efforts during the past two years to expand international sales is evident, as international revenue was up 72% in the fourth quarter from the same period in fiscal 2017 and up 52% in fiscal 2018 compared with the prior year,” Woods said. “Our $43.6 million of international revenue for fiscal 2018 was another record for the Company. We are now winning larger contracts from global organizations due to our new worldwide presence that would not have been possible a short time ago.”\nRecent Highlights\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share payable March 30, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 22, 2018 David S. Smith was named Vice President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer Dick Warzala, Chairman and CEO of Allied Motion Technologies, was appointed to the Board of Directors\nFinancial Summary\nRevenue in the fourth quarter totaled $32.7 million, an increase of 27% from $25.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, reflecting higher sales in both of the Company's segments – Product Identification and Test & Measurement. For the full year, revenue increased 15.2% to a record $113.4 million from $98.4 million in fiscal 2017.\nGross profit for the fourth quarter was $12.6 million, or 38.7% of revenue, compared with $10.1 million, or 39.3% of revenue, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in gross profit dollars reflected higher revenue in the 2018 period, while the decrease in gross margin percentage was due to expenses associated with the Company's asset purchase and licensing agreement with Honeywell International's Aerospace division in September 2017.\nFiscal 2018 gross profit was $44.0 million, or 38.8% of revenue, compared with $39.5 million, or 40.1% of revenue, in fiscal 2017. Lower gross margin percentage in fiscal 2018 reflected the Honeywell transaction as well as expenses associated with the Company's February 2017 acquisition of Trojanlabel ApS.\nOperating expenses for the fourth quarter were $10.5 million compared with $8.9 million in the same period of fiscal 2017. The increase was due primarily to higher selling and marketing and R&D expenses associated with the introduction of new products in Product Identification and Test & Measurement. Fiscal 2018 operating expenses increased to $38.6 million from $33.2 million a year earlier.\nOperating income for the fourth quarter was $2.1 million, or 6.5% of revenue, compared with $1.2 million, or 4.5% of revenue, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, reflecting higher revenue in the 2018 period. Operating income for fiscal 2018 was $5.4 million, or 4.8% of revenue, compared with $6.3 million, or 6.4% of revenue, in fiscal 2017, primarily reflecting the effect of integration expenses in the 2018 period.\nGAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $628,000, or $0.09 per diluted share, down from $766,000, or $0.10 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. GAAP net income for fiscal 2018 was $3.3 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, compared with $4.2 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, in fiscal 2017. Results for both the fourth-quarter and full-year periods of 2018 were negatively impacted by $1.1 million, or $0.16 per share, in taxes due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Of this total, $1.0 million was related to revaluation of deferred tax assets at the new lower corporate tax rate and $104,000 was related to the Transition Tax on un-repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding this impact, net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 was $1.7 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, while net income for full-year fiscal 2018 was $4.4 million, or $0.63 per diluted share.\nFourth-quarter 2018 bookings increased 32% to $34.8 million from $26.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, with increases in both the Product Identification and Test & Measurement segments.\nBacklog at January 31, 2018 was $21.4 million, up 22% from $17.6 million the end of the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter.\nBusiness Outlook\n“As we begin fiscal 2019, we are optimistic about the year ahead and the long-term future of AstroNova,” continued Woods. “We are capitalizing on many product and business development initiatives, and we continue to see excellent growth opportunities from our TrojanLabel acquisition and our asset purchase and licensing agreement with Honeywell International's Aerospace division. In addition, as we seek to leverage our top-line growth into enhanced profitability, we see many ongoing operational excellence opportunities from the Honeywell and TrojanLabel integrations as well as through continued process improvements and automation that will enable us to further drive economies of scale.”\nFourth-Quarter Fiscal 2018 Conference Call\nAstroNova will conduct an investor conference call at 9:00 a.m. ET today.
