German Chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) Angela Merkel addresses a joint news conference of coalition partners before signing a coalition deal in Berlin, Germany, March 12, 2018. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt “At the appropriate time, we will talk about the candidates for these personnel questions. Of course, for all the positions to be filled in the next year ... we will have good candidates, but I don’t want to speculate today,” Merkel said. “Whether there is a German, or a non-German, at the helm of a European institution, the reputation of this institution must as good as possible,” she told a news conference in Berlin.
