    "text": "SEATTLE, March 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Wild Gravity, a new-breed marketing startup, offering on-demand agency and production services, announced today its acquisition of award-winning video production company Workhouse Creative.\nFounded by Microsoft marketing and advertising veterans Jon Sneider and Jonathan Harris, Wild Gravity hacks the traditional agency/production model to deliver world-class marketing on-demand, providing clients with a full-stack marketing solution. The new company is leading a national industry trend as brands move away from large agencies and over-staffed productions toward a more cost-effective, responsive approach.\n\"Wild Gravity is creating a new market category—we're not an ad agency and we're more than a production shop,\" said Sneider, \"We're a marketing production company, our focus is on quality and responsiveness and we deliver anything from one-off broadcast assets to multi-channel ad campaigns, at speed.\"\n\"With the addition of Workhouse Creative we have the space and we have the talent to provide major brands with premium video and world class digital content, with newsroom-level responsiveness,\" added Harris.\nWild Gravity is already doing business with the biggest tech companies in Seattle, and their client roster also includes a number of local startups and national brands.\n\"We're marketing, creative, and production vets from the world's foremost brands, top agencies, and leading-edge production shops who all know how to dodge the typical agency pain points and just get stuff done,\" said Sneider, who led advertising for L.L. Bean, Microsoft Windows and Redfin prior to launching Wild Gravity.\n\"Workhouse Creative won 9 Addy awards, just last year. We recently executed a large scale high-end video project with the Workhouse team, so we already know this partnership makes sense. This completes our pivot to become a marketing production company with strategy, creative, and production all under the same roof,\" added Sneider.\n\"Wild Gravity's agency-on-demand model plus Workhouse Creative's production chops opens up a world of storytelling opportunities for brands. Others have approached us over the years, but nothing felt right to us,\" said Keith Rivers, Principal and Director, Workhouse Creative, Inc. \"We're really fired up for this—Wild Gravity understands and echoes our brand and culture and we're so excited to join forces.\"\n\"The acquisition of Workhouse Creative empowers us to take the next step for our business. With the addition of these talented people and amazing facilities we're able to deliver work of the utmost quality while remaining lean and agile,\" said Jonathan Harris, Executive Creative Director/Founder, Wild Gravity, LLC.\nTerms of the deal were not disclosed.\nAbout Wild Gravity\nWild Gravity is a team of executive-level marketing, digital, creative, and production pros from some of the world's foremost brands, agencies, and production shops. We're hacking the marketing production model to deliver world-class, strategic work that gets out the door faster and for less.
