REUTERS/Leah Millis The DIHK trade group, BDA employers association, BDI industry group and German Confederation of Skilled Crafts (ZDH) also raised concerns about German domestic policy issues in a joint statement issued after a meeting in Munich.\n“German industry is extremely concerned about the decision of the U.S. government to imposed far-reaching punitive tariffs,” the groups said in a joint statement. “To prevent a spiral of protectionism, Germany and the European Union must continue to stand up the global world trade system.”\nReporting by Gernot Heller; Writing by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Joseph Nasr\n ",
