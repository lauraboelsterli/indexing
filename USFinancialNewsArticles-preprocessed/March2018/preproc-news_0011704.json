Hoogland, who helped the Dutch win the men’s team sprint, won his individual event in 59.459 seconds, 0.286 faster than Australia’s Matthew Glaetzer with his fellow Dutchman Theo Bos taking the bronze medal. Wild, who won gold in the women’s omnium and scratch, scored 49 points in the 25km race, six more than Jennifer Valente of the United States with third-placed Canadian Jasmin Duehring notching 30.

Australians Cameron Meyer and Callum Scotson claimed bronze. Degrendele was 0.086 seconds faster than Lee Wai Sze of Hong Kong in the keirin final in which Lithuanian Simona Krupeckaite was third. The Netherlands won twice as many medals as their closest rivals. Germany won four gold and two bronze, Britain two gold, three silver and a bronze and Australia two of each colour. The United States won two gold in their haul of four and Italy one gold and one silver in a total of six medals. Reporting by Rex Gowar, editing by Ed Osmond",
