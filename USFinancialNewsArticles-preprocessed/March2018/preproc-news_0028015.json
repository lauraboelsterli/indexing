AGTEK's products are aimed at streamlining the contractor's workflow for estimating and project management, using an Internet-enabled graphical toolset that is shareable between office and field. They provide the ability to integrate innovative machine control and positioning solutions with intuitive software that enables fast and accurate quantity takeoffs, 3D models, production plans, and machine tracking analysis. This provides construction companies with a unified approach for optimising plans, controlling grade, and monitoring performance to maximise productivity.\n\"This acquisition gives construction contractors comprehensive field to enterprise solutions for construction management. AGTEK's track record for developing ground-breaking, easy-to-use products make them an important addition to Hexagon's Heavy Construction technologies portfolio,\" said Hexagon President and CEO Ola Rollén . \"As we move towards a more connected world, civil construction projects will become increasingly digital, with a focus on intelligent workflows, asset management, and collaboration.
