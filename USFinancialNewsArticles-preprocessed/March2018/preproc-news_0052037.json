    "text": "TOKYO, March 30 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks rose on Friday morning as technology firms such as Tokyo Electron and Advantest jumped in sympathy with a rebound in their U.S. counterparts, which were battered this week on concerns over possible government regulation.\nThe Nikkei rose 1.0 percent to 21,364.75 in midmorning trade. For the week, the index has gained 3.6 percent so far, though down 3.2 percent for the month and has tumbled 6.1 percent on a quarterly basis.\nVolume is expected to be thin on Friday, as markets were shut for the long Easter weekend break in many of the worldâ€™s largest trading centers.\nRecently-battered semiconductor equipment makers rebounded, with Tokyo Electron up 3.3 percent and Advantest Corp 1.8 percent higher.\nSilicon maker Sumco gained 2.3 percent.\nOn the other hand, Japan Display Inc dropped more than 4 percent after the company said its board will discuss on Friday a plan to raise 50 billion yen ($470 million), including more than 30 billion yen through a third-party allotment of new shares.\nThe broader Topix gained 0.5 percent to 1,711.66.
