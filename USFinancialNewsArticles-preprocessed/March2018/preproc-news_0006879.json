    "text": "MOSCOW, March 2 (Reuters) - Taneko refinery, controlled by Russian mid-sized oil producer Tatneft, will export diesel through the Sever pipeline this year for the first time, sending 300,000 tonnes on the route to the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk.\nTaneko now exports diesel by train, and gaining access to the pipeline could boost its shipments of oil products for export. It is expected to produce 1 million tonnes of gasoline this year and aims to double diesel output to 3 million tonnes this year.\nThe source, familiar with the companies’ plans, also said TAIF, another refinery which like Taneko is located in Russia’s Tatarstan region, will supply about 1.5 million tonnes of diesel to the Sever pipeline, a similar volume to this year.\nBoth Tatneft and TAIF did not immediately comment on the plans.\nRussia plans to increase diesel exports from Primorsk to 19.8 million tonnes in 2019 and 23.9 million tonnes in 2020 from an expected 18.3 million tonnes in 2018.\nTatneft plans to invest about 200 billion roubles ($3.5 billion) in upgrading Taneko in 2017-2025 and is considering plans to build a third production line at the refinery.\n$1 = 57.0525 roubles Reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin Editing by Katya Golubkova and Peter Graff\n ",
