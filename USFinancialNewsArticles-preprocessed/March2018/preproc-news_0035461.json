Strengthening our presence in Ireland through this acquisition will also enable us to extend our client offerings. We are delighted to welcome Andrew Ryan and his team to the Vistra family.\"\nAndrew Ryan, Managing Director of Canyon, added: \"In a relatively short period of time, our presence in the market has grown tremendously and we have built a reputation as a strong player in the aircraft leasing market.
