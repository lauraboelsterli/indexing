    "text": "NEW YORK, March 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aspen Group, Inc. (Nasdaq:ASPU), a post-secondary education company, today announced financial results for its 2018 third quarter ended January 31, 2018, highlighted by revenue of $5.7 million, and active student body growth at Aspen University (AU) of 49% year-over-year and 110% active student body growth at United States University (USU) since May, 2017 (9-month period). Both Aspen University and United States University ended the quarter with nursing students representing 73% of their active student body.\nMichael Mathews, Chairman & CEO of Aspen Group, commented, “We’re pleased to report that already 46% of USU’s total active students have selected to pay for their education through a monthly payment method. This immediate uptake, particularly from Nurse Practitioner students at USU, gives us great confidence that USU will follow in AU’s footsteps with the overwhelming majority of students paying month-to-month.”\nFiscal Q3 2018 Financial Highlights:*\nRevenue totaled $5,701,958, an increase of 53% as compared to the prior fiscal year; GAAP Gross Profit totaled $2,900,633, a 29% increase as compared to the prior fiscal year; Net Loss applicable to shareholders of ($2,147,945), as compared to Net Income of $7,377 in the prior fiscal year; Diluted Net Loss per share was $(0.15), as compared to $0.00 in the prior fiscal year; EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, totaled $(1,588,565); Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, totaled $(597,305);\nFiscal 2018 Third Quarter Financial and Operational Highlights:*\nAspen University United States University Q3 FY’2018 Q3 FY’2018 New Student Enrollments 1,164 103* Active Student Body 6,066 446 -College of Nursing Students 4,401 326 Monthly Payment Method Students 4,194 204 For the third quarter, revenues increased 53% to $5,701,958 as compared to $3,735,626 for the same period the prior year. GAAP Gross Profit increased to $2,900,633 or 51% Gross Margin. Net loss applicable to shareholders was ($2,147,945) or Diluted Net Loss per share of $(0.15). EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $(1,588,565) or (28%). Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $(597,305) or (10%).\nOne-time expenses related to the acquisition of United States University totaled $610,219, which represented an increase in the company’s EPS loss by an additional $(0.04).\nAspen University increased its internet advertising spend rate sequentially by approximately $167,000 or 17%, primarily the result of a spending increase at the Doctoral level during the month of January. Additionally, the company launched a 9-person outside sales force in January, initially targeting the San Diego, Los Angeles, Phoenix and NY Metropolitan areas. These two sales & marketing investment initiatives are designed to drive incremental enrollment growth in the upcoming 2019 fiscal year, consequently the company’s gross margin and marketing efficiency ratios are expected to moderately decline short-term as a result.\n*All comparatives include USU financial results for the two month period from December 1, 2017 – January 31, 2018.\nExcluding the $610,219 one-time USU acquisition expenses, G&A increased sequentially by $900,750. The acquisition of United States University accounted for over three-quarters of the G&A increase, as the company’s non-faculty full-time staff rose from 110 to 142 employees. The majority of the remaining increase was a one-time expense of legal fees related to the HEMG NJ bankruptcy proceeding in which the company is a creditor. On a year-over-year basis, G&A rose by 119%, from $2,133,074 to $4,677,359.\nThe following table presents gross profit calculated in accordance with GAAP:\nFor the Quarters Ended January 31, 2018* 2017 Revenues $ 5,701,958 $ 3,735,626 Costs of revenues (exclusive of amortization shown separately) 2,665,664 1,359,131 Amortization expenses excluded from cost of revenues 135,661 119,577 GAAP gross profit $ 2,900,633 $ 2,256,918\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to Net loss, a GAAP financial measure:\nFor the Quarters Ended January 31, 2018* 2017 Net income (loss) $ (2,147,945 ) $ 7,377 Interest expense, net of interest income 211,486 78,317 Depreciation & amortization 347,894 132,727 EBITDA (loss) (1,588,565 ) 218,421 Bad debt expense 132,644 (25,680 ) USU Acquisition expenses 610,219 — Non-recurring charges 85,853 146,809 Stock-based compensation 162,544 96,498 Adjusted EBITDA (Loss) $ (597,305 ) $ 436,048\nFiscal Year 2018 Fourth Quarter Business Update:\nThe company expects to have approximately 70 enrollment advisors employed by early-April, approximately one month ahead of its original fiscal year-end target date. Consequently, the company intends to increase its internet marketing monthly spend rate to over $600,000 beginning with the month of April.\nRevenues for fiscal year 2018 fourth quarter are expected to increase by at least $1 million sequentially, or over $6.7 million.\nNon-GAAP – Financial Measures:\nThis press release includes both financial measures in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP, as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance, financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplemental to, and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income, and cash flow from operating activities, liquidity or any other financial measures. They may not be indicative of the historical operating results of Aspen Group nor are they intended to be predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nOur management uses and relies on Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA, each of which are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that both management and shareholders benefit from referring to the following non-GAAP financial measures in planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparison. Our management recognizes that the non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations because of the excluded items described above.\nAspen Group defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings (or loss) from continuing operations before the items in the table above. Aspen Group excludes these expenses because they are non-cash or non-recurring in nature.\nWe have included a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We believe that providing the non-GAAP financial measures, together with the reconciliation to GAAP, helps investors make comparisons between Aspen Group and other companies. In making any comparisons to other companies, investors need to be aware that companies use different non-GAAP measures to evaluate their financial performance. Investors should pay close attention to the specific definition being used and to the reconciliation between such measure and the corresponding GAAP measure provided by each company under applicable SEC rules.\nConference Call:\nAspen Group, Inc. will host a conference call to discuss its fiscal year 2018 third quarter (ending January 31, 2018) financial results and business outlook on Thursday, March 15, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. (ET).
