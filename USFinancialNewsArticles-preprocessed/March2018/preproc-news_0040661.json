    "text": "TROY, Mich., March 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Altair Engineering Inc. (NASDAQ:ALTR) today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full 2017.\n“Altair delivered strong fourth quarter and full year results highlighted by revenue that exceeded guidance,” said James Scapa, Founder, Chairman and CEO. “We are also seeing a positive margin impact as a growing portion of revenue comes from higher margin software.”\n“We enter 2018 with the strongest product portfolio we’ve ever had, including our recent acquisition of Runtime. With ongoing investments in R&D, we continue to innovate to increase the value our simulation-driven design, high performance computing, IoT and Analytics solutions can deliver to our customers. Our strong billings growth in Q4, and 2017 as a whole, support our optimism for further growth in 2018, which coupled with continued investments, will help further elevate our leadership position in the multi-billion dollar markets we serve.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nSoftware product revenue was $67.9 million, an increase of 11% from $61.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Total revenue was $89.9 million, an increase of 8% compared to $82.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss was $(60.3) million, compared to net income of $5.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter of 2017 included the impact of $8.0 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses as well as $56.6 million in tax expenses, substantially due to the recording of a valuation allowance on the U.S. deferred tax assets from the exercise and expected exercise of a significant number of non-qualified stock options, and to a lesser degree as a result of recent tax reform. Diluted net loss per share was $(1.03), based on 58.7 million diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, compared to diluted net income per share of $0.10 for the fourth quarter of 2016, based on 58.8 million diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. Adjusted EBITDA was $8.4 million, compared to $10.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA represents net (loss) income adjusted for income tax expense, interest expense, interest income and other, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges, asset impairment charges and other special items as determined by management. Non-GAAP net income was $12.6 million, compared to $6.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP net income per share was $0.18, based on 68.2 million diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, compared to $0.12 for the fourth quarter of 2016, based on 58.8 million diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. Non-GAAP net income excludes stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions and certain tax adjustments. Cash flow from operations was an outflow of $(1.4) million, compared to an inflow of $23 thousand for the fourth quarter of 2016. Free cash flow, which consists of cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, was $(4.5) million compared to $(4.7) million for the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nSoftware product revenue was $244.8 million, an increase of 9% from $223.8 million for 2016. Total revenue was $333.3 million, an increase of 6% compared to $313.2 million for 2016. Net loss was $(99.4) million, compared to net income of $10.2 million for 2016. 2017 included the impact of $47.3 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses as well as $63.0 million in tax expenses, substantially due to the recording of a valuation allowance on the U.S. deferred tax assets from the exercise and expected exercise of a significant number of non-qualified stock options, and to a lesser degree, as a result of recent tax reform. Diluted net loss per share was $(1.89), based on 52.5 million diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, compared to diluted net income per share of $0.18 for 2016, based on 57.9 million diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. Adjusted EBITDA was $22.5 million, compared to $30.8 million for 2016. Non-GAAP net income was $16.1 million, compared to $18.6 million for 2016. Non-GAAP net income per share was $0.26, based on 62.6 million diluted weighted average common shares outstanding, compared to $0.32 for 2016, based on 57.9 million diluted weighted average common shares outstanding. Cash flow from operations was $16.1 million, compared to $21.4 million for 2016. Free cash flow was $8.6 million compared to $11.9 million for 2016.\nBusiness Outlook\nBased on information available as of today, Altair is issuing on guidance for the first quarter and full year 2018 as indicated below.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Full Year 2018 Software Product Revenue $ 64.5 to $ 65.0 $ 269.0 to $ 273.0 Total Revenue $ 86.5 $ 87.5 $ 362.0 $ 366.0 GAAP Net Income $ 0.0 $ 0.5 $ 10.0 $ 12.0 Adjusted EBITDA $ 3.8 $ 4.3 $ 32.0 $ 34.0 Non-GAAP Net Income $ 1.8 $ 2.3 $ 18.0 $ 20.0 (All figures in millions)\nConference Call Information What: Altair Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results Conference Call When: Wednesday, March 21, 2018 Time: 4:30 p.m. ET Live Call: (866) 754-5204, domestic (636) 812-6621, international Replay: (855) 859-2056, passcode 4684517, domestic (404) 537-3406, passcode 4684517, international Webcast: http://investor.altair.com (live & replay) Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Non-GAAP Net Income and Free Cash Flow.\nAltair believes that these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations. The Company’s management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare the Company’s performance to that of prior periods for trend analysis, for purposes of determining executive and senior management incentive compensation and for budgeting and planning purposes. The Company also believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company’s financial measures with other software companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors.\nManagement of the Company does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company’s financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Altair urges investors to review the reconciliation of its non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly financial results, including this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company’s business.\nReconciliation tables of the most comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are included with the financial tables at the end of this release.\nAbout Altair\nAltair is focused on the development and broad application of simulation technology to synthesize and optimize designs, processes and decisions for improved business performance. With more than 2,000 employees, Altair is headquartered in Troy, Michigan, USA and operates 69 offices throughout 24 countries.
