    "text": "63 COMMENTS The NCAA men’s basketball tournament has begun, and this year it operates in the shadow of an FBI investigation. Taxpayers can only wish that the bureau had pursued the mishandling of classified information by a secretary of State as aggressively as agents seem to have pursued Michigan State. \nAccording to a recent report from Yahoo Sports, documents obtained by the feds suggest that a Spartan player’s mother may have accepted lunch and $400 from an agent. Would that even cover the installation and maintenance of a private server? As far as this column can tell the Spartans were neither extremely careless nor grossly negligent with information about U.S. military operations overseas. Michigan State Coach Tom Izzo doesn’t believe they broke any rules. \nHis is just one of many college basketball programs that have captured the attention of the FBI. While the investigation has not led to charges against any major figures in the sport, it’s not for lack of trying. According to the Washington Post: \nOne morning late last August, Miami men’s basketball Coach Jim Larranaga was about to board a flight to North Carolina for a recruiting trip when he got a phone call from his wife. Two FBI agents were at the house, Liz Larranaga told her husband. She then handed the phone to one of the agents, who asked Jim to remain at the airport until they reached him. One month later, at a news conference in New York City, a federal prosecutor and a top FBI official touted the results of an ongoing investigation into the black market surrounding college basketball. A “high-level” Adidas executive had arranged six-figure payments for the families of high school recruits, prosecutors alleged, at the behest of coaches at Miami and Louisville. Assistant coaches at Auburn, Oklahoma State, Arizona and Southern California had all taken money from a financial adviser and an aspiring NBA agent, according to criminal complaints, and agreed to steer college stars their way. Ten teams of FBI agents made arrests in 10 states that week, according to court records and people familiar with the investigation, while an 11th group of agents raided the New Jersey office of prominent NBA agent Andy Miller. Even if everything the government alleges is true, the actions still don’t appear to be crimes. The premise of this enforcement effort is similar to the banks-defrauded-themselves argument that the Obama administration used in its efforts to extract politically popular settlements from large financial firms. The Post reports:\nThe charges at the core of these cases are based on an unusual legal theory that casts universities — who stood to benefit from recruits playing for wildly profitable basketball teams — as victims of fraud. What prosecutors call bribes, legal experts note, would be considered signing bonuses and referral fees in other industries. The payments are illicit only because the NCAA prohibits amateur athletes from making money from their talents and bars coaches from facilitating, and profiting from, meetings between agents and athletes. This is not to say that cheating in basketball recruiting has no consequences. One of them is that good people who don’t cheat will struggle to win games. That’s a shame, not a crime. To pursue this investigation with no fewer than 11 teams of FBI agents appears to represent a whole new category of March madness. \nIt’s also an interesting contrast to the intensity with which the bureau pursued its investigation of IRS targeting of President Obama’s philosophical adversaries after the scandal broke in 2013. Any reasonable person would surely say that the use of the nation’s tax enforcement authority to punish individual Americans for their beliefs is a far greater threat to the republic than possible compensation for college athletes. \nA month after the IRS abuses began coming to light, Rep. Jim Jordan (R., Ohio) asked then-FBI Director Robert Mueller about the case at a June 13, 2013 meeting of the House Judiciary Committee. Here’s an excerpt from the hearing transcript:\nJORDAN: Can you tell me -- can you tell me some basics? Can you tell me how many agents -- investigators -- you’ve assigned to the case? MUELLER: I may be able to do that, but I’d have to get back to you. JORDAN: Can you tell me who the lead investigator is? MUELLER: Off the top of my head, no. JORDAN: This is the most important issue in front of the country the last six weeks, you don’t know who’s heading up the case? Who the lead investigator is? MUELLER: At this junction, no, I do not know who the... JORDAN: Can you get that information to us? We’d like to know. We’d like to know how many people you’ve assigned to look into this situation. MUELLER: I have not had a recent briefing on it. I had a briefing on it when we first initiated it, but I have not had a recent briefing as to where we are... JORDAN: Do you know if you’ve talked to any of the victims? Have you talked to any of the groups who were targeted by their government? Have you met with any of the tea party folks since May 14th, 2013? MUELLER: I don’t know what the status of the interviews are by the team that’s on it. Several months later, Mr. Mueller handed off leadership of the bureau to James Comey, who seems to have cared about IRS targeting abuses just as much as Mr. Mueller did. Mr. Comey’s FBI spent less time investigating the IRS than the bureau has spent examining college basketball. The targeting investigation was shut down in 2015 without charges. The bureau’s basketball fun continues and, by the way, the FBI’s mechanism to collect tips on violent criminal activity is broken. \nIt’s hard to escape the conclusion that the FBI has become a sort of ministry of self-indulgence, pursuing cases that its leadership finds interesting or useful as opposed to prioritizing threats to our safety and liberty. \nThe real scandal is not about Donald Trump firing Mr. Mueller’s successor. The question is: What took him so long? \n***\nBye-ku to an Indian Temple \nArising, she sees\nA six-armed goddess. “Staff, note:\nGood for fundraising.”\n-- Myles C.
