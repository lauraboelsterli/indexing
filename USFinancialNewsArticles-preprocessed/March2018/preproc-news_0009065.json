    "text": "COLUMBIA, Md., March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Global performance improvement solutions provider GP Strategies Corporation (NYSE: GPX) today reported financial results for the quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nOverview of Fourth Quarter 2017 Results:\nRevenue of $131.5 million for fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $127.3 million for fourth quarter of 2016, and record annual revenue of $509.2 million for full year 2017 compared to $490.6 million in 2016 Loss of $(0.02) per share for fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $0.40 per share for fourth quarter of 2016 (Adjusted EPS of $0.38 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $0.40 per share for fourth quarter of 2016) Cash provided by operating activities of $26.3 million for year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $18.1 million in 2016 U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017, resulting in $3.2 million increased income tax expense, or $0.19 per share in fourth quarter of 2017\n\"We achieved record revenue in 2017 while concurrently undertaking substantial initiatives that we believe will result in long term growth and increased shareholder value,\" stated Scott N. Greenberg, Chief Executive Officer of GP Strategies. \"We are pleased to report that our master services agreement with our largest financial services customer has been extended for one year to July 2019. We are negotiating with the customer the terms of a new multi-year agreement. We are proud of the value we have delivered and the trust and confidence we have received from this major financial institution. While we had restructuring costs, investment in a new ERP system and a large unusual contract write-off in the oil and gas industry in 2017, the adjusted results and cash flow generated from operations clearly demonstrate our potential. In addition, with our renewed emphasis on acquisitions and our recently announced organizational and management team changes, we look forward to the future.\"\nThe Company's revenue increased $4.2 million or 3.3% during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 due to both organic growth and acquisitions. Revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 was $509.2 million, up $18.6 million or 3.8% from 2016 revenue of $490.6 million.\nOperating income decreased $6.6 million to $2.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $9.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 includes the following:\n$3.3 million of restructuring charges consisting primarily of severance expense in connection with the organizational changes announced in December 2017; $1.7 million of ERP system implementation costs; a $1.8 million loss on a contract with a foreign oil and gas client which was terminated in the fourth quarter of 2017 (Of the $1.8 million total loss, $0.5 million is included in cost of revenue relating to final wind down costs on the contract and $1.3 million is included in SG&A expense and represents a bad debt reserve relating to accounts receivable from the client. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $3.7 million of accounts receivable from this client, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts); a $1.3 million gain on the change in fair value of contingent consideration compared to a loss of $0.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016; and approximately $0.4 million of costs relating to the organizational changes including executive search fees and labor and benefits expense for transitioning personnel.\nThe Company continues to finalize its cost reduction plan announced in December 2017. Over the last few months, the Company has undertaken various cost-cutting measures to enable the Company to invest in key priorities and to reduce operating expenses. When completed, the Company anticipates savings, net of investments, to be in excess of $4 million on an annual basis and will see the impact of these reductions predominantly in the second half of 2018.\nSG&A expenses increased $4.3 million or 34.7% to $16.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $12.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase is primarily due to $1.7 million of ERP system implementation costs, a $1.4 million increase in bad debt expense, a $0.8 increase in labor and benefits expense and $0.3 million in executive search fees associated with the reorganization in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nInterest expense increased $1.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 due to contingent interest associated with unremitted value-added tax (VAT) from invoices raised in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to undercharged VAT from prior year client billings. Other income (expense) improved $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to a decrease in foreign currency transaction losses compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nIncome tax expense was $1.6 million, or a 128% effective income tax rate, for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $1.7 million, or a 20% effective income tax rate, for the fourth quarter of 2016. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. The Company recorded a provisional amount of $3.2 million of additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the impact of the tax reform in its income tax provision. This included a one-time transition tax of $4.6 million on the mandatory deemed repatriation of cumulative foreign earnings, which was offset by a $1.4 million tax benefit related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the lower tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future.\nNet loss was $0.3 million, or $(0.02) per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to net income of $6.7 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. The special items noted above had the effect of reducing earnings by a total of $0.40 per share. Net income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 was $12.9 million or $0.76 diluted earnings per share compared to $20.2 million or $1.21 diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash of $23.6 million compared to $16.3 million as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had long-term debt outstanding of $28.0 million. In addition, the Company had $37.7 million of short-term borrowings outstanding and $57.0 million of available borrowings under its line of credit as of December 31, 2017.\nCash provided by operating activities was $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $18.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased approximately 182,000 shares of its common stock in the open market for a total cost of approximately $4.3 million. As of December 31, 2017, there was approximately $11.7 million available for future repurchases under the buyback program.\nInvestor Call\nThe Company has scheduled an investor conference call for 10:00 a.m. ET on March 1, 2018.

The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in evaluating the Company's results.

In addition, because these measures may not be calculated identically by all companies, the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS to the most comparable GAAP equivalents, see the Non-GAAP Reconciliations, along with related footnotes, below.\nAbout GP Strategies\nGP Strategies Corporation (NYSE: GPX) is a global performance improvement solutions provider of sales and technical training, digital learning solutions, management consulting and engineering services.

In December 2017, the Company announced a new organizational structure effective January 1, 2018, in which it will be organized into two global segments aligned by complementary service lines and supported by a new business development organization aligned by industry sector. The Workforce Excellence segment will include the majority of the existing Learning Solutions segment and the Professional & Technical Services segment and the Business Transformation Services segment will include the majority of the Performance Readiness Solutions segment and the Sandy Training & Marketing segment. Certain business units will transfer between the existing operating segments to better align with the service offerings of the two new segments. The Company's operating results will be reported under this new organizational structure beginning with its financial statements for the first quarter ending March 31, 2018.\nGP STRATEGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation – Adjusted EBITDA (1)\n(In thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nQuarter ended\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(339)\n$\n6,732\n$\n12,891\n$\n20,247\nInterest expense\n1,649\n598\n3,132\n1,568\nIncome tax expense\n1,566\n1,715\n6,798\n9,787\nDepreciation and amortization\n1,821\n1,493\n6,974\n6,462\nNon-cash stock compensation expense\n1,438\n1,559\n6,314\n6,015\nRestructuring charges\n3,317\n—\n3,317\n—\n(Gain) loss on change in fair value of\ncontingent consideration, net\n(1,251)\n62\n(1,620)\n136\nERP implementation costs\n1,695\n—\n4,916\n—\nLoss on a contract with a foreign oil and gas\nclient\n1,750\n—\n4,383\n—\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n11,646\n$\n12,159\n$\n47,105\n$\n44,215\n(1) Adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) is a widely used non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance. It is presented as supplemental information that the Company believes is useful to investors to evaluate its results because it excludes certain items that are not directly related to the Company's core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back to net income interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock compensation expense, gain or loss on the change in fair value of contingent consideration and other unusual or infrequently occurring items such as restructuring charges. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a substitute either for net income, as an indicator of the Company's operating performance, or for cash flow, as a measure of the Company's liquidity. In addition, because Adjusted EBITDA may not be calculated identically by all companies, the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nGP STRATEGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation – Adjusted EPS (1)\n(In thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nQuarter ended\nYear ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nDiluted (loss) earnings per share\n$\n(0.02)\n$\n0.40\n$\n0.76\n$\n1.21\nRestructuring charges\n0.12\n—\n0.12\n—\n(Gain) loss on change in fair value of\ncontingent consideration, net\n(0.07)\n—\n(0.10)\n0.01\nU.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\n0.19\n—\n0.19\n—\nERP implementation costs\n0.06\n—\n0.18\n—\nLoss on a contract with a foreign oil and gas\nclient\n0.06\n—\n0.16\n—\nContingent interest on unremitted VAT\npayments\n0.04\n—\n0.04\n—\nAdjusted EPS\n$\n0.38\n$\n0.40\n$\n1.35\n$\n1.22\n(1) Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share (\"Adjusted EPS\"), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as earnings per diluted share excluding the gain or loss on the change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration and special charges, such as restructuring, the impact of U.S. tax reform enacted in December 2017, and other unusual or infrequently occurring items of income or expense. Management uses Adjusted EPS to assess total Company operating performance on a consistent basis. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure, which excludes the gain or loss on the change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration and other special charges, when considered together with our GAAP financial results, provides management and investors with an additional understanding of our business operating results, including underlying trends.\nGP STRATEGIES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n(Unaudited)\nCurrent assets:\nCash\n$\n23,612\n$\n16,346\nAccounts and other receivables\n119,335\n105,549\nCosts and estimated earnings in excess of\nbillings on uncompleted contracts\n42,958\n39,318\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n14,212\n11,481\nTotal current assets\n200,117\n172,694\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n5,123\n4,547\nGoodwill and other intangibles, net\n153,198\n133,597\nOther assets\n6,569\n4,763\nTotal assets\n$\n365,007\n$\n315,601\nCurrent liabilities:\nShort-term borrowings\n$\n37,696\n$\n17,694\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n12,000\n12,000\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n78,280\n64,596\nBillings in excess of costs and estimated\nearnings on uncompleted contracts\n22,356\n18,545\nTotal current liabilities\n150,332\n112,835\nLong-term debt\n16,000\n28,000\nOther noncurrent liabilities\n10,621\n7,270\nTotal liabilities\n176,953\n148,105\nTotal stockholders' equity\n188,054\n167,496\nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity\n$\n365,007\n$\n315,601\n© 2018 GP Strategies Corporation.
