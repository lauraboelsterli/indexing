    "text": "TOKYO, March 9 (Reuters) - Japan’s central bank kept policy unchanged on Friday and stuck to its upbeat view on the economy, underscoring its conviction that its massive stimulus programme is helping drive inflation towards its elusive target.\nFollowing are comments from BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda at his post-meeting news conference:\nPRICE EXPECTATIONS “Companies’ price-setting stance is likely to become more positive. Inflation expectations have emerged from weaknesses and seen heightening steadily. The economy is sustaining its momentum to achieve the BOJ’s price target.”\nMARKET VOLATILITY “Uncertainty over U.S. trade policy may be among factors behind the volatility. But economic fundamentals remain favourable and corporate profits, which are foundations of stock price moves, continue to be firm.”\n“The impact of market volatility on the economy remains limited for now. But we’ll closely watch how domestic and overseas market moves could affect Japan’s economy and prices.” (Reporting by Leika Kihara, Stanley White and Tetsushi Kajimoto; Editing by Sam Holmes and Himani Sarkar)\n ",
