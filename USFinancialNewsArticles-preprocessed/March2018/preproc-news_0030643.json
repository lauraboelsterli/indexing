    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Assurant, Inc. , (NYSE:AIZ), a global provider of risk management solutions, today announced the closing of its previously announced public offering of 2,875,000 shares, or $287.5 million aggregate liquidation preference, of its 6.50% Series D Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share (“mandatory convertible preferred stock”) at a public offering price of $100.00 per share, which includes the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 375,000 additional shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock to cover over-allotments.\nThe net proceeds from the sale of the mandatory convertible preferred stock will be approximately $276.7 million (which includes the proceeds of the exercise, in full, of the underwriters’ option to purchase an additional 375,000 shares) after deducting the underwriting discounts and the estimated offering expenses payable by the company. The company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering together with proceeds from the issuance of new indebtedness, cash on hand and common stock consideration, to fund the company’s previously announced acquisition of TWG Holdings Limited, refinance its existing 2.50% Senior Notes due 2018 and pay related fees and expenses.\nUnder certain circumstances the mandatory convertible preferred stock is subject to redemption at Assurant’s option, in whole but not in part, if the acquisition is not consummated. If for any reason the acquisition of TWG Holdings Limited is not consummated (and if Assurant does not exercise its option to redeem the mandatory convertible preferred stock), the net proceeds from this offering would be available for the refinancing of the 2018 Senior Notes and general corporate purposes.\nThe offering of the mandatory convertible preferred stock and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the mandatory convertible preferred stock was registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC acted as joint book running managers for the offering.\nAn effective shelf registration statement, under which the mandatory convertible preferred stock and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the mandatory convertible preferred stock was issued, was filed previously with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The offering and sale of the mandatory convertible preferred stock and the common stock issuable upon conversion of the mandatory convertible preferred stock was made only by means of a prospectus and an accompanying prospectus supplement related to the offering. You can get copies of these documents for free by visiting EDGAR at the SEC website at www.sec.gov . Alternatively, copies of the prospectus and prospectus supplement, when available, may be obtained by contacting Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Attention: Prospectus Department, 180 Varick Street, 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10014; J.P.
