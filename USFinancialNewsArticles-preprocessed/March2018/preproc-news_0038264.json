    "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., March 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Airware Labs Corporation (OTC:AIRW) (“Airware” or the “Company”) today announced the closing of its acquisition of BSSD Group, LLC, doing business as Item 9 Labs, completed through a share exchange agreement. The Company previously announced its intention to acquire Item 9 Labs in a non-binding letter of intent. As part of the transaction, Airware closed on a material definitive financing agreement in the principal amount of $1 million. The gross proceeds will be used by the Company for general working capital purposes.\nItem 9 Labs owns the largest approved manufacturing and cultivation area in the U.S. with 50 acres in Southern Arizona. Currently, Item 9 is utilizing five acres and intends to implement the remaining 45 acres in accordance with its three-year strategic plan. The property includes a 10,000 square foot, state-of-the-art manufacturing facility with 10,000 square feet of additional capacity already under construction. The additional capacity will include a commercial kitchen for infused co-branded products. As part of its growth strategy, the Company is in the process of opening additional cultivation and extraction locations in Massachusetts. Presently, Item 9 has an annualized revenue run rate of approximately $3 million.\nBryce Skalla, Co-Founder & CEO of Item 9 Labs, commented, “We are pleased to have closed on our previously announced transaction with Airware Labs, combining a high-quality, medical-grade product, with a unique, proprietary delivery platform, for the first time in the industry. Item 9 will utilize Airware Labs proprietary technology to create a first to market medicated nasal delivery device that provides specific cannabinoid dosing utilizing the nasal mucus-membrane. The groundbreaking method of administration will revolutionize the Cannabis sector, positioning Item 9 as an industry leader in the Cannabis Bio-Medical space.”\n“Since its inception, Airware has developed a comprehensive array of air filtration and nasal dilation products utilizing our patented IP as a nasal delivery device to effectively deliver Cannabinoids into the human body. We look forward to collaborating with the Item 9 team and their proven high quality medical marijuana products. Together, we will continue to promote improved airflow for increased metabolism, improved circulation and detoxification and to support better overall health,” said Jeffrey Rassas, CEO of Airware Labs Corp.\nAbout Item 9 Labs:\nItem 9 Labs is an Arizona-based cannabis consulting company with a proven record of high quality medical marijuana flower and products focused on organic cost-effective solutions for whole body health. Item 9 Labs owns and operates 50 acres in Southern Arizona, the largest property zoned to grow and cultivate the medical marijuana flower. Many cannabis manufacturers have moved their focus to hydroponic techniques that utilize harsh chemicals and nutrients, hindering the bioavailability of their product. Item 9 Labs maintains plant derived natural soil media and nutrient regiments, which it believes generates a superior product through enhanced taste, smell, and effect increasing customer demand. As a direct result of these organic farming techniques, Item 9 Labs' medicine sells at a price that is 5-10% higher than its state competitors.\nAbout Airware Labs Corporation:\nAirware Labs Corp's products are patented and address key consumer health and quality of life challenges including intra-nasal delivery of drugs and therapeutic oils.
