    "text": "DeVos, Long Opposed to Federal Gun Control, Takes on School Safety \nMarch 12, 2018 7:37 p.m. ET \nWASHINGTON—Education Secretary \nBetsy DeVos \nhas long been a critic of federal gun control and has focused on what she calls lax policies on school discipline, signaling her likely priorities as head of a new commission on school safety. \nThe panel, which the White House announced Sunday as part of a larger school-safety strategy, is charged with studying a range of issues, including a proposal to raise the minimum age for firearms purchases and the impact that videogames and the media have on violence. \nPresident \nDonald Trump \ninitially backed the idea of new age restrictions on gun purchases before delegating it to the commission for further study . When Mrs. DeVos was asked in her confirmation hearing last year whether firearms should be allowed near schools, she said such decisions were best left to local communities while also citing a need for some rural schools to have firearms to protect children from wildlife and “potential grizzlies.” \nHer agency has also signaled a desire to reverse guidelines advanced by the Democratic administration of former President \nBarack Obama \nthat were aimed at making sure school-discipline policies don’t unduly impact minority students, another question the commission is tasked with considering. \nSome conservatives argue those guidelines have created an overall lax disciplinary atmosphere. Calls to reverse the guidance have grown louder with lawmakers, led by Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.), blaming the policy in part for creating a culture in which the accused gunman in last month’s shooting at a Parkland, Fla., high school wasn’t suspended or brought to the attention of law enforcement for concerning behavior. \nGun-control and school advocates, already frustrated that Mr. Trump, a Republican, appears to be backing away from earlier statements supportive of gun control, worry that Mrs. DeVos’s new role could help quash the push for such measures. \n“How many times did she say, ‘Everything is on the table?’ But everything isn’t on the table,” said \nNoelle Ellerson, \nassociate executive director of AASA, the school superintendents association. “We can’t talk about access to weapons, about universal background checks.” \nAt the same time, Mrs. DeVos’s rocky performance in a television interview Sunday has prompted renewed questions about her lack of administrative experience and relatively scant familiarity with public schools, having spent the bulk of her career advocating for private-school choice. \nMrs. DeVos struggled to explain in a CBS interview how her advocacy for charter schools in her home state of Michigan had benefited students. When Mrs. DeVos was asked if she had visited some of the schools that are struggling the most, she said, “I have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming. Maybe I should.” \nJeanne Allen, \nCEO of the Center For Education Reform, which supports Mrs. DeVos’s school-choice goals, said that “it would do her a world of good to go deeper on issues before she goes on TV.” \nMike Petrilli, president of the conservative-leaning Fordham Institute, said Mrs. DeVos was a deft behind-the-scenes strategist in steering the school-choice movement. But as secretary, he said, she hasn’t served as an effective national spokeswoman, raising concerns about her ability to spearhead the response to a major tragedy. \n“The problem is, she’s not very good at [using] the bully pulpit,” Mr. Petrilli said. \nAdministration officials declined to comment on the CBS interview. White House press secretary \nSarah Sanders \nsaid the president is focused on school safety, “not one or two interviews.” Elizabeth Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, said Mrs. DeVos “is humbled by the opportunity to lead this commission.” \nMore broadly, Mrs. DeVos’s supporters said her authentic, sometimes unpolished manner reflects heartfelt beliefs and a career outside the educational bureaucracy. \nOne unknown is the commission’s other members, who will presumably help determine its direction. A White House official said Sunday that other government officials would sit on the panel, and Mrs. DeVos said she hopes to include teachers. —Michael C.
