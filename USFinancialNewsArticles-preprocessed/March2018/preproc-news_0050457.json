    "text": "BEIJING, March 28 (Reuters) - London copper prices ticked upward for a second day on Wednesday as the U.S. dollar, which had gained about 0.3 percent overnight, lost ground on lingering global trade tensions. A weaker greenback makes metals cheaper for holders of other currencies and can support prices. FUNDAMENTALS * LME COPPER: Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) was up 0.2 percent at $6,665 a tonne by 0219 GMT, extending a 0.7 percent gain in the previous session. * SHFE COPPER: The most-traded May copper contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange gained 0.3 percent to 49,590 yuan ($7,898.01) a tonne. * OTHER METALS: The entire Shanghai base metals complex moved forward as the dollar index slipped by 0.1 percent to 89.29, while aluminium was flat in London and LME lead shed 0.3 percent. * COPPER: Vedanta Resources Plc said on Tuesday its India unit Vedanta Ltd's copper smelting operations at Thootukudi, in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, will be closed for about 15 days as part of a maintenance shutdown. * ALUMINIUM: China's northern province of Shanxi on Tuesday offered some of the country's biggest aluminium companies preferential access to bauxite resources if they transfer smelting capacity to the region. * ALUMINA: The Alunorte refinery in northern Brazil, owned by Norway's Norsk Hydro ASA, will start shutting down half of its alumina capacity in the next two weeks to preserve equipment, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
