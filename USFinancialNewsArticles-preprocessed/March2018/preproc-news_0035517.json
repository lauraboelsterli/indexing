We opened 15 stores and continued to expand our retail store footprint into the Eastern and Western United States. Net sales in our men’s business grew 22% and our women’s business grew 37%, exceeding the $100 million milestone and accounting for almost a quarter of our total annual sales. This marks our 32 nd consecutive quarter of increased net sales year-over-year,” said Stephanie Pugliese, Chief Executive Officer of Duluth Trading.\n“With each new store opening, we are attracting more customers to the Duluth Trading brand and during fiscal 2017, new customers acquired through our retail segment accounted for 25% of total new customer growth. We continue to see higher sales growth in markets with an established store, which supports our long-term strategy to significantly expand our total market opportunity through continued strength in online capabilities and the full expression of the brand in a brick and mortar setting.”\n“Looking ahead to 2018, we intend to greatly enhance our customers’ omnichannel experience with the completion of the order management system and e-commerce platform in the first half of the year. We plan to open 15 new stores that will reach into major customer markets like Texas and that will give us a coast-to-coast presence from Portland, Maine to Portland, Oregon. We are making investments to ensure the long-term growth potential of our business and are underway with executing our 2018 plan.”\nOperating Results for the Fourth Quarter Ended January 28, 2018\nNet sales increased 24.7% to $217.8 million, compared to $174.7 million in the same period a year ago. The net sales increase was driven by a 8.5% growth in direct net sales and a 98.8% growth in retail net sales, with growth in all product categories and in both men’s and women’s business. The increase in retail net sales was attributable to the opening of 15 new retail stores during fiscal 2017.\nGross profit increased 19.9% to $116.0 million, or 53.3% of net sales, compared to $96.8 million, or 55.4% of net sales, in the corresponding prior-year period. The 210 basis point decrease in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in global promotional days and flash sales, coupled with the continuing decline in shipping revenues.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 17.0% to $86.5 million, compared to $73.9 million in the same period a year ago. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 260 basis points to 39.7%, compared to 42.3% in the corresponding prior-year period. As a percentage of net sales, advertising and marketing costs decreased 370 basis points to 16.4% compared to 20.1% in the corresponding prior-year period, primarily due to a planned decrease in catalog spend coupled with a decline in digital and television advertising as percentage of net sales, primarily attributable to leverage gained from higher retail net sales. As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses increased 40 basis points to 14.1%, compared to 13.7% in the corresponding prior-year period, primarily due to an increase in customer service expense due to retail store growth, partially offset by leverage in shipping expenses due to increase proportion of retail net sales. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses increased 70 basis points to 9.2% compared to 8.5% in the corresponding prior-year period, primarily due to store occupancy, depreciation, and personnel expenses.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nThe Company ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $2.9 million, with net working capital of $51.5 million, and no borrowings on its $60.0 million revolving line of credit.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\nFiscal 2018 outlook is provided on a 53-week period, compared to a 52-week period in fiscal 2017.\nNet sales in the range of $555.0 million to $575.0 million Adjusted EBITDA 1 in the range of $51.0 million to $54.0 million EPS in the range of $0.79 to $0.84 per diluted share, with an effective tax rate of 26% based on the Company’s provisional estimates from the impacts of the Tax Act Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from finance lease obligations of, $45.0 million to $55.0 million 2 15 new store openings, adding 240,000 to 250,000 of additional gross square footage\n1 See Reconciliation of forecasted net income to forecasted EBITDA and forecasted EBITDA to forecasted Adjusted EBITDA in the accompanying financial tables.\n2 Fiscal 2018 capital expenditures primarily include the Company’s plan to open 15 retail stores, investments in technology and infrastructure improvements.\nThe table below recaps the Company’s fiscal 2017 stores and signed new store leases for fiscal 2018 along with the opening timeframe.\nFISCAL 2017 STORES FISCAL 2018 STORES as of March 20, 2018 Gross Gross Location Square Footage Location Timing Square Footage Noblesville, IN 14,557 Anchorage, AK Opened March 1, 2018 25,409 Burlington, MA 16,360 West Fargo, ND Opening March 22, 2018 14,557 Macomb, MI 16,474 Portland, OR Q1 Fiscal 2018 19,075 Warwick, RI 14,528 Colorado Springs, CO Q2 Fiscal 2018 12,410 West Chester, OH 14,557 Lubbock, TX Q2 Fiscal 2018 15,536 Pittsburgh, PA 14,557 Denton, TX Q2 Fiscal 2018 14,557 Red Wing, MN (1) 14,049 Columbus, OH Q2 Fiscal 2018 14,749 St. Charles, MO 12,960 Arlington, TX Q2 Fiscal 2018 15,536 Thornton, CO 20,015 Oklahoma City, OK Q3 Fiscal 2018 15,536 Avon, OH 14,557 South Portland, ME Q3 Fiscal 2018 12,951 Louisville, KY 15,456 Canton, OH Q3 Fiscal 2018 14,557 Woodbury, MN 14,950 Golden, CO Q3 Fiscal 2018 20,218 Grandville, MI 14,557 Waukesha, WI 15,536 Wixom, MI 14,557 1 Gross square footage excludes space used as a call center.\nConference Call Information\nA conference call and audio webcast with analysts and investors will be held on Tuesday, March 20, 2018 at 9:30 am Eastern Time, to discuss the results and answer questions.\nLive conference call: 844-875-6915 (domestic) or 412-317-6711 (international) Conference call replay available through April 3, 2018: 877-344-7529 (domestic) or 412-317-0088 (international) Replay access code: 10117036 Live and archived webcast: ir.duluthtrading.com\nThe Company is enabling investors to pre-register for the earnings conference call so that they can expedite their entry into the call and avoid the need to wait for a live operator.

Within this release, including the tables attached hereto, reference is made to adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). See attached Table “Reconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA and EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA,” for a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months and fiscal year ended January 28, 2018, versus the three months and fiscal year ended January 29, 2017. See also attached Table “Reconciliation of Forecasted Net Income to Forecasted EBITDA and Forecasted EBITDA to Forecasted Adjusted EBITDA,” for a reconciliation of forecasted net income to forecasted EBITDA and forecasted EBITDA to forecasted adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal year ending February 3, 2019. Adjusted EBITDA is a metric used by management and frequently used by the financial community, which provides insight into an organization’s operating trends and facilitates comparisons between peer companies, since interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies. Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain items that are unusual in nature or not comparable from period to period. The Company provides this information to investors to assist in comparisons of past, present and future operating results and to assist in highlighting the results of on-going operations. While the Company’s management believes that non-GAAP measurements are useful supplemental information, such adjusted results are not intended to replace the Company’s GAAP financial results and should be read in conjunction with those GAAP results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
