High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein told a news conference on Friday. FILE PHOTO: Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, addresses the Human Rights Council at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland February 26, 2018. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse /File Photo “These attacks cannot go unanswered, the U.N. Human Rights Council must take a position,” Zeid said, after Duterte’s government sought to get a U.N. investigator, a former Philippine lawmaker and four former Catholic priests declared as “terrorists”. “He needs to submit himself to some sort of psychiatric examination. This kind of comment is unacceptable, unacceptable,” Zeid said. Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay and Tom Miles",
