    "text": "CARLSBAD, Calif., March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alphatec Holdings, Inc. (“Alphatec” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:ATEC), a provider of innovative spine surgery solutions with a mission to improve patient lives through the relentless pursuit of superior outcomes, today announced financial results for fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017, and provided guidance for 2018.\n2017 Financial Highlights\nQuarter Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Total revenue $ 26.3 million $101.7 million U.S. commercial revenue $ 20.9 million $ 86.9 million U.S. gross margin 69.9% 69.8% Operating expenses $ 18.9 million $ 71.3 million Non-GAAP operating expenses $ 16.3 million $ 66.0 million Loss from operations $(3.6) million $ (9.0) million Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA $ 1.0 million $ 3.8 million Cash burn Less than $0.1 million $ 21.5 million “ We closed 2017 with solid momentum, and on excellent footing to continue to drive ATEC’s advancement into an innovative, growth organization,” said Terry Rich, President and Chief Operating Officer. “Throughout the year, we demonstrated great progress with the transition of our sales channel and aggressively managed expenses and cash. We have an exceptionally strong understanding of what it will take to achieve our vision and the strongest team in spine to accomplish it.”\nComparison of Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter 2017 to Third Quarter 2017\nFollowing is a table, comparing key fourth quarter 2017 results to third quarter 2017 results. At this time, the Company believes that sequential results are the best indicators of performance. These are the comparisons management uses in its own evaluation of continuing operating performance given the re-focus of the Company’s strategy under a new leadership team.\nThree Months Ended Change December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 $000's % (unaudited) U.S. commercial revenue $ 20,949 $ 20,662 $ 287 1.4 % U.S gross profit 14,639 14,280 359 2.5 % U.S. gross margin 69.9 % 69.1 % Operating Expenses Research and development $ 1,437 $ 1,044 $ 393 37.6 % Sales and marketing 9,742 10,015 (273 ) (2.8 %) General and administrative 7,243 4,403 2,840 64.5 % Amortization of intangible assets 172 172 - Restructuring expenses 308 139 169 121.6 % Gain on sale of assets - - - Total operating expenses $ 18,902 $ 15,773 $ 3,129 19.8 % Operating loss $ (3,608 ) $ (1,261 ) $ (2,347 ) (186.1 %) Gain on change in warrant fair value $ 12,044 $ - $ 12,044 NM Gain (loss) from continuing operations $ 6,589 $ (3,076 ) $ 9,665 314.2 % Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA $ 958 $ 1,126 $ (168 ) (14.9 %) U.S. commercial revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $20.9 million, up $0.2 million compared to $20.7 million in the third quarter of 2017. While U.S. commercial revenue was essentially flat on a sequential basis, the percentage of revenue generated by dedicated agents and distributors increased to 40% up from approximately 30% in the third quarter of 2017. Revenue growth generated by the dedicated sales channel has begun to offset the revenue impacts associated with transitioning or discontinuing non-strategic distributor relationships.\nU.S. gross profit and gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $14.6 million and 69.9%, respectively, compared to $14.3 million and 69.1%, respectively, for the third quarter of 2017. U.S. gross margin has stabilized as the Company continues to optimize its supply chain.\nTotal operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $18.9 million, reflecting an increase of $3.1 million compared to $15.8 million in the third quarter of 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, excluding restructuring charges and stock-based compensation, total operating expenses in the fourth quarter increased from $15.2 million to $16.3 million, reflecting increased investments in product development and leadership.\nGAAP loss from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.6 million, compared to a loss of $1.3 million for the third quarter of 2017, of which $1.9 million of the additional loss was attributed to an increase in non-cash, stock-based compensation.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $1.0 million, compared to $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2017. For more detailed information, please refer to the table, “Alphatec Holdings, Inc. Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures,” that follows.\nGain on change in fair value of warrants in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $12.0 million, representing the change in fair value of certain warrants to purchase common stock that were temporarily classified as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet, and subsequently reclassified as stockholders’ equity, in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance.\nCurrent and long-term debt includes $32.4 million in term debt and $10.3 million outstanding under the Company’s revolving credit facility at December 31, 2017. This compares to $33.0 million in term debt and $9.2 million outstanding under the Company’s revolving credit facility at September 30, 2017.\nCash and cash equivalents were $22.5 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $15.4 million reported at September 30, 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company received additional equity investments of $3.7 million and generated cash proceeds of $3.3 million from the exercise of warrants.\nComparison of Financial Results for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nRevenue decreased on a year-over-year basis as a result of the Company’s execution of its sales organization transition and the impact of lost revenue related to the financial and operational challenges the Company faced in 2016 prior to the sale of its international business. The year-over-year improvement in operating expenses is the result of a comprehensive initiative to reduce costs and drive operational efficiencies. For additional information, please reference the following financial statement tables and the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or about March 9, 2018.\n2018 Financial Outlook\nAlphatec expects total revenue in 2018 to approximate $95.0 million, an increase in the U.S. commercial revenue run rate reported for the second half of 2017.\nRich continued, “As the transition of our distribution channel progresses, top-line visibility will continue to be somewhat limited as we discontinue non-strategic relationships and navigate the contracting process to execute each transition. However, I am proud to say that we are beginning to see our efforts reach fruition. As 2018 progresses, we expect that sales from the dedicated portion of our channel will continue to offset the negative revenue impacts associated with transitioning or discontinuing non-strategic distributor relationships.”\nInvestor Conference Call\nAlphatec will hold a conference today at 2:30 p.m. PT / 5:30 p.m. ET to discuss the results.
