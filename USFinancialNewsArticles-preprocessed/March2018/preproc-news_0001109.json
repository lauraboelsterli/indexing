    "text": "WESTFORD, Mass., March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Ribbon Communications Inc. (Nasdaq: RBBN), a global leader in secure and intelligent cloud communications, today announced results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\n\"I'm very pleased to have concluded the merger transaction and the launch of Ribbon in the marketplace. Ribbon's increased scale, global footprint, expanded product offerings and combined customer base will benefit our customers, who count on us as trusted long-term partners,\" said Fritz Hobbs, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"The combined company's performance through the end of the year met or exceeded all of our guidance. We made solid progress on operationalizing cost synergies and now expect well over $50 million in cost synergies in 2018,\" continued Hobbs.\n\"Ribbon delivered solid fourth quarter results driven by strength in our SBC sales. Our merger integration plans kicked off in earnest and we made substantial progress,\" said Daryl Raiford, Chief Financial Officer. \"Looking to 2018, we are guiding for Adjusted EBITDA of $75 million, a dramatic increase over 2017,\" continued Raiford.\nQ417 Customer Highlights:\nAwarded a large Asian network interconnect deal based on cloud and GPU (graphics processing unit) technology, demonstrating Ribbon's highly differentiated NFV (network functions virtualization) strategy and evidence of the secular shift to virtualization and cloud architecture. This deal is expected to generate revenue in early 2019. Booked a significant gateway trunking contract with a large U.S. MSO (multiple system operator), illustrating the continued demand by MSOs to transform their legacy networks to IP. Booked new network transformation projects for three service providers in Canada. A large North American Tier 1 service provider deployed Ribbon's Converged Intelligent Messaging NFV solution, supporting business and residential customers, highlighting further progress on network virtualization.\nQ417 Financial Highlights 1,2\nGAAP total revenue was $146.2 million, compared to $67.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP total revenue was $169.5 million, compared to $67.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. GAAP net loss was $15.7 million, compared to $2.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. GAAP loss per share was $0.18, compared to $0.05 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.27, compared to $0.09 in the fourth quarter of 2016. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA was $27.8 million, compared to $7.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFY17 Financial Highlights 1,2\nGAAP total revenue was $329.9 million, compared to $252.6 million in 2016. Non-GAAP total revenue was $353.2 million, compared to $252.6 million in 2016. GAAP net loss was $35.3 million, compared to $13.9 million in 2016. GAAP loss per share was $0.60, compared to $0.28 in 2016. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.51, compared to $0.33 in 2016. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA was $40.9 million, compared to $26.1 million in 2016.\nCash and investments were $83.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $131.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to net cash of $43 million used for the merger of Sonus and GENBAND. Cash flow from operations was basically break-even for the quarter.\n1 The Sonus-GENBAND merger occurred on October 27, 2017. The consolidated financial results included in this press release represent the consolidated financial results of Sonus Networks, Inc., prior to October 27, 2017, and the consolidated financial results of Ribbon, on and after such date. The financial results of GENBAND are included in Ribbon's consolidated financial results beginning October 27, 2017.\n2 Please see the reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures, and additional information about non-GAAP measures, in the press release appendix.\nConference Call Details\nThe Company will offer a live, listen-only webcast of the conference call to discuss the complete financial results of Ribbon for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 on March 1, 2018, via the investor section of its website at http://investors.ribboncommunications.com/ , where a replay will also be available shortly following the conference call.\nConference call details:\nDate: March 1, 2018\nTime: 8:30 a.m. (ET)\nDial-in number: 888-224-7971 - International callers: +1-303-223-4386\nReplay information:\nA telephone playback of the call will be available following the conference call until March 15, 2018 and can be accessed by calling 800-633-8284 or +1-402-977-9140 for international callers.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nDiscussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nRibbon management uses several different financial measures, both GAAP and non-GAAP, in analyzing and assessing the overall performance of the business, making operating decisions, planning and forecasting future periods, and determining payments under compensation programs. Our annual financial plan is prepared both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, and the non-GAAP annual financial plan is approved by our board of directors. Continuous budgeting and forecasting for revenue and expenses are conducted on a non-GAAP basis (in addition to GAAP) and actual results on a non-GAAP basis are assessed against the annual financial plan. We consider the use of non-GAAP financial measures helpful in assessing the core performance of our continuing operations and when planning and forecasting future periods. By continuing operations, we mean the ongoing results of the business adjusted for acquisition-related revenue as a result of purchase accounting and the related cost of revenue, the impact of the new revenue standard, and excluding certain expenses and credits, including, but not limited to stock-based compensation, amortization and impairment of intangible assets, merger integration costs, settlement expense, certain litigation costs, acquisition- and integration-related expense, restructuring, certain gains included in other income, net, and income tax benefits arising from purchase accounting and tax reform. While our management uses non-GAAP financial measures as a tool to enhance their understanding of certain aspects of our financial performance, our management does not consider these measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measures. In addition, our presentations of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives for, or in isolation from, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nInvestors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In particular, many of the adjustments to Ribbon's financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future.\nAcquisition-Related Revenue and Cost of Revenue; Impact of New Revenue Standard\nWe provide the supplementary non-GAAP financial measures, Non-GAAP Product revenue, Non-GAAP Service revenue and Non-GAAP Total revenue, which include revenue related to the acquisition of GENBAND that we would have recognized but for the purchase accounting treatment of these transactions. Because GAAP accounting requires the elimination of this revenue, as well as the impact on future revenue of our adoption in 2018 of the new revenue standard, GAAP results alone do not fully capture all of our economic activities. These non-GAAP adjustments are intended to reflect the full amounts of such revenue and the related cost of revenue. We also add back the revenue related to the acquisition of GENBAND and the related cost of such revenue when calculating other of our non-GAAP operating results. We include these adjustments, which primarily relate to the acquisition of GENBAND, to allow for more complete comparisons to the financial results of our historical operations, forward-looking guidance and the financial results of peer companies. We believe these adjustments are useful to management and investors as a measure of the ongoing performance of the business because, although we cannot be certain that customers will renew the relevant GENBAND contracts, we have historically experienced high renewal rates on maintenance and support agreements and certain other customer contracts. These adjustments do not accelerate revenue, but instead include revenue (and the related cost of revenue) that would have been recognized in our 2017 results, and included in our 2018 guidance and results, but for the purchase accounting and new revenue standard adjustments required by GAAP.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is different from other forms of compensation, as it is a non-cash expense. For example, a cash salary generally has a fixed and unvarying cash cost. In contrast, the expense associated with an equity-based award is generally unrelated to the amount of cash ultimately received by the employee, and the cost to us is based on a stock-based compensation valuation methodology, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types, all of which may vary over time. We evaluate performance without these measures because stock-based compensation expense is influenced by the Company's stock price and other factors such as volatility and interest rates that are beyond our control. The expense related to stock-based awards is generally not controllable in the short-term and can vary significantly based on the timing, size and nature of awards granted. As such, we do not include such charges in our operating plans, and we believe that presenting non-GAAP operating results that exclude stock-based compensation provides investors with visibility and insight into our management's method of analysis and the Company's core operating performance. Stock-based compensation will continue in future periods.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nWe exclude the amortization of acquired intangible assets from non-GAAP expense and income measures. These amortization amounts are inconsistent in frequency and amount and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions. Although we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets from our non-GAAP expenses, we believe that it is important for investors to understand that intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. We believe that excluding the non-cash amortization of intangible assets facilitates the comparison of our financial results to our historical operating results and to other companies in our industry as if the acquired intangible assets had been developed internally rather than acquired. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets.\nImpairment of Intangible Assets\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we discontinued our ongoing development of certain intangible assets that we had previously acquired, as we had determined that there were no alternative uses of the technology within either our existing or future product lines. As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of $5.5 million to write down the carrying value of the assets to zero. Had we developed those intangible assets internally and made the decision to discontinue their ongoing development, we would have ceased work on such development projects and eliminated the related future costs. Because we do not capitalize these costs, there would have been no asset to write off. As a result, we believe that excluding non-cash impairment charges from our non-GAAP operating results as if these impaired intangible assets had been developed internally rather than acquired facilitates a comparison to our historical operating results and to other companies in our industry.\nSettlement Expense\nIn September 2017, we recorded $1.6 million of expense related to potential fines in connection with the ongoing SEC investigation and an additional $0.3 million of expense in connection with this matter in December 2017. In June 2016, we recorded $0.6 million for patent litigation settlement costs. These amounts are included as components of general and administrative expense. We believe that such settlement costs are not part of our core business or ongoing operations, are unplanned and generally not within our control. Accordingly, we believe that excluding costs such as the SEC potential fines and patent litigation settlement expense facilitates the comparison of our financial results to our historical operating results and to other companies in our industry.\nLitigation Costs\nIn connection with certain ongoing litigation between GENBAND, as plaintiff, and one of its competitors, we incurred litigation costs in the fourth quarter of 2017, and expect to incur significant future litigation costs. These costs are included as a component of general and administrative expense. We believe that such costs are not part of our core business or ongoing operations, are unplanned and generally not within our control. Accordingly, we believe that excluding the litigation costs related to this specific legal matter facilitates the comparison of our financial results to our historical operating results and to other companies in our industry.\nAcquisition- and Integration-Related Costs\nWe consider certain acquisition- and integration-related costs to be unpredictable and dependent on a significant number of factors that may be outside of our control. We do not consider these acquisition- and integration-related costs to be related to the organic continuing operations of our acquired businesses or to the Company and they are generally not relevant to assessing or estimating the long-term performance of the acquired assets. In addition, the size, complexity and/or volume of an acquisition, which often drives the magnitude of acquisition- and integration-related costs, may not be indicative of future acquisition- and integration-related costs. By excluding these acquisition- and integration-related costs from our non-GAAP measures, management is better able to evaluate our ability to utilize our existing assets and estimate the long-term value that acquired assets will generate for us. We exclude certain acquisition- and integration-related costs to allow more accurate comparisons of our financial results to our historical operations, forward-looking guidance and the financial results of less acquisitive peer companies. In addition, we believe that providing supplemental non-GAAP measures that exclude these items allows management and investors to consider the ongoing operations of the business both with and without such expenses.\nRestructuring\nWe have recorded restructuring expense to streamline operations and reduce operating costs by closing and consolidating certain facilities and reducing our worldwide workforce. We review our restructuring accruals regularly and record adjustments (both expense and credits) to these estimates as required. We believe that excluding restructuring expense and credits facilitates the comparison of our financial results to our historical operating results and to other companies in our industry, as there are no future revenue streams or other benefits associated with these costs.\nGain on Sales of Intangible Assets\nIn both 2017 and 2016, we sold intangible assets that we had acquired in connection with two previous acquisitions. These amounts, aggregating $0.6 million in 2017 and $1.3 million in 2016, are included as components of other income, net. We believe that such gains are not part of our core business or ongoing operations, as we had not used the intangible assets in connection with revenue-producing activities and would not have used them as such in the future. Accordingly, we believe that excluding the other income arising from these sales from our results facilitates the comparison of our financial results to our historical results and to other companies in our industry.\nTax Benefits Arising from Purchase Accounting and Tax Reform\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we assessed our ability to use our tax benefits and determined that it was more likely than not that some of these benefits will be recognized. As a result, the valuation allowance was reduced in connection with the GENBAND transaction, resulting in an income tax benefit of $16.4 million. In addition, we recognized an income tax benefit of $4.8 million related to the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017. We believe that such benefits are not part of our core business or ongoing operations, as they are either the result of acquisitions or new tax legislation, neither of which relates to our revenue-producing activities. Accordingly, we believe that excluding the benefits arising from these adjustments to our income tax provision facilitates the comparison of our financial results to our historical results and to other companies in our industry.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to review and assess our performance. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA by excluding from net income (loss): interest income (expense), net; income tax benefit (provision); depreciation; and amortization and impairment of intangible assets. In addition, we exclude from net income (loss): adjustments to revenue and cost of revenue related to revenue reductions resulting from purchase accounting; stock-based compensation; settlement expense; certain litigation costs; acquisition- and integration-related expense; restructuring; and other income, net. In general, we add back the expenses that we consider to be non-cash and/or not part of our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is used by our investing community for comparative and valuation purposes. We disclose this metric to support and facilitate our dialogue with research analysts and investors. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nWe believe that providing non-GAAP information to investors, in addition to the GAAP presentation, will allow investors to view the financial results in the way management views them. We further believe that providing this information helps investors to better understand our core financial and operating performance and evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by our management to evaluate and measure such performance.\nInvestor Relations:\nSara Leggat\n+1 (978) 614-8841\nsleggat@rbbn.com\nUS Press\nDennis Watson\n+1 (214) 695
