    "text": "March 16, 2018 / 8:46 AM / Updated 23 minutes ago Bale will get valuable playing time in China, says Wales' Giggs Reuters Staff 2 Min Read (Reuters) - The China Cup offers Wales midfielder Gareth Bale the perfect opportunity to get some minutes under his belt as he tries to put a run of games together in another season blighted by injury, manager Ryan Giggs has said. Soccer Football - La Liga Santander - Real Madrid vs Getafe - Santiago Bernabeu, Madrid, Spain - March 3, 2018 Real Madrid’s Gareth Bale during the warm up before the match REUTERS/Susana Vera - RC162F77D680 Wales face China in Nanning on March 22 while Uruguay meet Czech Republic the following day. Giggs’s side play again three days later, either in the final or the third-place playoff. “All players that go out are preparing for playing both games,” Giggs told British media. “There are players for who it is an ideal trip to get games and minutes under their belt - and it is for Gareth.” Bale was a substitute in both of Real Madrid’s Champions League last-16 games against Paris St Germain. The 28-year-old has struggled with injuries in the last two seasons and he has a fight on his hands to win back his starting spot in the Spanish side. “I was at the first game (against Paris St Germain) where he came on and did well in the last 20-25 minutes, and there’s a case with a lot players where they need games,” said Giggs, who took over as Wales boss in January.
