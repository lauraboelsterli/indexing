The 3.875% Notes will be redeemed on a pro rata basis.\nThe 5.500% Notes will be redeemed at a redemption price equal to the greater of (x) 100% of the principal amount of such 5.500% Notes being redeemed and (y) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on such 5.500% Notes being redeemed that would be due after the Redemption Date but for such redemption (exclusive of interest accrued to the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semiannual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the applicable Treasury Yield plus 50 basis points, plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any to the Redemption Date.\nCIT has instructed Wilmington Trust, National Association, as the trustee for the 3.875% Notes, and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as the trustee for the 5.500% Notes, to distribute a Notice of Redemption to all registered holders of the applicable Notes on March 9, 2018.

The words \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"forecast,\" \"initiative,\" \"objective,\" \"plan,\" \"goal,\" \"project,\" \"outlook,\" \"priorities,\" \"target,\" \"intend,\" \"evaluate,\" \"pursue,\" \"commence,\" \"seek,\" \"may,\" \"would,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"believe,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" or the negative of any of those words or similar expressions is intended to identify forward-looking statements. All statements contained in this press release, other than statements of historical fact, including without limitation, statements about our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations regarding future events and our financial performance, are forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. While these statements represent our current judgment on what the future may hold, and we believe these judgments are reasonable, these statements are not guarantees of any events or financial results, and our actual results may differ materially. Important factors that could cause our actual results to be materially different from our expectations include, among others, the risk that (i) CIT is unsuccessful in implementing its strategy and business plan, (ii) CIT is unable to react to and address key business and regulatory issues, (iii) CIT is unable to achieve the projected revenue growth from its new business initiatives or the projected expense reductions from efficiency improvements, (iv) CIT becomes subject to liquidity constraints and higher funding costs, or (v) the parties to a transaction do not receive or satisfy regulatory or other approvals or conditions on a timely basis or approvals are subject to conditions that are not anticipated. We describe these and other risks that could affect our results in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" of our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements contained in this press release.
