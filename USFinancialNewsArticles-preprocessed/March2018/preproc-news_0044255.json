Please refresh the page if you do not see a player above at that time.]\nWhite House principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah is scheduled to brief reporters on Monday, a day after \"60 Minutes\" aired an interview with adult-film actress and director Stormy Daniels in which she described her alleged relationship with Donald Trump .\nIt also follows a move to kick out dozens of Russian officers from the U.S.\nThe Trump administration joined more than a dozen European nations' actions against Russia on Monday morning by expelling 60 diplomats and closing the Russian consulate in Seattle . The U.S. and Britain blamed Russia for the attempted assassination of a former spy, who was poisoned with a rare nerve agent in March.\nThe retaliation against Russia followed President Donald Trump 's statements on Twitter last week, when he argued, \"Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.\"\nTrump tweet 1 \nTrump tweet 2 \nAfter imposing new tariffs on imports of Chinese goods last week, China promptly responded with trade restrictions of its own. The reciprocal trade barriers exacerbated the growing fears of a global trade war, particularly between China and the U.S.\nOn Monday, however, representatives from both countries expressed a desire to repair the strained trading relationship and avoid more punitive tariffs.\nThe press briefing will also be the first since Trump announced former UN ambassador John Bolton as a replacement for outgoing national security advisor Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster . Bolton, whose hawkish military views are well documented , will officially join the administration April 9.",
