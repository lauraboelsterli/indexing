Director General Kimmo Lahdevirta from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland reads out a press statement concerning the meeting on Northeast Asian issues at the Konigstedt Manor, in Vantaa, Finland March 21, 2018. Lehtikuva/Markku Ulander via REUTERS Some 18 delegates from the three countries, including Choe Kang Il, a deputy director general for North American affairs at North Korea’s foreign ministry, came to Finland earlier this week for a “track 2” conference amid a series of diplomatic encounters ahead of a possible U.S.-North Korean summit. “This meeting was one of a series of academic sessions over many years that have explored approaches to building confidence and reducing tensions on the Korean Peninsula,” Director General Kimmo Lahdevirta from the Finnish foreign ministry told reporters in front of a government manor out of town in which the delegates had been secluded for two days. “The participants had a constructive exchange of views in a positive atmosphere.” A convoy of black cars arrives to the Finnish government's Konigstedt Manor for the meeting between the U.S., North Korean and South Korean delegations, in Vantaa, Finland March 21, 2018.

Finnish Foreign Minister Timo Soini said on Tuesday that North Korea denuclearization was not on the table.
