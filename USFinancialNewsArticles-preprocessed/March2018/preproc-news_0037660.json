    "text": "March 21, 2018 / 7:42 AM / Updated 19 minutes ago Russia's Rosatom says committed to start Turkish Akkuyu plant in 2023   MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian state nuclear company Rosatom plans to launch the Akkuyu nuclear plant in Turkey in 2023, it told Reuters, adding that the talks with potential new investors are not expected to affect the construction timetable. “Rosatom categorically rejects speculation that any changes to the composition of the local ownership structure in the Akkuyu project have any bearing on the timetable of its implementation,” Rosatom said in a statement. “We are doing our utmost to speed up the first unit’s construction based on following the strictest safety regulations and the request of the Turkish Party to achieve physical start-up of the first unit of the NPP (nuclear plant) in 2023”.
