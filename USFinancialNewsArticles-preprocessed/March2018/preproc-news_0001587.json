    "text": "PARIS, Feb 28 (Reuters) - French state-controlled utility EDF will not be allowed to start up its new Flamanville nuclear reactor without regulator ASN’s approval of a solution to problems with substandard welding, the ASN said on Wednesday.\nLast week, EDF said more than half of the weldings on the reactor’s secondary cooling circuit did not meet required specifications.\nIt said that did not affect Flamanville’s safety or the schedule to load it with fuel at the end of 2018.\nAn ASN spokeswoman said the weldings problem could have an impact on the start-up calendar, however.\nEDF will have to present solutions in a report to the ASN, which will then seek input from experts in the second half of this year, she said.\nASN will then rule on whether the reactor is fit for service.\nThe spokeswoman said it seemed unlikely that ASN would receive a full report on the issue from EDF before the summer.\nReporting by Geert De Clercq; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
