LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • The SGX Nifty Futures were trading at 10,404.00, up 0.4 pct from its previous close. • The Indian rupee is expected to open higher against the dollar, buoyed by rebound in regional equities from the U.S. tariff-related selloff. • Indian government bonds are likely to edge lower in early session ahead of a heavy supply of state bonds. Higher U.S. Treasury yields will also weigh on demand, traders said. The yield on the 7.17 pct bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in 7.76 pct-7.82 pct band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • U.S. stocks rallied on Monday as fears of a global trade war ebbed with investors betting that U.S. President Donald Trump would back down on his threat to impose hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. • Asian shares regained some ground after U.S. President Donald Trump faced growing pressure from political allies to pull back from proposed steel and aluminium tariffs, easing investor worries about an imminent trade war. • The dollar edged higher versus the yen, supported by receding fears about a trade war stemming from U.S. resident Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminium. • Treasuries yields rose on Monday afternoon as the U.S. stock market recovered and fears of a trade war eased after senior Republicans urged US President Donald Trump to reconsider his threat to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. • Oil prices extended gains for the fifth straight day, underpinned by robust demand forecasts and prospects for informal contacts sought by OPEC with U.S. shale oil producers at a key industry meeting in Houston this week. • Gold prices edged up on a softer dollar, amid worries about a global trade war even as U.S. President Donald Trump faced pressure from political and trade allies over his plan for steel and aluminum tariffs.
