    "text": "March 29, 2018 / 12:39 PM / Updated 12 hours ago FACTBOX-Cricket-How the world reacted to Smith and Bancroft's apologies Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nMarch 29 (Reuters) - Reaction after deposed Australian captain Steve Smith and opening batsman Cameron Bancroft held news conferences in Australia to apologise for their roles in last week’s ball-tampering scandal in Cape Town. \nMATT PRIOR, former England wicketkeeper \n“Fair play Bancroft and Steve Smith taking it head on and fronting up. That was hard to watch and can’t imagine what they’re going through. People make mistakes but being able to own up and take responsibility takes guts.” \nHERSCHELLE GIBBS, former South Africa batsman \n“Hard scenes watching the interviews with the 2 ozzie (sic) blokes. Having been through it all, take it on the chin and live with the consequences but remain true to yourself.” \nMICHAEL VAUGHAN, former England captain \n“‘Good people make mistakes’.. I honestly think Steve Smith & Cam Bancroft are decent guys who had a moment of madness.. they deserve a 2nd chance and hopefully get the right support around them now .. Takes a lot guts to do what they did today.” \nMITCHELL JOHNSON, former Australia bowler \n“Tough to watch Cameron & Steve go through the 2 statements they just made. They will learn from this & be better in the future I’m sure!” \nMARK BUTCHER, former England batsman \n“Just watched Smith presser. Hope everybody has had their pound of flesh now.” \nKEVIN PIETERSEN, former England batsman \n“Just seen @stevesmith49’s press conference. As a parent, I’m gutted for him & his family! Shout me down if you want, but I’m speaking as a parent! It will get better mate!” \nMICHAEL CLARKE, former Australia captain “DEVASTATING!” \nHARSHA BHOGLE, Indian cricket commentator \n“Haven’t Australia made enough of a spectacle of Steve Smith? I’m blown by what he is being put through.” \nRYAN HARRIS, former Australia test bowler \n“So very hard to watch, well done Smithy and Bangas, horrible to see the pain they are in! They did wrong but will be back bigger and better! #goodyoungmen” \nMOHAMMAD KAIF, former India batsman \n“Feel the pain he (Smith) is going through. Waiting for him to come back soon and cause delight to fans across the world with his supreme batsmanship. Remember Warne served a 1 year ban for a banned substance and came back with 26 wkts in 3 tests against SL.” (Compiled by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru, editing by Pritha Sarkar)",
