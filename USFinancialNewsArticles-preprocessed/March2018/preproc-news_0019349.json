    "text": "DARMSTADT, Germany (Reuters) - German drugs and chemicals group Merck KGaA ( MRCG.DE ) is open to sharing development costs for its mid-stage pharmaceuticals pipeline with external partners, it said on Thursday after flagging a decline in earnings this year.\n“We are very open to partnerships ... we are in talks with many players,” Chief Executive Stefan Oschmann told a news conference after the release of fourth-quarter results, pointing in particular to evobrutinib, a so-called BTK inhibitor that suppresses autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.\n“We have a full, very good pipeline and we have to see how we can finance the development of this pipeline so that it is not a burden on our financial results.”\nMerck earlier flagged a fall in operating profit this year, citing Chinese competition in liquid crystals used in flat screens and higher drug development expenses, prompting a more than 5 percent drop in its share price.\nThe planned sale of its consumer healthcare unit, with proceeds earmarked to fund development work, has hit a snag after sources said that Nestle ( NESN.S ) dropped out of the bidding and prices proposed by remaining suitors fell short of Merck’s expectations.\nOther experimental drugs from Merck’s labs that analysts have described as promising include an immuno-oncology drug known as bifunctional fusion protein as well as oral cancer drug tepotinib.\nReporting by Ludwig Burger; Editing by David Goodman\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
