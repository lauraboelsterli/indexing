    "text": "JAKARTA, March 9 (Reuters) - Indonesia’s central bank expects the country’s current account deficit to widen this year, but no larger than 2.1 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), Governor Agus Martowardojo said on Friday.\nIt is near the lower end of the central bank’s previous estimate of 2 percent-2.5 percent of GDP for this year.\nMartowardojo said he expected the deficit to widen from last year’s 1.7 percent due to higher imports of capital goods, and that trade balance would post a deficit of $230 million in February.
