    "text": "GAINESVILLE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Exactech, a developer and producer of bone and joint restoration products and biologic solutions for extremities, knee and hip announced today it has received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market the Novation XLE Vitamin E acetabular polyethylene liners for hip replacement surgery. These liners are designed to work in conjunction with the Novation® Crown Cup® Acetabular System including InteGrip® printed, 3-D porous material.\nThe advanced bearing material in the new XLE liners is designed for low wear and contains vitamin E. Oxidation in-vivo can contribute to polyethylene degradation in orthopaedic implant polyethylene. Vitamin E, a natural antioxidant, is blended into the raw material of Novation XLE liners to mitigate oxidative effects both before and after implantation.\nThis product complements Exactech’s Hip product family, which also includes the Alteon® HA Femoral Stem , Tapered Wedge Femoral Stem , Neck Preserving Stem and Monobloc Revision Stem .\nAbout Exactech\nBased in Gainesville, Fla., Exactech develops and markets orthopaedic implant devices, related surgical instruments and biologic materials and services to hospitals and physicians.
