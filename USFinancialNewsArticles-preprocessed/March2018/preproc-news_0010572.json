    "text": "GERMANTOWN, Md., Orgenesis Inc. (OTCQB:ORGS), a leading manufacturer, service provider and developer of advanced cell therapies , today reported financial results and provided a business update for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ending November 30, 2017.\nVered Caplan, Chief Executive Officer, commented, “2017 was a transformational year for Orgenesis. First, we are experiencing rapid revenue growth, as illustrated by the fact our full year sales increased by 58% to over $10 million. For the fourth quarter alone, sales increased by 78%. We attribute this growth to the increase in our customer base, which includes many of the world’s leading pharmaceutical and biotech companies, such as Servier and CRISPR. As a leading CDMO in the cell therapy field, we offer a compelling value proposition for our customers through a scalable, highly-efficient, commercial manufacturing platform. This outsourced manufacturing capability reduces costs and time-to-market for our customers. At the same time, there is a lack of sufficient GMP manufacturing capacities across the industry. Our ability to support customers from early clinical trials to commercial manufacturing provides us excellent visibility into our future revenue growth through long-term collaboration agreements as our customers advance through clinical development and into commercialization.”\n“We are also pleased to report we are now generating positive gross profit and achieved gross margins of 43.5% for the fourth quarter of 2017. This further illustrates the scalability of our business model and earnings potential as we continue to grow revenue. Overall, the cell therapy market is in a period of unprecedented growth and is expected reach $60 billion by 2020. Our CDMO, MaSTherCell, is uniquely positioned to support the global development and commercialization needs of these companies due to our advanced manufacturing capabilities and unmatched international reach.”\n“Lastly, we continue to advance our proprietary and patented trans-differentiation platform technology, whereby an adult cell is converted into another type of cell with distinct phenotype and function. This technology does not use stem cells, but rather offers a much more targeted approach using fully mature, adult cells. This not only reduces the risk of cell mutation or malignancy, but also allows for the testing of cells ex-vivo before insertion. Initially, we remain focused on our first indication – development of Autologous Insulin Producing ('AIP') cells. By transforming the patient’s own liver cell into a fully-functional and physiologically glucose-responsive insulin-producing cell, we believe we can provide patients, such as those with insulin-dependent diabetes, with long-term insulin independence. However, it is important to note that our platform technology has potential across a number of other indications, and we look forward to providing further updates.”\nFinancial Results\nRevenue for the three months ended November 30, 2017 increased 78.1% to $3.4 million, as compared to $1.9 million for the three months ended November 30, 2016.

Through its Israeli subsidiary, Orgenesis Ltd., Orgenesis is a pioneer in the development of technology designed to successfully reprogram human liver cells into glucose-responsive, fully functional, Insulin Producing Cells (IPCs). Orgenesis believes that converting the diabetic patient's own tissue into insulin-producing cells has the potential to overcome the significant issues of donor shortage, cost and exposure to chronic immunosuppressive therapy associated with islet cell transplantation. Through its Belgian subsidiary, MaSTherCell S.A., a global Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO), Orgenesis is able to deliver optimized process industrialization capacities to cell therapy organizations and speed up the arrival of their therapies onto the market. From technology selection to business modeling, GMP manufacturing, process development, quality management and assay development, MaSTherCell’s teams are fully committed to helping their clients fulfill their objective of providing sustainable and affordable therapies to their patients. MaSTherCell operates in a validated and flexible facility located in the strategic center of Europe within the Walloon healthcare cluster, Biowin.
