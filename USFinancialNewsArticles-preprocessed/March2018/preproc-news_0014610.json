Our focus on staying close to our customer, executing to our playbook and maintaining our disciplined approach to expense management delivered a strong performance on both the top and bottom line.\nOverall, 2017 was a year of significant progress.

For the quarter, expense reductions were more than offset by the impact of the additional week, volume-related expenses from higher sales and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nMarketing, general and administrative expense was $128.1 million, up from $121.7 million last year. Excluding legal charges of $4.0 million, adjusted non-GAAP marketing, general and administrative expense increased $2.4 million, as expense reductions were more than offset by higher performance-based compensation expense.\nAsset impairment was $4.0 million.\nNet other operating income was $12.4 million, which included net foreign currency gains of $6.8 million and gift card breakage of $4.4 million, compared to $9.4 million last year.\nOperating income was $140.3 million, compared to $61.3 million last year.

For the full year, expense reductions more than offset the impact of the additional week, volume-related expense from higher comparable sales and changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nMarketing, general and administrative expense was $471.9 million, up from $453.2 million last year. Excluding legal charges of $15.1 million this year and indemnification recovery benefits of $6.0 million last year, adjusted non-GAAP marketing, general and administrative expense decreased $2.4 million, as expense reductions more than offset higher performance-based compensation and marketing expenses.\nAsset impairment was $14.4 million, compared to $7.9 million last year.\nNet other operating income was $16.9 million, which included net foreign currency gains of $7.0 million and gift card breakage of $6.4 million, compared to $26.2 million last year.

Excluding certain items, adjusted non-GAAP operating income was $100.8 million, compared to $3.3 million last year.\nThe effective tax rate was 81%, reflecting discrete net tax charges of $19.9 million related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, primarily associated with the one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings, and discrete non-cash tax charges of $10.6 million related to a change in share-based compensation accounting standards. Excluding tax charges of $19.9 million and the tax effect of certain other items, the adjusted non-GAAP effective tax rate was 42%.\nNet income attributable to Abercrombie & Fitch Co. was $7.1 million, compared to $4.0 million last year. Excluding certain items, adjusted non-GAAP net income attributable to Abercrombie & Fitch Co. was $45.0 million, compared to adjusted non-GAAP net loss attributable to Abercrombie & Fitch Co. of $4.1 million last year.\nCash, Inventory and Borrowings\nThe company ended the fiscal year with $675.6 million in cash and cash equivalents, and gross borrowings under the company's term loan agreement of $253.3 million, compared to $547.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and $268.3 million of gross borrowings last year.\nThe company ended the fiscal year with $424.4 million in inventory, an increase of 6% over last year.\nCapital Expenditures and Store Activity\nTotal capital expenditures for the full year were $107.0 million, which consisted of $62.7 million related to store updates and new stores and $44.3 million related to direct-to-consumer and omnichannel, information technology and other projects.\nDuring the year, the company opened nine new stores, including six U.S. and one international full-price stores and two outlet stores. The company also closed 39 stores, primarily in the U.S.\nOther Developments\nAs previously announced, on February 23, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share on the Class A Common Stock of Abercrombie & Fitch Co., payable on March 19, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on March 9, 2018.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“the Act”) was signed into law making broad and significantly complex changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the company recognized provisional discrete net tax charges of $19.9 million related to the enactment of the Act, primarily associated with the one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings. Given the complexities associated with the Act, the estimated financial impacts for fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2017 are provisional and subject to further analysis, interpretation and clarification of the Act, which could result in changes to these estimates during fiscal 2018.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\nFor fiscal 2018, the company expects:\nComparable sales to be up low-single digits\nNet sales to be up low-single digits, with benefits from changes in foreign currency exchange rates largely offset by the adverse impact from the loss of fiscal 2017's additional week\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates to benefit net sales by approximately $50 million and operating income by approximately $15 million, net of hedging\nA gross profit rate up slightly from the fiscal 2017 rate of 59.7%, with some continuing pressure in the first quarter\nOperating expenses, excluding other operating income, to be up approximately 1% from fiscal 2017 adjusted non-GAAP operating expense of $2 billion, resulting in expense leverage, while supporting significant incremental investments in strategic initiatives\nOther operating income to not be significant, including as a result of gift card breakage now being recognized within net sales due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standards\nA weighted average diluted share count of approximately 71 million shares, excluding the effect of potential share buybacks\nThe company estimates its core tax rate to be in the mid to high 20s based on the Act. However, for fiscal 2018, the company expects to incur discrete non-cash income tax charges of approximately $10 million related to share-based compensation accounting standards that went into effect in fiscal 2017. As a result, the company expects the full year effective tax rate to be in the mid-to-high 30s. For the first quarter, the company expects the effective tax rate to be in the low-double digits to low teens, reflecting approximately $9 million of the discrete non-cash income tax charges related to share-based compensation.\nThe company is targeting capital expenditures to be approximately $130 million for fiscal 2018. Capital expenditures are expected to include approximately $85 million for store updates and new stores and approximately $45 million for direct-to-consumer and omnichannel investments, information technology and other projects.\nThe company plans to open 21 full-price stores in fiscal 2018, including 11 in the U.S. and 10 in international markets. In addition, the company anticipates closing up to 60 stores in the U.S. during the fiscal year through natural lease expirations.\nConference Call\nToday at 8:30 AM, EST, the company will conduct a conference call.

Management used these non-GAAP financial measures during the periods presented to assess the company's performance, to make decisions about how to allocate resources and to develop expectations for future operating performance. The company provides certain financial information on a constant currency basis to enhance investors' understanding of underlying business trends and operating performance. The effect from foreign currency, calculated on a constant currency basis, is determined by applying current period exchange rates to prior year results and is net of the year-over-year impact from hedging. The per diluted share effect from foreign currency is calculated using a 35% tax rate. In addition, the company provides comparable sales which is defined as the aggregate of: (1) year-over-year sales for stores that have been open as the same brand at least one year and whose square footage has not been expanded or reduced by more than 20% within the past year, with prior year’s net sales converted at the current year’s foreign currency exchange rate to remove the impact of currency fluctuation, and (2) year-over-year direct-to-consumer sales with prior year’s net sales converted at the current year’s foreign currency exchange rate to remove the impact of currency fluctuation. Non-GAAP financial measures should be used supplemental to, not as an alternative to, the company's GAAP financial results, and may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.\nAbercrombie & Fitch Co.
