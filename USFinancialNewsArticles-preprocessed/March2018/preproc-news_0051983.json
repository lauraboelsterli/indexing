Your chance of winning? Roughly 1 in 50,000.\nRead more from USA TODAY:\nMega Millions climbs to $502 million after no winner chosen\nFacebook changes its privacy setting: What you need to know\nKrispy Kreme is serving up the iconic 'Simpsons' d'ohnut\nThe company said in a statement that there are \"no strings attached.'' Rather it's a way to get people to actually open Valpak's signature blue envelopes and check out the coupons inside.\nValpak says that it's offered the $100 checks since 1988, but typically only in certain markets. This is the first time the financial bonuses are popping up in each of the 150 markets that Valpak serves, all at the same time.",
