    "text": "HOUSTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Venezuelan PDVSA’s refineries will operate at 43 percent of their total capacity in March due to a lack of spare parts, light crude and feedstock, according to an internal document from the state-run firm seen by Reuters on Wednesday.\nThe company’s domestic refining network, which also includes a refinery in Curacao, plans to process 701,000 bpd of Venezuelan and imported crude next month, a slight increase versus an average of 660,000 bpd in March last year, but low compared to total installed capacity of 1.62 million bpd.
