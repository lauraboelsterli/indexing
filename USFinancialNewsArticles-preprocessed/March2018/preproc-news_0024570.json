For more information and a reconciliation of CAD, NOI and same store NOI to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, please refer to the tables on the following pages.\nMahbod Nia, Chief Executive Officer and President, commented, \"We are pleased to report another productive year in which we successfully leased or renewed over 16% of our portfolio and completed a number of value enhancing initiatives that contributed to an uplift in NAV of over $2 per share.\"\nMr. Nia continued: \"We have a highly capable team with extensive knowledge and expertise in the industry as evidenced by our track record of successfully acquiring, managing and exiting investments across Europe. This quarter, we have prepared a supplementary presentation summarizing our operational achievements to date.\"\nPortfolio Overview\n$2.3 billion portfolio market value 3 (\"Portfolio Market Value\") comprising $2.3 billion real estate portfolio value based on the 2017 independent year-end valuation by Cushman & Wakefield LLP and a $35 million preferred equity investment.\nReal Estate Portfolio Leasing Activity 4,5\nAs of December 31, 2017, NRE's real estate portfolio included 25 properties located across five European countries with approximately 323,000 rentable square meters, 86% weighted average occupancy and a 6.4 year weighted average remaining lease term to expiry (\"WALT\").\nThe office portfolio is comprised of 20 properties with 246,000 rentable square meters and has a 96% weighted average occupancy and a 6.4 year WALT as of December 31, 2017. The non-office portfolio includes 5 properties representing 4% of the fourth quarter 2017 portfolio NOI with 77,000 rentable square meters (including a 59,000 rentable square meters logistics asset) and has a 55% weighted average occupancy and a 5.6 year WALT as of December 31, 2017.\nSame Store Net Operating Income\nIn the fourth quarter 2017, same store sequential quarter-over-quarter rental income increased by $0.7 million, or 2.7%, driven by recent leasing activity including Deutsche Bundesbank commencing occupation in the Trianon Tower (full occupation as of January 2018). In the fourth quarter 2017, same store sequential quarter-over-quarter NOI increased by $0.2 million, or 0.7%. Fourth quarter 2017 same store NOI included a $0.9 million write-off of straight-line rent (included in Properties - operating expenses) related to an early tenant termination at Portman Square in connection with the expansion of Invesco's occupancy.\nSame store portfolio year-over-year rental income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased by $1.3 million, or 5.4%, and same store year-over-year NOI increased by $1.1 million, or 4.7%, primarily as a result of the 2017 leasing activity and rent reviews completed during the year, partially offset by a $0.9 million write-off of straight-line rent (included in Properties - operating expenses) related to an early tenant termination at Portman Square.\nIn 2017, NRE signed 50,000 rentable square meters (16% of the portfolio) of new leases or lease renewals, which are expected to add approximately $3 million per year to same store NOI in 2018 (compared to the fourth quarter 2017) as the leases commence.\nDispositions\nIn 2017, NRE sold six properties for $138 million. As of December 31, 2017, two properties, Office 123 located in Portugal and Maastoren located in the Netherlands, were classified as held-for-sale.\nIn February 2018, NRE signed a definitive sale and purchase agreement to sell the Maastoren property, NRE's largest non-core asset, for approximately $190 million, slightly above the independent year-end valuation and at a 20% premium to the independent mid-year valuation preceding lease extensions completed in the second half of 2017. NRE expects to release approximately $60 million of net equity after repayment of financing (including release premium) and transaction costs. The closing is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.\nCash Expense Savings\nManagement has commenced implementation of cost saving initiatives that are expected to result in approximately $4-5 million per annum ($0.07 - $0.09 per share) of net run rate savings in other expenses and general and administrative expenses from the end of 2018, related to the internalization of certain asset management, accounting and other services and a reduction of corporate costs. Other expenses and CAD for the three months ended December 31, 2017 include approximately $0.9 million of one-time termination costs related to certain service providers.\nLiquidity and Financing\nAs of December 31, 2017, leverage was 52.3% based on the Portfolio Market Value, down from 56.2% as of December 31, 2016 6 .\nIn March 2018, NRE amended its revolving credit facility with Bank of America Merrill Lynch through a new commitment provided by Deutsche Bank AG New York, increasing the size to $70 million and extending the term until April 2020 with a one year extension option. The facility includes an accordion feature, providing for the ability to increase the facility to $105 million.\nAs of March 9, 2018, total liquidity was $132 million, comprised of $62 million of unrestricted cash and $70 million of availability under NRE's revolving credit facility. The following table presents our liquidity (dollars in millions):\nMarch 9, 2018\nUnrestricted cash\n$\n62\nRevolving credit facility\n70\nTotal liquidity\n$\n132\nExpected proceeds from Maastoren sale\n60\nTotal potential liquidity\n$\n192\nStockholder's Equity\nNRE had 55.8 million shares of common stock, operating partnership units and restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") not subject to performance hurdles outstanding as of December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2017, total equity was $624 million (U.S. GAAP depreciated value), or $11.18 per diluted share. EPRA net asset value, or EPRA NAV, was $19.85 per diluted share as of December 31, 2017, based on the Portfolio Market Value compared to $17.77 per share as of September 30, 2017. For more information and a reconciliation of EPRA NAV to total equity, please refer to the tables on the following pages.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn March 12, 2018, the board of directors (the \"Board\") of NRE authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of its outstanding common stock. The repurchases will occur from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions as market conditions permit. The authorization will expire in 12 months, unless otherwise extended by the Board. The repurchase program will be utilized at management's discretion and in accordance with the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

For the year ended December 31, 2017, compensation expense includes the impact of substantially all time based and certain performance based awards vesting in connection with the change of control of NRE's manager.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIncluded in this press release are Cash Available for Distribution, or CAD, net operating income, or NOI, same store net operating income, or same store NOI, and EPRA net asset value, or EPRA NAV, each a \"non-GAAP financial measure,\" which measures NRE's historical or future financial performance that is different from measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, within the meaning of the applicable Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, rules. NRE believes these metrics can be a useful measure of its performance which is further defined below.\nCash Available for Distribution\nWe believe that CAD provides investors and management with a meaningful indicator of operating performance. We also believe that CAD is useful because it adjusts for a variety of items that are consistent with presenting a measure of operating performance (such as transaction costs, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, realized gain (loss) on sales and other, asset impairment and non-recurring bad debt expense). We adjust for transaction costs because these costs are not a meaningful indicator of our operating performance. For instance, these transaction costs include costs such as professional fees associated with new investments, which are expenses related to specific transactions. Management also believes that quarterly distributions are principally based on operating performance and our board of directors includes CAD as one of several metrics it reviews to determine quarterly distributions to stockholders. The definition of CAD may be adjusted from time to time for our reporting purposes in our discretion, acting through our audit committee or otherwise. CAD may fluctuate from period to period based upon a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the timing and amount of investments, repayments and asset sales, capital raised, use of leverage, changes in the expected yield of investments and the overall conditions in commercial real estate and the economy generally.\nWe calculate CAD by subtracting from or adding to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-controlling interests and the following items: depreciation and amortization items including straight-line rental income or expense (excluding amortization of rent free periods), amortization of above/below market leases, amortization of deferred financing costs, amortization of discount on financings and other and equity-based compensation; unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives and other; realized gain (loss) on sales and other (excluding any realized gain (loss) on foreign currency derivatives); impairment on depreciable property; non-recurring bad debt expense; acquisition gains or losses; transaction costs; foreign currency gains (losses); impairment on goodwill and other intangible assets; and one-time events pursuant to changes in U.S. GAAP and certain other non-recurring items. These items, if applicable, include any adjustments for unconsolidated ventures.\nCAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance. In addition, our methodology for calculating CAD involves subjective judgment and discretion and may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies, including other REITs, when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of CAD to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet income (loss) attributable to common\nstockholders\n$\n1,442\n$\n13,859\n$\n(31,125)\n$\n(61,753)\nNon-controlling interests\n1,095\n43\n792\n(749)\nAdjustments:\nDepreciation and amortization items (1)(2)\n19,612\n22,609\n81,269\n93,913\nImpairment losses\n—\n—\n—\n27,468\nUnrealized (gain) loss on derivatives and other\n795\n(8,319)\n12,863\n11,257\nRealized (gain) loss on sales and other (3)(4)\n(14,444)\n(20,152)\n(21,388)\n(27,235)\nTransaction costs and other (5)(6)\n4,552\n1,884\n7,138\n9,217\nCAD\n$\n13,052\n$\n9,924\n$\n49,549\n$\n52,118\nCAD per share (7)\n$\n0.23\n$\n0.17\n$\n0.89\n$\n0.87\nThree months ended December 31, 2017 represents an adjustment to exclude depreciation and amortization of $14.5 million, amortization expense of capitalized above/below market leases of $0.9 million, amortization of deferred financing costs of $0.5 million and amortization of equity-based compensation of $3.7 million. Year ended December 31, 2017 represents an adjustment to exclude depreciation and amortization of $54.0 million, amortization of above/below market leases of $0.7 million, amortization of deferred financing costs of $2.8 million and amortization of equity-based compensation of $23.8 million. Three months December 31, 2016 represents an adjustment to exclude depreciation and amortization of $13.7 million, amortization of above/below market leases of $0.3 million, amortization of deferred financing costs of $1.6 million and amortization of equity-based compensation of $7.0 million. Year ended December 31, 2016 represents an adjustment to exclude depreciation and amortization of $65.0 million, amortization of above/below market leases of $2.6 million, amortization of deferred financing costs of $7.1 million and amortization of equity-based compensation of $19.3 million. Three months ended December 31, 2017 CAD includes a $(0.7) million net loss related to the settlement of foreign currency derivatives. Year ended December 31, 2017 CAD includes a $1.0 million net gain related to the settlement of foreign currency derivatives. Three months ended December 31, 2016 CAD includes a $0.3 million net gain related to the settlement of foreign currency derivatives. Year ended December 31, 2016 CAD includes a $(0.8) million net loss related to the settlement of foreign currency derivatives. Three months ended December 31, 2017 represents an adjustment to exclude $4.6 million of transaction costs. Year ended December 31, 2017 represents an adjustment to exclude $6.1 million of transaction costs and $1.0 million of payroll taxes associated with the acceleration of equity awards due to the tri-party merger completed on January 10, 2017, between NRE's external manager, NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc., NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. and Colony Capital, Inc. Three months December 31, 2016 represents an adjustment to exclude $0.9 million of non-recurring bad debt expense and $1.0 million of taxes associated with the capital gain tax on the sale of real estate investments. Year ended December 31, 2016 represents an adjustment to exclude $2.6 million of transaction costs, $1.3 million of non-recurring bad debt expense and $5.3 million of taxes associated with the capital gain tax on the sale of real estate investments. CAD per share is based on 55.8 million and 55.9 million weighted average shares (common shares outstanding including operating partnership units and RSUs not subject to performance hurdles) for the the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively. Based on 57.1 million weighted average shares (common shares outstanding, including LTIPs and RSUs not subject to performance hurdles) for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 60.0 million weighted average shares (common shares outstanding, including LTIPs and RSUs not subject to performance hurdles) for the year ended December 31, 2016. CAD per share does not take into account any potential dilution from restricted stock units subject to performance metrics not currently achieved.\nNet Operating Income\nWe believe NOI is a useful metric of the operating performance of our real estate portfolio in the aggregate. Portfolio results and performance metrics represent 100% for all consolidated investments. Net operating income represents total property and related revenues, adjusted for: (i) amortization of above/below market leases; (ii) straight-line rent (except with respect to rent free period); (iii) other items such as adjustments related to joint ventures and non-recurring bad debt expense and less property operating expenses. However, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, transaction costs, depreciation and amortization expense, realized gains (losses) on sales and other and other items under U.S. GAAP and capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of properties, all of which may be significant economic costs. NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of U.S. GAAP net income (loss) which further limits its usefulness.\nNOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance. In addition, our methodology for calculating NOI involves subjective judgment and discretion and may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies, including other REITs, when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of NOI of our real estate equity and preferred equity segments to property and other related revenues less property operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nRental income\n$\n26,041\n$\n25,700\n$\n105,349\n$\n124,321\nEscalation income\n5,265\n5,347\n21,625\n25,173\nOther income\n535\n823\n1,243\n1,721\nTotal property and other income\n31,841\n31,870\n128,217\n151,215\nProperties - operating expenses\n8,598\n8,628\n31,119\n35,892\nAdjustments:\nInterest income\n705\n—\n1,706\n—\nAmortization and other items (1)(2)\n922\n691\n666\n3,756\nNOI\n$\n24,870\n$\n23,933\n$\n99,470\n$\n119,079\nThree months ended December 31, 2017 primarily excludes $0.9 million of amortization of above/below market leases. Year ended December 31, 2017 primarily includes $0.7 million of amortization of above/below market leases. Three months ended December 31, 2016 primarily excludes $0.9 million of non-recurring bad debt expense offset by $(0.2) million of amortization of above/below market rent. Year ended December 31, 2016 primarily includes $2.6 million of amortization of above/below market leases and $1.3 million of non-recurring bad debt expense.

Same store net operating income is presented for the same store portfolio, which represents all properties that were owned by us at the end of the reporting period. We define same store net operating income as NOI excluding (i) properties that were acquired or sold during the period, (ii) impact of foreign currency changes and (iii) amortization of above/below market leases. We consider same store NOI to be an appropriate and useful supplemental performance measure. Same store NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance. In addition, our methodology for calculating same store net operating income involves subjective judgment and discretion and may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies, including other REITs, when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies. Same store portfolio is defined as properties in operation throughout the full periods presented under the comparison, excluding the impact of foreign currency changes, and included 25 properties.\nThe following table presents our same store analysis for the real estate equity segment which represents 25 properties (323,230 rentable square meters) and excludes properties that were acquired or sold at any time during the three months ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 (dollars in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nIncrease (Decrease)\nDecember 31, 2017\nSeptember 30, 2017 (1)\nAmount\nPercentage\nOccupancy (end of period)\n86.1 %\n84.6 %\nSame store\nRental income (2)\n$\n26,159\n$\n25,473\n$\n686\n2.7 %\nEscalation income\n5,143\n4,705\n438\nOther income\n535\n177\n358\nTotal revenues\n31,837\n30,355\n1,482\n4.9 %\nUtilities\n2,240\n1,797\n443\nReal estate taxes and insurance\n1,188\n1,330\n(142)\nManagement fees\n512\n494\n18\nRepairs and maintenance\n2,531\n2,148\n383\nGround rent (2)\n200\n194\n6\nStraight-line rent write-off\n850\n—\n850\nOther\n500\n744\n(244)\nProperties - operating expenses\n8,021\n6,707\n1,314\n19.6 %\nSame store NOI\n$\n23,816\n$\n23,648\n$\n168\n0.7 %\nThree months ended September 30, 2017 is translated using the average exchange rate for the three months ended December 31, 2017.

Our calculation of EPRA NAV is derived from our U.S. GAAP balance sheet with adjustments reflecting our interpretation of EPRA's best practices recommendations. Accordingly, our calculation of EPRA NAV may be different from how other European real estate companies calculate EPRA NAV, which utilize International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\") to prepare their balance sheet. EPRA NAV makes adjustments to net assets as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP in order to provide our stockholders a measure of fair value of our assets and liabilities with a long-term investment strategy. This performance measure excludes assets and liabilities that are not expected to materialize in normal circumstances. EPRA NAV includes the revaluation of investment properties and excludes the fair value of financial instruments that we intend to hold to maturity, deferred tax and goodwill that resulted from deferred tax. All other assets, including real property and investments reported at cost are adjusted to fair value based upon an independent third party valuation conducted in December and June of each year. This measure should not be considered as an alternative to measuring our net assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of EPRA NAV to total equity as at December 31, 2017 (dollars in thousands, other than per share data):\nDecember 31, 2017\nTotal Equity\n$\n624,345\nAdjustments\nOperating real estate and net intangibles\n(1,765,521)\nFair value of properties\n2,258,638\nAdjusted NAV\n1,115,041\nDiluted NAV, after the exercise of options,\nconvertibles and other equity interests\n1,115,041\nFair value of financial instruments\n(7,024)\nEPRA NAV\n1,108,017\nEPRA NAV per diluted share (1)\n$\n19.85",
