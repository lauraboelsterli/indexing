    "text": "SAN DIEGO, March 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Turtle Beach Corporation (NASDAQ: HEAR), a leading gaming headset and audio accessory company, reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter Summary vs. Year-Ago Quarter:\nNet revenue of $79.7 million versus $82.2 million, down slightly due to channel inventory reductions. Gross margin up 90 basis points to a record 37.6%. Operating expenses were reduced by 6% to $14.0 million. Net income up 17% to a record $14.2 million, or $0.29 per share, compared to $12.2 million, or $0.25 per share. Adjusted EBITDA up 7% to a record $17.2 million. Leverage ratio declined to 2.1x versus 7.4x.\n2017 Summary vs. 2016:\nNet revenue of $149.1 million versus $174.0 million, down due to channel inventory reductions and under-ordering by several retailers. Gross margin up 970 basis points to a record 34.2%. Operating expenses were reduced 18% to $46.2 million from $56.4 million (excluding $63.9 million in HyperSound impairment and restructuring charges in 2016). Net loss improved significantly to $3.2 million, or $(0.07) per share, compared to a net loss of $87.2 million, or $(1.79) per share. Nearly tripled adjusted EBITDA, reporting $11.6 million versus $4.0 million.\n\"As reported in February, we experienced strong sales of Turtle Beach headsets in the fourth quarter, which helped drive our leading market share higher,\" said Juergen Stark, CEO, Turtle Beach. \"Healthy consumer demand and retailer restocking early in the first quarter of 2018 has more than closed a $6-7 million sales shortfall compared to our 2017 outlook, caused by cautious retail ordering in the fourth quarter.\n\"In fact, NPD data shows we are outpacing a very strong market in the first quarter, with North American console gaming headset sell-through in January up 61% on a revenue basis and Turtle Beach up 79%. We believe this is being driven by the blockbuster Fortnite and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds releases that are fueling strong headset sales, as well as an overall robust gaming market.\n\"Underlying our strong sales performance were market share gains in both North America and the U.K., which we believe show Turtle Beach continues to be the undisputed market leader in gaming headsets—a position we have held for eight years in a row. As we look to 2018, we intend to leverage this leadership position by continuing to develop our growing eSports presence and laying the groundwork for future growth in the $1.1 billion gaming peripherals market.\n\"Looking to 2018, having met our goal of significantly increasing adjusted EBITDA and earnings in 2017, we believe Turtle Beach is well-positioned to make selective investments to drive future growth. Given today's announcement regarding the improvements to our financing agreements, we are also expecting to lower our debt-related expenses and increase our financial flexibility.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nNet revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $79.7 million compared to $82.2 million in the year-ago quarter. The decline was largely due to under-ordering by several retailers in December, which was more than covered by restocking orders in January 2018.\nGross margin in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 90 basis points to a record 37.6% compared to 36.7% in the 2016 period. This is the Company's highest level of gross margin for any fourth quarter since becoming public in 2014. The increase was due to a mix-shift toward higher margin headsets, as well as on-going supply chain and logistics-driven product cost improvements.\nOperating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were reduced by 6% to $14.0 million compared to $14.9 million in the 2016 period due to a continued focus on cost management across the business.\nNet income in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 17% to a record $14.2 million, or $0.29 per diluted share, compared to $12.2 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, in the 2016 period. This is the Company's highest level of net income for any quarter since becoming public in 2014. The improvement was primarily driven by the higher gross margin and lower operating expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA (as defined below in \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\") in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 7% to $17.2 million compared to $16.1 million in the year-ago quarter. This is the Company's highest level of quarterly adjusted EBITDA since becoming public in 2014.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nNet revenue in 2017 was $149.1 million compared to $174.0 million in 2016. A significant portion of the revenue decline was driven by channel inventory reductions in 2017 and under-ordering by several retailers this past December that was more than covered by restocking orders in January 2018.\nGross margin in 2017 improved 970 basis points to 34.2% from 24.5% in 2016. This is the Company's highest level of annual gross margin since becoming public in 2014. The increase was due to the higher margin headset mix-shift and supply chain and logistics-driven product cost improvements, as well as the transition of HyperSound to a license model.\nOperating expenses in 2017 declined significantly to $46.2 million compared to $120.3 million in 2016. The decline was primarily driven by HyperSound impairment charges in 2016 of $63.2 million that did not reoccur, as well as continued cost management across the business. Excluding HyperSound-related impairment and restructuring charges, operating expenses in 2016 were $56.4 million.\nNet loss in 2017 improved significantly to $3.2 million, or $(0.07) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $87.2 million, or $(1.79) per diluted share in 2016, which included the HyperSound-related impairment and restructuring charges.\nAdjusted EBITDA (as defined below in \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\") was up significantly in 2017 to $11.6 million compared to $4.0 million in 2016. This is the highest level of adjusted EBITDA the company has reported since becoming public in 2014.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $5.2 million of cash and cash equivalents, compared to $6.2 million one year ago. As a result of its borrowings under a $60 million revolving credit facility, Turtle Beach generally does not hold a large cash balance.\nTotal outstanding debt principal at December 31, 2017, was $72.1 million compared to $69.7 million at December 31, 2016. The debt consisted of $38.5 million of revolving debt, $21.9 million in subordinated debt, and $11.7 million in term loans. The Company's leverage ratio, defined as total term loans outstanding and average trailing twelve month revolving debt, divided by consolidated trailing twelve month adjusted EBITDA, improved significantly to 2.1x at December 31, 2017, compared to 7.4x one year ago.\nAs announced in a separate press release today, Turtle Beach has amended its financing agreements with its lenders. The improved terms and covenants include a reduction in the interest rate of the revolving credit facility and term loans, a reduction in the interest rate on the subordinated debt, the ability to use term loan funds to reduce the subordinated debt, the elimination of EBITDA coverage covenants on the term loans, and the extension of the loans to March 2023. The net effect of the changes is expected to be interest savings of at least $3.5 million over the next five years.\n2018 Outlook\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Turtle Beach expects net revenue to increase 102% to approximately $29 million compared to $14.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net loss for the first quarter of 2018 is expected to improve to approximately $0.12 per share compared to a loss of $0.20 per share in the 2017 period. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2018 is expected to improve to approximately $(1.5) million compared to $(6.2) million in the 2017 period.\nFor the full year 2018, Turtle Beach expects net revenue to increase 5% to approximately $157 million compared to $149.1 million in 2017. This mid-single-digit increase assumes the mix of quarterly revenues will be shifted earlier in the year (similar to 2016) and the slate of AAA console games to be released for holiday 2018 will not match the exceptionally strong retail sales seen in holiday 2017. Full details on the 2018 slate will be revealed throughout the year, including at the Electronic Entertainment Expo show in mid-June, and full-year industry expectations will be updated accordingly. Net loss in 2018 is expected to improve to approximately $0.03 per share based upon 49.4 million expected diluted shares outstanding. This is compared to a net loss of $0.07 per share in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA in 2018 is expected to improve to approximately $12 million and includes several million dollars of investments intended to drive future growth.\nA table summarizing this outlook has been provided at the end of this release.\nWith respect to the Company's adjusted EBITDA outlook for the first quarter and full year 2018, a reconciliation to its net loss outlook for the same periods has not been provided because of the variability, complexity, and lack of visibility with respect to certain reconciling items between adjusted EBITDA and net loss, including other income (expense), provision for income taxes and stock-based compensation. These items cannot be reasonably and accurately predicted without the investment of undue time, cost and other resources and, accordingly, a reconciliation of the Company's adjusted EBITDA outlook to its net loss outlook for such periods is not available without unreasonable effort. These reconciling items could be material to the Company's actual results for such periods.\nConference Call Details\nTurtle Beach Corporation will hold a conference call today, March 6, 2018, at 2:00 p.m. Pacific time (5:00 p.m. Eastern) to discuss its fourth quarter and full year 2017 results.\nCEO Juergen Stark and CFO John Hanson will host the call, followed by a question and answer session.\nConference Call Details:\nDate: Tuesday, March 6, 2018\nTime: 5:00 p.m. ET / 2:00 p.m. PT\nToll-Free Dial-in Number: (877) 303-9855\nInternational Dial-in Number: (408) 337-0154\nConference ID: 3799958\nFor the conference call, please dial-in 5-10 minutes prior to the start time and an operator will register your name and organization.

See a reconciliation of GAAP results to adjusted EBITDA included below for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nAbout Turtle Beach Corporation\nTurtle Beach ( www.turtlebeach.com ) has been revolutionizing console multiplayer gaming since the very beginning with its wide selection of industry-leading, award-winning gaming headsets.
