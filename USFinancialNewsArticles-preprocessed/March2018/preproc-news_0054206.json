    "text": "WILMINGTON, Mass., March 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UniFirst Corporation (NYSE:UNF) today announced results for its second quarter which ended February 24, 2018. Revenues for the quarter were $419.3 million, up 7.1% from $391.4 million in the comparable prior year period. Income before income taxes for the quarter increased to $43.6 million from $37.4 million in the prior year period, or 16.6%.\nNet income in the quarter was $58.4 million ($2.85 per diluted share), compared to net income of $22.5 million ($1.10 per diluted share) in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company’s net income in the second quarter of 2018 was positively impacted by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Reform”) enacted on December 22, 2017, which resulted in a benefit to the Company’s provision for income taxes of $30.1 million. This benefit was largely due to a one-time revaluation of the Company’s U.S. net deferred tax liabilities. Excluding the impact of the Tax Reform, the Company’s net income for the quarter would have been $28.3 million ($1.38 per diluted share), an increase of 25.5% over the prior year period. See table for reconciliation to adjusted results.\nNet income excluding the impact of the Tax Reform benefited from $1.5 million of excess tax benefits from share-based payments associated with the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 (\"ASU 2016-09\"), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nSteve Sintros, UniFirst President and Chief Executive Officer said, “I am pleased with the results of the quarter and the first half of the year. I want to take this opportunity to thank our thousands of Team Partners across North America and Europe for their combined efforts in helping us achieve these results while continuing their primary focus of providing high quality products and services to our customers.”\nCore Laundry revenues in the quarter were $379.0 million, up 5.7% from the second quarter of the prior year. Organic revenue growth, which adjusts for the estimated effect of acquisitions as well as fluctuations in the Canadian dollar, was 5.0%. Core Laundry operating income was $38.1 million during the quarter, a 15.2% increase over the prior year period. The Core Laundry operating margin increased to 10.0% in the quarter, up from 9.2% for the same period a year ago. This margin expansion was primarily the result of lower merchandise costs and other production-related costs as a percentage of revenues as well as lower stock-based compensation expense compared to the second quarter a year ago. These favorable comparisons were partially offset by higher healthcare claims and administrative payroll costs as a percentage of revenues compared to the prior year.\nRevenues from our Specialty Garments segment, which consists of nuclear decontamination and cleanroom operations, were $27.0 million in the quarter, an increase of 24.0% compared to the same period a year ago. Operating income was $2.8 million compared to $2.1 million in last year’s second quarter. The year over year improvement was primarily due to increased outages and project-based activity at the segment’s Canadian and European nuclear customers, as well as solid growth from the cleanroom division. This segment’s results can vary significantly due to seasonality and the timing of reactor outages and projects.\nUniFirst continues to maintain a strong balance sheet with no long-term debt and significant cash balances. At the end of the Company's second quarter of fiscal 2018, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $387.7 million, an increase of $37.9 million since the end of fiscal 2017.\n$146.0 Million Share Repurchase and Quarterly Dividend Increase\nUniFirst also announced today that it repurchased 1.105 million shares of Class B Common Stock and 0.073 million shares of Common Stock for a combined $146.0 million in a private transaction with the Croatti family at a per share price of $124.00. In addition, UniFirst announced that it will be raising its quarterly dividend to $0.1125 per share for Common Stock and to $0.09 per share for Class B Common Stock, up from $0.0375 and $0.03 per share, respectively. Both of these decisions were reviewed and approved as part of the Board of Directors’ ongoing evaluation of UniFirst’s capital allocation strategy.\nMr. Sintros stated, “The Board of Directors determined that these actions would be beneficial to UniFirst and would not limit our ability to continue making the necessary investments that will allow us to grow and better service our customers which continue to be our top priorities. These actions also reflect the ongoing evaluation of opportunities that will provide value to our shareholders.”\nThis opportunity to repurchase shares from the Croatti family was evaluated by an independent special committee of the Board of Directors (the “Special Committee”). The sale of shares by the Croatti family was executed to provide liquidity as well as for estate and family financial planning following the passing of former UniFirst Chief Executive Officer, Ronald D. Croatti. The Special Committee determined that a repurchase of Croatti family Class B Common Stock at a discount to market was in the best interests of the Company as it is accretive to earnings per share and addresses uncertainties that may have been created if the Croatti family had pursued other liquidity options.\nThe Special Committee undertook its evaluation with the assistance of Stifel Financial Corp. (“Stifel”) and received an opinion from Stifel to the effect that, as of March 27, 2018, the $124.00 per share in cash to be paid was fair to the Company, from a financial point of view. The entire Board of Directors other than Cynthia Croatti, who is affiliated with the selling shareholders and therefore abstained, approved the transaction upon the recommendation of the Special Committee.\nMr. Sintros continued, “The willingness of the Company to deploy its available capital, together with the Croatti family’s desire for liquidity, aligned to create this opportunity to repurchase the Company’s stock at a price substantially discounted from market levels. Based on the Croatti family’s continued investment and involvement in UniFirst, they were highly motivated in ensuring that this was a positive transaction for the Company.”\nOutlook\nThe Company now expects that its fiscal 2018 revenues will be between $1.660 billion and $1.670 billion, which includes the benefit of a small acquisition the Company completed in the Memphis, TN market in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 that is anticipated to contribute approximately $5.0 million in additional revenue to fiscal 2018. In addition, this top-line outlook includes an increase of approximately $7.0 million related to our Specialty Garments business compared to our previously communicated guidance, due to the segment's strong second quarter performance as well as its revised forecast for the remainder of the year.\nFull year diluted earnings per share is now expected to be between $7.45 and $7.65. The revised diluted earnings per share guidance includes the impact of the Tax Reform as well as the $146.0 million share repurchase, which is anticipated to result in an estimated $0.15 increase to our 2018 earnings per share. This outlook assumes an effective tax rate for the second half of fiscal 2018 of 27.5% and does not include any further tax benefits related to the adoption of ASU 2016-09.\nConference Call Information\nUniFirst will hold a conference call today at 9:00 a.m. (ET) to discuss its quarterly financial results, business highlights and outlook.

To supplement these consolidated financial results, management believes that certain non-GAAP operating results provide a more meaningful measure on which to compare the Company’s results of operations for the periods presented. The Company believes these non-GAAP results provide useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance to both management and investors by excluding certain non-recurring amounts that impact the comparability of the results. Supplemental reconciliations of consolidated net income and earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis to adjusted net income and earnings per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis are presented in the following table. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, which are provided below.\n(In thousands, except per share data) Thirteen\nweeks ended\nFebruary 24,\n2018 Thirteen\nweeks ended\nFebruary 25,\n2017 Twenty-six\nweeks ended\nFebruary 24,\n2018 Twenty-six\nweeks ended\nFebruary 25,\n2017 GAAP Net income $ 58,378 $ 22,516 $ 92,584 $ 50,730 Effect of tax reform (30,110 ) — (30,110 ) — Non-GAAP Net income $ 28,268 $ 22,516 $ 62,474 $ 50,730 GAAP Diluted EPS $ 2.85 $ 1.10 $ 4.53 $ 2.49 Effect of tax reform (1.47 ) — (1.47 ) — Non-GAAP Diluted EPS $ 1.38 $ 1.10 $ 3.06 $ 2.49 CONTACT:\nShane O’Connor\nSenior Vice President & CFO\n978-658-8888\nShane_OConnor@unifirst.com\nSource:Unifirst Corp.",
