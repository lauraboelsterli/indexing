    "text": "March 15, 2018 / 4:13 PM / Updated 17 hours ago Rugby-Gatland not fazed by Jones’ offensive Wales remark Reuters Staff 3 Min Read (Note language in second paragraph that may offend some readers) March 15 (Reuters) - Wales coach Warren Gatland refused to criticise Eddie Jones after footage from July last year surfaced in which the England coach was caught making offensive comments about Wales and Ireland. Jones apologised for the comments on Wednesday. The Australian, speaking at a sponsor’s event, talked about how disappointed he was by his team’s Six Nations loss to the “scummy Irish” and described Wales as a “shit little place”. “It is not offensive to us. Those sorts of things happen, I will let Eddie take care of that in his own press conference,” Gatland told reporters ahead of Wales’ final Six Nations fixture against France on Saturday. Gatland added he was unsure if the remarks would hurt Jones’ chances of leading the British & Irish Lions to South Africa in 2021. “I don’t know, we all say things behind closed doors. I have said on a couple of occasions that if he gets the opportunity he will do a good job,” Gatland said. With England having suffered back-to-back Six Nations defeats by Scotland and France, the fallout following the comments could not have come at a worse time for under pressure Jones, whose team face champions Ireland on Saturday. “The pressure on England is not about the comments, it is about winning on Saturday,” Gatland said. “If they don’t beat Ireland, and they have three difficult games against South Africa (in the away series that follows), they can go from a losing streak of three to six very quickly. They have got their own things to sort out.” Gatland, however, thinks his men are well placed to secure second place in the Six Nations with victory over France at home in Cardiff on Saturday. “It would be massive for us. We felt we could do well in this competition, congratulations to Ireland on winning the championship already, but we know how close it could have been,” Gatland said. “We feel we are in a good place, we don’t feel we are too far away. We are building depth. “Our record has been pretty good against French, we have won something like seven out of last 10. For us, it is about working their forward pack, keeping the ball on the pack, working through phases and trying to take their legs away from them.” (Reporting By Nick Said, editing by Pritha Sarkar)",
