    "text": "STAMFORD, Conn., March 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Green Street Power Partners, LLC (GSPP) announced it has purchased a portfolio of community solar projects all in Con Edison's service zone, from SunPower. A 918-kilowatt rooftop project in Maspeth, Queens, will be the first completed featuring SunPower® Helix™ technology. The project was originated by SunPower dealer Accord Power, who is also providing development and engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services. Construction is set to begin April 1 and expected to be complete by late spring 2018. GSPP will own the system, highlighting the company's increased focus on project acquisition.\n\"This project, along with the additional projects we are currently acquiring, will have a profound impact on our company while helping us achieve our goals of being a leader in community solar, and commercial and industrial solar markets,\" said Scott Kerner, Co-Founder and CEO. \"We are also thrilled about the next chapter in our collaboration with SunPower and its network of dealers, and are hopeful that these projects will be the first of many.\"\nThe SunPower® Helix™ advanced technology which will be used for this 918-kilowatt rooftop solar system is expected to offset approximately 20,496 metric tons of carbon dioxide from the five boroughs over the lifetime of the system, the equivalent of preserving 167 acres of forest.
