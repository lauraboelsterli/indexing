    "text": "JERUSALEM, March 12 (Reuters) - Five of the six rate setters at Israelâ€™s central bank voted to leave the benchmark interest rate at 0.1 percent on Feb. 26, the same it has been for three years, minutes of the discussions showed on Monday.\nThe committee members cited a very low inflation environment and argued that raising rates before inflation returns to its annual target range of 1 to 3 percent would keep the interest rate at a low level.\nThey also said the economy was growing at a pace similar to its potential growth rate and that the shekel was over-appreciated.\nA rate hike is expected in late 2018 or in 2019.
