    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian gas giant Gazprom has filed an appeal against a ruling by the Stockholm arbitration court on gas deliveries to Ukraine, Gazprom Deputy CEO Alexander Medvedev said in a statement on Tuesday.\nFILE PHOTO: A general view shows the headquarters of Russian gas giant Gazprom in Moscow, Russia June 30, 2016. REUTERS/Maxim Shemetov/File Photo The court has ordered Gazprom to pay more than $2.5 billion to Ukrainian energy firm Naftogaz - a ruling meant to conclude a long legal battle that has run alongside Ukraineâ€™s broader political stand-off with Russia.\nMedvedev also said Gazprom would file another appeal before the end of march concerning the transit issue.\nReporting by Maxim Rodionov; Writing by Polina Nikolskaya; Editing by Andrew Osborn\n ",
