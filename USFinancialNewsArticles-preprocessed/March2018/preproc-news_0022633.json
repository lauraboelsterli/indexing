Inflation worries faded on Friday after U.S. data showed nonfarm payrolls jumped by 313,000 jobs last month, but annual growth in average hourly earnings slowed to 2.6 percent after a spike in January. The pullback in wages tempered speculation the Federal Reserve would project four rate hikes - or dot plots - at its policy meeting next week, instead of the current three. Asia-shares ex-Japan climbed 1.1 percent, their third session of gains. On Friday, the three major U.S. indexes rose more than 1.5 percent. \"I think the latest data points are positive for markets. We are starting to see a move back to risky assets like equities,\" said Joel Ng, a research analyst at KGI Securities in Singapore. In Southeast Asia, Singapore's benchmark rose as much as 1.9 percent, following gains of 0.2 percent last week. Conglomerate Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd rose as much as 3.4 percent, extending gains after results last week showed profit jumped more than 50 percent. \"You can see that there is growth in most of its business segments like Jardine Pacific and Jardine Motors,\" said Joel Ng of KGI Securities. Malaysian shares rose about 0.7 percent, with CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, up 1.4 percent, contributing the most to the index gains. The country's banks will continue to perform well in 2018, a Moody's report showed on Monday. The Philippine index rose 1.1 percent, after ending the previous week about 1 percent lower. SM Investments Corp rose 1.5 percent. Thai shares climbed for the first session in nine as financials and energy stocks gained. PTT Pcl was 1.9 percent higher. Indonesia's benchmark was up, with financials and consumer discretionary stocks helping the index higher. Bank Central Asia rose 1.3 percent. Indonesia has capped the price of domestic coal for two years.
