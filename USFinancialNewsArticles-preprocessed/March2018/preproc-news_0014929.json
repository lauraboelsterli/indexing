View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180308006139/en/\nScott Croul, Senior Managing Director and Head of Small Balance Originations, RED Mortgage Capital, LLC (Photo: Business Wire)\nMr. Croul joined RED on February 12, 2018, and brings 30 years of mortgage lending experience across all institutional property types to RED with extensive background in multifamily lending. He joins RED from Freddie Mac Multifamily where he was Senior Managing Director and head of production and sales for the Western Region, responsible for the agency’s conventional multifamily business in the region and the region’s four production offices. Croul was previously Managing Director and head of Underwriting and Credit for Freddie Mac’s Western Region. He brings strong expertise in loan origination, strategic growth and leadership, along with deep industry relationships.\nAt RED , Croul is tasked to grow the company’s national Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae small balance lending platform, expand its national presence and position RED ’s Small Balance Loan Group into an industry leader.\n“We continue to execute on our growth strategy with the most recent hire of Scott Croul to the firm,” stated Ted Meylor, Chairman and CEO of RED Capital Group. “With his vast industry experience—particularly with Freddie Mac—he is the perfect choice to lead our Small Balance Loan team and increase RED ’s market share.”\n“Scott is the consummate professional.
