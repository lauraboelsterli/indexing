FILE PHOTO - Soccer Football - Championship - Sheffield Wednesday vs Middlesbrough - Hillsborough, Sheffield, Britain - December 23, 2017 Former Middlesbrough manager Garry Monk Action Images/John Clifton The 38-year-old Monk, former manager of Swansea City, Leeds United and Middlesbrough, replaced Steve Cotterill who was sacked on Saturday after Birmingham’s 2-1 loss at Nottingham Forest which left them 22nd in the 24-team standings. “The club is delighted to have secured the services of one of the game’s brightest young managers,” Birmingham said in a statement. Cotterill took charge in October in place of former Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United manager Harry Redknapp, who replaced Italian Gianfranco Zola in April.
