    "text": " 54 AM / a few seconds ago BMW says all options open for its DriveNow unit Reuters Staff 1 Min Read MUNICH (Reuters) - BMW ( BMWG.DE ) is keeping all options open for a possible merger of its carsharing company DriveNow, the company’s chief executive said on Wednesday. A logo of the German luxury carmaker BMW is seen during the company's annual news conference in Munich, Germany, March 21, 2018. REUTERS/Michael Dalder “We are constantly reviewing all options,” CEO Harald Krueger told journalists. German car rental company Sixt ( SIXG.DE ) recently sold its half of DriveNow to BMW for 209 million euros ($259.1 million).. The deal made BMW the sole owner and paved the way for a broader car-sharing and driverless taxi alliance with Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) to compete against the likes of Uber UBER.UL and Lyft.
