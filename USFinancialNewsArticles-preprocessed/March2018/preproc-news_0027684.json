    "text": "March 15, 2018 / 9:12 AM / Updated 4 hours ago France says Russia behind chemical attack on ex-spy in Britain Reuters Staff 1 Min Read PARIS, March 15 (Reuters) - France said on Thursday it agreed with Britain that Russia was behind a nerve agent attack on a Russian ex-spy in England, President Emmanuel Macron’s office said in a statement. “Since the beginning of the week, the United Kingdom has kept France closely informed of the evidence gathered by British investigators and evidence of Russia’s responsibility in the attack,” the president’s Elysee office said, after a telephone call between Macron and British Prime Minister Theresa May. “France agrees with the United Kingdom that there is no other plausible explanation and reiterates its solidarity with its ally.” (Reporting by John Irish; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta)",
