    "text": "ATLANTA, March 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Aptos, Inc. , a recognized market leader in retail technology solutions, today announced that Nikki Baird has joined the company as vice president, retail innovation. Baird, a well-known industry analyst who most recently served as managing partner at Retail Systems Research, has spent more than a decade advising retailers on how to navigate the tumultuous intersection of consumer-driven retailing and technology adoption.\nIn her role at Aptos, Baird will draw upon her vast experience in understanding what separates the retail leaders from the laggards to help Aptos customers determine the next generation technology investments that will propel their businesses into the future.\nReporting to Aptos marketing leader Nicole Crowe, Baird will help bring Aptos' innovative solutions to market, including its recently launched cloud-native, microservices-based singular commerce platform that supports retailers' omni-channel transformations and the creation of agile enterprises prepared for \"what's next.\" Additionally, she will work with Aptos Labs, the company's research and innovation initiative, to help retailers stay ahead of the next wave of disruption.\n\"You cannot succeed in retail today without a strategic view of technology,\" said Baird. \"Aptos has taken a strong position in supporting retailers' strategic needs and connecting them to technology enablers, between investing in retail transformation capabilities, the agility platform to make that transformation a reality and the innovation research to keep retailers ahead of the game. I am thrilled to join Aptos and partner with our customers to tackle the pace of the consumer head-on, preparing retailers to thrive today and long into the future.\"\nIn addition to helping retailers prioritize and accelerate their technology transformations, Baird will continue to be a powerful voice in the retail industry, with her insights appearing in Forbes, RetailWire and the Aptos blog.\nThe role of industry thought leader is one Baird has enjoyed for many years. Prior to her role at Retail Systems Research, where she provided advisory and consulting services to Fortune 500 retailers, Baird worked as an analyst for Forrester and Retail Systems Alert Group. In these roles, Baird covered retail industry topics, including supply chain, RFID, operations, point of sale and in-store management.\nEarlier in her career, Baird also spent time at StorePerform Technologies, where she first met and worked with Aptos CEO and culture leader Noel Goggin.\n\"In the 15 years that I've known Nikki, I've been impressed with her ability to identify what solutions and strategies will work best for retailers – no matter how much noise and hype there is in the market,\" said Goggin. \"Nikki brings perspective from all sides of the retail technology equation. We are thrilled to offer Nikki's expertise to help retailers improve their competitive advantage, customer satisfaction and business performance.\"\nAbout Aptos \"Engaging Customers Differently\"\nIn an era of virtually limitless choice, sustained competitive advantage only comes to retailers who engage customers differently – by truly understanding who they are, what they want and why they buy.
