    "text": "FRANKFURT, March 5 (Reuters) - Covestro, a maker of materials for insulation foams and transparent plastics, will replace broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 Media on Germany’s blue-chip DAX index, stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse said.\nThe switch was based on the fast-entry rule, Deutsche Boerse said, which allows a company to enter an index ahead of the stock exchange’s period review if it ranks among the biggest 25 companies in terms of market capitalisation and turnover.\nProSieben will move to the MDAX index of Germany’s 50 biggest companies below the blue-chip level.\nThe index changes will become effective on March 19. The next regular index review will be held on June 5, the company said. (Reporting by Maria Sheahan)\n ",
