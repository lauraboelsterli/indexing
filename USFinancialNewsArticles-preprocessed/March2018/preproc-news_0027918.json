    "text": "March 12, 2018 / 8:44 PM / Updated 16 minutes ago Judge rejects Massachusetts challenge to Trump birth control rules Nate Raymond 3 Min Read BOSTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday rejected a lawsuit by Massachusetts’ attorney general challenging new rules by President Donald Trump’s administration that make it easier for employers to avoid providing insurance that covers women’s birth control. U.S. President Donald Trump leaves the room after meeting with the Houston Astros, the 2017 World Series Champions, in the East Room at the White House in Washington, U.S. March 12, 2018. REUTERS/Leah Millis U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton in Boston dismissed a lawsuit by Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey that sought to block rules that provide exemptions from an Obamacare mandate requiring such coverage on moral or religious grounds. The ruling came after two other judges in California and Pennsylvania in December issued preliminary injunctions blocking the Republican president’s administration from enforcing the rules, which it announced in October. Gorton said that while in contrast to those two states, where there is“no doubt” employers intend to take advantage of the exemptions,“the record is uniquely obscure” as to whether any in Massachusetts would. He noted that after the new rules were announced, Massachusetts in November enacted a law called the ACCESS Act that required employer-sponsored health plans to cover birth control without imposing co-pays. As a result, Gorton said that state law provided reasons to believe Massachusetts women were less likely to be affected by the federal rules, undercutting Healey’s claim that the state would be injured by them and that she had standing to sue. A spokeswoman for Healey, a Democrat, did not respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department, which is defending the rules, had no immediate comment. The lawsuit is among several that Democratic state attorneys general filed after the Trump administration on Oct. 6 revealed the new rules, which targeted the contraceptive mandate implemented as part of 2010’s Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. The rules will let businesses or nonprofits lodge religious or moral objections to obtain an exemption from the law’s mandate that employers provide contraceptive coverage in health insurance with no co-payment. Conservative Christian activists and congressional Republicans praised the move, while reproductive rights advocates and Democrats criticized it.
