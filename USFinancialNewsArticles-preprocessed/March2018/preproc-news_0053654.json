    "text": "HANOI (Reuters) - A Vietnamese court jailed on Thursday a former Politburo member for 18 years after he was convicted of financial irregularities at a state-owned enterprise, adding to a 13-year sentence handed down separately in January, state media reported.\nFILE PHOTO: Vietnam's formmer Communist Party Politburo member and former chairman of PetroVietnam Dinh La Thang (front) stands as PVC's former chairman Trinh Xuan Thanh (L) sits at the court in Hanoi, Vietnam January 8, 2018. VNA/Doan Tan via REUTERS Dinh La Thang, 57, was found guilty of “deliberate violation of state regulations on economic management”, the official radio Voice of Vietnam news website reported.\nCalls to Thang’s lawyer went unanswered. Court officials were not available for comment.\nThang was accused of wrongdoing in connection with losses of up to 800 billion dong ($35 million) in a PetroVietnam investment in Ocean Commercial Joint Stock Bank.\nOcean Bank suffered heavy losses and was forcibly taken over in 2015 by the State Bank of Vietnam, the central bank.\nFILE PHOTO: Vietnam's former Communist Party Politburo member and former chairman of PetroVietnam Dinh La Thang (L) is escorted by police to the court in Hanoi, Vietnam January 8, 2018. Mandatory credit VNA/Doan Tan via REUTERS Thang, the highest-level politician to have been sentenced for decades, will also have to pay a fine of 600 billion dong ($26.31 million), Voice of Vietnam reported.\nThe Politburo is Vietnam’s top decision-making body. Thang lost his position in the Politburo last year, after he came under suspicion of wrongdoing.\nIn January, Thang was handed a 13-year sentence after being found guilty of “economic mismanagement” at a coal-fired power plant overseen by state-owned energy firm PetroVietnam, of which he was chairman.\nThe People’s Court of Hanoi also handed sentences of between 15 months of probation to 16 years in prison to six other people for their involvement in the case at the trial starting on Monday last week, the report said.\nReporting by Khanh Vu; Editing by Robert Birsel\n ",
