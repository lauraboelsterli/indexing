    "text": "March 19, 2018 / 12:28 PM / Updated 8 minutes ago CANADA STOCKS-TSX futures down as Fed caution weighs Reuters Staff 3 Min Read March 19 (Reuters) - Futures pointed to a lower opening for Canada’s main stock index on Monday as markets remained nervous ahead of a U.S. central bank meeting later this week. While it is near certain that the Federal Reserve will raise rates by a quarter basis point on Wednesday, investors are more focused on whether policymakers think economic conditions are strong enough for four hikes this year, one more than the markets expect. June futures on the S&P TSX index were down 0.12 percent at 8:15 a.m. ET. Canada’s main stock index ended higher on Friday as strength in the price of U.S. crude oil helped drive up shares in energy companies. Dow Jones Industrial Average e-mini futures were down 0.4 percent at 8:15 a.m. ET, while S&P 500 e-mini futures were down 0.42 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures were down 1.08 percent.
