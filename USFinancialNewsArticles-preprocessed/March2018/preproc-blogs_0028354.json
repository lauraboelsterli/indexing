    "text": "Getty Images Qualcomm Inc. CEO Steve Mollenkopf. \nShares of Qualcomm opened nearly 5 percent down Tuesday, a day after the company's proposed merger with Broadcom was called off. \nPresident Donald Trump ordered the immediate and permanent end of takeover talks between the rival chipmakers Monday, citing national security concerns. \nQualcomm had resisted a deal for months, rejecting several record-breaking price tags. \nBroadcom remained committed to a merger, despite growing concerns from regulators . It promised U.S. investment in 5G if the deal went through and advanced a plan to move its headquarters to the U.S. from Singapore. \nShares of Broadcom opened roughly 1.5 percent up Tuesday.",
