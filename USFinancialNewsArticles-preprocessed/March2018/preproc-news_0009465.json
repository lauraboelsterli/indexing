FILE PHOTO: A woman walks past a Tesco supermarket in central London, December 9, 2014. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo Grocery inflation was 2.9 percent during the period, down from 3.6 percent in Kantar’s February report. Market researcher Kantar Worldpanel said Tesco and Morrisons’ sales both increased 2.7 percent year-on-year over the 12 weeks to February 25 - ahead of growth of 2.3 percent at No. 3 Asda and 1.1 percent at No. 2 Sainsbury’s. The big four’s growth continued to be outpaced by discounters Aldi and Lidl, whose sales were up 13.9 percent and 13.3 percent respectively. Reporting by James Davey; editing by Kate Holton",
