    "text": "The Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) announced it would close at 12 p.m. GMT (7 a.m. ET) Thursday and all day Friday due to \"extreme weather conditions.\"\nThe exchange said it would close to \"protect against any potential risk to market integrity\" after the Irish government issued a severe weather warning.\nSnow storms from Siberia blasted Britain and Ireland on Thursday with the worst weather since 1991, trapping several hundred motorists on roads in Scotland, closing thousands of schools and grounding planes.",
