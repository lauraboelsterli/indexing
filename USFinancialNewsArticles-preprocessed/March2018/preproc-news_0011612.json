    "text": "Tampa Bay, FL,March 05, 2018(GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nKnowBe4, the world’s largest security awareness training and simulated phishing platform, announced the acquisition of Popcorn Training, a security company based in Johannesburg and Cape Town, South Africa. The acquisition will add fifty-two new training modules to the KnowBe4 library. Popcorn will operate as an independent subsidiary of KnowBe4.\nStu Sjouwerman, CEO of KnowBe4 stated, “We are delighted to have a new creative content team on board and are very enthused about expanding our footprint into South Africa. Popcorn’s appearance in the 2016 Gartner Magic Quadrant as a visionary highlighted their drive to create unique content and we are happy to bring these additional modules to our customers.”\nPopcorn’s CEO, Anna Collard said, “We are excited about becoming part of the KnowBe4 family for a number of reasons. Firstly, it will allow us to expand our offering and integrate with KnowBe4's best of breed phishing & training solutions. Secondly, by becoming KnowBe4's representative for the African region, we look forward to building content and solutions that are applicable to the African context. Thirdly, the transaction enables us to continue to grow and to stay focused on what we love doing, which is creating high-quality cyber security awareness content.”\nAs long as users can be duped into clicking a malicious link or attachment, cyber-criminal organizations are going to continue to take advantage of it. The bad guys are continually testing their latest malware against security software and hardware solutions. Endpoint protection helps protect against a portion of this malware but does not eradicate the problem of social engineering. KnowBe4 is focused on helping IT manage the problem of social engineering to enable users to make better security decisions.\nAbout Popcorn Training\nPopcorn Training is an award-winning security awareness training provider based in Africa with a global customer base, focused on producing engaging content.\nAbout KnowBe4\nKnowBe4, the provider of the world’s most popular integrated new-school security awareness training and simulated phishing platform, is used by more than 16,000 organizations worldwide.
