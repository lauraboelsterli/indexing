    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Quintana Energy Services Inc. (NYSE: QES) (“QES” or the “Company”) today reported financial and operating results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nThe information in this earnings release includes the results of Quintana Energy Services LP, the Company’s accounting predecessor. In February 2018, in connection with the reorganization transactions entered into upon the closing of the Company’s initial public offering, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity of Quintana Energy Services LP from its existing investors.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nFourth quarter 2017 revenue grew 16% to $130.9 million, up from $113.3 million in the third quarter of 2017. Fourth quarter 2017 net income was $2.1 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $18.8 million, compared to a net loss of $8.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $6.8 million for the third quarter of 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2016, revenue was $58.3 million, net loss was $35.9 million, and Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $3.8 million. See the section of this release entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a discussion of Adjusted EBITDA and its reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).\nRogers Herndon, QES’ President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “We are very pleased to be reporting our first quarterly results after having successfully closed on our initial public offering in February. We are proud of the strong results we have achieved in the fourth quarter of 2017 and look forward to a very productive 2018 as the macroeconomic environment for drilling and completion activities, though subject to near-term volatility, continues to gain traction, with healthy demand and a strong need for our services.”\nBusiness Segment Results\nThe following business segments comprise the Company’s primary services: Directional Drilling Services; Pressure Pumping Services; Pressure Control Services; and Wireline Services.\nDirectional Drilling Services\nThe Directional Drilling Services segment provides the highly-technical and essential services of guiding horizontal and directional drilling operations for exploration and production (“E&P”) companies.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure that is used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income or cash flows as determined by GAAP. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income plus income taxes, net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment charges, net loss on disposition of assets, transaction expenses, rebranding expenses, one-time settlement expenses, severance expenses, and equipment standup expense, and less gain on bargain purchase.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of our operating performance or liquidity. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company’s financial performance, such as a company’s cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe following tables present reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the periods indicated:\nRECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME (LOSS) TO ADJUSTED EBITDA (In thousands of dollars)\n(Unaudited) Three Months Ended Year Ended December 31,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2016\nNet income (loss) $ 2,068 $ (8,438 ) $ (35,858\n) $ (21,156 ) $ (154,749 ) Income tax expense 22\n84 140 91 167 Interest expense 2,961 2,901 2,476 11,251 8,015 Other (income)/expenses 58 (724 ) — (666 ) — Depreciation and amortization expense 11,423 11,238 19,224 45,687 78,661 Fixed asset impairment — — 1,380 — 1,380 Goodwill impairment(1) — — — — 15,051 Loss (gain) on disposition of assets, net (339 ) (310 ) 5,595 (2,639 ) 5,375 Transaction expense(2) 822\n— 914 1,091 4,358 Rebranding expense(3) — 7 1,480 9 2,237 Settlement expense(4) 339\n1,191\n678 3,566 1,740 Severance expense(5) 41 — 152 243 1,075 Equipment standup expense(6) 1,387 823 11 3,749 11 Adjusted EBITDA $ 18,782\n$ 6,772 $ (3,808\n) $ 41,226 $ (36,679 )\n(1) For the year ended December 31, 2016, represents a non-cash impairment charge related to our directional drilling services segment.
