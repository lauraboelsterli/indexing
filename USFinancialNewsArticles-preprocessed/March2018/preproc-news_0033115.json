    "text": "CAMDEN, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- International Wire Group Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) (OTCMKTS:ITWG) today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. Operating income and net income increased for both the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the 2016 period.\n“Fourth quarter and full year results reflect improved demand in our largest markets served. Electronics/data communications and consumer/appliance market demand was very strong and the demand in the industrial/energy segment strengthened. Automotive market volumes were down for the full year given the continued surplus capacity serving the Mexican automotive market. As a result, we decided to permanently idle our Santa Teresa, New Mexico facility in the fourth quarter of 2017. Aerospace demand remained firm, while the HPC Medical Products business and our Engineered Wire Products-Europe segment both had very strong years.” said Edwin J. Flynn, Chief Executive Officer of International Wire Group Holdings, Inc.\nFourth Quarter Results\nNet sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $156.4 million, an increase of $36.2 million, or 30.1%, compared to $120.2 million for the same period in 2016. This increase was partly due to a higher selling price of copper and a lower proportion of tolled copper. Tolled copper is customer-owned copper. The value of tolled copper is not included in net sales and costs of sales. Excluding the effects of higher copper prices and a lower proportion of tolled copper, net sales increased $14.9 million, or 10.5%, versus the same period in 2016. This increase resulted from $13.0 million of higher sales, $1.1 million of higher customer pricing/mix and $0.8 million from the effects of favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Total pounds of product sold in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 8.7% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOperating income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $12.0 million compared to $5.7 million for the 2016 period, an increase of $6.3 million, or 110.5%, primarily from higher sales volume, higher LIFO/copper profits, a favorable LIFO liquidation impact and lower selling, general and administrative expenses.\nNet income of $7.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased by $8.2 million from net loss of $0.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due primarily to higher operating income and a higher income tax benefit in the 2017 period.\nNet income per basic and diluted share of $1.59 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased by $1.77 from the 2016 period net loss of $0.18 per basic and diluted share.\nFull Year Results\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $559.8 million, an increase of $33.8 million, or 6.4%, compared to 2016 period sales of $526.0 million. This increase was partly due to a higher selling price of copper partially offset by a higher proportion of tolled copper. Tolled copper is customer-owned copper. The value of tolled copper is not included in net sales and costs of sales. Excluding the effects of higher copper prices and a higher proportion of tolled copper, net sales decreased $2.7 million, or 0.5%, versus the prior year. This decrease resulted from $8.3 million of lower sales, partially offset by $5.0 million of higher customer pricing/mix and $0.6 million from the effects of favorable foreign currency exchange rates. Total pounds of product sold for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by 2.7% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $33.3 million compared to $28.6 million for the same period in 2016, an increase of $4.7 million, or 16.4%, primarily from favorable customer pricing/mix, higher LIFO/copper profits and a favorable LIFO liquidation impact, partially offset by lower sales volume.\nNet income of $6.9 million was higher than net loss of $2.3 million in the 2016 period, primarily from higher operating income in the 2017 period and a loss on early extinguishment of debt in the 2016 period.\nNet income per basic and diluted share of $1.49 for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by $1.99 from the 2016 period net loss of $0.50 per basic and diluted share.\nNon-GAAP Results and Net Debt\nIn an effort to better assist investors and noteholders in understanding the Company’s financial results, as part of this release, the Company is also providing Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA is net income/(loss) excluding interest expense, income tax benefit, depreciation and amortization expense, amortization of deferred financing costs, stock-based compensation (income)/expense, impairment charges, gain/loss on sale of property, plant and equipment, (gain)/loss on early extinguishment of debt and extraordinary non-recurring gains and losses. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a measure in evaluating the performance of our business. Other companies may define Adjusted EBITDA differently. As a result, our measures of Adjusted EBITDA may not be directly comparable to measures used by other companies. Below is a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to Net income/(loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Net debt as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 is also presented below.

Currently, we do not anticipate the covenants under the indenture governing our 10.750% Senior Secured Notes will require us to make any excess cash flow offer to repurchase 10.750% Senior Secured Notes in 2018.\nAbout International Wire Group Holdings, Inc.\nInternational Wire Group Holdings, Inc., through its subsidiaries, is a manufacturer and marketer of wire products, including bare, silver-plated, nickel-plated and tin-plated copper wire, engineered wire products and high performance conductors, for other wire suppliers, distributors and original equipment manufacturers.
