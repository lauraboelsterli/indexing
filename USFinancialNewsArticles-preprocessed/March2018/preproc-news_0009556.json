    "text": "BEIJING, March 2 (Reuters) - Shanghai Guosheng Group, a portfolio and investment agency controlled by the Shanghai municipal government, has taken over the management and daily operations of CEFC China Energy, the South China Morning Post reported on Friday.\nThe report cited two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.\nResponding to the report, a CEFC spokesman said the company has not been informed of any takeover and the management continues to run the company.\nThe reported move comes after Ye Jianming, the chairman of the private firm that has agreed to buy a nearly $9.1 billion stake in Russian oil major Rosneft, was investigated for suspected economic crimes, according to a source briefed on the matter.
