    "text": "JAKARTA, March 9 (Reuters) - Indonesian retail sales contracted 1.8 percent in January from a year earlier, the first shrinkage since July, a central bank survey showed on Friday.\nThe contraction came after the year-end holiday season. There was a drop in sales of durable goods like information and communication equipment, the survey said.\nDecember retail sales had increased 0.7 percent from a year earlier.\nThe survey of 700 retailers in 10 major cities projected that February retail sales would rise by 1 percent on annual basis.
