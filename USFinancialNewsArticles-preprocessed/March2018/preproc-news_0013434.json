However, investors could reassess their anxiety if Trump's plan excluded the United States NAFTA partners.\n\"I believe a more focused tariff that excludes Canada and Mexico, at the very least, would create a wave of jubilation that would cause a return to our regularly scheduled programming of strong growth with tame inflation,\" Cramer said.\nPeople on Wall Street and in the White House were confused about the timing and extent of the planned tariffs, which would hit allies like Canada and Mexico hard. On Monday , ministers from Canada and Mexico met with the U.S. to wrap up the latest round of NAFTA talks, and were expected to press Trump on the tariffs.\nPresident Trump on Monday dangled the possibility of lifting the steel and aluminum tariffs if NAFTA is renegotiated to terms more favorable to the U.S.\n@realDonaldTrumpWe have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada. NAFTA, which is under renegotiation right now, has been a bad deal for U.S.A. Massive relocation of companies & jobs. Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new & fair NAFTA agreement is signed. Also, Canada must..\nCramer said an exemption would not be exactly what Wall Street wanted, but he added the real issue is with the Chinese government, which produces about 55 percent of the world's aluminum. He expects investors would buy on the news.\n\"First, I think people would buy the defense stocks hand over first, the ones that investors think would be hurt the most by across the board tariffs,\" Cramer said.\n\"I bet some of the most beleaguered international stocks of late, the Boeings and the Caterpillars, have a relief rally and United Rentals, a huge buyer of capital equipment, takes out its all-time high,\" he added.\nBut Cramer said the stocks that would benefit the most are right under every investors' face.\nThe stocks that would perform best are \"whatever is working best right now before we got the reprieve,\" Cramer explained. \"That means Netflix and Amazon which are on insane runs as they extend their worldwide dominance. That means Alphabet, which does no business in China anyway, can continue to scream higher as it has been for the last few days.\"\nWATCH: The full Cramer clip on tariffs show chapters Cramer: Trump tariff that excludes Canada and Mexico would create 'wave of jubilation' in the market 17 Hours Ago | 12:55",
