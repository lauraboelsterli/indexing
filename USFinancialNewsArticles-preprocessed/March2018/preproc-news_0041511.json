As we prepare to discuss the regulatory pathway for our AM-111 program with health authorities and continue to analyze the outcomes from our Keyzilen 速 trials, we are reviewing our strategic options focused on enhancing shareholder value.\"\nDevelopment Program Updates\nAM-125 for Vertigo\nInitiated second Phase 1 clinical trial with AM-125. The study will seek to determine the maximum tolerated dose with single and repeated dosing and generate additional data on the bioavailability of intranasal betahistine in humans. Results are expected to become available by mid-year. An earlier single dose Phase 1 clinical trial with intranasal betahistine up to 40 mg had shown a relative bioavailability which was 20-40 times higher compared with plasma levels in an independent Phase 1 clinical trial with oral betahistine at 3 x 48 mg/day. [1] Reported results from a single-dose pharmacokinetic study in Beagle dogs. Betahistine concentrations were determined in blood plasma following intranasal administration of the compound at doses up to 120 mg, oral administration up to 48 mg/kg and intravenous administration at 0.44 mg/kg. The absolute bioavailability reached 27% to 82% with intranasal betahistine and 2 to 6% with oral betahistine. The relative bioavailability of intranasal betahistine against oral betahistine was in a range of 5 to 35 times.\nAM-111 for Acute Inner Ear Hearing Loss\nPrepared for discussions of AM-111 data and regulatory pathway with health authorities. The Company initiated a scientific advice procedure with the European Medicines Agency and plans to engage also in discussions with the FDA in in the second quarter of 2018. Data from a further 31 patients who enrolled in the ASSENT trial with profound acute hearing loss are expected towards the end of the first quarter of 2018. ASSENT is the sister trial of the previously completed HEALOS study.\nKeyzilen 速 (AM-101) for Acute Inner Ear Tinnitus\nAnnounced preliminary top-line data from the TACTT3 trial, indicating that the study did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint of a statistically significant improvement in the Tinnitus Functional Index score from baseline to Day 84 in the active treated group compared to placebo either in the overall population or in the otitis media subpopulation. The Company is investigating the outcomes, including those in the previously conducted sister trial TACTT2, and will provide an update in due course.\nCorporate Developments\nCompleted a direct registered offering of approximately 12.5 million common shares to investors at a price of $0.44 per share with net proceeds of $4.9 million. The Company also issued warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of approximately 7.5 million common shares in a concurrent private placement. The warrants have an exercise price of $0.50 per share. [2] Effected a 1 for 10 share reverse split through the merger of the Company with one of its subsidiaries. The post-merger common shares of Auris Medical Holding AG began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on March 14, 2018.\nOther Developments\nElected Alain Munoz, MD, to the Board of Directors. Dr Munoz is a French entrepreneur and independent management consultant in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. He previously served on our Board of Directors between 2007 and 2015. Re-elected Thomas Meyer (Chairman), Armando Anido, Calvin Roberts and Mats Blom to the Board of Directors. Oliver Kubli and Berndt Modig did not stand for re-election.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nCash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2017, totaled CHF 15.0 million. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were CHF 5.4 million compared to CHF 6.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.

[3]\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nTotal operating expenses for 2017 were CHF 24.4 million compared to CHF 30.2 million for 2016. Research and development expenses for 2017 were CHF 19.2 million compared to CHF 24.8 million for 2016.
