    "text": "Mavericks owner Mark Cuban denies 2011 sex assault allegation Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is denying a 2011 allegation of sexual assault. A weekly alternative newspaper in Oregon published details of a case that prosecutors didn't pursue. Prosecutors said they didn't believe there was evidence to support the claim. Published 8 Hours Ago The Associated Press Slaven Vlasic | Getty Image Mark Cuban speaks onstage during the THRIVE with Arianna Huffington panel at The Town Hall during 2016 Advertising Week New York on September 28, 2016 in New York City. \nDallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is denying a 2011 allegation of sexual assault after a weekly alternative newspaper in Oregon published details of a case that prosecutors didn't pursue, saying they didn't believe there was evidence to support the claim. \nThe report in the Willamette Week in Portland, Oregon, came two weeks after a Sports Illustrated account that portrayed a hostile work environment for women in the front office of the Mavericks. \nThe woman claimed Cuban reached inside her pants and penetrated her vagina with his finger while they were taking a picture in a Portland nightclub. In an email to The Associated Press on Tuesday, Cuban wrote, \"It didn't happen.\" \nIn a report explaining why they weren't pursuing the case, prosecutors wrote that \"there is no evidence to corroborate the complainant's statement and there is evidence contradicting the claim.\" The report also said the woman didn't want to proceed with the allegation. \nThe SI report included claims of inappropriate sexual conduct by former CEO Terdema Ussery and raised questions about what Cuban knew and when. \nDisclosure: CNBC owns the exclusive off-network cable rights to \"Shark Tank,\" which features Mark Cuban as a panelist.
