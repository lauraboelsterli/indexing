    "text": "DeMar DeRozan scored 25 points, and Toronto stayed hot with a 106-90 win over visiting Atlanta on Tuesday at Air Canada Centre.\nKyle Lowry and DeRozan stayed on the sideline for much of the fourth quarter. C.J. Miles and Delon Wright stepped up in their place and fueled a fourth-quarter spurt for the Raptors, who have won five in a row and 12 of 13 overall.\nMiles hit a pair of 3-pointers and Wright had a couple of baskets during a 16-0 run that allowed Toronto to pull away. Toronto outscored Atlanta 30-13 in the fourth quarter.\nMiles finished with 14 points, and Wright added 10 points before leaving with a toe injury in the fourth quarter.\nKent Bazemore and John Collins each scored 14 points, and Dewayne Dedmon had 12 points and 10 rebounds for the Hawks, who lost all four meetings with the Raptors this season.\nAfter a tight first half, the Raptors opened the third quarter with a 7-0 run, but failed to distance themselves from the Hawks. Jaylen Morris had a dunk off a nice feed from Dedmon, and Tyler Dorsey hit a jumper to give Atlanta a 77-76 lead heading into the fourth quarter.\nThe Hawks hit five 3-pointers in the first half and led by as many as eight points midway through the second quarter. Jonas Valanciunas converted a three-point play on a dunk and free throw, and Norman Powell and DeRozan knocked down 3-pointers in the final two minutes to cut into Atlanta’s lead.\nLowry and DeRozan each were whistled for technical fouls in the final minute before halftime. The Hawks took advantage with four Mike Muscala free throws and went into halftime clinging to a 51-50 lead.\nThe Hawks head to Indiana on Friday, before returning to Atlanta to open a three-game homestand that begins Sunday against Chicago.\nThe Raptors head to Detroit on Wednesday, before returning home to take on Houston in a battle of the teams with the best records in the Eastern and Western Conferences on Friday.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
