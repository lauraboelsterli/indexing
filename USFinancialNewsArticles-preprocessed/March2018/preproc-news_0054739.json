    "text": "March 28, 2018 / 9:42 AM / Updated 7 hours ago Internet firms should do 'much much' more to remove illegal content: UK interior minister Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Internet companies such as Facebook should do more to remove illegal and offensive content online, British interior minister Amber Rudd said on Wednesday. FILE PHOTO: A Facebook sign is displayed at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at National Harbor, Maryland, U.S., February 23, 2018. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo \n“In terms of illegal material, I still think there is much, much more they can do,” Rudd told a committee of lawmakers, adding that some offensive material should be taken down. \n“In some instances, they do make a decision themselves to remove the material which they find offensive. I do think there is more that can be done.” Reporting by Alistair Smout and Andrew MacAskill; editing by Stephen Addison",
