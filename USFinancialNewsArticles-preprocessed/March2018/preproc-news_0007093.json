    "text": "Published 4 Mins Ago CNBC.com \nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that there are no \"decisive\" signs of wage inflation yet. \nSpeaking in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, the central bank head also said more gains can come in the labor market without causing harmful levels of inflation. \nThe remarks are significant in that during Powell's remarks two days ago before the House Financial Services Committee were interpreted as being more concerned about inflation, leading the Fed to a more aggressive path in interest rate hikes. \nThis is a breaking news story.
