Output has risen by nearly 25 percent in the last two years to over 10 million bpd <C-OUT-T-EIA>, taking it past top exporter Saudi Arabia and within reach of the biggest producer, Russia, which pumps around 11 million bpd.\nBrent prices have risen in seven out of the last nine months and have increased by about 3 percent this year. Prices have also had three consecutive quarters of gains, the longest stretch since late 2010 and early 2011, after production curbs led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries since last year.\nWednesday's price falls came despite Saudi Arabia saying it was working with Russia on a long-term pact that could extend controls over world crude supplies by major exporters for many years.\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Reuters on Tuesday that Riyadh and Moscow were considering greatly extending the short-term alliance on oil curbs that began in January 2017 after a crash in crude prices, with a partnership to manage supplies potentially growing \"to a 10-to-20-year agreement.\"\n(Additional reporting by Amanda Cooper in London and Henning Gloystein in Singapore Editing by Marguerita Choy)",
