    "text": "(Reuters) - At least two people were shot dead in what authorities said was a domestic issue at a dormitory at Central Michigan University on Friday morning and police were searching for the gunman.\nThe two victims who were not students were found inside the residence hall at the university, located about 125 miles (200 km) northwest of Detroit, according to university Police Lieutenant Larry Klaus. He identified the suspect as 19-year-old James Eric Davis Jr.\n“Our campus is safe,” Klaus said at a news conference on Friday.“We’re calling it a family-type domestic issue at this point.” The university said no one was injured by the gunfire.\nThe incident came about two weeks after 17 students and educators were killed by a 19-year-old gunman with an assault-style rifle at a Florida high school.\nThe identities of the two Michigan victims as well as details on whether the suspect was a student and the type of weapon used were not immediately released.\nDavis had contact with college police on Thursday night and was taken to a local hospital after an apparent overdose or“bad reaction to drugs,” Klaus told reporters.\nThe hospital has no record of Davis being a patient, Rachel Blizzard, a spokeswoman, said in an email.\nThe site of shooting at Central Michigan University is seen, in Mount Pleasant, U.S., March 2, 2018 in this picture obtained from social media. COURTESY of GRANT POLMANTEER /via REUTERS Parents and others expected on campus on Friday to pick up students for spring break were told to stay away while the suspect was at large.\nDavis was considered armed and dangerous and campus police were investigating the incident along with local and state police, according to university officials.\nKlaus said Davis was seen wearing a dark hoodie following the shooting. Police found“a number of articles of clothing” as he fled the campus north along railroad tracks, Klaus said.\nPolice in patrol cars and helicopters searched for the gunman around an area of apartments just north of the campus in the city of Mount Pleasant, according to video posted online by reporters on the scene.\nThe United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said on Twitter sent special agents to assist.\n“The priority right now is the safety of those still on campus and I thank all first responders involved for their swift action,” Michigan Governor Rick Snyder said on Twitter.\nCentral Michigan University is a four-year, public institution with more than 23,000 students enrolled, according to the college’s website. Access to most of the buildings is limited, and individuals must have identification to enter, according to campus officials.\nReporting by Gina Cherelus and Jonathan Allen in New York; Editing by Scott Malone, Chizu Nomiyama and Jeffrey Benkoe\n ",
