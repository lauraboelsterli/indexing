    "text": "Russian hackers may be after your tax refund — and more March 14, 2018 \nThe scammer pilfering your tax return data may very well be sitting in front of a computer in Eastern Europe. \nAn analysis from 2015 to 2017 by Kroll, a cyber security consultancy, revealed that two-thirds of U.S. tax forms on the dark web — a corner of the internet that’s only accessible through a special browser — came from computer users outside of the U.S., namely in Romania and Russia. \nThe dark web acts as a marketplace for hackers, where they can sell medical records and credit card data to fraudsters. \nOnly a third of the tax forms, which included workers’ W-2s , could be sourced back to computers in the U.S. \n“The W-2 has that holy trinity of personally identifiable information – your name, Social Security number and date of birth,” said Brian Lapidus, a practice leader at Kroll. \n“They can be used to steal and replicate your identity, get credit in your name and do other things with your information,” he said.
