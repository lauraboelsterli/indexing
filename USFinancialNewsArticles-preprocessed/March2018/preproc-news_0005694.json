    "text": "(Reuters) - Third seed Roberto Bautista Agut powered past Croatia’s Borna Coric 7-6(4) 6-4 to reach the semi-finals of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships on Thursday.\nBautista Agut overcame a slow start to outclass his opponent and stay in the hunt for his second title of the season.\nThe Auckland Classic champion takes on wildcard Malek Jaziri for a place in the final. Jaziri defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas, 6-4 3-6 6-3.\n“I think I played very good tennis,” Bautista Agut said. “It was not easy to beat Borna... he’s very solid. He was hitting very good serves and playing very aggressively. I didn’t rest all match.”\nBautista Agut, who trailed 3-1 early in the contest, fought back to claim the opening set in the tiebreak. He then won a decisive break at 4-4 in the second set and pushed on to reach his first Dubai semi-final.\nJaziri recovered from losing the second set to pull away to reach his third semi-final on the Tour.\n“It’s a great feeling,” Tunisian Jaziri said. “I am playing the best tennis of my life.”\nSecond seed Lucas Pouille battled back after losing the first set to Japan’s Yuichi Sugita to win 3-6 6-3 6-2. The Frenchman takes on the winner of the match between Filip Krajinovic and Evgeny Donskoy.\nReporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru, editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ",
