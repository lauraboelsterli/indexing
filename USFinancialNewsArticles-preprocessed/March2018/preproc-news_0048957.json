    "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil’s state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro should at a minimum reach a net debt goal of 2.5 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization this year, the company’s Chief Executive Officer Pedro Parente said on Tuesday.\nParente said the company could even achieve net debt of 2 times EBITDA if oil prices remain around $70 per barrel this year, adding that Petrobras is working to regain fuel market share and expects good results, especially in diesel.
