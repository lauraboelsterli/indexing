    "text": "SUNBURY, Pa., Weis Markets Inc. (NYSE: WMK) today reported its fourth quarter and year-end results for fiscal 2017.\nThe Company's fourth quarter sales increased 2.2 percent while comparable store sales were up 1.2 percent when adjusted for the extra week in 2016.\nDuring the thirteen-week period ended December 30, 2017, the Company's fourth quarter sales were $883.7 million compared to $925.1 million for the fourteen-week period ended on December 31, 2016. The Company's net income increased 54.7 percent to $63.7 million while earnings per share totaled $2.37 primarily driven by a $49.3 million decrease in deferred income tax due to the U.S. Government enacting the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform).\nFourth quarter operating income was $22.3 million compared to $27 million for the same period in 2016. Approximately, $1.8 million of the difference was due to the additional week in 2016. The remainder of the difference in operating income was due to the Company's promotional programs and price investments; continued retail deflation combined with cost inflation and assimilation of 44 stores acquired in 2016.\n\"In 2017, we achieved record sales of $3.5 billion and generated our 15th consecutive quarter of increased comparable store sales. During this time, we also worked to efficiently integrate 44 newly acquired stores,\" said Jonathan Weis, Weis Markets Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"We have done much to position our company for future profitable sales growth.\"\n2017 Year-to-Date Results\nThe Company's 2017 sales increased 12.8 percent while comparable store sales increased 1.5 percent when adjusted for the extra week in 2016.\nFor the 52-week period ending on December 30, 2017, the Company's sales increased 10.5 percent to $3.5 billion compared to $3.1 billion for the 53-week period in 2016. Year-to-date net income increased 12.9 percent to $98.4 million, while earnings per share increased 13.0 percent to $3.66 compared to $3.24 in 2016. As previously noted, the increase in net income was driven by a $49.3 million decrease in deferred income tax due to the enacted Tax Reform. In 2016 fourth quarter, the Company recognized a one-time gain of $23.9 million on the purchase of the 38 Food Lion, LLC stores.\nThe Company attributes its comparable sales increases in 2017 to continuing price investments, disciplined sales promotions and enhanced customer experience.\nAbout Weis Markets\nFounded in 1912, Weis Markets, Inc. is a Mid Atlantic food retailer operating 205 stores in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Virginia and West Virginia.
