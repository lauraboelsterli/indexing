The agency has continued to grow at an impressive rate, attracting innovative industry talent and was recently named to PRWeek’s much-coveted Best Places to Work ranking. Ishviene’s fellow Co-Founder, Binna Kim, won this same award last year.\n“Ishviene’s ability to turn a vision into a reality is second to none,” said Dan Simon, CEO and Co-Founder at Vested. “She is a fiercely effective operational manager, a passionate advocate for her clients’ interests, and a highly engaged mentor. She cultivates excellence. The constant influx of new business, qualified candidates, and industry recognition validates Vested’s model, and the agency’s strategic plans would not come to fruition without Ishviene’s leadership.”\nThe Public Relations and Marketing Excellence Awards were launched to reward public relations agencies, departments and people whose work delivered exceptional performance and innovative approaches. Judges for this annual award looked at individuals and organizations who largely go unrecognized for helping to build great brands and products of world-class organizations.\nSaid Maria Jimenez, Chief Nominations Officer at the Business Intelligence Group, “The role of public relations and marketing is increasingly becoming more critical as the volume of innovations, products and distribution points continues to accelerate. Our winners have clearly shown us and our judges that they have the unique ability to marry creativity with business value to create exceptional results.”\nAbout Vested\nVested is an integrated communications firm that is at the front of the rapidly evolving financial sector. The agency’s approach merges deep financial expertise with creativity and an obsessive commitment to creating value for clients through ideas and action.\nThe agency, which has offices in New York and London, is a founding member of the Global Fintech PR Network and operates an investment group, Vested Ventures .
