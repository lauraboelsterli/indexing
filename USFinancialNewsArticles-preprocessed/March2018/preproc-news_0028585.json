(\"ChipMOS\" or the \"Company\") (Taiwan Stock Exchange: 8150 and NASDAQ: IMOS), an industry leading provider of outsourced semiconductor assembly and test services (\"OSAT\"), today reported unaudited consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. All U.S. dollar figures cited in this press release are based on the exchange rate of NT$29.64 against US$1.00 as of December 29, 2017.\nAll the figures were prepared in accordance with Taiwan-International Financial Reporting Standards (\"Taiwan-IFRS\"). In March 2017, the Company completed the sale and transfer of 54.98% equity interests of its former wholly-owned subsidiary ChipMOS TECHNOLOGIES (Shanghai) LTD. (\"ChipMOS Shanghai\") to Tsinghua Unigroup led investors (\"Strategic Investors\"). Under Taiwan-IFRS, starting in Q1 2017 the revenue generated by ChipMOS Shanghai is no longer included in the Company's consolidated revenue. The Company, however, recognizes 45.02% of the net income generated from ChipMOS Shanghai on an ongoing basis. Revenue from ChipMOS Shanghai has been excluded from all periods indicated.\nNet revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was NT$4,408.2 million or US$148.7 million, a decrease of 0.5% from NT$4,431.1 million or US$149.5 million in the third quarter of 2017 and a decrease of 5.5% from NT$4,667.1 million or US$157.5 million for the same period in 2016. Net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company for the fourth quarter of 2017 was NT$163.0 million or US$5.5 million, and NT$0.19 or US$0.01 per basic common share and NT$0.19 or US$0.01 per diluted common share, as compared to net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company for the third quarter of 2017 of NT$162.0 million or US$5.5 million, and NT$0.19 or US$0.01 per basic common share and NT$0.19 or US$0.01 per diluted common share, and compared to net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company in the fourth quarter of 2016 of NT$613.9 million or US$20.7 million, and NT$0.72 or US$0.02 per basic common share and NT$0.72 or US$0.02 per diluted common share.\nNet revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 was NT$17,940.8 million or US$605.3 million, a decrease of 2.4% from NT$18,387.6 million or US$620.4 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. Net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 was NT$3,026.5 million or US$102.1 million, and NT$3.57 or US$0.12 per basic and NT$3.50 or US$0.12 per diluted common share, compared to net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 was NT$1,532.3 million or US$51.7 million, and NT$1.78 or US$0.06 per basic and NT$1.76 or US$0.06 per diluted common share.\nS.J. Cheng, Chairman and President of ChipMOS, said, \"We are pleased that we were able to achieve revenue in Q4 flat with Q3, despite the continued headwinds in our business, including the lower allocation from our largest DRAM customer, product mix changes in our Niche DRAM business and demand softness for gold bumping services. Our ability to offset the pressure was due to the customer, business and geographic diversification strategy we have been executing for the past few years. As a result, we benefitted from growth in DDIC demand, which is being led by higher driver demand from smartphone customers and stable demand from 4K TV customers. We are also encouraged by strong demand for our NOR Flash business, led by wafer test services, which has resulted in NOR wafer test capacity being fully utilized. Overall, we are optimistic for 2018 and expect to benefit from an increased revenue contribution from higher growth markets, including Automotive and Industrial, 3D optical sensing, TDDI, OLED, and 12 inch fine pitch chip on film (\"COF\"). Many of these growth opportunities are related to mobile devices, including 18:9 screens and new smartphone models featuring bezel-less panels, along with tablets, and wearable devices. By offering tailored, reliable turnkey solutions that integrate wafer bumping and assembly, with leading edge OSAT services ChipMOS is positioned to drive growth in revenue and profitability capable of building further Shareholder value in 2018 and beyond.\"\nSilvia Su, Senior Director of Finance and Accounting, commented, \"We exited 2017 in a very strong competitive and financial position, with net earnings of US$2.36 per diluted ADS or net earnings of US$0.12 per diluted common share. Our core business remains healthy led by our diversification efforts. Our geographic diversification strategy further enhanced our competitive position and long-term growth potential. Importantly, we generated US$160.4 million cash from operations in 2017, ending 2017 with a cash and cash equivalents balance of US$271.1 million. This is after we distributed cash (including cash dividend and capital surplus) of US$28.9 million to shareholders, and invested US$158.7 million in CapEx during 2017. We continue to make significant progress in our efforts to increase return on investment and shareholder value, with catalysts in 2017 including the completion of the sale and transfer of 54.98% equity interests of ChipMOS TECHNOLOGIES (Shanghai) LTD. to Tsinghua Unigroup led strategic investors, and funding of the manufacturing facility. We will maintain a prudent CapEx strategy in 2018 as we continue to support our customers' efforts in existing program areas and in new, high potential growth markets where we can further leverage ChipMOS's technical expertise, geographic footprint and financial strength.\"\nSelected Operations Data\n4Q17\n4Q16\nFY17\nFY16\nRevenue by segment\nTesting\n26.6%\n26.6%\n27.0%\n24.9%\nAssembly\n26.0%\n31.8%\n29.3%\n32.0%\nLCD Driver\n29.8%\n24.6%\n26.7%\n26.8%\nBumping\n17.6%\n17.0%\n17.0%\n16.3%\nCapEx\nUS$35.6 million\nUS$32.5 million\nUS$158.7 million\nUS$105.4 million\nTesting\n7.4%\n21.2%\n17.8%\n24.7%\nAssembly\n19.2%\n23.5%\n14.0%\n17.7%\nLCD Driver\n67.3%\n13.5%\n55.6%\n29.2%\nBumping\n6.1%\n41.8%\n12.6%\n28.4%\nDepreciation and amortization expenses\nUS$26.3 million\nUS$23.6 million\nUS$97.8 million\nUS$104.2 million\nUtilization by segment\nTesting\n79%\n81%\n79%\n70%\nAssembly\n62%\n67%\n66%\n64%\nLCD Driver\n85%\n79%\n85%\n77%\nBumping\n66%\n68%\n69%\n68%\nOverall\n74%\n74%\n75%\n70%\nCondensed consolidated statements of cash flows\nYear ended\nDec. 31, 2017\nYear ended\nDec. 31, 2016\nUS$ million\nUS$ million\nNet cash generated from (used in) operating activities\n160.4\n124.4\nNet cash generated from (used in) investing activities\n(109.9)\n(166.9)\nNet cash generated from (used in) financing activities\n(34.2)\n(108.8)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n16.3\n(151.3)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash\n(0.6)\n(2.5)\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n255.4\n409.2\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period\n271.1\n255.4\nInvestor Conference Call / Webcast Details\nChipMOS will host two conference calls on Thursday, March 15, 2018 to discuss the Company's financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017.\n1.
