There were 19.5 working days in February this year, versus 22 last year.\nCombining January and February, exports surged 12.8 percent year-on-year, evidence that overseas demand is strong enough to support solid growth in the first quarter.\n“This slowdown is likely to be temporary, exports will continue to grow going forward on solid demand for Korean goods,” said Kim Doo-un, an economist at Hana Financial Investment.\nEconomists expect South Korea’s exports to grow at a slower but steady pace in 2018 after 2017’s bumper growth, reflecting a statistical base effect from last year’s strong performance and ongoing trade friction with the United States.\nBank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol said on Tuesday that the auto and steel industries could be hit hard if U.S trade curbs were to be further stiffened, because they run the biggest trade surpluses with the United States.\nThe U.S. Commerce Department has recommended President Donald Trump impose steep curbs on steel imports, including those from South Korea, after slapping bigger taxes on washers and solar panels in January.\n“Further wild cards will be the renegotiation of the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. How the talks unfold will affect export sentiment,” said Kim at Hana.\nTrump has criticised the current U.S. trade deficit with South Korea, while South Korean President Moon Jae-in has said the Korea-U.S. FTA benefits both countries by expanding their trade.\nShipments to China, South Korea’s largest trading partner, rose 3.7 percent year-on-year in February in a 16th straight month of growth.\nExports to the United States dropped 10.7 percent as American demand for South Korean cars waned while mobile phone sales receded as consumers waited for new model launches, the trade ministry said.\nImports from the United States jumped 16.8 percent in February, shrinking South Korea’s trade surpluses with the United States to $360 million for the month, down 77 percent from February last year.\nFour of South Korea’s 13 major export items posted double-digit expansion from a year earlier, even as the month had two and a half fewer working days than in February last year.\nOverall imports jumped 14.8 percent in February from a year earlier, exceeding the 13.1 percent expansion seen in the survey. Annual import growth in January was 21.1 percent.\nReporting by Cynthia Kim Editing by Eric Meijer\n ",
