    "text": "President Donald Trump 's personal lawyer Michael Cohen demanded that adult-film star Stormy Daniels \"cease and desist,\" Fox News reported on Monday, after she spoke in a \"60 Minutes\" television interview about her alleged affair with Trump and the threat she said she received to stay silent.\nFox reported that Cohen's attorney demanded in a letter, sent late Sunday after the interview was broadcast, that Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, apologize for implying in the interview that Cohen was behind a threat she said a stranger made against her in 2011 if she did not \"leave Trump alone.\"\nThe letter also insisted that Daniels, an actress, dancer, and producer, refrain from making \"false and defamatory statements\" about Cohen in the future.\nThe lawyer for Cohen, Brent Blakely, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.\nDaniels sued the president on March 6, stating that Trump never signed an agreement for her to keep quiet about an \"intimate\" relationship between them.\nWhite House aides did not respond immediately to requests for comment after the interview aired.\nMichael Avenatti, the lawyer representing Daniels, on Monday morning spoke with major news and broadcast network channels.\nHe said in an interview with NBC the man who threatened Daniels was not Cohen but that \"it had to be someone that is related to Mr. Trump or Mr. Cohen.\"\nWhen asked about the cease-and-desist letter on CNN, Avenatti said Cohen \"needs to stop hiding behind pieces of paper and come clean with the American public.\"",
