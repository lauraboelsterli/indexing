    "text": "48 COMMENTS The University of Texas is pursuing outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to become its next chancellor, according to people familiar with the matter.\nThe former Exxon Mobil Corp. chief executive—who gave his farewell speech as the nation’s top diplomat Thursday and is formally set to leave his post March 31 after a tumultuous tenure serving President Donald Trump —is said to be open to the opportunity of leading the University of Texas System, one of the largest in U.S. higher education, the people said.\nUniversity of Texas at Austin President Gregory Fenves, Rex Tillerson, and Clements Center Executive Director Will Inboden (left to right) close out an event by singing \"The Eyes of Texas\" with the audience and making the distinctive UT ”Hook’em Horns” gesture on the Universtiy of Texas campus in Austin on Feb. 1.

But several members of a search committee are making “a hard push” to draw Mr. Tillerson, a University of Texas alumnus and Texas native, to the position, one person said.\nMr. Tillerson remains undecided about his next move following his abrupt departure from Washington, the people said. He said through a spokesman that he’s receiving many requests and no decision has been made.\nThe University of Texas System is seeking to fill the post soon, as current Chancellor William McRaven, a former Navy SEAL and four-star admiral, announced his intention to step down in May for health reasons. The system has an enrollment of more than 230,000 students, an $18 billion annual budget, and more than 100,000 employees.\nA spokeswoman for the university system said in a statement that staff and administrators are “not involved in the search process for the Chancellor, nor are we apprised of the names of any candidates or potential candidates.”\nRex Tillerson, center, on the sidelines of a Texas football game in 1972, courtesy of the Longhorn band.

His sudden availability may complicate a search that had been expected to conclude soon.\nSome university constituencies had sought a chancellor with experience in academia, as well as a woman or minority candidate, people familiar with the matter said.\nAs chancellor, Mr. Tillerson would take the helm of a sprawling higher education conglomerate with a scale that can almost compare to that of Exxon or the U.S. State Department. The chancellor position would give him stewardship over 14 institutions, including the University of Texas at Austin and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, one of the nation’s foremost cancer research hospitals.\nCal Jillson, a professor of political science at Southern Methodist University, questioned whether Mr. Tillerson would have the skills to succeed as chancellor, a position that requires mediating among 14 institutions, the state legislature and the state’s business leaders.\n“When he was the CEO at Exxon Mobil he worked his way up the hierarchy and he made the final decision,” said Mr. Jillson. “In the chancellor’s job he would be at the head of the table but he is not going to be driving the process, it’s much more consultative.”\nRELATED\nTillerson Tells State Department Employees to Guard Their Integrity (March 22) Rex Tillerson Is Out as Secretary of State; Donald Trump Taps Mike Pompeo (March 13) ‘Rex, Eat the Salad’: Inside the Awkward Relationship Between Rex Tillerson and Donald Trump (March 13) Donald Trump and Rex Tillerson: Timeline of Their Ups and Downs (March 13) The structure of the job would resemble Mr. Tillerson’s role at Exxon in some ways, with the leaders of many individual institutions reporting up to the chancellor, said Kent Hance, a former chancellor of the Texas Tech University system and lawmaker.\n“The most important aspect of the role is having a relationship with members of the state legislature,” said Mr. Hance, who has known Mr. Tillerson for many years. “He would be great at that.”\nMr. Tillerson appeared exhausted and at times emotional about leaving the State Department in several public appearances after being fired by Mr. Trump—a decision the president announced on Twitter—on March 13. He emphasized the importance of being kind and of personal integrity—and has not mentioned the president by name.\nAdding to the insult of Mr. Tillerson’s public firing, White House aides circulated a story that he had been on the toilet when he first received the call that it would happen. Of Washington, Mr. Tillerson said Thursday, “This can be a very mean-spirited town, but you don’t have to choose to participate in it.”\nMr. Tillerson has spoken fondly about his time at the University of Texas. He once joked to a group of students that he majored in civil engineering there because “God created organic chemistry to let people know when they don’t belong in chemical engineering.”\nHe most recently spoke at the system’s flagship Austin campus in February.\n—Russell Gold contributed to this article.\nWrite to Bradley Olson at Bradley.Olson@wsj.com , Douglas Belkin at doug.belkin@wsj.com and Felicia Schwartz at Felicia.Schwartz@wsj.com",
