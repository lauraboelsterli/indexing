    "text": "AMSTERDAM, March 28 (Reuters) - A Dutch court on Wednesday lifted a freeze on assets of former owners of Nidera in a dispute with China’s Cofco, saying that Cofco had failed to substantiate claims running into the hundreds of millions of dollars.\nIn a summary judgment, the Rotterdam court ordered that a freeze imposed in January should be lifted and noted that the companies were in arbitration at France’s International Chamber of Commerce.\nCofco says it overpaid in its 2017 acquisition of Nidera, a Rotterdam-based grain trading company, due to misrepresentations by the former owners.\nReporting by Toby Sterling; Editing by Kevin Liffey\n ",
