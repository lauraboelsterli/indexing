    "text": "FORT WORTH, Texas, March 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Kimbell Royalty Partners, LP (NYSE: KRP) (\"Kimbell Royalty Partners\" or \"Kimbell\"), a leading owner of oil and natural gas mineral and royalty interests across twenty states, today announced financial and operating results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter Highlights\nQ4 distribution of $0.36 per common unit, up $0.05 or 16% per unit from Q3 Revenue of $10.0 million, up 20% from Q3 Net income of $1.1 million, up 792% from Q3 Adjusted EBITDA of $6.3 million, up 20% from Q3 Combined production up 6% from Q3, with 111,216 Bbls of oil, 979,569 Mcf of natural gas and 48,248 Bbls of natural gas liquids produced in Q4 Total proved reserves of almost 21 MMBoe (74% proved developed, 49% liquids), up 19% year over year Initiated a hedging program of fixed-price oil and natural gas swaps for 2018 and 2019 for approximately 10% of oil and natural gas production\n\"We are extremely pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and throughout our first year as a publicly-traded MLP,\" said Robert Ravnaas, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kimbell Royalty Partners' general partner.\n\"We once again generated sequential production growth with 6% quarter-to-quarter growth in our average daily production. We also benefitted from a strong improvement in oil and natural gas liquids pricing that boosted revenues and EBITDA to record levels. Our strong financial performance enabled us to increase our Q4 distribution by 16% from Q3.\n\"Our total proved reserves grew by 19% in 2017 on an MMBoe basis as a result of a combination of the acquisitions we made over the course of the year, new activity on our existing properties and the impact of improved commodity pricing. This growth represents significant value for investors that we expect to be realized over the life of these producing fields.\n\"Since our IPO in February 2017, we have completed almost $30 million of accretive acquisitions, including a small asset package acquired in Q4. We expect to continue to grow both production and reserves in 2018 primarily through additional accretive acquisitions and a potential dropdown of assets from our sponsors,\" Mr. Ravnaas said.\nAcquisitions\nKimbell completed an acquisition of royalty interests in multiple states in the fourth quarter for $1.3 million. These include long-life, shallow decline interests in mature fields with significant hydrocarbons in place and infill drilling locations. The purchase was funded using amounts available under our revolving credit facility. Since its initial public offering in early February 2017, Kimbell has completed acquisitions totaling $29.3 million, the largest of which was the Anadarko Basin acquisition from Maxus Energy Corporation for $15.9 million.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Distribution\nOn January 26, 2018, the board of directors of Kimbell Royalty GP, LLC, the general partner of Kimbell Royalty Partners, declared a cash distribution of $0.36 per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2017. The distribution was paid on February 14, 2018 to unitholders of record at the close of business on February 7, 2018. This represented a 16% increase from the prior quarter's distribution.\nFinancial Highlights\nKimbell had fourth quarter revenue of $10.0 million, net income of $1.1 million and earnings per common unit of $0.06. An increase in net income from the prior quarter was primarily the result of increased production and a 9% increase in realized average commodity prices. Adjusted EBITDA was $6.3 million. (Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure. Please see a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measures at the end of this news release). Average realized price per barrel (Bbl) for oil was $51.78, natural gas per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) was $2.65 and natural gas liquids per Bbl was $22.95.\nProduction\nKimbell reported total fourth quarter production of 322,726 Boe, or 3,508 Boe per day, an increase of 6% from the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to additional production realized from certain royalty interests purchased during the fourth quarter.\nFourth quarter revenues were derived 58% from oil, 26% from natural gas, 11% from natural gas liquids sales and 5% from other sales. Production was composed of approximately 34% oil, 51% natural gas and 15% natural gas liquids.\nReserves\nRyder Scott Company, L.P. prepared an estimate of Kimbell's proved reserves as of December 31, 2017. Average prices of $51.34 per barrel of oil and $2.98 per MMBtu of natural gas were used in accordance with applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Realized prices with applicable differentials were $47.85 per barrel of oil, $2.37 per Mcf of natural gas and $19.26 per barrel of natural gas liquids.\nProved reserves at year-end 2017 increased by approximately 19% year-over-year to almost 21 MMBoe, of which 74% was proved developed reserves and 49% was in the form of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\nProved developed reserves increased by 27% to 15.4 MMBoe from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, reflecting the acquisitions Kimbell made during the year along with continued development by the operators of Kimbell's acreage.\nNet proved reserve additions of 4.5 MMBoe resulted in a reserve replacement ratio of 385% (defined as the sum of extensions, discoveries, revisions and purchases, divided by annual production). The organic reserve replacement ratio was 101% (defined as the sum of extensions, discoveries and revisions, divided by annual production).\nCrude Oil and\nNatural Gas\nCondensate\nNatural Gas\nLiquids\nTotal\n(MBbls)\n(MMcf)\n(MBbls)\n(MBOE)\nNet proved reserves at December 31, 2016\n7,210\n50,390\n1,982\n17,590\nRevisions of previous estimates\n(193)\n(1,535)\n666\n218\nPurchases of minerals in place\n362\n16,312\n274\n3,355\nExtensions, discoveries and other additions\n505\n2,261\n91\n973\nProduction\n(421)\n(3,512)\n(175)\n(1,182)\nNet proved reserves at December 31, 2017\n7,463\n63,916\n2,838\n20,954\nHedging Program\nIn mid-December 2017, Kimbell implemented a hedging program for calendar years 2018 and 2019 in the form of fixed price swaps for approximately 10% of our oil and natural gas production. At December 31, 2017, fixed price swaps for 2018 consisted of 43,070 Bbl of oil (fixed rate at $56.00 per Bbl) and 352,590 MMBtu of natural gas (fixed rate at $2.71 per MMBtu). In addition, as of year-end 2017, fixed price swaps for 2019 consisted of 43,070 Bbl of oil (fixed rate at $53.07 per Bbl) and 352,590 MMBtu of natural gas (fixed rate at $2.76 per MMBtu).\nLiquidity\nIn connection with the February 2018 redetermination under the partnership's revolving credit facility, the borrowing base was reaffirmed at $100 million. Aggregate commitments remain at $50 million, providing for maximum availability under the revolving credit facility of $50 million. At December 31, 2017, Kimbell had $30.8 million outstanding under its revolving credit facility and was in compliance with all related financial covenants.\nFull-Cost Ceiling Limitation Impairment\nAs previously disclosed, the partnership will recognize an impairment in Q1 2018. This non-cash impairment charge is not expected to impact the cash flow available for distribution generated by the partnership, nor its liquidity or ability to make acquisitions in the future. We will reflect such impairment in our financial statements filed with our upcoming Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nK-1 Tax Information for Unitholders\nKimbell Royalty Partners expects to mail K-1 information for tax year 2017 to common unitholders beginning in late March 2018. K-1 tax information will be also available at that time to unitholders online in the investor relations section of our website at https://www.taxpackagesupport.com/krp .\nConference Call\nKimbell Royalty Partners will host a conference call and webcast today at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time (10:00 a.m. Central Time) to discuss fourth quarter results.

We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate cash flow available to pay distributions to our unitholders. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, net of capitalized interest, non-cash unit-based compensation, unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments, impairment of oil and natural gas properties, income taxes and depreciation, depletion and accretion expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of net income (loss) or net cash provided by operating activities as determined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are components of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income, oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids revenues, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. We expect that cash available for distribution for each quarter will generally equal our Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, less cash needed for debt service and other contractual obligations and fixed charges and reserves for future operating or capital needs that the board of directors may determine is appropriate.\nReserve Replacement\nReserve replacement is a non-GAAP metric commonly used by management, as well as analysts and investors, to evaluate Kimbell's ability to replenish annual production and grow its proved reserves. Total reserve replacement and organic reserve replacement can be computed from information provided in this press release.\nTotal reserve replacement is defined as the sum of proved reserve extensions, discoveries and other additions, revisions of previous estimates and purchases of minerals in place divided by production for the corresponding period. Organic reserve replacement is defined as the sum of proved reserve extensions, discoveries and other additions and revisions of previous estimates divided by production for the corresponding period. These definitions of reserve replacement may differ significantly from definitions used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, reserve replacement as defined above may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.\nReserve replacement is limited because it typically varies widely based on the extent and timing of new discoveries and property acquisitions. Its predictive and comparative value is also limited for the same reasons. Reserve replacement does not distinguish between changes in reserve quantities that are producing and those that will require additional time and capital to begin producing. In addition, since reserve replacement does not take into consideration the cost or timing of future production of new reserves, it cannot be used as a measure of value creation.\nKimbell Royalty Partners, LP\nSupplemental Schedule\n(unaudited, in thousands, except per unit data and unit count)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nNet income\n$\n1,061\nDepreciation, depletion and accretion expenses\n4,390\nInterest expense\n323\nEBITDA\n$\n5,774\nImpairment of oil and natural gas properties\n—\nUnit-based compensation\n229\nLoss on commodity derivative instruments\n319\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n6,322\nAdjustments to reconcile Adjusted EBITDA to cash available\nfor distribution\nCash interest expense\n179\nCapital expenditures\n—\nCash available for distribution\n$\n6,143\nLimited partner units outstanding (1)\n16,836,453\nCash available for distribution per common unit outstanding\n$\n0.36\n(1) As of fourth quarter 2017 distribution record date of February 7, 2018.\nKimbell Royalty Partners, LP\nSupplemental Schedule\n(unaudited, in thousands)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017\nReconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities\nto Adjusted EBITDA\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n4,608\nInterest expense\n323\nImpairment of oil and natural gas properties\n—\nAmortization of loan origination costs\n(16)\nUnit-based compensation\n(229)\nLoss on commodity derivative instruments\n(319)\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities:\nOil, natural gas and NGL revenues receivable\n1,193\nOther receivables\n(22)\nAccounts payable\n(164)\nOther current liabilities\n400\nEBITDA\n$\n5,774\nAdd:\nImpairment of oil and natural gas properties\n—\nUnit-based compensation\n229\nLoss on commodity derivative instruments\n319\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n6,322\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kimbell-royalty-partners-announces-fourth-quarter-2017-results-record-production-revenue-and-ebitda-300610545.html\nSOURCE Kimbell Royalty Partners, LP",
