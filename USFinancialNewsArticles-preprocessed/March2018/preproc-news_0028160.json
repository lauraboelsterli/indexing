    "text": "Oil prices rose Thursday as investors weighed signs of growing global oil demand and surging U.S. shale production.\nLight, sweet crude for April delivery gained 23 cents, or 0.4%, to $61.19 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent, the global benchmark, advanced 23 cents, or 0.4%, to $65.12 a barrel.\nGlobal oil demand should grow by 1.5 million barrels a day, to an average of 99.3 million barrels a day in 2018, the International Energy Agency said Thursday in its closely watched monthly oil-market report. The estimate was an upward revision of 90,000 barrels a day.\nRobust demand should help offset burgeoning U.S. shale oil production , largely keeping the oil market balanced this year, according to the agency.\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported that gasoline stockpiles fell by 6.3 million barrels and diesel stockpiles fell by 4.4. million barrels, exceeding analyst expectations and signaling strong consumer demand for fuel.\nBut some market observers cautioned that relentless supply growth, mainly out of the U.S., still poses a risk to the rebalancing of the market that has been under way for the past year.\n“The oil market is more fragile than it seems,” said Norbert Ruecker, head of macro and commodity research at Julius Baer. “Profit-taking risks still loom large [and] strong output growth challenges the market tightening narrative,” he argued.\nNitesh Shah, commodities strategist at ETF Securities, said he was skeptical demand could grow as fast as the IEA predicts, estimating demand growth this year would be closer to 1.2 million barrels a day.\n“We need very strong [demand] growth to absorb the supply that’s coming out of the U.S.,” Mr. Shah said.\nThe IEA report comes a day after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries raised its forecast for U.S. shale production. In its own monthly market report, OPEC said it now expects U.S. shale production to average 5.72 million barrels a day in 2018, a month-on-month upward revision of 130,000 barrels a day.\n“Such an ominous forecast does not bode well for the oil rebalancing,” according to analysts at brokerage PVM Oil Associates Ltd.\nA storage tank in Grotow, Poland. ’We need very strong [demand] growth to absorb the supply that’s coming out of the U.S.,’ said Nitesh Shah, commodities strategist at ETF Securities.
