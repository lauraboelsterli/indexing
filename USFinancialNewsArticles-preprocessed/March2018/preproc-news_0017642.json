    "text": "SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Calithera Biosciences, Inc. (Nasdaq:CALA), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel small molecule drugs directed against tumor metabolism and tumor immunology targets for the treatment of cancer, announced today its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, cash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $186.2 million.\n“2017 was a transformative year for Calithera as we advanced each of our internally discovered first-in-class, small molecule onco-metabolism clinical candidates into broad clinical programs and announced a partnership with Incyte.” said Susan Molineaux, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Calithera. “In 2018, we will be enrolling two randomized placebo-controlled trials of our oral glutaminase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma and a Phase 2 trial for the treatment of patients with triple negative breast cancer. INCB001158, an inhibitor of arginase, will be in evaluated in three broad clinical trials for the treatment of patients with solid tumors in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor, chemotherapy, and epacadostat/PD-1 inhibitor, respectively.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 and Recent Highlights\nCB-839\nPresented Results of CB-839 in Combination with Cabozantinib in Renal Cell Carcinoma; Randomized Phase 2 Trial Planned. In February 2018, we presented preliminary results of the Phase Ib trial of CB-839 in combination with cabozantinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor at the 2018 Genitourinary Cancer Symposium. Preliminary results showed the combination demonstrated 40% overall response rate in advanced clear cell RCC patients, and 100% disease control with the safety profile of CB-839 plus cabozantinib generally consistent with that of cabozantinib monotherapy. On the basis of this efficacy and safety data, we plan to initiate a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial in approximate 300 clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients who have previously received one or two prior lines of therapy. The Phase 2 trial, known as CANTATA, is planned to begin in the second quarter of 2018 and it is expected to take approximately two years to reach the primary endpoint analysis of progression free survival.\nPresented Results of CB-839 in Combination with Nivolumab. In November 2017, we announced initial data from the ongoing trial of CB-839 in combination with nivolumab, in patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer. Responses were observed in three melanoma patients who were progressing on a checkpoint inhibitor at study entry, and disease stabilization was observed in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma patients that had disease progression on a checkpoint inhibitor immediately prior to starting the CB-839/nivolumab combination. The collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb was expanded, and a joint development committee was established to guide the development and regulatory strategy.\nPresented Results of CB-839 in Combination with Paclitaxel for the Treatment of Triple Negative Breast Cancer . In December 2017, we presented updated clinical data from a Phase 2 expansion cohort of patients with triple negative breast cancer receiving CB-839 in combination with paclitaxel. Among all evaluable patients treated with CB-839 doses of at least 600 mg bid (n=37), there were 8 partial responses (22%) and disease control in 22 patients (59%). Exploratory biomarker analysis showed a trend for the strongest clinical benefit occurring in patients with desmoplastic stromal gene expression signatures. We plan to present an update on our TNBC development program in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nINCB001158\nINCB001158 Initiated Combination Dosing. In October 2017, the first patient was treated in the Phase I cohort of INCB001158 dosed in combination with Keytruda® (pembrolizumab), an anti-PD1 immune checkpoint inhibitor. INCB001158 is currently being evaluated in two Phase 1/2 clinical trials and a third trial is expected to begin in the first half of 2018.\nCorporate\nAugmented Board of Directors and Management Team. In September 2017, Calithera appointed Blake Wise, President and Chief Operating Officer of Achaogen, to the company’s Board of Directors, and Sumita Ray as General Counsel.\nSelected Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nCash, cash equivalents and investments totaled $186.2 million at December 31, 2017.\nCollaboration revenue for the full year 2017 was $26.0 million, compared with zero in the prior year, and represents the portion of deferred revenue recognized from the Company’s collaboration and license agreement with Incyte. Collaboration revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $7.3 million.\nResearch and development expenses for the full year 2017 were $43.1 million, compared with $27.7 million in the prior year. The increase of $15.4 million in 2017 was due to an increase in the CB-839 program to support our new and ongoing clinical trials, including our two Phase 2 trials, as well as investment in our early stage research programs, offset by a decrease in the INCB001158 program, primarily due to Incyte’s co-funding of development costs. Research and development expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $15.5 million, compared to $6.6 million for the same period last year.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the full year 2017 were $12.5 million, compared with $10.6 million in the prior year. The increase of $1.9 million in 2017 was primarily due an increase in professional services, including activities to support our collaboration and license agreements and Phase 2 clinical trials, and higher personnel-related costs. General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $3.3 million, compared to $3.0 million for the same period last year.\nNet loss from operations for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 was $11.0 million and $27.8 million, respectively.\nFinancial Guidance for 2018\nCalithera expects its cash, cash equivalents and investments will be between $105 and $115 million at the end of 2018, and be sufficient to meet its current operating plan through 2020, exclusive of any new collaborations or partnerships, milestone payments, additional equity financings or other new sources.\nConference Call Information\nCalithera will webcast a clinical update on CB-839 on Thursday, March 8 th at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time/ 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time.

Calithera’s lead product candidate, CB-839, is a potent, selective, reversible and orally bioavailable inhibitor of glutaminase. CB-839 takes advantage of the pronounced dependency many cancers have on the nutrient glutamine for growth and survival. It is currently being evaluated in Phase 2 clinical trials in combination with standard of care agents. INCB001158 is a first-in-class immuno-oncology metabolic checkpoint inhibitor targeting arginase, a critical immunosuppressive enzyme responsible for T-cell suppression by myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Arginase depletes arginine, a nutrient that is critical for the activation, growth and survival of the body’s cancer-fighting immune cells, known as cytotoxic T-cells. INCB001158 is being developed in collaboration with Incyte Corporation and is currently in Phase 1/2 clinical trials. Calithera is headquartered in South San Francisco, California.
