    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- International Seaways, Inc. (NYSE: INSW) (the “Company” or “INSW”), one of the largest tanker companies worldwide providing energy transportation services for crude oil and petroleum products in International Flag markets, today reported results for the fourth quarter and full year 2017.\nHighlights\nEntered into an agreement to acquire six 300,000 DWT VLCCs with an average age of 1.7 years from Euronav NV in connection with the closing of Euronav’s announced acquisition of Gener8 Maritime. Acquired a 2010-built VLCC, which delivered to the Company in November. Sold three older MRs during the fourth quarter which delivered to buyers between November 2017 and February 2018. Net loss for the fourth quarter was $90.7 million, or $3.12 per share, compared to net loss of $57.8 million, or $1.98 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss for the fourth quarter reflects the impact of vessel impairment charges of $81.1 million recorded. Net loss excluding vessel impairments was $9.7 million, or $0.33 per share. Time charter equivalent (TCE) revenues (A) for the fourth quarter were $65.1 million, compared to $81.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA (B) for the fourth quarter was $22.9 million, compared to $37.5 million in the same period of 2016. Cash (C) was $70.6 million as of December 31, 2017; total liquidity was $91 million including $20 million undrawn revolver. The Company had positive cash flow from operations for the quarter.\n“During our first full year as an independent public company, we made significant progress growing and renewing the Company’s fleet, strengthening our position to take advantage of a market recovery,” said Lois K. Zabrocky, International Seaways’ president and CEO. “Including our agreement to acquire six VLCCs, with an average age of 1.7 years, we will have invested over $600 million in nine highly-efficient, modern vessels since completing our spinoff. Our success capitalizing on attractive asset values at the bottom of the cycle combined with the sale of four vessels with an average age of 14.9 years will enable the Company to increase the size of its fleet by 40% on a deadweight ton basis, reduce its average age to under 9.5 years as well as enhance our operating leverage and upside potential. We continue to prepare for a second quarter 2018 closing and intend to fund the six-vessel acquisition with a combination of available liquidity, the assumption of the debt currently secured by the vessels, and other debt financing sources.”\nMs. Zabrocky continued, “Building on our past successes, our priorities for 2018 are to provide safe, reliable service to customers and partners, maintain a lean and scalable model with low breakevens and continue to effectively allocate capital for the benefit of shareholders. With a strong balance sheet, we intend to continue to maintain one of the lowest leverage profiles in the sector. As we progress through 2018, our balanced fleet deployment and a moderate level of predictable cash flows from our joint ventures and contracted fixed-rate charters will enable the Company to both optimize revenue through the current tanker cycle and benefit from a market recovery in both the product and crude tanker sectors.”\nAgreement to Acquire Six VLCCs\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company entered into a binding letter of intent to acquire the holding companies for six 300,000 DWT VLCCs with an average age of 1.7 years from Euronav NV (“Euronav”) in connection with the closing of Euronav’s announced acquisition of Gener8 Maritime, Inc. (“GNRT”). The purchase price for the six-vessel acquisition is $434 million, inclusive of assumed debt. The six vessels that INSW has agreed to acquire include five 2016-built VLCCs and one 2015-built VLCC, each constructed at Shanghai Waigaoqiao Shipbuilding Co. In connection with the transaction, the Company intends to assume the debt currently secured by the acquired vessels, with an outstanding balance of $311 million (as of March 31, 2018), maturing between 2027 and 2028, and carrying a fixed annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.0%. The transaction is subject to a number of closing conditions including (i) consummation of Euronav’s announced acquisition of GNRT, (ii) amendment of the Company’s existing credit facility as required to consummate the transaction, (iii) the Company’s receipt of financing necessary to consummate the transaction, (iv) completion of the Company’s due diligence to its reasonable satisfaction, (v) execution of a definitive stock purchase agreement and (vi) receipt of all required third-party consents, third-party approvals and regulatory approvals. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.\nThe Company currently expects to fund the cash portion of the acquisition price from existing liquidity, as well as proceeds from financing the Seaways Raffles, which was originally purchased with cash, and the sale and leaseback of two modern Aframax vessels, both of which are expected to close by mid-March, along with other financing initiatives.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Results\nNet loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $90.7 million, or $3.12 per diluted share, compared with net loss of $57.8 million, or $1.98 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The net loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 reflects a $81.1 million vessel impairment charge and a decline in TCE revenues compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. The net loss in the fourth quarter of 2016 principally reflected the impact of impairment charges of $60.1 million and $5.6 million of separation and transition costs.\nThe impairments recognized in the fourth quarter stemmed from a reduction in general asset values in older vessels.\nConsolidated TCE revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $65.1 million, compared to $82.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Shipping revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $69.4 million, compared to $85.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nOperating loss for the quarter was $79.5 million, compared to operating loss of $47.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. This decrease primarily resulted from reduced TCE revenues of $17.1 million and increased impairment charges recognized in the current quarter of $21.2 million. Such impacts were partially offset by decreases in spin-off related costs and general and administrative expenses in the current period aggregating $6.9 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $22.9 million for the quarter, compared to $37.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, principally driven by lower daily rates.\nCrude Tankers\nTCE revenues for the Crude Tankers segment were $42.1 million for the quarter, compared to $54.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This decrease resulted primarily from the impact of lower average blended rates in the VLCC and Aframax sectors, with spot rates declining to approximately $20,100 and $14,100 per day, respectively, aggregating approximately $11.3 million. This was tempered by the impact of 232 additional revenue days contributed by the two Suezmaxes and one VLCC that were acquired in the second half of 2017 aggregating $4.5 million. Shipping revenues for the Crude Tankers segment were $46.3 million for the quarter, compared to $58.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nProduct Carriers\nTCE revenues for the Product Carriers segment were $23.0 million for the quarter, compared to $27.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in average daily blended rates earned by the LR1 and MR fleets, with spot rates declining to approximately $13,600 and $10,800 per day, respectively. The decline in blended LR1 and MR rates accounted for $3.6 million of the decline in TCE revenues. Additionally, the impact of 142 fewer revenue days due to the sale of two MRs during the year and the redelivery of a bareboat vessel late in December 2017 contributed to the lower TCE revenues. Shipping revenues for the Product Carriers segment were $23.1 million for the quarter, compared to $27.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFull Year 2017 Results\nNet loss for the full year ended December 31, 2017 was $106.1 million, or $3.64 per diluted share, compared with net loss of $18.2 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, for the full year 2016. The net loss for full year 2017 principally reflects $88.4 million in vessel impairment charges, $9.2 million of costs associated with the Company’s debt refinancing, and a decline in TCE revenues compared with the full year 2016. The 2016 results reflect a one-time expense of $9.0 million in separation and transition costs, as well as impairment charges of $109.7 million.\nConsolidated TCE revenues for the full year ended December 31, 2017 were $275.0 million, compared to $385.0 million for full year 2016. Shipping revenues for the full year ended December 31, 2017 were $290.1 million, compared to $398.3 million for the prior full year.\nOperating loss for the full year 2017 was $59.3 million, compared to operating income of $22.8 million for the full year 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $117.0 million for the full year 2017, compared to $222.0 million for the full year 2016.\nCrude Tankers\nTCE revenues for the Crude Tankers segment were $178.8 million for the full year 2017, compared to $258.2 million for the full year 2016. This decrease resulted primarily from the impact of significantly lower average blended rates in the VLCC, Aframax, Panamax and ULCC sectors, with spot rates for the VLCC, Aframax and Panamax sectors declining to approximately $24,900, $13,400, and $13,000 respectively, aggregating approximately $84.2 million. The decline also reflects fewer revenue days in the Panamax and Aframax sectors, resulting from an increase in drydock and repair days in 2017. Increased revenue in the Crude Tankers Lightering business and the additions of two 2017-built Suezmaxes, which both delivered to the Company in July, and the 2010-built VLCC that delivered in November partially offset the declines noted above. Shipping revenues for the Crude Tankers segment were $192.4 million for the full year 2017, compared to $271.8 million for the full year 2016.\nProduct Carriers\nTCE revenues for the Product Carriers segment were $96.2 million for the full year 2017, compared to $126.3 million for the full year 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in average daily blended rates earned by the MR, LR1 and LR2 fleets, with spot rates declining to approximately $11,000, $12,900, and $13,800 per day, respectively, which accounted for $27.6 million of the decline in TCE revenues. Fewer revenue days in the segment, driven by the sale of two MRs during the year, also contributed to the overall decline. Shipping revenues for the Product Carriers segment were $97.7 million for the full year 2017, compared to $126.6 million for the full year 2016.\nVLCC Acquisition and MR Vessel Sales in the Fourth Quarter\nIn November 2017, the Company acquired a 2010-built VLCC for $53 million, the Seaways Raffles, which commenced trading in the Tankers International pool.\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company sold a 2004-built MR, which was delivered to buyers in November 2017. The Company also sold a 2002-built MR, which delivered to buyers in January 2018, and a 2004-built MR, which delivered to buyers in February 2018. Net proceeds received from the two ships delivered to buyers in 2018 totaled $17.9 million.\nAdditionally, the Alexandros II, a chartered-in vessel, was redelivered to her head owners during the fourth quarter.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter 2017 results at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time (“ET”) on Thursday, March 8, 2018.\nTo access the call, participants should dial (855) 940-9471 for domestic callers and (412) 317-5211 for international callers.

Accordingly, these non-GAAP measures are intended to provide supplemental information, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared with GAAP.\n(A) Time Charter Equivalent (TCE) Revenues\nConsistent with general practice in the shipping industry, the Company uses TCE revenues, which represents shipping revenues less voyage expenses, as a measure to compare revenue generated from a voyage charter to revenue generated from a time charter. Time charter equivalent revenues, a non-GAAP measure, provides additional meaningful information in conjunction with shipping revenues, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, because it assists Company management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of its vessels and in evaluating their financial performance. Reconciliation of TCE revenues of the segments to shipping revenues as reported in the consolidated statements of operations follow:\nThree Months Ended December 31, Fiscal Year Ended December 31, ($ in thousands) 2017 2016 2017 2016 TCE revenues $65,094 $82,215 $274,995 $385,045 Add: Voyage Expenses 4,332 3,595 15,106 13,274 Shipping revenues $69,426 $85,810 $290,101 $398,319 (B) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA represents net(loss)/income before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA adjusted for the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent, and should not be a substitute for, net income or cash flows from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations are: (i) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; (ii) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and (iii) EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt. While EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used as a measure of operating results and performance, neither of them is necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in methods of calculation. The following table reconciles net (loss)/income as reflected in the consolidated statements of operations, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA:\nThree Months Ended December 31, Fiscal Year Ended December 31, ($ in thousands) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net loss $(90,720) $(57,757) $(106,088) $(18,223) Income tax provision 13 283 44 440 Interest expense 11,367 9,525 40,438 39,476 Depreciation and amortization 20,610 19,403 78,853 79,885 EBITDA (58,730) (28,546) 13,247 101,578 Third-party debt modification fees and costs associated with\nrepurchase of debt\n110 - 9,240 225 Separation and transition costs 116 5,618 604 9,043 Loss on disposal of vessels and other property, including vessel\nimpairments\n81,449 29,734 86,855 79,203 Impairment of equity method investments - 30,475 - 30,475 Write-off of deferred financing costs - - 7,020 5,097 Discount on repurchase of debt - - - (3,755) Reorganization items, net - 233 - 131 Adjusted EBITDA $22,945 $37,514 $116,966 $221,997 (C) Total Cash\n($ in thousands) December 31, 2017\nDecember 31, 2016\nCash and cash equivalents $60,027 $92,001 Restricted cash 10,579 - Total Cash $70,606 $92,001\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180308005091/en/\nInvestor Relations & Media:\nInternational Seaways, Inc.\nDavid Siever, 212-578-1635\ndsiever@intlseas.com\nSource: International Seaways, Inc.",
