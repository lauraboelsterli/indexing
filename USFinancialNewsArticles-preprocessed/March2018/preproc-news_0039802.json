    "text": "6 COMMENTS Good morning. The snowstorm forecast to hit D.C. today has forced a federal judge to postpone the opening arguments in the landmark antitrust trial against AT&T and Time Warner until Thursday. But elsewhere, the wintry weather isn’t getting in the way of a flurry of news. Buckle up.\nFacebookalytica The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica story is moving so quickly it’s hard to keep up. Here are the most important developments over the last 24 hours that marketers should keep abreast of:\nThe FTC is looking into whether Facebook violated terms of a 2011 consent decree when data of up to 50 million users was transferred to Cambridge Analytica, Bloomberg reported. Meanwhile, senators are calling for CEO Mark Zuckerberg to testify before Congress, and U.K. MP Damian Collins has sent a letter to the Facebook chief asking him to appear in front of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee.\nMr. Zuckerberg and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg have pulled somewhat of a Houdini act by not commenting on the crisis publicly yet—an absence that hasn’t gone unnoticed. On Tuesday, a Facebook representative appeared to defend their silence to CNN : “Mark, Sheryl and their teams are working around the clock to get all the facts and take the appropriate action moving forward, because they understand the seriousness of the issue,” a statement read. “The entire company is outraged we were deceived.” Meanwhile, Axios reports that Mr. Zuckerberg will address the topic in the next 24 hours .\nWPP CEO Martin Sorrell chipped in at Advertising Week Europe on Tuesday, saying while the Cambridge Analytica furor will make consumers more “careful and considered” about their privacy, he’s more in favor of “ self-regulation rather than forced regulation ” of tech platforms.\nCambridge Analytica suspended its CEO Alexander Nix after undercover Channel 4 News journalists caught him on camera boasting about questionable campaign tactics the firm could use.\n—Six Questions Still Outstanding—\n1) As regulators and users further scrutinize online data sharing and ad targeting, will other tech platforms get dragged into this, too? (Twitter shares were down 10% on Tuesday, Snap fell almost 3% and Alphabet dropped less than 1%.)\n2) What’s happened to morale inside Facebook? (I’ll wager, “not great,” particularly after the Guardian spoke to a former employee who said its approach to data sharing with external developers was “ utterly horrifying .”)\n3) Is this an Uber moment? Could the #DeleteFacebook movement become significant, or is a temporary blip? Even WhatsApp’s co-founder Brian Acton has joined in .\n4) Will this make more consumers think twice about consenting to share their data for advertising purposes when the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation goes into effect in May?\n5) Are advertisers on Facebook getting twitchy? (I’ve still seen no sign of that yet.)\n6) Cambridge Analytica billed itself as a powerful online “psychographic” ad targeting machine. Is there reliable evidence its methods actually worked? If so, I’m sure some CMOs would love to hear about it. Release the metrics!\nStart Spreading the News It’s not a bad time for other tech companies to take the moral high ground. Google extended an olive branch to publishers on Tuesday, announcing a $300 million commitment to help news organizations adapt to the digital age, CMO Today’s Ben Mullin reported. As part of the Google News Initiative, Google unveiled a new feature that will highlight stories from publications to which a user subscribes in its search results, and it’s going to allow readers to sign up for subscriptions with partner publications using their Google credentials. Publishers will keep 85% to 95% of the revenue when readers sign-up through Google, Bloomberg reported. The New York Times, Financial Times and Gannett are among the launch partners for “Subscribe with Google.” Not participating yet is News Corp, which owns The Wall Street Journal. Speaking at Advertising Week Europe on Wednesday, News Corp CEO Robert Thomson said Google hasn’t “quite come up with a formula that works for us” when it comes to the mechanics around the subscription data and pricing.\n—Lonely, I’m So Lonely—\nMr. Thomson and other News Corp executives, including Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch, have long railed against digital platforms over topics ranging from copyright infringement to their dominance of the online ad market. But Mr. Thomson rued that some of his peers haven’t been so vocal and that he and his colleagues been “lonely voices,” even though it’s in media companies’ interests to speak up. Why is that, he pondered: “Is it fashionability? Is it getting an invite to Google Zeitgeist? What is it: Is it the internship for the kids?”—which prompted the biggest laugh of the session. He also warned that advertisers should be “aware of trends but never trendy” when it comes to jumping in to working with new platforms.\nMade to Measure One marketer who has long demanded more accountability from digital platforms is Unilever’s Keith Weed. He has often used a PG Tips tea analogy to sum up his view of the digital ad viewability standards. “Can you imagine your mom or dad going into a store and buying 50 PG Tips only to get them home and find there are only 45 inside [because] as an industry we have agreed on 90% delivery? It’s absurd,” he said at a Financial Times conference in 2015 . Stricter viewability requirements might be on their way. On Tuesday, the Media Rating Council put out a call for research to help it consider whether the current threshold of 50% of an ad’s pixels being in view to count as a viewable ad impression should be raised to 100%. The MRC is also looking at how “duration weighting” could be applied to video ad metrics, such as whether different segments of a video ad can contribute differentially to its effectiveness.\nBest of the rest Facebook placed full-page ads in leading Mexican newspapers offering “tips to detect fake news” during Mexico’s presidential campaign. [ Ad Age ]\nVivendi announced it will sell its entire 27.3% stake in gaming firm Ubisoft for 2 billion euros ($2.45 billion). The sale is a setback for Vivendi, which also owns advertising group Havas, given it had previously said it wanted to make videogaming one of the key pillars of its business. [ Reuters ]\nJimmy Iovine is the latest top music executive to step back from Apple after its acquisition of Beats in 2014. Mr. Iovine will transition into a consulting role in August and step back from daily involvement with the company’s streaming-music business, according to people familiar with his plans. [ WSJ ]\nYouTube’s kids app showed a video giving step-by-step instructions about how to construct a gun. YouTube has removed the video. [ The Sun ]\nKia says it’s seeing three times the number of conversions through its chatbot than on its website.
