    "text": "Jonas Valanciunas contributed 17 points and nine rebounds to help the Toronto Raptors cruise to a 132-106 victory over the New York Knicks on Sunday at Madison Square Garden.\nKyle Lowry added 16 points and seven assists and Serge Ibaka had 14 points and seven rebounds for the Raptors, who won for the eighth straight time and 15th in their past 16 games. CJ Miles scored 13 points, Delon Wright had 12, Fred VanVleet tallied 11 and Jakob Poeltl contributed 10 points and eight rebounds.\nTim Hardaway Jr. scored 25 points for the Knicks, who have lost seven straight games and 15 of their past 16. Luke Kornet scored a career-high 18 points, Emmanuel Mudiay added 13, Frank Ntilikina had 11 and Michael Beasley and Trey Burke scored 10 apiece.\nNew York center Enes Kanter sat out with back spasms.\nThe Raptors were 16-of-35 from 3-point range and shot 50.5 percent overall. The Knicks shot 45.5 percent and were 7-of-21 from long range.\nToronto All-Star shooting guard DeMar DeRozan had just nine points on 4-of-16 shooting.\nNew York trailed 81-71 after Hardaway buried a 3-pointer just prior to the midway point of the third quarter.\nLowry converted a three-point play and knocked down a 3-pointer in a 27-second span to give the Raptors an 87-71 advantage with 5:36 remaining. The Knicks recovered to pull within seven on Robert O’Quinn’s dunk with 2:41 left before Miles drained two 3-pointers during a 9-0 surge to push Toronto’s lead to 100-84 with 1:26 to play.\nThe Raptors led by 16 entering the final stanza and pulled away. Toronto’s lead reached 120-96 on VanVleet’s three-point play with 7:05 left and the Knicks weren’t up for another dash.\nMalcolm Miller’s 3-pointer with 0.4 seconds left in the first half gave Toronto a 65-57 lead at the break.\nThe contest was tied at 32 early in the second quarter before the Raptors rattled off nine straight points. The lead reached 47-37 on a layup by Miles with 7:02 remaining but New York moved within five on a layup by Ntilikina with four minutes to play.\nThe Raptors again pushed the margin to 10 but the Knicks cut it in half prior to Miller’s late 3-pointer.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
