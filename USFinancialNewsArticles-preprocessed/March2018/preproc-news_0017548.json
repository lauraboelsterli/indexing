    "text": "WASHINGTON, March 7, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Lupus Foundation of America, the only national force devoted to solving the mystery of lupus, today announced the election of two new members to its national board of directors, Andrew Brophy, President of Brophy Properties Inc., and Barbara Polk, President of Amplify People Advisors. Brophy and Polk, along with the other members of the board, will provide organizational leadership for the Foundation's strategic initiatives to bring national attention and increased public and private resources to lupus, a serious and potentially fatal autoimmune disease.\nAndrew Brophy will provide a valuable non-profit perspective to the board, having served on the board of trustees at the ALS Association (ALSA) for nearly 20 years. As a trustee, Brophy served as Chairs of the Advocacy, Communications and Executive Compensation Review Committees. During his tenure, he helped to grow the ALSA Public Policy Conference from 100 to 1,000 participants. Brophy has also built a distinguished commercial real estate career, spanning more than 25 years as a senior executive at Brophy Properties, Inc. in Washington.\n\"It's an honor to be elected to the Lupus Foundation of America's National Board of Directors as the organization continues to lead the way in driving breakthrough medical research and spearheading efforts to advance lupus drug development at every step in the process,\" said Brophy.\nBarbara Polk is a skilled business executive with more than 25 years of human resources, operations leadership and board governance experience in both the corporate and non-profit fields. Polk will bring a breadth of experience to her role on the board, from advising leadership on strategic human capital and operational issues to mapping balanced growth strategies. Most recently, she served as the Chief Administration Officer at the National Restaurant Association.\n\"My involvement with the Lupus Foundation of America began with supporting the DC/MD/VA chapter. I'm thrilled to now join the national board of directors as we work to provide education, care and support services to the lupus community while also raising awareness of this devastating disease,\" said Polk.\nThe Lupus Foundation of America has stimulated and contributed nearly $100 million for robust medical research and education efforts, and has helped millions of Lupus Warriors find answers, support and hope. Every day, the Foundation builds upon this momentum to further enhance its efforts to bring an end to lupus.\n\"We're excited to welcome both Andrew Brophy and Barbara Polk to the Lupus Foundation of America's National Board of Directors,\" said Stevan Gibson, President of the Lupus Foundation of America. \"Their leadership experience and passion will be a great asset to the growth of the organization as we work toward our vision of a life free of lupus.\"\nAbout the Lupus Foundation of America\nThe Lupus Foundation of America is the only national force devoted to solving the mystery of lupus, one of the world's cruelest, most unpredictable and devastating diseases, while giving caring support to those who suffer from its brutal impact. Through a comprehensive program of research, education, and advocacy, we lead the fight to improve the quality of life for all people affected by lupus.
