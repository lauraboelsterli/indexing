    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said she hoped Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg understood why people were concerned about alleged leaks of personal data, but it was up to him to decide whether to face a committee in Britain’s parliament.\nBritain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street in Westminster, London, Britain, March 26, 2018. REUTERS/Hannah McKay “Mr Zuckerberg will decide for himself whether he wants to come before the committee, but what I hope, is that Facebook will recognize why this is so significant for people and why it is that people are so concerned about it, and ensure that the committee is able to get the answers that they want” May told lawmakers.\nBritish lawmakers said earlier on Tuesday they still wanted to question Zuckerberg after the company said it would send another executive to appear before them.\nReporting by Andrew MacAskill; Writing by William Schomberg\n ",
