    "text": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Nuveen Real Estate Income Fund’s (NYSE: JRS) 19(a) Quarterly Distribution Notice is now available. This informational notice provides further details on the sources of the fund’s quarterly distribution payable 4/2/2018, and follows its most recent quarterly distribution announcement . The full text of this notice is available below or on the Nuveen website via Distribution Source Estimates .\nMarch 26, 2018 : THIS NOTICE IS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. NO ACTION IS REQUIRED ON YOUR PART.\nIf you would like to receive this notice and other shareholder information electronically, please visit www.investordelivery.com if you receive distributions and statements from your financial advisor or brokerage account. An electronic copy of this notice is also posted under distribution notices at www.nuveen.com/cef .\nThis notice provides shareholders with information regarding fund distributions, as required by current securities laws. You should not draw any conclusions about the Fund’s investment performance from the amount of this distribution or from the terms of the Fund’s Managed Distribution Policy.\nThe following table provides estimates of the Fund’s distribution sources, reflecting year-to-date cumulative experience through the month-end prior to the latest distribution. The Fund attributes these estimates equally to each regular distribution throughout the year. Consequently, the estimated information as of the specified month-end shown below is for the current distribution, and also represents an updated estimate for all prior months in the year. The Fund estimates that it has distributed more than its income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of your distribution may be (and is shown below as being estimated to be) a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that you invested in the Fund is paid back to you. A return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the Fund’s investment performance and should not be confused with “yield” or “income.”\nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported in this 19(a) Notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund’s investment experience during the remainder of its fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. More details about the Fund’s distributions and the basis for these estimates are available on www.nuveen.com/cef .\nData as of 2/28/2018 Estimated Per Share Sources of Distribution 1 Estimated Percentage of the Distribution Per Share Long-Term Short-Term Return of Long-Term Short-Term Return of JRS (FYE 12/31) Distribution NII Gains Gains Capital NII Gains Gains Capital Current Quarter .2300 .0977 .0248 .0000 .1075 42.5% 10.8% 0.0% 46.7% Fiscal YTD .2300 .0977 .0248 .0000 .1075 42.5% 10.8% 0.0% 46.7% 1 Net investment income (NII) is a projection through the end of the current calendar quarter using actual data through the stated month-end date above. Capital gain amounts are as of the stated date above. JRS owns REIT securities which attribute their distributions to various sources including NII, gains, and return of capital. The NII estimates above are based on prior year attributions which can be expected to differ from the actual final attributions for the current year. The following table provides information regarding JRS’ distributions and total return performance over various time periods. This information is intended to help you better understand whether returns for the specified time periods were sufficient to meet distributions.\nData as of 2/28/2018 Annualized Cumulative JRS (FYE 12/31) Quarterly Fiscal YTD Net Asset 5-Year Fiscal YTD Fiscal YTD Fiscal YTD Inception Date Distribution Distributions Value Return on NAV Dist Rate on NAV 1 Return on NAV Dist Rate on NAV 1 Nov 2001 .2300 .2300 10.02 6.82% 9.18% -11.72% 2.30% 1 As a percentage of 2/28/18 NAV.
