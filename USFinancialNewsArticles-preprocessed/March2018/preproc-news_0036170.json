    "text": "11 COMMENTS Regarding Akash Chougule’s “ Why Should Unions Have Eternal Life? ” (op-ed, March 14): I have represented auto workers at the local level for over 27 years of my 35 year career at General Motors and Saturn. I came to the conclusion long ago that union representatives on the plant floor spend 90% of their time representing 10% of the workforce that fall into the category of malcontents, chronic substance and alcohol abusers and shirkers.\nThe union structure that continues to support “eternal life” for the American labor-union system was constructed in 1935 under the National Labor Relations Act. This obsolete labor law provides for union leaders to be elected by a convention system, whereby union members elect “delegates” to the conventions. This worker “democratic” structure and process meets every three to five years to rubber stamp the election of union officers and set bargaining and political goals. Congress needs to consider another alternative to this outdated law that goes beyond recertification of unions.\nMichael Bennett\nMiramar Beach, Fla.\nI was not present, nor did I have the opportunity to vote for anyone who was present, at the time of the certification vote on the U.S. Constitution. Nor did I have the chance to vote for or against many of the congressional delegates who enacted numerous laws which still stand and affect me and others. My hometown was chartered on Dec. 26, 1753. Must that be redone as well?\nUnion activities, strikes, contracts etc., are all subject to ratification by the current membership on one side and current management on the other. Union leadership is decided by current members. Why are unions singled out for such criticism? Mr. Chougule’s claims strike a hollow note.\nKen McCaffrey\nBrattleboro, Vt.",
