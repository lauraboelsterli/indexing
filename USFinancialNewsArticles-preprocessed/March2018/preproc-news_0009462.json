    "text": "(Corrects day in paragraph 1 to Tuesday) March 6 (Reuters) - Gold prices edged up early on Tuesday on a softer dollar, amid worries about a global trade war even as U.S. President Donald Trump faced pressure from political and trade allies over his plan for steel and aluminum tariffs. FUNDAMENTALS * Spot gold was trading up 0.2 percent at $1,322.88 per ounce at 0117 GMT. * U.S. gold futures for April delivery rose 0.3 percent to $1,323.70 per ounce. * The dollar index , which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was down 0.2 percent at 89.891. * Asian shares regained some ground on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump faced growing pressure from political allies to pull back from proposed steel and aluminium tariffs, easing investor worries about an imminent trade war. * Mexican and U.S. officials pushed on Monday to speed up NAFTA negotiations, with the United States floating the idea of reaching an agreement \"in principle\" in coming weeks to avoid political headwinds later this year. * Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday she would work with France to tackle pressing issues such as trade policy, the war in Syria and competition with China after the Social Democrats (SPD) approved joining a coalition with her conservatives. * Two anti-establishment leaders made early plays to govern Italy on Monday, triggering concern in the euro zone following an inconclusive election where voters shunted mainstream parties to the sidelines. * The uncertainty surrounding Italy's election vote has no immediate impact on the country's sovereign credit rating, ratings firms S&P Global and DBRS said on Monday. * China aims to expand its economy by around 6.5 percent this year, the same as in 2017, while pressing ahead with its campaign to reduce risks in the financial system, Premier Li Keqiang said Monday.
