Each unit consists of one share of the Company's common stock and one warrant. Each warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of the Company's common stock at $11.50 per share. Once the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the common stock and warrants are expected to be listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the ticker symbols \"TIBR\" and \"TIBRW\", respectively.\nThe Company is a blank check company formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. While the Company may pursue an initial business combination target in any business or industry, it intends to focus its search on the insurance sector.

Chardan acted as lead manager. The Company has granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 2,250,000 units at the initial public offering price to cover over-allotments, if any.\nOf the proceeds received from the consummation of the initial public offering, a simultaneous private placement of units and a loan provided by Lagniappe Ventures LLC, the Company's sponsor, $151,500,000 (or $10.10 per unit sold in the public offering) was placed in trust. An audited balance sheet of the Company as of March 20, 2018 reflecting receipt of the proceeds upon consummation of the initial public offering, the private placement and the sponsor loan will be included as an exhibit to a Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nEllenoff Grossman & Schole LLP acted as counsel to the Company and Graubard Miller acted as counsel to the underwriters.\nThe offering is being made only by means of a prospectus.
