    "text": "(Reuters) - Sauber have promoted female Colombian racer Tatiana Calderon to the role of Formula One test driver after a year in a development role.\nThe 24-year-old, who is backed by the team’s Mexican sponsor Telmex, is competing in the GP3 series again this season after finishing 18th overall last year.\nSwiss-based Sauber were the first Formula One team to have a female principal, although Monisha Kaltenborn departed last year. They also had Swiss racer Simona de Silvestro as an ‘affiliated driver’ in 2014.\nItalian Antonio Giovinazzi, who raced for Ferrari-powered Sauber as a stand-in last year, is the reserve driver.\nFormula One has not had a woman driver start a grand prix since 1976.\nReporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Jon Boyle\n ",
