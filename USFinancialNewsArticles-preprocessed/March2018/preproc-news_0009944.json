    "text": "ENGLEWOOD, Colo., Ascent Capital Group, Inc. (“Ascent” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq:ASCMA) has reported results for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2017. Ascent is a holding company that owns MONI, one of the nation’s largest home security alarm monitoring companies.\nHeadquartered in the Dallas Fort-Worth area, MONI provides security alarm monitoring services to approximately one million residential and commercial customers as of December 31, 2017. MONI’s long-term monitoring contracts provide high margin recurring revenue that results in predictable and stable cash flow.\nHighlights:\nAscent’s net revenue for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $133.5 million and $553.5 million, respectively Ascent’s net loss for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $16.0 million and $107.6 million, respectively. MONI’s net loss for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $14.6 million and $111.3 million, respectively Ascent’s Adjusted EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $72.9 million and $306.3 million, respectively. MONI’s Adjusted EBITDA for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $73.8 million and $313.6 million, respectively On February 26, 2018 MONI announced an exclusive, long-term, trademark licensing agreement with The Brink’s Company (NYSE:BCO), which will result in a complete rebranding of MONI and LiveWatch as BRINKS Home Security. The rebrand is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018 MONI launched its professional monitoring services for the Nest Secure alarm system through its direct to consumer channel on December 5, 2017, and through the Nest Secure app on February 20, 2018\nAscent Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Fitzgerald stated, “The MONI team continued to work hard toward its objective of creating a broader, more diversified distribution platform in 2017, and building a solid foundation for a stronger, more competitive organization in an evolving smart home security market. I also believe that the recently announced rebranding to BRINKS Home Security is a critical step in our continuing transition to reach customers more effectively and I am confident that the work being done today will create a more reliable path to improved performance and long-term value to our shareholders.”\nJeffery Gardner, President and Chief Executive Officer of MONI said, “2017 was a transformational year for the MONI business. In addition to successfully launching and diversifying our direct-to-consumer sales channel, we announced a meaningful new partnership with Nest, drove tangible reductions in operating expenses, and made solid progress stabilizing dealer economics. Capping this off, we recently partnered with Brinks to license the rights to the BRINKS Home Security brand name, an iconic, 150 year old brand with national recognition and broad consumer awareness. In a crowded smart home security market, it is increasingly important to have a heavy-weight brand that consumers nationwide can identify with and trust. Going to market with the #2 nationally recognized name in home security will provide us with a more dynamic growth profile and strengthens MONI’s position as a leader in the smart-home security market.”\nResults for the Three and Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, Ascent reported net revenue of $133.5 million, a decrease of 5.1%. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, net revenue totaled $553.5 million, a decrease of 3.0%. The reduction in revenue for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 is due to the lower average number of subscribers in 2017 as a result of the softness in the dealer channel and customer attrition. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in average recurring monthly revenue (“RMR”) per subscriber to $44.04 due to certain price increases enacted during the past twelve months and, for the twelve months ending, an increase in average RMR per new subscriber acquired.\nAscent’s total cost of services for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased 1.1% to $29.4 million. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 Ascent’s total costs of services increased 3.4% to $119.2 million. The increase for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 is attributable to increased field service costs due to a higher volume of retention jobs being completed and an increase in expensed subscriber acquisition costs (or \"SAC\") primarily as a result of the initiation of MONI’s direct installation sales channel. Subscriber acquisition costs were $3.4 million and $12.2 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively as compared to $2.5 million and $8.9 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, respectively. Subscriber acquisition costs recognized in cost of services include certain equipment costs and MONI labor expenditures associated with the creation of new subscribers at both MONI and LiveWatch.\nAscent’s selling, general & administrative (\"SG&A\") costs for the three months ended December 31, 2017, increased 8.1% to $31.1 million. SG&A costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, increased 33.4% to $167.9 million. The increase in SG&A for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 is primarily attributable to a $28.0 million legal settlement recognized in the second quarter of 2017 in relation to putative class action litigation of alleged violation of telemarketing laws. Contributing to the increase in SG&A costs in 2017 was a $7.2 million gain on the revaluation of a dealer liability related to the Security Networks Acquisition that was recorded in 2016 with only a similar gain of $1.4 million recorded in 2017. Other increases are attributed to consulting fees incurred on strategic company initiatives as well as the severance event and transitioning executive leadership at MONI's Dallas, Texas headquarters.\nSubscriber acquisition costs in SG&A increased to $7.2 million and $28.2 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $6.4 million and $20.4 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of increased direct-to-consumer sales activities at MONI.\nAscent reported a net loss from continuing operations for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 of $16.0 million and $107.7 million, respectively, compared to net loss from continuing operations of $18.8 million and $91.2 million in the prior year periods.\nMONI reported a net loss for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 of $14.6 million and $111.3 million, respectively, compared to a net loss of $16.6 million and $76.3 million in the prior year periods.\nAscent’s Adjusted EBITDA decreased 11.4% to $72.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Ascent’s Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 decreased 9.7% to $306.3 million. MONI’s Adjusted EBITDA decreased 10.5% and 9.1% to $73.8 million and $313.6 million during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, respectively. The decrease for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 is primarily the result of lower revenues and an increase in expensed subscriber acquisition costs, net of related revenue, associated with an increase in MONI’s direct-to-consumer sales activities. MONI's Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was 55.2% and 56.7%, respectively, compared to 58.6% and 60.5% in the prior year periods.\nThe expensed portion of subscriber acquisition costs, net of related revenues for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $9.4 million and $35.5 million, as compared to $7.5 million and $24.1 million in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nFor a reconciliation of net loss from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA, please see the Appendix of this release.\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 Beginning balance of accounts 1,046,791 1,089,535 Accounts acquired 95,786 125,292 Accounts canceled (155,098 ) (149,880 ) Canceled accounts guaranteed by dealer and other adjustments (a) (b) (11,483 ) (18,156 ) Ending balance of accounts 975,996 1,046,791 Monthly weighted average accounts 1,016,798 1,069,901 Attrition rate – Unit 15.3 % 14.0 % Attrition rate - RMR (c) 13.7 % 12.3 % Core Attrition (d) 14.5 % 13.5 %\n(a) Includes canceled accounts that are contractually guaranteed to be refunded from holdback.\n(b) Includes an estimated 4,532 and 11,175 accounts included in our Radio Conversion Program that primarily canceled in excess of their expected attrition for the twelve months ending December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n(c) The RMR of canceled accounts follows the same definition as subscriber unit attrition as noted above. RMR attrition is defined as the RMR of canceled accounts in a given period, adjusted for the impact of price increases or decreases in that period, divided by the weighted average of RMR for that period.\n(d) Core Attrition reflects the long-term attrition characteristics of MONI’s base by excluding the one-time bulk buy of 113,000 accounts from Pinnacle Security in 2012 and 2013.\nMONI’s core account portfolio unit attrition rate for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, which excludes attrition of the Pinnacle Security accounts, was 14.5%, compared to 13.5% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. An increase in the number of subscriber accounts with five-year contracts reaching the end of their initial contract term as well as a more aggressive price increase strategy contributed to the increase in attrition in the period. Overall unit attrition increased from 14.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 to 15.3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Overall attrition reflects the impact of the Pinnacle Security bulk buys, where MONI purchased approximately 113,000 accounts from Pinnacle Security in 2012 and 2013, which are now experiencing normal end-of-term attrition.\nRMR attrition for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 increased to 13.7% from 12.3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, reflecting price decreases related to the Company’s efforts to secure contract extensions from existing customers.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, MONI acquired 18,363 and 26,227 subscriber accounts, respectively.\nAscent Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2017, on a consolidated basis, Ascent had $116.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. A portion of these assets may be used to decrease debt obligations or fund stock repurchases, strategic acquisitions or investment opportunities.\nAt December 31, 2017, the existing long-term debt includes the principal balance of $1.8 billion under the MONI Senior Notes, Credit Facility term loan, Credit Facility revolver and Ascent’s Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes have an outstanding principal balance of $96.8 million as of December 31, 2017 and mature July 15, 2020. The Senior Notes have an outstanding principal balance of $585.0 million as of December 31, 2017 and mature on April 1, 2020. The Credit Facility term loan has an outstanding principal balance of $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2017 and requires principal payments of approximately $2.8 million per quarter with the remaining amount becoming due on September 30, 2022, except as described in the Company’s upcoming Form 10-K for Fiscal 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the Credit Facility revolver has an outstanding balance of $68.5 million and becomes due on September 30, 2021, except as described in the Company’s upcoming Form 10-K for Fiscal 2017.\nConference Call\nAscent will host a call today, Thursday, March 1, 2018 at 5:00 pm ET.

Ascent Capital believes that Adjusted EBITDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of its business, including the business' ability to fund its ongoing acquisition of subscriber accounts, its capital expenditures and to service its debt. In addition, this measure is used by management to evaluate operating results and perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also a measure that is customarily used by financial analysts to evaluate the financial performance of companies in the security alarm monitoring industry and is one of the financial measures, subject to certain adjustments, by which MONI's covenants are calculated under the agreements governing their debt obligations. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"), should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss and is indicative neither of our results of operations nor of cash flows available to fund all of our cash needs. It is, however, a measurement that Ascent Capital believes is useful to investors in analyzing its operating performance. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure.
