To participate in the conference call, please select your dial in number from the list included below, and use the confirmation code 6683242 . The webcast may be accessed on the homepage of the argenx website at www.argenx.com or by clicking here .\n\"2017 was a year of tremendous momentum for argenx as we made progress on our pipeline and increased value for our shareholders. As a result of this focused execution, we believe we are well-positioned to advance our pipeline through several key clinical milestones in the year ahead,\" commented Tim Van Hauwermeiren, CEO of argenx. \"In December, we announced positive clinical data from our Phase 2 trial of ARGX-113 for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis and plan to advance ARGX-113 to Phase 3 in this indication. This also marked the first dataset from our Phase 2 program aimed at evaluating the role of ARGX-113 in indications where the reduction of pathogenic autoantibodies may mediate disease. We continue to evaluate the asset in two additional Phase 2 indications, immune thrombocytopenia and pemphigus vulgaris, and expect to report data from both in the second half of 2018. We also advanced our lead oncology asset and reported interim data from our Phase 1/2 trial of ARGX-110 in acute myeloid leukemia, which we expect to transition into a Phase 2 trial this year. We feel that our achievements in 2017 have further validated our disciplined and differentiated approach to antibody development and look forward to providing updates on several important catalysts from our wholly-owned pipeline and strategic collaborations in 2018.\"\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 AND RECENT HIGHLIGHTS\nReported positive topline results from Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of ARGX-113 (efgartigimod) in generalized myasthenia gravis (MG) showing a strong clinical improvement over placebo throughout the entire duration of the trial as well as a favorable tolerability profile consistent with Phase 1 data. Launched Phase 1 trial with subcutaneous formulation of ARGX-113 evaluating pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), safety and tolerability. Presented updates on Phase 1/2 clinical trials of ARGX-110 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) during American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. Raised approximately $266 million in gross proceeds in an upsized U.S. public offering.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (as of December 31, 2017) (compared to financial highlights as of December 31, 2016)\nOperating income of €41.3 million (December 31, 2016: €17.2 million). Net loss of €28.1 million (December 31, 2016: €21.4 million). Cash position of €359.8 million (cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets) allowing us to pursue development of our pipeline as planned.\nDETAILS OF OPERATIONAL RESULTS\nProducts in Clinical Development:\nARGX-113 (efgartigimod)\nReported positive topline results from Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial of ARGX-113 in generalized MG. ARGX-113 treatment resulted in a strong clinical improvement over placebo as measured by all four predefined clinical efficacy scales throughout the entire duration of the study. Among ARGX-113 treated patients, 75% had a clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvement for a period of at least six consecutive study weeks versus 25% of patients on placebo. Primary endpoint analysis revealed ARGX-113 to be well-tolerated in all patients and consistent with Phase 1 data. Nearing complete enrollment in the Phase 2 clinical trial of ARGX-113 in immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Amended ITP trial protocol to extend the follow-up period from eight weeks to 21 weeks. In addition, a one-year open label extension study was added as a second amendment to allow (re)treatment of the ITP patients from the first study (dosed at 10 mg/kg). Launched Phase 1 trial to evaluate the PK, PD, safety and tolerability of a subcutaneously administered formulation of ARGX-113 in healthy volunteers.\nARGX-110\nProvided updates on Phase 1/2 clinical trials of ARGX-110 in AML and CTCL during ASH Annual Meeting. Data from the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ARGX-110 in combination with azacitidine in six newly diagnosed AML patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy showed signs of clinical activity, including complete remission (3/6 patients), complete remission with incomplete blood count recovery (1/6 patients) and partial response (2/6 patients). One of the patients that achieved a complete remission bridged to allogeneic stem cell transplant after five cycles. The preliminary data from the first set of patients suggest ARGX-110 is active both at the circulating and bone marrow blast levels and at the leukemic stem cell level. The data showed a favorable tolerability profile with no exacerbation of azacitidine toxicity. Amended Phase 1/2 AML trial protocol to add a 20mg/kg dose cohort to the dose escalation to best inform the recommended dose for a Phase 2 study. Data from the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ARGX-110 in relapsed/refractory CTCL patients. Of the 22 CTCL patients under analysis, we observed one complete response, two partial responses and 10 patients with stable disease. ARGX-110 was observed to have a favorable tolerability profile in these CTCL patients.\nCollaborations\nBird Rock Bio, Inc. (BRB) and argenx have mutually agreed to terminate BRB's license agreement to develop and commercialize ARGX-109 (gerilimzumab). Genor, a sublicensee of Bird Rock Bio, will continue to develop ARGX-109 for the Chinese market.\nCorporate\nIntellectual property portfolio now includes 80 granted and 109 pending patents as of December 31, 2017. Company expanded to 95 employees and consultants in support of the growth of the business. Established argenx US, Inc., a subsidiary located in Boston, MA. Nominated James Michael Daly as a new member of the Board of Directors, subject to approval by the shareholders at the annual general meeting.\nOUTLOOK 2018\nargenx continues to implement its business plan through advancing its deep pipeline of differentiated antibody-based therapies, including ARGX-113, ARGX-110, ARGX-115 and ARGX-112, the forging of collaborations with pharmaceutical companies and leading academic labs under its Innovative Access Program and the strengthening of its shareholder base.\nIn 2018, argenx aims to execute its ambitious business plan as follows:\nReport full data from the Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial for ARGX-113 in generalized MG at the American Academy of Neurology conference (April 21-27, 2018,Los Angeles, CA) Report topline data of the Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial for ARGX-113 in ITP and interim data of the Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in pemphigus vulgaris in the second half of 2018. Report full data of the Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial for ARGX-113 in ITP before the end of the year. Progress ARGX-113 into Phase 3 clinical development in generalized MG before the end of the year. Report the full data of the Phase 1 healthy volunteer trial with the subcutaneous formulation of ARGX-113 during the second quarter of the year. Provide an update on the Phase 1/2 clinical trial in AML in the second half of the year. Report the full data of the AML Phase 1/2 and CTCL Phase 2 clinical trials of ARGX-110 by the end of the year. Launch the Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial for ARGX-110 in AML before the end of the year.\nKEY FIGURES (CONSOLIDATED)\nYear Ended December 31, in thousands of € 2017 2016 Variance Revenue € 36,415 € 14,713 € 21,702 Other operating income 4,841 2,439 2,402 Total operating income 41,256 17,152 24,104 Research and development expenses (51,740) (31,557) (20,183) Selling, general and administrative expenses (12,448) (7,011) (5,437) Operating loss € (22,932) € (21,416) € (1,516) Financial income 1,250 73 1,177 Financial expenses - - - Exchange losses (5,797) (31) (5,766) Loss before taxes € (27,479) € (21,374) € (6,105) Income tax income expense € (597) € - € (597) TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE LOSS OF THE PERIOD € (28,076) € (21,374) € (6,702) Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets compared to year-end 2016 and 2015 263,047 54,402 Cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets at the end of the period 359,775 96,728 DETAILS OF THE FINANCIAL RESULTS\nCash, cash equivalents and current financial assets totaled €359.8 million for the year ended on December 31, 2017, compared to €96.7 million on December 31, 2016. The increase in the year-end cash balance on December 31, 2017 resulted primarily from €304.7 million of net proceeds received from the initial and follow-on U.S. public offerings of American Depositary Shares on the Nasdaq Global Select Market completed respectively in May and December 2017.\nOperating income increased by €24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to reach €41.3 million, compared to €17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase primarily related to a €11.0 million increase in the recognition of upfront payments and a €9.2 million increase in milestone payments from our collaboration partners.\nResearch and development expenses totaled €51.7 million and €31.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase is mainly the result of higher external research and development expenses, reflecting higher clinical trial costs and manufacturing expenses related to the development of our product candidate portfolio.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses totaled €12.4 million and €7.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase of €5.4 million in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily resulted from higher personnel expenses, office costs and consulting fees incurred to support our growth and prepare the company to become and operate as a Nasdaq-listed company.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, financial income amounted to €1.3 million compared to €0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of €1.2 million relates to (i) a €0.9 million realized gain on the sale of a participation in FairJourney Biologics LDA in December 2017 and (ii) an increase in the interest received on our cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets.\nExchange losses totaled €5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to €0.03 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is mainly attributable to unrealized exchange rate losses on our cash and current financial assets position in U.S. dollars due to the unfavourable fluctuation of the EUR/USD exchange rate.\nThe total comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was €28.1 million compared to €21.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nU.S. SEC and statutory financial reporting\nargenx's primary accounting standard for quarterly earnings releases and annual reports is International Financial Reporting Standars (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).
