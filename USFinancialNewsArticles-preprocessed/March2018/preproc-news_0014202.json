Forward-looking statements normally contain words like 'believe', 'expect', 'anticipate', 'plan', 'intend', 'continue', 'estimate', 'may', 'will', 'should', 'ongoing' and similar expressions, and within this news release include any statements (express or implied) respecting the pending acquisition by Motorola Solutions, Inc. (\"Motorola Solution\") and Avigilon's plans regarding conference calls with respect to its future financial results.\nForward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, actions, or developments and are based on expectations, assumptions and other factors that Avigilon's management currently believes are relevant, reasonable and appropriate in the circumstances, including, without limitation, assumptions that the transaction with Motorola Solutions will complete under the terms, structure, and timeline currently contemplated and that Avigilon will cease to hold conference calls with respect to its future financial results.\nAlthough management believes that the forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could be substantially different due to the risks and uncertainties associated with and inherent to Avigilon's business, as more particularly described in the \"Risk Factors\" section of Avigilon's Annual Information Form dated March 6, 2018 and in the \"Risk Factors\" section of the management information circular dated February 21, 2018 prepared in connection with the special meeting of Avigilon's shareholders scheduled for March 22, 2018, both of which can be found under Avigilon's profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . Additional material risks and uncertainties applicable to the forward-looking statements set out herein include, but are not limited to, unforeseen events, developments or factors causing any of the aforesaid expectations, assumptions, and other factors ultimately being inaccurate or irrelevant. Although Avigilon has attempted to identify factors that may cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those disclosed in the forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results not to be as anticipated, predicted, estimated or intended. Also, many of the factors are beyond the control of Avigilon. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nAvigilon undertakes no obligation to reissue or update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or events after the date hereof except as may be required by law. All forward-looking statements contained in this news release are qualified by this cautionary statement.\nSOURCE Avigilon Corporation",
