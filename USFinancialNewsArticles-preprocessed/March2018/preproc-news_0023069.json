    "text": "NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- William Lyon Homes (the “Company” or “William Lyon Homes”) (NYSE: WLH), a leading homebuilder in the Western U.S., today announced that it has successfully completed the previously announced acquisition of RSI Communities, a Southern California- and Texas-based homebuilder, and three additional related real estate assets (the “RSI Acquisition”). The closing of the RSI Acquisition enhances the Company’s position in the Inland Empire of California and marks the Company’s entry into Texas with immediate size and scale in Austin as a foothold in Texas, as well as projects in San Antonio.\nMatthew R. Zaist, President and Chief Executive Officer of William Lyon Homes, commented, “We are pleased to close the RSI Acquisition today and strengthen our Southern California presence and expand our operations into Texas, which we believe will drive meaningful benefits from our increased operating scale and geographic footprint. As we have previously discussed, we are extremely excited to welcome the RSI team into the William Lyon Homes family, and look forward to working with them to continue providing our customers with a superior product and exceptional services, while driving strong returns to our shareholders.”\nAbout William Lyon Homes\nWilliam Lyon Homes is one of the largest Western U.S. regional homebuilders.
