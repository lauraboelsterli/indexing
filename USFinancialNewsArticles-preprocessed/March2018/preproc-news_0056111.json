    "text": "PORT LOUIS, March 30 (Reuters) - The economy of Mauritius is expected to grow by 3.9 percent this year, down from a previous forecast of 4.0 percent in December, due to an expected slowdown in agriculture and fishing activities, the statistics office said on Friday.\nThe Indian Ocean island economy expanded by 3.8 percent in 2017, lower than the previous estimate of 3.9 percent.\nStatistics Mauritius said agriculture would expand by 1.1 percent this year instead of 2.0 percent, due to no growth in sugarcane and lower growth in other agricultural activities.\nMauritius, which markets itself as a bridge between Africa and Asia, has been working to shift the economy from reliance on sugar, textiles and tourism towards offshore banking, business outsourcing, luxury real estate and medical tourism.
