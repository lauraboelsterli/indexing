    "text": "WASHINGTON, March 6 (Reuters) - North Korea has earned U.S. skepticism for breaking all previous agreements over its nuclear program but the Trump administration is open-minded about potential talks with Pyongyang, a senior administration official said on Tuesday.\nHe said the United States was looking for concrete steps toward North Koreaâ€™s denuclearization and that the U.S. posture toward the country would not change until those steps were visible.\nThe official, speaking to reporters on a conference call and on condition of anonymity, said it was natural that U.S. military exercises would resume with the conclusion of the Olympics that were held in South Korea.\nReporting by Jeff Mason and Ayesha Rascoe; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ",
