(NYSE: LFGR), a diversified consumer internet company comprised of several marketplace and media properties, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\n“We are very pleased with our performance in 2017. In Q4, our Media business achieved year-over-year revenue growth for the first time in over four years,” said Sean Moriarty, CEO of Leaf Group. “Our Marketplaces business continues to deliver consistent results with revenue increasing 24% in Q4 year-over-year.”\nFinancial Summary\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nThree months ended Year ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Marketplaces revenue $ 28,065 $ 22,618 $ 84,126 $ 66,139 Media revenue 11,662 11,371 44,864 47,313 Total revenue $ 39,727 $ 33,989 $ 128,990 $ 113,452 Net loss $ (5,333 ) $ (6,220 ) $ (31,133 ) $ (2,011 ) EPS - basic and diluted $ (0.26 ) $ (0.31 ) $ (1.52 ) $ (0.10 ) Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ (430 ) $ (2,637 ) $ (10,674 ) $ (15,020 ) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (145 ) $ 385 $ (11,656 ) $ (13,093 ) Free cash flow (1) $ (1,815 ) $ (445 ) $ (16,908 ) $ (16,082 ) (1) These non-GAAP financial measures are described below and reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in the accompanying tables. Q4 2017 Financial Summary:\n“We continue to build positive momentum in the business and focus on delivering strong operating results,” said Jantoon Reigersman, CFO of Leaf Group. “With the successful completion of our follow-on offering in February 2018, we head in to 2018 well-positioned to execute on our long-term commitment to build a sustainable and profitable business.”\nLeaf Group is comprised of two segments: Marketplaces and Media.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017:\nTotal revenue increased 17% year-over-year due to a 24% increase in Marketplaces revenue and a 3% increase in Media revenue. Marketplaces revenue grew 24% year-over-year driven by the acquisition of Deny Designs in May 2017, higher average order value and increased conversion. Media revenue increased by 3% year-over-year driven primarily by increased traffic and higher monetization on Livestrong.com , offset by the wind down of the lower-margin custom content business in Q2 2016. Net loss was $(5.3) million for the quarter and Adjusted EBITDA was $(0.4) million for the quarter, reflecting year-over-year improvements from lower Media operating expenses, including from the realignment of the lower-margin custom content business, and revenue growth in both Marketplaces and Media. Cash and cash equivalents was $31.3 million at period end with no debt outstanding. In February 2018, Leaf Group successfully completed its underwritten registered public offering of 3,373,332 shares of its common stock, including full exercise of the underwriter’s option to purchase additional shares of common stock, at a public offering price of $7.50 per share, for net proceeds of approximately $23.3 million.\nBusiness Highlights:\nOn a consolidated basis, Leaf Group’s properties reached over 50 million average monthly unique visitors in the U.S. during Q4 (source: Oct – Dec 2017 U.S. comScore). On a consolidated basis, Society6 and Deny Designs revenue grew 21% in Q4 on a year-over-year basis. Revenue growth was driven the acquisition of Deny Designs and price optimization efforts on Society6, which contributed to an increase in average order value of 17%. Deny Designs continues to focus on further strategic integration with Society6 and strengthening its position within the wholesale channel through expanding relationships with key retail partners. Saatchi Art, inclusive of The Other Art Fair, saw revenue grow 56% year-over-year in Q4 driven by an increase in the number of fairs hosted during the quarter, improving traffic and average order value, and a higher commission rate on Saatchi Art. The shifts in strategy made to the Media business over the past year and a half continued to produce positive results with Media revenue increasing 3% in Q4 on a year-over-year basis, marking the first quarter of year-over-year revenue growth in over four years. Livestrong.com revenue grew 28% year-over-year in Q4, driven primarily by higher monetization and an increase in visits of 25%. Revenue from eHow and the vertical properties that leverage content and topics formerly on eHow grew 11% year-over-year in Q4 driven primarily by an increase in visits of 29%.\nOperating Metrics:\nThree months ended Year ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 %\nChange 2017 2016 %\nChange Marketplaces Metrics: (1) Number of Transactions (2) 501,448 456,406 10 % 1,448,211 1,185,272 22 % Average Revenue per Transaction (3) $ 54.19 $ 48.65 11 % $ 56.98 $ 55.38 3 % Media Metrics: (4) Visits (5) (in thousands) 697,221 647,324 8 % 2,794,244 2,729,990 2 % Revenue per Visit (RPV) (6) $ 16.73 $ 17.57 (5 ) % $ 16.06 $ 17.33 (7 ) % Video Views (7) (in thousands) 215,463 136,023 58 % 820,568 638,277 29 % Social Metrics (in thousands): Social Media Followers - Marketplaces (1)(8) 2,757 2,074 33 % 2,757 2,074 33 % Social Media Followers - Media (8) 15,036 12,339 22 % 15,036 12,339 22 % (1) Marketplaces Metrics and Social Media Followers for prior periods have been revised to conform to current period presentation to include The Other Art Fair acquired in July 2016.

These non-GAAP financial measures are presented to enhance the user’s overall understanding of Leaf Group’s financial performance and should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release, together with the GAAP financial results, are the primary measures used by the company’s management and board of directors to understand and evaluate the company’s financial performance and operating trends, including period-to-period comparisons, because they exclude certain expenses and gains that management believes are not indicative of the company’s core operating results. Management also uses these measures to prepare and update the company’s short and long term financial and operational plans, to evaluate investment decisions, and in its discussions with investors, commercial bankers, equity research analysts and other users of the company’s financial statements. Accordingly, the company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the company’s operating results in the same manner as the company’s management and in comparing operating results across periods and to those of Leaf Group’s peer companies.\nThe use of non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations because they do not reflect all items of income and expense, or cash flows, that affect the company’s financial performance and operations. An additional limitation of non-GAAP financial measures is that they do not have standardized meanings, and therefore other companies, including peer companies, may use the same or similarly named measures but exclude or include different items or use different computations. Management compensates for these limitations by reconciling these non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures in the tables captioned “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” included at the end of this release. Investors and others are encouraged to review the company’s financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure.\nThe company defines Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) as net income (loss) excluding interest (income) expense, income tax expense (benefit), and certain other non-cash or non-recurring items impacting net income (loss) from time to time, principally comprised of depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and acquisition, disposition and realignment costs. Management believes that the exclusion of certain expenses and gains in calculating Adjusted EBITDA provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of the company’s underlying core revenue and operating costs that is focused more closely on the current costs necessary to operate the company’s businesses, and reflects its ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful analysis of trends. Management also believes that excluding certain non-cash charges can be useful because the amounts of such expenses is the result of long-term investment decisions made in previous periods rather than day-to-day operating decisions.\nThe company defines Segment Operating Contribution as net income (loss) excluding corporate or unallocated expenses, interest (income) expense, income tax expense (benefit), and certain other non-cash or non-recurring items impacting net income (loss) from time to time, principally comprised of depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation. Management believes that the exclusion of certain expenses and gains in calculating Segment Operating Contribution provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of the segment’s underlying revenue and operating costs that is focused more closely on the current costs necessary to operate the segment, and reflects the segment’s ongoing business in a manner that allows for meaningful analysis of trends. Management also believes that excluding certain non-cash charges can be useful because the amounts of such expenses is the result of long-term investment decisions made in previous periods rather than day-to-day operating decisions.\nThe company defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities net of cash flows from acquisition, disposition and realignment activities; capital expenditures to acquire property and equipment; and purchases of intangible assets. Management believes that Free Cash Flow provides investors with useful information to measure operating liquidity because it reflects the company’s underlying cash flows from recurring operating activities after investing in capital assets and intangible assets. Free Cash Flow is used by management, and may also be useful for investors, to assess the company’s ability to generate cash flow for a variety of strategic opportunities, including reinvesting in its businesses, pursuing new business opportunities and potential acquisitions, paying dividends and repurchasing shares.\nAbout Leaf Group\nLeaf Group Ltd.

If an acquisition or divestiture were consummated, actual results could differ materially from any forward-looking statements.
