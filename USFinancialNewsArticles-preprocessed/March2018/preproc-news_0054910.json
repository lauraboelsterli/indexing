    "text": "Tobias Harris made five 3-pointers as part of a 27-point effort to help the Los Angeles Clippers post a 111-99 victory over the host Phoenix Suns on Wednesday night.\nAustin Rivers contributed 18 points, eight assists and three steals as Los Angeles defeated Phoenix for the eighth straight time and 17th time in the past 19 meetings. DeAndre Jordan recorded 13 points and 15 rebounds, Lou Williams also scored 13 points, Tyrone Wallace added 12 points, seven rebounds and three steals and Montrezl Harrell had 10 points for the Clippers.\nThe victory moved Los Angeles within one game of the Utah Jazz for the eighth and final Western Conference playoff spot.\nTyler Ulis scored 23 points and Josh Jackson added 18 for the Suns, who lost a 13th consecutive contest and fell for the 28th time in 30 games. Shaquille Harrison had 17 points and four steals, Troy Daniels tallied 15 points and Marquese Chriss had 12 points, 13 rebounds and three steals.\nThe Suns were without shooting guard Devin Booker (hand) for the sixth straight game and small forward TJ Warren (knee) for the fifth consecutive contest.\nThe Clippers shot 53.8 percent from the field and held a 51-39 rebounding edge. Phoenix shot 43.2 percent from the field.\nLos Angeles pulled away with an 18-0 run to open the fourth quarter to turn a three-point margin into a 103-82 lead. Rivers scored three consecutive baskets in a 56-second span to make it 95-82 with 9:03 left, and C.J. Williams ended the surge with a 3-pointer with 6:52 to play.\nThe Clippers’ lead topped out at 22 points as they won for the 14th time in their past 21 road games.\nHarris scored 15 points in the third quarter, which ended with the Clippers holding an 85-82 advantage.\nHarris drained back-to-back 3-pointers to start a 10-0 burst as Los Angeles took a 70-59 lead with 7:52 remaining in the quarter. The margin was 10 five minutes later before Daniels knocked down consecutive 3-pointers to pull Phoenix within 80-76 with 2:17 left.\nJackson’s dunk got the Suns within 85-82 with 27.8 seconds left in the third quarter. Phoenix then missed all seven shots in the first 5:37 of the fourth quarter before Chriss scored on an alley-oop pass from Ulis.\nHarris and Wallace scored 12 points apiece in the first half as the Clippers held a 58-56 lead at the break.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
