    "text": "ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss engineering company ABB ( ABBN.S ) is considering making acquisitions, particularly in artificial intelligence, Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer said on Thursday.\nChief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer of Swiss power technology and automation group ABB gestures as he addresses the company's annual shareholder meeting in Zurich, Switzerland, March 29, 2018. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann “We will continually further expand the portfolio of ABB,” he said, speaking on the sidelines of the company’s annual general meeting in Zurich.\nThis would include investment in organic growth in artificial intelligence (AI), and partnerships with other companies to accelerate areas like linking AI to industrial robots.\nABB, whose products also include charging stations for electric cars and massive converters for continent-spanning transmission systems, would also invest selectively in start-up companies, Spiesshofer said.\nReporting by John Revill, editing by John Miller\n ",
