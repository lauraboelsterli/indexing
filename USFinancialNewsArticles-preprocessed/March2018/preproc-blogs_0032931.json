    "text": " 50 p.m. ET Share \nOil giant may list only on Saudi exchange AFP/Getty Images A Saudi Aramco natural gas and oil production plant in Saudi Arabia's remote Empty Quarter. \nBy Summer Said Maureen Farrel \nSaudi Arabia is scaling back its ambitions for a public offering for oil giant Aramco, moving ahead with a listing next year solely on the Saudi stock exchange while taking more time to decide if an international venue is worth it, government officials and others close to the process say. \nThe decision has come in part because of concerns about legal risks and also because the need for a bigger listing has been negated by rising oil prices. \nAramco’s listing was expected to raise as much as $100 billion on an international arena like New York — a move that also got the support of President Donald Trump, who publicly called for Aramco to list in the U.S. \nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who runs the day-to-day affairs of the oil-rich kingdom has become resigned to the idea that the legal risks of a U.S. listing could be insurmountable, said Saudi officials and people close to the process.",
