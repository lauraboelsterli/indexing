    "text": "SINGAPORE, March 26 (Reuters) - Ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies Inc has agreed to sell its Southeast Asian business to bigger regional rival Grab, the firms said in a statement on Monday, marking the U.S. company’s second retreat from an Asian market.\nAs part of the transaction, Uber will take a stake of 27.5 percent in the Southeast Asian company, Grab said in a statement.\nExpectations of consolidation in Asia’s fiercely competitive ride-hailing industry were stoked after Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp made a multi-billion dollar investment in Uber.
