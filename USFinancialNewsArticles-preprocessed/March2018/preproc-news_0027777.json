    "text": "March 14, 2018 / 9:49 PM / Updated 32 minutes ago Toys 'R' Us could shut all U.S. stores, risking 33,000 jobs- WSJ Reuters Staff 1 Min Read March 14 (Reuters) - Toys ‘R’ Us Inc will sell or close all its U.S. stores in the coming months, risking up to 33,000 jobs, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. The announcement was made to workers by Chief Executive David Brandon at the toy-store chain's Wayne, New Jersey headquarters, the Journal said on.wsj.com/2tPultm. The closure of Toys ‘R’ Us would be a blow to generations of consumers and hundreds of toy makers that sold their products at the chain’s 885 U.S. locations, including Barbie maker Mattel Inc, board game company Hasbro Inc and other large vendors such as Lego.
