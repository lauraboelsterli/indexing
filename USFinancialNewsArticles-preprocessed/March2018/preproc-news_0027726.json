    "text": "NEW YORK, March 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mustang Bio, Inc. (“Mustang”) (NASDAQ:MBIO), a Fortress Biotech (NASDAQ:FBIO) Company focused on the development of novel immunotherapies based on proprietary chimeric antigen receptor engineered T cell (CAR T) technology, today announced that Sadik Kassim, Ph.D., has been appointed Chief Scientific Officer, and Knut Niss, Ph.D., has been named Chief Technology Officer.\nManuel Litchman, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Mustang, said, “I’m thrilled to announce the promotion of Sadik and Knut into these key leadership roles. Sadik and Knut were among the first to join the Mustang team and have played an integral role in the development and execution of R&D, manufacturing and process development strategies that will enable Mustang to advance our pipeline of differentiated CAR T therapies. I look forward to working with Sadik and Knut in these new positions as we build out our first cell processing facility to be fully operational this year, and we continue to explore opportunities to leverage best-in-class science to strengthen our CAR T pipeline.”\nDr. Kassim joined Mustang in March 2017 as Vice President of Process and Analytical Development, where he led process development, analytical development and manufacturing strategy for Mustang’s CAR T therapies and oversaw preclinical research and pipeline expansion activities. Prior to Mustang, Dr. Kassim was Head of Analytical Development for Novartis’ Cell and Gene Therapies Unit, where he played a key role in the Biologics License Application filing for Kymriah™ (CD19 CAR T) in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Earlier in his career, Dr. Kassim was a research biologist in the Surgery Branch at the National Cancer Institute, where he was involved in early research that led to the development of Kite’s Yescarta™ (CD19 CAR T) for lymphoma, held a senior research position in the Discovery Immunology Group at The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson and was a research fellow in the University of Pennsylvania’s (Penn) Gene Therapy Program. Dr. Kassim holds a Ph.D. in microbiology and immunology from Louisiana State University School of Medicine, and a B.S. in ecology and evolutionary biology, as well as in cell and molecular biology, from Tulane University.\nDr. Niss joined Mustang in March 2017 as Vice President of Operations, where he initiated and oversees the establishment of Mustang’s cell therapy manufacturing facility. Prior to Mustang, Dr. Niss was Cell Therapy Asset Leader at Biogen, where he oversaw CMC-related activities for gene-edited hematopoietic stem cell and lentiviral gene therapy programs for sickle cell disease and hemophilia, respectively. Earlier in his career, Dr. Niss was Senior Technical Project Leader at Novartis’ cell therapy manufacturing facility in Morris Plains, New Jersey, where he directed the transfer and implementation of the CTL019 process from Penn to Novartis. He also served as Senior R&D Program Manager at EMD Millipore, where he established processes for the large-scale expansion of adult and pluripotent stem cells. Dr. Niss began his career in senior research positions in Pfizer’s Regenerative Medicine and Immunology groups. He holds a Ph.D. in molecular biology from Humboldt University of Berlin, and an M.S. in microbiology from the University of Göttingen in Germany. Dr. Niss completed his postdoctoral research at Boston Children’s Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.\nAbout Mustang Bio\nMustang Bio, Inc.
