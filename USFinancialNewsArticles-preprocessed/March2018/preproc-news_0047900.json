    "text": "  6:50 a.m. ET Share \nBrookfield would pay $9.25 billion in cash plus stock \nBy Maria Armental Miriam Gottfried \nBrookfield Property Partners LP and GGP Inc. have reached an agreement for Brookfield to buy the remaining shares of the mall owner it doesn’t already own, a deal that would create one of the world’s largest retail real-estate companies. \nThe deal is a sweetened version of the offer that Brookfield made for the roughly 66% stake in November. Brookfield currently owns about 34% of the company, formerly known as General Growth Properties. GGP, +0.28% \nUnder the agreement announced Monday, and unanimously endorsed by a special committee of GGP’s board, GGP investors could choose either $23.50 a share in cash or stock in either Brookfield Property or a new real-estate investment trust being formed. The offer is subject to proration based on aggregate cash consideration of $9.25 billion. \nEarlier, Brookfield had offered $23 a share in cash for an aggregate cash consideration of $7.4 billion. \nThe offer went from about 50% cash and 50% shares to about 61% cash and 39% shares. The previous offer valued one share of GGP with 0.9656 of Brookfield. The new offer values the two shares equally. The deal values GGP at $15.3 billion based on the value of Brookfield Property when the company first announced its offer to buy the company in November.",
