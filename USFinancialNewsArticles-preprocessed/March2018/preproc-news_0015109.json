    "text": "BERLIN, March 8 (Reuters) - German fashion house Hugo Boss said it expected sales growth to accelerate in 2018 and net income to rise as a brand overhaul to appeal to younger consumers and efforts to improve its ecommerce offering gained traction.\nHugo Boss, which already reported a 5 percent increase in currency-adjusted sales in the fourth-quarter, said net income in the period fell by 29 percent to 45 million euros ($55.84 million), missing average analyst forecasts for 59 million.\nHowever, it forecast sales and net profit to rise in a low to mid single-digit percentage range in 2018, while it expects to increase capital expenditure to between 170 million euros and 190 million from 128 million in 2017.\nAfter a string of profit warnings, the maker of slick menâ€™s suits has been slashing prices in China, adding more casual and sportswear to appeal to younger customers, investing in its website and closing loss-making stores.
