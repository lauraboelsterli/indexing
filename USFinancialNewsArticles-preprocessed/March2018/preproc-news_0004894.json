    "text": "EditorsNote: adds Field Level Media tag line\nThe Golden State Warriors overcame a Stephen Curry injury and a frantic finish Friday night to defeat the Atlanta Hawks, 114-109, and sweep their three-game Eastern trip.\nThe win was the Warriors’ 13th in 14 road games against Eastern Conference opponents this season and completed their fourth unbeaten trip of three or more games.\nGolden State had to finish the game without Curry, who aggravated his previously injured right ankle late in the first quarter.\nAfter going to the locker room for an examination, Curry returned to play in both the second and third quarters, but he was pulled from the game for good with 6:24 to go in the third.\nHe had 28 points in 24 minutes, helping the Warriors hold a 73-65 lead at the time of his exit.\nGolden State barely held on despite leading 111-100 with just 2:18 to go.\nAtlanta got within 112-109 and had possession with 18.5 seconds left, but Warriors veteran Andre Iguodala stole the ball from Kent Bazemore and went in for a game-clinching dunk.\nBazemore had a game-high 29 points for the Hawks, who were seeking their first two-game winning streak since beating New York and Memphis on Feb. 4 and Feb. 6.\nAided by a 10-point run to open the second quarter, one in which reserve Nick Young contributed eight points, the Warriors built as much as a 12-point lead in the first half.\nGolden State extended the margin to 15 in the third period before the Hawks rallied within 90-84 by period’s end.\nKlay Thompson hit a 3-pointer to help Golden State go up 101-87 with 7:06 left, but the Hawks rallied to create the exciting finish.\nCurry had four 3-pointers and hit all eight of his free throws. Kevin Durant matched Curry’s 28-point total on 12-for-19 shooting, while Young finished with 16 points and Thompson added 15.\nGolden State’s Draymond Green recorded team highs in rebounds (seven) and assists (nine) and scored two points. The Warriors connected on 11 of their 31 3-point attempts while earning their sixth straight victory over the Hawks.\nDennis Schroder backed Bazemore’s 29 points with 27 for the Hawks, who hit 15 of 35 3-point attempts.\nSchroder also recorded a team-high nine assists.\nJohn Collins added 16 points and a game-high eight rebounds, and Taurean Prince had 15 points for Atlanta, which has a far better record against Western Conference teams this season (10-13) than Eastern clubs (9-31).\n—Field Level Media\n ",
