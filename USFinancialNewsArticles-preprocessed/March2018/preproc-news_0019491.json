FILE PHOTO - The Sinopec logo is seen at one of its gas stations in Hong Kong April 26, 2010. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo State-owned Sinopec was competing for the assets with commodities trader and miner Glencore, which swooped in last October with a $973 million (705 million pounds) bid following delays to Sinopec’s original agreement.
