    "text": "PEABODY, Mass., March 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Analogic Corporation (Nasdaq:ALOG), enabling the world's medical imaging and aviation security technology, today announced results for its second quarter ended January 31, 2018.\nHighlights during the second quarter included:\nRevenue of $129.2 million with gross margin of 44% GAAP operating margin of 12%; Non-GAAP operating margin of 15% GAAP diluted EPS of $0.52; Non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.27 Operating cash flow of $21 million\nRevenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $129.2 million, a decrease of 2% compared with revenue of $131.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $6.5 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, compared with net income of $7.5 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Included in GAAP net income and diluted EPS for the second quarter of 2018 is a provisional $6.5 million income tax expense, or $0.51 per diluted share, for the one-time transition tax associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that was recently signed into law. Also included in GAAP net income and diluted EPS for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 were one-time net charges of $2.2 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, in connection with our Oncura veterinary business.\nNon-GAAP net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $16.0 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, compared with $12.6 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, in the prior year's second quarter. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included as an attachment to this press release.\nFor the first six months of fiscal 2018, revenue totaled $236.0 million, down 7% from the same period in the prior fiscal year. Fiscal year-to-date GAAP net income was $12.2 million, or $0.97 per diluted share, compared with net income of $10.0 million, or $0.79 per diluted share, from the same period in 2017. Included in GAAP net income and diluted EPS for the first six months of 2018 is a provisional $6.5 million income tax expense, or $0.51 per diluted share, for the one-time transition tax associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that was recently signed into law. Included in year-to-date fiscal 2017 GAAP net income and diluted EPS were one-time net charges of $2.3 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in connection with our Oncura veterinary business.\nYear-to-date non-GAAP net income was $25.3 million, or $2.01 per diluted share, compared with $18.0 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, in the same period last year. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included as an attachment to this press release.\nFred Parks, president and CEO, commented, “We continue to pursue our previously announced strategic sale process. In view of the status of that process, we are not commenting on our fiscal year guidance or other forward-looking performance measures.”\nSegment Revenues for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2018\nMedical Imaging segment revenue was $63.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, down 12% from revenue of $72.4 million in the same period of fiscal 2017, primarily due to lower sales in CT associated with previously reported customer sourcing decisions combined with lower sales in MR offset by favorability in Motion Controls.\nUltrasound segment revenue was $43.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, up 8% from revenue of $40.3 million in the same period of fiscal 2017, due to the strong sales growth in North America and Europe. Revenue was partially offset by the comparative lower revenue from discontinued Oncura veterinary system sales.\nSecurity and Detection segment revenue was $22.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, up 18% from revenue of $18.8 million in the same period of fiscal 2017 mainly driven by strong demand for international high-speed threat detection systems and increased revenue in Rapid DNA.\nQuarterly Cash Dividend\nOn March 1, 2018, Analogic's Board of Directors declared a $0.10 cash dividend for each common share for its second fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2018. The cash dividend will be payable on March 26, 2018, to shareholders of record on March 15, 2018.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe supplement our GAAP financial reporting with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP other income and expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. These measures are not presented in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for, U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. The non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. We have included at the end of this document a reconciliation of each historical non-GAAP financial measure used in this document to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nWe utilize a number of different financial measures, both GAAP and non-GAAP, in analyzing and assessing the overall performance of our business, in making operating decisions, in forecasting and planning for future periods, and in determining payments under our compensation programs. We also believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results and in comparing financial results across accounting periods and to those of other companies.\nForward-Looking Statements\nAny statements about future expectations, plans, and prospects for the Company, including statements containing the words \"believes,\" \"anticipates,\" \"plans,\" \"expects,\" and similar expressions, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including risks relating to product development and commercialization, limited demand for the Company's products, limited number of customers, risks associated with competition, uncertainties associated with regulatory agency approvals, competitive pricing pressures, downturns in the economy, the risk of potential intellectual property litigation, acquisition related risks, and other factors discussed in our most recent quarterly and annual reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the forward-looking statements included in this presentation represent the Company's views as of the date of this document. While the Company anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause the Company's views to change, the Company specifically disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing the Company's views as of any later date.\nConference Call Details\nAnalogic will conduct an investor conference call on Monday, March 5, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. (ET) to discuss the second quarter results.

Note 2: During fiscal years 2017 and 2018, we incurred acquisition costs related to the Ultrasonix Medical Corporation, PocketSonics, Inc., and Oncura Partners Diagnostics, LLC acquisitions, which we closed on March 2, 2013, September 20, 2013, and January 8, 2016, respectively.

Additionally, during the three and six months ended January 31, 2018, we incurred $0 of pre-tax inquiry-related costs, associated with the BK matter, as initially disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2011. This matter relates to transactions we identified involving our Danish subsidiary, BK Medical, and certain of its foreign distributors, regarding compliance with the law.\nNote 4: During the three and six months ended January 31, 2018, we incurred pre-tax charges of $197 thousand and $731 thousand, respectively, primarily due to facility exit costs associated with exiting the Vancouver facility.\nNote 5: As a result of continuing losses in the Oncura business and the related business outlook, the Company evaluated the net realizability of all of the related assets at December 31, 2016. As a result, the company recorded a pre-tax asset impairment charge of $10.4 million, primarily associated with the write-down of the Oncura goodwill to its estimated fair values. Note 6: The quarter to date Q2 FY 2018 non-GAAP tax rate differs from the GAAP tax rate primarily due to the transition tax impact from the 2017 Tax Reform Bill, acquisition related adjustments and stock compensation expenses.
