Portuguese chocolatier Daniel Gomes prepares a candy wrapped in pure 23 carat gold during international chocolate fair in Obidos Portugal, March 16, 2018. REUTERS/Rafael Marchante Priced at 7,728 euros ($9,489) each and covered in edible gold, the limited edition of 1,000 bonbons was guarded by two uniformed men.
