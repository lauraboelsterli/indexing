    "text": "March 30, 2018 / 5:48 PM / Updated 13 minutes ago Baker Hughes GE's CEO of Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea departs Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nMarch 30 (Reuters) - Mary Hackett has left her job as chief executive officer of Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea for General Electric’s Baker Hughes oilfield services firm, a company spokeswoman confirmed on Friday. \nHackett left the position this month, according to an update on her LinkedIn profile. \nHackett had served in that position since November 2014, according to her profile. She previously was senior vice president of Australia Oil for Woodside Energy. \nThe spokeswoman confirmed the departure and said Visal Leng, president and CEO for Asia Pacific, continues to oversee the region. She did not provide a reason for Hackett’s departure. \nBaker Hughes GE in August announced an agreement with Twinza Oil Limited to provide services and equipment for development of the Pasca A gas condensate field, located in the Gulf of Papua off Papua New Guinea. \nHackett did not respond to a request for comment.
