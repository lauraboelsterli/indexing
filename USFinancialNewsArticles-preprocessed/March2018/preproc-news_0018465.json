    "text": "OPEC, Russia and other non-OPEC nations are likely to turn their production-cutting deal into a longer-term relationship to help fend off the next downturn and make the oil market less volatile. \nThe agreement to reduce oil output by 1.8 million barrels a day extends through the end of the year, and multiple ministers endorsed retaining a relationship that could help prevent another destabilizing collapse in oil prices, like the one in 2015 and 2016.\n\"We realized it was a negative sum game; all of us producers and consumers were losing when the oil price went down,\" said Mohammed Saleh Abdullah Al-Sada, Qatar Minister of Energy and Industry. Al-Sada, speaking at IHS Markit's annual CERAWeek conference, was instrumental in bringing fellow OPEC ministers into agreement on a deal in 2016, when they met on the sidelines of an industry conference in Algeria.\n\"A year earlier we opened channels with Russia, and again we found they were thinking alike,\" he said. \"We found once we agreed among ourselves, Russia was very positive.\"\nThe thorn in the side of major oil-producing nations has been U.S. shale, which started to boom in the last decade as the industry applied and continued to improve new technologies. The message from CERAWeek was that OPEC will continue to hold the market steady, for now.\nOPEC and Russia motivations may ultimately diverge While OPEC and Russia agreed to cut back, shale drillers are driven purely by economics and they increased production as prices stabilized. Now at record oil production of more than 10 million barrels a day, the United States is ahead of Saudi Arabia since it pared back production.\n\"Russia and OPEC have a major problem in the long run. The fact that the Saudis are pegging to the U.S. dollar and the Russians have a floating currency means in the long run the Saudis want more dollars and the Russians want more barrels,\" said Francisco Blanch, head of global commodities and derivatives research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\n\"It's worked out well for the last year and a half, and they are investing in each other's countries,\" he said recently. \"At the end of the day, if the Russians extend the deal into 2020, they lose more market share to the U.S., and I don't think they're willing to do that.\"\nSaudi Aramco CEO on relationship with Russia      11:00 AM ET Tue, 6 March 2018 | 03:04",
