    "text": "LAS VEGAS, March 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Remark Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MARK), a diversified global technology company with leading artificial intelligence (AI) solutions and digital media properties, including Vegas.com , reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nManagement Commentary\n\"We are pleased to announce our increased guidance today as our businesses continue to outperform our initial expectations,\" said Kai-Shing Tao, the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"In 2017, our FinTech business generated our first significant revenue amounts from our KanKan operations, and we have quickly been able to monetize KanKan's other AI technologies as evidenced by our recent successes in securing significant contracts.\"\n\"Here in Las Vegas, our Vegas.com operations continue to do well, primarily driven by increases in show ticket sales, and we look forward to what 2018 will bring with new product enhancements to our offerings,\" concluded Mr. Tao.\nThree-Month and Twelve-Month 2017 Financial Results\nNet revenue for the quarter was $18.6 million, a 24% increase year-over-year. Net revenue for 2017 was $70.6 million, a 19% increase year-over-year. The company's quarterly and full year financial results include Fanstang, which the company acquired in September 2016 and which was only a nominal part of the company's financial results for the same periods of 2016.\nThree Months Ended December 31st: 2017 Compared to 2016\nNet revenue was $18.6 million, compared to $15.0 million. Total cost and expense was $40.0 million, compared to $24.7 million. Operating loss was $21.4 million, compared to $9.7 million. Net loss was $89.2 million, or $3.47 per diluted share, compared to $8.6 million, or $0.40 per diluted share. Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 included a $66.5 million non-cash charge related to a change in the fair value of the company's warrant liability, which occurred as a result of the significant increase in the company's stock price during the period. For the fourth quarter of 2016, the company recorded a $3.1 million gain related to the change in the fair value of the company's warrant liability during the period. At December 31, 2017, the cash and cash equivalents balance was $22.6 million, and total restricted cash was $11.7 million, bringing the total combined cash position to $34.3 million, compared to a total combined cash position of $18.5 million at December 31, 2016.\nTwelve Months Ended December 31st: 2017 Compared to 2016\nNet revenue was $70.6 million, compared to $59.3 million. Total cost and expense was $108.0 million, compared to $81.9 million. Operating loss was $37.4 million, compared to $22.6 million. Operating loss for 2017 included a $14.6 million non-cash charge related to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets purchased from China Branding Group Limited (including Fanstang) in September 2016. Net loss was $106.7 million, or $4.49 per diluted share, compared to $31.7 million, or $1.54 per diluted share. Net loss for 2017 included a $64.1 million non-cash charge related to the change in the fair value of the company's warrant liability, compared to a $5.8 million gain recorded for 2016.\n2018 Financial Outlook\nThe company increased its limited guidance regarding certain revenue and EBITDA expectations.\nFor 2018, company management expects to generate consolidated net revenue in excess of $120 million. KanKan's Artificial Intelligence Platform will be the primary driver of the growth as its revenue rapidly increases. For the year ending December 31, 2018, management expects KanKan to generate more than $50 million in net revenue.\nRemark Holdings management also indicated it expects its travel & entertainment segment to generate gross revenue of more than $375 million and net revenue between approximately $70 million to $80 million, with an EBITDA margin approximating 12% to 15% of net revenue, during 2018.\nConference Call Information\nMr. Tao and Remark Holdings' CFO Douglas Osrow will hold a conference call today (March 29, 2018) at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (5:30 a.m. Pacific Time) to discuss these financial results.
