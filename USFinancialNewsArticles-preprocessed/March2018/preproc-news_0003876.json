It also topped the box office, grossing $377 million domestically.\nThe third installment of ‘The Lord of the Rings’ took home the biggest prize at the Oscars in 2004. Photo: Everett Collection Its success with both moviegoers and Oscar voters was no fluke: Between 1983 and 2005, every best picture winner was among the 25 highest-grossing releases during the year it opened. Often they were among the top two, including such hits as “Titanic,” “ Forrest Gump, ” “Rain Man” and “Terms of Endearment.”\nThat string was broken in 2006 when “Crash” won best picture but came in No. 49 at the box office. That started a new streak in which just four of the last 12 best picture winners have been among their year’s 25 highest-grossing releases, and none has ranked higher than No. 15.\nThe Academy Awards are meant to be a lovefest celebrating the very best Hollywood has to offer. But the disconnect between its 7,000-plus voters and the moviegoing public signals the love-hate relationship the film industry has with its audiences and even itself. The result is that the most prestigious movie prize there is, an awards show meant to unite the public around a shared love for the big screen, is becoming increasingly irrelevant. \nThe only best-picture nominee in 2018 that could improve on the dismal record of the past 12 years would do it by a hair: “Dunkirk,” a long shot for Sunday’s top prize, was the 14th highest-grossing movie of 2017. Leading contenders “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,” “The Shape of Water” and “Get Out” are currently ranked 55, 50, and 15, respectively.\nWorld War II epic ‘Dunkirk’ is one of this year’s nominees for best picture. Photo: Warner Bros. Pictures It isn’t coincidence that the era of low-grossing Oscar winners has also been the era of the franchise film, during which superheroes, Jedi knights , physics-defying cars and remakes of films you loved 25 years ago have come to dominate the box office. Those types of movies are overwhelmingly what audiences prefer, particularly outside the U.S.\nThat is good news for the studios that release those movies and the people who work on them. But even those buying their third Tesla with profits from the eighth “Fast & Furious” aren’t necessarily living their Hollywood dream. Many filmmakers are cinephiles who got into the business because of their love for quirky, original, low- to mid-budget dramas. \nBut such films, even when successful on their own modest financial terms, struggle to gain box-office traction. The average American sees about four movies a year, and most of those are the “event” movies that suck up much of the pop-cultural discussion, like “Black Panther,” “Wonder Woman,” and the latest “Star Wars” sequel .\nSo why do they get so little love on Oscar night? “Wonder Woman” and “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” both received overwhelmingly positive reviews, after all, garnering even higher Rotten Tomatoes scores than Academy Award nominees for best picture “The Post” and “Darkest Hour.” \nThe Academy’s voting suggests that “Wonder Woman” and “Star Wars” don’t reflect the way Hollywood sees itself—or the sensibility it tries to convey in an awards show watched by millions around the world.\nBest picture winners from years past: ‘Million Dollar Baby,’ ‘The Silence of the Lambs,’ ‘Rain Man.’ Photo: Everett Collection (3) Best, Not Biggest Over the last 10 years, the Oscar for best picture was won by movies that weren't widely seen.

Audiences turned out in droves at movie theaters to watch captivating dramas based on original scripts, because they were much easier to find there than on network television. The economics of the film business, driven by American moviegoers and healthy DVD sales, made such films profitable. \nHollywood was proud of the movies audiences loved. And so Academy voters didn’t feel bad awarding best picture to blockbusters like “Gladiator,” “The Silence of the Lambs” and “Platoon.” Or perhaps it was that audiences were eager to head to the theater and fork over their money for such high-quality pictures.\nEither way, the catastrophic decline in DVD sales, the growing importance of foreign markets like China , and moviegoers’ infatuation with cinematic brands like Marvel have brought an end to that era.\nThe divide between Oscar voters and moviegoers may only grow in the coming years as streaming services become the way more of us watch feature films . Netflix ’s entry into original motion pictures has been greeted with a mixed response at best in Hollywood, where many believe movies are made to be seen in theaters.\nIt is easy to dismiss Oscar voters as out of touch with the moviegoing public, but that didn’t suddenly become a problem in the past decade. The movie business has steadily changed, so that the films audiences adore are no longer the ones that entertainment-industry professionals think are the best they have to offer.\nThe Academy has been letting in new, younger members at a rapid clip in the past few years, which could change this dynamic. A victory for “Get Out,” considered by most Oscar analysts to be unlikely but possible, would start to bridge the gap between Hollywood and the people who fill multiplexes. Generating $176 million at the box office, the horror flick with a race-relations message was a surprise hit, though far behind last year’s blockbusters such as the “Beauty and the Beast” remake and the second “Jumanji.”\nThe best shot, though, may come in a year, when we find out whether the members of the Academy are ready to honor what is already sure to be one of 2018’s highest-grossing and best-reviewed movies: “Black Panther.” \nWrite to Ben Fritz at ben.fritz@wsj.com \nMore on the Oscars \nActors Do Double Duty in Oscar Films (March 1) Eye-Catching Costumes Rule the Oscar Race (March 1) Think You Like the Oscars?
