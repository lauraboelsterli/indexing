above table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA to income before income taxes as reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nWhen we use the term “Adjusted EBITDA,” it is referring to income before income taxes minus (a) net income attributable to non-controlling interests plus (b) depreciation and amortization, (c) interest expense, net, (d) non-cash stock compensation expense, (e) contingent acquisition compensation expense, (f) merger transaction, integration and practice acquisition costs, minus (g) gain on litigation settlement, (h) gain on acquisition escrow release, (plus)/minus (i) (loss)/gain on disposal or impairment of long-lived assets, net, minus (j) gain on amendment to tax receivable agreement, (plus)/minus (k) tax receivable agreement (expense)/benefit and plus (l) loss on debt refinancing. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by management to assess operating performance, make business decisions and allocate resources. Non-controlling interests represent the interests of third parties, such as physicians, and in some cases, healthcare systems that own an interest in surgical facilities that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes. We believe that it is helpful to investors to present Adjusted EBITDA as defined above because it excludes the portion of net income attributable to these third-party interests and clarifies for investors our portion of Adjusted EBITDA generated by our surgical facilities and other operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and evaluating our financial performance. We believes such adjustments are appropriate, as the magnitude and frequency of such items can vary significantly and are not related to the assessment of normal operating performance. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n(6) This amount includes merger transaction and integration costs of $4.5 million and $2.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and practice acquisition costs of $1.4 million and $0.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThis amount includes merger transaction and integration costs of $13.1 million and $8.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and practice acquisition costs of $3.9 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nSURGERY PARTNERS, INC.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n(Amounts in thousands, except shares and per share amounts)\nFrom time to time, the Company incurs certain non-recurring gains or losses that are normally nonoperational in nature and that it does not consider relevant in assessing its ongoing operating performance. When significant, Surgery Partners’ management and Board of Directors typically exclude these gains or losses when evaluating the Company’s operating performance and in certain instances when evaluating performance for incentive compensation purposes. Additionally, the Company believes that certain investors and equity analysts exclude these or similar items when evaluating the Company’s current or future operating performance and in making informed investment decisions regarding the Company. Accordingly, the Company provides adjusted net income per share attributable to common stockholders as a supplement to its comparable GAAP measure of net income per share attributable to common stockholders. Adjusted net income per share attributable to common stockholders should not be considered a measure of financial performance under GAAP, and the items excluded from adjusted net income per share attributable to common stockholders are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Adjusted net income per share attributable to common stockholders should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income per share attributable to common stockholders as presented in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table reconciles net income as reflected in the consolidated statements of operations to adjusted net income used to calculate adjusted net income per share attributable to common stockholders:\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31, Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Consolidated Statements of Operations Data: Net Income $ 966 $ 38,100 $ 28,736 $ 85,083 Less: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests 33,142 21,238 81,721 75,630 Amounts attributable to participating securities (6) 7,848 — 26,047 — Plus: Non-cash stock compensation expense 204 695 5,584 2,021 Contingent acquisition compensation expense 1,377 2,032 7,039 5,092 Merger transaction, integration and practice acquisition costs 5,873 3,038 17,007 11,617 Gain on litigation settlement (8,740 ) (14,101 ) (12,534 ) (14,101 ) Gain on acquisition escrow (167 ) — (1,167 ) — (Gain) loss on disposal or impairment of long-lived assets, net (328 ) 658 1,720 2,355 Gain on amendment to tax receivable agreement — — (16,392 ) Tax receivable agreement (benefit) expense (25,329 ) — (25,329 ) 3,733 Loss on debt refinancing — — 18,211 11,876 Adjusted net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders $ (67,134 ) $ 9,184 $ (84,893 ) $ 32,046 Adjusted net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders Basic $ (1.39 ) $ 0.19 $ (1.76 ) $ 0.67 Diluted (7) $ (1.39 ) $ 0.19 $ (1.76 ) $ 0.66 Weighted average common shares outstanding Basic 48,319,851 48,019,652 48,187,844 48,018,944 Diluted (7) 48,319,851 48,217,454 48,187,844 48,190,738 (6) Includes accrued dividends of $7.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Includes accrued dividends of $10.5 million and a mark to redemption adjustment of $15.6 million for the Series A Preferred Stock for the year ended December 31. 2017. There were no participating securities during the 2016 periods.\n(7) The impact of potentially dilutive securities for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 was not considered because the effect would be anti-dilutive in each of those periods.\nIn connection with the Preferred Private Placement and the Private Sale, as previously disclosed on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 1, 2017, the Company elected to apply “pushdown” accounting with the change of control effective August 31, 2017, by applying the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification Topic (\"ASC\") 805, Business Combinations. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements of the Company for periods before and after August 31, 2017 will reflect different bases of accounting, and the financial positions and results of operations of those periods are not comparable. Throughout the Company's consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes therein to be filed on or before March 16, 2018, periods prior to the change of control are identified as \"Predecessor\" and periods after the change of control are identified as \"Successor.\"\nThe following table reconciles the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 presented above, to the Successor and Predecessor periods:\nSuccessor Predecessor September 1 to\nDecember 31, January 1 to\nAugust 31, 2017 2017 Revenues $ 592,604 $ 748,615 Operating expenses: Salaries and benefits 175,403 241,149 Supplies 161,015 193,322 Professional and medical fees 45,061 57,931 Lease expense 27,868 36,503 Other operating expenses 32,281 43,267 Cost of revenues 441,628 572,172 General and administrative expenses (8) 29,153 46,797 Depreciation and amortization 21,804 30,124 Provision for doubtful accounts 12,455 16,297 Income from equity investments (3,319 ) (3,148 ) (Gain) loss on disposal or impairment of long-lived assets, net 5 1,715 Merger transaction and integration costs 7,470 5,584 Loss on debt refinancing — 18,211 Gain on litigation settlement (8,740 ) (3,794 ) Gain on acquisition escrow release (167 ) (1,000 ) Electronic health records incentive expense (income) 45 (305 ) Other income — (2 ) Total operating expenses 500,334 682,651 Operating income 92,270 65,964 Gain on amendment to tax receivable agreement 1,098 15,294 Tax receivable agreement benefit 25,329 — Interest expense, net (48,740 ) (68,929 ) Income before income taxes 69,957 12,329 Income tax (benefit) expense 71,639 (18,089 ) Net income (1,682 ) 30,418 Less: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests (39,634 ) (42,087 ) Net loss attributable to Surgery Partners, Inc.
