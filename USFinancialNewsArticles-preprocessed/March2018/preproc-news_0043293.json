    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif., March 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Nubeva Technologies Ltd. (\"Nubeva\" or the \"Company\") (TSX-V: NBVA), a cybersecurity SaaS software developer for enterprises with public cloud assets, announces that Nubeva, Inc., its operating company, has SEDAR filed its unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended January 31, 2018. These financial statements are for the period concluding prior to the Company's February 28, 2018 reverse takeover of Sherpa Holdings Corp. and do not represent the current consolidated financial position of the Company. The financial statements can be viewed at www.sedar.com .\nDuring the nine months ended January 31, 2018 Nubeva, Inc. Reported revenue of US$238,125 (2017 – NIL) from two customers, US$123,125 (2017 – NIL) for the most recent quarter. The Company reported a loss for the nine months of US$1,071,973 (2017 - US$302,203) and for the most recent quarter of US$522,878 (2017 - US$195,160). The increased operating loss is due to increased development costs including costs related to filing provisional patents, and also to the Company's launch of its sales and marketing campaign as Nubeva's StratusEdge software became commercially available.\nSubsequent to January 31, 2018 the Company completed its reverse takeover of a capital pool company, Sherpa Holdings Corp. and listed on the TSX Venture Exchange. In connection with the reverse takeover Nubeva raised C$10,100,020 strengthening its working capital position and providing it with the runway continue to develop its product offerings for an expanded customer base.\n\"We're pleased at the investor response to our successful C$10 million financing,\" said Randy Chou, Nubeva's CEO. \"With a strong balance sheet, major cybersecurity channel partners, and the continuing enterprise migration to unsecured cloud services, we're confident that our blockchain routing solution will continue to gain adoption beyond our current Fortune 500 client accounts.\"\nNubeva Grants Director Stock Options\nNubeva also announces that it has granted 570,600 incentive stock options to directors and employees of the Company. Nubeva granted 193,000 options (representing 0.375% of the Company's issued and outstanding common shares) to each of Mr. David Wu and Mr. David Warner, who were appointed as directors effective February 28, 2018 upon completion of the Company's reverse takeover transaction. The remaining 193,600 options were granted to a Company employee. The options granted to directors vest over 24 months in equal monthly installments and have an exercise price of $1.52 per share.
