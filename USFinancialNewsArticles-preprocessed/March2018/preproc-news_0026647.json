    "text": "March 15, 2018 / 1:11 PM / Updated 20 minutes ago Alibaba plans listing in mainland China: WSJ Reuters Staff 2 Min Read (Reuters) - E-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd ( BABA.N ) is working on a plan to list on a stock exchange in its home country, China, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. A logo of Alibaba Group is pictured at its headquarters in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province, China, October 14, 2015. REUTERS/Stringer/File photo Alibaba is evaluating ways in which its shares could be traded by investors on the mainland, the newspaper reported on.wsj.com/2peqrpb , adding that a secondary listing in China could happen as soon as this summer if the country's securities rules are changed to allow listings of foreign companies. The news of a probable listing comes a few weeks after it was reported that China may allow its offshore-listed tech giants to sell a form of shares on the mainland. Alibaba, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is one of the worldâ€™s biggest tech companies listed offshore. Others include Baidu Inc ( BIDU.O ), JD.com Inc ( JD.O ) and Tencent Holdings Ltd ( 0700.HK ). Alibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
