    "text": "LONDON, March 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Condor Gold (AIM:CNR) (OTCQX:CNDGF) (TSX:COG) is pleased to announce its audited results for the year ended 31 December 2017.\nHIGHLIGHTS\n£ 5.242M raised by way of a private placement of new ordinary shares Approximately 2,000 meters drilling on 3 scout targets completed on Real de la Cruz, Tatescame and Andrea 5,922 metre drill campaign completed at Mestiza.. The objective of the drill campaign at Mestiza is to convert an historic Soviet-era resource to NI 43-101 standard The highlight of the drill results on Mestiza is a high-grade ore shoot in the Tatiana vein. This has a strike length of 450 m and an estimated average true width of 2.2 m. The shoot can be extrapolated approximately 200 m below surface; LIDC 344, which has a drill width 3.30 m at 28.3 g/t gold, is 60 m vertically beneath surface. LIDC 358, drill width of 3.55 m at 23.3 g/t gold, is approximately 100 m vertically below LIDC 344 Soil geochemistry survey completed in August 2017 over the entire 313 km² of La India Project, included several high grade rock chip samples of over 10g/t gold, highlighting several new exploration targets Regional structural geological model updated highlighting two major basement feeder zones, La India Corridor and the Andrea Corridor, together with a linking structure in the South Significant progress made by the social team on gaining a social licence to operate Secondary trading on the OTCQX Best Market in the U.S. commenced in April 2017 Conditional approval received to dual- list the Company’s shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange\nPOST PERIOD HIGHLIGHTS\nShares of the Company were dual-listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange on 15 January 2018 Roger Davey retired from the Board after 6 years and was replaced by Andrew Cheatle, a Canadian resident and mining industry professional La India Open pit was redesigned to avoid resettlement and a corresponding amendment to the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment, which forms a key part of the application for the Environmental Permit, was submitted to the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources Redesigned open pit is not expected to materially alter a Pre-Feasibility Study open pit gold mineral reserve in the Probable category of 6.9 Mt at 3.0 g/t gold for 675,000 oz gold, producing 80,000 oz gold per annum for seven years\nCHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017\nDear Shareholder,\nI am pleased to announce Condor Gold Plc’s (“Condor” or “the Company” or “the Group”, www.condorgold.com ) annual report for the 12-month financial year to 31 December 2017. Following the release in December 2014 of a NI 43-101 technical report detailing a Pre-Feasibility Study (“PFS”) and two Preliminary Economic Assessments (“PEAs”), the Company spent 2015, 2016 and 2017 executing a twin strategy of permitting the construction and operation of a base case processing plant with capacity of up to 2,800 tonnes per day (“tpd”) capable of producing approximately 100,000 oz gold per annum and proving a major Gold District at the 313km² La India Project, Nicaragua.\nIn November 2015, Condor formally submitted a 700-page Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (“ESIA”) document, applying for an Environmental Permit to the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources, Nicaragua (“MARENA”) for the construction and operation of an open pit mine, a 2,800 tpd or 1 million tonnes per annum (“tpa”) CIL processing plant and associated infrastructure at the La India Project. The application envisaged the resettlement of approximately 330 houses or 1,000 people. The community resettlement combined with Presidential and Mayoral elections has been the reason the permit has been delayed 18 months. Overall, the Government of Nicaragua has been supportive of Condor building a new mine at the historic Mina La India.\nOn 26 February 2018, Condor announced that it had formally submitted a 130 page amendment to the ESIA to MARENA, to construct and operate a processing plant without the need to resettle approximately 330 houses or 1,000 people. This followed several months of discussions and collaborative meetings with MARENA and the Ministry of Energy and Mines (“MEM”), such that the technical components within the amended ESIA required by both Ministries were agreed in advance and submitted in the final amended application.\nThe general feedback from MEM, MARENA and local stakeholders has been that permitting will be much easier now that the mine has been redesigned to proceed without resettling 1,000 people. Condor’s technical team has redesigned La India open pit and believe it is both technically viable and economically attractive, should future funding be received, to proceed with a redesigned open pit that does not require community resettlement. It includes the relocation of the processing plant approximately 1,200 metres from the village. A 5 metre high berm is planned between the redesigned open pit and the village to reduce noise and dust pollution. Mine scheduling studies are on-going, and further details will be provided in due course. Condor does not anticipate a material change in the total ounces of gold expected to be recoverable from the redesigned open pit compared to the open pit disclosed in the PFS. The PFS details an open pit gold mineral reserve in the Probable category of 6.9 Mt at 3.0 g/t gold for 675,000 oz gold, producing 80,000 oz gold per annum for seven years.\nThe revised ESIA document considers the environmental and social impacts of gold production from the La India Open Pit mine plan, which is a single pit, detailed in the NI 43-101 compliant PFS released in December 2014 and the Whittle Enterprise Optimisation study which was finalised on 22 January 2016. The ESIA draws on data from 15 different environmental and social baseline studies, some of which commenced in 2013. In addition to describing the potential impacts of a future commercial mine on the environment, the ESIA also contains detailed environmental management plans and social management plans to monitor and control any such impacts.\nThe ESIA describes a processing plant that will have a capacity of up to 2,800 tpd 1.0 million tpa with an upfront capital cost of approximately US$120M. All-in-sustaining-cash-costs are circa US$700 per oz gold. The ESIA includes processing of an additional 10,000oz of gold p.a. from artisanal miners through the main processing plant, but the artisanal miners’ ore is excluded from the PFS, PEAs and Optimisation Studies.\nDuring 2017, SRK Consulting (UK) Ltd. completed two scoping level studies each aimed at examining the likely production scenarios in the event that the mineral resource in the 3 main vein sets of La India, America and Mestiza is increased from 2.1M oz gold to 3M oz gold. The studies conclude that the 3 vein sets could be mined simultaneously from a combination of open pit and underground mining methods and possibly double the annual production rate.\nCondor has been working on a land acquisition programme for over 4 years and plans to acquire approximately 600 hectares of rural land for the production scenario in the PFS. ProNicaragua is assisting with a clean up of land titles. During 2017, the Company purchased 150 hectares of rural land. Two independent valuations have been conducted and a strategy is being implemented to secure the rural land by paying 10% of the purchase price of land to landowners, who grant Condor an option to purchase the rural land for a two-year period. Offers to purchase the land have been made to all landowners; at the time of writing 30% have accepted.\nExploration activities during 2017 followed a dual approach of exploration or scout drilling which targeted new areas within the La India Project and regional exploration, primarily focussed on identifying targets for hidden deep-seated gold mineralisation.\nOn 31 st March 2017, Condor commenced an initial 2,000m drilling programme on Mestiza to test the historic Soviet mineral resource and went on to complete almost 6,000m drilling on Mestiza by August 2017. The aim was to convert the upper portion of the Soviet mineral resource to a NI 43-101-standard Inferred Mineral Resource. This is significant for four reasons:\nSoviet-backed drilling in 1991 supported a Soviet-style mineral resource of 2,392kt at 10.2 g/t gold for 785,694oz gold at Mestiza. Note that the Company is not treating this historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves. It is superseded by the mineral resources reported herein. Condor has used the Soviet data, and subsequent drilling undertaken by Canadian companies, to plan a drill programme to convert the upper portion of the Soviet resource to Western standards. Mestiza already hosts a NI 43-101-compliant Inferred Mineral Resource of 1,490kt at 7.47g/t for 333,000oz gold. However, this is excluded from the current PFS and PEA Studies at the La India Project. There is a high possibility of bringing additional high grade gold ore from Mestiza into a future mine plan, feeding a centralised processing plant. There is the possibility of a third feeder pit on Mestiza.\nThe Mestiza Vein Set is excluded from the PFS. It is encouraging that Micon International’s 1998 report on the Espinito-Mendoza Concession concluded that the property has good potential to become a small (500 to 800tpd), low cost mine.\nIn April 2017, Condor completed a regional soil geochemistry survey designed to look for high-level, epithermal pathfinder elements above hidden deep-seated epithermal gold mineralisation. Following the 71km² multi-element soil survey carried out in 2015 a further 109km² was completed in 2016, with the balance of the entire 313km² of the La India Project concession package completed by April 2017. The interpretation of the soil geochemistry, in conjunction with the field mapping, has highlighted several areas for follow up exploration.\nThe International Finance Corporation (“IFC”), the private sector investment body of the World Bank, was a 7.33% shareholder in the Company at 31 st December 2017. Condor is committed to complying with IFC Performance Standards, which are an international benchmark for identifying and managing environmental and social risk. Condor has put considerable time and effort into fulfilling the requirements of an Environmental Social Action Plan (ESAP), which was agreed to with the IFC as part of their investment process.\nLa India Project has now met the conditions of the agreed ESAP. The Company’s fulfilment of the ESAP items, to the satisfaction of the IFC, is establishing the basis for the sustainability of a future mine at the La India Project, whose development is subject to obtaining all required permits and compliance with IFC performance standards applicable to that stage. Implementation of the IFC Performance Standards help Condor manage and improve our environmental and social performance through an outcomes-based approach and also provide a solid base from which the company may increase the sustainability of its business operations and provides benefits for all shareholders.\nIn October 2017, Mr Aiser Sarria joined Condor Gold as General Manager, Mina La India. Mr Sarria joins Condor from B2Gold where he was Projects and Mine Superintendent at El Limon Mine, which is only 35 miles away from La India Project. He has the relevant experience of open pit and underground mining to progress Mina La India through permitting, additional technical studies and construction. In November 2017, Mr Jeffrey Karoly joined Condor Gold as Chief Financial Officer. Mr Karoly has extensive experience at CFO-level in listed companies, with a particular focus on South America since spending time there with Anglo American. He has first-hand experience of maintaining AIM/TSX dual listings and was instrumental in Condor’s dual listing on the TSX in January 2018.\nTurning to the financial results for the year 2017, the loss for the year was £3,023,615 (2016:£7,682,231). The Company raised £5.242 million during the financial period. The increase in cash and cash equivalents over the year was £362,651 (2016: increase of £141,900). The net cash balance at 31 st December 2017 was £946,261\nIn 2017, the Company announced it had raised £5.242m by way of a private placement of 8,454,733 new ordinary shares at a placement price of 62 pence. A one-half warrant, which is unlisted, was attached to each placement share. A total of 4,227,364 warrants were issued with an exercise price of 93 pence and a 2 year life. If exercised in full, the warrants would raise gross proceeds of £3,931,449\nThe twin strategy for 2018 remains to obtain the Environmental Permit for a base case of a 2,800tpd processing plant for a single open pit at La India, with the capacity to produce approximately 100,000oz gold per annum and to demonstrate a major Gold District at La India Project. On the grant of the permits, Condor envisages a 12 month study period followed by an 18 to 24 month construction period. During the 12 month study period, subject to funding, the Company has exploration drill plans targeted to add 1million ounces of gold to the global mineral resource through extensions to known mineralisation and determine whether feeder pits can be added to the PFS as well as progress the main La India open pit from PFS to FS.\nCONDOR GOLD PLC\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017\nYear Ended\n31.12.17 Year Ended\n31.12.16 £ £ Administrative expenses (3,023,953 ) (3,618,877 ) Impairment of El Salvador assets -
