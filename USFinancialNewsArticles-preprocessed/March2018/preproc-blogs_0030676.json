    "text": "Science Co-pilot sues Alaska Airlines, alleges flight captain raped her An Alaska Airlines pilot is suing the company, saying she was drugged and raped by a colleague during Minneapolis stopover last June. Betty Pina alleges that she was serving as a co-pilot and blacked out after the captain gave her wine at a hotel lounge. Published 9 Hours Ago The Associated Press Getty Images \nAn Alaska Airlines pilot is suing the company under Washington state's anti-discrimination law, claiming its response was inadequate after she says she was drugged and raped by a colleague during Minneapolis stopover last June. \nThe Seattle Times reports Betty Pina filed the lawsuit on Wednesday at the King County Superior Court. \nPina alleges that she was serving as a co-pilot and blacked out after the captain gave her wine at a hotel lounge. \nShe says she later woke up naked from the waist down in a room with him. \nIn response to a query from CNBC, an Alaska Airlines spokesperson said: \"This is an open and active investigation and we aren't going to comment. What we can say is that we are taking this matter seriously. The safety and wellbeing of our employees and guests is a top priority.\" \nThe Associated Press generally doesn't name people who say they're victims of sex crimes but Pina has spoken publicly about her case. \nâ€” CNBC's Meghan Reeder contributed to this report.",
