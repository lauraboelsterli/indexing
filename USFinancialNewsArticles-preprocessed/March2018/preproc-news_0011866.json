    "text": "BERLIN/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - The German military has excluded a consortium of ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems and Luerssen from bidding for a contract to build a new multipurpose warship, both companies said on Thursday.\nThyssenkrupp was notified of the exclusion from the tender process and was evaluating the reasons given, it said in a statement without elaborating.\nThe tender is for Germany’s new MKS 180 warship, which is one of the German military’s largest armament initiatives and designed to combat targets in the air, above and below water and to conduct land operations.\nThe military is seeking bids for the construction of four ships, with an option for an additional two. The first four would cost about 4.5 billion euros (3.98 billion pounds), according to earlier plans.\nThe German ministry of defense declined to comment on the exclusion, which was first reported by business newspaper Handelsblatt.\nReporting by Sabine Siebold and Tom Kaeckenhoff; Writing by Tom Sims; Editing by David Goodman\n ",
