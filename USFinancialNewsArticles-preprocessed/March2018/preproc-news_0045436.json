    "text": "14 COMMENTS ATLANTA—Holy Sister. Loyola-Chicago is headed to the Final Four.\nNo. 11 seed Loyola Chicago, the high-spirited and heartwarming story of this NCAA tournament, claimed its place in history with a 78-62 win over No. 9 seed Kansas State here in the Elite Eight, setting up a meeting with No. 3 seed Michigan for a spot in the championship.\nOnly three No. 11 seeds had ever made the Final Four before. Loyola-Chicago became the fourth.\nBut the Ramblers aren’t anything like any underdogs that came before them. They’re the underdog with the internationally famous 98-year-old nun named Sister Jean who serves as the team chaplain and scouts for them on the side. (Don’t call her nationally famous—she’ll correct you.) Their fans wear maroon and gold scarves that are somehow both tacky and endearing.\nAnd all of a sudden, their story doesn’t seem so shocking simply because of how well they have played all along—just without much notice until this mesmerizing run.\n“Look at this,” coach Porter Moser told the crowd after the game. “This is the way it’s supposed to be.”\nNobody else figured this was the way it’s supposed to be. Not even Sister Jean. She knew the team had upset potential, and in one of her brackets she had them reaching the Sweet 16. Then she had them losing. The players apologized for busting her bracket. She was thrilled they busted it.\nThe Loyola-Chicago Ramblers celebrate after defeating the Kansas State Wildcats. Photo: adam hagy/Reuters But everything changed even before the year even started. The Ramblers have a period before every season under coach Porter Moser for conditioning. It’s called boot camp. Usually it lasts two to three days. This year, it lasted 10.\nThe boot camp is a collection of everything basketball players love to hate. The sessions started at 5:30 a.m. They were two-a-days. The players ran sprints. Then they ran them again. They did all sorts of drills, but none of them even involved using a basketball.\n“It was so hard,” said senior forward Nick Dinardi.\nBetween then and now, something incredible happened: Loyola-Chicago, the NCAA tournament’s lovable underdog, became the only group of people that wasn’t shocked by its success.\n“This doesn’t really surprise us that much,” said junior guard Clayton Custer.\nHere’s why that isn’t ridiculous: Loyola-Chicago has been winning like this for the entire season. Its record is 32-5. Only two teams have lost fewer games all year. It’s 5-0 this season against major conference teams.\nAnd Loyola-Chicago didn’t just win Saturday night. It beat Kansas State so handily that for the second half, Philips Arena became a giddy rumpus room of fans chanting “L-U-C” in anticipation of the celebration to come.\nAt halftime, the Ramblers led 36-24. Then they opened up an 18-9 run to start the second half, raining a barrage of threes that put the game out of reach. This was no fluke. Loyola-Chicago got to this point rather simply. It was the better team.\nWhen the game was over, everyone basked in the moment that nobody believed was coming except for them. The confetti came down once, and that wasn’t enough. The players picked it up and threw it at each other. Sister Jean wasn’t going to miss out, either. She was wearing a Final Four cap amid the festivities. And she was wearing it backwards. She figured that’s how to celebrate.\n“I just did it because I knew that’s the way they do it,” she says, “so I decided to turn it around.”\nIn the one region that already had witnessed unprecedented madness, a No. 11 seed making it out, capped off by a backwards-hat-wearing nun, was the only outcome that made sense. This was the same part of the bracket where the University of Maryland, Baltimore County became the first No. 16 seed to upset a No. 1 when it beat Virginia.\nFrom a far enough distance, this Elite Eight game was a duel of Cinderellas fighting over a single glass slipper. Kansas State a No. 9. Loyola-Chicago a No. 11. Neither belonged here. Both hadn’t made serious noise in over half a century: Kansas State last reached the Final Four in 1964. The year before that, Loyola-Chicago won it all.\nBut these two teams were nothing alike. The Wildcats came from the mighty Big 12, annually one of college basketball’s best conferences—if not the best. They have made seven of the last nine NCAA tournaments.\nSister Jean Dolores Schmidt prays for the Loyola-Chicago Ramblers before action against Kansas State. Photo: John J. Kim/Zuma Press Meanwhile, Loyola-Chicago plays in the Missouri Valley Conference and was in the Horizon League before that. It hadn’t made the tournament in more than two decades. Until this season, it had gone 10 years without even going .500 in its mid-major conference.\nAmid this run, this is how beloved Loyola-Chicago has become: At a pregame event Saturday, Kentucky fans—yes, the same ones who came here expecting to see their team advance out of this region to the Final Four, only to find heartbreak against Kansas State in the Sweet 16—showed up wearing Ramblers gear and waited in line for a picture for a picture with Sister Jean.\nBut as remarkable as the fact that this team has gone this far is how it reached this point. Its first three wins came by a grand total of four points. It lit everyone’s brackets on fire with a series of nail-biters, and each one adding to a legend.\nFirst, it beat No. 6 seed Miami by two points with a three-pointer that came with one second left. In the second round, it beat No. 3 seed Tennessee on another late jumper. That one came with five seconds left. By the time the Ramblers beat Nevada here 69-68—secured by another late three—the insanity seemed somehow routine.\nThen came the romp that solidified not only Loyola-Chicago’s place in the record books, but also something even more shocking: Its status as a legitimate title contender.\nWrite to Andrew Beaton at andrew.beaton@wsj.com",
