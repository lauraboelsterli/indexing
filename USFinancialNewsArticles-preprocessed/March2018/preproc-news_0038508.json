    "text": "March 20, 2018 / 10:12 AM / Updated an hour ago Slovak president calls for stronger cabinet shuffle as protests continue Tatiana Jancarikova 4 Min Read BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Slovak President Andrej Kiska rejected prime minister-designate Peter Pellegrini’s proposed cabinet on Tuesday and called for stronger changes to the government by Friday to help calm a political crisis brought on by the murder of a journalist. President of Slovakia Andrej Kiska designates Peter Pellegrini for the new Slovak prime minister, at the Presidential Palace in Bratislava, Slovakia, March 15, 2018. REUTERS/David W. Cerny Slovakia has seen its largest mass protests since the peaceful overthrow of communism almost three decades ago after investigative reporter Jan Kuciak and his fiancee were shot dead in their home last month, swelling public anger of corruption. Protest organisers said they would hold a rally in the capital Bratislava and other cities for a fourth week on Friday. Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets to demand new elections and guarantees of a fair investigation into the death of Kuciak, 27, who had been investigating businessmen with political ties suspected of corruption. Prime Minister Robert Fico resigned last week to keep the three-party government afloat and proposed his Smer party colleague and deputy prime minister Pellegrini to take his place. But Pellegrini is under growing pressure to put forward a non-partisan official as interior minister, who would oversee police, to meet the demands of protesters and the president. “(Pellegrini) has to convince (people) that the new government will bring about changes that we are expecting,” Kiska said on his decision to reject the proposed cabinet and give Pellegrini until Friday to present a new proposal. “He has to create a stable government, whose composition, especially at the interior ministry, will be able to calm the tense atmosphere in our society.” Kiska, whose role as president is largely ceremonial, may still choose a different prime minister. But that nominee would have a hard time winning parliament’s approval and a row could eventually lead to a new election. Kiska has called for a government revamp or early elections to restore public trust in the Central European country of 5.4 million people, which has been an EU member since 2004. The president was due to meet protest organisers on Tuesday. They said on Tuesday on their Facebook page another protest would take place on Friday. More than 50,000 poured into Bratislava last week for a rally. “Tens of thousands of people are demonstrating... because they have lost confidence in an honest interest for justice from those heading the most important offices and ministries,” he said. The protests are a blow to Fico, who has been prime minister for 10 of the last 12 years during a time of fast economic growth and who has positioned Slovakia as a pro-European bastion in a eurosceptic region. Fico’s closest ally, Robert Kalinak, also resigned as interior minister in the crisis after holding office in all three Fico-led governments since 2006. Pellegrini had nominated Jozef Raz, a political independent serving as chief of staff at the Health Ministry, to replace him. Pellegrini’s spokesman said the prime minister-designate would react later on Tuesday to Kiska’s objections.
