    "text": "The Florida House passed a school safety bill Wednesday that includes new restrictions on rifle sales and a program to arm some teachers, sending the measure to the governor for his signature.\nThe vote of 67-50 reflected a mix of Republicans and Democrats in support and opposition. The measure, a response to the shootings at a Parkland high school that left 17 dead, is supported by the victims' families.\nAndrew Pollack, who lost his 18-year-old daughter Meadow in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, and Ryan Petty, who lost his 14-year-old daughter Alaina, said there was enough good in the bill that it should pass.\nDemocratic Rep. Kristin Jacobs said she did not like the idea of arming teachers, but she voted yes. Republican Rep. Jay Fant said raising the minimum age to buy a rifle from 18 to 21 was unconstitutional, and he voted no.\n\"There is a cultural divide in this room, in this state and across the country. And there's a bill before us that is not perfect,\" said Democratic Rep. Kristin Jacobs, whose district includes Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\nThe bill would raise the minimum age to buy rifles from 18 to 21 and create a waiting period on sales of the weapons. It would also create a so-called guardian program that would let school employees and many teachers carry handguns if they go through law enforcement training and if the school district decides to participate in the program.\nOther provisions would create new mental health programs for schools; establish an anonymous tip line where students and others could report threats to schools, ban bump stocks and improve communication between schools, law enforcement and state agencies.\nFant, who is running for attorney general, said the gun restrictions violate the constitution.\n\"I just can't imagine that Nikolas Cruz can commit such a heinous crime and then as a result we tell, potentially, a 20-year-old single mother living alone that she cannot purchase a firearm to defend herself,\" Fant said.\nThe Florida Senate narrowly passed the bill Monday. Gov. Rick Scott declined to say Wednesday whether he would sign the legislation.\nScott has repeatedly said he doesn't support arming teachers and pushed lawmakers adopt his proposal, which called for at least one law enforcement officer in every school and one for every thousand students who attend a school.\n\"I'm going to take the time and I'm going to read the bill and I'm going to talk to families,\" Scott told reporters.\nShooting suspect Cruz was formally charged with 17 counts of first-degree murder Wednesday, which could mean a death sentence if he is convicted.\nThe indictment returned by a grand jury in Fort Lauderdale also charges the 19-year-old with 17 counts of attempted murder for the Valentine's Day massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland in which 17 people died and more than a dozen others were wounded.\nCruz's public defender has said he will plead guilty if prosecutors take the death penalty off the table, which would mean a life prison sentence. Prosecutors have 45 days to decide whether they want to seek the death penalty.\nJames and Kimberly Snead, the couple who gave Cruz a home after his mother died late last year, testified before the grand jury. James Snead and the couple's attorney, Jim Lewis, wore silver \"17\" pins to honor the victims of the shooting.\nThe couple is \"trying to do the right thing\" and is mourning along with the rest of the Parkland community, Lewis said.\n\"We'll let justice take its course at this point,\" Lewis said. \"They still don't know what happened, why this happened. They don't have any answers. They feel very badly for everybody.\"\nCruz told investigators he took an AR-15 rifle to his former school on Feb. 14 and started shooting into classrooms.\nJail records released by the Broward Sheriff's Office show Cruz was being held in solitary confinement. Officers described Cruz as avoiding eye contact with deputies but also being cooperative and engaged with his visitors.\nThe report said Cruz \"often sits with a blank stare,\" asked for a Bible to read and appeared to be \"smiling and giggling\" during one visit with his attorneys. Investigators and psychiatrists also have visited Cruz in his single-person cell in the jail's infirmary, where officers note his activities every 15 minutes.\nHis brother visited him twice, along with Rocxanne Deschamps, who took in both teens after their mother died in November. Cruz lived with Deschamps only briefly before moving in with the Sneads.",
