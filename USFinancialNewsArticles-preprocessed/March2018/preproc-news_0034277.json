(TASE:BRIN), a leader in the advanced non-invasive treatment of brain disorders, today announced the Company’s financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, and provided a corporate update.\n“2017 was a record-setting year for us after the adoption of our new business model in the first quarter of 2017,” said Yaacov Michlin, Chief Executive Officer of Brainsway. “We adopted a business model focusing on leasing our Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (Deep TMS) systems to customers, which continues to resonate well in the marketplace. Accordingly, our fourth quarter 2017 revenues of $3.6 million were up 68% over the first quarter of 2017. We have enjoyed steady growth in both leases and in sales of our systems throughout 2017.”\n“Importantly, this growth has been achieved based mainly on systems leased or sold in the US for Major Depressive Disorder. In 2018, we look forward to receiving the FDA’s response to the De Novo application we filed for permission to market our Deep TMS system for the treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD),” added Mr. Michlin. “We also plan to expand our business geographically to the large European and Chinese markets in the near-term. Moreover, we are excited to advance our clinical studies, including our smoking cessation trial and potential trials in various neurological disorders.“\nCorporate Highlights\nDeveloping a clinical trial protocol for the Deep TMS device which will be assessed for safety and efficacy in the treatment of subjects with Opioid Use Disorder Expanding commercial efforts in Europe and China\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nNew leasing business model continues to generate significant revenue growth, quarter-over-quarter Total revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.6 million, up 68% from the $2.1 million of total revenues in the first quarter of 2017 Leasing revenues of $1.9 million in the fourth quarter Sales revenues of $1.7 million in the fourth quarter\nFull-Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $11.1 million, down 3% from the $11.5 million in total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2016, principally due to a change in the Company’s focus to the leasing model and a one-time revenue event in 2016 Leasing revenues of $6.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, representing 60% of total revenues Sales revenues of $4.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, representing 40% of total revenues Newly signed contracts increased the Company’s backlog for year-end 2017 to a record $27 million in total committed projected revenues from current leasing customers, not including additional potential usage fees.\nBalance Sheet\nAt December 31, 2017, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, and short-term deposits of $16.5 million. Brainsway completed an $8.5 million equity financing from leading Israeli investors as part of a private stock placement in December 2017 and secured a credit facility with Mizrahi Bank of $6 million. Brainsway’s cash burn rate is approximately $1 million per quarter.\nAbout Brainsway\nBrainsway is engaged in the research, development and marketing of a medical system for non-invasive treatment of common brain disorders. The medical system developed and manufactured by the company is based on a unique and breakthrough technology called Deep TMS, which can reach the depth of the brain and produce nerve stimulation or suppression. In the US, the Company’s device is FDA cleared for the treatment of major depression (MDD), and about 90% of MDD patients are eligible for coverage (including from both private and governmental payors). The Company's systems have also received CE clearance and are sold worldwide.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements about the Company’s expectations, beliefs and intentions.
