    "text": "March 30, 2018 / 2:59 AM / Updated an hour ago Fire kills 20 Myanmar migrant workers on bus in Thailand - police Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBANGKOK (Reuters) - A fire on board a bus in western Thailand killed 20 migrant workers from Myanmar early on Friday, police said. \nThe bus was carrying 47 workers who had just crossed the border into Thailand to work legally. Three other people on the bus were injured but the rest escaped unharmed, police said. \n“The driver said he saw fire breaking out from the middle of the bus, which then spread quickly,” Kritkanok Dan-udom, the chief of Maetor district police station, told Reuters. \nPictures in Thai media showed the burnt-out shell of the bus. \nThailand’s roads have been ranked as the deadliest in the world after Libya’s, according to the World Health Organization’s most recent study. \nThailand is estimated to have more than 3 million migrant workers, many of whom come from much poorer neighbour Myanmar. Work permit rules were tightened last year. Reporting by Panarat Thepgumpanat; Writing by Patpicha Tanakasempipat; Editing by Paul Tait",
