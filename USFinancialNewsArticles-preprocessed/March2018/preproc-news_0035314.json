    "text": "WALNUT CREEK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Central Garden & Pet Company (NASDAQ: CENT) (NASDAQ: CENTA), a leading innovator, producer and distributor of branded and private label products for the lawn & garden and pet supplies markets, today announced that Brooks Pennington III (Sonny) has succeeded Bill Brown as Chairman of the Board. Brown will remain on the Board of Directors and continue to focus on higher-level strategic initiatives for the Company.\nPennington has been on Central Garden & Pet’s Board of Directors for 20 years and has been the Company’s Director of Special Projects since 2006. Prior to his current role, Pennington served as the President and CEO of Pennington Seed from 1994 to 2006 and has almost 40 years’ experience in the lawn and garden industry. Pennington Seed was acquired by Central Garden & Pet in 1998.\nBill Brown, founder of Central Garden and Pet, commented, “Sonny has been an important part of Central’s success and has been an invaluable partner in helping grow our Company. He knows our culture and business well and I am confident he will be a wonderful steward for the business, working with management to move Central forward in the future.” Brown continued, “As for me, I will continue on the Board of Directors and chair the Board’s Investment Committee - working on strategic initiatives to help grow Central in the years ahead.”\nPennington added, “Bill has been an inspiration to us all. Since he took Central public in 1993, the Company has grown revenues by a compounded annual average of 8% and net income by 13%.” Pennington continued, “We are fortunate to have a strong management team led by CEO George Roeth, a highly-engaged Board, and a dedicated and talented employee base. I look forward to collaborating with all of them as we move forward to continue to grow our Company organically and through acquisitions into the future.”\nAbout Central Garden & Pet\nCentral Garden & Pet Company is a leading innovator, producer and distributor of branded and private label products for the lawn & garden and pet supplies markets.
