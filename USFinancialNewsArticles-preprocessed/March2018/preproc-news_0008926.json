    "text": "NEW YORK, March 5, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The American Kennel Club (AKC Â® ), the world's largest purebred dog registry and leading advocate for dogs, announces the hiring of Alan Fausel as Director of AKC Cultural Resources.\nMr. Fausel has an extensive background in the art industry, having worked at the Fine Arts Museums in San Francisco and the Frick Art Museum in Pittsburgh. He has also served as the Director of Fine Arts and Museum Services for Bonhams. He holds an M.A. in Art History from Stanford University and is a regular contributor to the Antiques Roadshow on PBS.\nIn his new role, he will be responsible for working on all aspects of the AKC Museum of the Dog relocation to NYC, including: leading the transport of the collection to New York, hiring of museum personnel, curation of exhibits and all operational functions. He will work closely with the Museum's current Director.\n\"It is a pleasure and an honor to join the AKC,\" says Fausel. \"The Museum has a uniquely beautiful collection of art. I am excited to help bring these pieces to the thriving art culture of New York and share them with new audiences from around the world.\"\nThe AKC Museum of the Dog, founded in 1982, was originally housed in The New York Life Building located at 51 Madison Avenue as part of the AKC Headquarters. In 1987, the Museum was moved to a temporary space in West St. Louis County, MO. The AKC was instrumental in founding the Museum and believes in its mission to protect and to share the amazing works of art donated by participants in the dog sport over the last 35 years. The new Museum will be housed at the Kalikow Building at 101 Park Ave., along with the AKC's NY Headquarters.\n\"We are very happy to have Mr. Fausel as a part of the transition back to NYC,\" said Sandra Stemmler, President of the AKC Museum of the Dog Board of Directors. \"His background and trusted knowledge of art will be valuable in moving the mission of the Museum forward.\"\nFausel will be located in the NYC AKC Headquarters.\nAbout the American Kennel Club\nFounded in 1884, the American Kennel Club is a not-for-profit organization which maintains the largest registry of purebred dogs in the world and oversees the sport of purebred dogs in the United States.
