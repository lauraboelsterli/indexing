    "text": "For the first time in over 30 years, the house from 1999's cult favorite movie \"10 Things I Hate About You,\" located in Tacoma, Washington, hit the market for $1.6 million .\nIt didn't last long: The dwelling, listed by agent Jeff Jensen , was scooped up after less than a week. Although the buyer knew that the property was featured in the movie, it wasn't a deciding factor, Jensen tells CNBC Make It.\nBut the Victorian home, with its iconic wrap around porch and custom woodwork, still conjures up plenty of nostalgia for the rest of us. Here's a peek inside what it looks like now.\nJeff Jenson Outside, the iconic wrap around porch, on which star Julia Stiles famously sat in the movie, frames the home.\n\"The most recognizable and most memorable part of the house was the front porch and curb appeal of the home,\" Jensen says.\nJeff Jenson Inside are custom inlay hardwood floors and wood panels, as well as original details like 400-pound solid oak pocket doors, according to the listing.\nJeff Jenson The 5,760-square-foot space was built in 1907 and has been largely preserved over the years.\nJeff Jenson \"It is essentially in original condition with updates to the mechanical and other systems of the house,\" Jensen says. \"Kitchen was remodeled in 2006 but walls, rooms and original details are all intact.\"\nJeff Jenson The kitchen features ample countertop space and plenty of natural light.\nJeff Jenson There are five bedrooms and three-and-a-half bathrooms, each spacious enough to comfortably fit queen-sized beds.\nJeff Jenson The listing notes that the property was \"built for entertaining and living large.\"\nJeff Jenson A den with a built-in bar provides an ideal space to hang out with guests. Or perhaps kick back and catch a rerun of Stiles and Heath Ledger in \"10 Things I Hate About You.\"\nBuena Vista | Getty Images Heath Ledger and Julia Stiles at swing in a scene from the film '10 Things I Hate About You', 1999.
