DirectTrust is a non-profit health care industry alliance created to support secure, identity-verified electronic exchanges of personal health information (PHI) between provider organizations, and between provider and patients, for the purpose of improved coordination of care.\n\"The organization is also seeking a new CEO to lead through the next era following the departure of current President and CEO David C. Kibbe, MD, MBA, at year-end so this is a pivotal time for the organization. We are seeking thought leaders who can translate the breadth of DirectTrust’s value proposition among the organization’s many constituencies,” stated DirectTrust Board Chair Paul Uhrig, Chief Administrative, Legal & Privacy Officer for Surescripts.\nDirectTrust’s non-paid Directors support the work of DirectTrust with mission-based leadership and strategic governance.
