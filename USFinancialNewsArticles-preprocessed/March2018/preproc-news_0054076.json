    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Finish Line, Inc. (NASDAQ: FINL) today reported results for the 14-week and 53-week periods ended March 3, 2018, compared to the 13-week and 52-week periods ended February 25, 2017.\nFor the 14-weeks ended March 3, 2018 compared to the 13-weeks ended February 25, 2017*:\nConsolidated net sales were $561.3 million, an increase of 0.7% over the prior year period. Finish Line’s sales decreased 0.9%. Finish Line comparable sales decreased 7.9%.** Finish Line Macy’s sales increased 8.5%. On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.40. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which primarily excludes the impact from impairment charges and store closing costs and the company’s revaluation of its deferred tax liability as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, were $0.59.\nFor the 53-weeks ended March 3, 2018 compared to the 52-weeks ended February 25, 2017*:\nConsolidated net sales were $1.84 billion, a decrease of 0.3% from the prior year period. Finish Line’s sales decreased 1.9%. Finish Line comparable sales decreased 3.9%.** Finish Line Macy’s sales increased 7.5%. On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.36. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, which primarily excludes the impact from impairment charges and store closing costs and the company’s revaluation of its deferred tax liability as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, were $0.69\n* Excludes comparable sales.\n** Finish Line comparable sales were calculated by comparing the 14-week and 53-week periods ended March 3, 2018 to the 14-week and 53-week periods ended March 4, 2017.\n“While we anticipated that our business would be under pressure during the fourth quarter due to a difficult selling environment for athletic footwear, sales ended up being down more than we forecasted,” said Sam Sato, Chief Executive Officer of Finish Line. “Despite the top-line headwinds, we worked hard on tightly controlling costs and managing inventories to deliver adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter at the high-end of our most recent guidance range of $0.58 to $0.59.”\nBalance Sheet\nAs of March 3, 2018, consolidated merchandise inventories decreased 2.8% to $321.7 million compared to $331.1 million as of February 25, 2017.\nAs of March 3, 2018, the company had no interest-bearing debt and $93.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. The company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock during the fourth quarter.\nAgreement with JD\nOn March 26, 2018, Finish Line announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with JD Sports Fashion Plc (“JD”) under which JD will acquire Finish Line for $13.50 per share in an all cash transaction. The merger agreement is subject to Finish Line and JD shareholder approval of the merger, the receipt of all required regulatory approvals, and the satisfaction of other customary conditions to closing. The expected timeline to close on this agreement is no earlier than June 2018. In light of the pending merger, Finish Line will not be hosting a conference call to discuss fourth quarter results.\nDisclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Measures\nThis report refers to certain financial measures that are identified as non-GAAP. The company believes that these non-GAAP measures, including selling, general, and administrative expenses, operating income, income tax (benefit) expense, net income from continuing operations, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations, are helpful to investors because they allow for a more direct comparison of the company’s year-over-year performance and are useful in assessing the company’s progress in achieving its long-term financial objectives. This supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures can be found at the end of this press release.\nAbout The Finish Line, Inc.\nThe Finish Line, Inc. is a premium retailer that carries the latest and greatest shoes, apparel and accessories.
