    "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., March 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TimefireVR, Inc. (OTCQB:TFVR) (the \"Company\"), d/b/a TeraForge, today announced the signing of a letter of intent (‘LOI’) to make a strategic investment and acquire a license in cryptocurrency data analytics, portfolio management, trading platform, and information sharing terminal, Cryptogram, LLC. The Company has also entered into a material definitive financing agreement in the principal amount of $1,052,632 with institutional investors. The gross proceeds of the transaction will be used for strategic investments and general working capital.\nCryptogram is a financial terminal focused on offering the cryptocurrency community access to data analytics, portfolio management, trading and facilitating the sharing of research and communication through a social network. Phase I of the Cryptogram terminal has been completed. The use of proceeds from this investment will be to expand Phase II and III, which will layer onto the platform social networking services as well as exchange and wallet capabilities. As part of the LOI, TeraForge will acquire a 10% equity interest in Cryptogram, LLC with a right of participation in subsequent issuances of equity as well as a warrant to purchase up to an additional 30% equity interest. Additionally, TeraForge will enter into a 10- year license agreement to market the product under the TeraForge branding in conjunction with other portfolio offerings.\n“After extensive due diligence and strategic evaluation of several investment opportunities, we are pleased to update our shareholders on the signing of our LOI with Cryptogram. This agreement falls in line with our shift in corporate focus towards strategic investments in both cryptocurrency and cryptyocurrency support-related acquisitions, and of blockchain technologies,” stated Jonathan Read, Chief Executive Officer of TeraForge. “The rapid interest in cryptocurrency has unveiled many opportunities that my team and I have methodically evaluated. After passing on many, we strongly believe in the vision of the Cryptogram team and the market need for an all-in-one terminal that the engineers at Cryptogram have built. We believe that the data driven from the system and the strength of their team will provide us a strong advantage in evaluating future investment opportunities in the space.”\nPrivate Placement Offering in Principal Amount of $1,052,632:\nOn March 6, 2018, the Company closed on a private placement offering with institutional investors pursuant to which the Company issued and sold Senior Secured Convertible Notes (the “Notes”) to the Investors in the aggregate principal amount of $1,052,632 with an original issue discount of 5%, and received gross proceeds of $1,000,000. The Notes mature on April 15, 2019 (the “Maturity Date”) and bear interest at 8% per annum. The notes are secured by a lien on all of the assets of the Company.\nIn addition, at the same time the Investors agreed to extend the due date of other Convertible Notes to April 15, 2019. The extended Convertible Notes consisted of $70,000 of Convertible Notes sold in October 2017, and $703,947 of Convertible Notes sold in December 2017, all of which were past due.\nFor more information regarding this Material Definitive Agreement please refer to the Company’s FORM 8-K .\nMr. Jonathan Read commented, “With the additional working capital, we will continue to explore further investment in the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, similar to the investments we have already made in etherum and now upon closing in Cryptogram. I want to thank our investors for believing in our vision and business strategy within this bourgeoning industry.”\nName Change to TeraForge Ventures Inc.:\nThe Company is in the process of changing its name to TeraForge Ventures Inc. and in the interim is doing business as (d/b/a) TeraForge. The Company has filed a preliminary Proxy Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to a shareholders meeting.\nAbout TimefireVR Inc., d/b/a TeraForge\nTimefireVR Inc., d/b/a TeraForge, is an Arizona based technology company focused on strategic investments in blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies.
