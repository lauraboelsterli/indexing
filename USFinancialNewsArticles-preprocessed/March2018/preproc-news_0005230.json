However, Dallas rookie guard Dennis Smith Jr. missed a shot on the Mavericks’ final possession of overtime, and the Thunder survived.\nDallas forward Dwight Powell scored 21 points, including the tying basket off an offensive rebound with 0.3 seconds left in regulation that sent the game to overtime tied at 100.\nHarrison Barnes led the Mavericks with 26 points.\nMavs veteran Dirk Nowitzki scored 12 points and became the sixth player in NBA history to reach 31,000 career points. He reached the milestone with one of his trademark step-back jumpers in the second quarter.\nNowitzki knocked down a 3-pointer midway through the fourth quarter, capping a 7-0 Dallas run and giving the Mavericks a 91-84 lead.\nThe Thunder answered with 3-pointers from Raymond Felton and Carmelo Anthony and were down only one with 5:49 left to play.\nOklahoma City used a 15-0 run early in the first quarter to build its lead. Anthony hit a 3-pointer and Westbrook hit a jumper to cap the run and give the Thunder a 19-9 lead. They led 32-21 after the first quarter and maintained their 11-point lead heading into halftime.\nDallas opened the second half with a run and tied the score at 64 on a 3-pointer by Barnes midway through the third quarter.\nGeorge hit a jumper to give the Thunder a 77-76 lead heading into the fourth quarter.\nThe Thunder now head west to complete their road trip with back-to-back games at Phoenix and Portland, starting Friday against the Suns.\nDallas is at Chicago on Friday.\n--Field Level Media\n ",
