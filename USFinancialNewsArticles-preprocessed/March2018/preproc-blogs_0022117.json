    "text": "U.S. stocks have done extremely well since the end of the financial crisis, but real estate investment trust GGP has left everyone in the dust.\nGGP , which invests in shopping centers and changed its name in 2017 from General Growth Properties, is up more than 7,000 percent since the S&P 500 reached its financial crisis closing bottom on March 9, 2009. That makes it the best performer in the benchmark since the bull market began.\nGGP closed at 29 cents a share that day. On Thursday, it closed at $21.11.\nUnited Rentals and streaming giant Netflix are the second and third best-performing S&P 500 components since the start of the bull market, surging more than 5,500 percent each.\nFriday marks the ninth anniversary of the \"Haines Bottom.\" On CNBC on March 10, 2009, anchor Mark Haines called the previous day's close the bottom of the crisis.\nOn March 9, 2009, the S&P 500 closed at 676.53. Since then, the S&P 500 is up around 300 percent, with consumer discretionary as the best-performing sector.\nDiscretionary is up more than 550 percent since \"The Haines Bottom,\" with Amazon among the best-performing stocks in the sector. The e-commerce giant is up more than 2,000 percent in that time period.",
