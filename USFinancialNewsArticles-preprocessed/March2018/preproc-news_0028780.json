    "text": "NEW YORK, Alcentra Capital Corporation (NASDAQ: ABDC) (\"Alcentra\" or the \"Company\"), a provider of customized debt and equity financing solutions primarily to lower middle-market and middle-market companies based in the United States, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Summary\nTotal investment income of $8.2 million Net investment income of $4.0 million, or $0.28 per share based on weighted average shares of common stock outstanding Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of ($13.4) million Invested $36.8 million in debt securities; one new investment, one refinancing and one add on investment Received proceeds from repayments of $15.7 million Paid quarterly dividend for the Q4 2017 of $0.25 per share on January 4, 2018 On November 16, 2017, the Board of Directors expanded the open market stock repurchase program by $2.5 million to $5.0 million. Net asset value of $157.7 million, or $11.09 per share, which is down from $12.27 in the third quarter of 2017 Weighted Average Debt Portfolio Yield â€“ 11.3%\nFull Year 2017 Financial Summary\nTotal investment income of $33.4 million Net Investment income of $18.3 million, or $1.32 per share Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of ($19.1) million Invested $135.5 million in debt and equity securities, including investments in 4 new portfolio companies Received proceeds from repayments of $90.1 million Paid dividends totaling $1.30 per share (inclusive of $0.03 special dividend)\nFirst Quarter 2018 Dividend\nOn March 8, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share for the first quarter of 2018, which is payable on April 4, 2018 to stockholders of record as of March 30, 2018.\nManagement Commentary\nOn March 8, 2018, the Board of Directors reduced the first quarter 2018 quarterly dividend to $0.18 per share. David Scopelliti, the Company's CEO, stated, \"The board's view on the dividend policy is to make distributions to shareholders in line with the earnings potential of the portfolio. The market environment and yield profile has changed since the initial dividend rate of $0.34 per share was established following our IPO in May 2014. Contributing to the dividend reduction this quarter was (i) lower earnings associated with the portfolio of high yielding unsecured subordinated debt (ii) further credit markdowns in Q4 2017, (iii) ongoing repayments of high coupon performing loans, (iv) rotation to senior secured loans, which have lower pricing than the subordinated debt portfolio and (v) overall private credit market yield compression. Given that we believe we are in the late stages of the credit cycle, we are pursuing a portfolio construction with more senior secured debt to reduce risk of principal loss or impairment. This strategy will allow us to generate income without reducing the quality of new investments by reaching for yield. Mr. Scopelliti further stated, \"We continue to be committed to creating shareholder value through share repurchases and aligning the dividend with the current earnings power of the portfolio.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, total investment income was $8.2 million, a decrease of $2.7 million over the $10.9 million of total investment income for the three months ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily attributable to the conversion of Conisus debt to equity, the addition of Southern Technical Institute to non-accrual status, the further write down of Media Storm along with a shift in timing of the closing of new deals. Interest and PIK income comprised $6.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively and other income was $0.7 million. Net investment income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $4.0 million ($0.28 per share based on average shares outstanding of 14.2 million).\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, net expenses were $4.2 million, a decrease of $0.6 million from the $4.8 million of net expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2016. This decrease is due largely to the decrease in earned incentive fees. Interest and financing expenses for the quarter was $2.1 million and the base management fee was $1.3 million. Professional fees and other general and administrative expenses totaled $0.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the quarter, we also recorded a net change in unrealized depreciation from portfolio investments of $15.6 million attributable largely to unrealized depreciation of our debt investments in Southern Technical Institute, Media Storm and Conisus. The net decrease in net assets resulting from operations post benefit for taxes during the three months ended December 31, 2017 was ($13.4) million.\nPortfolio and Investment Activities\nAs of December 31, 2017, the fair value of our investment portfolio totaled $287.6 million and consisted of 29 portfolio companies. The average portfolio investment at amortized cost was $11.5 million and equity constituted 10.1% of the fair value of the portfolio. During the fourth quarter, we invested $36.8 million in debt and equity investments, including one new investment and two add-on investments and received proceeds from repayments on investments of $15.7 million. As of December 31, 2017, the weighted average yield on debt investments was 11.3%.\nNew and add-on investments during the quarter included the following:\nCirrus Medical Staffing - $19.3 million in L+8.25% 1 st lien secured debt Healthcare Associates of Texas - Refinanced our 2nd lien debt at 12.25% with 1st lien secured debt at L+8.0%; $15.0 million of additional capital invested Medsurant - Additional $2.5 million of 2 nd lien secured debt at 13.0%\nAs of December 31, 2017, Alcentra had three debt investments on non-accrual - Show Media, Southern Technical Institute, Media Storm.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt December 31, 2017, Alcentra had $13.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, $89.7 million of borrowings outstanding on its $135 million senior secured revolving credit facility and $55.0 million outstanding of Alcentra Capital InterNotes.\nSubsequent Events\nOn January 3, 2018, Stancor, Inc.
