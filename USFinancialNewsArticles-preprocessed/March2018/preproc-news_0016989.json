    "text": "By Alex Scimecca 2:37 PM EST \nThe Coca-Cola Company announced it’ll be adding a new alcoholic beverage to its portfolio exclusively in the Japanese market. The low-alcohol drink, or Chu-Hi, will be a watered-down mixture of the shōchū spirit plus flavoring . This isn’t the first time Coca-Cola has experimented with flavors and tastes, especially in Japan. \nNot all flavors are successful, but the unique flavors deserve a round of applause. Below are five other unusual Coca-Cola products that were released. \nBeverly \nIntroduced in 1969, Beverly was an Italian apertif. Designed to be consumed before meals and believed to aid digestion, competitors like Campari and San Pellegrino led to its discontinuation in 2009. \nNew Coke Coca Cola billboard for the short-lived New Coke.

In blind taste tests, people generally preferred the new recipe compared to the old . But three months after making the switch, the company announced the return of the classic Coca-Cola.

OK Soda cans had grim-looking illustrations in its ad campaign that responded to the idea that Generation X was cynical and disillusioned. It’s slogan was “Things are going to be ok” and it even had its own manifesto. It was discontinued in 1995 . Coca-Cola Blak: \nCoffee in soda? Coca-Cola developed this recipe for two years and finally released the carbonated coffee drink in 2006. It hoped it would tap into the premium coffee markets, but just one year later Blak was discontinued. Coca-Cola Plus This, photo shows bottles of Coca-Cola Ginger, left, and Coca-Cola Plus. \nAfter more than a decade of research and development, Coca-Cola launched its first ever soda approved by the FOSHU Japanese food standard. The no-calorie and no-sugar drink contains fiber that will help suppress fat absorption and help moderate blood sugar levels. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
