(Nasdaq:ABCD) (the “Company”), an award-winning educational technology solutions leader dedicated to helping all students reach their potential through individualized and differentiated instruction, announced today financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n“Cambium Learning Group delivered solid fourth quarter and 2017 growth, in line with our most recent expectations,” said John Campbell, Chief Executive Officer of Cambium Learning Group. “Our digital solutions at Learning A-Z and ExploreLearning, as well as LANGUAGE! Live at Voyager Sopris Learning, grew at double-digit rates and together drove our technology-enabled solutions to 79% of total Bookings mix in 2017. This growth enabled us to deliver on the promise of our increasingly technology-enabled, software as a service (SaaS) business model, driving margin expansion and higher Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Income. This in turn increased cash generated from our operations by 11%, self-funding our investments in future growth and enabling us to prepay a portion of our debt. We begin 2018 having made necessary adjustments to our sales and marketing tactics, which prepare us to capture additional top-line growth this year.”\nFinancial Snapshot\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported the following financial results:\nThree Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2017 2016 $ Change 2017 2016 $ Change GAAP net revenues $ 38.3 $ 37.5 $ 0.8 $ 158.2 $ 152.4 $ 5.8 GAAP net income* 30.3 2.9 27.3 45.1 10.4 34.6 Net income margin %* 79 % 8 % 28 % 7 % EBITDA 6.7 10.7 (3.9 ) 41.4 39.5 1.9 Adjusted EBITDA 12.9 11.9 1.0 49.0 42.8 6.2 Adjusted EBITDA margin % 34 % 32 % 31 % 28 % Bookings $ 37.0 $ 34.6 $ 2.3 $ 164.4 $ 161.8 $ 2.6 Cash income 7.5 6.3 1.2 36.1 31.8 4.3 Cash income margin % 20 % 18 % 22 % 20 % * 2017 fourth quarter and full-year periods include a tax benefit of $30.2 million and $29.3 million, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Financial Highlights\nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 4% to $158.2 million compared with $152.4 million in 2016. GAAP net revenues by segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to prior year were as follows:\n• Learning A-Z ® – $75.1 million, increased $9.1 million or 14%\n• ExploreLearning ® – $27.9 million, increased $4.1 million or 17%\n• Voyager Sopris Learning ® – $55.2 million, decreased $(7.4) million or (12)%.\nBookings for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 2% to $164.4 million compared with $161.8 million in 2016, with growth of $7.5 million at Learning A-Z and $4.9 million at ExploreLearning, partially offset by a Voyager Sopris Learning Bookings decline of $9.8 million.\nTechnology-enabled Bookings represented 79% of total 2017 Bookings compared with 73% of 2016 Bookings, and grew 10% compared to 2016.\nNet interest expense was $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, down $2.3 million from 2016 as a result of the scheduled debt amortization payments and voluntary prepayments.\nThe Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $4.3 million related to the Kurzweil Education brand solutions, which experienced a Bookings decline of 9% in 2017 and is now fully integrated within the Voyager Sopris Learning segment structure.\nThe Company recorded an income tax benefit of $30.2 million and $29.3 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, predominantly the result of a reduction of the valuation allowance against most of the Company's deferred tax assets offset by a remeasurement of deferred tax assets at the newly-enacted corporate tax rate.\nNet income was $45.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, up $34.6 million when compared to a net income of $10.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $49.0 million, up $6.2 million from 2016. Excluding the effect of the tax benefit on net income, the increase in GAAP net revenues, along with a greater portion of the top-line mix coming from the higher margin Learning A-Z and ExploreLearning segments, drove improvement in both net income and Adjusted EBITDA.\nIn response to lower-than-expected performance at the Voyager Sopris Learning segment in 2017, management completed restructuring activities to reduce its cost structure, and incurred $1.1 million of severance costs in the fourth quarter, in addition to the $0.3 million of severance costs incurred in the third quarter. These restructuring costs are excluded from the Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Income non-GAAP measures.\nCash Income was $36.1 million, an increase of $4.3 million compared to $31.8 million reported in the year ended December 31, 2016. Capital expenditures reflect planned investments in product development and totaled $18.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 versus $20.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016.\nIn October 2017, the Company voluntarily prepaid the remaining $9.6 million principal amount outstanding on the Term Loan B of the Senior Secured Credit Facility. In December 2017, the Company voluntarily prepaid $11.0 million of principal on the Term Loan A of the Senior Secured Credit Facility.\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents of $8.5 million at December 31, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operations was $49.2 million, cash used in investing activities was $19.2 million, and cash used in financing activities was $26.4 million. At December 31, 2017, the principal amount of the term loan outstanding was $48.5 million, and there were no borrowings outstanding under the Company's revolving credit facility.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nGAAP net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 2% to $38.3 million compared with $37.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. GAAP net revenues by segment for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and the change from the same period of 2016, were as follows:\n• Learning A-Z – $19.8 million, increased $1.9 million or 10%\n• ExploreLearning – $7.2 million, increased $1.0 million or 15%\n• Voyager Sopris Learning – $11.3 million, decreased $(2.0) million or (15)%\nBookings for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 7% to $37.0 million compared with $34.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nThe Company reported net income of $30.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a net income of $2.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of $27.3 million. GAAP net income includes an income tax benefit of $30.2 million and a goodwill impairment charge of $4.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $12.9 million, increasing $1.0 million from $11.9 million in 2016. Excluding the effect of the tax benefit and goodwill impairment on net income, the increase in GAAP net revenues, along with a greater portion of the top-line mix coming from the higher margin Learning A-Z and ExploreLearning segments, drove improvement in both net income and Adjusted EBITDA.\nNet interest expense was $1.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, down $0.6 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of the scheduled debt amortization payments and voluntary prepayments made during 2016.\nCash Income was $7.5 million, an increase of $1.2 million compared to Cash Income of $6.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Capital expenditures totaled $4.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus $3.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFiscal Year 2017 Segment Discussion\nNet Revenues, Bookings, Net Income, and Cash Income changes by segment for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period of 2016 were:\nQ4 - 2017\n% Change YTD - 2017\n% Change Net Revenues Bookings Net Income Cash Income Net Revenues Bookings Net Income Cash Income Learning A-Z 10 % 14 % 14 % 12 % 14 % 10 % 15 % 8 % ExploreLearning 15 % 21 % 4 % 12 % 17 % 19 % 24 % 28 % Voyager Sopris Learning (15 )% (19 )% (42 )% 3 % (12 )% (16 )% (13 )% (23 )% Shared Services 229 % (7 )% 66 % 5 % Cambium Learning Group, Inc. 2 % 7 % 929 % 19 % 4 % 2 % 332 % 13 % Bookings increased 2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. By segment:\nLearning A-Z reported Bookings growth of $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, representing a double-digit year over year growth rate of 10%.\nExploreLearning reported a $4.9 million, or 19%, Bookings increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 with double-digit growth for both the Reflex ® math product and the Gizmos ® math and science simulations.\nVoyager Sopris Learning reported a Bookings decline of $(9.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The Bookings decline of (16)% came primarily from the segment’s legacy print and transactional solutions, which are not the strategic focus of the segment, and were 21% lower than prior year. Bookings for the segment’s technology-enabled solutions declined 3%, falling short of Company expectations for growth this year, as slow traction for the new Velocity ® solution combined with an expected decline in many of the older technology offerings. LANGUAGE! Live ® , the segment’s digital flagship solution for technology-enabled adolescent intervention, had strong growth of 20% during the year.\n2018 Outlook\nMr. Campbell concluded, “Our 2017 results show our continued focus on increasing cash generation and the long term value of the company. For 2018, we expect improved top-line growth, coupled with disciplined expense management, while investing in development, marketing and sales, should drive continued expansion in our Cash Income, Adjusted EBITDA, and cash flow generation. Cambium Learning’s mission is to leverage technology to create solutions that are personalized, adaptive, scalable, and designed to achieve results in the classroom that can change the trajectory of students’ lives. Demand for these solutions is strong, and we are poised and ready to execute well and to deliver strong financial results in 2018.”\nCompany-wide, management is setting an initial outlook for 2018 Bookings growth at a higher percentage than 2017, with most of the growth expected in the second half of the year during the Company’s seasonally strong periods. Cambium Learning Group’s business is highly seasonal, with Bookings historically peaking during the third quarter, which represents by far the preponderance of Bookings, revenue, and income each year, and management expects to refine its Bookings outlook as the year progresses.\nThe Company expects its 2018 Bookings growth to be driven by its two 100% technology subscription businesses Learning A-Z and ExploreLearning. Voyager Sopris Learning is expected to build on the momentum of the LANGUAGE! Live solution and continue to make progress on repositioning the segment's role in the intervention marketplace.\nThe Company expects 2018 capital expenditures to be roughly consistent with 2017 and expects growth in its Cash Income margin from 2017, with the impact of spending on strategic investments in its technology subscription products offset by the ongoing benefit of the transition in mix to these higher margin product lines. Absent another use of cash during the year, the Company expects to be substantially debt free by the end of 2018.\nConference Call\nCambium Learning Group's management team will conduct a conference call at 9 a.m. EST today (Wednesday, March 7, 2018) to discuss its financial results. Participants are encouraged to listen to the presentation via a live web broadcast at www.cambiumlearning.com in the Investor Relations section. In addition, a live dial-in is available at 844.707.0670 or 703.639.1224, passcode # 8577809.\nA replay will be available by dialing 855.859.2056 or 404.537.3406, passcode # 8577809, until March 8, 2018. The webcast will also be archived on the Company's Investor Relations page.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Cash Income are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly named, non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they reflect the underlying performance of the ongoing operations of the Company and provide investors with a view of the Company’s operations from management’s perspective. Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Income remove significant restructuring, non-operational, or certain non-cash items from earnings. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Income to monitor and evaluate the operating performance of the Company and as the basis to set and measure progress toward performance targets. Further, the Cash Income measure directly affects compensation for employees and executives. The Company generally uses these non-GAAP measures as measures of operating performance and not as measures of the Company’s liquidity. The Company’s presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Cash Income should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual, non-operational, or non-cash items.\nAbout Cambium Learning Group, Inc.\nCambium Learning ® Group (Nasdaq:ABCD) is an award-winning educational technology solutions leader dedicated to helping all students reach their potential through individualized and differentiated instruction.
