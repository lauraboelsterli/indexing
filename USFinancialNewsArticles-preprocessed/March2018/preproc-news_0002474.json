    "text": "2 Mins Ago | 03:24 \nFive years after his on-air verbal brawl with Pershing Square's Bill Ackman over Herbalife , Carl Icahn said he made a billion dollars from his investment in the nutritional supplement maker. \n\"I enjoy a good fight, especially when I win it,\" Icahn said on CNBC's \" Halftime Report \" Thursday. \"On paper, I made a billion.\" \nIcahn said his relationship with Ackman is friendly. \n\"I honestly, in a strange way, I thank Bill ... I wish him well,\" he said. \"He called me up yesterday and congratulated me.\" \nThe billionaire investor added he has not sold a single share of Herbalife stock. \n\"Herbalife management did an incredible job through this. It was a major distraction for Herbalife,\" he said. \"I think Herbalife is a great company, makes great products.\" \nAckman told CNBC Wednesday he exited his losing bet against Herbalife , five years after his argument with Carl Icahn on CNBC. \nThe Icahn-Ackman fight occurred on Jan. 25, 2013, while Ackman was being interviewed by telephone. Ackman was responding to attacks by Icahn the previous day over Ackman's claims that Herbalife was \"a well-managed pyramid scheme.\" \nIcahn called in to the show, saying \"Ackman is a liar\" and that he had \"one of the worst reputations on Wall Street.\" \n\"I've really about had it with this guy,\" Icahn said. \"He's like the crybaby in the school yard.\" \nâ€” CNBC's Liz Moyer contributed to this report.
