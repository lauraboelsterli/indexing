    "text": "0 COMMENTS As Spotify knows well, hitting the right notes doesn’t always produce a hit.\nThe music streaming giant sounded good at its f irst official meeting with prospective investors on Thursday. This meeting was in lieu of a traditional IPO roadshow, since Spotify isn’t doing a traditional IPO. Instead the company plans to list its shares directly on the New York Stock Exchange on April 3, effectively allowing the market to set the price. Spotify said Thursday it will issue a forecast for the current year the week before the listing.\nThe company did share some helpful clues. Most notable was its long-term goal of reaching gross margins of 30% to 35%. Spotify grew this number by 7 percentage points last year to 21%, mainly by striking new deals with music labels.\nThat would suggest that much of Spotify’s future hinges on the negotiating power of its lawyers . But the company on Thursday also outlined several ways it is building up alternative revenue drivers into its model. This includes advertising as well as services to help artists and music labels better target their offerings. On a service with more than 35 million songs, Spotify’s ability to guide users through the jungle could prove lucrative.\nThe trick for investors will be deciding how much to pay for that opportunity now. It is hard to tell based on private sales of company shares and industry valuations. In private sales so far this year, Spotify’s shares have fetched anywhere from $48.93 to $132.50. That would value the company at between 1.8 times trailing sales and 4.8 times based on the company’s most recent share count.\nPandora , the company’s closest publicly traded peer, trades about 0.9 times trailing sales while video-streaming stalwart Netflix trades at nearly 12 times. Spotify clearly prefers comparisons with the latter. But investors would be wiser to set a lower bar early on. The best songs sometimes take a while to catch on.",
