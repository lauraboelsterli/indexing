    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Atlas Cloud Enterprises Inc. (CSE:AKE) (XFRA:A49) (OTC:ATLEF) (the “Company” or “Atlas Cloud”) is pleased to announce the closing of the previously disclosed acquisition of MKH Electric City Holdings LLC, a Washington State company. The transaction includes a 6,600-sq. ft. facility (“The Grant County Data Centre”) which is currently being upgraded to industrial-scale cryptocurrency mining standards.\nThe facility, located in Electric City Washington, is less than five kilometers from the Grand Coulee Dam which impounds a sizable portion of the Columbia River. Due to its location, the facility significantly benefits from electrical provisioning at approximately $0.03/kWh, one of the least expensive commercial rates in the world. Atlas Cloud’s energy consumption dedicated to digital currency mining for this individual location is 3.0 megawatts (“MW”), supplied by the Grant County Public Utility Department with the ability to upgrade to 5.0 MW.\nThe Grant County Data Centre, utilizing 80% of the current 3.0 MW of dedicated power, can host up to 1,700 Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) mining servers. A second phase (an additional 2.0 MW) is expected to be completed in 2019, increasing total energy dedicated to digital currency mining to 5.0 MW. Atlas Cloud is fully funded to complete Phase 1 and 2 of the Grant County Data Centre.\nThe capital acquisition represents a $300,000 USD investment. Infrastructure costs and related expenses aimed at completing the data centre are budgeted up to $2,600,000 USD.\nAbout Atlas Cloud Enterprises Inc.
