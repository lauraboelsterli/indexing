    "text": "Apple Watch is slowly but surely cornering the wearables market â€” and the field of rivals is thinning as competitors flee the industry, according to new research from IDC.\nAbout 37.9 million wearables were shipped in the 2017 holiday season, up nearly 8 percent from the prior year, IDC analysts estimated in a report published Thursday . Apple shipped 8 million wearables, becoming the single biggest vendor for the first time with a 21 percent market share and 57.5 percent year-over-year growth.\nBut overall, the market isn't growing as fast as before: Between 2015 and 2016, wearables shipments grew 27.3 percent, IDC said, and last year, overall growth was 10.3 percent.\nshow chapters ",
