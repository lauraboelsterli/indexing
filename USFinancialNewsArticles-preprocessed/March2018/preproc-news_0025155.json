    "text": "WAYNE, Pa., March 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Egalet Corporation (Nasdaq: EGLT) (\"Egalet\"), a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative treatments for pain and other conditions, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, including updates on its commercial products: SPRIX ® (ketorolac tromethamine) Nasal Spray, OXAYDO ® (oxycodone HCI, USP) tablets for oral use only –CII and ARYMO ® ER (morphine sulfate) extended-release tablets for oral use —CII.\n\"The fourth quarter of 2017 demonstrated continued momentum for SPRIX, OXAYDO and ARYMO ER with combined prescriptions growing more than 35 percent over the third quarter 2017 and revenue of $7.8 million,\" said Bob Radie, president and chief executive officer of Egalet. \"We believe that with our strong cash position, expected revenue growth through our own efforts and those of our partners coupled with expense reductions, Egalet is well positioned for 2018.\"\n2017 Highlights\nOutperformed analyst consensus with 2017 net product sales of $26.1 million; Prescriptions for SPRIX Nasal Spray grew to over 33,000 in 2017 representing growth of more than 100 percent over 2016; Prescribers of SPRIX grew to almost 6,000 since launch, including nearly 800 new prescribers in the fourth quarter of 2017 representing 80 percent growth over the same period in 2016; Secured coverage of ARYMO ER by a large payer providing commercial coverage for over 24 million member lives and Medicare Part D coverage for over 1.4 million member lives; and Partner Ascend Therapeutics began promotion of SPRIX Nasal Spray to its target women's healthcare providers.\n2017 Fourth Quarter and Full-Year Financial Results\nCash Position: As of December 31, 2017, Egalet had cash and marketable securities totaling $91.0 million. Cash used in operating activities for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $10.0 million down from $15.8 million in the same period of 2016. Net Product Sales: There were net product sales of $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. There were net product sales of $7.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to $6.1 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in both periods was due to continued growth in SPRIX Nasal Spray and OXAYDO sales and the fact that ARYMO ER was launched at the end of the first quarter of 2017. Cost of Sales (excluding product rights amortization) : Cost of sales was $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Cost of sales was $1.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and $1.1 million for the same period in 2016. Cost of sales for the quarter and the year ended 2017 is related to the sales of Egalet's three commercially available products. Cost of sales for the quarter and the year ended 2016 related to the sales of SPRIX Nasal Spray and OXAYDO. G&A Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $34.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $30.7 million for year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to FDA-mandated post-marketing studies and increases in annual regulatory filing fees. General and administrative expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $6.3 million compared to $7.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in depreciation of assets retired in 2016. S&M Expenses: Sales and marketing expenses were $35.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the period was related to the launch of ARYMO ER in the beginning of 2017. Sales and marketing expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $8.1 million compared to $8.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. R&D Expenses: Research and development expenses were $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $33.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Research and development expenses for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 were $1.6 million compared to $6.9 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in both periods was driven primarily by decrease in our development program expenses related to ARYMO ER, Egalet-002 and OXAYDO clinical trials. Interest Expense: Interest expense was $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $12.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Interest expense for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $3.7 million compared to interest expense of $3.9 million for the same period in 2016. Interest expense for 2017 primarily consisted of interest expense related to the 5.50% convertible notes and the 13.0% senior secured notes and interest expense for 2016 primarily consisted of interest expense related to the Hercules Loan Agreement, the 5.50% convertible notes and the 13.0% senior secured notes. Of the interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017, $5.2 million was non-cash interest while there was $7.3 million of non-cash interest for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gain on Extinguishment of Debt: Gain on the extinguishment of debt of $13.2 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 was attributable to the note exchange for a portion of the Company's 5.50% convertible notes in December 2017. Net Income (Loss): Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $69.4 million, or $2.05 per share, compared to a net loss of $90.6 million, or $3.70 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $1.5 million, or $0.03 per share, compared to a net loss of $21.4 million, or $0.87 per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The net income for the fourth quarter 2017 was primarily driven by the $13.2 million gain on the extinguishment of the debt associated with the 5.50% convertible notes exchanged in December 2017.\nEarnings Conference Call Information\nEgalet's management will host a conference call to discuss the fourth quarter and year-end 2017 financial results today:\nDate:\nMonday, March 12, 2018\nTime:\n8:30 a.m. EDT\nWebcast (live and archive):\negalet.com (Events & Webcasts, Investor page)\nDial-in numbers:\n1-888-346-2615 (domestic)\n1-412-902-4253 (international)\nReplay numbers:\n1-877-344-7529 (domestic)\n1-412-317-0088 (international)\nConference number:\n10117571\nAbout Egalet\nEgalet, a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company, is focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative treatments for pain and other conditions. Egalet has three approved products: ARYMO ® ER (morphine sulfate) extended-release tablets for oral use —CII, developed using Egalet's proprietary Guardian™ Technology, OXAYDO ® (oxycodone HCI, USP) tablets for oral use only —CII and SPRIX ® (ketorolac tromethamine) Nasal Spray. Using Guardian Technology, Egalet has developed a pipeline of clinical-stage, product candidates for which we are seeking partners including Egalet-002, an abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral oxycodone formulation for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. Guardian Technology can be applied broadly across different classes of pharmaceutical products and can be used to develop combination products that include multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients with similar or different release profiles.\nFor full prescribing information on ARYMO ER, including the boxed warning and medication guide, please visit arymoer.com .
