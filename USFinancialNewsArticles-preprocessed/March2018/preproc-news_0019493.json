    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ChromaDex Corporation (NASDAQ:CDXC), a science-based, integrated nutraceutical company devoted to improving the way people age, announced today fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.\nResults of operations for the three months ended Dec. 30, 2017\nFor the three months ended Dec. 30, 2017 (“Q4 2017”), ChromaDex reported net sales from continuing operations of $7.5 million, up 69% compared to $4.5 million from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in fourth quarter revenues was driven by growth in sales of TRU NIAGEN®.\nGross profit improved in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 50.9% as compared to 45.1% for the same period in 2016. We experienced better margins due to the positive impact of TRU NIAGEN® consumer product sales, which we anticipate will continue.\nOperating expenses were $12.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $4.2 million from continuing operations in the same period for 2016. The increase in operating expenses for fourth quarter was the result of our strategic decision to invest in marketing to build out the TRU NIAGEN brand, as well as legal costs associated with ongoing litigation and higher stock-based compensation expense.\nThe net loss attributable to common stockholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $8.8 million or ($0.17) per share as compared to a net loss of $2.1 million or ($0.06) per share for Q4 2016. The higher losses in the fourth quarter were the result of the strategic decision to invest ahead of growth, higher legal fees associated with ongoing litigation and higher stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by higher sales volume and gross profits.\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, the reported loss from continuing operations was negatively impacted by a non-cash charge of $3.4 million related to stock-based compensation.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, was ($5.2) million for Q4 2017, compared to adjusted EBITDA of ($1.7) million for Q4 2016. ChromaDex defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) adjusted for income tax, interest, depreciation, amortization and non-cash stock compensation costs. The Basic and Diluted Adjusted EBITDA per share for Q4 2017 was ($0.10) versus ($0.05) for Q4 2016.\nWe also ended the fourth quarter of 2017 with a solid balance sheet with quarter-end cash of $45.4 million.\n“We continue to see validation from the research community, as evidence builds through peer-reviewed publications,” said Frank Jaksch, Jr., CEO and co-founder of ChromaDex. “Our undisputed leadership in NAD research will be the foundation of continued growth for TRU NIAGEN.”\nRob Fried, President and Chief Operating Officer commented: “It has been less than a year since we made the strategic decision to focus on TRU NIAGEN and NAD. We are very pleased with the increase in gross margin which reflects the growing value of the TRU NIAGEN brand. Our strategy is thus far playing out ahead of plan.”\nResults of operations for the year ended Dec. 30, 2017\nFor full year 2017, net revenues were $21.2 million from continuing operations, down 2% compared to $21.7 million from continuing operations for full year 2016 as the Company shifted to an integrated global consumer product nutraceutical company.\nGross profit improved in the full year 2017 to 49.4% as compared to 48.0% for the same period in 2016. We experienced slightly better margins due to the positive impact of TRU NIAGEN consumer product.\nFor full year 2017, operating expenses from continuing operations were $26.9 million, compared to $13.3 million from continuing operations for full year 2016 as we invested in marketing expenditures to build out the TRU NIAGEN brand. The increase in operating expenses was also due to legal costs associated with ongoing litigation and higher stock-based compensation expense.\nThe net loss attributable to common stockholders for full year 2017 was $11.4 million or ($0.26) per share as compared to a net loss of $2.9 million or ($0.08) per share for full year 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA a non-GAAP measure, was ($5.9) million for 2017, compared to adjusted EBITDA of ($0.9) million for 2016. The Basic and Diluted Adjusted EBITDA per share for 2017 was ($0.13) versus ($0.03) for 2016.\nOutlook\nFor 2018, the Company expects to show significant growth in sales driven by our U.S. ecommerce and Watsons business and the launch of TRU NIAGEN in new international markets. We expect the growth to be skewed toward the second half of the year. We will continue to invest in marketing expenditures to build out the TRU NIAGEN brand, infrastructure, and new capabilities to support growth.\nInvestor Conference Call\nChromaDex management will host an investor conference call to discuss the year end results and provide a general business update on Thurs., March 8, at 4:30pm ET.\nParticipants should call in at least 10 minutes prior to the call.
