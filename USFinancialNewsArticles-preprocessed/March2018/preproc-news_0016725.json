    "text": "LONDON, March 7 (Reuters) - British finance minister Philip Hammond said on Wednesday that any Brexit transition agreement with the European Union would need to be clear so businesses can make plans for the years ahead.\n“We look forward to a cooperative approach which ensures that the implementation period deal is not just delivered on paper but is delivered in a way that is usable and valuable to businesses so they can plan around it and move ahead with plans over the next three-odd years,” Hammond told reporters after delivering a speech in London.\nHe added that there was a great deal that the European Commission and regulators could do to provide reassurance for businesses.
