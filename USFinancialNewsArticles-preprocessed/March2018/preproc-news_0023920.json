FILE PHOTO: French fashion designer Hubert de Givenchy (L) attends the inauguration of the Cristobal Balenciaga museum in the Spanish couturier's home town of Getaria, June 7, 2011. REUTERS/Vincent West File Photo The announcement of his death came from the Givenchy fashion house, which is now owned by French luxury goods group LVMH. De Givenchy founded one of the worldâ€™s leading fashion houses in Paris in the 1950s and then struck out for New York, going on to build a business empire that became part of the LVMH empire when he sold up in at the end of the 1980s.
