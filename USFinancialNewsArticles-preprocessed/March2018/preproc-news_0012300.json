    "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn., March 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: CPIX), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on hospital acute care, gastroenterology, and oncology supportive care today announced fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results. Net Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $41.2 million, a 25% increase over the prior year period.\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had $93.2 million in total assets including $50.1 million in cash and investments. Total Liabilities were $29.3 million and Total Shareholder's Equity was $64.1 million. Cumberland also had fully reserved for $44.1 million in tax net operating loss carryforwards, resulting from the prior exercise of stock options.\n2017 Highlights:\nLaunched Totect ® in the U.S. with national distribution and promotion for the brand. Data from several favorable clinical trials published featuring Caldolor ® and Vaprisol ® . Initiated co-promotion support for Kristalose ® significantly expanding physician coverage. Advanced patient enrollment in Phase II Boxaban ® , Portaban ® and Vasculan ® clinical studies.\n\"These are exciting times at Cumberland as we progress on our key objectives,\" said A.J. Kazimi, Chief Executive Officer of Cumberland Pharmaceuticals. \"Our product portfolio has grown, our reach has substantially increased, and our pipeline now addresses several significant market opportunities. This diversified strategy has driven our double-digit top line growth over the past year. We enter 2018 with strong momentum and will work to continue our growth, improve our bottom line and progress our clinical programs.\"\nCumberland expanded its commercial product line in 2017 with the acquisition of exclusive U.S. rights to Totect ® (dexrazoxane hydrochloride). Totect is an FDA-approved, hospital based oncology intervention drug, indicated to treat the toxic effects of anthracycline chemotherapy. Totect was launched during a national shortage of dexrazoxane, resulting in strong initial demand for the brand. To support oncology patients during the shortage, Cumberland provided emergency shipments of the product to cancer centers and children's hospitals across the country.\nCaldolor and Vaprisol were the subject of favorable clinical publications in 2017. One study on Caldolor demonstrated its ability to significantly reduce fever in hospitalized children. Another study provided evidence that Caldolor can significantly improve post-operative pain control while also significantly reducing opioid use in patients undergoing surgery. Vaprisol was also highlighted in a publication as a well-tolerated solution for hyponatremia - a potentially serious condition that continues to be a leading type of electrolyte imbalance seen in hospitalized patients.\nDuring 2017, Cumberland also entered into a co-promotion arrangement with Poly Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Poly is a privately held U.S. specialty pharmaceutical company that is introducing Kristalose to medical specialties Cumberland doesn't cover - bringing the brand's message to thousands of new medical professionals.\nThe Company's clinical pipeline programs continued to advance in 2017. Patient enrollment progressed in the Phase II Vasculan and Portaban studies, and Cumberland initiated a follow-on Boxaban study in allergy and asthma centers across the U.S after FDA clearance earlier in the year.\nFINANCIAL RESULTS :\nNet Revenue: For the three months ended December 31, 2017, net revenues were $11.6 million, up 28% from $9.1 million for the prior year period. Net revenue by product for the three months ended December 31, 2017, included $3.4 million for Kristalose ® , $2.5 million for Ethyol ® , $2.2 million for Acetadote ® , including the Company's Authorized Generic, $1.4 million for Caldolor ® , $1.1 million for Totect ® , $0.6 million for Omeclamox ® -Pak, and $0.2 million for Vaprisol ® .\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net revenues were $41.2 million up 25% from $33.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nOperating Expenses: Total operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $12.6 million, compared to $10.0 million during the prior year period. Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $45.2 million, compared to $34.5 million for 2016. This change included increases in the royalties and cost of goods associated with the growth in sales.\nAdjusted Earnings: Adjusted Earnings for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $0.4 million, or $0.03 per share, compared to $(0.1) million, or $(0.01) per share in 2016. Adjusted Earnings for the full year ended December 31, 2017 were $0.1 million compared to $1.8 million, or $0.11 per share in 2016. This performance measure represents net income attributable to common shareholders with adjustments for the impact of income taxes, depreciation, amortization, share based compensation expenses, and non-recurring expenses. The definition and the reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings are provided in this release.\nDuring the fourth quarter the Company recorded a non-cash expense of $372,500 for the contribution of Cumberland shares to its newly formed charitable foundation. That expense is in addition to the $4.2 million in non-cash expense resulting from an increase in the valuation allowance for the Company's deferred tax assets.\nBalance Sheet: At December 31, 2017, Cumberland had $50.1 million in cash and marketable securities, with $45.4 million in cash and equivalents and $4.7 million in marketable securities. Total assets at December 31, 2017 were $93.2 million.

Used in the emergency department, Acetadote is approved in the United States to treat overdose of acetaminophen, a common ingredient in many over-the-counter medications. Acetadote is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity or previous anaphylactoid reactions to acetylcysteine or any components of the preparation. Serious anaphylactoid reactions, including death in a patient with asthma, have been reported in patients administered acetylcysteine intravenously. Acetadote should be used with caution in patients with asthma or where there is a history of bronchospasm. The total volume administered should be adjusted for patients weighing less than 40 kg and for those requiring fluid restriction. To avoid fluid overload, the volume of diluent should be reduced as needed. If volume is not adjusted, fluid overload can occur, potentially resulting in hyponatremia, seizure and death. For full prescribing information, visit www.acetadote.com .\nAbout Caldolor ® (ibuprofen) Injection\nCaldolor is indicated in adults and pediatric patients for the management of mild to moderate pain and management of moderate to severe pain as an adjunct to opioid analgesics, as well as the reduction of fever. It was the first FDA-approved intravenous therapy for fever.\nCaldolor is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to ibuprofen or other NSAIDs, patients with a history of asthma or other allergic type reactions after taking aspirin or other NSAIDs. Caldolor is contraindicated for use during the peri-operative period in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Caldolor should be used with caution in patients with prior history of ulcer disease or GI bleeding, in patients with fluid retention or heart failure, in the elderly, those with renal impairment, heart failure, liver impairment, and those taking diuretics or ACE inhibitors. Blood pressure should be monitored during treatment with Caldolor. For full prescribing information, including boxed warning, visit www.caldolor.com .\nAbout Kristalose ® (lactulose) Oral Solution\nKristalose is indicated for the treatment of acute and chronic constipation. It is a unique, proprietary, crystalline form of lactulose, with no restrictions on length of therapy or patient age. Initial dosing may produce flatulence and intestinal cramps, which are usually transient. Excessive dosage can lead to diarrhea with potential complications such as loss of fluids, hypokalemia and hypernatremia. Nausea and vomiting have been reported. Use with caution in diabetics.\nKristalose is contraindicated in patients who require a low-galactose diet. Elderly, debilitated patients who receive lactulose for more than six months should have serum electrolytes (potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide) measured periodically. For full prescribing information, visit www.kristalose.com .\nAbout Omeclamox ® -Pak (omeprazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin)\nOmeprazole is an antisecretory drug, which works by decreasing the amount of acid the stomach produces. Clarithromycin and amoxicillin are antibacterial drugs, which inhibit the growth of bacteria allowing the stomach lining to heal. Omeclamox-Pak is contraindicated in patients with a history of hypersensitivity to omeprazole, any macrolide antibiotic or penicillin. The safety and effectiveness of Omeclamox-Pak in the pediatric population has not yet been established. Omeclamox-Pak was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2011. For full prescribing information, visit www.omeclamox.com .\nAbout Vaprisol ® (conivaptan hydrochloride) Injection\nVaprisol is an intravenous treatment for hyponatremia used in the critical care setting. Hyponatremia is an electrolyte disturbance in which sodium ion concentration in blood plasma is lower than normal. This can be associated with a variety of critical care conditions including congestive heart failure, liver failure, kidney failure and pneumonia. The product is a vasopressin receptor antagonist that raises serum sodium levels and promotes free water secretion. Vaprisol was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2005 for euvolemic hyponatremia and in 2007 for hypervolemic hyponatremia. For full prescribing information, visit www.vaprisol.com .\nAbout Ethyol ® (amifostine) Injection\nEthyol is indicated to reduce the cumulative renal toxicity associated with repeated administration of cisplatin in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. It is indicated to reduce the incidence of moderate to severe xerostomia in patients undergoing post-operative radiation treatment for head and neck cancer, where the radiation port includes a substantial portion of the parotid glands.\nAbout Totect ® (dexrazoxane) Injection\nTotect is an anthracycline extravasation agent approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Anthracyclines are used to treat many types of cancer and are among the most common cancer therapies.\nExtravasation of anthracycline occurs when there is accidental leaking of the intravenously-administered medication into the surrounding tissues. Such extravasation can result in serious complications for cancer patients including tissue necrosis with skin ulceration. In addition to tissue damage, an anthracycline extravasation may cause damage to the nerves, tendons, muscle, and joints.

The definition of these supplemental measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others.\nBecause these supplemental financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the Company's reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review the Company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. A reconciliation of the supplemental financial measures to the most directly comparable is included in the tables accompanying this release.\nCumberland's management believes these supplemental financial performance measures are important as they are used by management, along with financial measures in accordance with GAAP, to evaluate the Company's operating performance. In addition, Cumberland believes that they will be used by certain investors to measure the Company's operating results. Management believes that presenting these supplemental measures provides useful information about the Company's underlying performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that Cumberland does not believe are indicative of its core business performance or reflect long-term strategic activities. Certain of these items are not settled through cash payments and include: depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation expense and income taxes. Cumberland utilizes its net operating loss carryforwards to pay minimal income taxes. In addition, the use of these financial measures provides greater transparency to investors of supplemental information used by management in its financial and operational decision-making, including the evaluation of the Company's operating performance.\nThe Company defines these supplemental financial measures as follows:\nAdjusted Earnings: net income (loss) adjusted for the impact of income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, share-based compensation expense and other income and interest expense.\n(a) Represents the share-based compensation of Cumberland.\n(b) Represents the expense of Cumberland shares donated to the Cumberland Pharma Foundation.\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share: Adjusted Earnings divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cumberland-pharmaceuticals-reports-25-revenue-growth-for-the-full-year-2017-300609226.html\nSOURCE Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc.",
