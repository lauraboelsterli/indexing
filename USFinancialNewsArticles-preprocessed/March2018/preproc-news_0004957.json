    "text": "Instant Pot is recalling one of its pressure cooker models because it can pose a fire hazard.\nThe distributor has received 107 reports of the Gem 65 8-in-1 multicooker overheating, including five instances when it caused minor property damage, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.\nNo injuries have been reported.\nThe recall is for Gem 65 8-in-1 model with batchcodes of 1728, 1730, 1731, 1734 or 1746 printed on the rating label underneath the multicooker.\nRead more from USA Today: \nJ.C. Penney slashes roughly 360 jobs, misses investors expectations\nNor'easter pounds East Coast; hurricane-strength winds possible \nThree Percenters: What is the gun-toting group? And what do its supporters want? \nThe Instant Pots, which cost approximately $80, were sold exclusively at Walmart stores across the country and at www.walmart.com between August 2017 and this past January.\nPeople who own these Gem 65 8-in-1 multicookers are advised to immediately stop using them and unplug them. They may be returned to Walmart for free replacements.\n\"The overheating is the result of a tooling misalignment during the manufacturing process, which created a gap between the bottom of the inner pot and the top surface of the heating plate in the product. This gap can cause the multicooker to overheat and melt on the underside, posing a fire hazard to consumers,\" Double Insight, the Ottawa-based importer and distributor of the multicooker said on its website.\nThe company said that people who own the recalled product and don't live near a Walmart store should contact Double Insight for a return shipping label and instructions for removing and returning the power cord and the rating label.\nFor more information, call 888-891-1473 8:30 a.m.-10 p.m. weekdays and 10 a.m.-6 p.m. weekends or go to www.gemmulticooker.com.\nThe affected multicooker is manufactured by Foshan Linshine Technology of Guangdong, China.",
