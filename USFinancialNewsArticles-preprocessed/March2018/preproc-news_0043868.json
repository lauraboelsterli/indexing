    "text": "MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia captain Steve Smith has been given a one-match suspension and fined 100 percent of his match fee for his part in ball-tampering incident during the third test against South Africa in Cape Town, the International Cricket Council said on Sunday.\nCricket - South Africa vs Australia - Third Test - Newlands, Cape Town, South Africa - March 25, 2018 Australia's Steve Smith REUTERS/Mike Hutchings Smith, who stepped down from the captaincy earlier on Sunday, had accepted the charge, cricket’s global governing body said in a statement.\n“The decision made by the leadership group of the Australian team to act in this way is clearly contrary to the spirit of the game, risks causing significant damage to the integrity of the match, the players and the sport itself and is therefore ‘serious’ in nature,” ICC chief executive David Richardson said.\n“As captain, Steve Smith must take full responsibility for the actions of his players and it is appropriate that he be suspended.”\nAustralia opener Cameron Bancroft has been fined 75 percent of his match fee and handed three demerit points after he was caught on camera tampering with the ball on day three of the test.\nReporting by Ian Ransom; Editing by Pritha Sarkar\n ",
