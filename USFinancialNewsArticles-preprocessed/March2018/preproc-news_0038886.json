Many of the EU’s arguments were rejected by a WTO adjudication panel last year, but the WTO’s appellate body reversed several of the points that the EU had lost previously. Russia had imposed duties of 29.6 percent on German van imports and 23 percent on imports from Italy in 2013, claiming they were unfairly priced to undermine Russian producers.
