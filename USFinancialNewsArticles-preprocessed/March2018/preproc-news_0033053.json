    "text": "MCLEAN, Va., March 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Iridium Communications Inc. (Nasdaq:IRDM) (the “Company”) today announced that it has priced $360 million in aggregate principal amount of its senior unsecured notes due 2023 (the “Notes”). The Notes will bear interest at 10.250% per annum and will mature on April 15, 2023. Interest will be payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2018. The closing of the offering of the Notes is expected to occur, subject to certain customary conditions, on March 21, 2018.\nThe Company plans to use the net proceeds of the offering to (i) make approximately $59.9 million of deferred payment obligations by repaying all amounts outstanding under Iridium Satellite LLC’s bills of exchange issued to Thales Alenia Space France (“Thales”), including interest and insurance, (ii) make approximately $44.4 million of milestone payments to Thales under the Full Scale System Development Contract No. ID-10-021 between Iridium Satellite and Thales when the applicable milestones have been met and (iii) fund approximately $87.0 million into the debt service reserve account under Iridium Satellite’s existing $1.8 billion credit facility (the “Credit Facility”). Any remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including fees and expenses relating to the amendment to the Credit Facility that will become effective upon the issuance of the Notes.\nThe Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States or to any U.S. persons absent registration under the Securities Act, or pursuant to an applicable exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. The Notes will be offered and sold only to persons reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers” under Rule 144A of the Securities Act or, outside the United States, to persons other than “U.S. persons” in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nThis press release does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes, nor shall there be any offer, solicitation or sale of any Notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. The Company gives no assurance that the proposed offering can be completed on any terms.\nAbout Iridium Communications Inc.\nIridium® is the only mobile voice and data satellite communications network that spans the entire globe.
