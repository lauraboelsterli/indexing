(Nasdaq: UNFI) (the “Company” or “UNFI”) today reported the second quarter of fiscal 2018 ended January 27, 2018.\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Highlights\nNet sales increased 10.6% to $2.53 billion compared to $2.29 billion for the same period last fiscal year Earnings per diluted common share increased $0.49 to $0.99 from $0.50 for the same period last fiscal year; Adjusted earnings per diluted common share was $0.71, excluding a provisional one-time benefit related to U.S. tax reform and restructuring and impairment charges Operating income decreased $6.1 million, or 13.1%, to $40.2 million compared to $46.3 million for the same period last fiscal year; Adjusted operating income, excluding restructuring and impairment charges, increased $5.2 million, or 11.2%, to $51.4 million Company raises fiscal 2018 guidance\n“Our business performed well during the quarter, and I’m proud of both our results and our people. While the retail landscape continues to change, I believe UNFI is well positioned to win. Consumer interest in better for you products has never been greater than it is today, and UNFI is an important connector between manufacturers, brick and mortar retailers and Ecommerce customers. Our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2018 remains strong,” said Steven L. Spinner, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Summary\nNet sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 10.6%, or $242.5 million, to $2.53 billion from $2.29 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nGross margin for the quarter was 14.70%, a 39 basis point decrease over last fiscal year’s second quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a shift in customer mix where sales growth with lower margin customers outpaced growth with other customers coupled with an increase in inbound freight costs.\nTotal operating expenses increased $32.6 million to $331.3 million, or 13.11% of net sales, for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $298.7 million, or 13.07% of net sales, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Included in total operating expenses in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 are restructuring and impairment expenses of approximately $11.2 million, primarily due to charges taken related to the Company’s Earth Origins Market retail business. Excluding these restructuring and impairment charges, adjusted operating expenses were $320.1 million, or 12.66% of net sales, for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The decrease in adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by leveraging of fixed costs on increased net sales, partially offset by increased labor costs incurred to fulfill the increased demand for the Company’s products.\nOperating income decreased $6.1 million, or 13.1%, to $40.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $46.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Excluding the restructuring and impairment charges noted above, adjusted operating income was $51.4 million, an increase of $5.2 million, or 11.2%, compared to the same period last fiscal year.\nThe Company expects the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), enacted in December 2017, will have a favorable impact on both the Company’s reported and adjusted effective rates in fiscal 2018. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a provisional one-time non-cash net tax benefit of $21.9 million, or $0.43 per diluted common share, representing the estimated impact of the remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax liabilities based on the new lower corporate income tax rate contemplated by the Tax Act. In addition, the Company realized a cash and earnings benefit of $7.3 million resulting from the 21% federal statutory rate reduction going into effect on January 1, 2018. As a result, the Company’s effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased to a negative rate of 38.4% from a positive rate of 39.4% in the same period last fiscal year. Excluding the provisional one-time net tax benefit of $21.9 million resulting from passage of the Tax Act, the Company’s adjusted effective tax rate decreased to 21.6% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nNet income for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 increased $25.0 million, or 98.1%, to $50.5 million, or $0.99 per diluted common share, from $25.5 million, or $0.50 per diluted common share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The ongoing benefit of the 21% federal tax rate resulting from the passage of the Tax Act contributed approximately $0.14 per diluted common share in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Excluding the restructuring and impairment charges noted above and the provisional one-time tax benefit resulting from passage of the Tax Act, adjusted earnings per diluted common share was $0.71, an increase of $0.21, or 42.0%, over the same period last fiscal year.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was $73.3 million, an increase of 8.5% from $67.5 million in the same period last fiscal year.\nCash flow from operations was $36.9 million and capital expenditures were $10.3 million, resulting in free cash flow of $26.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Cash flow from operations was $104.2 million and capital expenditures were $13.5 million, resulting in free cash flow of $90.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nFiscal 2018 Year to Date Summary\nNet sales for the 26-week period ended January 27, 2018 totaled $4.99 billion, a 9.2% increase over the comparable prior fiscal year period.\nGross margin for the 26-week period ended January 27, 2018 decreased 39 basis points to 14.82% compared to 15.21% for the 26-week period ended January 28, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to a shift in customer mix where sales growth with lower margin customers outpaced growth with other customers coupled with an increase in inbound freight costs.\nTotal operating expenses for the 26-week period ended January 27, 2018 increased $49.1 million to $643.4 million from $594.4 million for the 26-week period ended January 28, 2017. At 12.91% of net sales, total operating expenses for the 26-week period ended January 27, 2018, which includes $11.2 million of restructuring and impairment expense, were 11 basis points lower than the comparable prior fiscal year period. The year-over-year decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily driven by leveraging of fixed costs on increased net sales. This was partially offset by restructuring and impairment charges and increased costs incurred to fulfill the increased demand for the Company’s products.\nOperating income for the 26-week period ended January 27, 2018 decreased $4.3 million, or 4.3%, to $95.3 million from $99.6 million for the 26-week period ended January 28, 2017. Excluding restructuring and impairment charges noted above, adjusted operating income increased 7.0% to $106.6 million for the 26-week period ended January 27, 2018, up from $99.6 million for the same prior fiscal year period.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate decreased to 8.9% for the 26-week period ended January 27, 2018 from 39.6% for the same period last fiscal year. Excluding the provisional one-time net tax benefit of $21.9 million as a result of the Tax Act, the adjusted effective tax rate for the 26-week period ended January 27, 2018 was 33.5%.\nNet income for the 26-week period ended January 27, 2018 increased $26.3 million, or 48.1%, to $81.0 million, or $1.59 per diluted common share, from $54.7 million, or $1.08 per diluted common share for the 26-week period ended January 28, 2017. Excluding the restructuring and impairment charges and the provisional one-time tax benefit resulting from the passage of the Tax Act explained above, adjusted earnings per diluted common share was $1.31 for the 26-week period ended January 27, 2018, an increase of $0.23, or 21.3%, over the 26-week period ended January 28, 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2018 was $150.8 million, an increase of 6.1% from $142.1 million in the same period last fiscal year.\nCash flow used in operations was $35.1 million and capital expenditures were $15.5 million, resulting in negative free cash flow of $50.7 million for the 26-week period ended January 27, 2018. Cash flow from operations was $96.9 million and capital expenditures were $22.7 million, resulting in free cash flow of $74.2 million for the 26-week period ended January 28, 2017.\nFiscal 2018 Guidance\nBased on UNFI’s performance to date, the impact of tax reform contemplated by the Tax Act and the outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2018, the Company is raising its guidance previously provided on December 7, 2017. For fiscal 2018, ending July 28, 2018, the Company now estimates net sales in the range of approximately $10.01 billion to $10.16 billion, an increase of 8.0% to 9.5% over fiscal 2017 net sales, compared to the previous estimate of $9.84 billion to $10.00 billion. The Company now estimates earnings per diluted common share for fiscal 2018 in the range of approximately $3.27 to $3.35, an increase of approximately 27.7% to 30.9% over fiscal 2017 earnings per diluted common share of $2.56, compared to the previous estimate of $2.72 to $2.80. Adjusting for restructuring and impairment charges and the impact of the one-time tax benefit related to the remeasurement of U.S. net deferred tax liabilities resulting from U.S. tax reform, the Company estimates adjusted earnings per diluted common share for fiscal 2018 in the range of approximately $3.06 to $3.14, an increase of approximately 19.5% to 22.7% over fiscal 2017 earnings per diluted common share. The estimated GAAP and adjusted earnings per diluted common share outlook reflect the ongoing estimated benefits from the Tax Act. On a GAAP basis, the Company estimates its effective tax rate to be in the range of 23.8% to 24.3% and its adjusted effective tax rate to be in the range of 33.0% to 33.3%, compared to previous guidance of 40.0% to 40.3%. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 are expected to be 0.6% to 0.7% of estimated fiscal 2018 net sales.\nThe Company’s guidance is based on current plans and expectations and is subject to a number of known and unknown uncertainties and risks, including those set forth under the Company’s safe harbor statement of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 below.\nAdjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted earnings per diluted common share, adjusted effective tax rate, and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the tables in this press release for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nConference Call & Webcast\nThe Company’s second quarter fiscal 2018 conference call and audio webcast will be held today, Thursday, March 8, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. EST.
