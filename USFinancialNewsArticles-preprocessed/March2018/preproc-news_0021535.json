    "text": "WARSAW, March 7 (Reuters) - Polandâ€™s central bank slightly cut on Wednesday its inflation forecasts for 2018 and 2019, but said inflation would then likely accelerate to a range of 1.9-4.1 percent in 2020.\nThe central bank, following its decision to keep interest rates unchanged earlier on Wednesday, reiterated that the current level of rates has helped keep Poland on a path of balanced economic growth.\nThe bank targets inflation at 2.5 percent with a plus-minus 1 percentage point band of allowed fluctuations.
