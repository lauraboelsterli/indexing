    "text": "Philippe Desmazes | AFP | Getty Images British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee \nThe Facebook data scandal is a \"serious moment\" for the future of the internet, but \"bugs are created by people, and can be fixed by people,\" the inventor of the World Wide Web said Thursday. \nFacebook is suffering from the fallout related to an app developer's unauthorized sharing of data from 50 million users with a politically connected firm, Cambridge Analytica. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologized Wednesday and outlined how the social media giant will boost measures to protect data . \nIn a tweet Thursday, Tim Berners-Lee, who created the World Wide Web, called the scandal a \"serious moment\" in the internet's future but struck a positive note. \nHe empathized with Zuckerberg, and said that he was likely feeling \"devastated.\" But there was a fix. TWEET \nBerners-Lee called for tighter controls over data use by companies. He said that a person's data should be theirs alone \"to control.\" \nThe computer scientist struck a positive tone and urged internet users to talk to government representatives and tell them that data matters.
