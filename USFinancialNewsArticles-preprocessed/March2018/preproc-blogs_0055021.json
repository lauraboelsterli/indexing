    "text": "Scott Mlyn | CNBC Kevin Plank, CEO, Under Armour \nShares of Under Armour dropped 3.8 percent, before paring losses, after the active-wear company informed users of its online fitness and nutrition website of a data breach. \nUnder Armour announced on Thursday that an estimated 150 million users of its food and nutrition application MyFitnessPal may have their data compromised. \nThe investigation indicates that affected information may include usernames, email addresses, and hashed passwords. \nThe affected data includes neither payment information, which Under Armour collects and processes separately, nor government identifiers, like social security numbers and driver's license numbers, as the app does not collect that information. \nUnder Armour first became aware of a potential breach on March 25, when company discovered an unauthorized party had accessed MyFitnessPal user data in February. Under Armour took steps to notify affected users, and is now is working with data security firms and law enforcement to assist in its investigation. \nThis story is developing, please check back for more information.",
