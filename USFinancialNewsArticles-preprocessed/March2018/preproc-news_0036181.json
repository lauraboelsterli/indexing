    "text": "FedEx has a new service aimed at helping ease the returns process for merchants and e-tailers.\nMemphis-based FedEx Corp. announced Monday, March 19, the launch of FedEx Returns Technology. The new offering is intended to provide companies \"complete visibility into returns.\" Via this service, merchants can track shipments, manage inventory and analyze trends and customer behavior.\nMore from Memphis Business Journal:\nBehind the Scenes: HBO Elvis film screens at Guesthouse at Graceland\nPolice: Austin bomber may be using commercial shippers\n'Radical new charging technology' sparks UPS switch to all electric fleet in London\n\"Returns have rapidly evolved into a critical factor second only to cost, in satisfying today's e-commerce customers,\" said Ryan Kelly, senior vice president of FedEx Supply Chain, in a release. \"FedEx Returns Technology bridges the gap between digital and physical, allowing merchants to define a returns strategy that works for their business model and for their customers.\"\nCustomers are able to drop off returns that can be inspected and packed through FedEx Returns Technology at 1,700 participating FedEx Office locations across the U.S. Some customers could also see a faster credit refund as a result.\nThis news comes in the wake of a huge announcement from the logistics and delivery company, that it plans to invest $1 billion for modernization updates to its Memphis SuperHub. That project is expected to start in 2019 and finish in 2025.",
