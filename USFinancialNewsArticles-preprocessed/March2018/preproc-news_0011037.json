    "text": "1 COMMENTS U.S. regulators may have given Qualcomm ’s QCOM -2.92% investors the gift of time. But Broadcom AVGO 1.62% might be the one to make better use of it.\nThe gift of time came over the weekend, in the form of a surprise move by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S.—or CFIUS—to review Broadcom’s proposed takeover of Qualcomm just two days before Qualcomm’s shareholders were due to vote on the matter. That vote, between re-electing Qualcomm’s board of directors and an alternative slate proposed by Broadcom, will now be put off for at least a month, per the order from CFIUS.\nA review is relatively unprecedented before the two sides even come to an agreement on a merger. But this isn’t a normal deal. The merger of Qualcomm and Broadcom would be the largest M&A deal in history and would create one of the world’s largest semiconductor businesses. As such, the proposal has always faced a significant risk that regulators could say no—or demand concessions that would make the combination unappealing.\nThe early review from CFIUS serves as the best indicator yet that this deal won’t easily pass muster. Granted, Broadcom has plenty of experience in global acquisitions and has dealt with CFIUS before—most recently in its acquisition of Brocade . The company was also already working to redomicile in the U.S. and out of Singapore, which was a flag of convenience anyway. Hock Tan, Broadcom’s Malaysian-born CEO , is a U.S. citizen who graduated from Harvard and currently lives and works in Silicon Valley.\nBut even a favorable review from CFIUS wouldn’t fully remove the significant regulatory risk the deal faces. The combined company would have enormous market power over key components used in wireless devices. That will make other regulators across the globe eye this deal closely. Those could include the Federal Trade Commission as well as regulators in Europe and China—the latter of which is home to fast-growing wireless device manufacturers who have already voiced opposition to the deal.\nIf the deal comes to a vote, Qualcomm’s investors should still tread cautiously. Broadcom, meanwhile, should use the extra time reassess its pursuit of Qualcomm. Broadcom has shed about $11 billion in market value since it first announced its bid. Its stock price is also about 23% below the median target set by Wall Street’s analysts—nearly all of whom believe the company will do just fine without Qualcomm . U.S. regulators may or may not be intending to show Broadcom the exit door. The company should consider taking it regardless.\nWrite to Dan Gallagher at dan.gallagher@wsj.com",
