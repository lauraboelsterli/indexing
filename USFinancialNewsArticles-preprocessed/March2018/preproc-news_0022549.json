The stock was up 3.1 percent.\nThe UAE healthcare provider reported a 38.2 percent rise in annual net profit on Wednesday and said acquisitions this year could top the $641 million it spent in 2017.\nVodafone was a weak spot, down 0.6 percent, after Bernstein analyst downgraded the stock to market perform.\nOn the midcap index, Renewi fell 6 percent after the waste-to-product company said it would take an impairment charge following the review of contracts in its UK municipal division.\nInmarsat fell 5 percent after a quarterly update whioch was in line with expectations. Morgan Stanley analysts said comments around its government business were cautious, indicating that consensus expectations for 2019 revenue growth of 5 percent were too high.\nGVC Holdings rose 3.3 percent after the online gambling firm saw full-year net gaming revenue rise 17 percent in 2017, helped by gains from the bwin.party businesses it bought three years ago. GVC is set to take over Britain’s largest bookmaker Ladbrokes Coral. (Reporting by Danilo Masoni Editing by Keith Weir)\n ",
