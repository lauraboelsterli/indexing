    "text": "GETTYSBURG, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Board of Directors of ACNB Corporation recently approved and declared the payment of the regular quarterly cash dividend. The cash dividend of $0.23 per share is payable on June 15, 2018, to shareholders of record on June 1, 2018. This per share amount reflects a 15% increase and will result in aggregate dividend payments of more than $1.6 million to ACNB Corporation shareholders in the second quarter of 2018. In comparison to a year ago, ACNB Corporation paid a $0.20 dividend per share in the second quarter of 2017.\n“ACNB Corporation has a long history of rewarding its shareholders with a solid quarterly cash dividend even through the economic recession,” said James P. Helt, ACNB Corporation President & Chief Executive Officer. “For the second quarter of 2018, the Board of Directors is pleased to announce a 15% increase in the dividend amount from $0.20 to $0.23 per share. This is a significant commitment to ACNB Corporation shareholders and the direct result of the success of the Corporation’s acquisition and integration of New Windsor Bancorp, Inc. and its banking subsidiary, New Windsor State Bank, in July 2017, as well as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in December 2017.”\n“The good news is that the acquisition and tax reform have produced both current and future benefits for ACNB Corporation and its shareholders. In addition, our banking and insurance operations continue to be fundamentally strong. The Corporation’s executive management is also looking to continue its efforts to invest in employees and organizational infrastructure---all in support of the Corporation’s vision to be the independent financial services provider of choice in the core markets served by building relationships and finding solutions,” Mr. Helt added.\nACNB Corporation, headquartered in Gettysburg, PA, is the financial holding company for the wholly-owned subsidiaries of ACNB Bank, Gettysburg, PA, and Russell Insurance Group, Inc., Westminster, MD.
