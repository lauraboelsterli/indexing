    "text": "SAN MATEO, Calif., March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, OneSignal, a push notification platform supporting mobile app and web publishers, is proud to announce that Bryan Smith has been hired as Senior Director of Engineering and Kevin Weatherman has been promoted to Chief Revenue Officer.\nOneSignal sends over two billion daily notifications on behalf of 350,000 developers, and has tripled the number of developers they support in less than one year. Since announcing a Series A in August 2017, OneSignal has doubled the size of their team and moved their headquarters to San Mateo. This month, OneSignal hired Bryan Smith as Senior Director of Engineering to help lead and expand the engineering team.\n\"Managing this scale and growth has required us to set aggressive goals, and to build a culture that values ownership and solving hard problems. Getting to know Bryan over several years I came to greatly admire his technical and leadership skills. Frankly, Bryan is awesome. I can't think of anyone better suited to tackle the challenges ahead,\" says OneSignal CEO, George Deglin.\nBryan joins OneSignal with 15 years of experience building software products and engineering teams across multiple technology sectors. Bryan previously worked at Symphony as Senior Director of Engineering, where he joined as an early employee to scale and lead engineering across mobile, web and special projects for large enterprise customers. During his time there, Symphony grew to hundreds of employees and raised over $200 million in funding from Google and others. Prior to Symphony, Bryan worked on cross-platform development tools for mobile publishers.\nIn addition to greatly expanding the number of supported developers, OneSignal has more than doubled revenue through significant increases in enterprise clients and data partnerships. In recognition of his contributions across the organization, OneSignal has promoted Kevin Weatherman to Chief Revenue Officer.\n\"Kevin has been instrumental in helping to build OneSignal's publisher audience, establish important partnerships, run our New York office, and accelerate our revenue growth. Kevin's experience and drive for excellence have helped us build a strong and rapidly growing business. I'm looking forward to having him continue to lead our business team as CRO,\" said Deglin.\nKevin joined OneSignal in 2016 as VP of Business Development with 10 years of experience working with software publishers and advertising technology. Kevin previously worked at MoPub as VP of Business Development, joining as the first business hire and building MoPub's business team in New York (We're Hiring). In October 2013, MoPub was acquired by Twitter where Kevin remained as Director of Global Strategic Publisher Sales.\nOneSignal is continuing to expand their team and looking to fill roles including Sales, Account Management, Product Management, DevOps, Systems Engineering, and Full Stack Development.\nOneSignal is a startup that makes it simple for developers to add personalized mobile and web push notifications for free. OneSignal is a team of 20 located in San Mateo, California and New York City, and has raised $9.5 million in funding from Signalfire, Rakuten Ventures, Y Combinator, SV Angel, Start Fund, and angel investors including Justin Kan and Zach Coelius.\nMedia Contact: pr@onesignal.com\nRelated Links\nMore about OneSignal, Inc.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/onesignal-hires-bryan-smith-as-senior-director-of-engineering-promotes-kevin-weatherman-to-chief-revenue-officer-300606643.html\nSOURCE OneSignal, Inc.",
