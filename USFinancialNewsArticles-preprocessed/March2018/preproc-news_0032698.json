    "text": "March 17, 2018 / 11:52 PM / Updated 11 hours ago All Blacks flanker Squire out for six weeks with broken thumb Reuters Staff 2 Min Read WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Otago Highlanders and All Blacks flanker Liam Squire will be out of action for the next six weeks after he broke his thumb in his side’s 25-17 victory over the Canterbury Crusaders on Saturday. Squire suffered the injury just before halftime in the pulsating Super Rugby clash in Dunedin. He also broke his thumb during Super Rugby last year and was out for a similar amount of time. The 26-year-old’s return is timetabled for the Highlanders’ matches in South Africa against the Bulls on April 28 and the Sharks on May 5. Squire became All Blacks coach Steve Hansen’s first-choice blindside flanker last year, effectively ending stalwart Jerome Kaino’s international career. Elliot Dixon replaced Squire on Saturday against the defending champions and provided a second-half spark for his side, who were far more controlled and precise after a frenetic first half. The Highlanders, who are unbeaten and lead the highly competitive New Zealand conference, face the Hurricanes next week in Wellington. Reporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Ed Osmond",
