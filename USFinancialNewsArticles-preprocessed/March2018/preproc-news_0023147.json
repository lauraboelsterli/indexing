    "text": "TOKYO, March 12 (Reuters) - Japanese government bond prices were little changed on Monday, with downward pressure from higher stocks neutralised by the Bank of Japan’s regular debt-buying operation.\nThe five-year and 10-year JGB yields were unchanged at minus 0.120 percent and 0.045 percent, respectively. The 30-year yield inched up half a basis point to 0.760 percent .\nThe BOJ on Monday bought 710 billion yen ($6.66 billion) of five- to 40-year JGBs as part of its regular debt-purchasing scheme.\nThe JGB market showed little reaction as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Finance Minister Aso Taro came under renewed fire over suspicions of cronyism involving sale of state-owned land.\nWhile the immediate response was muted, analysts said the scandal could have a negative effect on JGBs if it spells trouble for Aso.\nJapan’s Nikkei was up 1.7 percent following a rally on Wall Street on Friday. ($1 = 106.6100 yen) (Reporting by the Tokyo markets team; Editing by Sunil Nair)\n ",
