    "text": "Full year 2017 Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA A increased approximately 93% and 506%, respectively year-over-year Revenue, Net Loss and Adjusted EBITDA of $154.3, $(29.8) million and $18.7 million, respectively for fourth quarter of 2017\nHOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Nine Energy Service, Inc. (\"Nine\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: NINE) reported fourth quarter 2017 revenues of $154.3 million, net loss of $(29.8) million and adjusted EBITDA of $18.7 million. Fourth quarter 2017 revenues increased approximately 93% as compared to the fourth quarter 2016 revenues of $80.0 million. Fourth quarter net loss was $(29.8) million as compared to a net loss of $(25.8) million in the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily as a result of the goodwill impairment described below. Fourth quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA increased from fourth quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA of $5.2 million by approximately 258% and represented the fourth sequential quarterly increase. The Company had projected fourth quarter 2017 revenue between $150.0 and $152.0 million and adjusted EBITDA between $15.3 and $16.2 million, with actual results outperforming the midpoint of fourth quarter 2017 revenue projections by approximately 2% and the midpoint of fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA projections by approximately 19%.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported revenues of $543.7 million compared to year ended December 31, 2016 revenues of $282.4 million, representing an approximate 93% increase. The net loss for full year 2017 totaled $(67.7) million, or $(4.55) loss per diluted share B , compared to year ended December 31, 2016 net loss of $(70.9) million, or $(5.34) loss per diluted share. The Company reported year ended December 31, 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $59.6 million, compared to year ended December 31, 2016 adjusted EBITDA of $9.8 million, representing an approximate 506% increase.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company reported a net loss of $(29.8) million, or $(1.89) loss per diluted share, which includes goodwill and intangible impairments of $35.3 million associated with the Bakken open hole sleeve business. The impairment is a result of a sustained completion methodology shift in the Bakken Shale from open hole to cemented plug n’ perf applications. This compares to reported net loss in the fourth quarter of 2016 of $(25.8) million, or $(1.94) loss per diluted share.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company generated an ROIC C of (5)%, compared to an ROIC of (4)% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Exclusive of the goodwill and intangibles impairment, ROIC for the fourth quarter 2017 was 2%. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company generated an ROIC of (11)%.\nNine’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Ann Fox, commented, \"We realized tremendous growth in 2017 by remaining focused on providing our customers with excellent service execution and cutting-edge technology. Despite a decrease in U.S. rig count quarter-over-quarter, we were able to grow revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the fourth sequential quarter in a row, beating the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA expectations by approximately 19%. Working for the most efficient customers and completing the most complex and technical wells enables us to differentiate ourselves in the market from a technology and tool conveyance perspective. We benefit directly from the secular trends in the completions space and we anticipate the high-level of completion intensity to continue as lateral lengths extend helping to drive top-line growth and margin, while also creating unique operating efficiencies within Nine. These efficiencies will provide a competitive advantage as labor and equipment remains extremely tight.”\n“We are continuing to supplement our technology portfolio with both internal R&D and strategic alliances. Most recently, we signed an exclusive distribution agreement with a technology company for casing flotation tools with field trials starting in the first quarter of 2018 in the Northeast. Additionally, we are in the middle of trialing our EON XLR frac sleeve system. Both of these tools fit nicely into our ‘deep-reach’ technology portfolio and we will remain focused on sourcing and developing technology throughout 2018.”\n“I am extremely proud of our team and what we have accomplished this year after a very difficult downturn for the industry. We exceeded both our financial and operational expectations in 2017 and have positioned the company for continued success this year. The macro outlook remains positive and we believe supply-demand fundamentals support additional activity in 2018 as capital continues to flow into North American shale. Our first quarter of 2018 is progressing as we anticipated, and we are optimistic about 2018. We will continue to follow our returns-based growth strategy into the remainder of 2018 and expect to improve ROIC through disciplined capital deployment and controlled growth to ensure our standard of excellence at the wellsite.”\nInitial Public Offering\nIn January 2018, Nine completed its IPO of 8,050,000 shares of common stock, including 1,050,000 shares pursuant to an over-allotment option, at a price of $23.00 per share. The aggregate gross proceeds of the IPO were $185.2 million with net proceeds to the Company of approximately $169.5 million. Concurrently, with the consummation of the IPO, Nine’s new credit facility became effective, consisting of $125 million of term loan commitments and $50 million of revolving credit commitments. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds, together with $125.0 million of term loan borrowings under its new credit facility to fully repay the outstanding debt. Nine’s credit agreement required that the Company use a portion of the proceeds from the over-allotment option to make a repayment of the term loan borrowings of $9.7 million.\nBusiness Segment Results\nCompletion Solutions\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company’s Completion Solutions segment, which includes the Company’s cementing, completion tools, wireline and coiled tubing services reported revenues of $134.7 million compared to fourth quarter 2016 revenues of $64.7 million, representing an approximate 108% increase. For the fourth quarter 2017, Completion Solutions reported adjusted gross profit D of $25.8 million compared to fourth quarter 2016 adjusted gross profit of $10.2 million, representing an approximate 153% increase.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Completion Solutions reported revenues of $465.8 million compared to year ended December 31, 2016 revenues of $221.5 million, representing an approximate 110% increase. Completion Solutions reported year ended December 31, 2017 adjusted gross profit of $81.1 million, compared to year ended December 31, 2016 adjusted gross profit of $27.0 million, representing an approximate 200% increase.\nProduction Solutions\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company’s Production Solutions segment, which includes well services generated revenues of $19.6 million compared to fourth quarter 2016 revenues of $15.3 million, representing an approximate 28% increase. For the fourth quarter 2017, Production Solutions reported adjusted gross profit of $2.9 million compared to fourth quarter 2016 adjusted gross profit of $2.4 million, representing an approximate 23% increase.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Production Solutions reported revenues of $77.9 million compared to year ended December 31, 2016 revenues of $60.9 million, representing an approximate 28% increase. Production Solutions reported year ended December 31, 2017 adjusted gross profit of $14.1 million, compared to year ended December 31, 2016 adjusted gross profit of $9.2 million, representing an approximate 53% increase.\nOther Financial Information\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company reported selling, general and administrative expense of $11.9 million, compared to $13.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported selling, general and administrative expense of $49.6 million, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 selling, general and administrative expense of $39.4. This increase was due in part to the additional costs associated with the Company’s merger with Beckman Production Services, Inc. (the “Combination”), the Company’s preparation for its IPO and increase in stock-based compensation and bonus expense.\nDepreciation and amortization expense (\"D&A\") in the fourth quarter of 2017 was $15.3 million, compared to $15.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported D&A expense of $62.2 million, compared to year ended December 31, 2016 D&A expense of $64.3 million.\nThe Company recognized an income tax benefit of approximately $8.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and an overall income tax benefit for the year of approximately $5.0 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 6.9% for 2017. The fourth quarter tax benefit was primarily attributable to a change in the Company’s deferred taxes due to goodwill impairment associated with the Bakken open hole sleeve business, discussed above. The Company also accounted for the recently enacted U.S. tax reform legislation, which resulted in an additional net non-cash income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of revaluing its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities from 35% to the reduced rate of 21%.\nLiquidity\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported net cash provided by operating activities of $5.7 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 net cash used by operations of $(3.3) million.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, total capital expenditures were $15.2 million compared to total capital expenditures of $2.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported total capital expenditures of $45.2 million of which approximately 21% related to maintenance capital expenditures, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 total capital expenditures of $9.1 million of which approximately 42% related to maintenance capital expenditures.\nWith the proceeds from the IPO, on an “as adjusted” basis, Nine’s cash and cash equivalents increased by $43.3 million to $60.9 million. In addition, concurrently with the consummation of the IPO, Nine’s new credit facility became effective, which includes $50.0 million of revolver capacity, $49.4 million of which is currently available; resulting in a total liquidity position of $110.3 million as of December 31, 2017 on an as adjusted basis.\nConference Call Information\nThe call is scheduled for Thursday, March 29, 2018 at 10:00 am Central Time.

Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it allows us to more effectively evaluate our operating performance and compare the results of our operations from period to period without regard to our financing methods or capital structure.\nB All share data reflect the 8.0256 for 1 stock split that took place in January 2018\nC ROIC is defined as after-tax net operating profit, divided by average total capital. We define after-tax net operating profit as income (loss) from continuing operations (net of tax) plus interest expense, less taxes on interest. We define total capital as book value of equity plus the book value of debt less balance sheet cash and cash equivalents. We then take the average of the current and prior year-end total capital for use in this analysis. Management believes ROIC is a meaningful measure because it quantifies how well we generate operating income relative to the capital we have invested in our business and illustrates the profitability of a business or project taking into account the capital invested. Management uses ROIC to assist them in capital resource allocation decisions and in evaluating business performance.\nD Adjusted gross profit is defined as revenues less cost of revenues excluding depreciation and amortization. This measure differs from the GAAP definition of gross profit because we do not include the impact of depreciation and amortization, which represent non-cash expenses. Our management uses adjusted gross profit to evaluate operating performance and to determine resource allocation between segments. We prepare adjusted gross profit (excluding depreciation and amortization) to eliminate the impact of depreciation and amortization because we do not consider depreciation and amortization indicative of our core operating performance.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180328006168/en/\nNine Energy Service, Inc.\nHeather Schmidt, 281-730-5113\nDirector, Investor Relations and Marketing\ninvestors@nineenergyservice.com\nSource: Nine Energy Service, Inc.",
