Shares in pharma firm Shire surged.\nShire Plc jumped around 14 percent after Japan’s Takeda Pharmaceutical Co said it was considering a possible offer for the London-listed drugmaker.\n“We see the possible strategic fit given the Japanese pharma’s focus therapeutic areas of oncology, gastrointestinal and neuroscience, with Shire bolstering the latter two franchises,” analysts at Jefferies said in a note.\nThe gains in Shire helped the FTSE recover early losses, as bad news about U.S. tech giants and fears of a trade war fuelled concern over valuations across global equities.\nThe FTSE 100 index ended up 0.6 percent at 7,044.74 points, whereas Europe’s STOXX 600 index rose 0.3 percent. Demand for defensive, bond-proxy-type stocks offset falls among cyclical sectors such as mining and energy. British mid caps fell 0.2 percent.\nGlobal trade tensions hit the value of key metals such as copper, and a surprise increase in U.S. crude inventories sent Brent crude futures back below $70 a barrel.\nTech stocks have come under pressure amid signs regulators might rein in the sector following years of strong growth and privacy concerns around Facebook and Google.\nFacebook shares are now down 14 percent this month.\n“Everyone wants to know how far this tech sell-off has to go and how much it affects everyone else,” said IG’s Chris Beauchamp. “People can cope with a modest sell-off, but when you get to these proportions and it hits the strongest performers so hard ... it sends the signal that others can be vulnerable, too.”\nDefensive stocks such as utilities, however, gained as investors bought back into sectors that have been relatively unloved as bond yields marched higher, rendering their big dividends less attractive.\nUnilever was among top FTSE gainers, rising 4.7 percent after UBS upgraded the consumer goods giant to “buy” on expectations of improving volume growth and operating margin expansion.\nCapita rose 1.5 percent after a person familiar with the matter said the outsourcing firm would publish a five-year transformation plan and details of a rights issue with its annual results on April 26.\nReporting by Tom Pfeiffer and Kit Rees; Editing by Larry King and Mark Potter\n ",
