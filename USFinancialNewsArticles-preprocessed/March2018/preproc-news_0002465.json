    "text": "After raising $11 million in Series A funding, Roomi acquires their third room rental/roommate matching company\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Roomi , the leading room rental marketplace, announced today the acquisition of New York’s premier roommate matching service, Symbi . Symbi was founded in 2014 to create and deliver a new way for roommate-seekers to find a compatible match, quickly and safely.\nThe acquisition follows Roomi’s $11 million Series A raise announcement bringing their total funding to date to $17 million. Roomi launched in 2015 and today has over 1 million registered users and is available in major cities across the US and Canada. Before Symbi, Roomi has also acquired roommate matching and room rental platforms, The Room Ring in 2017 and Room.me in 2016.\n“We believe the future of living is going to be shared housing but there is still a lot of work that needs to get done to truly solve the problems millennials are encountering in the rental markets today,” said Ajay Yadav, CEO & Founder of Roomi. “Acquiring Symbi enables Roomi to continue building a better product so millions can find a safer way to search for room rentals and compatible roommates.”\nSymbi users will be transitioned to the Roomi platform over time to contribute to the Roomi user network and benefit from Roomi’s large supply of room rental listings.\n\"When we were building Symbi, we observed first-hand the power of network effects. The single most impactful thing that we did to improve our users' experience was getting more potential roommates for them to interact with. By joining forces with Roomi, our users can now tap into the broader Roomi ecosystem to find their perfect roommate match,” said Symbi co-founders Simone Kalmakis and Peter Kalmakis. “We have gotten to know Ajay and his team over the past few years, and are confident that the Symbi community is in good hands.\"\nAbout Roomi:\nRoomi is a peer-to-peer marketplace making it safer and easier for young people in large cities to search for room rentals, sublets and roommates. Users are easily able to list their place, then Roomi verifies every listing and offers additional safety features, like background checks. After browsing, potential roommates can instantly apply to move-in and securely pay the first month's rent.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180301005263/en/\nRoomi\nCarli Evilsizer\nBrand & Communications Manager\ncarli@roomiapp.com\nSource: Roomi",
