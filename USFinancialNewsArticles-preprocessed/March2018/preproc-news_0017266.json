    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Rolls-Royce would be interested in providing an engine for any new middle of the market jet, its chief executive said on Wednesday, if doing so made commercial sense.\nFILE PHOTO: Warren East, CEO of Rolls-Royce, poses for a portrait at the company's aerospace engineering and development site in Bristol, Britain, December 17, 2015. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo Boeing is studying a gap between narrow-body jets and long-haul aircraft for a potential new mid-market airplane that could seat 220 to 260 passengers.\nRolls-Royce currently specializes in making engines for bigger planes, which carry more passengers.\n“We’re in the business of selling engines and so naturally we would want to go after that opportunity if it makes commercial sense,” CEO Warren East told analysts on Wednesday, after the company reported a 25 percent jump in annual profits.\n“Strategically it makes perfect sense for us to go after that and that’s what we’re doing,” he said.\nReporting by Sarah Young, Editing by Paul Sandle\n ",
