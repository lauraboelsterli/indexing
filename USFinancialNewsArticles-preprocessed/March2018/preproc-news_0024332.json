This level of revenue led to positive quarterly operating income for the first time in eight quarters.\nAfter a decline in earnings over the last three years, we recorded a 10% increase in revenue and a 14% growth in EBITDA for the full year 2017, demonstrating the effectiveness and success of our industrial Transformation Plan, particularly the sharp reduction in our cost base.\nFollowing the approval of the safeguard plan in France and the exit from Chapter 11 in the United States at the end of February, our financial restructuring is now finalized. At the closing of the financial restructuring and on a pro forma basis, CGG has a restored balance sheet with a net debt brought back to $631m, corresponding to a leverage ratio at 1.7 times.\nThroughout this difficult period, CGG benefited from the continuous support of its clients and the full commitment of its employees and is now ready for a new momentum. With a restored balance sheet, strong technological positions and proven operational excellence, the Group has begun 2018 with renewed confidence and is ready to take full advantage of a rebound in the market.\"\nPost-closing events\nJanuary 15 th : Reduction of the share capital from €17,706,519 to €221,331 by reducing the nominal value of the Company's shares from €0.80 to €0.01 January 22 nd : Launch of the capital increase with preferential subscription rights for an amount of €112 million, by way of an issuance of shares of the Company each with one warrant attached (Warrants #2) January 25 th : Trading halt on the Convertible Bonds 2019, the Convertible Bonds 2020, and the Senior Notes on the Euro MTF market, from the opening of the market on February 1, 2018 February 9 th : Rights issue with preferential subscription right (PSR) of €112 million (including share premium) was fully subscribed February 21 st : Completion of the financial restructuring with settlement-delivery of all securities and instruments.\nThe financial restructuring with settlement-delivery of all securities and instruments will result in a c. $0.75 billion gain in our consolidated statement of operations. In addition, the equity will increase by c. $1.3 billion through the issuance of new shares (coming from the equitization of the unsecured debt, the rights issue and the future exercise of warrants #3, coordination warrants and backstop warrants), to reach a total equity increase of c. $2.05 billion.\nEmergence from Chapter 11 for the fourteen guarantor subsidiaries the very same day\nFourth Quarter 2017 Key Figures\nBefore Non-Recurring Charges (NRC)\nIn million $ Fourth Quarter\n2016 Third Quarter\n2017 Fourth Quarter\n2017 Group Revenue 328.3 320.1 400.7 Group EBITDAs 99.8 89.6 134.1 Group EBITDAs margin 30.4% 28.0% 33.5% Group EBITDAs excluding NOR 104.9 91.1 136.9 Operating Income (70.1) (24.0) 17.5 Opinc margin (21.4)% (7.5)% 4.4% Operating Income excluding NOR (52.4) (19.6) 21.6 Equity from investments (11.1) (11.2) (8.9) Net Financial Costs (55.4) (64.4) (45.8) Income Taxes 29.6 11.6 (12.2) Non-recurring charges (NRC) (172.8) (36.4) (25.5) Net Income (279.8) (124.4) (74.9) Cash Flow from Operations before NRC 129.1 69.2 143.4 Cash Flow from Operations after NRC 95.1 93.8 117.0 Free Cash Flow before NRC 2.0 (10.9) 13.4 Free Cash Flow after NRC (32.0) 13.7 (13.0) Net Debt 2,311.6 2,570.7 2,639.9 Capital Employed 3,468.4 3,190.3 3,168.0 Full-Year 2017 Key Figures\nBefore Non-Recurring Charges (NRC)\nIn million $ FY 2016 FY 2017 Group Revenue 1,195.5 1,320.0 Group EBITDAs 327.9 372.4 Group EBITDAs margin 27.4% 28.2% Group EBITDAs excluding NOR 350.1 386.7 Operating Income (212.7) (77.2) Opinc margin (17.8)% (5.8)% Operating Income excluding NOR (128.4) (43.1) Equity from investments (8.2) (20.1) Net Financial Costs (185.6) (206.8) Income Taxes 13.7 (23.7) Non-recurring charges (NRC) (183.8) (186.3) Net Income (576.6) (514.1) Cash Flow from Operations before NRC 522.4 299.2 Cash Flow from Operations after NRC 355.1 197.9 Free Cash Flow before NRC (6.7) (95.7) Free Cash Flow after NRC (174.0) (197.0) Net Debt 2,311.6 2,639.9 Capital Employed 3,468.4 3,168.0\nGoing concern\nThe consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017 were approved by the Board of Directors on March 8, 2018 on a going concern basis.\nThe main steps of the implementation of the restructuring plan were implemented successfully and the legal proceedings that have been initiated relating to the French safeguard procedure and to the US Chapter 11 procedure are terminated. On February 21, 2018, CGG finalized the implementation of its financial restructuring plan, which meets the Company's objectives of strengthening its balance sheet and providing financial flexibility to continue investing in the future. This plan comprised (i) the equitization of all the unsecured senior debt, (ii) the extension of the maturities of the secured senior debt and (iii) the provision of additional liquidity (c. $305m after partial repayment of the secured senior debt) to meet various business scenarios.\nThe Board of Directors considered that (i) the Group no longer faces material uncertainties that may cast doubt upon its ability to continue as a going concern and that (ii) the Group's liquidity and cash flow are sufficient to meet our expected cash requirements until at least December 31, 2018.\nHaving considered the above, the Board of Directors concluded that preparing the December 31, 2017 consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis is an appropriate assumption.\nFirst time application of IFRS 15\nRevenue recognition for multi-clients original participants contracts (formerly 'pre commitments') has been subject to an in-depth analysis of the industry practice and of the multi-client business model with CGG's auditors. In line with what was disclosed recently by other seismic players, a preliminary analysis, based purely on IFRS 15 form and applied to present contracts letter, is showing that there is a high risk that all the revenues related to multi-clients original participants contracts would have, under the new norm, to be recognized only at delivery of the final processed data, which may be more than one year after acquisition of the data. Subject to certain contractual documentation improvement and clarifications, CGG supports the conclusion that original participants contracts are services contracts for which revenue should be recognized over time based on data acquisition and processing progress of the survey, continuing the accounting for pre commitments under current industry practice prior to the adoption of IFRS 15 in 2018. Such conclusion has been shared and discussed with other seismic players. However, this conclusion has not yet been endorsed by the auditors and the regulators of the financial markets where CGG shares are publicly traded.\nAs a reminder, the revenues related to multi-clients original participants amounted to $269m in 2017.\nFourth quarter 2017 financial results by operating segment and before non-recurring charges\nGeology, Geophysics & Reservoir (GGR)\nGGR\nIn million $ Fourth Quarter\n2016 Third Quarter\n2017 Fourth Quarter\n2017 Variation\nYear-on-year Variation\nQuarter-to-quarter Total Revenue 230.2 185.9 255.0 11% 37% Multi-Client 133.9 105.5 158.6 18% 50% Prefunding 58.3 70.1 72.1 24% 3% After-Sales 75.6 35.4 86.5 14% 144% Subsurface Imaging & Reservoir (SIR) 96.3 80.4 96.4 0% 20% EBITDAs 155.8 102.0 164.5 6% 61% Margin 67.7% 54.9% 64.5% (320) bps 960 bps Operating Income 26.0 11.8 63.3 143% 436% Margin 11.3% 6.3% 24.8% na na Equity from Investments (2.2) (0.2) (0.2) na na Capital Employed (in billion $) 2.3 2.2 2.2 na na GGR Total Revenue was $255 million, up 11% year-on-year and 37% sequentially.\nMulti-Client revenue was $159 million, up 18% year-on-year and 50% sequentially. 75% of the fleet was allocated to multi-client programs compared to 38% in Q4 2016 and 33% in Q3 2017. Multi-client sales were the highest in Brazil and North Sea.\nPrefunding revenue was $72 million, up 24% year-on-year and 3% sequentially. Multi-client cash capex was at $89 million, up 67% year-on-year and 66% sequentially. The cash prefunding rate was at 82% versus 109% in Q4 2016. After-sales were $87 million, up 14% year-on-year and 144% sequentially.\nSubsurface Imaging & Reservoir revenue was $96 million, stable year-on-year and up 20% sequentially.\nGGR EBITDAs was $165 million, a 64.5% margin.\nGGR Operating Income was $63 million, a 24.8% margin. The multi-client depreciation rate totaled 53%, leading to a library Net Book Value of $831 million at the end of December 2017, split 90% offshore and 10% onshore.\nGGR Capital Employed was stable at $2.2 billion at the end of December 2017.\nEquipment\nEquipment\nIn million $ Fourth Quarter\n2016 Third Quarter\n2017 Fourth Quarter\n2017 Variation\nYear-on-year Variation\nQuarter-to-quarter Total Revenue 84.0 39.8 116.0 38% 191% External Revenue 47.8 36.2 105.9 122% 193% Internal Revenue 36.2 3.6 10.1 (72)% 181% EBITDAs 5.3 (8.3) 16.4 209% 298% Margin 6.3% (20.9)% 14.1% 780 bps NA Operating Income (2.9) (15.8) 8.9 407% 156% Margin (3.5)% (39.7)% 7.7% na na Capital Employed (in billion $) 0.6 0.6 0.6 na na Equipment Total Revenue was $116 million, up 38% year-on-year and 191% sequentially. This sharp rise can be explained by staggered deliveries from Q3 to Q4 and the usual seasonal pattern at year-end driving a strong activity pick-up this last quarter.\nExternal sales were $106 million, up 122% year-on-year and 193% sequentially. Internal sales remained limited at $10m in 2017 versus $36m in Q4 2016.\nLand equipment sales represented 64% of total sales, compared to 44% in the fourth quarter of 2016, driven notably by 508 XT deliveries.\nMarine equipment sales represented 36% of total sales, compared to 56% in the fourth quarter of 2016, driven notably by various sentinel sections deliveries.\nEquipment EBITDAs was $16 million, a margin of 14.1%.\nEquipment Operating Income was $9 million, a margin of 7.7%.\nEquipment Capital Employed was stable at $0.6 billion at the end of December 2017.\nContractual Data Acquisition\nContractual Data Acquisition\nIn million $ Fourth Quarter\n2016 Third Quarter\n2017 Fourth Quarter\n2017 Variation\nYear-on-year Variation\nQuarter-to-quarter Total Revenue 51.5 98.7 41.5 (19)% (58)% External Revenue 50.3 98.0 39.8 (21)% (59)% Internal Revenue 1.2 0.7 1.7 42% 143% Total Marine Acquisition 35.0 71.1 9.9 (72)% (86)% Total Land and Multi-Physics Acquisition 16.5 27.6 31.6 92% 14% EBITDAs (33.2) 5.1 (26.3) 21% (616)% Margin (64.5)% 5.2% (63.4)% 110 bps NA Operating Income (51.4) (7.1) (33.0) 36% (365)% Margin (99.8)% (7.2)% (79.5)% na na Equity from Investments (8.9) (8.2) (5.8) 35% 29% Capital Employed (in billion $) 0.4 0.4 0.3 na na Contractual Data Acquisition Total Revenue was $42 million, down 19% year-on-year and 58% sequentially.\nContractual Marine Data Acquisition revenue was $10 million, down 72% year-on-year and 86% sequentially\nOur vessel availability rate was 82% due to weather standby. This compares to 90% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 99% in the third quarter of 2017. Our vessel production rate was 97%. This compares to 97% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 96% in the third quarter of 2017.\nThe decrease in revenue can mainly be explained by the higher dedication to multi-client surveys, as 75% of the fleet was dedicated to multi-client programs versus 38% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and 33% in the third quarter of 2017.\nLand and Multi-Physics Data Acquisition revenue was $32million, up 92% year-on-year and 14% sequentially. Land and Airborne continued to increase slightly this quarter, in line with the trend seen in Q3.\nContractual Data Acquisition EBITDAs was $(26) million.\nContractual Data Acquisition Operating Income was $(33) million. Contractual Data Acquisition activities continued to suffer from a competitive market and were further impacted by delays and weather conditions this quarter.\nThe equity from investments can mainly be explained by the negative contribution from the PTSC JV in Vietnam this quarter.\nContractual Data Acquisition Capital Employed was down at $0.3 billion at the end of December 2017.\nNon-Operated Resources\nNon-Operated Resources\nIn million $ Fourth Quarter\n2016 Third Quarter\n2017 Fourth Quarter\n2017 Variation\nYear-on-year Variation\nQuarter-to-quarter EBITDAs (5.1) (1.5) (2.8) 45% (87)% Operating Income (17.7) (4.4) (4.1) 77% 7% Equity from Investments 0 (2.8) (2.9) na (4)% Capital Employed (in billion $) 0.2 0 0.1 na na The Non-Operated Resources Segment comprises, in terms of EBITDAs and Operating Income, the costs relating to non-operated resources.\nNon-Operated Resources EBITDAs was $(3) million.\nNon-Operated Resources Operating Income was $(4) million. The amortization of excess streamers, mainly, has a negative impact on the contribution of this segment.\nThe equity from investments includes the impact of 50% of the Global Seismic Shipping (GSS) JV, which we own with Eidesvik.

Multi-Client sales reached $469 million, up 22%, with a cash prefunding rate of 107%. Our highest marine multi-client sales were made in Brazil, the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. The depreciation rate was 63% leading to a Net Book Value of $831 million at the end of December.\nSubsurface Imaging delivered a resilient performance: we maintained our market share. While reservoir businesses were impacted by clients' capex cut.\nEquipment operating income margin was at (14.9)%. Despite very efficient cost management and manufacturing flexibility, profitability was impacted by very low volumes. Contractual Data Acquisition operating income margin was at (31.7)% due to weak pricing conditions in Marine, despite our fleet's good operational performance with a high production rate at 97%. 52% of our fleet was dedicated to the contractual market as we executed two large contracts with high-end multi-source vessel setup. Positive impact of lower marine cost base in 2017 was partly offset by the non-recurrent R&D tax credit received in 2016.
