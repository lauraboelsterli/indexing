    "text": "Adds 27% more high-grade production to its strong North American silver and gold mines\nCOEUR D’ALENE, Idaho & VANCOUVER, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hecla Mining Company ( NYSE:HL ) (Hecla) and Klondex Mines Ltd. (NYSE American:KLDX; TSX:KDX) (Klondex) today announced Hecla will acquire all the outstanding shares of Klondex, a high-grade Nevada underground gold producer with its Fire Creek, Midas and Hollister mines, through a plan of arrangement (the Transaction). Klondex's Canadian assets will be spun out to its existing shareholders.\nUnder the Transaction, Hecla will acquire Klondex for consideration of US$462 million with a mix of cash and shares of Hecla common stock and the newly formed company (Klondex Canada). Klondex’s shareholders will receive US$2.47 per share in cash or shares of Hecla, which represents a 59% premium to Klondex’s 30-day volume-weighted average price, as at March 16, 2018, on the NYSE American.\n“ Opportunities to acquire significant land packages along Nevada’s prolific gold trends are very rare. Rarer still are for these land packages to have the highest grade mines in the U.S. and this transaction is consistent with Hecla’s strategy of owning large prospective land packages with mines where we can improve costs, grow reserves and expand production,” said Phillips S. Baker, Jr., Hecla’s President and CEO. “We structured the deal to use our excess cash balances so our shareholders can benefit from the approximately 162,000 gold equivalent ounces a year of production while minimizing dilution.”\nMr. Baker continued, “One of our core strengths is operating high-grade, narrow-vein underground mines, and Klondex’s three operating mines – Fire Creek, Midas and Hollister – are some of the highest-grade gold mines in the world. After extensive due diligence, we see significant opportunity to improve costs, throughput and recoveries over time with our expertise. The combined approximately 110 square mile land position offers the opportunity to make discoveries and grow the reserve base as we improve our knowledge of the geology, something we have done at our other operations. We expect this transaction to be accretive on many important financial and credit metrics, with potentially significant synergies. We are pleased that two significant Klondex shareholders have committed to support this transaction, and look forward to welcoming other Klondex shareholders to our company.”\n“This transaction is an excellent outcome for Klondex and our shareholders, delivering premium value and a clear pathway to develop and optimize the Nevada mining assets and create further value in the future,” said Paul Huet, Klondex’s President and CEO. “Hecla has a proven track record of developing and optimizing mining assets such as ours, and has a strong balance sheet that should help Fire Creek and our other properties reach their full potential. Hecla operates a diverse portfolio of some of the highest-grade mines in the world, and the addition of our assets strengthens the portfolio further. We are delighted to enter into this agreement and the Klondex board unanimously recommends that Klondex shareholders vote in favour of this transaction.”\nA Further Transformation of Hecla\nSeven large land positions located in Alaska, Quebec, Nevada, Mexico and Idaho – Some of the safest and most prolific mining jurisdictions in the world. Proven operational excellence to be leveraged across expanded portfolio of high-grade mines – Hecla has an extensive track record of optimizing acquired assets as demonstrated at Casa Berardi and Greens Creek. Hecla’s expertise in narrow-vein mining and mill optimization will be applied to the acquisitions to improve the operational consistency and enhance the value of the expanded portfolio. Well capitalized pro-forma company with strong cash flow and solid balance sheet – Hecla expects to improve financial metrics with the Nevada mines’ cash flow. Significant production base with highly prospective growth opportunities and cost reductions – Adds about 162,000 oz of annual gold equivalent production. Hecla will launch a significant exploration program at Fire Creek and at the prospective Hatter Graben discovery at Hollister. Increased precious metals production – Peer group leading pro-forma production profile amongst intermediate precious metal producers of 762koz AuEq (2017A) or 54.1moz AgEq and commodity distribution of 30% Ag, 50% Au, 15% Zn and 5% Pb (by revenue).\nBenefits to Hecla Shareholders\nAdds significant land position with extensive exploration and development potential, and production in Nevada, one of the most prolific gold mining jurisdictions in the world. Increases pro-forma 2017 annual production by 27%, equating to 162koz on a gold equivalent basis or 11.5 million ounces on a silver equivalent basis. Fire Creek is a cornerstone producing asset with robust cash flows and significant opportunities for exploration, mine life expansion, and increased throughput. The Transaction is structured to minimize dilution and is expected to be accretive on most important financial and operating metrics. Allows Hecla the opportunity to capture meaningful synergies. Further increases the grade of one of the highest-grade asset portfolios in the industry. Klondex’s assets leverage Hecla’s core competency in narrow-vein underground mining.\nBenefits to Klondex Shareholders\nImmediate and significant premium of approximately 59% based on the 30-day volume weighted average price and approximately 72% based on closing prices on March 16, 2018, with ongoing participation in upside through Hecla shares and through Klondex Canada shares. Superior financial strength and flexibility to support critical development and exploration programs for Klondex’s assets. Hecla is well capitalized, with a lower cost of capital, making possible critical development and exploration programs for Klondex’s assets. Proven track record of successfully acquiring and optimizing underground assets. Superior investment with enhanced liquidity and a far more diversified production and financial base. Hecla has extensive experience operating efficient underground mines for over 125 years. Ownership in Klondex Canada, a gold company created to leverage Klondex’s exploration expertise and significant mining infrastructure assets in Canada.\nKlondex Canada\nKlondex is pleased to be forming Klondex Canada. Certain members of Klondex’s board and management team will continue on at Klondex Canada. Hecla will subscribe for US$7.0 million of common shares of New Klondex in exchange for a 13.46% equity interest, based on a pre-investment Klondex Canada valuation of US$45 million . Klondex Canada intends to make an application to list its shares on the TSX-V.\nTerms of the Transaction\nKlondex shareholders may elect to receive either US$2.47 in cash (Cash Alternative) or 0.6272 of a Hecla share (Share Alternative), each full Hecla share being currently valued at US$3.94, subject in each case to pro-ration based on a maximum cash consideration of US$157.4 million and a maximum number of Hecla shares issued of 77.4 million. If all Klondex shareholders elect either the Cash Alternative or the Share Alternative, each Klondex shareholder would be entitled to receive US$0.8411 in cash and 0.4136 Hecla shares. Klondex shareholders may also elect to receive US$0.8411 in cash and 0.4136 of a Hecla share and Klondex shareholders who fail to make an election will automatically receive US$0.8411 in cash and 0.4136 of a Hecla share. Klondex shareholders will also receive shares of a newly formed company (Klondex Canada) which will hold Klondex’s Canadian assets, including the True North and Bison Gold Resources properties.\nAt closing existing Hecla and Klondex shareholders will own approximately 83.8% and 16.2% of Hecla’s outstanding common stock, respectively.\nMajor Shareholder Support\nCI Investments Inc. and Sentry Investments Inc., which together hold approximately 42.5 million shares of Klondex, representing approximately 23.7% of Klondex’s issued and outstanding shares, have entered into support agreements with Hecla, agreeing to vote their Klondex shares in favour of the Transaction. Each of Klondex’s directors and officers have also entered into an agreement to support the Transaction and the Board of Directors of Klondex has unanimously recommended that Klondex’s affected securityholders vote in favour of the transaction.\nBoard of Directors’ Recommendations\nThe Transaction has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of each of Klondex and Hecla.

The Arrangement Agreement provides for customary deal-protection provisions, including a non-solicitation covenant on the part of Klondex and a right for Hecla to match any superior proposal. The Arrangement Agreement includes a termination fee of US$21 million, payable by Klondex or Hecla, under certain circumstances.\nIt is anticipated that the special meeting of Klondex shareholders to consider the Transaction will be held in June 2018. The Transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.\nNo Financing Contingency\nHecla has sufficient cash on hand and available under existing credit arrangements to finance the cash portion of the consideration for the Transaction.\nSection 3(a)(10) of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), exempts from the registration requirements of the Securities Act the issuance and exchange of securities which have been approved, after a hearing upon the fairness of the terms and conditions on which all persons to whom it is proposed the securities will be issued shall have the right to appear, by any Court expressly authorized by law to grant such approval.
