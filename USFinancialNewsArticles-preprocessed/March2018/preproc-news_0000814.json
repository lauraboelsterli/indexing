    "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Li Shufu, the founder and main owner of China’s Geely [GEELY.UL], is not seeking influence over Daimler’s ( DAIGn.DE ) strategy via representation on its board after building up a stake of almost 10 percent in the German carmaker, according to a newspaper interview.\n“I respect the values and culture of Daimler. I have never asked for a seat on the supervisory board, and that doesn’t have any priority for me,” German weekly Bild am Sonntag Quote: d Li as saying in an interview.\nGeely’s purchase of a $9 billion stake in the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars has rekindled fears in Germany of its highly-prized expertise falling into Chinese hands.\nReporting by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Arno Schuetze\n ",
