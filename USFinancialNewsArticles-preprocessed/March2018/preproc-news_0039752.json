In this partnership, Better4U pays for the product up front which eliminates the credit risks for Pulse. At Pulse’s current revenue run rate, this provides a 40% improvement in annual sales which is in addition to the gains in sales estimated for Natural Cabana® Coconut Waters that was announced earlier this month.\nRobert E. Yates, CEO of Pulse, said, “We are pleased to be able to offer our products in Taiwan where our partners are currently building retail storefronts that will offer our products for sale. Our partners have comprehensive consumer goods distribution relationships in the Republic of China and we are pleased to have be introduced to a population base of over 23.6 million new consumers that will have an opportunity to taste our Natural Cabana® Lemonades & Limeades.”\n“Pictures contained in this press release show two of the storefronts (under construction) that will offer our products for sale.”\nhttp://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/572f0940-2ffb-4def-a359-8c2f15f0b591\nMr. Yates continued, “This arrangement makes a lot of sense for Pulse. We have no distribution costs or credit risks in this business model. We collect from the customers in Taiwan, reimburse Better4U for their cash outlays and record the entire transaction in Pulse’s books. Our partner is responsible for paying for the manufacturing up front as well as transit costs.”\nAbout Pulse Beverage Corporation:\nPulse Beverage Corporation (\"Pulse\") is an emerging beverage company that offers Natural Cabana® Lemonade/Limeade in 7 great tasting, low-calorie flavors and Natural Cabana® Coconut Water in pineapple and natural flavors.
