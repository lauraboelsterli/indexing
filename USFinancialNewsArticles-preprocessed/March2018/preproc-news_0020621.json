    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Continental ( CONG.DE ) said its financial resources for acquisitions have increased on the back of growing earnings but it has no near-term plans for a large takeover deal.\nLogo of German tyre company Continental is seen before the annual news conference in Hanover, Germany March 2, 2017. REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer “You should not expect me to give information soon about a big acquisition,” finance chief Wolfgang Schaefer said in an interview on Thursday.\n“But of course the means we have at hand and the possibilities in general after a good year have grown a bit again,” he said, after the company reported a 3.5 percent gain in fourth-quarter adjusted earnings.\nSeparately, Schaefer said the auto parts and tyre maker would take a hit from possible U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports as car prices in the U.S. would rise.\nReporting by Andreas Cremer and Jan Schwartz; Editing by Douglas Busvine\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
