    "text": "1 COMMENTS Ryder System Inc. R 0.09% is launching a commercial vehicle-sharing marketplace, a sort of Airbnb for transportation assets, that lets companies rent out their extra vehicles and users more affordably expand capacity.\nRyder, which provides fleet-management and supply-chain services, said Tuesday that about 25% of U.S. commercial vehicles regularly sit idle for more than a day a week, excluding weekends. The service, dubbed COOP, lets leaseholders and owners make money from their sitting vehicles while providing users to get vehicles for short-term use on more flexible terms than typically available. \nThe service launched in an early stage in January in the Atlanta metro area and Ryder said it plans to fully expand in the region next month and into several other major markets next year.\nCOOP is currently a mobile-optimized website and Ryder said it expects to roll out a COOP mobile app in the fourth quarter.\nOver the last decade, “sharing-economy” companies, such as room- and house-rental business Airbnb Inc. and ride-hailing business Uber Technologies Inc., have disrupted many consumer-focused fields. \nAlso in Logistics \nUber Freight Rolls Out Incentives to Lure Scarce Truck Drivers March 22, 2018 Trucking Acquisitions Put New Spotlight on Fleet Values March 20, 2018 KeepTruckin Raises $50 Million to Back Truck Technology Expansion March 20, 2018 Shared-capacity services have been slower to roll out in industrial shipping markets, although several startups are pushing into the freight brokerage business with apps that link customers with shipments to empty trucks. Seattle-based Flexe and Los Angeles-based Flowspace are using an Airbnb-style service to offer spare warehouse space to customers that may not want to lease distribution centers for long terms. \nRyder’s new marketplace “makes trucks shareable at a time when the sharing economy is driving innovation in many industries,” Ryder Chief Executive Robert Sanchez said. “Seasonal and cyclical truck shortages, coupled with fleets’ excess and unused capacity, demonstrates the benefit of having a technology like COOP available in the marketplace.”\nThe platform will be open to Ryder and non-Ryder customers and could have vehicles that Ryder itself doesn’t supply in its main business, as long as they meet safety and reliability standards.\nIf successful, the marketplace could allow independent contractors to venture into businesses previously confined to larger companies that could afford specialized vehicles, said Don Ake, vice president of commercial vehicles at freight transport research group FTR. \nRyder will have to balance serving customers of its new rental marketplace while not driving down prices in its actively managed fleet business.\nRyder probably asked itself “are we hurting ourselves by doing this?,” Mr. Ake said. “Ryder probably looked at that and said, ‘This is going to happen anyhow. Who’s going to be the leader here?’ And so I think they are willing to take that risk.”\nWrite to Austen Hufford at austen.hufford@wsj.com",
