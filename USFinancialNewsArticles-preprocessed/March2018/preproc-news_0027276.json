    "text": "SANTA MONICA, Calif., March 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Entravision Communications Corporation (NYSE: EVC) today reported financial results for the three- and twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017.\nHistorical results, which are attached, are in thousands of U.S. dollars (except share and per share data). This press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC Regulation G. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to each of these non-GAAP financial measures, and a table reconciling each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included beginning on page 11. Unaudited financial highlights are as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n% Change\n2017\n2016\n% Change\nNet revenue:\nRevenue from advertising and\nretransmission consent\n$\n73,460\n$\n70,291\n5\n%\n$\n272,091\n$\n258,514\n5\n%\nRevenue from spectrum usage rights\n-\n-\n*\n263,943\n-\n*\n$\n73,460\n$\n70,291\n5\n%\n$\n536,034\n$\n258,514\n107\n%\nCost of revenue - television (spectrum\nusage rights) (1)\n209\n-\n*\n12,340\n-\n*\nCost of revenue - digital media (1)\n11,782\n3,043\n287\n%\n32,206\n9,536\n238\n%\nOperating expenses (2)\n45,118\n41,102\n10\n%\n168,399\n160,237\n5\n%\nCorporate expenses (3)\n8,242\n7,918\n4\n%\n27,937\n24,543\n14\n%\nForeign currency (gain) loss\n57\n-\n*\n350\n-\n*\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA (4)\n11,199\n20,620\n(46)\n%\n51,400\n69,243\n(26)\n%\nFree cash flow (5)\n$\n5,901\n$\n14,919\n(60)\n%\n$\n287,618\n$\n45,204\n536\n%\nNet income\n$\n12,972\n$\n7,003\n85\n%\n$\n176,293\n$\n20,405\n764\n%\nNet income per share, basic\n$\n0.14\n$\n0.08\n75\n%\n$\n1.95\n$\n0.23\n748\n%\nNet income per share, diluted\n$\n0.14\n$\n0.08\n75\n%\n$\n1.92\n$\n0.22\n773\n%\nWeighted average common shares\noutstanding, basic\n89,980,200\n89,733,294\n90,272,257\n89,340,589\nWeighted average common shares outstanding, diluted\n91,613,199\n91,642,487\n91,891,957\n91,303,056\n(1) Cost of revenue – digital media consists primarily of the costs of online media acquired from third-party publishers. Media cost is classified as cost of revenue in the period in which the corresponding revenue is recognized. Cost of revenue – television (spectrum usage rights) consists primarily of the carrying value of spectrum usage rights surrendered in the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\") auction for broadcast spectrum.\n(2) Operating expenses include direct operating and selling, general and administrative expenses. Included in operating expenses are $0.4 million and $0.6 million of non-cash stock-based compensation for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $1.2 million and $1.3 million of non-cash stock-based compensation for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Operating expenses do not include corporate expenses, foreign currency (gain) loss, depreciation and amortization, impairment charge, gain (loss) on sale of assets, gain (loss) on debt extinguishment and other income (loss).\n(3) Corporate expenses include $2.5 million and $1.8 million of non-cash stock-based compensation for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $4.9 million and $3.7 million of non-cash stock-based compensation for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n(4) Consolidated adjusted EBITDA means net income (loss) plus gain (loss) on sale of assets, depreciation and amortization, non-cash impairment charge, non-cash stock-based compensation included in operating and corporate expenses, net interest expense, other income (loss), gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, income tax (expense) benefit, equity in net income (loss) of nonconsolidated affiliate, non-cash losses, syndication programming amortization less syndication programming payments, revenue from FCC spectrum incentive auction less related expenses, expenses associated with investments, acquisitions and dispositions and certain pro-forma cost savings. We use the term consolidated adjusted EBITDA because that measure is defined in the agreement governing our current credit facility (\"the 2017 Credit Facility\") and does not include gain (loss) on sale of assets, depreciation and amortization, non-cash impairment charge, non-cash stock-based compensation, net interest expense, other income (loss), gain (loss) on debt extinguishment, income tax (expense) benefit, equity in net income (loss) of nonconsolidated affiliate, non-cash losses, syndication programming amortization and does include syndication programming payments, revenue from FCC spectrum incentive auction less related expenses, expenses associated with investments, acquisitions and dispositions and certain pro-forma cost savings.\n(5) Free cash flow is defined as consolidated adjusted EBITDA less cash paid for income taxes, net interest expense, and capital expenditures plus revenue from FCC spectrum incentive auction less related cash expenses. Net interest expense is defined as interest expense, less non-cash interest expense relating to amortization of debt finance costs, and less interest income.\nCommenting on the Company's earnings results, Walter F. Ulloa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"During the fourth quarter, we achieved revenue growth driven by increases in our digital media segment attributable to the acquisition of Headway. This growth in our digital media segment offsets decreases in both our television and radio segments, which were affected by decreases in local and national advertising revenue and the loss of political advertising revenue compared to 2016. We continued to build our digital footprint and, looking ahead, we remain well positioned to build on our success in further attracting Latino and other audiences worldwide, and expanding our advertiser base to the benefit of our shareholders.\"\nFinancial Results\nThree-Month Period Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Three-Month Period Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n% Change\nNet, revenue from advertising and retransmission consent\n$\n73,460\n$\n70,291\n5\n%\nCost of revenue - television (spectrum usage rights) (1)\n209\n-\n*\nCost of revenue - digital media (1)\n11,782\n3,043\n287\n%\nOperating expenses (1)\n45,118\n41,102\n10\n%\nCorporate expenses (1)\n8,242\n7,918\n4\n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n3,951\n3,618\n9\n%\nForeign currency (gain) loss\n57\n-\n*\nOperating income\n4,101\n14,610\n(72)\n%\nInterest expense, net\n(5,326)\n(3,746)\n42\n%\nOther income (loss)\n262\n-\n*\nGain (loss) on debt extinguishment\n(3,306)\n(161)\n1953\n%\nIncome before income taxes\n(4,269)\n10,703\n*\nIncome tax (expense) benefit\n17,376\n(3,700)\n*\nNet income (loss) before equity in net income (loss) of nonconsolidated\naffiliates\n13,107\n7,003\n87\n%\nEquity in net income (loss) of nonconsolidated affiliates\n(135)\n-\n*\nNet income\n$\n12,972\n$\n7,003\n85\n%\n(1) Cost of revenue, operating expenses and corporate expenses are defined on page 1.\nNet revenue from advertising and retransmission consent increased to $73.5 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 from $70.3 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $3.2 million. Of the overall increase, $13.6 million was attributable to our digital media segment and was primarily due to the acquisition of 100% of the stock of several entities collectively doing business as Headway (\"Headway\") during the second quarter of 2017, which did not contribute to net revenue in prior periods. The overall increase was partially offset by a decrease in our television segment of $7.3 million due primarily to a decrease in both local and national revenue and a decrease in political advertising revenue, which was not material in 2017, partially offset by an increase in retransmission consent revenue. Additionally, the overall increase was partially offset by a decrease in our radio segment of $3.1 million due primarily to decreases in both local and national advertising revenue, and a decrease in political advertising revenue, which was not material in 2017.\nCost of revenue related to revenue from spectrum usage rights was $0.2 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017. We did not incur cost of revenue from spectrum usage rights in 2016.\nCost of revenue in our digital media segment increased to $11.8 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 from $3.0 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $8.8 million, primarily due to the acquisition of Headway during the second quarter of 2017, which did not contribute to cost of revenue in prior periods.\nOperating expenses increased to $45.1 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 from $41.1 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $4.0 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Headway during the second quarter of 2017, which did not contribute to operating expenses in prior periods, an increase in salary expense and an increase in bad debt expense. The overall increase was partially offset by a decrease in expenses associated with the decrease in television and radio advertising revenue and a decrease in expenses for ratings services and promotional events.\nCorporate expenses increased to $8.2 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 from $7.9 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $0.3 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense.\nIncome tax expense for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 includes a one-time provisional tax benefit of $17.3 million. This net tax benefit primarily consists of the net tax impact to our deferred taxes from the corporate rate reduction as a result of the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nTwelve-month Period Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Twelve-month Period Ended\nDecember 31, 2016\n(Unaudited)\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n% Change\nNet revenue:\nRevenue from advertising and retransmission consent\n$\n272,091\n$\n258,514\n5\n%\nRevenue from spectrum usage rights\n263,943\n-\n*\nTotal net revenue\n536,034\n258,514\n107\n%\nCost of revenue - television (spectrum usage rights) (1)\n12,340\n-\n*\nCost of revenue - digital media (1)\n32,206\n9,536\n238\n%\nOperating expenses (1)\n168,399\n160,237\n5\n%\nCorporate expenses (1)\n27,937\n24,543\n14\n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n16,411\n15,342\n7\n%\nForeign currency (gain) loss\n350\n-\n*\nOperating income\n278,391\n48,856\n470\n%\nInterest expense, net\n(15,935)\n(15,169)\n5\n%\nOther income (loss)\n262\n-\n*\nGain (loss) on debt extinguishment\n(3,306)\n(161)\n1953\n%\nIncome before income taxes\n259,412\n33,526\n674\n%\nIncome tax (expense) benefit\n(82,809)\n(13,121)\n531\n%\nNet income (loss) before equity in net income (loss) of nonconsolidated\naffiliates\n176,603\n20,405\n765\n%\nEquity in net income (loss) of nonconsolidated affiliates\n(310)\n-\n*\nNet income\n$\n176,293\n$\n20,405\n764\n%\n(1) Cost of revenue, operating expenses and corporate expenses are defined on page 1.\nNet revenue from advertising and retransmission consent increased to $272.1 million for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017 from $258.5 million for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $13.6 million. Of the overall increase, $34.0 million was attributable to our digital media segment and was primarily due to the acquisition of Headway during the second quarter of 2017, which did not contribute to net revenue in prior periods. The overall increase was partially offset by a decrease in our television segment of $11.5 million due to a decrease in local revenue and a decrease in political advertising revenue, which was not material in 2017, partially offset by an increase in national advertising revenue and an increase in retransmission consent revenue. Additionally, the overall increase was partially offset by a decrease in our radio segment of $8.9 million due to decreases in both local and national advertising revenue, and a decrease in political advertising revenue, which was not material in 2017.\nNet revenue from spectrum usage rights was $263.9 million for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017.

The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Headway during the second quarter of 2017, which did not contribute to operating expenses in prior periods. The overall increase was partially offset by decreases in expenses associated with the decrease in television and radio advertising revenue and decreases in rent expense, ratings service expense and event expense.\nCorporate expenses increased to $27.9 million for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017 from $24.5 million for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $3.4 million. The increase was primarily due to expenses associated with the FCC auction for broadcast spectrum and non-cash stock-based compensation expense.\nIncome tax expense for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017 includes a one-time provisional tax benefit of $17.3 million. This net tax benefit primarily consists of the net tax impact to our deferred taxes from the corporate rate reduction as a result of the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nSegment Results\nThe following represents selected unaudited segment information:\nThree Months Ended\nTwelve Months Ended\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\n% Change\n2017\n2016\n% Change\nNet Revenue\nRevenue from advertising and retransmission\nconsent\nTelevision\n$\n36,038\n$\n43,380\n(17)\n%\n$\n148,059\n$\n159,523\n(7)\n%\nRadio\n17,118\n20,242\n(15)\n%\n66,934\n75,847\n(12)\n%\nDigital\n20,304\n6,669\n204\n%\n57,098\n23,144\n147\n%\nTotal\n$\n73,460\n$\n70,291\n5\n%\n$\n272,091\n$\n258,514\n5\n%\nRevenue from spectrum usage rights (television)\n$\n-\n$\n-\n*\n$\n263,943\n$\n-\n*\nTotal Net Revenue\n$\n73,460\n$\n70,291\n5\n%\n$\n536,034\n$\n258,514\n107\n%\nCost of Revenue (1)\nTelevision\n209\n-\n*\n12,340\n-\n*\nDigital\n11,782\n3,043\n287\n%\n32,206\n9,536\n238\n%\nTotal\n$\n11,991\n$\n3,043\n294\n%\n$\n44,546\n$\n9,536\n367\n%\nOperating Expenses (1)\nTelevision\n21,214\n21,312\n(0)\n%\n81,730\n83,611\n(2)\n%\nRadio\n16,021\n16,904\n(5)\n%\n63,315\n65,390\n(3)\n%\nDigital\n7,883\n2,886\n173\n%\n23,354\n11,236\n108\n%\nTotal\n$\n45,118\n$\n41,102\n10\n%\n$\n168,399\n$\n160,237\n5\n%\nCorporate Expenses (1)\n$\n8,242\n$\n7,918\n4\n%\n$\n27,937\n$\n24,543\n14\n%\nForeign currency (gain) loss\n$\n57\n$\n-\n*\n$\n350\n$\n-\n*\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA (1)\n$\n11,199\n$\n20,620\n(46)\n%\n$\n51,400\n$\n69,243\n(26)\n%\n(1) Cost of revenue, operating expenses, corporate expenses, and consolidated adjusted EBITDA are defined on page 1.\nEntravision Communications Corporation will hold a conference call to discuss its 2017 fourth quarter and full year results on March 14, 2018 at 5 p.m. Eastern Time.
