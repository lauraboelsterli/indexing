Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi walks with officers as he arrives in Mosul, Iraq, March 14, 2018. Iraqi Prime Minister Media Office/Handout via REUTERS International flights to and from the semi-autonomous region’s two main airports in Erbil and Suleimaniya were halted on Sept. 29 as part of sanctions imposed on the Kurds after they held an independence referendum four days earlier in defiance of Baghdad and voted overwhelmingly for separation. Kurdish authorities have agreed that the airports should come under federal control and report to Baghdad’s interior ministry, the prime minister’s statement said.
