    "text": "Peru's President Kuczynski tenders resignation, promises constitutional transition Published 38 Mins Ago Reuters Mariana Bazo | Reuters Peru's President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski leaves Government Palace after giving his resignation to Congress in Lima, Peru March 21, 2018. \nPeru's President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski announced he had submitted his resignation to Congress on Wednesday after vote-buying allegations ensnared his center-right government on the eve of an impeachment vote \nThe 79-year-old former Wall Street banker promised an orderly and constitutional transition to power and denied the opposition's allegations that he was corrupt. \nIt was unclear whether the opposition-controlled Congress would accept his resignation or move forward with its plan to vote on immediately forcing him from office on Thursday on grounds he is \"morally unfit\" to govern. \nKuczynski was scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at a regional summit in Peru next month.
