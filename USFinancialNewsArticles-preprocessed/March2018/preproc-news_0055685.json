Kim Min-Hee/Pool via REUTERS \nYang, a top Chinese diplomat and a member of China’s elite Politburo, told Moon on a visit to Seoul it was a crucial moment for alleviating the situation on the Korean peninsula, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said. \n“All sides must seize the moment, work together, promote smooth meetings that achieve positive outcomes between leaders of South and North Korea, and between North Korea and the United States, and in due course reopen a substantive political resolution process to the peninsula issue,” Yang said.

Kim Min-Hee/Pool via REUTERS \nYang also informed Moon about Kim’s visit to Beijing this week, the North Korean leader’s first known foreign trip since he assumed power in 2011, where he met Chinese President Xi Jinping. \nMoon thanked Yang for China’s contribution to the easing of tension on the peninsula, the Chinese ministry said in a statement. \nKim is scheduled to meet U.S. President Donald Trump in May to discuss the nuclear issue, although a time and place have not been set. \nHis pledge to denuclearise the Korean peninsula was reported by Chinese state media, but North Korea’s official media made no mention of it, or Kim’s anticipated meeting with Trump. \nKim and Trump had earlier exchanged insults and veiled threats of war but the U.S. leader made the surprising announcement this month that he was prepared to meet Kim. \nTrump wrote on Twitter he had received a message from Xi late on Tuesday that his meeting with Kim “went very well” and that Kim looked forward to meeting the U.S. president.
