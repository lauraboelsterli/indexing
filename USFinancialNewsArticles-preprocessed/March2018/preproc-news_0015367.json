    "text": "Boston,March 08, 2018(GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nGordon Brothers, the global advisory, restructuring, and investment firm, announced enhancements to its business development team within its valuation group across North America. These new appointments strengthen the group’s business development footprint across the Northern, Midwestern and Western regions of the U.S. as well as Canada, complementing its presence in the Northeastern, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeastern U.S.\n“We’re excited to announce these new additions to our business development team to provide the broadest coverage of any appraisal firm in North America,” stated Frank Grimaldi, Senior Managing Director of North American Sales for Gordon Brothers’ valuation practice.\n“All of our new additions are prior commercial & industrial appraisers. They will bring practitioners’ knowledge of the appraisal process and values directly to our clients,” stated Ken Frieze, CEO of Gordon Brothers. “It’s exciting to see talent developed and promoted internally,” he added.\nBased in Chicago, Ryan Ray’s client base has expanded to include all of Illinois, Ohio, and Western Pennsylvania. Ray has been active as an appraiser and business development officer in the Midwest region for over 15 years. He holds his Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) certification.\nBased in Toronto, Mosana Khan will provide business development support for clients across all of Canada. Khan is a native Canadian and has experience as an industrial inventory appraisal analyst with Gordon Brothers. He holds a master’s degree in economics from the University of Waterloo.\nBased in Milwaukee, Eliot Kaufmann will be responsible for the Northern region as well as some portions of the Midwest (North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, Michigan, Indiana, and West Virginia). Kaufmann served as a senior appraiser of machinery and equipment and holds his Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) and American Society of Appraisers (ASA): Introduction to Machinery and Equipment Valuation certifications.\nBased in Los Angeles, Jordan Henrich was appointed in October 2017 to provide business development coverage for Gordon Brothers in the West (California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Idaho, Utah, Montana, Wyoming, Alaska, and Hawaii). He previously worked as a senior consumer products and industrial appraisal analyst and holds his Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) certification.\nBased in Austin, Aaron Walton has been promoted to managing director in recognition of his continued success in client service. Walton has added Arizona to his client base and will continue to cover his existing Southwestern territory (Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana).\nMichael D. Sullivan will continue to serve the Mid-Atlantic, Fran Garvin will continue to serve the Northeast and Conrad Lauten will continue to serve the Southeast. They work alongside seasoned business development leadership, Frank Grimaldi and Rick Ferron, who both work across the U.S. and Canada.\nGordon Brothers also maintains valuation practices across Europe, Asia, Australia and South America. It became the largest appraisal firm serving the asset-based lending industry in the world following its 2015 acquisition of AccuVal.\nAbout Gordon Brothers\nSince 1903, Gordon Brothers ( www.gordonbrothers.com ) has helped lenders, operating executives, advisors, and investors move forward through change. The firm brings a powerful combination of expertise and capital to clients, developing customized solutions on an integrated or standalone basis across four service areas: valuations, dispositions, operations, and investments.
