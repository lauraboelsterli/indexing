We believe our operational plans for 2018 will enable us to capitalize on trends in consumer preferences and the rapidly changing beverage industry.\"\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue\nRevenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $36.2 million, compared to $22.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 59%. This increase was driven primarily by a 72% increase in domestic revenues derived from blended growth rates of 49% in retail accounts, 143% in health and fitness accounts and 84% growth in internet retailer accounts, as well as 37% growth in international revenues, from 2016. International revenue growth was primarily the result of increased sales volume through Func Foods, our Nordic distribution, partner as well as initial revenues generated from the launch of distribution of our products into the Asian market.\nGross Profit\nGross profit was $15.4 million, or 42.7% of revenue, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $9.7 million, or 42.7% of revenue, in 2016. The increase in gross profit from 2016 to 2017 is primarily attributable to the increases in revenue.\nTotal Operating Expense\nSales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $16.6 million compared to $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was due primarily to increases in investment in sales and marketing programs of $6.7 million, with a focus on expansion and the launch of products into China and Hong Kong, increases in warehouse costs of $375,000 and increases in human resource investments of $756,000. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $6.9 million compared to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to increases in stock based compensation expenses of $1.2 million, investments in human resources costs of $869,000, issuance of restricted stock for prior services to two board members of $328,000 and increases in other general and administration expenses.\nTotal Other Expense\nTotal other expense decreased to $161,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, down from $223,000 in 2016 as a result of $68,000 in savings in interest expense, which was partially offset by a gain from the sale of equipment of $6,000 in 2016.\nNet Loss\nAs a result of the all above, for the year ended December 31, 2017, Celsius had a net loss of $8.2 million, and after giving effect to preferred stock dividends of $366,000, a net loss to common stockholders of $8.6 million or ($0.19) per basic and diluted share based on a weighted average of 44,419,162 shares outstanding. In comparison, for the year ended December 31, 2016 the Company had a net loss of $3.1 million, and after giving effect to preferred stock dividends of $366,000, a net loss to common stockholders of $3.4 million or ($0.09) per basic and diluted share based on a weighted average of 38,568,088 shares outstanding.\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2016\nRevenue\nRevenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $9.1 million compared to $6.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 46%. This increase was driven primarily by a 92% increase in domestic revenue associated with blended growth rates of 73% in retail accounts mainly from growth in existing accounts, 151% growth in health and fitness accounts and 80% growth in internet retailer accounts from the same period in 2016, which was partially offset by a 12% decrease in international revenue. The decrease in international revenue was mainly as a result of order timing impacted by new can design launch by Func Foods, our Nordic distribution partner, which was partially offset by revenues from the Company's Asian distribution partners. The net increase in total revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in sales volume, as opposed to increases in product pricing.\nGross profit\nGross profit was $3.8 million, or 41.6% of revenue, in the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $2.6 million, or 41.0% of revenue, for the same period in 2016.\nTotal Operating Expense\nSales and marketing expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $7.3 million compared to $2.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 265%. The increase is due primarily to increases in investments in sales and marketing programs of $4.9 million, with a focus on expansion and the launch of products into China and Hong Kong, increases in human resource investments of $284,000 and increases in warehouse costs of $108,000. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $1.6 million compared to $963,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 70%. The increase was primarily due to increases in option expense of $388,000, investments in human resources of $191,000, research and development costs of $90,000 and office related costs of $7,000.\nTotal Other Expense\nTotal other expense decreased to $38,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, down from $51,000 for the same period in 2016 as a result of lower net interest expense due to a lower outstanding debt balance, which was partially offset by a gain of $6,000 on the sale of equipment in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet Income (Loss)\nAs a result of the all above, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, Celsius had a net loss of $5.2 million, and after giving effect to preferred stock dividends of $92,000, a net loss available to common stockholders of $5.3 million or ($0.12) per basic and diluted share based on a weighted average of 45,869,244 shares outstanding. In comparison, for the three months ended December 31, 2016, the company had a net loss of $420,000, and after giving effect to preferred stock dividends of $90,000, a net loss available to common stockholders of $509,000 or ($0.01) per basic and diluted share based on a weighted average of 38,680,944 shares outstanding.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash of $14.2 million compared to $11.7 million as of December 31, 2016. and working capital of $20.6 million, as compared to $15.4 million as of December 31, 2016.\nCash used in operations during the 12 months ended December 31, 2017 totaled $8.4 million.
