    "text": "HOLLAND LANDING, Ontario, March 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Inscape (TSX:INQ) today announced its third quarter financial results ended January 31, 2018. Sales in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 were $25.9 million, 11.9% higher than the same quarter of the previous year.\n“We are pleased with our performance this quarter,” said Brian Mirsky, CEO . “Despite unfavorable foreign exchange compared to the prior year, and increased investments in marketing, sales and product development, our net income was positive and our cash balance remains strong. We are continuing to invest to drive Inscape’s organic sales growth and improve manufacturing efficiencies.”\nFinancial Results\nInscape Corporation Summary of Interim Consolidated Financial Results (Unaudited) (in thousands except EPS) Three Months January 31 Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 Change Sales $ 25,906 $ 23,161 11.9 % Gross profit 7,009 7,018 -0.1 % Selling, general & administrative expenses 7,266 6,814 6.6 % Unrealized (gain) loss on foreign exchange 312 211 Unrealized (gain) loss on derivatives (1,858 ) (1,790 ) Investment income (11 ) (63 ) Income (loss) before taxes 1,300 1,846 Income taxes - - Net income (loss) $ 1,300 $ 1,846 Basic and diluted income (loss) per share $ 0.09 $ 0.13 Weighted average number of shares (in thousands) for basic EPS calculation 14,381 14,381 for diluted EPS calculation 14,406 14,570 Nine Months Ended January 31 Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 Change Sales $ 72,422 $ 74,272 -2.5 % Gross profit 20,267 22,985 -11.8 % Selling, general & administrative expenses 22,249 20,340 9.4 % Unrealized (gain) loss on foreign exchange 650 (150 ) Unrealized (gain) loss on derivatives (4,375 ) 986 Investment income (53 ) (106 ) Income (loss) before taxes 1,796 1,915 Income taxes - - Net income (loss) $ 1,796 $ 1,915 Basic and diluted income (loss) per share $ 0.12 $ 0.13 Weighted average number of shares (in thousands) for basic EPS calculation 14,381 14,381 for diluted EPS calculation 14,434 14,531 The third quarter of fiscal year 2018 ended with a net income of $1.3 million or 9 cents per share, compared with a net income of $1.8 million or 13 cents per share in the same quarter of last year. Net income of both quarters included certain unrealized, non-cash expenses and one-time items that have significant impact on the net income per GAAP. With the exclusion of these items, the third quarter of fiscal 2018 had an adjusted net income of $0.1 million, compared with adjusted net income of $2.5 million in the same quarter of last year. The adjusted net income of $0.1 million in the quarter is inclusive of a $1.5 million incremental investment in sales, marketing and product development.\nOn a year-to-date basis, the nine month period had a net income of $1.8 million, compared to a net income of $1.9 million a year ago. The current year-to-date period included certain unrealized and non-cash expense and severance obligations, which were considered as unusual operating expenses. With the exclusion of these unusual items, the year-to-date third quarter had an adjusted net loss of $1.4 million compared to adjusted net income of $4.9 million in the prior period. The adjusted year-to-date net loss of $1.4 million is inclusive of $4 million incremental investment in sales, marketing and product development.\nAdjusted net income or loss is a non-GAAP measure, which does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income and loss calculated in accordance with GAAP to the non-GAAP measure:\nThree Months Ended January 31 (in thousands) Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 NET INCOME (LOSS) $ 1,300 $ 1,846 adjust non-operating or unusual items Unrealized (gain) loss on derivatives (1,858 ) (1,790 ) Unrealized (gain) loss on foreign exchange 312 211 (Increase) Decrease in fair value of short-term investments - (69 ) Stock based compensation (26 ) 2,063 Severance obligation 347 227 ADJUSTED NET (LOSS) INCOME $ 75 $ 2,488 Nine Months Ended January 31 (in thousands) Fiscal 2018 Fiscal 2017 NET INCOME (LOSS) $ 1,796 $ 1,915 adjust non-operating or unusual items Unrealized (gain) loss on derivatives (4,375 ) 986 Unrealized (gain) loss on foreign exchange 650 (150 ) (Increase) Decrease in fair value of short-term investments - (118 ) Stock based compensation (293 ) 2,063 Severance obligation 787 233 ADJUSTED NET (LOSS) INCOME $ (1,435 ) $ 4,929 Sales in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 were $2.7 million or 11.9% higher than the same quarter of the previous year. Excluding the impact foreign exchange, third quarter sales were 21% higher than the prior year quarter due to gains realized in both the furniture and walls segments.\nYear-to-date sales declined by $1.9 million or -2.5% compared to the prior year. YTD sales are 1% higher than the prior year if we normalize foreign exchange. The previous year benefitted from two large non-recurring projects totaling $5 million which implies the run rate sales have improved.\nGross profit as a percentage of sales for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 was 27.1%, a decline from 30.3% from the same quarter of the previous year. Unfavorable foreign exchange and lower product mix negatively impacted gross profit.\nYear-to-date gross profit percentage was 28.0% compared to last year’s 30.9% due to the same factors as described in the quarter.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 were 28.0% of sales, compared to 29.4% in the same quarter of last year. The increase in SGA by $0.5 million compared to the prior year was mainly due to severance costs and investment in marketing, sales coverage and supply chain initiatives.\nYear-to-date SG&A was 30.7% of sales, compared to 27.4% for the same period of last year. The dollar amount increased by $1.9 million due to severance costs and investments in marketing, sales coverage and supply chain initiatives.\nAt the previous fiscal year ended April 30, 2017, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $6.4 million to derecognize the future income tax benefit of loss carryforwards as deferred tax assets. The off-balance sheet valuation allowance was utilized to reduce the Company’s income tax expense of the current period.\nAt the end of the quarter, the company was debt-free and had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $9.3 million and an unused credit facility.\nBoard of Directors Update\nAfter 5 decades with the company, Madan Bhayana has decided to retire as Chair and Director effective March 6, 2018. “I have enjoyed my time working with the company and am grateful for the help and support from the board over the years.
