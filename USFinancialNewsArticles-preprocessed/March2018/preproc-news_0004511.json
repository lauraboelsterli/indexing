The April contract expired on Wednesday down 1.3 percent.\nBoth benchmark contracts fell nearly 5 percent in February, the first monthly decline in six months.\n\"An extended large decline in equities has been prompting investors to avoid risk assets such as oil,\" said Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting in Tokyo.\nSome industry sources said Wednesday's decline was also due to profit-taking by market participants at the end of the month after oil hit a three-week high earlier this week.\nThe U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against six major currencies, increased for a second day on Wednesday and was slightly higher on Thursday. A stronger U.S. dollar limits demand for dollar-denominated commodities such as oil since investors paying in other currencies must pay a higher price.\nU.S. crude inventories rose by 3 million barrels last week, compared with analyst expectations for a build of 2.1 million barrels, weekly data by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed.\nGasoline stocks also rose by 2.5 million barrels against expectations for a 190,000-barrel drop, which pushed gasoline futures sharply lower. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 1 million barrels, versus expectations for a 709,000-barrel drop.\nSoaring U.S. crude production has also kept a lid on oil prices this year, even though producers, led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia, have reduced output.\nU.S. crude oil production rose to a record 10.057 million barrels per day (bpd) in November and retreated slightly in December to 9.949 million bpd, the EIA said on Wednesday.\n\"Despite the expanding output curbs by OPEC and non-OPEC members such as Russia, the market has been focusing more on rising U.S. output since around late January,\" Akuta added.\nOPEC, meanwhile, is doing its part to keep a lid on prices. The group's oil output fell in February to a 10-month low as the United Arab Emirates joined other Gulf members in over-delivering on the reduction pact, a Reuters survey found on Wednesday.\nOil prices may find some support as the U.S. is considering oil-related sanctions on OPEC member Venezuela to pressure its socialist President Nicolas Maduro, a U.S. official said on Wednesday.\nThe sanctions could target a military-run oil services company and restrict insurance coverage for Venezuelan oil shipments ahead of the country's elections on April 22.\n(Reporting by Osamu Tsukimori Editing by Joseph Radford and Christian Schmollinger)",
