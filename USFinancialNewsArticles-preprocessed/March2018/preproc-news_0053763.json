(Nasdaq: WBA) today announced financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, which ended 28 February 2018.\nExecutive Vice Chairman and CEO Stefano Pessina said, “Our growth strategy of increasing and consolidating volume, differentiating ourselves through value and quality of service, and controlling costs is bearing fruit across our businesses. This is reflected in another good set of financial results in which we delivered the highest sales growth in eight quarters, as well as strong cash generation and record U.S. pharmacy market share. We expect to continue to grow, in part through the recent acquisition of stores from Rite Aid, and today we are raising our fiscal 2018 guidance.\"\nOverview of Second Quarter Results\nFiscal 2018 second quarter net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance determined in accordance with GAAP increased 27.3 percent to $1.3 billion compared with the same quarter a year ago, while GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased 38.8 percent to $1.36 compared with the same quarter a year ago.\nAdjusted fiscal 2018 second quarter net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance 1 increased 16.6 percent to $1.7 billion, up 15.1 percent on a constant currency basis, compared with the same quarter a year ago. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the quarter increased 27.2 percent to $1.73, up 25.7 percent on a constant currency basis, compared with the same quarter a year ago.\nSales in the second quarter were $33.0 billion, an increase of 12.1 percent from the year-ago quarter, and an increase of 9.4 percent on a constant currency basis.\nGAAP operating income in the second quarter was $2.0 billion, an increase of 33.9 percent from the same quarter a year ago. Adjusted operating income in the second quarter was $2.2 billion, an increase of 7.3 percent from the same quarter a year ago, and an increase of 5.9 percent on a constant currency basis.\nGAAP net cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 billion in the second quarter, and free cash flow was $1.9 billion.\nOverview of Fiscal 2018 Year-to-Date Results\nFor the first six months of fiscal 2018, net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance determined in accordance with GAAP increased 2.6 percent to $2.2 billion compared with the same period a year ago, while GAAP diluted net earnings per share increased 11.3 percent to $2.16 compared with the same period a year ago.\nAdjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance 1 for the first six months of fiscal 2018 increased 12.7 percent to $3.0 billion, up 11.6 percent on a constant currency basis, compared with the same period a year ago. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the first six months of fiscal 2018 increased 22.4 percent to $3.01, up 21.1 percent on a constant currency basis, compared with the same period a year ago.\nSales in the first six months of fiscal 2018 were $63.8 billion, an increase of 10.0 percent from the same period a year ago, and an increase of 8.3 percent on a constant currency basis.\nGAAP operating income in the first six months of fiscal 2018 was $3.3 billion, an increase of 12.9 percent from the same period a year ago. Adjusted operating income in the first six months of the fiscal year was $4.0 billion, an increase of 6.1 percent from the same period a year ago, and an increase of 5.2 percent on a constant currency basis.\nGAAP net cash provided by operating activities was $3.2 billion in the first six months of fiscal 2018, and free cash flow was $2.5 billion.\nExpected Impact of U.S. Tax Law Changes\nThe company's GAAP effective tax rate was 27.4 percent in the second quarter and 25.4 percent in the first six months of fiscal 2018, compared with 19.0 percent and 18.2 percent for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2017, respectively.\nThe higher GAAP effective tax rates were primarily due to a provisional net discrete tax expense of $184 million as a result of the U.S. tax law changes enacted in December 2017. This expense is based on current estimates and is comprised of the accrual of a one-time transition tax partially offset by remeasurement of net U.S. deferred tax liabilities.\nThe company's adjusted effective tax rate, calculated excluding income from the company's equity investment in AmerisourceBergen Corporation, was 16.5 percent in the second quarter and 20.3 percent in the first six months of fiscal 2018, compared with 23.7 percent and 24.5 percent for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2017, respectively.\nThe lower adjusted effective tax rates were primarily due to the impact of the U.S. tax law changes.\nCompany Outlook\nThe company raised the lower and upper ends of its guidance for fiscal 2018 and now anticipates adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $5.85 to $6.05. This guidance assumes current exchange rates for the rest of the fiscal year and includes an expected benefit from the U.S. tax law changes that is marginally higher than the $0.35 per share upper end of the previously announced range. As previously announced, the company does not expect Rite Aid to significantly impact fiscal 2018 adjusted diluted net earnings per share. The company now expects to obtain a cash tax benefit from the U.S. tax law changes in excess of $350 million for fiscal year 2018, compared with the previous estimate, announced in January, of more than $200 million.\nSecond Quarter Business Division Highlights\nRetail Pharmacy USA:\nRetail Pharmacy USA had second quarter sales of $24.5 billion, an increase of 12.2 percent over the year-ago quarter. Sales in comparable stores increased 2.4 percent compared with the same quarter a year ago.\nPharmacy sales, which accounted for 70.3 percent of the division’s sales in the quarter, increased 18.7 percent compared with the year-ago quarter, primarily due to higher prescription volume including central specialty and mail following the formation of AllianceRx Walgreens Prime and from the acquisition of Rite Aid stores. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 5.1 percent, primarily due to higher volume. Reimbursement pressure and generics had a negative impact on comparable pharmacy sales growth, which was partially offset by brand inflation. The division filled 269.2 million prescriptions (including immunizations) adjusted to 30-day equivalents in the quarter, an increase of 9.1 percent over the year-ago quarter. Prescriptions filled in comparable stores increased 4.0 percent compared with the same quarter a year ago, primarily due to volume growth from previously announced strategic pharmacy partnerships and Medicare Part D growth. The division’s retail prescription market share on a 30-day adjusted basis in the second quarter increased approximately 100 basis points over the year-ago quarter to 21.4 percent, as reported by IQVIA (formerly IMS Health). This was the division's highest reported quarterly retail prescription market share in the U.S.\nRetail sales decreased 0.7 percent in the second quarter compared with the year-ago period. Comparable retail sales were down 2.7 percent in the quarter.\nGAAP gross profit increased 6.7 percent compared with the same quarter a year ago and adjusted gross profit increased 6.6 percent. On an adjusted basis, pharmacy and retail gross profit both increased.\nGAAP second quarter selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) as a percentage of sales decreased 1.9 percentage points compared with the year-ago quarter, primarily due to costs related to the cost transformation program in the year-ago quarter and to sales mix and higher prescription volume in the quarter. On an adjusted basis, SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 0.9 percentage point in the same period, primarily due to sales mix and higher prescription volume.\nGAAP operating income in the second quarter increased 25.2 percent from the year-ago quarter to $1.4 billion. Adjusted operating income in the second quarter increased 6.3 percent from the year-ago quarter to $1.6 billion.\nAs of the end of the second quarter the company had acquired 1,542 Rite Aid stores under the previously announced amended and restated asset purchase agreement. Since the end of the quarter the company completed the acquisition of all 1,932 stores. The transition of three distribution centers and related inventory is expected to begin during fiscal 2019.\nThe company continues to expect to complete integration of the acquired stores and related assets by the end of fiscal 2020, as previously announced.\nAs part of a program to optimize locations, the company continues to expect to close approximately 600 stores and related assets over an 18-month period, resulting in estimated pre-tax charges to the company's GAAP financial results of approximately $450 million. This program commenced in March. Cost savings from the program are still anticipated to be approximately $300 million per year and are still expected to be fully delivered by the end of fiscal 2020.\nRetail Pharmacy International:\nRetail Pharmacy International had second quarter sales of $3.3 billion, an increase of 7.0 percent from the year-ago quarter due to currency translation. Sales decreased 2.6 percent on a constant currency basis.\nOn a constant currency basis, comparable store sales decreased 1.7 percent compared with the year-ago quarter. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 0.6 percent on a constant currency basis. Comparable retail sales decreased 2.8 percent on a constant currency basis mainly due to Boots UK.\nGAAP gross profit increased 7.5 percent compared with the same quarter a year ago due to currency translation. On a constant currency basis, adjusted gross profit decreased 2.3 percent.\nGAAP SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 1.0 percentage point. Adjusted SG&A as a percentage of sales, on a constant currency basis, decreased 0.6 percentage point.\nGAAP operating income in the second quarter increased 27.3 percent from the year-ago quarter to $252 million, while adjusted operating income increased 15.7 percent to $280 million, up 6.6 percent on a constant currency basis due to lower SG&A.\nPharmaceutical Wholesale:\nPharmaceutical Wholesale had second quarter sales of $5.8 billion, an increase of 14.4 percent from the year-ago quarter, mainly due to currency translation. On a constant currency basis, comparable sales increased 3.4 percent, which was behind the company’s estimate of market growth, weighted on the basis of country wholesale sales, due to challenging market conditions in certain continental European countries partially offset by strong performance in emerging markets.\nGAAP operating income in the second quarter was $323 million, which included $202 million from the company’s equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen, compared with GAAP operating income of $165 million in the year-ago quarter, which included $42 million from the company's equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen. Adjusted operating income increased 2.2 percent to $231 million, down 1.3 percent on a constant currency basis.\nConference Call\nWalgreens Boots Alliance will hold a one-hour conference call to discuss the second quarter results beginning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time today, 28 March 2018.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)\nREGARDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following information provides reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under SEC rules, presented in this press release to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures in the press release, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThese supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management has evaluated the Company’s financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believe that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company’s business from period to period and trends in the Company’s historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented in the press release. The Company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates on a forward-looking basis (including the information under “Company Outlook” above) where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company’s control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted, and that would impact diluted net earnings per share, the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures provided without the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.\nConstant currency\nThe Company also presents certain information related to current period operating results in “constant currency,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure. These amounts are calculated by translating current period results at the foreign currency exchange rates used in the comparable period in the prior year. The Company presents such constant currency financial information because it has significant operations outside of the United States reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and this presentation provides a framework to assess how its business performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nComparable sales\nFor our Retail Pharmacy divisions, comparable stores are defined as those that have been open for at least 12 consecutive months and that have not been closed for seven or more consecutive days, undergone a major remodel or been subject to a natural disaster during the past 12 months. Relocated and acquired stores are not included as comparable stores for the first 12 months after the relocation or acquisition. Comparable store sales, comparable pharmacy sales and comparable retail sales refer to total sales, pharmacy sales and retail sales, respectively, in such stores. For our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division, comparable sales are defined as sales excluding acquisitions and dispositions. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the industries in which we operate. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other companies’ methods.\nComparable sales are presented on a constant currency basis for the Retail Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the year-ago quarter, the Retail Pharmacy International division’s comparable store sales on a reported currency basis increased 8.0 percent, comparable pharmacy sales on a reported currency basis increased 10.6 percent and comparable retail sales on a reported currency basis increased 6.7 percent. The Pharmaceutical Wholesale division’s comparable sales excluding acquisitions and dispositions on a reported currency basis increased 14.4 percent.\nNET EARNINGS AND DILUTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThree months ended Six months ended February 28, February 28, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.

This measure does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures as the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments for future business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our entire statements of cash flows.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180328005245/en/\nWalgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.\nMedia Relations\nUSA / Michael Polzin, +1 847 315 2935\nor\nInternational / Laura Vergani, +44 (0)207 980 8585\nor\nInvestor Relations\nGerald Gradwell and Ashish Kohli, +1 847 315 2922\nSource: Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc.",
