    "text": "BOSTON, March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Liberty Mutual Insurance has appointed Shelia Anderson to the newly created role of Corporate Functions Chief Information Officer, reporting to Liberty Mutual's Executive Vice President and CIO James McGlennon. Based in Boston, Anderson will focus on enabling customer success for the corporate functions department, B2B architecture, and modernizing and digitizing core systems and processes.\n\"To keep up with customer expectations and to stay relevant, every company – including Fortune 100 companies like us – must become faster, more agile and increasingly open to smart risk-taking, innovation and new ways of working,\" said McGlennon. \"Whether those customers are internal or external, we need to develop products that keep pace with their changing expectations and enhance their user experience. Shelia and her team will work with our internal corporate functions – legal, benefits, talent and enterprise services – to focus on system automation, their move to the cloud, and applications designed to streamline their work.\"\nIn addition to working on products and applications for Liberty's policyholders – such as the recently launched iBuyMotocycle, the digital buying experience for motorcycle insurance –McGlennon's technology team also develops innovative internal products to help the company remain competitive. One example of their work is the Cat-i application, which provides a faster, more accurate way to communicate catastrophe risk to senior management. Better information leads to better decisions concerning risk management, claims responses, and other areas of Liberty Mutual's business, ultimately improving the customer experience.\n\"I was drawn to Liberty for its culture of innovation and James's dedication to pushing the technology envelope,\" said Anderson. \"I'm excited to join the organization and look forward to partnering with the team to use emerging technology and create solutions that help Liberty compete and succeed in the global marketplace.\"\nAnderson has held senior level technology roles with several Fortune 500 global technology organizations, including HP and Electronic Data Systems. She most recently served as vice president and CIO for Property and Casualty Insurance at USAA. She received her BS in computer science from Louisiana Tech University and her MS in engineering management from Southern Methodist University.\nCheck out more examples of innovation and transformation at Liberty Mutual, by visiting our careers site at https://www.jobs.libertymutualgroup.com/technology-jobs .\nAbout Liberty Mutual Insurance\nLiberty Mutual's purpose is to help people embrace today and confidently pursue tomorrow.
