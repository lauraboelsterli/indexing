    "text": "AKRON, Ohio, March 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A. Schulman, Inc. (Nasdaq:SHLM) today announced its financial results for the fiscal 2018 second quarter ended February 28, 2018. The Company reported quarterly net income available to common stockholders of $3.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share. Last year the Company reported second quarter comparable net income of $3.2 million, or $0.11 per diluted share.\nConsolidated net sales for the three months ended February 28, 2018 were $650.1 million, a 14.3% increase compared with $568.7 million for the prior period. Excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency of $43.1 million, net sales increased by 6.7% with positive contributions from all segments primarily due to improved mix and efforts to offset increased raw material prices.\nWorking Capital/Cash Flow\nNet cash used in operations was $12.6 million for the six months ended February 28, 2018, compared to a source of $40.1 million for the six months ended February 28, 2017. Working capital days were 54 at the end of the second quarter compared with 45 days at the end of fiscal 2017, driven by inventory build, higher raw material prices, and the impact of foreign currency translation.\nCapital expenditures for the six months ended February 28, 2018 were $13.1 million compared with $24.5 million in the prior year period. Additionally, the Company declared and paid quarterly cash dividends to common stockholders of $6.0 million, or $0.205 per common share, and also paid quarterly dividends of $1.9 million to holders of the convertible special stock. Total debt rose by $33 million since the end of fiscal 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nAs a result of U.S. Tax Reform, the Company will be subject to a U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 25.7% for its fiscal year ending August 31, 2018, which reflects a blended federal statutory rate of 35% for its first four months and 21% for the remaining eight months.\nFor the quarter, the Company's effective tax rate was significantly lower than the blended U.S. federal statutory rate of 25.7% primarily due to the discrete impacts of U.S. Tax Reform. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, as a result of U.S. Tax Reform, the Company recorded a discrete non-cash tax benefit of $6.8 million due to the remeasurement of U.S deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nIn addition, the Company analyzed the impact of the one-time transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which should be fully offset by foreign tax credits carried forward from prior years and the related release of valuation allowance previously recorded against those credits. Additional detail is available in the Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended February 28, 2018.\nPending Merger\nOn February 15, 2018, LyondellBasell (NYSE:LYB), and A. Schulman, Inc. announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which LyondellBasell will purchase 100 percent of A. Schulman common stock for (i) $42.00 per share in cash, without interest and subject to any applicable withholding taxes (the \"Per-Share Amount\"), and (ii) one contractual contingent value right per share without interest and less applicable withholding taxes (a \"CVR\"), which will represent the right to receive certain net proceeds, if any, resulting from the Lucent matter (in each case subject to the terms and conditions of the CVR agreement to be entered into in accordance with the Merger Agreement). There is no guaranty that any payment will be received with respect to the contingent value rights. The proposed acquisition, which has been unanimously approved by the respective boards of LyondellBasell and A. Schulman, is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and approval by A. Schulman stockholders. The acquisition is expected to close in the second half of calendar year 2018.\nAdditional Information\nIn light of the pending merger, the Company has suspended its fiscal 2018 guidance. The Company will not host an investor conference call this quarter.
