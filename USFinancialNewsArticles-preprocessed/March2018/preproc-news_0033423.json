(NASDAQ:BDSI) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 and provided an update on recent business highlights.\n“We achieved strong revenue growth in both the fourth quarter and full-year 2017, driven by continued BELBUCA prescription growth,” said Scott M. Plesha, President of BioDelivery Sciences. “For full-year 2017, we recorded BELBUCA prescription growth of 84% over 2016. The momentum we experienced with BELBUCA in 2017 has extended into 2018, as we reached an all-time high in monthly prescriptions of over 8,600 prescriptions in January and are on track for strong results in February following the highest 4-week total in prescriptions we have seen to date. We believe that BDSI is well-positioned to continue our growth trend with BELBUCA, as we have increased the size of our sales force, undertaken new marketing initiatives and achieved significant progress with new and improved managed care contracts.\"\n“Additionally, we are particularly pleased with the addition of both commercial and Medicare preferred coverage of BELBUCA by Humana, effective the first of this month, particularly given that Humana is the second largest Medicare insurer in the country based on lives under management,” continued Mr. Plesha. “This, along with new and improved coverage secured earlier this quarter with two other major payers, point to growing interest in, and improved access to, Schedule III options like BELBUCA.”\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights\nNet revenue for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, was $12.5 million, compared to $11.3 million in the third quarter of 2017, an increase of 11%, and $3.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of 220%.\nTotal net revenue for BELBUCA (buprenorphine) buccal film and BUNAVAIL® (buprenorphine and naloxone) buccal film in the fourth quarter was $9.4 million and $1.7 million, respectively, versus $6.4 million and $1.7 million, in the third quarter of 2017. This compares to royalty revenue on BELBUCA from BDSI’s former commercial partner, Endo, of $1.3 million, and BUNAVAIL revenue of $2.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nTotal operating expenses for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, were $21.6 million, compared to $16.9 million and $16.8 million in the third quarter of 2017 and fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. Increased operating expenses in the fourth quarter were due to a one-time charge associated with joining the opioid consortium, which is a collaborative effort among manufacturers of long-acting opioids to jointly fulfill FDA post-marketing study requirements. While BDSI will contribute to the costs associated with certain studies going forward, BDSI was required to provide funding in arrears for work completed prior to joining to the group. Participation in the opioid consortium allows the expenses associated with most of the post-approval study requirements to be shared among the participating companies instead of being conducted individually.\nNet loss for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, was $16.2 million, or ($0.29) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $12.0 million, or ($0.21) per diluted share, in the third quarter. This compares to a net loss of $15.9 million, or ($0.29) per diluted share, in the same period of 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, BDSI had cash of approximately $21.2 million. This compares to cash of approximately $19.7 million at September 30, 2017. In the fourth quarter, BDSI met the financial criteria to access a $15 million tranche in its loan agreement with CRG.\nFull-Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nNet revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $62.0 million, compared to $15.5 million for 2016. Total net sales of BELBUCA and BUNAVAIL for the 12-months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, were $27.0 million and $7.9 million, respectively. Also recognized in net revenue for the 12-months ended December 31, 2017, was $20 million of deferred revenue for BELBUCA upon termination of BDSI’s commercialization license with Endo.\nTotal operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017, were $71.9 million, compared to $68.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2017, was $5.3 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $67.1 million, or ($1.25) per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net income was principally attributable to BELBUCA net profitability, favorable valuation of the reacquisition of BELBUCA and recognition of deferred revenue associated with the commercialization license termination with Endo.\nRECENT COMPANY HIGHLIGHTS\nCommercial\nAchieved solid BELBUCA growth in the fourth quarter, with total prescription sales increasing 10% over the prior quarter. BELBUCA total prescriptions reached their highest monthly total to date in January 2018 with over 8,600 prescriptions, and BELBUCA results are expected to be strong in February and into March, as the rolling 4-week prescription total is the highest recorded to date. BELBUCA sales metrics demonstrated meaningful first year improvement since termination of the Endo commercial license and commencement of BDSI’s own commercialization efforts with BELBUCA, with prescriptions in 2017 up 84% over 2016. Recently signed a commercial and Medicare agreement with Humana adding BELBUCA as a preferred agent that became effective on March 1, 2018. Humana is the second largest provider in terms of Medicare lives under management, with more than 7.7 million currently participating in Humana Part D benefits. BDSI also secured new coverage early in the first quarter of 2018 with a number of significant additional plans, including ProCareRx, which moved BELBUCA from non-formulary, not covered, to a preferred agent, and improved coverage through other plans, such as United Healthcare, which removed step-through requirements to access BELBUCA. Recently increased number of sales representatives from 65 to 85 adding over 3,500 new healthcare practitioner targets and multiple new geographies not previously covered by BDSI’s sales force. Effective January 30, 2018, BELBUCA is commercially available in Canada via BDSI’s exclusive agreement with Purdue (Canada). BDSI has received upfront and milestone payments under this agreement and is eligible for additional milestones and royalties on net sales. BUNAVAIL contract with TennCare renewed for 2 years at a more favorable discount rate to BDSI.\nCorporate\nAppointed Scott M. Plesha, formerly BDSI’s Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing, to the role of President, effective January 2, 2018. Entered into non-exclusive licenses with Teva that will not allow them to begin selling generic versions of BELBUCA in the U.S. until January 23, 2027, and BUNAVAIL until July 23, 2018, or potentially earlier under certain conditions. These settlements provide additional certainty with respect to BDSI’s patent portfolio, while averting future costs associated with litigation. BDSI reacquired ONSOLIS ® (fentanyl buccal soluble film) from Collegium Pharmaceutical, Inc. and is currently assessing options for commercializing the product, including the use of BDSI’s own sales force or potentially out-licensing the product.\nConference Call & Webcast\nThursday, March 15th @ 4:30pm Eastern Time\nDomestic: 866-548-4713 International: 323-794-2093 Passcode: 6437809 Webcast: http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=128377 Replays available through March 29: Domestic: 844-512-2921 International: 412-317-6671 Conference ID: 6437809 About BioDelivery Sciences International\nBioDelivery Sciences International, Inc.
