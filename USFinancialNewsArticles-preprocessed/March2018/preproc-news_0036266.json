    "text": "Getty Images Chris Liddell \nWASHINGTON—President Donald Trump has elevated Chris Liddell, who now serves in a White House office aimed at streamlining the federal government, to deputy chief of staff for policy coordination, the White House press secretary said Monday. \nLiddell, a former Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -2.06% and General Motors Co. GM, -1.95% executive who was under consideration earlier this month to serve as the next director of the National Economic Council, will be a second deputy to White House Chief of Staff John Kelly. Trump last week named CNBC commentator Lawrence Kudlow to lead the NEC, which is the White House’s top economic-advisory post. He will succeed the departing Gary Cohn. \n“Chris is widely respected across the administration and is highly qualified to oversee and coordinate our policy process,” Kelly said in a statement. “We look forward to having him in this new role.” Kelly’s other deputy is Joe Hagin, who oversees White House operations.",
