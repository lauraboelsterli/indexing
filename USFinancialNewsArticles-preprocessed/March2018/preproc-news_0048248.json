    "text": "BRIDGEVIEW, Ill., March 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Manitex International, Inc. (Nasdaq:MNTX) , a leading international provider of truck and knuckle boom cranes, today announced Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 results. Net revenues for the fourth quarter were $64.5 million, compared to $41.1 million in the prior year’s period, and net loss from continuing operations attributable to shareholders of Manitex of $(0.6) million, or $(0.04) per share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations attributable to shareholders of Manitex of $(6.0) million, or $(0.37) per share, in 2016. Adjusted net income* from continuing operations in the fourth quarter 2017 was $0.9 million, or $0.05 per share, compared to adjusted net loss of $(1.7) million, or $(0.10) per share, 2016.\nFor the full year 2017, Manitex reported net revenues of $213.1 million and net loss from continuing operations of ($7.1) million, or ($0.43) per share, compared with net revenues of $173.2 million and net loss from continuing operations of ($23.2) million, or ($1.44) per share for the full year 2016. Adjusted net income* from continuing operations for the full year 2017 was $3.3 million or $0.20 per share, compared to adjusted net loss of $(8.9) million, or $(0.55) per share, in 2016.\nAll references in this release to financial results of periods ending prior to the third quarter of 2017 reflect such results as restated pursuant to the previously announced restatement of such periods. Manitex plans to file amended reports with the SEC covering all periods affected by the restatement, as well as its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 on March 30, 2018, and its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 by April 6, 2018.\nHighlights:\nQ4 2017 net revenues of $64.5 million represents a year-over-year growth of 56.9% compared to Q4 2016 Sequentially, net revenues grew 14.2% in fourth quarter 2017 compared to third quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA* for the full year 2017 increased by 272% to $13.8 million compared to $3.7 million in 2016 Adjusted EBITDA margin also increased to 6.5% as a percent of sales for the full year in 2017, compared to 2.1% of sales for the previous year Adjusted earnings per share for the full year 2017 improved to $0.20 compared to an adjusted loss per share of $(0.55) in 2016 Net debt at year end of $89.9 million was lower by $11 million compared to the prior year Backlog at year end increased by $31 million to $62.2 million compared to December 31, 2016, and by 23.7% from September 30, 2017\n*Adjusted Numbers are discussed in greater detail under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Items” at the end of this release.\nSubsequent to the end of the Fourth Quarter:\nBacklog increased to $87.3 million as of February 28, 2018, an increase of 40% since December 31, 2017 Began shipping new A62 truck mounted aerial work platform and the Trolley Boom Loader in North America All prior period reports affected by the restatement expected to be filed by March 30, 2018\nDavid Langevin, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Manitex, commented, “While our restatement created a distraction concerning our 2017 financials, operationally we saw solid improvements throughout the year. Sales are up substantially in 2017 as well as adjusted operating income, EBITDA and earning per share. Equally important was our reduction in outstanding debt year-over-year, along with the substantial strengthening in the strategic direction of the Company to a point where we believe that we are now one of the premier mobile crane companies in the world. Given the 40% increase in our backlog since December 31, 2017, we believe we will see a steady continuation of improving metrics as we move through 2018. Our goals for 2018 are for us to simply execute on the business levels which we see developing, increase our EBITDA percentages to a level that is much closer to our stated goal of 10%, use our cash flow to continue to reduce debt and potentially further prune nonstrategic assets.”\nSteve Kiefer, President and Chief Operating Officer of Manitex, stated, “During the fourth-quarter of 2017, we saw an increase in orders and market share for our key product categories, and welcomed eight new dealer locations to the PM North American dealer network. The recovery of the straight mast crane market has strengthened during the first quarter of 2018, with industry orders approaching levels last observed during the 2012 – 2015 timeframe. Looking forward, strong market demand for our products, the build-out of the PM dealer network in North America, and solid customer acceptance of our new products position the Company well for improved revenue and profitability in 2018 and beyond.”\nOther Matters :\nAs previously disclosed, the Company has received an informal inquiry from the SEC requesting certain information in connection with the Company’s previously announced restatement of prior financial statements and is continuing to comply with such request.\nConference Call :\nManagement will host a conference call at 4:30 PM Eastern Time today to discuss the results with the investment community. Anyone interested in participating in the call should dial 800-239-9838 if calling within the United States or 323-794-2551 if calling internationally. A replay will be available until April 4, 2018 which can be accessed by dialing 844-512-2921 if calling within the United States, or 412-317-6671 if calling internationally.

The call will additionally be broadcast live and archived for 90 days over the internet with accompanying slides, accessible at the investor relations portion of the Company's corporate website, www.manitexinternational.com/eventspresentations.aspx .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Other Items\nResults of operations reflect continuing operations. All per share amounts are on a fully diluted basis. In this press release, Manitex refers to various non-GAAP (U.S. generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures which management believes provides useful information to investors. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures being disclosed by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings, operating income and other consolidated earnings data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of our profitability. A reconciliation of Adjusted GAAP financial measures for the three month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 is included with this press release below and with the Company's related Form 8-K.\nManagement of Manitex uses both GAAP and non–GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance, to establish internal budgets and targets, and to compare the Company’s financial performance against such budgets and targets. While adjusted financial measures are not intended to replace any presentation included in our consolidated financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and should not be considered an alternative to operating performance or an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity, we believe these measures are useful to investors in assessing our operating results, capital expenditure and working capital requirements and the ongoing performance of its underlying businesses. The amounts described below are unaudited, are reported in thousands of U.S. dollars, and are as of, or for the twelve and three month period ended December 31, 2017, unless otherwise indicated.\nAbout Manitex International, Inc.\nManitex International, Inc. is a leading worldwide provider of highly engineered specialized equipment including boom truck, truck and knuckle boom cranes.
