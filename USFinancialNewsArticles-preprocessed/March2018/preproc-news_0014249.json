    "text": "Devices unveiled today at AAOS Annual Meeting in New Orleans\nLEWISVILLE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Orthofix International N.V., (NASDAQ:OFIX), a global medical device company focused on musculoskeletal healing products and value added services, announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European CE Mark approvals for its next-generation PhysioStim ™ bone growth stimulators.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180307005078/en/\nOrthofix PhysioStim Bone Growth Stimulator (Photo: Business Wire)\nThe PhysioStim devices provide a non-surgical treatment option for patients who have a nonunion fracture to an extremity that has shown no visible signs of healing. These Class III medical devices use a pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) signal to induce a low-level electrical field at the fracture site which stimulates bone healing.\n“We are proud to provide physicians with these next-generation devices that will enable them to redefine how patients with nonunion fractures are treated,” said Brad Niemann, President of the Orthofix BioStim strategic business unit. “These devices are built on our proprietary PEMF technology platform. Together with our spinal fusion stimulators, they are currently the No. 1 prescribed bone growth stimulators in the U.S.”\nThe PhysioStim devices will be accompanied by a new application for mobile devices, STIM onTrack ™ . Designed for use with smartphones and other mobile devices, STIM onTrack is free and available in the U.S. through the iTunes App Store. The STIM onTrack mobile app includes a first-to-market feature that enables physicians to remotely view patient adherence to their prescription. Additionally, the app engages patients in their recovery process through treatment calendars, therapy reminders and educational resources.\n“Bone growth stimulation therapy is a safe, effective and proven treatment for patients who have a fracture to an extremity that won’t heal,” said James Ryaby, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer at Orthofix. “When patients follow their prescription, their rate of successful healing is improved. The new mobile app is a great tool to foster better adherence to the prescribed treatment because it empowers the patient to take an active part in their recovery.”\nThe PhysioStim devices come in different models and are designed to anatomically fit the patient’s body. Specific applications are for treatment of nonunion fractures to the arm, hand, wrist, clavicle, shoulder, hip, thigh, lower leg, ankle or foot. The devices can be worn over clothing, casts or internal and external surgical fixation devices.
