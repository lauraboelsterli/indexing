    "text": "Kevin Labanc scored the decisive goal in a shootout round, and the San Jose Sharks won their eighth game in a row with a 4-3 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks on Monday night at the United Center.\nLogan Couture also scored during the shootout round for San Jose, which has not lost a game in more than two weeks. Marcus Sorensen, Evander Kane and Tomas Hertl scored in regulation for the Sharks.\nAlex DeBrincat, Connor Murphy and Patrick Sharp each tallied goals for the Blackhawks. Sharp also scored during the shootout round.\nSharks goaltender Martin Jones stopped 28 shots in regulation and overtime. He denied Patrick Kane, DeBrincat and Nick Schmaltz during the shootout to improve to 29-18-6.\nBlackhawks goaltender Anton Forsberg made 35 saves in regulation and overtime.\nSan Jose opened the scoring with 10:45 to go in the first period. Right winger Jannik Hansen carried the puck through the offensive zone and behind the net to attract the Blackhawks’ attention. Hansen quickly slid a pass toward Sorensen, who punched in a shot from the crease for his fifth goal.\nChicago evened the score at 1-1 with 4:28 remaining in the first period. Jones stopped a booming slap shot from Vinnie Hinostroza but kicked a rebound in front of the net. DeBrincat capitalized for his 26th goal of the season. DeBrincat has four goals in his past five games.\nSeventy-eight seconds later, Murphy scored on a slap shot through traffic to give Chicago a 2-1 advantage.\nA breakaway goal by San Jose’s Kane made it 2-all with 3:21 to go in the second period. Forsberg stopped the initial shot, but the puck trickled between the goaltender’s pads for Kane’s eighth goal in 13 games with the Sharks.\nThe Sharks grabbed a 3-2 lead with 4:19 left in the third period. Hertl charged toward the right side of the crease and scored on a wrist shot for his fifth goal in the past seven games.\nChicago quickly responded to even the score at 3-3 with 2:22 remaining in regulation. Sharp netted his 10th goal, which marked his 11th season with double-digit goals.\nVictor Ejdsell made his NHL debut for the Blackhawks. He recorded three shots on goal.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
