    "text": "84 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—Health insurers have largely adjusted to the impact of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the White House will say in an economic report Wednesday, a finding that will likely undercut lawmakers’ efforts to secure federal funds to blunt potential premium increases for the coming year.\nRepublicans, Democrats and the White House are negotiating the provisions of a major spending bill that must pass by Saturday or risk a government shutdown. The insurance payments are part of those discussions.\nThe subsidies are an explosive issue for Republicans who say they are opposed to the law they dubbed Obamacare, but some GOP lawmakers and many Democrats worry about the effects of rickety insurance markets on their constituents.\nThe White House report, from the Council of Economic Advisers, says that insurers’ financial well-being, “as measured by their stock prices,” has improved in the four years since the main provisions of the health law were implemented. Health-insurance stocks increased by 272% from 2014 to 2018, the report says.\nThe CEA says that some of those gains can be ascribed to insurers’ role in running Medicaid programs for states, as enrollment in the government-funded program for low-income Americans expanded as part of the health law. Health plans are getting an additional boost from the tax-system overhaul passed by Republicans in late 2017, it concludes.\nWhile insurers struggled initially to price insurance accurately and some withdrew from the exchanges entirely after the law’s enactment, the plans that remain have adjusted to their new environment for doing business, the report says.\n“As of 2017, most Blue Cross Blue Shield regional insurers, the main insurers left in the ACA-compliant individual and small-group markets, have better profit margins than during the initial years of offering plans in marketplaces and have returned to pre-ACA profitability,” the report says, citing work by Mark Farrah Associates on the Blue plans’ stability.\nBut industry officials say the health of a company can’t be judged by stock prices alone, and many of the biggest publicly traded companies have pulled back on the individual insurance market. Meanwhile, Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans—many of which aren’t publicly traded that have been among the most vocal in saying they continue to struggle in many states, where they have too many expensive enrollees and not enough healthy members to keep those costs in check.\nThey routinely warn of tough decisions about whether to continue serving markets where they have been the dominant plan for decades, and said they need more federal support, including funds.\nInsurers are also weighing whether they will have further problems as a result of the repeal of the health law’s individual mandate , which was included in the tax overhaul bill. The mandate has generally been credited with prodding healthier people to sign up for coverage.\nSome health insurers said in previous regulatory filings they had already discounted the mandate because of lax enforcement, but others indicated they hadn’t made that assumption and could plan to increase premiums now.\nThe report also could undermine President Donald Trump’s assertions that insurance markets were imploding and that their woes would ultimately give his party the opportunity to remake the law they sought unsuccessfully to repeal for much of 2017.\n“While insurers initially incurred losses in the ACA marketplaces as they adjusted to new regulations and a relatively unhealthy risk pool, insurers are now profiting on the individual market as well, with higher premiums that are largely covered by federal premium subsidies,” the brief concludes.\nInsurers will begin filing their proposals for 2019 within weeks, though state regulators then spend months reviewing them. Final premiums are typically seen in early November for people who buy their own health plans, rather than getting coverage through an employer or government program such as Medicaid or Medicare.\nWrite to Louise Radnofsky at louise.radnofsky@wsj.com",
