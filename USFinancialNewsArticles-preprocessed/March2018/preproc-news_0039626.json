    "text": "FAIRFAX, Va., March 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MainStreet Bancshares, Inc. (OTCQX: MNSB), the holding company for MainStreet Bank, announced today that its board of directors declared a five percent (5.0%) stock dividend on all shares of its outstanding common stock.\nThe stock dividend will entitle all shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 9, 2018 to receive one additional share of common stock for every twenty shares of common stock held on that date. The additional shares will be distributed to shareholders on or about April 30, 2018. Cash will be paid in lieu of issuing fractional shares.\nThe company currently has approximately 5.5 million shares of common stock outstanding, and after giving effect to the stock split, will have approximately 5.8 million shares outstanding.\nABOUT MAINSTREET BANK: MainStreet is opening its sixth branch in April 2018. The new branch is at 307 East Market Street in Leesburg Virginia. MainStreet's five existing branches are located in Herndon, Fairfax, Fairfax City, McLean and Clarendon. In addition, MainStreet has 55,000 free ATMs and a fully integrated online and mobile banking solution. The Bank is not restricted by a conventional branching system, as it can offer business customers the ability to Put Our Bank in Your Office ® . With robust and easy-to-use online business banking technology, MainStreet has literally \"put our bank\" in over 1,000 businesses in the Metropolitan area.\nMainStreet has a full complement of payment system services for third party payment providers. MainStreet has a nationally known market leader on-staff ready to help payment providers create a solution perfect for their needs.\nMainStreet has a robust line of business and professional lending products, including government contracting lines of credit, commercial lines and term loans, residential and commercial construction and commercial real estate. MainStreet also works with the SBA to offer 7A and 504 lending solutions. From mobile banking and Apple Pay to instant-issue Debit Cards, MainStreet Bank is always looking for ways to improve its customer experience. Additionally, MainStreet released Aircharity ® in 2012. Aircharity ® is a unique solution that empowers people and organizations to raise money via email, websites and social media. The product allows a customer to open an account and accept donations from debit cards, credit cards and electronic checks.\nMainStreet Bank was the first community bank in the Washington, DC Metropolitan area to offer a full online business banking solution. MainStreet Bank was also the first bank headquartered in the Commonwealth of Virginia to offer CDARS – a solution that provides multi-million-dollar FDIC insurance. Further information on the Bank can be obtained by visiting its website at mstreetbank.com .\nThis release contains forward-looking statements, including our expectations with respect to future events that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's projections, forecasts, estimates and expectations include: fluctuation in market rates of interest and loan and deposit pricing, adverse changes in the overall national economy as well as adverse economic conditions in our specific market areas, maintenance and development of well-established and valued client relationships and referral source relationships, and acquisition or loss of key production personnel. Other risks that can affect the Bank are detailed from time to time in our annual reports. We caution readers that the list of factors above is not exclusive. The forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this release, and we may not undertake steps to update the forward-looking statements to reflect the impact of any circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statements are made. In addition, our past results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future performance.\nContact: Jeff W.
