    "text": "March 15, 2018 \nGoogle Maps will now show wheelchair accessible routes in cities like Boston, New York, and London. \nThe search giant said Thursday that people can now use Google Maps to get directions that are catered specifically to people with mobility problems. \nAlthough people can use Google Maps to get around using public transit, those routes may not be best suited for people with wheelchairs or who have other disabilities. \nGoogle (goog) said that it teamed with transit agencies to help it catalogue the best wheelchair-accessible routes. To find those routes, Google Maps users enter where they want to go, tap on the “Directions” tab, and then choose “wheelchair accessible” as one of the options under the “Routes” section. \nThe company is debuting the new feature in major metropolitan areas worldwide. In addition to Boston, New York, and London, the option is available for Tokyo, Mexico City, and Sydney. \nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \n“We’re looking forward to working with additional transit agencies in the coming months to bring more wheelchair accessible routes to Google Maps,” Google product manager Rio Akasaka said in a blog post .
