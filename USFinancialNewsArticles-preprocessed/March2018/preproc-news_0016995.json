    "text": "Brands from The Economist to beer-maker BrewDog are running campaigns in support of International Women's Day this year.\nCNBC takes a look at some of them.\nState Street Global Advisors – Fearless Girl Anadolu Agency | Getty Images The business behind the \"Fearless Girl\" statue that faced up to Wall Street's \"Charging Bull\" on International Women's Day 2017 (and won agency McCann New York four awards at Cannes Lions) has been campaigning for companies to appoint more women to their boards.\nMore than 150 of the 787 businesses State Street Global Advisors lobbied over the past year now have at least one female board member, according to a statement emailed to CNBC.\nState Street is also working with New York City's mayor's office to find a permanent location for \"Fearless Girl.\"\nGirl Crew - Fearless Friend GirlCrew.com Fearless Friend, a flower \"statue\" by GirlCrew.com, faces a statue of a bull at the Bullring shopping mall in Birmingham, U.K. Inspired by \"Fearless Girl,\" U.K. friend-making app Girl Crew has created a \"Fearless Friend\" sculpture made out of flowers that appeared Thursday morning outside the Bullring, a shopping mall in Birmingham.\nShe holds a megaphone in one hand, \"a symbol that women of all ages will be heard,\" according to a statement emailed to CNBC.\nBarbie – Shero Mattel Mattel has made a range of 'Shero' Barbies for International Women's Day 2018 Mattel is making a new set of Barbie dolls for International Women's Day, including of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, British boxer Nicola Adams and U.S. snowboarding champion Chloe Kim.\nIts \"shero\" program started in 2015, to celebrate women's roles \"in expanding the possibilities for girls everywhere,\" according to an online statement.\nBrawny – Strength Has No Gender Brawny Paper towel company Brawny is running a campaign in support of women for International Women's Day 2018 The paper towel brand is also using a \"sheroes\" theme, replacing its regular strong man image with a woman and the line \"strength has no gender,\" for Women's History Month.\nIt has also made short films starring bricklayer Vanessa Casillas, Marine Corps veteran Rachael Wilson and Sarah Herron, founder of SheLift, a non-profit organization that arranges adventures for women with disabilities.\nBrewDog - Pink IPA BrewDog BrewDog has changed labels on its Punk IPA bottles to \"Pink IPA\" for International Women's Day 2018 British beer-maker BrewDog has launched a tongue-in-cheek drink called Pink IPA (India Pale Ale), a \"beer for girls,\" according to its label.\nWhile the news has had a mixed reaction, BrewDog will be donating 20 percent of proceeds to two women's charities and called the launch \"a send-up of the lazy marketing efforts targeting the female market,\" in an online statement.\nThe Economist – Celebrating Inspiring Women The Economist The Economist has launched a campaign called Celebrating Inspiring Women for International Women's Day 2018 Only about 30 percent of The Economist's 1.4 million print and digital subscribers are women and the publisher wants to change this.\nIt has created an online hub featuring interviews with women such as Zaha Hadid, Maye Musk (mother of Elon Musk) and activist Betty Friedan, which is being promoted by an outdoor ad campaign in the U.K. launching Thursday.\nThe campaign is part of a broader initiative to grow its \"globally curious\" target audience, which has an even gender split.\nNike – Until We All Win Nike Serena Williams, who stars in a Nike advert on International Women's Day 2018 \"I've never been the right kind of woman,\" states Serena Williams in Nike 's ad recognizing International Women's Day. \"Over-sized and over-confident, too mean if I don't smile, too black for my tennis whites,\" she continues.\nThere's no wrong way to be a woman is the ad's message, and the sportswear giant is calling for people to donate to charity Girls Inc.\nJohnnie Walker – Jane Walker Diageo Drinks-maker Diageo has rebranded some bottles of Johnnie Walker as Jane Walker Bottles of some Johnnie Walker Scotch whisky looked a little different from March 1, with the brand's famous striding man being replaced by a woman, Jane Walker .\nJohnnie Walker Black Label Jane Walker Edition bottles will be available in the U.S. for $34, with maker Diageo donating $1 from each bottle sold to organizations championing women's causes.\nUber – Driven Women Take The Wheel Uber Uber is running a film celebrating International Women's Day in Asia-Pacific countries Uber has released a three-minute film attempting to get rid of the stereotype that women can't drive, featuring female drivers from Asian countries. It is running on the brand's YouTube channels in countries including Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan.\nHP - Paro HP HP has made a short film starring schoolgirl Paro for International Women's Day The tech company has launched a short film starring Indian girl Paro, who writes stories in a notebook instead of listening to her high school teacher. The teacher bans her notebook, but is inspired by her story and ends up making it into a bound book (on an HP laptop). The film kicks off a seven-month competition with education charity Girl Rising, aiming to find people who are advocating for equality around the world.\nshow chapters What does equal pay mean for the economy? 9 Hours Ago | 03:50",
