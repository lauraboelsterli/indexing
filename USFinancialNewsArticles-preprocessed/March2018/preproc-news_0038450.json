It is the first job for the 50-year-old since he quit as Springboks coach after the 2015 Rugby World Cup, where South Africa finished third. “It’s a great honour for me to join a club with such a rich heritage. I can not wait to get involved at Stade Francais. The mission is ambitious. I cannot do it alone. So I am very happy to team up with the players and all the important players of the club,” he told the club’s website (stade.fr). Reporting by Mark Gleeson in Cape Town; Editing by Ian Ransom",
