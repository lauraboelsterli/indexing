    "text": "0 COMMENTS SOME CARS spend their lives waiting to be a hero. The average Lamborghini can go 200 mph but most of the time it just sits there in the garage, reeking depreciation. But on that one special night when you have to get your pregnant wife, or girlfriend, or both, to the ospedale in a hurry, the Lambo stands up like a boss.\nThose lift-kit pickups belching diesel smoke and whomping down the highway on 36-inch beadlocks? Useless. But when Houston flooded, hundreds of those explicitly stupid vehicles suddenly looked brilliant, wading filthy waters to rescue stranded residents.\nThese machines are like the Incredibles, superheroes forced to lead humdrum lives. And none more so than the Jeep Wrangler. Particularly in Rubicon trim, this thing will climb a tree: front and rear Dana 44 axles with electronic locking differentials; 33-inch mudders on 17-inch alloys; push-button sway-bar disconnect (to improve front wheel articulation in uneven terrain); and all powered by a 3.6-liter, 285-hp V6 and eight-speed automatic. But as it is a $50,000 vehicle, as tested, buyers would be understandably reluctant to bash it about in the big piney.\nThen two weeks ago, on a dark, icy road in suburban Detroit, a Jeep Wrangler got a chance to show its mettle. As reported by C.J. Carnacchio of The Oxford Leader, God bless them: Early Sunday Fiat Chrysler Automobiles ’ head of design Ralph Gilles and his wife, Doris, were driving home in a new Wrangler when they came upon an accident scene, a head-on collision between a man in a Ford Edge and a couple in a Ford Fiesta. \nThe driver of the Edge was able to exit the car but the couple in the Fiesta were trapped in twisted wreckage (the woman passenger later died of her injuries). Then out of the dark a woman driving a Buick LeSabre plowed into the Fiesta, slamming it into the Edge, which began to burn.\nAlarmed that the fire might spread to the car with the couple trapped inside, Mr. Gilles jumped in his Wrangler Sahara, slammed it into 4x4 High, and pushed the burning vehicle across the road.\n“I still have no idea where that [thought] came from,” Gilles told the Michigan paper. “The only thing I can remember thinking [is] I’ve got a Jeep, it’s got a bumper on it, I think I can do this.”\nThis story makes my heart sing. First, because Ralph and Doris Gilles are good people and we need those more than ever. I hope they are OK. Anyone who has ever been first on the scene of a fatal accident knows how upsetting it is.\n‘ We tried to bury the Rubicon in a gravel pit. It was not impressed with our feeble efforts. It just kept churning. ’ \n\nSecond, because finally, for once, a Jeep Wrangler was the right tool in the right place at the right time and actually did something useful, not just taking Biff and Molly to the prom.\nI get it. The Wrangler is what’s known in the industry as a lifestyle vehicle, in most cases reflecting the lifestyle the driver would like to have if he or she were not working. Does it even matter that the Wrangler is even more ridiculously able than before? \nThe rundown: This the fourth generation of the Jeep’s beloved rockhopper, built in the brand’s ancestral home of Toledo, Ohio. The new Wrangler shares no body panels with the previous, but to say the styling has evolved would be wildly overstating it. The windshield angle is a bit less upright and the windshield frame itself folds down. The doors, hood and most of the body panels are now aluminum. Our Rubicon was bracketed by the optional heavy steel bumpers fit with tow hooks and removable end caps. \nThe U.S. engine options are three: a 2.0-liter turbocharged direct-injection four cylinder (270 hp/295 pound-feet); the 3.6-liter V6 (285/260); and, coming next year to four-door Wrangler models, a 3.0-liter turbodiesel (260/442). All engines are available with the eight-speed automatic; the 3.6-liter can be paired with a six-speed manual.\nThe top-spec Rubicon is a high-tech tractor underneath: Its Rock-Trac 4x4 system comprises a two-speed transfer case with a mighty 4:1 gear ratio; and front and rear locking diffs, engaged by a paddle switch in cabin. The vehicle’s belly is up-armored with four skid plates and rock rails. With the eight-speed automatic, the crawl ratio is a slow motion-like 77:1.\nMy friend Ezra Dyer and I took Ruby to some pine barrens near Fort Bragg, N.C., where we tried to bury it in a gravel pit and then nearly rolled it down a hill. The Jeep was not impressed with our feeble efforts. It just kept churning.\nFor as strong as the Rubicon is off road, the fourth-gen redesign emphasized on-road refinement, particularly reducing noise levels in its historically loud cabin, beset with drumming from the knobby tires and the indignant howl of wind around the its boxy corners. \nThe cabin noise in our two-door Rubicon did seem more subdued than in the last example I drove. The V6 and eight-speed automatic are barely heard. But on the highway the drone of those mud-and-snow tires finds its way through the floorboards and right into the fillings in my back teeth. Our tester included a nine-speaker Alpine sound system, which was just loud enough to overtop the tires.\nThe engineers also did what they could to improve the Jeep’s on-road ride and handling, tuning and fettling the five-link front and rear suspension to better constrain the Jeep’s sometimes unnerving body roll. The steering ratio of 17.4:1, or 3.6 turns lock-to-lock, makes it hard to do anything suddenly, of course. The body control is better, I suppose, but the Rubicon’s bouncy and pneumatic tires are pretty hopeless. Pilates balls aren’t this wobbly.\nOh well. You can’t be a hero all the time.\n2018 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon 4x4 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon Photo: FCA US LLC \nBase Price: $38,190 Price, as Tested: $49,570 Powertrain: 3.6-liter direct-injection DOHC V6; eight-speed automatic transmission; full-time four-wheel drive with two-speed transfer case; front and rear locking differentials.
