    "text": "(Reuters) - The jackpot for the Mega Millions lottery climbed to $521 million, but no winner was immediately announced early on Saturday for a pot that surpassed the half-billion-dollar mark for the fourth time in the game’s history, the lottery said.\nA ticket is seen ahead of the Mega Millions lottery draw which reached a jackpot of $415 Million in Manhattan, New York, U.S., July 1, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo The winning numbers drawn on Friday night were 11, 28, 31, 46, and 59 with a “mega Ball” of 1.\nThe drawing follows a March 27 Mega Millions drawing that was the twenty-third in a row without a jackpot-winning ticket.\nThe grand prize has rolled higher since it was last won on Jan. 5 at $451 million by a 20-year-old Florida man, the lottery said.\nFriday’s 11 pm ET (0300 GMT) jackpot drawing was for the tenth largest prize ever offered in the United States. Powerball holds the record with a $1.586 billion payout in 2016.\nThe Mega Millions record is $656 million won in 2012.\nReporting By Andrew Hay; Additional reporting by Rich McKay; Editing by Michael Perry and Tom Hogue\n ",
