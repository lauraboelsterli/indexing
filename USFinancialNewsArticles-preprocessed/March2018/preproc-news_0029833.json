    "text": "Bobby Portis and Zach LaVine each had 21 points and Lauri Markkanen added 19 points as the Chicago Bulls had seven players in double figures in a 129-122 win over the host Atlanta Hawks on Sunday afternoon at Philips Arena in Atlanta.\nTaurean Prince had a career-high 38 points and Mike Muscala added 19 points to lead the Hawks, who lost for the fourth time in five games.\nChicago rebounded from a brutal first quarter to win for the third time in five games after losing five straight. The Bulls topped 110 points for just the fourth time in the last 19 games.\nAtlanta claimed a 34-20 lead after one quarter, but the Bulls roared back in the second, outscoring the Hawks 33-16, as Chicago built a 53-50 halftime lead.\nThe Bulls led by as much as 12 in the second half before Atlanta made it close late, cutting the lead to three before the Bulls made 9 of 10 free throws in the final minute to ice the game.\nThe Bulls won primarily by taking care of the ball — they had just five turnovers as a team — as both teams shot well (49 percent from field-goal range and 45.9 percent from 3-point range for Chicago, 51.2 percent and 47.5 percent for the Hawks). The rebounding battle was also close as Chicago won 47-42.\nAntonio Blakeney had 14 points off the bench and Denzel Valentine added 12 as Chicago’s reserves outscored Atlanta’s, 62-46. Bulls guard Kris Dunn also added 13 points.\nJohn Collins had 15 points for Atlanta and Isaiah Taylor added seven points and a team-high eight assists for the Hawks, who had 32 assists as a team. Dewayne Dedmon added 10 points and nine rebounds for Atlanta.\nChicago returns home for a Tuesday matchup against the Los Angeles Clippers before heading back on the road on Thursday at Memphis.\nAtlanta stays home for the second game of a three-game homestand with a Tuesday night matchup against Oklahoma City before hosting the Charlotte Hornets on Thursday.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
