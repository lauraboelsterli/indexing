Soccer Football - Premier League - AFC Bournemouth vs West Bromwich Albion - Vitality Stadium, Bournemouth, Britain - March 17, 2018 West Bromwich Albion manager Alan Pardew Action Images via Reuters/Tony O'Brien \nWest Brom are bottom of the table with 20 points after three wins, 11 draws and 17 defeats and are desperate for wins in the remaining seven games to salvage a dismal season. \nPardew, who replaced the sacked Tony Pulis in November, has not fared better than his predecessor but is keen to make amends next season. \n“Since I’ve come here I feel a bit like I owe this football club,” Pardew told reporters ahead of Saturday’s Premier League match against seventh-placed Burnley. \n“The results since I’ve been here should have been better and I’d like to come back next season with a squad that better reflects the way I play, with a bit more attacking prowess.” \nWest Brom have won one league game under the 56-year-old Pardew and problems off the pitch have not helped. \nThe club sacked chairman John Williams and chief executive Martin Goodman last month shortly before four players were interviewed by Spanish police over the alleged theft of a taxi during a warm-weather training camp in Barcelona. \nPardew said West Brom had to put their troubles behind them and look to first end a run of seven straight league defeats. \n“We are focusing on one game at a time and getting a win against Burnley on Saturday. That’s as simplistic as I’ve put it to the group,” Pardew added. Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru, editing by Ed Osmond",
