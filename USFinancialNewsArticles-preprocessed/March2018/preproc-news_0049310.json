    "text": "SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Bank of China Ltd (BoC) ( 601988.SS ) ( 3988.HK ), the country’s fourth-largest lender by assets, reported a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly profit, helped by rising interest income and falling operating expenses.\nA Bank of China logo is seen at the SIBOS banking and financial conference in Toronto, Ontario, Canada October 19, 2017. Picture taken October 19, 2017. REUTERS/Chris Helgren Profit reached 26.9 billion yuan ($4.28 billion) for the quarter ended December, down 10 percent from 29.8 billion yuan a year ago. This was, however, better than an average estimate of 25.51 billion yuan from 18 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.\nFor 2017, net profit rose about 5 percent to 172.41 billion yuan from 164.578 billion yuan a year ago.\nBoC’s non-performing loan ratio was 1.45 percent as at end-December, from 1.41 percent at end-September.\nIts operating expenses fell 0.69 percent from a year ago to 173.86 billion yuan in 2017, while net interest income rose 10.57 percent to 338.39 billion yuan over the period.\nBoC’s net interest margins (NIM) - the difference between interest paid and earned by banks - was reported at 1.84 percent for 2017, versus 1.83 percent for the year ago.\n($1 = 6.2888 Chinese yuan)\nReporting by Engen Tham in SHANGHAI and Matthew Miller in BEIJING; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ",
