Likely it's these four secrets to a secure retirement:\n1. Invest for the long term Markets fluctuate, but that doesn't necessarily mean you need to change course.\nThe best thing retirement savers can do is stick with a long-term strategy designed to weather all market conditions — up and down.\nTo that end, be consistent and commit to a plan based on your personal goals ( and geography ).\n2. Maintain a diversified portfolio Achieving your long-term goals requires balancing risk and rewards along with choosing the right mix of investments.\nA variety of investments can help secure guaranteed income and growth while lowering the risk of losses during market downturns. That means owning funds instead of individual stocks, and owning multiple asset classes instead of just one.\nThis is where working with an advisor can help.\n3. Keep a close eye on fees At the same time, understand the fees you are paying for your investments and for your financial advisor.\nEven the difference between 1 percent and 2 percent can have a dramatic impact on your retirement. Therefore, consider low cost, simple investments that you buy and hold.\nWarren Buffett 's pick? In an interview with CNBC's \"On The Money ,\" the Oracle of Omaha recommended an S&P 500 low-cost index fund.\nBuffett said investors can keep more of their retirement savings by cutting investment costs and reducing management fees or commissions charged by financial advisors.\nTo see if you are paying too much for the advisory services you receive, click here . \n4. Start saving early Stashing a portion of your monthly income toward retirement when you are young — and contributing throughout your career — is a major component of financial security. Yet, fewer than 1 in 5 boomers said they started saving when they were in their 20s, according to the Capital Group survey.\nFidelity suggests that workers every year put away 15 percent of their salary , which includes any employer match they receive. That number isn't attainable for everyone, however. (The median savings rate in a retirement plan is now just shy of 9 percent, the highest percentage in almost 10 years, according to Fidelity.)\nTo work your way up, Jeanne Thompson, a senior vice president of Fidelity Investments, suggests incremental changes. \"Increase your savings 1 percent every year to a target of 15 percent.\"\nThe key is to make sure you have enough time for your savings and market returns to grow.\nMore from Retire Well: \nThe new retirement: Working \nHere are some steps to clean up your financial clutter \nA retirement hack millennials will love",
