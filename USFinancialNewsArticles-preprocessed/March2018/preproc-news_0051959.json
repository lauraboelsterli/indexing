    "text": "BUENOS AIRES, March 27 (Reuters) - Argentina’s central bank sold $158.9 million in the spot currency market on Tuesday, it said in a statement, marking its thirteenth intervention this month as part of its effort to halt the local peso currency’s depreciation against the U.S. dollar.\nThe central bank has sold $1.925 billion in March to support the Argentine peso, warning that its depreciation could harm efforts to slow the pace of inflation.
