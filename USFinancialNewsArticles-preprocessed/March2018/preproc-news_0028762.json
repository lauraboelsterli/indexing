    "text": "1 COMMENTS Leading up to its initial public offering, Dropbox Inc. executives have spent the past few days pitching potential investors on the company’s ability to reach an expansive, 500 million-user base and its growth potential, according to people who have attended the meetings.\nOn Wednesday as part of the company’s so-called roadshow to peddle its IPO, Dropbox’s Chief Executive Drew Houston, Chief Financial Officer Ajay Vashee and Chief Operating Officer Dennis Woodside addressed about 200 investors who crowded into a ballroom at the Lotte New York Palace Hotel in Manhattan.\nThe executives touted Dropbox’s potential for accelerating growth and its likelihood of turning a profit, seeking to portray the company as one less dependent on an active sales force and instead a service that tends to sell itself to users who become advocates, according to people who attended the meetings.\nMore in IPOs\nDeutsche Asset-Management IPO Values Unit at Up to $8.9 Billion March 12, 2018 Chinese Smartphone Maker Xiaomi Weighs Listing in Mainland and Hong Kong March 1, 2018 Spotify Kicks Off Its Unusual IPO February 28, 2018 Dropbox Files for Its Initial Public Offering February 23, 2018 Dropbox’s IPO is slated to be the largest U.S. technology debut since Snap Inc. went public in 2017, based on its expected valuation of between $7 billion and $8 billion . Dropbox’s IPO price—and its early days of trading—will be closely watched for signs of whether more highly valued tech companies could be enticed to tap public markets instead of remaining in the well-capitalized private markets.\nThrough Tuesday, just three technology IPOs had listed in the U.S. so far this year, raising $2.7 billion, according to Dealogic. These companies’ shares are trading up 27% on average, Dealogic data show.\nSeveral potential Dropbox investors said the scarcity of technology IPOs is helping boost interest in Dropbox’s debut as a rare, high-growth tech company with a sustainable business model.\nSome potential investors said the company’s current price target of $16 to $18 a share is conservative and they think it could be raised before the company starts trading next week on the Nasdaq. The Dropbox IPO will seek to raise $612 million at the midpoint of its range, and the company said it would receive proceeds of $529.7 million at that midpoint.\nStill, Dropbox’s current expected price range sets it far below the $10 billion valuation where the company had raised private capital in 2014.\nPricing can change up until the night before a company starts trading. Dropbox and its underwriters, which include Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., will set a final IPO price based on feedback from investors over the next week.\nMr. Houston and others spelled out the use case for Dropbox as a collaboration tool for businesses and consumers rather than simply a web-storage company. In an investor video released ahead of the roadshow, Mr. Houston highlighted the company’s evolution: “We’ve realized the most important thing to our users wasn’t the storage. It’s the sharing, the collaboration.”\nWhether investors are willing to accept that broader concept of Dropbox’s business likely will be a key to how the company prices and trades and a key consideration for investors as they decide how to value the business.\nWrite to Maureen Farrell at maureen.farrell@wsj.com",
