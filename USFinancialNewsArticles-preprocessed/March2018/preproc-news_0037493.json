    "text": "WOOD DALE, Ill., Power Solutions International, Inc. (\"the Company\") (OTC Pink:PSIX), a leader in the design, engineering and manufacture of emissions-certified, alternative-fuel power systems, announced that the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has appointed BDO USA, LLP (“BDO”) as PSI’s new independent registered public accounting firm to succeed Frazier & Deeter, LLC (\"Frazier & Deeter\"). The decision to appoint BDO was not the result of any disagreement between PSI and Frazier & Deeter on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure.\nJohn Miller, chief executive officer and president, commented, “We’ve made significant progress on the restatement since Frazier & Deeter’s appointment as our auditors. Also, during this time we’ve assembled a strong internal team dedicated to this effort. With the addition of BDO’s substantial resources, local presence in Chicago and highly seasoned restatement team, we believe that we will be in a position to complete our restatement of the affected prior period financial statements and concurrently complete our delinquent filings for the 2016 and 2017 periods by the end of the third quarter of 2018.”\nAbout Power Solutions International, Inc.\nPower Solutions International, Inc.

These forward-looking statements are covered by the “Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements” provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Company has tried to identify these forward-looking statements by using words such as “expect,” “contemplate,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “plan,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “forecast,” “budgeted,” “believe,” “outlook,” “guidance,” “projection,” “target” or similar expressions, but these words are not the exclusive means for identifying such statements. The Company cautions that a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation: the final results of the Audit Committee’s independent review as it impacts the Company’s accounting, accounting policies and internal control over financial reporting; management’s ability to successfully implement the Audit Committee’s remedial recommendations; the reasons giving rise to the prior resignation of RSM US LLP as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm; the time and effort required to complete the restatement of the affected financial statements, complete its delinquent financial statements and amend or prepare the related Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings, particularly within the current anticipated timeline; the subsequent discovery of additional adjustments to the Company’s previously issued financial statements; the timing of completion of necessary re-audits, interim reviews and audits by the new independent registered public accounting firm; the timing of completion of steps to address, and the inability to address and remedy, material weaknesses; the identification of additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies; variances in non-recurring expenses; risks relating to the substantial costs and diversion of personnel’s attention and resources deployed to address the financial reporting and internal control matters and related class action litigation; the ability of the Company to accurately budget for and forecast product shipments, and the extent to which product shipments result in recorded revenues; the impact of the resignation of the Company’s former independent registered public accounting firm, RSM US LLP, on the Company’s relationship with its lender and trade creditors and the potential for defaults and exercise of creditor remedies; the impact of the previously disclosed investigation initiated by the SEC and any related or additional governmental investigative or enforcement proceedings; the impact of resignations of the Company’s directors and certain executive officers and any delays and challenges encountered in recruiting replacements for open positions and the replacements’ transitions into their positions; and any negative impacts from delisting of the Company’s common stock from Nasdaq and any delays and challenges in obtaining a re-listing on a stock exchange. Actual events or results may differ materially from the Company’s expectations. The Company’s forward-looking statements are presented as of the date hereof. Except as required by law, the Company expressly disclaims any intention or obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nContact:\nPower Solutions International, Inc.\nPhilip Kranz\nDirector of Investor Relations\n+1 (630) 451-5402\nPhilip.Kranz@psiengines.com\nSource:Power Solutions International, Inc.",
