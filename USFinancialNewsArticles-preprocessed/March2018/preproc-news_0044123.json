    "text": "STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Failure to reach a backstop deal for the border between the Irish Republic and British-ruled Northern Ireland by June could put the UK’s final withdrawal agreement from the European Union at risk, Ireland’s deputy prime minister said on Monday.\n“We have to try to get a withdrawal agreement and a withdrawal treaty signed off on before October, and I think on that particular issue Ireland has a very specific issue ... and that’s the Irish border issue,” Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said during a visit to Sweden.\n“Hopefully we can have that done by June, but if we don’t have it done by June, then I think obviously, we have to raise some serious questions as to whether it is possible to finalize a withdrawal treaty at all.”\nReporting by Simon Johnson; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ",
