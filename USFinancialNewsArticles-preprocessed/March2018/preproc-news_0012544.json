    "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., March 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Nuverra Environmental Solutions, Inc. (NYSE American: NES) (\"Nuverra\" or the \"Company\") today announced financial and operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nSUMMARY OF FINANCIAL RESULTS\nFourth quarter revenue was $46.4 million, an increase of approximately 29.8%, or $10.6 million, when compared with $35.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss for the fourth quarter was $30.9 million, a reduction of $30.4 million, or approximately 49.6%, when compared with a net loss of $61.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Loss from continuing operations, adjusted for special items, for the fourth quarter was $17.3 million, compared with $26.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $5.1 million, an increase of $2.6 million compared with $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter Adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 400 basis points. Total liquidity as of December 31, 2017 was $20.5 million.\n\"Nuverra was well positioned to capitalize on an improved operating environment in the second half of 2017,\" said Ed Lang, Chief Financial Officer. \"We exited the year with strong financial results, including double digit topline growth and expanding margins. The industry momentum is continuing in 2018 and we are seeing increased drilling activity in all basins which we service. With our attractive asset base and improved liquidity position, we are investing to further improve and grow our business platform and expect to deliver another year of favorable results in 2018.\"\nFOURTH QUARTER 2017 RESULTS\nFourth quarter revenue was $46.4 million, an increase of $10.6 million, or 29.8%, from $35.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Approximately 10.2% of the increase in revenue is attributable to pricing increases, while 19.6% is a result of increases in activities.\nAs a result of increased activity and a change in depreciation related to the application of fresh start accounting upon emergence from chapter 11, total costs and expenses, adjusted for special items, were $62.3 million, a 29.8% increase compared with $48.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nNet loss for the fourth quarter was $30.9 million, a reduction of $30.4 million when compared with a net loss of $61.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. For the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company reported a net loss from continuing operations, adjusted for special items, of $17.3 million. Special items in the fourth quarter primarily included the loss on the sale of underutilized assets, non-recurring legal and professional fees, stock-based compensation expense, as well as $2.5 million in long-lived asset impairment charges for assets held for sale in the Rocky Mountain division. This compares with a loss from continuing operations, adjusted for special items, of $26.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $5.1 million, an increase of $2.6 million compared with $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations was 11.1%, compared with 7.1% in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nFULL YEAR 2017 RESULTS\nRevenue for the year was $176.1 million, an increase of $23.9 million, or 15.7%, when compared with $152.2 million for 2016. Due to oil prices becoming more stable in 2017, customer demand for our services increased in all divisions in which we operate as compared to the same period in the prior year. Approximately 3.9% of the increase in revenue is attributable to pricing increases, while 11.8% is a result of increases in activities.\nAs a result of the application of fresh start accounting upon emergence from chapter 11, net income for the full year was $120.7 million, compared to a net loss of $168.9 million in the prior year. Net loss from continuing operations for the year, adjusted for special items, was $79.6 million, compared with a loss of $108.0 million for 2016. Year-to-date special items primarily included $218.0 million of capital reorganization costs incurred in connection with the application of fresh start accounting and after emergence from chapter 11 recorded to \"Reorganization items, net.\" Additionally, special items included the loss on the sale of underutilized assets, stock-based compensation expense, a $4.3 million gain on the change in fair value of the derivative warrant liability, and $4.9 million in long-lived asset impairment charges for assets held for sale in the Rocky Mountain and Southern divisions.\nAdjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the full year was $13.3 million, an increase of 70.0% when compared with 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations for 2017 was 7.6%, compared with 5.2% in 2016.\nCASH FLOW AND LIQUIDITY\nNet cash used in operating activities from continuing operations for the full year ended December 31, 2017 was $25.4 million, while asset sales net of capital expenditures from continuing operations provided proceeds of $1.7 million.\nTotal liquidity as of December 31, 2017, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, available borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility and a delayed draw available on our second lien term loan facility, was $20.5 million. As of December 31, 2017, total debt outstanding was $39.1 million, consisting of $14.3 million under our senior secured term loan facility, $21.0 million under our second lien term loan facility, and $3.8 million of capital leases for vehicle financings.\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION\nAs previously disclosed, the Company emerged from chapter 11 bankruptcy on August 7, 2017, or the \"Effective Date,\" and elected to apply fresh start accounting as of July 31, 2017 to coincide with the timing of the normal accounting period close. References to \"Successor\" relate to the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to July 31, 2017, while references to \"Predecessor\" refer to the financial position and results of operations of the Company on and prior to July 31, 2017. The Successor and Predecessor GAAP results for the applicable periods are presented in the tables following this release.\nFor discussion purposes, the Company has combined the Successor and Predecessor periods to derive combined results for the year ended December 31, 2017. However, because of various adjustments to the condensed consolidated financial statements in connection with the application of fresh start accounting, the results of operations for the Successor period are not comparable to those of the Predecessor period. The Company believes that, subject to consideration of the impact of fresh start accounting, combining the results of the Successor and Predecessor periods provides meaningful information about the financial results of the Company, including revenues and costs that assist a reader in understanding the financial results for the applicable periods.\nAbout Nuverra\nNuverra Environmental Solutions, Inc. is among the largest companies in the United States dedicated to providing comprehensive, full-cycle environmental solutions to customers in the energy market.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS\n(In thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nThis press release contains non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts, that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the statements of operations or balance sheets of the Company; or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the attached financial tables.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are provided because management of the Company uses these financial measures in evaluating the Company's ongoing financial results and trends. Management uses this non-GAAP information as an indicator of business results, and evaluates overall performance with respect to such indicators. Management believes that excluding items such as acquisition expenses, amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, asset impairments, restructuring charges, expenses related to litigation and resolution of lawsuits, and other charges, which may or may not be non-recurring, among other items that are inconsistent in amount and frequency (as with acquisition expenses), or determined pursuant to complex formulas that incorporate factors, such as market volatility, that are beyond our control (as with stock-based compensation), for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of the Company's current operating performance and comparisons to the past and future operating performance. The Company believes that providing non-GAAP financial measures such as EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income (loss), and adjusted net income (loss) per share, in addition to related GAAP financial measures, provides investors with greater transparency to the information used by the Company's management. These non-GAAP financial measures are not substitutes for measures of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not necessarily be indicative of the Company's liquidity or ability to fund cash needs. Not all companies calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner, and our presentation may not be comparable to the presentations of other companies.\nFor illustrative purposes, the Company has combined the Successor and Predecessor periods to derive combined results for the year ended December 31, 2017 for these non-GAAP reconciliations. The combination was generated by addition of comparable financial statement line item captions. However, because of various adjustments to the condensed consolidated financial statements in connection with the application of fresh start accounting, including asset valuation adjustments and liability adjustments, the results of operations for the Successor period are not comparable to those of the Predecessor period.
