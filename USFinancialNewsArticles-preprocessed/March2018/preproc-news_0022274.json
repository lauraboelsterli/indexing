    "text": "KIEV (Reuters) - A Ukrainian who negotiated the exchange of prisoners in the eastern conflict zone was placed under court-ordered detention on Friday on suspicion of preparing “terrorist acts”, after he was caught transporting weapons into Ukraine-held territory.\nMember of Ukrainian parliament Nadiya Savchenko (R) speaks with Volodymyr (Vladimir) Ruban, head of Officer Corps centre, dealing with prisoners of war exchange in eastern Ukraine, as they attend a court hearing in Kiev, Ukraine March 9, 2018. REUTERS/Serhii Nuzhnenko The flow of illegal weapons is one of the issues Kiev is grappling with as a result of its nearly four-year conflict with pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, in which more than 10,000 people have been killed and around 1 million displaced.\nVolodymyr Ruban was apprehended on Thursday at a frontline checkpoint with a collection of weapons, including machine guns and explosives, the State Security Service (SBU) said, adding that it had been tracking his activities for some time.\nSlideshow (3 Images) In a meeting with the head of the SBU, President Petro Poroshenko said Ruban was part of a criminal network that had planned to destabilize Ukraine through violent attacks.\n“Large-scale terrorist acts were being prepared in Ukraine,” Poroshenko said.\nRuban, who is the head of a non-governmental organization that has organized swaps of Ukrainian troops and Russia-backed separatists, could not be reached for comment.\nA Kiev district court ordered that he be detained for two months while the case is further investigated.\nReporting by Alessandra Prentice; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ",
