The Nasdaq Composite held on to a 1.3 percent gain.\nFacebook lost $75 billion in stock market value last week, following the outcry over its handling of users’ data. Facebook shares were up marginally in premarket trading.\nMicrosoft rose nearly 3 percent after Morgan Stanley hiked its price target on the stock by $20 to $130, saying the company could hit $1 trillion in market value with growing public adoption of the cloud and improving margins.\nIntel gained more than 2 percent after brokerage Raymond James raised the stock to “market perform”.\nFederal Reserve’s New York chief William Dudley and his Cleveland counterpart, Loretta Mester, are scheduled to speak later in the day. Both of them are voters on the rate-setting committee this year. (Reporting by Sruthi Shankar in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D’Silva)\n ",
