(NASDAQ: AGEN), an immuno-oncology company with a pipeline of immune checkpoint antibodies and cancer vaccines, provided a corporate update and reported financial results for fourth quarter and full year 2017.\n\"Innovation and speed are key drivers of success in I-O. With our current capabilities and our extensive portfolio of novel I-O approaches, we have positioned Agenus to develop combination treatments for more patients and more cancers. Our ability to rapidly advance clinical trials with our CTLA-4 (AGEN1884) and Keytruda as well as trials using our own proprietary combinations with AGEN1884 and PD-1 (AGEN2034) could lead to our BLA filing as soon as the end of 2019. We recently produced commercial grade CTLA-4 to assure our commercial readiness,\" said Garo H. Armen, Ph.D., Chairman and CEO of Agenus. \"This year, we will also file several INDs for our novel I-O antibodies including first/best-in-class bispecific tumor microenvironment conditioning agents.\"\nMilestones Achieved:\nClinical Trials Launched phase 2 trial with the combination of AGEN1884 with Keytruda in patients with 1L NSCLC and over 50% PD-L1 expression Completed dose escalation trials for AGEN1884 (anti-CTLA-4) and AGEN2034 (anti-PD-1) Launched a phase 2 trial with the combination of our proprietary CTLA-4 (AGEN1884) and PD-1 (AGEN2034), identified optimal dose, and expanded trial into relapsed/refractory cervical cancer Reported initial safety and immunogenicity of our neoantigen vaccine AutoSynVax; combination trials with our checkpoint antibodies are planned. Pipeline - first and/or best-in-class monospecific and bispecific antibodies Developed our novel next generation CTLA-4 – IND filing expected in 2018. Developed molecules and initiated IND preparations for our first/best in class bispecific antibodies designed to condition the tumor microenvironment through regulatory T cell depletion and other undisclosed mechanisms; IND filings expected in 2018 Launched AgenTus Therapeutics, our cell therapy subsidiary Appointed Bruno Lucidi as CEO of AgenTus, advanced our pipeline including our proprietary allogeneic format and our proprietary phosphorylated targets.
