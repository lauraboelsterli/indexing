    "text": "HOLLISTON, Mass., Harvard Bioscience, Inc. (Nasdaq:HBIO) (the “Company”), a global developer, manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of solutions to advance life science, reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\n“With our third consecutive quarter of top line organic growth and our recent acquisition of Data Sciences International, we enter 2018 with enthusiasm for the year ahead,” said Jeffrey Duchemin, President and CEO of Harvard Bioscience. “Our product lines in electrophysiology continued the trend from earlier quarters and produced solid results, remaining one of our most important competitive strengths. The results we announced today stem from our commitment to and execution against our corporate strategy. Full year 2017 ended with top line and operational results trending upward and we expect this to accelerate with the acquisition of Data Sciences International and the sale of Denville Scientific in the first quarter of 2018. We are confident that the continuing transformation of Harvard Bioscience into a pure play life science instrumentation company, with a more innovative product portfolio and less reliance on academic research funding, will bode well for our company and generate accelerated top line and bottom line growth.”\nFourth Quarter Reported Results\nRevenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 were $27.5 million, an increase of approximately $1.0 million, or 4%, compared to revenues of $26.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The disposition of AHN Biotechnologie GmbH (“AHN”) in October 2016 resulted in a $0.2 million decrease in revenues in the quarter, while the impact of currency translation positively impacted revenues in the quarter by approximately $0.8 million. Excluding the impact of the AHN disposition and currency translation, organic revenues grew approximately 1.6%, or $0.4 million in the fourth quarter. Additionally, Denville contributed approximately $5.8 million and $6.0 million in revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. On a pro forma basis, organic revenue, excluding Denville, would have grown approximately 2.3%, or $0.6 million in the fourth quarter. For a reconciliation of changes in revenues, refer to Exhibit 9 below.\nFor pro forma purposes, Data Sciences International, Inc. (“DSI”) recorded revenues of approximately $11 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nNet income, as measured under GAAP, was $1 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $1.3 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, for the same quarter in 2016.\nNet income, on a non-GAAP basis, was $1.7 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1.3 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, for the three months ended December 31, 2016. For a reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP net income, and between the GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, refer to Exhibits 6 and 7 below, respectively.\nFull Year Reported Results\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $101.9 million, a decrease of approximately $2.6 million, or 3%, compared to revenues of $104.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The disposition of AHN in October 2016 resulted in a $2.1 million decrease in revenues in 2017, while the impact of currency translation negatively impacted 2017 revenues by approximately $0.3 million. Excluding the impact of the AHN disposition and currency translation, organic revenues declined approximately $0.3 million, or 0.2%. Additionally, Denville contributed approximately $24.5 million and $25.3 million in revenues for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. On a pro forma basis, organic revenue, excluding Denville, would have grown approximately 0.5%, or $0.6 million, in 2017. For a reconciliation of changes in revenues, refer to Exhibit 9 below.\nFor pro forma purposes, DSI recorded revenues of approximately $44 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2017.\nNet loss, as measured under GAAP, was $0.9 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $4.3 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet income, on a non-GAAP basis, was $4.2 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $5.0 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. For a reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP net income, and between the GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, refer to Exhibits 6 and 7 below, respectively.\nFinancial Guidance for 2018\nHarvard Bioscience is reaffirming its financial guidance for the full year 2018, which was previously issued on January 22, 2018. The Company continues to expect 2018 revenues to be between $118 million and $123 million.\nThe Company continues to expect to report a full-year 2018 GAAP diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.03 to $0.07 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of approximately $0.19 to $0.23.\nThe Company may incur charges, realize gains, or experience other events in 2018 that could cause actual results to vary from this guidance. Refer to Exhibit 8 below for a reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance.\nConference Call Details\nHarvard Bioscience will be hosting a conference call and webcast today at 4:30 pm ET.
