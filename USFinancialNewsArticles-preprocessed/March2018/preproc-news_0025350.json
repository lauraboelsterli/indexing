    "text": "SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Heritage Global Inc. (OTCQB:HGBL, CSE:HGP) (“Heritage Global,” “HGI” or “the Company”), a value-driven, innovative leader in corporate and financial asset liquidation transactions, valuations and advisory services, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2017 as summarized below.\n($ in thousands, except per share amounts) Quarter Ended December 31,\nTwelve Months Ended December 31,\n2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenue Services revenue (1) $ 5,300 $ 3,653 $ 17,937 $ 15,371 Asset sales (2) 277 2,217 2,192 8,462 Total revenue 5,577 5,870 20,129 23,833 Gross profit 4,696 3,782 15,416 12,515 Operating (loss) income (372 ) 634 364 190 Net (loss) income (387 ) (299 ) (249 ) 14 Net (loss) income per share – basic and diluted $ (0.01 ) $ (0.01 ) $ (0.01 ) $ 0.00 (Non-GAAP Financial Measures) (3) EBITDA $ (694 ) $ (282 ) $ (261 ) $ 414 Adjusted EBITDA $ 909 $ 738 $ 2,065 $ 605 (1)\nServices revenue represents revenue generated from activities in which Heritage Global acted as an agent by either brokering a transaction or providing some other fee-based service.\n(2)\nAsset sales represent revenue generated from activities in which Heritage Global acted in a principal capacity, reselling assets that it had purchased.\n(3)\nDefinitions and disclosures regarding non-GAAP financial information including reconciliations are included at the end of the press release.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Summary of Financial Results:\nTotal revenue in the fourth quarter declined 5%, from $5.9 million to $5.6 million. However, the decrease in total revenue was due to a $1.9 million, or 88%, decline in asset sales revenue versus the prior year, with the absence of several large asset sales in 2017 being mostly offset by a $1.6 million, or 45%, year-over-year increase in higher-margin services revenue. Gross profit, or total revenue net of costs of revenue, increased 24% to $4.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $3.8 million in the fourth quarter level of 2016, due principally to higher margin services revenue and the timing and magnitude of certain asset liquidation transactions together resulting in a $1.2 million, or 58%, reduction in the cost of total revenue. During the fourth quarter, Heritage Global completed a number of successful global online sales, including projects for Pfizer, Amgen, PharmaScience, Vericel, Pharmaceutics International, Aerospace Manufacturing Group, and Astellas. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was largely attributable to compensation related items from variable compensation arrangements. Heritage Global recorded a $0.4 million non-operating loss in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the non-cash fair value adjustment of its contingent consideration from the acquisition of National Loan Exchange Inc. (NLEX), compared to a non-operating loss of approximately $1.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company recorded a net loss of approximately $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, or $0.01 per share, essentially flat compared to the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA, a commonly used non-GAAP financial measure, was $0.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $0.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management as a supplemental tool to evaluate the underlying operating performance of the Company on an ongoing basis and should be considered together with Heritage Global’s GAAP financial measures. Adjustments in the quarter related to one-time or non-recurring items including the non-cash fair value adjustment of its contingent consideration from the acquisition of NLEX and the settlement costs related to a matter originating in 2009.\nFull Year 2017 Summary of Financial Results:\nTotal revenue in 2017 declined 16%, from $23.8 million to $20.1 million. However, the decrease in total revenue was due to a $6.3 million, or 74%, decline in asset sales revenue versus the prior year, with the sale of the Company’s real estate inventory in 2016 accounting for most of the decline. Lower asset sales were partially offset by a $2.6 million, or 17%, year-over-year increase in higher-margin services revenue. Gross profit, or total revenue net of costs of revenue, increased 23% to $15.4 million in 2017 from $12.5 million in 2016, due principally to higher margin services revenue and the timing and magnitude of certain asset liquidation transactions together resulting in a $6.6 million, or 58%, reduction in the cost of total revenue. Adjusted EBITDA, a commonly used non-GAAP financial measure, was increased 241% to $2.1 million in 2017, compared to $0.6 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management as a supplemental tool to evaluate the underlying operating performance of the Company on an ongoing basis and should be considered together with Heritage Global’s GAAP financial measures. Adjustments for the year related to one-time or non-recurring items including the non-cash fair value adjustment of its contingent consideration from the acquisition of NLEX and the settlement costs related to an almost decade old litigation matter. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017, and significantly affected U.S. tax law by changing how the U.S. imposes income tax on multinational corporations. The Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for HGI tax years beginning in 2018. The re-measurement of the federal portion of the Company’s deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2017 resulted in an approximate $1.4 million reduction HGI’s deferred tax liabilities. Additionally, the Company had no impact in the U.S. with respect to the Toll Charge under the Tax Act, as a result of the allocation of foreign subsidiary deficits against positive earnings.\nHeritage Global Chief Executive Officer Ross Dove stated, “Heritage Global ended 2017 on a strong note and delivered another year of solid financial performance across our asset liquidation, valuation and advisory services businesses, resulting in a 23% increase in gross profit, compared to the prior year. The execution of our strategies to grow our platform, coupled with the progress we are making in improving the Company’s financial results, led to a significant gross margin improvement and record adjusted EBITDA growth to $2.1 million in 2017.\n“HGI’s unique, value-driven corporate and financial asset solutions platform continued to generate positive results reflecting our growing base of global clients, with strong growth particularly in our brokerage and M&A advisory services divisions, which saw a 17% rise in services revenue.\n“Looking ahead, HGI remains committed to strategically grow our portfolio of global asset solutions by adding complementary capabilities that serve a broad range of businesses, while creating added value for our corporate clients and customers. To support our goals for near and long-term growth, we will continue to implement our initiatives focused on enhancing profitability and driving efficiencies across our platform, while actively managing our capital structure to maximize cash flow and reduce leverage.\n“In closing, we are pleased with our 2017 financial performance and the success we have achieved in improving top and bottom-line results. HGI’s business divisions focused on auction services, M&A advisory services, patents and trademarks, brokerage and real estate services continue to deliver value to our corporate clients, customers and partners. We remain confident that our strategy to further expand our platform of diversified global asset solutions, combined with the ongoing successful execution of our expense management and profitability initiatives, is a formula for sustainable financial growth and enhancement of long-term shareholder value.”\nDefinitions and Disclosures Regarding non-GAAP Financial Information\nAdjusted EBITDA reflects the standard definition of EBITDA (net income (loss) plus depreciation and amortization, interest and other expense, and provision for income taxes), adjusted further to reflect the effects of settlement accrual charges, plus or minus fair value adjustments of contingent consideration and plus stock-based compensation. Management believes that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure, when considered together with the GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to make operating and strategic decisions and to evaluate the Company’s performance. The Company has disclosed this non-GAAP financial measure so that investors have the same financial data that management uses, with the intention of assisting investors to make comparisons to the Company’s historical operating results and analyze its underlying performance. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplemental tool to evaluate the underlying operating performance of the Company on an ongoing basis. The use of Adjusted EBITDA is not meant to be, and should not be, considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, any GAAP financial measure. You should carefully evaluate the financial information cited in the tables at the end of this news announcement which reconciles GAAP reported net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented herein.\nAbout Heritage Global Inc.
