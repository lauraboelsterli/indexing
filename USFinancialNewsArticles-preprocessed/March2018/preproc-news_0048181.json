Britain's Home Secretary Amber Rudd, leaves 10 Downing Street in London, March 14, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville \n“It is a challenging target,” Rudd told a parliamentary committee. She declined, when asked, to repeat the government’s longstanding target to bring net migration below 100,000, saying instead her aim was to reduce it to sustainable levels. \n“There are many ways of reducing immigration ... and there are going to be more ways of doing it once we leave the European Union.” Reporting by William James and Alistair Smout; editing by Andrew MacAskill",
