    "text": "Reeve to lead Collective Medical’s nationwide expansion across all points of care\nSALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Collective Medical , delivering the nation’s largest and most effective network for care collaboration, today announced the appointment of Andrew Reeve as senior vice president of sales. In this role, Reeve leads a seasoned sales team of healthcare experts focused on expanding the Collective Medical network and real-time, risk-adjusted event notification and care collaboration platform across the country and all points of care.\nReeve has been instrumental in Collective Medical’s recent expansion across the country, including statewide adoption of the company’s platform in Virginia and West Virginia. Prior to his work at Collective Medical, Reeve led Harris Corporation’s entry into the healthcare market and played a lead role in the development of infrastructure for the National Health Information Network (NHIN) and the Florida and Oregon Health Information Exchanges (HIEs). His work led Harris to be established as one of the premier federal health IT vendors through contracts with the Department of Veterans Affairs, Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Defense.\n“We’re delighted to work alongside and learn from Drew as he leads our sales team,” says Chris Klomp, CEO of Collective Medical. “Coupled with an abiding value set, he possesses deep domain knowledge and an intimate understanding of the value, successes, and challenges of interoperability in the healthcare system. I’m thrilled that he will be leading our network expansion efforts.”\nKlomp adds that, “Drew’s experience working with HIEs and federal health IT organizations is incredibly valuable as Collective Medical seeks to partner alongside these entities to support care team collaboration.”\nThe company currently partners with 14 HIEs, both public and private entities, including those in California, West Virginia, Virginia and Oregon. Where an HIE is not available, Collective Medical has built real-time networks of providers and payers who want to collaborate on complex patients who require higher-levels of coordination to meet their underlying needs.\n“I joined Collective Medical because I see the vision of care coordination and delivering the right information directly into providers’ workflow at the point of care being realized,” says Andrew Reeve. “We’ve made an impact on patient outcomes across all points of care: hospitals and health systems, ACOs, payers, long-term and post-acute care providers and behavioral health organizations.” Reeve adds, “I’m privileged to play a role in helping care teams improve patients’ lives as we expand our network across the country.”\nCollective Medical is endorsed as a best practice for emergency medicine by the American College of Emergency Physicians. The company has been recognized by Inc. Magazine and by the MountainWest Capital Network as one of Utah’s fastest growing companies. The company recently announced a $47.5 million investment led by Kleiner Perkins that will fuel the network’s nationwide expansion.\nLearn more about Collective Medical’s impact at www.collectivemedical.com .\nABOUT COLLECTIVE MEDICAL\nCollective Medical empowers care teams to improve patient outcomes by closing the communication gaps that undermine patient care.
