    "text": "March 14, 2018 / 3:53 PM / Updated 35 minutes ago Bayer reports progress in talks with Russia over Monsanto deal Reuters Staff 1 Min Read MOSCOW (Reuters) - Bayer said on Wednesday progress was being made in talks with Russia’s competition watchdog FAS over the company’s planned takeover of Monsanto. The logo of Bayer AG is pictured at the Bayer Healthcare subgroup production plant in Wuppertal, Germany February 24, 2014. REUTERS/Ina Fassbender/File Photo “We moved ahead in the negotiations with FAS towards a mutually beneficial agreement to support the competitiveness of Russian agriculture, including transfer of technologies,” Bayer said in an emailed statement. Monsanto logo is displayed on a screen where the stock is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S. on May 9, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo “It is important that we have found common ground for the key milestones with the intent to approve the acquisition of Monsanto in the nearest future,” Bayer said. The German company last month filed a lawsuit in a Russian court against FAS after it made any approval conditional on Bayer sharing plant breeding technologies in Russia among other remedies, while extending the review of the deal. An arbitration court in Moscow on Wednesday postponed the preliminary hearing of Bayer’s lawsuit until April 11 at the German company’s request, Russian news agencies reported.
