    "text": "March 16, 2018 / 11:04 AM / Updated 24 minutes ago Norway's Centre Party to vote for no-confidence motion against justice minister - NTB agency Reuters Staff 1 Min Read OSLO (Reuters) - An opposition party in Norway, the Centre Party, has said it will back a motion of no confidence in Justice Minister Sylvi Listhaug, Norwegian news agency NTB reported on Friday, heightening the risk that the minority cabinet may fall.
