    "text": "March 30, 2018 / 9:43 PM / in 6 minutes REFILE-Snapchat parent cuts 7 percent of its global workforce in March Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Refiles to add missing word in second paragraph) \nMarch 30 (Reuters) - Snap Inc on Friday said it cut 7 percent of its global workforce in March, as disclosed by it in a regulatory filing here \nThe social media company said it would incur about $10 million of cash expenditure due to severance costs to be reflected in the current quarter ending March 31. \nAs a result of the layoffs, primarily in its engineering and sales teams, the company said it sees savings of about $25 million in 2018. \nThe company had said it had 3,069 employees as of Dec. 31, 2017, according to its annual filing bit.ly/2pScNbz. \nThe Snapchat parent has been under pressure from investors to reduce costs after revenue fell short of analyst expectations during Snap’s first year as a publicly traded company. \nEarlier this month, a company memo had shown that the company would cut just over 120 engineers and reorganize its engineering team, Reuters reported. \nThe Southern California-based company said the workforce reduction “is to align resources around our top strategic priorities and to reflect structural changes in our business.” Reporting by Nivedita Balu in Bengaluru; Editing by Sandra Maler",
