    "text": "CHATTANOOGA, Tenn.,\nCovenant Transportation Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CVTI) (“CTG”) announced today its expectations regarding financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\nFinancial and Operating Results\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, David R. Parker, offered the following comments: “The truckload freight environment has been favorable during the first quarter to date, leading to operating results that are exceeding our expectations. Through March 13th, we have experienced the following:\nFor the two months ended February 28, 2018, average freight revenue per tractor increased 6.3% compared to the two months ended February 28, 2017, as average freight revenue per total mile increased 9.2%, while average miles per tractor decreased 2.6%. Freight revenue is defined as total revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue.\nOur fleet size was essentially flat for the first two months of 2018 compared to the same 2017 period. Miles per tractor were impacted by a decrease in the percentage of our fleet comprised of team-driven trucks and a lower average seated truck percentage.\nThus far during the month of March, the trends have been similar to those through February.\nThe robust freight environment is also impacting our expenses, leading to higher employee and owner-operator pay and increases in purchased transportation expense (the payments we make to third party carriers to secure capacity for our freight brokerage operations).\nAs a result of the trends mentioned above, we expect to report consolidated earnings for the first quarter of 2018 in a range of $0.17 to $0.23 per diluted share. These expected results compare to a reported consolidated net loss of approximately $39 thousand, or ($0.00) per diluted share for the first quarter of 2017. Net loss for the first quarter of 2017 included an unfavorable impact totaling approximately $0.6 million attributable to an increased reserve in respect to an adverse cargo claim judgment stemming from a cargo loss in 2008.\"\nCovenant Transportation Group, Inc. is the holding company for several transportation providers that offer premium transportation services for customers throughout the United States. The consolidated group includes operations from Covenant Transport and Covenant Transport Solutions of Chattanooga, Tennessee; Southern Refrigerated Transport of Texarkana, Arkansas; and Star Transportation of Nashville, Tennessee. In addition, Transport Enterprise Leasing, of Chattanooga, Tennessee is an integral affiliated company providing revenue equipment sales and leasing services to the trucking industry. The Company's Class A common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select market under the symbol, “CVTI”.\nThis press release contains certain statements that may be considered within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and such statements are subject to the safe harbor created by those sections and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended.
