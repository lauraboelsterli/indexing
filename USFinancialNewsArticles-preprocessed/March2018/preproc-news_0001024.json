    "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc. (“CorEnergy” or the “Company”) today announced financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nFiscal Year 2017 Performance Summary\nFiscal Year 2017 financial highlights are as follows:\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2017 Per Share Total Basic Diluted Net Income (Attributable to Common Stockholders) 1 $ 24,648,802 $ 2.07 $ 2.07 NAREIT Funds from Operations (NAREIT FFO) 1 $ 46,308,969 $ 3.89 $ 3.59 Funds From Operations (FFO) 1 $ 46,046,781 $ 3.87 $ 3.57 Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO) 1 $ 50,536,194 $ 4.25 $ 3.81 Dividends Declared to Common Stockholders $ 3.00 1 Management uses AFFO as a measure of long-term sustainable operational performance. NAREIT FFO, FFO, and AFFO are non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of NAREIT FFO, FFO and AFFO, as presented, to Net Income Attributable to CorEnergy Stockholders are included at the end of this press release. See Note 1 for additional information.\nRecent Developments\nMaintained dividend: Declared common stock dividend of $0.75 per share ($3.00 annualized) for the fourth quarter 2017, in line with the previous nine quarterly dividends Building relationship with new tenant: Acquisition of Portland Terminal tenant, Arc Logistics, by Zenith Energy U.S. LP (\"Zenith Energy\") closed on December 21, 2017. Last of BDC legacy portfolio rolling off: Received $7.6 million in cash proceeds, plus an interest in Arc Terminal Joliet Holdings, valued at $1.2 million for the Company's pro-rata share of the sale of Lightfoot Partners to Zenith Energy Increased interest in prolific Pinedale Field: Purchased from Prudential Insurance Group of America (\"Prudential\") its 18.95% minority interest in the Pinedale LGS for $32.9 million Prudential provided $41 million of 6.5% fixed rate debt, due December 2022, which was utilized to pay off the Pinedale LP credit facility balance and to complete the purchase of the minority interest Received favorable PLR: Converted Omega Pipeline to a qualified REIT subsidiary, from a taxable REIT subsidiary (TRS) following the receipt of a private letter ruling (PLR) from the IRS Increased activity at Fort Leonard Wood: Omega was selected for a Utility Energy Service Contract (UESC) at Fort Leonard Wood.\n\"CorEnergy exited 2017 in a much stronger position than we entered it. The energy downturn has enabled us to demonstrate the durability of our overall strategy and revenue model. CORR acquired the minority stake in the Pinedale LGS and sold our last remaining BDC investment. We strengthened our balance sheet by issuing perpetual preferred stock, upsizing our credit facility, and refinancing the asset level debt on the Pinedale LGS,\" said CorEnergy CEO Dave Schulte. \"We believe CorEnergy is well positioned for additional growth in 2018, with over $155 million of liquidity and multiple acquisition opportunities in various stages of evaluation. The REIT model of infrastructure ownership is emerging as a flexible source of long-term capital for energy companies. CORR has the ability to own and lease assets in a passive financing, as well as in operating subsidiaries where the preponderance of assets are pipelines and storage terminals.\"\nDividend Declaration\nCommon Stock: A fourth quarter 2017 dividend of $0.75 per share (or $3.00 per share annualized) was declared for CorEnergy’s common stock. The dividend was payable on February 28, 2018, to stockholders of record on February 14, 2018.\nPreferred Stock: For the Company’s 7.375% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, a cash dividend of $0.4609375 per depositary share was declared. The preferred stock dividend, which equates to an annual dividend payment of $1.84375 per depositary share, was payable on February 28, 2018, to stockholders of record on February 14, 2018.\nPortfolio Update\nGrand Isle Gathering System: The tenant of the Grand Isle Gathering System, Energy XXI Gulf Coast, continues to make strides towards optimizing production while maintaining costs. The company recently announced its 2018 capital budget plan and anticipates drilling six wells this year. These wells are expected to be in the West Delta and South Timbalier fields, which are considered core properties by EXXI and partially served by our system.\nPinedale Liquids Gathering System: On December 29, 2017, we purchased the remaining 18.95% interest in Pinedale LP, from Prudential for approximately $32.9 million. Concurrently, Pinedale LP entered into an amended $41.0 million credit facility, with Prudential as the lender, for a fixed rate of 6.5% for five years.\nCorEnergy received approximately $587,000 in participating rents from the utilization of the Pinedale LGS by Ultra Petroleum in 2017. The Company is further encouraged by the recent successes of its tenant in horizontal well drilling, and its plans to expand the program in 2018.\nPortland Terminal: On December 21, 2017, Zenith Energy closed on its acquisition of the parent company of the Portland Terminal tenant, Arc Logistics. Pursuant to the Portland Terminal Lease, the tenant maintains the option to repurchase the asset from CorEnergy, subject to a 90-day notice, as well as the right to terminate the lease on the fifth and tenth anniversaries of the agreement. CorEnergy provided Zenith Energy an extension of the deadline for notification of an exercise of its option to terminate the lease agreement on its fifth anniversary to August 1, 2018, from February 1, 2018.\nMoGas Pipeline: MoGas continues to explore means to offset the decline in revenue from the amended Spire contract, announced in March 2017. MoGas currently anticipates filing a rate case with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in the second quarter of 2018.\nOmega Pipeline: In November 2017, Omega was selected for a UESC at Fort Leonard Wood in south-central Missouri. The pipeline currently serves that United States Army post with natural gas distribution services and the UESC program will provide comprehensive gas, electricity and water efficiency improvements. CorEnergy believes this initiative could last four to five years and produce incremental earnings.\nDuring 2017, the Company received a private letter ruling from the IRS which qualified the revenue from Omega's long-term contract with Fort Leonard Wood as REIT-qualifying rent income from real property. Effective December 31, 2017, Omega was converted to a qualified REIT subsidiary, from a taxable REIT subsidiary.\nLightfoot Partners: In connection with the Arc Logistics acquisition by Zenith Energy, we received our pro-rata share of the proceeds upon the closing of the transaction for our holdings in Lightfoot. Total cash proceeds of $7.6 million were net of approximately $1.2 million related to a required reinvestment in Arc Terminal Joliet Holdings. As of December 31, 2017, our remaining private company interests in Lightfoot and Arc Terminal Joliet Holdings were valued at approximately $3.0 million.\nOutlook\nCorEnergy believes acquisitions enhance the stability of its operations, reducing risk to existing stockholders, because of the diversification benefits and added potential for dividend growth. The Company is evaluating a broad set of infrastructure opportunities and targets transacting on one to two acquisitions per year, with a target range of $50 to $250 million per project. CorEnergy intends to finance these acquisitions through the use of capacity on its revolver, partnerships with co-investors, portfolio level debt, and, if beneficial to existing stockholders, prudent preferred and/or common equity issuances. There can be no assurance that any of these acquisition opportunities will result in consummated transactions.\nCorEnergy intends to continue paying quarterly dividends of $0.75 per share ($3.00 annualized). The Company targets revenue growth of 1-3% annually from existing contracts through inflation-based and participating rent adjustments and additional growth from acquisitions. Dependent upon the level of revenue growth achieved, CorEnergy will assess its ability to responsibly grow its dividend above current levels.\nFiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call\nCorEnergy will host a conference call on Thursday, March 1, 2018, at 1:00 p.m. Central Time to discuss its financial results.

Diluted (3) $ 3.81 $ 3.93 $ 3.56 (1)\nBased on the economic return to CorEnergy resulting from the sale of our 40 percent undivided interest in EIP, we determined that it was appropriate to eliminate the portion of EIP lease income attributable to return of capital, as a means to more accurately reflect the EIP lease revenue contribution to our sustainable AFFO. We believe that the portion of the EIP lease revenue attributable to return of capital, unless adjusted, overstates our distribution-paying capabilities and is not representative of sustainable EIP income over the life of the lease. We completed the sale of EIP on April 1, 2015.\n(2)\nDiluted per share calculations include dilutive adjustments for convertible note interest expense, discount amortization and deferred debt issuance amortization.\n(3)\nDiluted per share calculations include a dilutive adjustment for convertible note interest expense.\nView source version on businesswire.com : http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180228006529/en/\nCorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc.\nInvestor Relations\nLesley Schorgl, 877-699-CORR (2677)\ninfo@corenergy.reit\nSource: CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc.",
