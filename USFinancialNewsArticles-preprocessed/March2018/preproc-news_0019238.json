    "text": "TEL AVIV, Israel, March 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nICL (NYSE: ICL) (TASE: ICL) held this morning (Thursday) an investors conference in the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. At the 'Cultivating the Present, Developing the Future' conference, Johanan Locker, ICL's Executive Chairman, along with Asher Grinbaum, ICL's Acting CEO and the Company's executive management, presented the Company's new strategy for the coming years.\nThe new strategy is based on two dimensions: the first dimension focuses on optimization and competitive excellence in ICL's mineral chains (potash, phosphates and bromine), which remain the foundation of ICL's activities. The Company will continue to implement efficiency measures, will increase the competitiveness of its mineral assets, and will leverage its competitive capabilities and advantages for its downstream specialty products.\nThe second dimension is based on accelerated growth in advanced crop nutrition, while leveraging ICL's position and capabilities in the fertilizer market in general, and in the specialty fertilizers market, in particular. In this context, the Company will invest in the development of new products, technologies and solutions geared to the farmer, with increasing use of precision agriculture.\nJohanan Locker, ICL Chairman, stated: \"ICL's strategy is based on two key foundations: the first is our mineral business, and the second - advanced agricultural solutions. The next generation of farmers will speak a new farming language, even though its aim will remain the same: increasing yields. High-tech has come to agriculture as well. That is the direction the world is going to, and ICL has a lot to offer, with its specialty fertilizers platform that encompasses a broad spectrum, from basic fertilizers to fertilizers that are high-tech level.\"\nLocker added that the Company is taking steps to adapt itself to the changing realities and has declared its intention to invest tens of millions of dollars in the coming years in entrepreneurial initiatives, innovation and development of agricultural technologies: \"We are examining cooperation with several strategic partners, establishment of innovation laboratories, as well as a broad spectrum of investment options, from investments in funds, to establishment of venture capital funds and to direct investment in startups.\"\nAsher Grinbaum , ICL Acting CEO: \"As responsible management, keenly aware of the realities on the ground, we understood that we have to do two main things: take meaningful stabilization steps to create a solid foundation for the future and to re-examine and reshape our strategic direction. The actions we took, led to material improvement of our profitability, as well as our cash flow and significantly strengthened our financial position. Thus, creating the financial resources needed to support our future growth. We believe that we have brought the Company to an excellent starting point to implement our strategy, which we presented today, and to ensure ICL's future for the coming years.\"\nThe conference's presentations are available on the Company's website:\nhttp://www.icl-group.com/investors/icls-strategy-2018-israeli-investor-conference/\nICL will host a teleconference on March 8, at 8:00 AM EST (1:00 PM London time, 3:00 PM Israel time) to discuss its strategy.
