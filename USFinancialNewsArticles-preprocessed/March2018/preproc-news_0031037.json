    "text": "NEW YORK, March 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hernan Saenz, a 20-year veteran of Bain & Company, has been appointed to lead the firm’s Global Performance Improvement Practice. His appointment was announced today by Manny Maceda, the firm’s worldwide managing director. He will continue to be based in the firm’s Dallas office.\nBain’s Performance Improvement practice is focused on helping clients deliver on their strategic goals through cost transformation and operational excellence. A major focus for the practice will continue to be the deployment of digital and advanced analytics tools to fundamentally disrupt and transform industry cost structures.\nSaenz specializes in corporate transformations, full potential programs, cost and operational turnarounds, and large-scale change efforts. He has significant cost and transformation expertise across a number of industries, including airlines, consumer good and retail, industrial products, distribution and healthcare.\n“Performance Improvement has been and will continue to be one of our priority areas going forward globally across all of our industries – it is key priority for most, if not all of our clients,” said Maceda. “Hernan is one of Bain & Company’s most seasoned professionals in this area and his leadership will be a significant asset for Bain’s clients to draw upon in their efforts to strategically transform their cost structures and establish advantage in their respective industries.”\nIn his new role, Saenz will be responsible for business and client development, as well as the management of the practice’s consultants and professional staff. His focus will include product development, new delivery models, and leading the practice’s go-to-market efforts, specifically in the areas of cost transformation and operational excellence.\n“Cost is a critical item in every CEO agenda – whether to restore profitability, to reinforce competitive advantage, or to fund and realize strategy. With the new set of options enabled by the digital revolution, companies need to think transformationally and work toward reinventing themselves,” said Saenz. “I am eager to collaborate with my colleagues around the world to continue to help our clients not only reduce costs, but to reinvest those funds into better serving their customers and developing new products, services, and business models for growth.”\nSaenz’s articles on performance improvement have appeared in a number of publications, including Harvard Business Review, Business Strategy Review, World Business, The Wall Street Journal – Mint , and The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).\nSaenz was most recently managing director of the firm’s Dallas, Houston, and Mexico City offices. During his tenure, the Bain Southwest region more than doubled in size. He was appointed to his new role after returning to Bain from a year-long sabbatical, during which he taught strategy at Cornell University, his alma mater. He has lived and worked for Bain in North and Latin America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region.\nSaenz is the founder of the firm’s Latinos at Bain, an affinity network that focuses on the recruitment, development and retention of the top Latino business talent.\nPrior to joining Bain, he was a faculty member in economics at INCAE, a business school in Latin America. He previously worked at a consulting firm serving banks and other financial institutions in Latin America.\nLocally in Dallas, he serves on the President’s Council at SMU, as the Chairman of Governing Board of the Perot Museum, and on the North Texas Chapter of YPO.\nSaenz was named to Consulting magazine’s annual “Top 25 Consultants” in recognition for his work with clients across industries over the last 15 years.\nHe earned his MBA and MILR from Cornell University, as well as an M.A. in economics from Stanford University and a B.A. in economics from Harvard College, where he graduated magna cum laude . He is a member of the Johnson School Advisory Council at Cornell and was honored as recipient of Cornell’s Distinguished Latino Award in 2012.\nEditor's Note: To arrange an interview, contact Dan Pinkney at dan.pinkney@bain.com or +1 646 562 8102\nAbout Bain & Company\nBain & Company is the management consulting firm that the world's business leaders come to when they want results.
