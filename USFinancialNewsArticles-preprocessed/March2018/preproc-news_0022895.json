Marcus Morris had 17 points off the bench and Jaylen Brown added 14 for the Celtics, who survived a scare when Brown walked off the court on his own accord after sustaining a bad fall while trying to dunk in the third quarter.\nBrown later was taken to a hospital over concerns he sustained a concussion, but he tweeted that he was OK.\nThe Celtics shot 49.4 percent from the field and 34.4 percent from 3-point range while picking up 28 assists.\nTerry Rozier added 13 points off the bench for Boston, whose reserves outscored Minnesota’s 42-20. No. 3 pick Jayson Tatum had 12 points and five rebounds for the Celtics.\nMinnesota had six players in double figures, but Karl-Anthony Towns and Andrew Wiggins combined for just 28 points on 11-of-33 shooting. Wiggins went 6 of 21 from the field and had four turnovers to go along with 13 points, seven rebounds and four assists. Towns added 15 points and 11 rebounds.\nJamal Crawford had 15 points and four assists off the bench for the Timberwolves, and Jeff Teague had 13 points, eight assists and five rebounds.\nBoston led 60-46 at halftime after using a 14-4 run midway through the second quarter to take a double-digit lead.\nThe Celtics capped off a three-game road trip with a 2-1 record, making them 5-1 in their past six road games.\nBoston returns home to face the Indiana Pacers on Sunday night while the Timberwolves cap off a rough two-game stretch with a Sunday afternoon tilt against the Golden State Warriors.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
