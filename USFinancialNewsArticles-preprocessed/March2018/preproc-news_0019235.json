    "text": "REDWOOD CITY, Calif., March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Coherus BioSciences, Inc. (Nasdaq:CHRS), today reviewed corporate events and reported financial results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nFourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results:\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $31.5 million compared to $59.0 million for the same period in 2016. R&D expenses for the fiscal year 2017 were $162.4 million, as compared to $254.4 million for the same period in 2016. The decrease in R&D expenses in the fourth quarter over the same period in 2016 was mainly due to the reduction in manufacturing, analytical and clinical costs associated with the CHS-0214 (etanercept (Enbrel®) biosimilar candidate) and CHS-1420 (adalimumab (Humira®) biosimilar candidate) programs. The decrease in R&D expenses in the fiscal year ended 2017 over the same period in 2016 was mainly attributable to a decrease in clinical development costs associated with the CHS-0214 and CHS-1420 programs. General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $15.0 million, compared to $15.3 million for the same period in 2016. G&A expenses for the fiscal year 2017 were $71.3 million, as compared to $51.6 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in G&A expenses in 2017 were mainly attributable to salary and stock compensation costs associated with the hiring of personnel in the first half of 2017 to support the CHS-1701 (pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) biosimilar candidate) pre-commercial activities and costs related to legal and other professional services. Net loss attributable to Coherus for the fourth quarter of 2017 was ($49.1) million, or ($0.84) per share, compared to a net loss of ($75.9) million, or ($1.71) per share, for the same period in 2016. Net loss attributable to Coherus for 2017 was ($238.2) million, or ($4.48) per share, compared to a net loss of ($127.3) million, or ($3.04) per share, for 2016. Cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities – short term totaled $126.9 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $150.1 million as of September 30, 2017.\nGuidance for 2018:\nCHS-1701 (pegfilgrastim (Neulasta®) biosimilar)\nAnticipate resubmitting the biologics license application (BLA) directly after receipt of minutes post completion of FDA meetings concerning the complete response letter, completion of immunogenicity sample processing and integration of such data into the resubmission.
