    "text": "Published: Mar 11, 2018 4:27 p.m. ET Share \nPlan would support banning bump stocks, raising minimum age to buy guns Reuters President Donald Trump speaks at a rally Saturday night in Moon Township, Pa. \nBy Michael C. Bender \nWASHINGTON — The White House is expected to release a plan on Sunday that would urge states to consider raising the age to buy certain firearms and would recommend that states allow school staffers to carry concealed weapons, according to White House officials who have been briefed on the proposal. \nResponding to the shooting deaths of 17 people at a Florida high school last month, the plan would include President Donald Trump’s support for banning so-called bump stocks, which allow certain firearms to fire as rapidly as machine guns, the officials said. The U.S. Justice Department said Saturday that it has submitted a regulation to ban the devices, making them illegal to own or sell. \nThe White House plan comes in the wake of last month’s mass shooting in Parkland, Fla. Following the deaths, Trump said he wanted to make school safety the White House’s top priority. With midterm elections approaching, Republican leaders also are seeking ways to address school safety without prompting a backlash from gun owners or the National Rifle Association, the nation’s top gun lobby. \nThe plan would signal the president’s support for two gun-related bills being considered by Congress, the officials said. One, known as the “Fix NICS” bill, is designed to improve background checks for gun purchases, a measure that has run into hurdles in Congress. The second, known as the STOP School Violence Act, would authorize $50 million a year on school-safety improvements, including violence-prevention training for teachers and students. ",
