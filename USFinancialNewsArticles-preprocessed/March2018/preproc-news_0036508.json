The company said pretax profit rose to 288.7 million pounds ($405.2 million) for the six months ended Jan. 31, from 247.6 million pounds a year earlier. Average selling prices rose 7.7 percent to 275,945 pounds. “Positive trading environment, together with a substantial order book, bodes well for the full year and should enable the group to complete in excess of 10,000 new homes,” Bellway said.
