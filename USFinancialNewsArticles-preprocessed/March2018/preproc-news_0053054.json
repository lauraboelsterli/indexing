    "text": "March 28, 2018 / 3:37 PM / Updated 20 minutes ago Thyssenkrupp supervisory board to discuss Tata Steel joint venture - source Tom Käckenhoff 2 Min Read \nDUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Thyssenkrupp’s ( TKAG.DE ) supervisory board will discuss a planned European steel joint venture with Tata Steel ( TISC.NS ) at an extraordinary meeting on April 12, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. FILE PHOTO - A logo of ThyssenKrupp AG is pictured outside the ThyssenKrupp headquarters in Essen, November 23, 2017. REUTERS/Thilo Schmuelgen \nThe joint venture, which was originally due to be signed early in 2018, has faced renewed criticism after German labour representatives threatened to withdraw approval over the planned legal structure of the entity’s Dutch operations. \nLast month Tata Steel guaranteed its Dutch division it could continue to operate as an independent company within the joint venture with ThyssenKrupp, with control over its own profits and with an independent supervisory board. \n“It is not acceptable that only we in Germany are to be responsible for the risks of the joint venture and the Dutch entity is dodging responsibility,” Thyssenkrupp supervisory board member Tekin Nasikkol told Reuters, adding local employees would not accept this. \nTata Steel declined to comment. \nThyssenkrupp and Tata Steel last year announced plans to combine their European steel operations to create the continent’s second-largest player after ArcelorMittal ( MT.AS ). \nSteel workers at Germany’s Thyssenkrupp last month voted in favour of a labour agreement that will safeguard jobs and plants in a planned joint venture with Tata Steel until 2026, removing a key hurdle for the tie-up.
