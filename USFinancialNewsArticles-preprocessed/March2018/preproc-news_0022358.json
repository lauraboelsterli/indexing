U.S. President Donald Trump announces a presidential proclamation placing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, at the White House in Washington, U.S. March 8, 2018. REUTERS/Leah Millis Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Brazilian President Michel Temer, WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo said,“You know when it starts but not how it will turn out” when countries engage in mutual retaliation. Brazil has said it will seek exemption from the newly imposed tariffs. Reporting by Jake Spring; Writing by Bruno Federowski; Editing by Leslie Adler",
