    "text": "341 COMMENTS For this year’s midterm elections, Democrats have history on their side: The sitting president’s party has gained seats in both houses in just two midterms in the last 150 years. \nRecent midterm waves -- where the opposing party picked up significant numbers of House seats -- tended to share five common themes: A low presidential approval rating; intensity in the opposition party; success in special elections; a lot of retirements in the majority party; and a weak economy.\nDemocrats are certainly expected to pick up some seats in 2018. But Republicans have a substantial majority in the House and a strong economy. \nSo which party will prevail?\nIn the video above, we explore conditions that are ripe for a “blue wave” that could enable Democrats to take back the House and Senate, or at least wash away some of the Republican power in Washington.\nWrite to Aaron Zitner at Aaron.Zitner@dowjones.com",
