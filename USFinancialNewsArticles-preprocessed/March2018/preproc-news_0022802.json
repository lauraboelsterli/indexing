    "text": "LONDON, March 9 (Reuters) - The European Union’s banking watchdog set out a “roadmap” on Friday to help plug gaps in how the rapidly evolving financial technology sector is regulated.\nNew EU rules from January make it easier for start-ups to offer traditional banking services such as payments.\nAndrea Enria, head of the European Banking Authority, said the watchdog will analyse the nature of services provided by fintech firms “with a view to ensuring that similar services, entailing comparable risks, are regulated in a consistent way across the EU”.\nThe watchdog, which helps the bloc flesh out banking rules, will report on its assessment by the end of the year.\nReporting by Huw Jones; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
