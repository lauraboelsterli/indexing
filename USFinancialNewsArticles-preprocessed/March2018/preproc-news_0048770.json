Preitauer will succeed founding CEO Pamela Morris, who will retire in May 2018.\nPreitauer is currently with Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey. He is the CEO of Horizon NJ Health which is the state's largest Medicaid plan with more than $6B in revenue and 1 million members. Preitauer has an impressive resume that includes leadership positions with multiple national insurers.\nPreitauer will join CareSource on May 1.
