    "text": "HONG KONG/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - At least two Chinese companies are preparing bids for industrial conglomerate General Electric’s ( GE.N ) remaining lighting assets in a potentially $1 billion deal, according to people familiar with the situation.\nFILE PHOTO: The General Electric logo is pictured on the General Electric offshore wind turbine plant in Montoir-de-Bretagne, near Saint-Nazaire, western France, November 21, 2016. REUTERS/Stephane Mahe/File Photo MLS Co ( 002745.SZ ) and Foshan Electrical and Lighting Co ( 000541.SZ ), both lighting manufacturers based in southern China’s Guangdong province, have been in talks with lenders to finance a potential bid for the asset, one of the people said.\nGE on Monday sent out teasers to interested parties about the sale process, to be followed by information memos in a couple of weeks and a first round of bidding thereafter, another source said.\nGE declined to comment. MLS could not be reached for comment, while Foshan did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The people could not be named as the information is confidential.\nIn mid-February, GE reached a deal to sell the European parts of its overseas lighting business to a company controlled by former executive Joerg Bauer for an undisclosed amount. That marked the first step in the divesture of the lighting business.\nShedding the remaining, mainly U.S.-based lighting business is part of a broad restructuring plan aimed at divesting $20 billion worth of assets to focus the remaining company on three core divisions: power, aviation and health care.\nAmong other options, GE is exploring a sale of its industrial gas engine business that could be worth as much as $2 billion, people close to the matter said last month.\nProfit at GE’s lighting business fell sharply last year. It earned $93 million on revenue of nearly $2 billion in 2017, down from $199 million on $4.8 billion in 2016.\nThe U.S. lighting activities will also be shopped to peers such as Cree ( CREE.O ), Acuity ( AYI.N ), Leviton, Hubbell ( HUBB.N ) and Eaton ( ETN.N ), one of the people said.\nGE said last month they would be marketed as part of a separate sale or sales.\nEditing by Mark Potter\n ",
