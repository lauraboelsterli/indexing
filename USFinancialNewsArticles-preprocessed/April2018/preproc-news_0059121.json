    "text": "MEXICO CITY, April 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Grupo Financiero Interacciones, S.A.B. de C.V., (BMV: GFINTERO) , (\"Grupo Financiero Interacciones\" or \"GFI\"), the largest specialized Mexican financial group with a business model focused on providing financing, risk management and financial advisory services mainly to the Mexican public sector, today announced results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018.\nTo obtain the full text of this earnings release, please visit\nhttp://www.investorsinteracciones.com/images/media/quartelyResults/2018/1Q18/1Q18_Earnings_Release_Ingles_VF.pdf\nExecutive Summary: Simplified Financial Information (\"SFI\")\nDisclaimer: As a result of the uniqueness of our business model, we simplified GFI's financial information in an effort to make it more efficient for market participants to analyze our financial group. Simplified Financial Information (\"SFI\") is adjusted for valuation effects, non-recurring items and includes reclassifications of regulatory financial statements.\nFundamentals\nAs part of GFI's fundamentals during the quarter, states and municipalities presented a liquidity surplus of 14.5% relative to their originally budgeted infrastructure agenda, which is below last year's surplus of 16.5%, in addition to an annual three-month federal transfer growth of 5.6%.\nGiven this year's upcoming elections and its implications within the Financial Discipline Law's (\"FDL\") framework, states and municipalities covered their demand for short term needs through the use of factoring products, which have no debt ceiling within the FDL. State elections in particular not only made these debt acquisitions preferable to states and municipalities, but also accelerated them before the elections take place. GFI's expertise and deep understanding in the application of the FDL as well as its proactive approach in preparing its business model to leverage these opportunities, enabled it to offer and capture the most attractive opportunities available in the market.\nIt's important to note that GFI had to reconstitute its loan portfolio due to payments of Ps.109,479 million during the last twelve months.\nAdditionally, infrastructure spending in the country continues with a strong momentum of growth, reaching a 9 year high with Ps.14 billion invested in the month of January [2] , which adds an additional driver of growth in conjunction with GFI's current pipeline of opportunities.\nSimplified Financial Statements\nGrupo Financiero Interacciones\nSimplified Financial Information (\"SFI\")\n1Q18\n4Q17\n1Q17\nVar.vs\n4Q17\n1Q17\nBank - Interest Income\n3,242\n3,027\n2,679\n7.10%\n21.02%\nBank - Interest Expense\n-2,356\n-2,159\n-2,038\n9.12%\n15.60%\nBank's Financial Margin\n886\n868\n641\n2.07%\n38.22%\nProvisions for Loan Losses\n152\n-269\n39\n-156.51%\n289.74%\nNet Commissions\n276\n848\n359\n-67.45%\n-23.12%\nBusiness Commissions\n429\n594\n310\n-27.78%\n38.39%\nTemporary Commissions\n-153\n254\n49\n-160.24%\n-412.24%\nIncome from Brokerage Activities\n142\n22\n100\n545.45%\n42.00%\nOther Operating Income (Expenses)\n10\n-22\n40\n-145.45%\n-75.00%\nIPAB\n-126\n-123\n-120\n2.44%\n5.00%\nAdministrative and Promotional Expenses (\"SG&A\")\n-488\n-599\n-433\n-18.53%\n12.70%\nSubsidiary Result\n-2\n2\n-\n-200.00%\n100.00%\nBank's Income before Income Taxes\n850\n727\n626\n16.92%\n35.78%\nBrokerage Unit's Income before Income Taxes\n156\n73\n153\n113.70%\n1.96%\nInsurance Unit's Income before Income Taxes\n-4\n111\n-24\n-103.60%\n-83.33%\nExtraordinary Items\n-148\n-136\n-\n8.82%\n100.00%\nOther Subsidiary Results\n-11\n-12\n-26\n-8.33%\n-57.69%\nTaxes\n-173\n-96\n-111\n80.21%\n55.86%\nNet Income\n670\n667\n618\n0.45%\n8.41%\n* Millions of pesos\n*Simplified Financial Information (\"SFI\") is adjusted for valuation effects, non-recurring items and includes reclassifications of regulatory financial statements\nMain Indicators - Simplified Financial Information (\"SFI\")\n4Q17\n3Q17\n4Q16\nVar.vs\n3Q17\n4Q16\nMain Financial Ratios\nBank - Loan Portfolio Financial Margin\n3.08%\n3.12%\n2.31%\n-4bp\n76bp\nROE - Bank\n15.76%\n18.22%\n15.20%\n-246bp\n56bp\nROE - GFI\n15.70%\n16.14%\n15.44%\n-44bp\n26bp\nBankÂ´s Efficiency Ratio\n46.73%\n42.07%\n48.51%\n466pb\n-178bp\nNPL Ratio\n0.03%\n0.02%\n0.06%\n1bp\n-3bp\nCoverage Ratio\n39.05x\n62.41x\n23.34x\n-23.4x\n15.71x\n*Millions of pesos\n*Simplified Financial Information (\"SFI\") is adjusted for valuation effects, non-recurring items and includes reclassifications of regulatory financial statements\nThe Bank's financial margin for 1Q18 increased 38.22% YoY and 2.07% QoQ. The YoY change resulted from the positive contribution from GFI's loan book, in addition to a reduction in cost of funds from TIIE minus 5 basis points at 1Q17 to TIIE minus 73 basis points at 1Q18. Infrastructure Banking, not only represented the business unit with the strongest growth but also represented higher yields than other banking units. The QoQ change is mainly explained by the widening of credit spreads relative to the cost of liabilities, in spite of a seasonal sequential contraction in the loan portfolio.\nDuring 1Q18, GFI released Ps.152 million in provisions , mainly as a result to the change in the credit profile of GFI's clients during both time periods, as well as a change in the portfolio mix. It is important to note that this release is also partially reflected in commissions paid during the corresponding periods, which generates a neutralizing effect in earnings.\nNet Commissions decreased 23.12% YoY and 67.45% relative to 4Q17. The YoY change is mainly explained by a 38.39% increase in business commissions reflecting higher demand for Infrastructure products as well as for short term borrowing in the form of factoring structures in the Government business line, as mentioned above; this YoY increase in business commissions was outweighed by a 412.24% decrease in temporary commissions as a result of the 5.92% decrease in the Government loan portfolio and by the 41.88% YoY growth in the Infrastructure loan book, which does not generate temporary commissions.\nThe QoQ change reflects the same dynamics in temporary commissions mentioned above, in addition to a 27.78% decrease in business commissions in line with GFI's intrinsic business model seasonality.\nIncome from Brokerage Activities amounted to Ps.142 million in 1Q18, representing an increase of 42.00% YoY and 545.45% QoQ. These changes are explained by the widening of spreads, as well as from better profit-making opportunities during this time period in the fixed income market.\nOther Operating Income (Expenses) amounted to Ps.10 million in 1Q18, compared to other operating income of Ps.40 million in 1Q17 and a Ps.22 million expense in 4Q17. This line includes changes in Other Real Estate Owned (\"OREO\") and OREO discount adjustments, among others.\nAdministrative and Promotional Expenses (SG&A) increased 12.70% YoY and decreased 18.53% QoQ. The YoY change is mainly driven by a greater origination of infrastructure banking projects, including projects that were deferred from 4Q17 to 1Q18, which require legal services related to their structuring. The QoQ decrease reflects GFI's business model seasonality.\nThe Brokerage Unit reported income before taxes of Ps.156 million in 1Q18, increasing 1.96% YoY and 113.70% QoQ. The YoY increase reflects a 69.05% increase in trading income, which offset the 16.03% decrease in commissions, while the QoQ increase is explained by an 80.51% higher trading income. Both increases in trading income resulted from higher margins in debt trading activities during this time period.\nAseguradora Interacciones , the Insurance unit, reported a loss before taxes of Ps.4 million in 1Q18, compared to a Ps.24 million loss in 1Q17 and a Ps.111 million profit in 4Q17. The YoY change resulted from the alignment of costs to revenues stemming from premiums with lower risk exposures as part of this business unit's strategy. This strategy implied the release of technical reserves as well as lower claims during 1Q18. The QoQ change is explained by a Ps.204 million catastrophic reserve release during 4Q17, in addition to a technical reserve release related with the non-renewal of Property & Casualty businesses with a much higher risk exposure, in line with this business unit's strategy.\nExtraordinary Items regarding the recent transaction with Banorte announced on October 25th, 2017, amounted to Ps.148 million, these expenses reflect legal fees and integration costs.\nGrupo Financiero Interacciones reported net income of Ps.670 million in 1Q18, representing an increase of 8.41% YoY and 0.45% QoQ. The YoY change is mainly explained by an increase of 38.22% in the Bank's financial margin, as well as a 38.39% increase in business commissions, in addition to a 42.00% increase in income from brokerage activities, which more than offset the 12.70% increase in SG&A, as well as the Ps.148 million in extraordinary items mentioned above. The QoQ change reflects an 18.53% decrease in SG&A, a 545.45% increase in income from brokerage activities, and a Ps.83 million increase in the Brokerage Unit's income before taxes, which offset the flat financial margin performance.\nREGULATORY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -
