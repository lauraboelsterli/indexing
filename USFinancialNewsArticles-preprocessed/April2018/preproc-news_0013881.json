    "text": "Ed Weinberg thinks he has developed the best way to stop the toxic blooms of blue-green algae that have been fouling bodies of water from the Florida Everglades to the Great Lakes and beyond.\nThe algae feed on phosphorus from farms and wastewater treatment plants that makes its way into rivers and lakes. Mr. Weinbergâ€™s solution deploys tiny beads of engineered resin that can absorb the mineral from water and extract it for reuse.\n...  ",
