    "text": "April 17, 2018 / 12:03 PM / Updated 8 minutes ago Merkel says Russia shares responsibility for Syria chemical attack Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBERLIN, April 17 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday that Russia, as an ally of the Syrian government, bore joint responsibility for the chemical attack in eastern Ghouta earlier this month but she stressed she still intended to keep talking to President Vladimir Putin. \n“We know that in relation to the poison gas attack in Syria, that Russia, as an ally of (President Bashar al-) Assad has joint responsibility, there is no question about that, but it is nevertheless important to keep talking to Russia,” said Merkel. \nShe was speaking at a news conference with her New Zealand counterpart and added that she expected to meet Putin in the foreseeable future but there was no date yet set.
