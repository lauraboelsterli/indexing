    "text": "GALVESTON, Texas, April 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- American National Insurance Company (Nasdaq:ANAT) announced net income of $18.8 million or $0.70 per diluted share . Net income was reduced by $25.7 million in unrealized losses on equity securities as a result of our adoption of new accounting guidance (1) which impacted the first quarter of 2018 but not the first quarter of 2017. Excluding the impact of these unrealized losses, net income would have been $44.5 million or $1.66 per diluted share as compared to first quarter 2017 net income of $39.8 million or $1.48 per diluted share.\nOperating income increased to $44.1 million or $1.63 per diluted share compared to $28.3 million or $1.05 per diluted share for the same period of 2017. Operating income for the quarter primarily increased as a result of improved earnings from our property and casualty segment due to a lower combined ratio as compared to the same period in 2017. Operating income excludes net unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities and realized investment earnings. Realized investment earnings are comprised of realized investment gains (losses), equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates and income (loss) from non-controlling interests.\nBook value per diluted share was $194.37 as of March 31, 2018 consistent with book value per share of $194.61 on December 31, 2017.\nAfter-tax realized investment earnings were $0.4 million or $0.03 per diluted share compared to earnings of $11.5 million or $0.43 per diluted share for the same period in 2017.\nFirst quarter 2018 Highlights:\nFirst quarter 2018 premiums and other revenues, at $803.4 million, increased $23.6 million, or 3.0%, compared to the first quarter of 2017 After-tax operating income increased $15.7 million, or 55.6% over the prior year quarter Total life insurance in force increased by $1.8 billion to reach $104.9 billion as of March 31, 2018\n(1) Reflects the January 1, 2018 adoption of ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\nAmerican National Insurance Company\nCOMPARATIVE OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS\nCompiled on a GAAP basis ( Preliminary & Unaudited )*\nQuarters Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Revenues $ 803,375,000 $ 779,797,000 After-tax earnings: Operating income ** $ 44,068,000 $ 28,320,000 Net realized and unrealized gains (losses)** (25,291,000 ) 11,520,000 Net income $ 18,777,000 $ 39,840,000 Per diluted share earnings: Operating income ** $ 1.63 $ 1.05 Net realized and unrealized gains (losses)** (0.93 ) 0.43 Net income $ 0.70 $ 1.48 Weighted average number of diluted shares upon which computations are based 26,964,355 26,972,128 As of March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Book value per diluted share $ 194.37 $ 194.61 * Results are preliminary and unaudited.
