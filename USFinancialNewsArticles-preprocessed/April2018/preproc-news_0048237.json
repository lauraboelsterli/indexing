    "text": "Billionaire investor Peter Thiel has agreed to end his pursuit of Gawker.com to avoid a potential lawsuit over his secretly funding litigation that drove the news and gossip blog’s publisher out of business.\nThe agreement between Mr. Thiel, his firm Thiel Capital LLC and an adviser liquidating Gawker Media LLC was filed Wednesday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. The agreement concludes more than a year of legal wrangling over a possible lawsuit and clears the way for a sale of Gawker, which ceased publishing in 2016...
