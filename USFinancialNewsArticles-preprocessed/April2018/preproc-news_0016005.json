A person walks past a French Connection store in London, Britain, 14 March, 2016. REUTERS/Hannah McKay \nShares of the British fashion chain surged 19.8 percent to their highest since Aug. 31, 2016 and were among the top percentage gainers on the London Stock Exchange. \nFrench Connection said it would look to restart paying dividends if the disposal went through and the company returned to profitability. \nThe sale of Toast, known for its Venetian palazzo and pyjamas for women, was in agreement with founders Jamie and Jessica Seaton, who also agreed to sell their 25 percent stake, the company said. \nThe disposal, subject to shareholder approval, will help French Connection focus on its core business and return to profitability, it said. \nFrench Connection has been struggling to fend off competition from fast-fashion rivals such as ASOS ( ASOS.L ), Forever 21 and Inditex’s ( ITX.MC ) Zara. The company has closed stores and hired new management and design teams as it tries to turn the corner. \nIn March, French Connection said it was close to returning to profit. \nFounded in 1997 by the Seatons, French Connection acquired the stake in Toast in 2000. Toast made an operating profit of 1.1 million pounds in the year ended Jan. 31. Reporting by Rahul B in Bengaluru; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier",
