    "text": "Tenfold revenue increase from continuing operations over Q2 2017\nTORONTO, April 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Electrovaya Inc. (“Electrovaya” or the “Company”) (TSX:EFL) (OTCQX:EFLVF) today reported its financial results for the fiscal second quarter ended March 31, 2018 (“Q2 2018”). All numbers are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted.\nThe Company is pleased to report a tenfold increase in revenue from continuing operations in Q2 2018 compared to the fiscal second quarter ended March 31, 2017 (“Q2 2017”). Revenue from continuing operations was US$3.3 million (Cdn $4.2 million), compared to US$0.3 million (Cdn $0.4 million) in Q2 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to revenue collected on the Cdn $4.3 million purchase order from Walmart Canada announced on September 18, 2017, and also included other purchase orders for materials handling electric vehicle (MHEV) batteries.\nElectrovaya is encouraged by continued interest in its lithium ion forklift battery systems from new and existing customers. In addition to the six Fortune 500 companies which have issued initial and/or follow-up purchase orders, validation testing is ongoing by major global companies, and the Company is confident that sales momentum for these products will increase during fiscal 2018. Multiple manufacturers of MHEVs have approved the use of Electrovaya’s lithium ion batteries in certain of their vehicles for the North American market.\nQ2 2018 Financial Highlights\nAll Q2 2018 financial highlights are from continuing operations\nRevenue was $3.3 million (Cdn $4.2 million), up significantly from $0.3 million (Cdn $0.4 million) for Q2 2017. Gross profit was $0.9 million (Cdn $1.1 million) with a gross margin of 28% compared to $0.0 million (Cdn $0.1 million) with gross margin of 14% for Q2 2017. For the six months ended March 31, 2018, revenue was $4.0 million (Cdn $5.1 million) and gross profit was $1.2 million (Cdn $1.5 million), while revenue and gross profit were $1.1 million (Cdn $1.4 million) and $0.7 million (Cdn $0.9 million), respectively, for the six months ended March 31, 2017. Net loss was $2.7 million (Cdn $3.4 million) compared to $0.5 million (Cdn $0.6 million) for Q2 2017. The increased loss was primarily due to a $2.4 million increase in general and administrative expenses from Q2 2017 to Q2 2018, resulting from approximately $0.4 million in legal and professional fees primarily relating to the structured insolvency proceedings for the Company’s German subsidiary in Q2 2018, and a reimbursement of expenses without the corresponding inclusion of the discontinued operations expenses in Q2 2017. Cash and equivalents were $2.0 million as at March 31, 2018. On January 25, 2018, the Company’s wholly owned German subsidiary commenced a voluntary structured insolvency process. An administrator has been appointed who has engaged a merger and acquisition specialist to conduct an orderly sale process. The Company has determined that it is no longer necessary to own unprofitable subsidiaries carrying out component production of electrodes and separators when alternate customized supply chain arrangements are available.\nQ2 2018 Business Highlights\nElectrovaya continued commissioning of MHEVs on the Cdn $4.3 million purchase order from Walmart Canada. Walmart is converting all the forklifts at one of its Ontario distribution centers from lead acid batteries to Electrovaya’s lithium ion batteries. The Company believes this is the single largest installation of materials handling vehicles powered by lithium ion batteries in North America.\nDuring the quarter, Electrovaya announced purchase orders for its lithium ion battery systems from three major global companies, including two U.S. Fortune 500 companies. In addition, multiple manufacturers of MHEVs have approved the use of Electrovaya’s lithium ion batteries in certain of their vehicles for the North American market.\nOn March 29, 2018, two new directors, Dr. James K. Jacobs and Mr. Suresh Madan were elected to the Company’s Board of Directors at its Annual and Special Meeting. Dr. Jacobs co-founded Electrovaya in 1996. He welcomed the opportunity to re-join Electrovaya’s Board as he is excited about recent advancements in the Company’s battery technology and the potential for significant sales growth. Mr. Madan is currently President and CEO of MyHealth Centre, which operates a chain of more than 30 diagnostic health facilities across Ontario. Mr. Madan brings deep financial knowledge and business skills to the Company.\nSubsequent to Q2 2018, Electrovaya attended the MODEX conference in Atlanta, Georgia from April 9-12. MODEX is the leading manufacturing and supply chain expo in the United States. In addition, Electrovaya’s batteries are on display at the CeMAT logistics and supply chain conference in Hannover, Germany, which runs from April 23-27. The batteries are integrated in multiple trucks of a leading materials handling vehicle manufacturer.\nIt is estimated by the Worldwide Industrial Truck Statistics 1 that approximately 281,000 materials handling vehicles were sold in North America, and about 1.1 million globally, during 2016. In the United States, about 65.5% (~185,000) were electric vehicles, mostly powered by lead acid batteries. By comparison, approximately 200,000 electric cars (battery and plug-in electric vehicles) 2 were sold in the United States in 2017, mostly powered by lithium ion batteries. Typically, a lithium ion battery powering an intensive-use MHEV could work ten times longer than batteries for electric cars and must have the ability to be charged rapidly and cycled multiple times per day. Thus, MHEV battery requirements are substantially more demanding than those required for electric cars, and the MHEV batteries are expected to deliver superior value to the logistics and materials handling user.\n1 WITS as reported in Modern Material Handling (MMH) magazine, Dec 6, 2017\n2 https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/01/2017-was-the-best-year-ever-for-electric-vehicle-sales-in-the-us\nThe Company’s complete Q2 2018 Financial Statements and Management Discussion and Analysis are available at www.sedar.com or on the Company’s website at www.electrovaya.com .\nConference Call Details:\nThe Company will hold a conference call on Wednesday, April 25, 2018 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) to discuss the Q2 2018 financial results and to provide a business update.\nConference ID: 13679391\nUS and Canada toll free: (807) 407-8291\nInternational: +1 (201) 689-8345\nTo help ensure that the conference begins in a timely manner, please dial in 10 minutes prior to the start of the call.\nFor those unable to participate in the conference call, a replay will be available for two weeks beginning on April 25, 2018 through May 9, 2018.
