    "text": "0 COMMENTS Retirees often underestimate their future spending, writes Neal Templin .\nNavigating retirement can be difficult for lots of reasons. One of the biggest is that it forces people to make plans based on spending assumptions that won’t become a reality for decades. Guessing wrong can be the difference between a comfortable retirement and one that is a struggle.\nFinancial advisers say some of the most frequent mistakes people make when estimating how much they’ll need for retirement include how much they can help out family, paying for big-ticket items like cars or home repairs, and health care.\nBelow, some of the best analysis and insight from WSJ writers and columnists, and occasionally beyond, on investing, the wealth-management business and more.\nTALKING POINTS \nThe Trophy Homes Linked to Chinese Conglomerate HNA Group: As Chinese conglomerate HNA Group works to raise capital, its executives and a company headed by the CEO’s brother own trophy homes throughout metro New York , including four pricey residences at One57.\nPLANNING & INVESTING \nWhy Volatile Markets Are Good News for Careful Investors: February’s selloff and subsequent turbulence have restored some normality.\nCryptocurrency Firms, Investors Seek Exemption From SEC Oversight: Andreessen Horowitz and other venture-capital backers of digital-currency firms lobby regulators.\nBUSINESS & PRACTICE \nRobo Adviser Wealthfront Cuts a Fee to Appease Angry Investors: The firm plans to cut the fee on a new investment product that led some clients and consumer advocates to question its commitment to a low-cost model .\nSEC Votes to Propose Stricter Broker Standards: The commission’s Democrats blast the plan as weak and likely to maintain the status quo.\nTRAVEL & LIFESTYLE \nSurreal Los Angeles: Touring the City’s Strangest Museums: In Los Angeles, a city unfettered by tradition and well-versed in whimsy, oddball museums flourish .\n$$$ \nThe WSJ Wealth Adviser Briefing covers topics of interest to wealth managers, financial planners and other advisers. It’s delivered to subscribers by email each workday morning; you can sign up for email delivery here: http://on.wsj.com/WealthAdviserSignup. \nFollow WSJ Personal Finance on Twitter: @WSJpersfinance \nShare this: wealth adviser Previous Goldman’s Unconvincing Defense of Active Fund Managers Next All Eyes on OPEC Meeting in Jeddah—Energy Journal",
