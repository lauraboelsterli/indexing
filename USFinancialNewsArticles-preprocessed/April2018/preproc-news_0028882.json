    "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Dwayne Johnson's arcade game-inspired \"Rampage\" crept past last week's top film \"A Quiet Place\" to take the No. 1 spot on the box office charts, but just barely.\nStudios on Sunday estimate that \"Rampage\" has grossed $34.5 million in its first weekend in theaters. In a very close second was the modestly-budgeted John Krasinski thriller \"A Quiet Place\" with $32.6 million. In just two weeks, the word-of-mouth sensation is now just shy of $100 million in grosses from North American theaters.\nThird place went to the low-budget Blumhouse horror \"Truth or Dare,\" which brought in an estimated $19.1 million in its first three days in theaters after a Friday the 13th opening.",
