    "text": "April 2, 2018 / 8:41 PM / Updated 8 minutes ago Exclusive: CBS plans all-stock bid for Viacom below current valuation - sources Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - CBS Corp ( CBS.N ) plans to make an all-stock offer for Viacom that values the U.S. media company at below its current market valuation, people familiar with the matter said on Monday, indicating tough negotiations lie ahead. FILE PHOTO: The CBS television network logo is seen outside their offices on 6th avenue in New York, U.S. on May 19, 2016. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo/File Photo \nAs part of its initial offer to be submitted in the next few days, CBS chief executive Leslie Moonves will propose to stay at the helm for at least two years if the U.S. media companyâ€™s bid to merge with peer Viacom Inc ( VIAB.O ) is accepted, according to the sources. \nThe sources wished to remain anonymous because they are not permitted to speak to the media. \nCBS and Viacom declined to comment.
