    "text": "Erik Haula scored at the 15:22 mark in the second overtime to give the Vegas Golden Knights a 2-1 victory over the Los Angeles Kings and a 2-0 lead in the Western Conference first-round series of the Stanley Cup playoffs on Friday night at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.\nHaula took a pass from James Neal inside the blue line and then came in alone on the right side of the net, where he deked Kings goalie Jonathan Quick and fired a shot through his pads for his seventh career playoff goal.\nThe game was the longest ever played by a team in its inaugural season, and the longest in Kings franchise history.\nMarc-Andre Fleury had 29 saves and Alex Tuch scored his first career playoff goal for Vegas. It was the 64th career playoff victory for Fleury, which moved him past Curtis Joseph into 12th place for all-time playoff wins.\nQuick was brilliant, finishing with a career-high 54 saves for the Kings, who played without Norris Trophy contending defenseman Drew Doughty. Doughty was suspended for one game by the NHL’s Department of Player Safety on Thursday for a Game 1 hit to the head of Vegas forward William Carrier, who did not play Friday.\nPaul LaDue scored for Los Angeles, which fell to 29-28 all-time in Stanley Cup playoff overtime games.\nThe Golden Knights, who entered the contest 0-for-16 on the power play in their five games against the Kings, ended that streak in the first period with a little help from the dasher boards. With Kyle Clifford in the penalty box for goalie interference, Vegas took a 1-0 lead when Jonathan Marchessault’s shot from the high slot caromed off the boards straight to Tuch, who easily slapped in the rebound past Quick’s glove side.\nIt marked just the second power-play goal allowed in 13 games by Los Angeles, which led the NHL in penalty-kill percentage.\nLaDue tied it with a power-play goal at the 15:55 mark of the second period with his first career playoff goal, firing a shot from the right point that glanced off the leg of Vegas defenseman Deryk Engelland in front of the net and past Fleury, ending a shutout streak of 95:55 by the Golden Knights’ goalie.\nThe series now moves to the Staples Center in Los Angeles for the next two games, with Game 3 set for Sunday night.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
