    "text": "The U.S. government on Monday gave American customers of Russia's biggest aluminum producer more time to comply with sanctions, sending aluminum prices into a tailspin but lifting shares of the company, United Company Rusal .\nAluminum prices on the London Metal Exchange tumbled more than 8 percent after the U.S. Treasury Department announcement, which gives Rusal longer to sell off the large quantities of aluminum it had been stockpiling in the wake of sanctions as customers and traders avoided its product.\nShares in Rusal, one of the world's largest aluminum companies, rose 13 percent on the Moscow Exchange after the announcement. Earlier, Rusal had ended Hong Kong trading down 8.4 percent. Shares of its U.S. rival Alcoa slid 13 percent in morning trading .\nRusal and its major shareholder, Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska, were sanctioned by Washington in response to what it called \"malign activities\" by Russia. The Treasury Department said the United States could provide sanctions relief if Deripaska ceded control of the company.",
