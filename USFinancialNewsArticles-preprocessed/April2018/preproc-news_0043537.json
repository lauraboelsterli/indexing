    "text": "NEW YORK, April 19 (Reuters) - Wall Street’s three major indexes declined on Thursday with tobacco stocks leading a tumble in consumer staples while concerns about smartphone demand hurt the technology sector and rising bond yields and earnings helped financials rebound.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 83.4 points, or 0.34 percent, to 24,664.67, the S&P 500 lost 15.51 points, or 0.57 percent, to 2,693.13 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 57.18 points, or 0.78 percent, to 7,238.06.
