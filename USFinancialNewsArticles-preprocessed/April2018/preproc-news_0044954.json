    "text": "(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) is close to settling a record fine of $1 billion imposed by two U.S. regulators for its risk management business, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.\nLast week, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) proposed Wells Fargo to pay the penalty to resolve probes into auto insurance and mortgage lending abuses at the third largest U.S. bank.\nWells Fargo declined to comment.\nThe CFPB had been readying sanctions alongside the OCC, Wells Fargo's day-to-day regulator. reut.rs/2IGwTwi\nA Wells Fargo logo is seen in New York City, U.S. January 10, 2017. REUTERS/Stephanie Keith The bank, still smarting from a prolonged sales scandal in its retail banking business, found inconsistencies at its auto lending and mortgage in the summer of 2017, leading to further probes by regulators.\nTo appease investors and regulators, the bank overhauled its operational structure, shook up its board and hired a new compliance officer.\nReporting by Patrick Rucker in Washington and Mekhla Raina in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur\n ",
