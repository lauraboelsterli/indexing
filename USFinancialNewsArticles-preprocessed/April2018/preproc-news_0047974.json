It’s clear that our strategy to accelerate profitable growth, both organically and through accretive acquisitions, is working.\n“As we move through 2018, we expect operating profit margin improvement to accelerate as organic initiatives gain momentum, and as we achieve further growth from the six acquisitions we completed last year. We expect increased profit growth in the second half from normal seasonality and the addition of the Rodoban acquisition in Brazil. We also remain committed to driving additional growth by pursuing synergistic acquisitions. Including our pending $145 million investment in Rodoban, we expect to invest approximately $800 million in new acquisitions between now and the end of 2019.”\nFirst-quarter non-GAAP operating profit increased 34% despite higher corporate expenses due in part to increased security-related costs that are expected to decline in subsequent quarters. Earnings were affected by a higher tax rate and higher interest costs related primarily to borrowings to support completed and potential acquisitions.\nBrink’s affirmed its 2018 non-GAAP guidance, which includes revenue growth of 8% to approximately $3.45 billion, operating profit growth of at least 30% to a range between $365 million and $385 million, earnings growth to a range between $3.65 and $3.85 per share, and adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately $100 million to a range between $515 million and $535 million. For 2019, Brink’s continues to target $625 million of adjusted EBITDA.\nThe company’s 2018 guidance and 2019 adjusted EBITDA target assume annual organic revenue growth of approximately 5%, supplemented by contributions from the six acquisitions closed in 2017 and from Rodoban, which is expected to close around mid-year. Upon completion of the Rodoban acquisition, total expenditures on acquisitions since March 2017 will be approximately $510 million. These acquisitions are expected to generate adjusted EBITDA of $60 million to $70 million in 2018 and approximately $90 million with synergies through 2019, reflecting an average post-synergy purchase multiple of less than six.\nConference Call\nBrink’s will host a conference call on April 25 at 8:30 a.m. ET to review first-quarter results.

The 2018 Non-GAAP outlook amounts for operating profit and nonoperating expense exclude the impact of other items not allocated to segments and certain retirement plan costs. The 2018 Non-GAAP outlook amounts for provision for income taxes, noncontrolling interests, income from continuing operations, EPS from continuing operations, effective income tax rate and Adjusted EBITDA cannot be reconciled to GAAP without unreasonable effort. We cannot reconcile these amounts to GAAP because we are unable to accurately forecast the tax impact of Venezuela operations and the related exchange rates used to measure those operations.\n(b) 2018 GAAP outlook includes the actual impact of Venezuela operations through March 31, 2018, but does not include any forecasted amounts from Venezuela operations for the remainder of 2018. The 2018 GAAP outlook excludes future restructuring actions for which the timing and amount are currently under review.\n(c) Non-GAAP amounts include the impact of prior year comparable period results for acquired and disposed businesses.

See below for a summary of the other items not allocated to segments.\nVenezuela operations We have excluded from our segment results all of our Venezuela operating results, due to the Venezuelan government's restrictions that have prevented us from repatriating funds. As a result, the Chief Executive Officer, the Company's Chief Operating Decision maker (\"CODM\"), assesses segment performance and makes resource decisions by segment excluding Venezuela operating results.\nReorganization and Restructuring\n2016 Restructuring\nIn the fourth quarter of 2016, management implemented restructuring actions across our global business operations and our corporate functions. As a result of these actions, we recognized $18.1 million in related 2016 costs, an additional $17.3 million in 2017 and $2.7 million in the first three months of 2018. We expect to incur additional costs between $7 and $9 million in future periods, primarily severance costs.\nOther Restructurings\nManagement routinely implements restructuring actions in targeted sections of our business. As a result of these actions, we recognized $1.0 million in the first three months of 2018, primarily severance costs. For the current restructuring actions, we expect to incur additional costs between $1 and $3 million in future periods.\nDue to the unique circumstances around these charges, these management-directed items have not been allocated to segment results and are excluded from non-GAAP results.\nAcquisitions and dispositions Certain acquisition and disposition items that are not considered part of the ongoing activities of the business and are special in nature are consistently excluded from non-GAAP results. These items are described below:\n2018 Acquisitions and Dispositions\nAmortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets was $3.8 million in the first three months of 2018. Severance costs related to our 2017 acquisitions in Argentina, France and Brazil were $2.1 million in the first three months of 2018. Transaction costs related to business acquisitions was $0.5 million in the first three months of 2018.\n2017 Acquisitions and Dispositions\nAmortization expense for acquisition-related intangible assets was $8.4 million in 2017. Fourth quarter 2017 gain of $7.8 million related to the sale of real estate in Mexico. Severance costs of $4.0 million related to our recent acquisitions in Argentina and Brazil. Transaction costs of $2.6 million related to acquisitions of new businesses in 2017. Currency transaction gains of $1.8 million related to acquisition activity.\nThe Brink’s Company and subsidiaries\nNon-GAAP Results Reconciled to GAAP (Unaudited)\n(In millions, except for percentages and per share amounts)\nNon-GAAP results described in this press release are financial measures that are not required by or presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). The purpose of the Non-GAAP results is to report financial information from the primary operations of our business by excluding the effects of certain income and expenses that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations. The specific items excluded have not been allocated to segments, are described on page 7 and in more detail in our Form 10-Q, and are reconciled to comparable GAAP measures below.\nNon-GAAP results adjust the quarterly Non-GAAP tax rates so that the Non-GAAP tax rate in each of the quarters is equal to the full-year estimated Non-GAAP tax rate. The full-year Non-GAAP tax rate in both years excludes certain pretax and income tax amounts. Amounts reported for prior periods have been updated in this report to present information consistently for all periods presented.\nThe 2018 Non-GAAP outlook amounts for provision for income taxes, income (loss) from continuing operations, EPS from continuing operations, effective income tax rate and Adjusted EBITDA cannot be reconciled to GAAP without unreasonable effort. We cannot reconcile these amounts to GAAP because we are unable to accurately forecast the tax impact of Venezuela operations and the related exchange rates used to measure those operations. The impact of Venezuela operations and related exchange rates during the remainder of 2018 could be significant to our full-year GAAP provision for income taxes, and, therefore, to income (loss) from continuing operations, EPS from continuing operations, effective income tax rate and Adjusted EBITDA.\nThe Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide investors with a supplemental comparison of our operating results and trends for the periods presented. Our management believes these measures are also useful to investors as such measures allow investors to evaluate our performance using the same metrics that our management uses to evaluate past performance and prospects for future performance. We do not consider these items to be reflective of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period-to-period in terms of size, nature and significance. Additionally, non-GAAP results are utilized as performance measures in certain management incentive compensation plans.\nNon-GAAP Results Reconciled to GAAP\nYTD '17 YTD '18 Pre-tax Tax Effective\ntax rate Pre-tax Tax Effective\ntax rate Effective Income Tax Rate GAAP $ 54.9 14.4 26.2 % $ 36.7 11.4 31.1 % Retirement plans (c) 7.3 2.7 8.8 1.9 Venezuela operations (a) (18.2 ) (4.9 ) (1.6 ) (1.5 ) Reorganization and Restructuring (a) 4.1 1.4 3.7 1.2 Acquisitions and dispositions (a) (0.4 ) 0.2 9.6 3.1 Tax on accelerated income (g) — — — 0.5 Income tax rate adjustment (b) — 2.5 — 4.6 Non-GAAP $ 47.7 16.3 34.2 % $ 57.2 21.2 37.0 % Amounts may not add due to rounding.\n(a) See “Other Items Not Allocated To Segments” on pages 6-7 for details. We do not consider these items to be reflective of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period-to-period in terms of size, nature and significance.\n(b) Non-GAAP income from continuing operations and non-GAAP EPS have been adjusted to reflect an effective income tax rate in each interim period equal to the full-year non-GAAP effective income tax rate. The full-year non-GAAP effective tax rate is estimated at 37.0% for 2018 and was 34.2% for 2017.\n(c) Our U.S. retirement plans are frozen and costs related to these plans are excluded from non-GAAP results. Certain non-U.S. operations also have retirement plans. Settlement charges related to these non-U.S. plans are also excluded from non-GAAP results.\n(d) Penalties upon prepayment of Private Placement notes in September 2017 and a term loan in October 2017.\n(e) Related to an unfavorable court ruling in the third quarter of 2017 on a non-income tax claim in Brazil. The court ruled that Brink's must pay interest accruing from the initial claim filing in 1994 to the current date. The principal amount of the claim was approximately $1 million and was recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses in the third quarter of 2017.\n(f) Represents the estimated impact of tax legislation enacted into law in the fourth quarter of 2017. This primarily relates to the U.S. Tax Reform expense from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets.\n(g) The non-GAAP tax rate excludes the 2018 and 2017 foreign tax benefits that resulted from the transaction that accelerated U.S. tax in 2015.\n(h) There is no difference between GAAP and non-GAAP share-based compensation amounts for the periods presented.\n(i) Adjusted EBITDA is defined as non-GAAP income from continuing operations excluding the impact of non-GAAP interest expense, non-GAAP income tax provision, non-GAAP depreciation and amortization and non-GAAP share-based compensation.\n(j) Because we reported a loss from continuing operations on a GAAP basis in the fourth quarter of 2017, GAAP EPS was calculated using basic shares. However, as we reported income from continuing operations on a non-GAAP basis in the fourth quarter of 2017, non-GAAP EPS was calculated using diluted shares.\nThe Brink’s Company and subsidiaries\nNon-GAAP Results Reconciled to GAAP (Unaudited) -
