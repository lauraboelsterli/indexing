    "text": "274 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—A Senate panel on Thursday overwhelmingly approved a bill that would protect special counsel Robert Mueller from being fired without cause, in a bipartisan show of support for the ongoing investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nSerious political and legal hurdles stand in the way of it becoming law. The bill, authored by two Democrats and two Republicans , would enshrine into law a Justice Department guideline that a special counsel can’t be fired without cause. In addition, it would give special counsels a 10-day window to challenge a dismissal in federal court.\nThe proposal, which passed the Senate Judiciary Committee 14 to 7, is the result of weeks of negotiations between Republicans and Democrats on the panel and is the first major congressional activity to protect Mr. Mueller’s probe. Four Republicans joined all of the panel’s Democrats in supporting the measure.\nThe measure would also require special counsels to report to Congress at the end of their investigations.\nJudiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), who supported the bill, said he had some concerns about its constitutionality but believed it was important for Congress to ensure special counsel investigations were conducted with integrity and free from political inference.\n“Because special counsel investigations only occur where there is a conflict of interest within the executive branch, special counsel investigations are usually matters of great national concern,” he said. “And Congress, by exercising its oversight powers, can help the American people to have confidence that these investigations are conducted efficiently and independently.”\nRelated Video On Monday President Trump called the raids at the office of his lawyer, Michael Cohen, a \"disgrace\" and a \"witch hunt\" and discussed the possibility of firing special counsel Robert Mueller. Photo: Getty.(Originally Published April 10, 2018) There is limited appetite among Republican leadership for the measure, with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saying he doesn’t plan to bring it to the floor for a vote. Even if the proposed legislation could attract bipartisan support in the House and Senate, it would still face a likely presidential veto.\nThe bill was authored by Sens. Cory Booker (D., N.J.), Lindsey Graham (R, S.C.), Chris Coons (D., Del.) and Thom Tillis (R., N.C.) in response to concerns that President Donald Trump will dismiss Mr. Mueller, who is conducting a wide-ranging criminal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\nThe two Republican authors of the bill said their support of the measure had nothing to do with Mr. Mueller’s investigation but was intended to establish a long-term precedent to protect the independence of special counsels.\n“Our bill isn’t about Mueller,” said Mr. Tillis. “I’m looking forward to 12 years from now, 16 years from now, when maybe we have a similar circumstance.”\nMr. Mueller also is investigating possible collusion by Trump campaign aides with Moscow and whether the president sought to obstruct justice in the Justice Department’s probe. Moscow has denied meddling in the election.\nMr. Trump has repeatedly called the investigation a “witch hunt ,” asserting there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia. The investigation has ensnared several of Mr. Trump’s close aides , resulting in guilty pleas or criminal indictments of two top campaign officials and his former national security adviser and several others.\nOn Thursday morning before the measure passed the committee, Mr. Trump said he had decided he wouldn’t “be involved” in the Justice Department, presumably referring to Mr. Mueller’s probe. But, he added, “I may change my mind at some point.”\nRepublican leaders on Capitol Hill have said Mr. Mueller’s work should be allowed to continue unimpeded but have stopped short of endorsing any legislative measures to protect the special counsel. Mr. McConnell told Fox Business this month that such legislation was “not necessary.” House Speaker Paul Ryan said last month that he had received “assurances” Mr. Mueller wouldn’t be fired.\nOther Republicans and legal scholars have expressed concerns about the constitutionality of the proposal, questioning whether Congress has the authority to tell a president which subordinates may be fired.\nNewsletter Sign-up “Firing Mueller would cause a firestorm and bring the administration’s agenda to a halt. It could even result in impeachment,” said Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican. But, he added about the bill that advanced Thursday: “I cannot support it because I believe the bill is unconstitutional.”\nHis view is shared by some, but not all, legal scholars. In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year on draft versions of the legislation, Yale law professor Akhil Reed Amar —who described himself as a registered Democrat and has publicly criticized Mr. Trump—said the bills were well-intentioned but would likely be struck down by the current Supreme Court.\n“As a scholar who has studied the Constitution for over 30 years and written extensively on constitutional law, I believe that the bills in their current form are unwise and unconstitutional,” Mr. Amar said in testimony to the panel.\nThe Supreme Court in 1988 upheld a similar law aimed at upholding prosecutorial independence in a landmark case called Morrison v. Olson. In that case, the court affirmed that Congress could create an independent counsel to investigate executive-branch malfeasance who couldn’t be easily dismissed by the president. Only one justice, Antonin Scalia, dissented from that opinion, writing that the existence of such a prosecutor “deprives the President of exclusive control over that quintessentially executive activity.”\nThe independent-counsel law, which, in 1978, created the special prosecutor post, was allowed to expire in 1999—in part over a bipartisan recognition that independent counsels had grown too powerful and weren’t accountable or answerable to any authority. Instead, the Justice Department created rules for “special counsels” that are more tightly controlled by the attorney general.\n—Kristina Peterson contributed to this article.\nWrite to Byron Tau at byron.tau@wsj.com",
