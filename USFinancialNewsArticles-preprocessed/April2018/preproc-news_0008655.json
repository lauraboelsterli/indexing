    "text": "April 5, 2018 / 7:49 AM / Updated 6 hours ago Daily Briefing: Signs of a spring thaw are hard to find Noah Barkin , Mike Dolan 8 Min Read \nBERLIN (Reuters) - Those hoping for a sharp rebound in German industrial orders in February, after a steep decline to start the year, came away disappointed this morning. FILE PHOTO: Snow is seen in front of container terminals in the port of Hamburg, Germany, February 27, 2018 \nOrders bounced back by a meagre 0.3 percent month-on-month , suggesting one of two things: that a long winter and virulent flu bug is depressing the data or that Europe's economic engine is losing a bit of steam. Looming industrial output and trade figures will be closely watched for signs of whether this is a seasonal blip or something more lasting. “The League must decide which side it’s on: whether it wants to help 5-Star change the country, or whether it wants to stay anchored to the past and to Silvio Berlusconi, a man who had a chance to change Italy and didn’t” Luigi Di Maio, leader of 5-Star \nEuropean politics isn’t looking any simpler, either. Italian President Sergio Mattarella will hold a second day of talks today to try to cobble together a government from the mess of Italy's inconclusive March election. But a real breakthrough may take months. \nMeanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron looks to be facing his first robust test from unions angry over his push to reform state-owned railway SNCF and the special privileges enjoyed by its workers. \nTo the east, Europe’s problem child Viktor Orban appears to be cruising towards a third-term in a Hungarian election on Sunday. A poll released on Wednesday predicted that his Fidesz party would win 142 of 199 seats in parliament, giving him a comfortable two-thirds majority. Later today, a U.N. committee in Geneva will issue a judgment on Hungary’s human right record under Orban. \nAll of this is playing out as an extremely tight window for Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to reach a consensus on a reform of the European Union and euro zone narrows. \nThe standoff with Russia also rumbles on. Sources in Washington say the United States plans to sanction Russian oligarchs this week over alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, a step Britain’s Theresa May has so far avoided taking in response to the Salisbury attack . \nExpect the sabre-rattling to continue. On Wednesday, Russia began live fire drills in the Baltic Sea in what Latvia’s prime minister described as a \"demonstration of force\". \nMARKETS \nNot for the first time in recent years, what world markets didn't do is the most interesting issue as the starting gun on an all-out Sino-U.S. trade war appeared to be fired on Wednesday. Members of the Italian elite military unit Cuirassiers' Regiment, who are honour guards for President Sergio Mattarella, stand guard during the first day of consultations at the Quirinal Palace in Rome, April 4, 2018 \nChina’s swift retaliation for U.S. trade tariffs did not have the cratering effect on either Wall Street or global equity markets that seemed likely as Beijing proposed duties on a range of U.S. imports from soya beans to airplanes. \nAfter a early dive, major U.S. equity indexes all rallied to close more than 1 percent higher on the day as White House officials indicated that negotiations were now in order with both sides’ cards on the table. Hopes that the trade salvos of the past few weeks were tactical rather than the beginning of an escalating world trade conflagration has buoyed markets to some degree – though the next steps are now crucial. \nInvestors reckon the impact on world growth and earnings will still be limited unless the United States ups the ante, and to some degree the near 10 percent retreat in MSCI world equities since January peaks has priced in what we’ve seen so far. What’s more, there may be a couple months now of reviews of the measures and some “cooling off” period. \nMarket eyes are also drifting to the upcoming first-quarter U.S. earnings season, which – thanks largely to sweeping tax cuts – could see aggregate annual S&P500 profit growth coming in at close to 20 percent. \nSignificantly for momentum traders, the S&P’s late rally on Wednesday also saw the index close back above its 200-day moving average and the Vix volatility index retreated back nearer to 20 percent. Above-forecast U.S. private-sector job readings for March, released on Wednesday, were also on the radar as the monthly payrolls report is due tomorrow. \nThe Shanghai and Hong Kong markets were closed for a holiday, but the rest of Asia bourses rose smartly. Tokyo and Seoul benchmarks closed more than 1 percent higher, with Singapore’s main index up 2 percent. S&P stock futures have held their gains overnight and are up 0.4 percent. European stock markets are expected to jump more than 1 percent at the open, too. \nAnd so much of the trading activity may now be concentrated on stock-to-stock and sector-to-sector winners and losers rather than overall macro-economic shocks that hit benchmark indices, currencies and bond markets. Traders have been poring over the effects of the measures on Boeing versus Airbus or Adidas versus Nike, not to mention the relative impact on European and U.S. automakers and the drop in commodity prices such as soya beans. \nU.S. Treasury yields and the dollar have pushed higher on the stock market relief overnight, with dollar/yen setting its highest level in three weeks. The fact that Chinese officials said they had not considered any changes to their foreign currency reserve management as part of the trade row was seen as boon to the dollar. \nBack in Europe, the euro was a touch lower with another set of sub-forecast German industry orders for February. Market anxiety about a disappointing stream of euro area economies numbers is mounting – with Citi’s economic surprise index for the bloc now at its most negative since 2013. \n— A look at the day ahead from special correspondent for Europe Noah Barkin and EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan.
