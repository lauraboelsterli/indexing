We have found some things we need to improve and from now on, we will try to prepare well for next year in France.” \nSouth Korea and the Philippines finished third in their respective groups at the eight-team Asian continental championship, which doubles up as the region’s final qualifier for France 2019. \nJapan, Australia, China and Thailand had already advanced by reaching the last four in Jordan, with the semi-finals of the Asian tournament taking place on Tuesday ahead of the title decider on Friday.
