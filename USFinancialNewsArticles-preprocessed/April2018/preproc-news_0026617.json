LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) GX Nifty nearest-month futures at 10,494.50, up 0.25 percent from its previous close. The Indian rupee is likely to edge lower against the dollar as President Donald Trump's comment eased fears of an imminent military strike on Syria, renewing demand for the greenback. Indian government bonds are likely to edge higher in early trade as the nation’s key inflation rate fell to a five-month low in March. The yield on the benchmark 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 may trade in a 7.42 percent-7.48 percent band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • U.S. stocks climbed on Thursday as investors anticipated a strong earnings season and as U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion that a military strike on Syria may not be imminent ratcheted down geopolitical worries. • Global stocks recovered to three-week highs as anticipated strong earnings season took centre stage after U.S. President Donald Trump backtracked on his suggestion of an imminent missile attack on Syria. • The dollar firmed against its peers, supported as an improvement in investor risk appetite lifted equities and pushed U.S. yields significantly higher. • U.S. Treasury yields climbed on Thursday as risk appetite improved and geopolitical tensions eased after President Donald Trump said a possible attack on Syria may not be imminent, contrary to what he signaled on Wednesday. • Oil prices edged lower but are set for their biggest weekly gains since last July following a jump to a more than three-year high earlier in the week on tensions over Syria and shrinking global oil inventories. • Gold edged up after posting its biggest percentage fall in over two weeks in the previous session, and was set to post a small gain for a second week running amid tensions over Syria and a U.S.-China trade stand-off.
