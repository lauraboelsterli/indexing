    "text": "Sales increase 62% year-over-year (5% organically) Earnings per share increase 13%\nCEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rockwell Collins, Inc. (NYSE: COL) today reported sales for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 of $2.180 billion, a 62% increase from the same period in fiscal year 2017, or 5% organic growth excluding $776 million of revenue from the acquisition of B/E Aerospace. Second quarter fiscal year 2018 earnings per share was $1.43 compared to $1.27 in the prior year's second quarter. Adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 was $1.81 compared to $1.39 in the prior year's second quarter (see the supplemental schedule in this press release for a reconciliation between GAAP earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share).\n\"Our strong performance in the first half of 2018 is underscored by another quarter of robust revenue and earnings growth,\" said Rockwell Collins Chief Executive Officer and President, Kelly Ortberg. \"Our plan for the year is playing out as we expected, with commercial aftermarket strength, higher business jet utilization, and an improved defense budget environment driving our growth and more than offsetting the anticipated completion of nuclear security mandate-related sales in our Information Management Services business.\"\nFollowing is a discussion of fiscal year 2018 second quarter sales and earnings for each business segment.\nCommercial Systems\nCommercial Systems, which provides aviation electronics systems, products and services to air transport, business and regional aircraft manufacturers and airlines worldwide, achieved 2018 second quarter results as summarized below.\n(dollars in millions) Q2 FY 18 Q2 FY 17 Inc/(Dec) Commercial Systems sales Original equipment $ 355 $ 337 5 % Aftermarket 285 253 13 % Wide-body in-flight entertainment 4 4 â€” % Total Commercial Systems sales $ 644 $ 594 8 % Operating earnings $ 151 $ 132 14 % Operating margin rate 23.4 % 22.2 % 120 bps Original equipment sales increased due to higher business jet equipment deliveries as well as higher Boeing 737 production rates, partially offset by lower customer-funded development program revenues. Aftermarket sales increased due to higher spares provisioning, service and support activity, regulatory mandate upgrade activity, and used aircraft equipment sales. Commercial Systems operating earnings increased $19 million and operating margin increased 120 basis points over the prior year due to increased earnings from higher sales volume and favorable sales mix, as higher margin equipment and aftermarket sales increased and lower margin customer-funded development revenues decreased, partially offset by higher company-funded R&D expense and higher pre-production engineering amortization.\nInterior Systems\nOur Interior Systems segment was created with the acquisition of B/E Aerospace on April 13, 2017. Interior Systems supplies a comprehensive portfolio of cabin interior products and services to aircraft manufacturers and airlines worldwide. Beginning in 2018, thermal and electronic systems product lines previously included in Interior products and services within the Interior Systems segment are now being reported in the Government Systems segment. See the supplemental schedule included in this press release for revised fiscal year 2017 quarterly sales that conform to the current presentation. Results from the second quarter of 2018 are summarized below.\n(dollars in millions) Q2 FY 18 Interior Systems sales Interior products and services $ 370 Aircraft seating 331 Total Interior Systems sales $ 701 Operating earnings $ 105 Operating margin rate 15.0 % Interior Systems contributed $701 million of sales and $105 million of operating earnings to the second quarter of 2018. Interior Systems operating earnings for the second quarter of 2018 includes $57 million of intangible asset amortization expense partially offset by $38 million of income from the amortization of acquired contract liabilities.\nOn a pro-forma basis, excluding the product lines now reported in Government Systems referenced above, sales for Interior Systems increased 9% in the second quarter compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in pro-forma sales was primarily attributable to increased original equipment deliveries of oxygen systems, galleys and galley inserts across multiple platforms, as well as the timing of linefit seating deliveries, partially offset by a decline in super first class seating sales.\nGovernment Systems\nGovernment Systems provides a broad range of electronic products, systems and services to customers including the U.S. Department of Defense, other government agencies, civil agencies, defense contractors and ministries of defense around the world. Beginning in 2018, the product lines referenced above previously included in the Interior Systems segment are now being reported in Communication and navigation within the Government Systems segment. See the supplemental schedule included in this press release for revised fiscal year 2017 quarterly sales that conform to the current presentation. Results from the second quarter of 2018 are summarized below.\n(dollars in millions) Q2 FY 18 Q2 FY 17 Inc/(Dec) Government Systems sales Avionics $ 359 $ 367 (2 )% Communication and navigation 295 198 49 % Total Government Systems sales $ 654 $ 565 16 % Operating earnings $ 131 $ 114 15 % Operating margin rate 20.0 % 20.2 % (20) bps Avionics sales decreased $8 million due primarily to lower simulation and training sales. Communication and navigation sales increased $75 million due to the B/E Aerospace acquisition mentioned above. In addition, communication and navigation sales increased 11% organically due to higher test and training range sales and higher deliveries of GPS-related products. Operating earnings increased $17 million and operating margin declined 20 basis points over the prior year as increased earnings from higher sales volume was unfavorably impacted by lower margins on B/E Aerospace thermal and electronic systems sales.\nInformation Management Services\nInformation Management Services (IMS) provides communication services, systems integration and security solutions across the aviation, airport, rail and nuclear security markets. Results from the second quarter of 2018 are summarized below.\n(dollars in millions) Q2 FY 18 Q2 FY 17 Inc/(Dec) Information Management Services sales $ 181 $ 183 (1 )% Operating earnings $ 41 $ 36 14 % Operating margin rate 22.7 % 19.7 % 300 bps IMS sales decreased primarily due to an 11% decline in non-aviation sales as a result of the completion of nuclear security mandate revenues. Aviation-related sales increased 3% primarily due to increased usage of connectivity services, partially offset by the absence of a bulk sale of connectivity related equipment that occurred in the prior year. IMS operating earnings and operating margin increased due to the favorable resolution of certain claims associated with a divested business, partially offset by the absence of the favorable resolution of certain international business jet support services claims in the prior year.\nCorporate and Financial Highlights\nIncome Taxes\nThe company's effective income tax rate on GAAP earnings was 22.5% for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to a rate of 27.9% for the same period last year. The lower current year effective income tax rate was primarily due to a lower U.S. Federal statutory tax rate from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"the Act\") and benefits from the jurisdictional mix of income as a result of the B/E Aerospace acquisition, partially offset by an increase to income tax expense from the refinement of the provisional estimate established in the first quarter associated with the Act.\nThe company's effective income tax rate on adjusted earnings was 19.1% in the second quarter of 2018, compared to 28.1% in the same period in the prior year. See the supplemental schedule included in this press release for a reconciliation between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings.\nCash Flow\nCash used for operating activities was $77 million for the first six months of fiscal year 2018, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $1 million in the first six months of fiscal year 2017. The increase in cash used for operating activities was due primarily to higher payments for production inventory and other operating costs, as well as higher employee incentive payments, partially offset by higher cash receipts from customers and lower income tax payments.\nThe Company paid a dividend on its common stock of 33 cents per share, or $54 million, in the second quarter of 2018.\nConference Call\nIn light of the pending acquisition of Rockwell Collins by United Technologies Corporation (\"UTC\"), the Company will not hold a conference call for its quarterly results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. The Company plans to file its Form 10-Q for the second quarter with the SEC on or about April 27, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nSee the supplemental schedule included in this press release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures including adjusted earnings per share, adjusted income, and effective income tax rate on adjusted earnings.\nBusiness Highlights\nRockwell Collins recognized as Crystal Cabin Award winner\nThe Crystal Cabin Award recognizes excellence in aircraft interior innovation.
