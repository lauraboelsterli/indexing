(NASDAQ:FRBK), the holding company for Republic Bank, today announced its financial results for the period ended March 31, 2018.\nThree Months Ended ($ in millions, except per share data) 03/31/18 03/31/17 % Change Assets $ 2,471.5 $ 1,968.6 26 % Loans 1,250.9 1,026.1 22 % Deposits 2,123.5 1,720.5 23 % Total Revenue $ 25.4 $ 20.5 24 % Income Before Tax 2.1 1.8 23 % Net Income * 1.8 1.8 (1 %) Net Income per Share $ 0.03 $ 0.03 - %\n* Note: Net income for the period ended 3/31/18 reflects a normalized provision for federal and state income taxes which\nwas excluded from 2017 results due to an adjustment to the DTA valuation allowance recorded by the Company.\nVernon W. Hill, II, Chairman of Republic First Bancorp said:\n“2018 is off to a tremendous start which can be seen in our first quarter financial results. Assets, loans and deposits have all grown in excess of 20% year over year. And our revenue growth (24%) outpaced non-interest expense growth (20%) despite the ongoing investment required to execute our growth and expansion strategy. Our relentless commitment to extraordinary customer service and convenience through all delivery channels continues to deliver positive results throughout our footprint.”\nHarry D. Madonna, President and Chief Executive Officer of Republic First Bancorp said:\n“Momentum continues to build as the ‘Power of Red is Back’ expansion campaign rolls into 2018. We are thrilled to begin our expansion into Bucks County with the opening of our newest store in Fairless Hills, PA during the first quarter. We are very excited to introduce our unmatched commitment to customer service and convenience to the Fairless Hills community and look forward to the opportunity to win over new FANS throughout this new market. We’ve also broken ground on future store locations in Gloucester Township and Lumberton, NJ which are expected to open by mid-year.”\nHighlights for the Period Ended March 31, 2018\nTotal deposits increased by $403 million, or 23%, to $2.1 billion as of March 31, 2018 compared to $1.7 billion as of March 31, 2017. On a linked quarter basis deposits grew $60 million, or 3%, when compared to December 31, 2017.\nNon-interest bearing demand deposits grew by $100 million, or 27%, to $464 million over the last 12 months.\nNew stores opened since the beginning of the “Power of Red is Back” expansion campaign are currently growing deposits at an average rate of $27 million per year, while the average deposit growth for all stores over the last twelve months was approximately $19 million per store.\nIncome before tax increased by 23% to $2.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $1.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Total revenue grew by 24% while non-interest expense increased by 20%. The Company continues to open new stores and increase profitability despite the additional costs associated with the expansion strategy.\nNet income after tax was $1.8 million, or $0.03 per share, for the three month periods ending March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017. The Company began recognizing a normalized provision for federal and state income taxes during the first quarter of 2018 after reversing its deferred tax asset valuation allowance during the fourth quarter of 2017. Prior year results were not impacted by an income tax provision.\nThe Company converted $10.6 million of outstanding trust preferred securities to 1.6 million shares of common stock during the first quarter of 2018. This conversion will result in a reduction of interest expense of approximately $0.9 million on an annual basis going forward.\nThere are twenty-three convenient store locations open today. The Company began its expansion into Bucks County, PA by opening its newest store in Fairless Hills during the first quarter. Ground has been broken on sites in Gloucester Township and Lumberton, NJ and are expected to be completed by mid-year. There are also several additional sites in various stages of development for future store locations.\nTotal assets increased by $503 million, or 26%, to $2.5 billion as of March 31, 2018 compared to $2.0 billion as of March 31, 2017.\nTotal loans grew $225 million, or 22%, to $1.3 billion as of March 31, 2018 compared to $1.0 billion at March 31, 2017.\nAsset quality continues to improve. The ratio of non-performing assets to total assets declined to 0.85% as of March 31, 2018 compared to 1.45% as of March 31, 2017.\nThe net interest margin increased to 3.23% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 3.19% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The Company’s residential mortgage division, Oak Mortgage, is serving the home financing needs of customers throughout its footprint. Oak originated over $79 million in loans during the three month period ended March 31, 2018.\nMeeting the needs of small business customers continued to be an important part of the Company’s lending strategy. More than $21 million in new SBA loans were originated during the three month period ended March 31, 2018.\nThe Company’s Total Risk-Based Capital ratio was 16.00% and Tier I Leverage Ratio was 10.09% at March 31, 2018.\nBook value per common share increased to $3.99 as of March 31, 2018 compared to $3.84 as of March 31, 2017.\nIncome Statement\nThe major components of the income statement are as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share data):\nThree Months Ended 03/31/18 03/31/17 % Change Total Revenue $ 25,434 $ 20,525 24 % Provision for Loan Losses 400 - 100 % Non-interest Expense 20,102 16,804 20 % Income Before Taxes 2,149 1,753 23 % Provision (Benefit) for Taxes 372 (34 ) n/m Net Income 1,777 1,787 (1 %) Net Income per Share $ 0.03 $ 0.03 - % The Company reported net income of $1.8 million, or $0.03 per share, for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017.\nTotal revenue increased by $4.9 million, or 24%, to $25.4 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, compared to $20.5 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2017. This increase is primarily attributable to higher interest income as a result of the strong growth in interest-earning assets over the last twelve months driven by the Company’s “Power of Red is Back” expansion program.\nNon-interest income increased to $4.5 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 compared to $4.3 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2017.\nNon-interest expenses increased by $3.3 million, or 20%, to $20.1 million during the three month period ended March 31, 2018 compared to $16.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase was mainly caused by the increase in salaries and employee benefits as a result of annual merit increases along with increased staffing levels related to our growth strategy of adding and relocating stores. Occupancy and equipment expenses associated with the growth and relocation strategy also contributed to the increase in non-interest expenses.\nThe Company recorded a provision for income taxes in the amount of $372 thousand for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 compared to a benefit for income taxes in the amount of $34 thousand for the three month period ended March 31, 2017. The amount recorded during the first quarter of 2018 is a normalized provision reflective of the new corporate tax rate included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The benefit for income taxes recognized during the first quarter of 2017 was driven by an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance that had been recorded by Company in previous years. This valuation allowance was reversed during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nBalance Sheet\nThe major components of the balance sheet are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nDescription\n03/31/18\n03/31/17 % Change\n12/31/17 % Change Total assets $ 2,471,464 $ 1,968,588 26 % $ 2,322,347 6 % Total loans (net) 1,244,262 1,016,962 22 % 1,153,679 8 % Total deposits 2,123,451 1,720,512 23 % 2,063,295 3 % Total assets increased by $502.9 million, or 26%, as of March 31, 2018 when compared to March 31, 2017.
