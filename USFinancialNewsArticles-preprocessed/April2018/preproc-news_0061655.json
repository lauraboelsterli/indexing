    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Insperity, Inc. (NYSE: NSP), a leading provider of human resources and business performance solutions for America’s best businesses, today reported results for the first quarter ended Mar. 31, 2018:\nRevenues up 15% on worksite employee growth of 12% Gross profit up 25% on strong pricing and direct cost trends Net income up 40% to $50.0 million Adjusted EBITDA up 34% to $83.8 million EPS up 39% to $1.18; adjusted EPS up 53% to $1.41\nFirst Quarter Results\nFirst quarter 2018 net income and diluted earnings per share of $50.0 million and $1.18 represented increases of 40% and 39%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.41, a 53% increase over the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA increased 34% over the first quarter of 2017 to $83.8 million.\n“We are pleased to report these outstanding record results reflecting our dynamic business model and strong execution all across the company,” said Paul J. Sarvadi, Insperity chairman and chief executive officer. “Our key drivers to growth and profitability are in place setting up a fourth consecutive year of impressive earnings growth for 2018.”\nRevenues increased 15% over the first quarter of 2017 to $1.0 billion on a 12% increase in the average number of worksite employees paid per month. The continued double-digit worksite employee growth was the result of strong new client sales driven by an increase in the number of trained Business Performance Advisors, a continuing high level of client retention, and an improvement in the net hiring of worksite employees by our client base. Worksite employees paid from new sales increased 23% over the first quarter of 2017 on a 15% increase in the average number of trained Business Performance Advisors. Client attrition totaled only 8% during the heavy first quarter client renewal period, an improvement over the first quarter of 2017.\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 increased 25% over the first quarter of 2017 to $199.7 million. This increase was driven by the 12% worksite employee growth, lower cost trends in our benefits and workers’ compensation programs and solid pricing. Operating expenses increased 28% over the first quarter of 2017 to $135.0 million, including one-time bonuses related to tax reform and additional accruals for incentive compensation tied to our outperformance during the quarter.\nNet income and adjusted EBITDA per worksite employee per month increased 25% and 19%, respectively, over the first quarter of 2017 to $85 and $143, respectively.\nThe first quarter 2018 effective income tax rate of 23% was impacted by the enactment of tax reform in late 2017 and the benefit associated with the vesting of long-term incentive plan shares during the quarter.\n“Our double-digit worksite employee growth, combined with the effective management of pricing and direct cost programs, continued to produce adjusted EBITDA at record levels,” said Douglas S. Sharp, senior vice president of finance, chief financial officer and treasurer. “This strong cash flow positions us to continue to invest in the growth of our business while also providing excellent shareholder returns.”\n2018 Guidance\nThe company also announced its updated guidance for 2018, including the second quarter of 2018. Please refer to the accompanying financial tables at the end of this press release for the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures.\nQ2 2018 Full Year 2018 Average WSEEs 202,000 — 203,700 206,400 — 208,400 Year-over-year increase 12% — 13% 13% — 14% Adjusted EPS $0.59 — $0.63 $3.36 — $3.44 Year-over-year increase 44% — 54% 37% — 40% Adjusted EBITDA (in millions) $41 — $43 $218 — $223 Year-over-year increase 23% — 29% 23% — 25% Definition of Key Metrics\nAverage WSEEs - Determined by calculating the company’s cumulative worksite employees paid during the period divided by the number of months in the period.\nAdjusted EPS - Represents diluted net income per share computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation and costs associated with a one-time tax reform bonus paid to corporate employees.\nAdjusted EBITDA - Represents net income computed in accordance with GAAP, plus interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash stock-based compensation and costs associated with a one-time tax reform bonus paid to corporate employees.\nInsperity will be hosting a conference call today at 10 a.m. ET to discuss these results, provide guidance for the second quarter and an update to the full year guidance, and answer questions from investment analysts.

Bonus payroll cost varies from period to period, but has no direct impact to the company’s ultimate workers’ compensation costs under the current program. As a result, Insperity management refers to non-bonus payroll cost in analyzing, reporting and forecasting the company’s workers’ compensation costs.\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (GAAP) $ 356,569 $ 356,220 Less: Amounts payable for withheld federal and state income taxes, employment taxes and\nother payroll deductions\n254,202 271,547 Client prepayments 14,863 23,603 Adjusted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 87,504 $ 61,070 Adjusted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities excludes funds associated with federal and state income tax withholdings, employment taxes and other payroll deductions, as well as client prepayments.

Insperity management believes adjusted operating expenses is a useful measure of the company’s operating costs, as it allows for additional analysis of the company’s operating expenses separate from the impact of these items.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018 2017 Change Net income (GAAP) $ 49,991 $ 35,628 40.3 % Income tax expense 15,098 17,706 (14.7 )% Interest expense 1,070 623 71.7 % Depreciation and amortization 5,213 4,254 22.5 % EBITDA 71,372 58,211 22.6 % Stock-based compensation 3,135 4,503 (30.4 )% One-time tax reform bonus 9,306 — — Adjusted EBITDA $ 83,813 $ 62,714 33.6 % Net income per worksite employee per month (GAAP) $ 85 $ 68 25.0 % Income tax expense per worksite employee per month 26 34 (23.5 )% Interest expense per worksite employee per month 2 1 100.0 % Depreciation and amortization per worksite employee per month 9 8 12.5 % EBITDA per worksite employee per month 122 111 9.9 % Stock-based compensation per worksite employee per month 5 9 (44.4 )% One-time tax reform bonus per worksite employee per month 16 — — Adjusted EBITDA per worksite employee per month $ 143 $ 120 19.2 % EBITDA represents net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus costs associated with a one-time tax reform bonus paid to corporate employees and non-cash stock-based compensation. Insperity management believes EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are often useful measures of the company’s operating performance, as they allow for additional analysis of the company’s operating results separate from the impact of these items and Adjusted EBITDA is used by our lenders to assess our leverage and ability to make interest payments.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018 2017 Change Net income (GAAP) $ 49,991 $ 35,628 40.3 % Non-GAAP adjustments: Stock-based compensation 3,135 4,503 (30.4 )% One-time tax reform bonus 9,306 — — Total non-GAAP adjustments 12,441 4,503 176.3 % Tax effect (2,886 ) (1,495 ) 93.0 % Adjusted net income $ 59,546 $ 38,636 54.1 % Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018 2017 Change Diluted net income per share of common stock (GAAP) $ 1.18 $ 0.85 38.8 % Non-GAAP adjustments: Stock-based compensation 0.07 0.11 (36.4 )% One-time tax reform bonus 0.22 — — Total non-GAAP adjustments 0.29 0.11 163.6 % Tax effect (0.06 ) (0.04 ) 50.0 % Adjusted diluted net income per share of common stock $ 1.41 $ 0.92 53.3 % Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per share of common stock represent net income and diluted net income per share computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation and costs associated with a one-time tax reform bonus paid to corporate employees. Insperity management believes adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per share of common stock are useful measures of the company’s operating performance in this period, as they allow for additional analysis of the company’s operating results separate from the impact of these items.\nNon-bonus payroll cost, adjusted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, adjusted operating expenses, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per share of common stock are not financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similar measures used by other companies. Non-bonus payroll cost, adjusted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, adjusted operating expenses, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per share of common stock should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as provided in the tables above.\nThe following is a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures for second quarter and full year 2018 guidance (in millions, except per share amounts):\nQ2 2018\nGuidance\nFull Year 2018\nGuidance\nNet income (GAAP) $21 - $22 $120 - $124 Income tax expense 8 - 9 43 - 44 Interest expense 1 4 Depreciation and amortization 5 22 EBITDA 35 - 37 189 - 194 One-time tax reform bonus — 9 Stock-based compensation 6 20 Adjusted EBITDA $41 - 43 $218 - $223 Diluted net income per share of common stock (GAAP) $0.50 - $0.54 $2.85 - $2.93 Non-GAAP adjustments: One-time tax reform bonus — 0.22 Stock-based compensation 0.13 0.47 Total non-GAAP adjustments 0.13 0.69 Tax effect (0.04 ) (0.18 ) Adjusted EPS $0.59 - $0.63 $3.36 - $3.44\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180430005228/en/\nInsperity, Inc.\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nDouglas S.
