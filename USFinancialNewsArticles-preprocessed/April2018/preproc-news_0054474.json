    "text": "PHOENIX, Metro Phoenix Bank (OTCPink: MPHX)(\"Bank\") announced net income for quarter ending March 31, 2018 increased 98% to $828,000, or $0.22 per diluted share, from $417,000, or $0.11 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2017. Although reported net income decreased 33% from $1,237,000 in first quarter of 2017, when excluding non-recurring \"settlement\" income in the first quarter of 2017, the adjusted year-over-year first quarter net income increased 79% from $461,000.\nExcluding the Bank's one-time Deferred Tax Asset write down in the fourth quarter of 2017, the core earnings of the Bank reflect a stable trend over the past three quarters.\n\"The quality of the Bank's earnings continue to improve each quarter as our loan portfolio grows and we achieve better efficiency,\" stated Stephen P. Haggard, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We have a very good community bank 'brand' that has been reinforced over the past decade and we are fortunate to operate in a solid growth market that provides substantial opportunities. This combination of a strong brand and a strong market will continue to support solid loan portfolio growth and furthermore, generate reasonable fee income and SBA gains-on-sale opportunities throughout 2018.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nNet Income for the quarter was $828,000, or $0.22 per diluted share.
