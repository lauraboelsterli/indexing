    "text": "OXNARD, Calif., April 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CDTi Advanced Materials, Inc., (Nasdaq:CDTI) (“CDTi” or “the Company”), a leader in advanced emission control technology, reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and year\nMatthew Beale, CDTi Advanced Materials’ CEO, stated, “Our ability to deliver technology in powder form has redefined CDTi as a technology partner to catalyst manufacturers and automotive OEMs globally, creating new, highly scalable market opportunities in high growth markets such as India and China. Having completed our business realignment in 2017, we have significantly reduced our cash burn while creating a path to profitability as our powder business gains traction. In the first quarter of 2018 we announced our name change to CDTi Advanced Materials, which reflects our larger role as provider of enabling technology to the emissions catalyst market and our excellence in the material science of catalyst formulation.\n“Our primary focus in 2018 will be to pursue commercialization opportunities for our Powder-to-Coat (P2C™) technology in current vehicle programs, be they 2-wheel, passenger cars or commercial, that are the most immediate revenue opportunities for our advanced emission control technology. As we lay the foundation for cost-effective, global product delivery, a key part of our strategy is securing local production capability in India or China. In parallel, and in partnership with leading automotive industry and institutional partners, we are engaged in fundamental catalyst design projects with world-wide applications that have the potential to alter catalyst architecture to significantly reduce cost,” concluded Beale.\nFinancial Highlights: Fourth Quarter 2017 compared to Fourth Quarter 2016\nTotal revenue was $4.9 million, compared to $8.6 million. Coated catalyst revenue was $2.9 million, compared to $4.9 million. Emissions control systems revenue was $1.6 million, compared to $3.4 million. Technology and advanced materials revenue was $0.4 million, compared to $0.3 million. Gross margin was 21%, compared to 11%. 2016 included $1.1 million of inventory write-offs related to the implementation of CDTI’s strategy to outsource the company’s manufacturing. Total operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $2.4 million, compared to $9.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, which included a $4.7 million write-off of goodwill and $0.7 million of costs related to the closure of the company’s manufacturing facility in Canada. Net loss was $1.4 million, or $0.09 per share, compared to a net loss of $7.6 million, or $0.69 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Cash at December 31, 2017, was $2.8 million, compared to $3.3 million at September 30, 2017, and $7.8 million at December 31, 2016.\nFinancial Highlights: 2017 compared to 2016\nTotal revenue for the full year 2017 was $28.4 million, compared to $36.8 million for 2016. Gross margin was 21%, compared to 22% for 2016. Total operating expenses for 2017 were $11.8 million compared to $23.7 million, in 2016, which included $2.6 million in severance and other charges relating to CDTi’s corporate restructuring as well as a goodwill impairment of $4.7 million. Net loss for 2017 was $5.3 million, or $0.34 per share, compared to net loss of $23.5 million, or $3.84 per share, in 2016.\n2018 Financial Outlook\nBased on CDTi’s current business configuration, the company expects 2018 full-year revenue from its baseline, specialty emissions business for retrofit, oil and gas, mining and materials handling applications to be approximately $10 million. Based on the roll-out of current customer programs in China and India, sales of CDTi’s materials is expected to increase during the later part of 2018 and management will provide additional information regarding its contribution to 2018 and beyond in the coming months.\nGross margin is expected to range between 20% to 30% as the company continues to exit its manufacturing operations in its pursuit of its long-term 40% gross margin target. As CDTi realizes the full benefit of headcount reductions resulting from the sale of Durafit TM and the exit of the company’s high-volume coating activities in the third and fourth quarter of 2017, along with the significant cost-cutting measures completed as part of CDTi’s business realignment, the company expects its operating expenses will be approximately $8 million for 2018.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nCDTi will host a conference call and live webcast beginning at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time today, April 2 nd to discuss its financial results and its business outlook.
