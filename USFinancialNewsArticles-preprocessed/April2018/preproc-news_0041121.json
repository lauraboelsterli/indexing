About 12,000 schools and other educational institutions have signed up to grow school gardens. Gardening has also been added to school curriculums with an aim to promote gardening as an activity.\nThe RHS campaign in Europe provides support and encourages institutions to promote school gardening. Institutes, such as Cambridge Primary, and Milford Pre-School, among others, have registered for school gardening campaigns and companies, such as Fisker Inc., Husqvarna Group and others, are developing gardening tools especially designed for children.\nMoreover, the trend of urban green spaces is also supporting the growth of the market. Urban green spaces are those spaces in the city which are covered by vegetation or other soft and permeable surfaces. The interest in urban and green spaces seems to be rising and many cities are giving trials to innovative ways to introduce urban greenery into the cities. Cities are generating greener spaces to create more calm and environment-friendly places.\nDownload and View Report TOC, Figures and Tables @ https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/market-research/gardening-and-agriculture-equipment-market/toc\nSport turfs and Synthetic Grass to Act as Roadblock\nThe utilization of artificial turfs has moved rapidly beyond sports fields to commercial and residential landscaping. Use of synthetic grass and sports turfs is increasing as these require lower maintenance. Apart from that, they are also environment-friendly as they require less water.\nSynthetic grass and sports turfs are employed in indoor as well as outdoor residential and public gardens, play areas as well as airports as they add to the aesthetic appeal and give a natural look to the space where they are used and also have low maintenance cost. Hereafter, they are being preferred by end users over natural grass. Nevertheless, this, in turn, would lead to a decline in the growth of the gardening tools market.\nGet full Report Now https://www.persistencemarketresearch.com/checkout/22726\nPersistence Market Research Overview\nPersistence Market Research (PMR) is a third-platform research firm.
