S&P 500 e-minis were down 11 points, or 0.42 percent, with 169,535 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 33.5 points, or 0.51 percent, on volume of 58,191 contracts.\nThe CBOE Volatility index, a gauge of short-term stock market volatility jumped to more than 1-week high to 18.61 points.\nComcast fell 2.6 percent after the U.S. cable company submitted a $31 billion offer for pay-TV group Sky , challenging an already agreed but lower takeover bid from Rupert Murdoch’s Fox.\nTwitter jumped 3.64 percent after reporting its second profitable quarter and topping Wall Street estimates for revenue and monthly active users.\nFacebook which is set to report after market closes on Wednesday, was down 0.12 percent.
