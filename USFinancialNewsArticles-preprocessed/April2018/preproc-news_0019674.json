    "text": "SAN MATEO, Calif., April 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cloudian , the innovation leader in enterprise object storage systems, today announced the appointment of Michael Morgan as chief financial officer (CFO). Morgan, who has a successful track record of transforming private companies to well-managed publicly traded firms, will oversee finance, legal, human resources and operations at Cloudian.\nMorgan represents the latest addition to Cloudian’s fast-growing team as the company enters a fourth year of record growth. In the last 12 months, Cloudian grew bookings from repeat customers five-fold, doubled its customer base to more than 200 customers, and increased funding through a $125 million joint venture with private equity firm Digital Alpha.\nMost recently, Morgan served as CFO of Tegile Systems, where he led the company’s financial operations through rapid revenue growth, multiple financing rounds, and the successful sale of the company to Western Digital. Prior to Tegile, Morgan served as the CFO at cloud storage company Panzura where he implemented all financial systems and infrastructure during a period of three-fold annual revenue growth.\nMorgan has also served as CFO at Model N, where he helped manage the company to profitability, and at Skybox Security where he raised several rounds of funding and scaled the company’s financial systems. Morgan has also served as CFO of BackWeb Technologies, and led two IPOs including Talarian, which was acquired by Tibco Software.\nMorgan spent the first six years of his career gaining financial and operations consulting experience with KPMG, LLC. He is a CPA and holds a BS from San Jose State University.\n“Mike adds deep financial and operational expertise in both public and private growth companies,” said Michael Tso, Cloudian CEO. “As we continue to scale the company, Mike’s leadership experience puts us in a strong position to capitalize on the tremendous market demand for our limitlessly scalable enterprise file and object storage systems.”\n“Cloudian is positioned for success in a way that I have seen very rarely in my career,” said Morgan. “The company’s technology depth, rapidly growing market adoption, experienced executive team, and strong financial backing from leading investors make for a compelling opportunity. I’m looking forward to accelerating Cloudian’s already impressive momentum.”\nAbout Cloudian\nCloudian turns information into insight with an infinitely scalable platform that consolidates, manages and protects enterprise data.
