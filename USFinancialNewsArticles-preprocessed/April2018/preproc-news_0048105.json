    "text": "NEW YORK, U.S. stocks slid on Tuesday as 10-year Treasury yields hit 3 percent for the first time in four years, stoking concerns over higher borrowing rates for companies already facing rising costs, and as quarterly results failed to deliver positive outlooks.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 423.32 points, or 1.73 percent, to 24,025.37, the S&P 500 lost 35.74 points, or 1.34 percent, to 2,634.55 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 121.25 points, or 1.7 percent, to 7,007.35.
