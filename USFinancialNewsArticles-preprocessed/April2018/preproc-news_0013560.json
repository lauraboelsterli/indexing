Then, on February 27, 2018, the Company revealed that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had issued a refusal-to-file letter rejecting the New Drug Application (\"NDA\") for Ozanimod, another of its leading drug candidates, because \"the nonclinical and clinical pharmacology sections in the NDA were insufficient to permit a complete review.\"\nOn this news, the price of Celgene's shares plummeted.\nAbout Kahn Swick & Foti, LLC\nKSF, whose partners include the former Louisiana Attorney General Charles C.
