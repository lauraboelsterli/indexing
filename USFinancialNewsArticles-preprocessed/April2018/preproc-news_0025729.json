    "text": "April 13, 2018 / 10:26 AM / Updated an hour ago Kremlin: it's understandable lawmakers hitting back on U.S. sanctions Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nMOSCOW, April 13 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Friday that it had not yet closely examined legislation drafted by Russian lawmakers in response to new U.S. sanctions, but that it was understandable that they wanted to retaliate. \nLawmakers said earlier on Friday they had drafted legislation in response to new U.S. sanctions that proposes banning or restricting imports of a raft of U.S. goods and services to Russia and curbing economic ties. \nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in a conference call with reporters that any response by Moscow to the sanctions imposed by Washington would not harm Russiaâ€™s interests.
