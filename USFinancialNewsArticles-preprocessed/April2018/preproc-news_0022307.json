    "text": "Published: Apr 11, 2018 8:46 a.m. ET Share \nDiscussions show risks amid Mideast rift, depth of interest in U.S. shale Reuters U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis stands with Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al-Thani during an Enhanced Honor Cordon at the Pentagon Monday. \nBy Sarah McFarlane Bradley Olson \nExxon Mobil Corp. is in talks with Qatar over a partnership that could see the Middle Eastern nation owning U.S. gas, people familiar with the matter said. \nThe potential deal could lead to the state energy giant Qatar Petroleum investing in Exxon’s XOM, +2.94% vast U.S. gas resources, extending from West Texas to North Dakota, according to the people, as both seek to deepen an already lucrative relationship each needs to face off current challenges. It could take the shape of a joint venture in which Qatar partners or invests in future wells with Exxon subsidiary XTO Energy, these people said. \nQatar wants to broaden its investments outside the Middle East and curry favor with Washington amid an economic blockade from Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies. Qatar’s leader is due to meet U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday. \nRead: Oil prices rise on heightened Middle East tensions \nExxon’s operations in Qatar are hugely profitable and it also needs Doha’s financial support and signoff to proceed on a massive $10 billion natural gas-export project in East Texas. The development is critical to allowing the company to find markets abroad for its U.S. gas bounty as prices come under pressure domestically.",
