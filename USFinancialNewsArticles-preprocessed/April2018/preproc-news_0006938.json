    "text": "EditorsNote: moves up several paragraphs\nKyle Connor’s 30th goal in an impressive rookie season was the overtime winner, and goalie Steve Mason was victorious in his first game in nearly a month as the Winnipeg Jets earned a 5-4 win over the host Montreal Canadiens on Tuesday night.\nWinnipeg recovered after blowing 3-0 and 4-3 leads.\nConnor, who finished with three points, was in the slot when he took the pass and buried a shot past Canadiens goalie Carey Price exactly three minutes into overtime to the disappointment of the Bell Centre crowd.\nPrice played his 557th game for the Canadiens, which surpassed the legendary Jacques Plante for the most by a goalie in franchise history. He stopped 27 shots in the loss.\nMason, who had played just one game in nearly three months, made 36 saves as the Jets reached the 50-win mark for the first time in franchise history.\nPaul Byron pulled Montreal within 3-2 at the 3:19 mark of the third period by pouncing on a rebound for his 20th goal on the season, and then Kerby Rychel deflected a point shot at 10:15 of the third period to make it a 3-3 game. It was Rychel’s first goal of the season.\nWinnipeg regained the lead just 24 seconds later when Sami Niku netted a goal in his NHL debut, on his first career shot on goal, but again the Habs drew even when Alex Galchenyuk potted a power-play goal with 1:42 remaining in regulation.\nPatrik Laine’s 44th goal of the season on the power play opened the scoring at the 12:25 mark of the first period. Laine fired a one-timer from just beyond the left circle for his 20th man-advantage marker of the campaign, tops in the NHL.\nNikolaj Ehlers doubled the Winnipeg lead with his 29th of the season at 14:19 by finishing a give-and-go passing play with Paul Stastny.\nJack Roslovic made it a 3-0 game with a goal very similar to Laine’s at 15:58 of the second period, but the Canadiens roared back.\nArtturi Lehkonen was on the spot for a loose puck in the slot and whipped a shot past Mason with 59.3 seconds remaining in the middle frame to put the hosts on the board.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
