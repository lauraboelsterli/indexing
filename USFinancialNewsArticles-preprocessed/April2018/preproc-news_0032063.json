Wichmann, chief executive officer of UnitedHealth Group.\nBased on first quarter results and the business outlook for the balance of the year, UnitedHealth Group has increased its outlook for 2018 net earnings to a range of $11.70 to $11.95 per share and adjusted net earnings of $12.40 to $12.65 per share.\nUnitedHealth Group\nQuarterly Financial Performance Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, March 31, December 31, 2018\n2017\n2017\nRevenues $55.2 billion $48.7 billion $52.1 billion Earnings From Operations $4.1 billion $3.4 billion $4.0 billion Net Margin 5.1% 4.5% 6.9% 1\nUnitedHealth Group’s first quarter 2018 revenues grew 13.3 percent or $6.5 billion year-over-year to $55.2 billion. First quarter earnings from operations grew $640 million or 18.8 percent year-over-year to $4.1 billion. Adjusted net earnings of $3.04 per share grew 28.3 percent. Adjusted cash flows from operations of $3.2 billion were 1.1x net income in first quarter 2018, compared to $2.0 billion and 0.9x net income in first quarter 2017. The revenue effect from the return of the health insurance tax in first quarter 2018 was the primary driver of the 100 basis point year-over-year decrease in the consolidated medical care ratio to 81.4 percent. Medical cost reserves developed favorably by $290 million in first quarter 2018. The operating cost ratio of 15.4 percent in the first quarter of 2018 increased 100 basis points year-over-year in response to the return of the health insurance tax. The first quarter 2018 income tax rate of 21.5 percent reflected the reduced federal statutory rate and seasonally higher stock-based compensation activity, partially offset by the return of the nondeductible health insurance tax. First quarter 2018 days claims payable of 49 days were essentially flat sequentially and year-over-year; first quarter days sales outstanding rose two days sequentially and one day year-over-year to 19 days, due to the addition of Empresas Banmédica and growth in government-based offerings. UnitedHealth Group repurchased 11.6 million shares for $2.65 billion in the first quarter and paid $722 million in dividends to shareholders, an increase of 21.1 percent over first quarter 2017. Annualized return on shareholders’ equity increased 210 basis points year-over-year to 23.8 percent in the first quarter. Debt to total capital of 41.6 percent at March 31, 2018 decreased 190 basis points year-over-year, while increasing 270 basis points sequentially due principally to the Empresas Banmédica merger.\n1 Fourth quarter 2017 included a $1.2 billion favorable non-cash revaluation of the Company’s U.S. net deferred tax liability, increasing net margin by 230 basis points in that quarter.\nUnitedHealthcare\nUnitedHealthcare provides global health care benefits, serving individuals and employers, and Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.\nQuarterly Financial Performance Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, March 31, December 31, 2018\n2017\n2017\nRevenues $45.5 billion $40.1 billion $41.6 billion Earnings From Operations $2.4 billion $2.1 billion $1.8 billion Operating Margin 5.3% 5.3% 4.2% UnitedHealthcare grew to serve 2.2 million more consumers 2 in the first quarter of 2018, helping grow revenues by $5.3 billion or 13.3 percent year-over-year to $45.5 billion. First quarter 2018 earnings from operations of $2.4 billion grew 12.5 percent. UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual first quarter 2018 revenues of $13.4 billion increased $675 million year-over-year, due to growth in people served over the past 12 months, increases in rates to cover expected medical cost trends and the resumption of the health insurance tax. As expected, UnitedHealthcare Employer & Individual served 195,000 fewer people in commercial group plans in the quarter, reflecting employers shifting their retirees from self-funded offerings to group Medicare Advantage plans, and lower retention due to pricing actions to cover the full cost of the health insurance tax. UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement grew revenues by $2.4 billion or 14.3 percent year-over-year to $18.9 billion in the first quarter of 2018. The business served 375,000 more seniors in the quarter, including 330,000 in Medicare Advantage through individual products and employer-sponsored group retiree plans. The number of people served through Medicare Advantage grew 10.6 percent year-over-year. In first quarter 2018, UnitedHealthcare Community & State revenues of $10.7 billion grew $1.7 billion or 19.2 percent year-over-year, reflecting strong 12-month membership growth and an increasing mix of individuals with higher clinical needs. First quarter membership was consistent with year end 2017, as strong growth serving people in continuing markets offset the Delaware market withdrawal. UnitedHealthcare Global served 6.1 million people at March 31, 2018, having broadened its platform to serve people in Chile, Colombia and Peru through a merger with Empresas Banmédica, a leading health plan and care delivery organization serving more than 2 million people with health care benefits. Global revenues of $2.45 billion grew 29.2 percent year-over-year.\n2 Reflects net consumer growth excluding the TRICARE military health program, which concluded in 2017.\nOptum\nOptum is a health services business serving the global health care marketplace, including payers, care providers, employers, governments, life sciences companies and consumers.

Optum’s operating margin of 7 percent increased 100 basis points year-over-year in total, with performance improvements at each business. First quarter earnings from operations grew $374 million or 29.2 percent year-over-year to $1.7 billion, with double-digit percentage increases for every business segment. OptumHealth revenues of $5.8 billion grew $1 billion or 21.7 percent year-over-year, driven by growth in care delivery and behavioral, digital consumer engagement and health financial services. OptumHealth served 91 million people at quarter end, having grown by 9 million people 3 or 11 percent over the past year. OptumInsight revenues grew 12.3 percent to $2.1 billion in first quarter 2018, driven by growth and expansion in payer technology and services and care provider advisory services. OptumInsight’s contract backlog of $15.2 billion grew year-over-year by $2.1 billion or 16 percent. OptumRx first quarter 2018 revenues grew 7.8 percent year-over-year to $16.1 billion. OptumRx fulfilled 332 million adjusted scripts in first quarter 2018, growing 3.1 percent over the prior year, with favorable mix in specialty pharmacy and home delivery services.\n3 Reflects net consumer growth excluding the TRICARE military health program, which concluded in 2017.\nAbout UnitedHealth Group\nUnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) is a diversified health and well-being company dedicated to helping people live healthier lives and helping make the health system work better for everyone.

These statements are intended to take advantage of the “safe harbor” provisions of the PSLRA. Generally the words “believe,” “expect,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “forecast,” “outlook,” “plan,” “project,” “should” and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, which generally are not historical in nature. These statements may contain information about financial prospects, economic conditions and trends and involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that actual results could differ materially from those that management expects, depending on the outcome of certain factors.\nSome factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from results discussed or implied in the forward-looking statements include: our ability to effectively estimate, price for and manage our medical costs, including the impact of any new coverage requirements; new laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, or their enforcement or application, including increases in medical, administrative, technology or other costs or decreases in enrollment resulting from U.S., Brazilian and other jurisdictions’ regulations affecting the health care industry; the outcome of the Department of Justice’s legal actions relating to risk adjustment submission matters; our ability to maintain and achieve improvement in CMS star ratings and other quality scores that impact revenue; reductions in revenue or delays to cash flows received under Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs, including the effects of a prolonged U.S. government shutdown or debt ceiling constraints; changes in Medicare, including changes in payment methodology, the CMS star ratings program or the application of risk adjustment data validation audits; cyber-attacks or other privacy or data security incidents; failure to comply with privacy and data security regulations; regulatory and other risks and uncertainties of the pharmacy benefits management industry; competitive pressures, which could affect our ability to maintain or increase our market share; changes in or challenges to our public sector contract awards; our ability to execute contracts on competitive terms with physicians, hospitals and other service providers; failure to achieve targeted operating cost productivity improvements, including savings resulting from technology enhancement and administrative modernization; increases in costs and other liabilities associated with increased litigation, government investigations, audits or reviews; failure to manage successfully our strategic alliances or complete or receive anticipated benefits of acquisitions and other strategic transactions; fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our reported shareholders’ equity and results of operations; downgrades in our credit ratings; the performance of our investment portfolio; impairment of the value of our goodwill and intangible assets if estimated future results do not adequately support goodwill and intangible assets recorded for our existing businesses or the businesses that we acquire; failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems or if our technology products do not operate as intended; and our ability to obtain sufficient funds from our regulated subsidiaries or the debt or capital markets to fund our obligations, to maintain our debt to total capital ratio at targeted levels, to maintain our quarterly dividend payment cycle or to continue repurchasing shares of our common stock.\nThis list of important factors is not intended to be exhaustive. We discuss certain of these matters more fully, as well as certain risk factors that may affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations, in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Any or all forward-looking statements we make may turn out to be wrong, and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict or quantify. Actual future results may vary materially from expectations expressed or implied in this document or any of our prior communications.

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted Net Earnings per Share - Adjusted Cash Flows from Operations Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted net earnings per share and adjusted cash flows from operations are non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted net earnings per share excludes from the relevant GAAP metric, as applicable, intangible amortization and other items, if any, that do not relate to the Company's underlying business performance. Management believes that the use of adjusted net earnings per share provides investors and management useful information about the earnings impact of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization. Management believes the exclusion of these items provides a more useful comparison of the Company's underlying business performance from period to period.\nManagement believes that the use of adjusted cash flows from operations provides investors and management with useful information to compare our cash flows from operations for the current period to that of other periods, when the Company does not receive its monthly payment from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the applicable quarter. CMS generally remits their monthly payments on the first calendar day of the applicable month. However, if the first calendar day of the month falls on a weekend or a holiday, CMS has typically paid the Company on the last business day of the preceding calendar month. As such, quarterly operating cash flows determined in accordance with GAAP may occasionally include CMS premium payments for two months or four months. Adjusted cash flows from operating activities presents operating cash flows assuming all CMS payments were received on the first calendar day of the applicable month.\nUNITEDHEALTH GROUP\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(in millions, except per share data)\n(unaudited) ADJUSTED NET EARNINGS PER SHARE Three Months Ended March 31, Projected\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2018 2017 2018 GAAP net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $ 2,836 $ 2,172 $11,525 to $11,775\nIntangible amortization 220 219 ~885 Tax effect of intangible amortization (55 ) (82 ) ~(220) Adjusted net earnings attributable to UnitedHealth Group common shareholders $ 3,001 $ 2,309 $12,200 to $12,450 GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 2.87 $ 2.23 $11.70 to $11.95 Intangible amortization per share 0.22 0.22 ~0.90 Tax effect per share of intangible amortization (0.05 ) (0.08 ) ~(0.20) Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 3.04 $ 2.37 ~$12.40 to $12.65 ADJUSTED CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 GAAP cash flows from operations $ 8,369 $ 6,456 Add: April CMS premium payments received in March (5,144 ) (4,442 ) Adjusted cash flows from operations $ 3,225 $ 2,014 Click here to subscribe to Mobile Alerts for UnitedHealth Group .\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180417005655/en/\nUnitedHealth Group\nInvestors:\nBrett Manderfeld, 952-936-7216\nVice President\nor\nJohn S.
