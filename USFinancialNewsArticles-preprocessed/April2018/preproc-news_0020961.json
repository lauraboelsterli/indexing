    "text": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee for hours on Tuesday, with questions ranging from the social network’s regulation to its cooperation with the Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\nRepeated questions from multiple senators -- and the collision between the chamber and one of the most famous faces in Silicon Valley -- made for some awkward moments. Here are some of the highlights from Zuckerberg’s Tuesday testimony.\nLindsey Graham Bringing Up Monopolies Boom! https://t.co/YJHSIrSICS \n— Daniel Rorke (@dkroue45) April 10, 2018 \n\nWhen Sen. Lindsey Graham asked Zuckerberg about Facebook’s “biggest competitor,” Zuckerberg responded that Facebook has “a lot of competitors.” When pressed to name the primary one, however, the founder struggled to respond succinctly -- leading Graham to ask if Facebook has a monopoly on the market.\n“It certainly doesn’t feel like that to me,” Zuckerberg answered, drawing a few chuckles from the crowd.\nOrrin Hatch Asking How Facebook Makes Money Sen. Hatch: \"If [a version of Facebook will always be free], how do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service?\"\nMark Zuckerberg: \"Senator, we run ads.\" https://t.co/CbFO899XlU pic.twitter.com/bGKWks7zIk \n— CBS News (@CBSNews) April 10, 2018 \n\nAt one point in his testimony, Zuckerberg said that “a version” of Facebook will always be free, causing some confusion about the site’s business model for one senator.\n“If so, how do you sustain a business model in which users don’t pay for your service?” asked Sen. Orrin Hatch.\n“Senator, we run ads,” Zuckerberg responded, after a lengthy pause.\nZuckerberg Backtracking About Special Counsel Cooperation Mark Zuckerberg confirms that special counsel Robert Mueller's team has interviewed Facebook's staff about Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election https://t.co/PVGk2UXucM pic.twitter.com/4TPN2zJRdY \n— CNN Breaking News (@cnnbrk) April 10, 2018 \n\nSen. Patrick Leahy asked Zuckerberg if Facebook had been subpoenaed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office, and if employees had been interviewed. Zuckerberg replied affirmatively to both, but noted that he had not been interviewed by Mueller's office.\nHe quickly backtracked, however, saying that, while Facebook is cooperating with the special counsel , he cannot be certain subpoenas have actually been issued.\nZuckerberg Sparring with Ted Cruz Zuckerberg getting grilled by Cruz. https://t.co/0xBT7xnMeO \n— Kathy Jay (@kathyjay001) April 10, 2018 \n\nSen. Ted Cruz grilled Zuckerberg on a number of issues related to censorship and political bias, but things got a bit heated when he brought up Palmer Luckey, an ex-employee who was involved in the pro-Donald Trump group Nimble America .\nWhen asked why Luckey was fired, Zuckerberg responded, “That is a specific personnel matter that it seems like it would be inappropriate to speak to here,” before adding, when pressed, that, “It was not because of a political view.”\nDick Durbin Musing About Privacy By Asking for Zuckerberg’s Hotel Information what hotel did you stay in last night @facebook @KEEMSTAR https://t.co/z8GfKBldyO \n— Kai? (@77degrees_) April 10, 2018 \n\nTo drive home a point about privacy, Sen. Dick Durbin asked Zuckerberg whether he would “be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?”\nZuckerberg laughed, paused, and eventually responded, “No.”\nDurbin then asked if Zuckerberg would share the identities of those he had messaged with recently -- which Zuckerberg again declined to do.\nZuckerberg Fumbling a 'Softball' Question from Dan Sullivan Watch this exchange between Sen. Sullivan and Zuckerberg: \"You're supposed to answer 'yes'\" #tictocnews pic.twitter.com/Huqqwjsi7F \n— TicToc by Bloomberg (@tictoc) April 10, 2018 \n\nSen. Dan Sullivan threw Zuckerberg \"a softball\" by alluding to the fact that his tech behemoth could only have been built in America. When Zuckerberg began to answer by praising Chinese internet companies, Sullivan said, laughing, \"You're supposed to say yes to this question. Okay, come on, I'm trying to help you. Give me a break.\"\nJohn Kennedy Has Thoughts on Facebook’s User Agreement . @SenJohnKennedy goes in on Zuck. https://t.co/LeYAjkcFtU \n— Justin Robert Young (@JustinRYoung) April 10, 2018 \n\nLouisiana Sen. John Kennedy challenged Facebook's current user agreement, saying it is established to \"cover Facebook's rear end\" and not as a way to inform people of their rights. He challenged Zuckerberg to rewrite it \"in English\" so that the \"average American can understand it.\"\n\"Your user agreement sucks,\" he said.",
