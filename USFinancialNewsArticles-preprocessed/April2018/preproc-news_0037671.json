Forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They often include the words \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"estimate,\" or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs such as \"will,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" or \"may.\" Forward-looking statements, by their nature, are subject to risks and uncertainties. A number of factors — many of which are beyond AltaPacific’s control — could cause actual conditions, events or results to differ significantly from those described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements include, among others, the following possibilities: (1) competitive pressures among depository and other financial institutions may increase significantly; (2) revenues may be lower than expected; (3) changes in the interest rate environment may reduce interest margins; (4) general economic conditions, either nationally or regionally, may be less favorable than expected, resulting in, among other things, a deterioration in credit quality and/or a reduced demand for credit; (5) legislative or regulatory changes, including changes in accounting standards and tax laws, may adversely affect the businesses in which AltaPacific is engaged; (6) competitors may have greater financial resources and develop products that enable such competitors to compete more successfully than AltaPacific; and (7) adverse changes may occur in the securities markets or with respect to inflation. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Except as required by law, AltaPacific does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent circumstances or events.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180418006613/en/\nAltaPacific Bancorp\nCharles O.
