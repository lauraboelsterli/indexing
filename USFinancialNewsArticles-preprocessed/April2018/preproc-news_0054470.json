These record volumes increased our Adjusted EBITDA by 35% compared to last year, allowing us to raise distributions by 30% while maintaining a strong balance sheet and coverage profile. Importantly, the first quarter results generated significant momentum towards achieving our long term Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow and distribution growth targets at AM and AMGP.\"\nFor a discussion of the non-GAAP financial measures Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow, and net debt please see \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nAntero Midstream First Quarter Financial Results\nLow pressure gathering volumes for the first quarter of 2018 averaged 1,835 MMcf/d, an 11% increase as compared to the prior year quarter and a Partnership record. Compression volumes for the first quarter of 2018 averaged 1,413 MMcf/d, a 37% increase as compared to the first quarter of 2017 and a Partnership record. High pressure gathering volumes for the first quarter of 2018 averaged 1,765 MMcf/d, a 12% increase over the first quarter of 2017. The increase in gathering and compression volumes was driven by production growth from Antero Resources in Antero Midstream's area of dedication. Fresh water delivery volumes averaged a record 221 MBbl/d during the quarter driven by increased completion activity by Antero Resources. During the quarter, Antero Midstream serviced 46 well completions with its fresh water delivery system, a 35% increase compared to the prior year quarter.\nGross processing volumes from our processing and fractionation joint venture with MarkWest (a wholly-owned subsidiary of MPLX) (the \"Joint Venture\") averaged 519 MMcf/d for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 905% compared to the prior year quarter. Gross Joint Venture fractionation volumes averaged 6,163 Bbl/d, a 754% increase compared to the prior year quarter. The increase in processing and fractionation volumes is driven by an increase in Antero Resources' rich gas and C3+ NGL volumes.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nAverage Daily Volumes:\n2017\n2018\n%\nChange\nLow Pressure Gathering (MMcf/d)\n1,659\n1,835\n11%\nCompression (MMcf/d)\n1,028\n1,413\n37%\nHigh Pressure Gathering (MMcf/d)\n1,581\n1,765\n12%\nFresh Water Delivery (MBbl/d)\n148\n221\n49%\nGross Joint Venture Processing (MMcf/d)\n52\n519\n905%\nGross Joint Venture Fractionation (Bbl/d)\n722\n6,163\n754%\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Partnership reported revenues of $229 million, comprised of $108 million from the Gathering and Processing segment and $121 million from the Water Handling and Treatment segment. Revenues increased 31% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by growth in throughput and fresh water delivery volumes. Water Handling and Treatment segment revenues include $46 million from wastewater handling and high rate water transfer services provided to Antero Resources, which are billed at cost plus 3%. The Partnership did not report revenues related to water treatment at the Antero Clearwater Facility as ongoing commissioning costs are credited to capital expenditures, net of treatment fees charged to Antero Resources.\nDirect operating expenses for the Gathering and Processing and Water Handling and Treatment segments were $11 million and $56 million, respectively, for a total of $67 million compared to $48 million in direct operating expenses in the prior year quarter. Water Handling and Treatment direct operating expenses include $44 million from wastewater handling and high rate water transfer services. General and administrative expenses including equity-based compensation were $14 million, in line with the prior year quarter. General and administrative expenses excluding equity-based compensation were $8 million during the first quarter of 2018, in line with the first quarter of 2017. Total operating expenses were $118 million, including $32 million of depreciation and $4 million of accretion of contingent acquisition consideration and asset retirement obligations.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $108 million, a 44% increase compared to the prior year quarter. The increase in net income was driven by growth in throughput and fresh water delivery volumes. Net income per limited partner unit was $0.43 per unit, a 23% increase compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $161 million, a 35% increase compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter included $7 million in combined distributions from Stonewall Gathering LLC and the processing and fractionation Joint Venture. Cash interest paid was $22 million. Cash reserved for bond interest during the quarter increased $9 million and cash reserved for payment of income tax withholding upon vesting of Antero Midstream equity-based compensation awards was $2 million. Maintenance capital expenditures during the quarter totaled $17 million. Distributable Cash Flow was $130 million, a 43% increase over the prior year quarter, resulting in a DCF coverage ratio of 1.3x.\nThe following table reconciles net income to Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow as used in this release (in thousands):\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n2017\n2018\nNet income\n$\n75,091\n$\n108,105\nInterest expense\n8,836\n11,297\nDepreciation expense\n27,536\n32,432\nAccretion of contingent acquisition consideration\n3,526\n3,874\nAccretion of asset retirement obligations\n—\n34\nEquity-based compensation\n6,286\n6,211\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates\n(2,231)\n(7,862)\nDistributions from unconsolidated affiliates\n—\n7,085\nAdjusted EBITDA\n119,044\n161,176\nInterest paid\n(19,668)\n(22,348)\nDecrease in cash reserved for bond interest (1)\n8,929\n8,734\nIncome tax withholding upon vesting of Antero Midstream Partners LP equity-based compensation awards (2)\n(1,500)\n(1,500)\nMaintenance capital expenditures (3)\n(15,903)\n(16,488)\nDistributable Cash Flow\n$\n90,902\n$\n129,574\nDistributions Declared to Antero Midstream Holders\nLimited Partners\n55,753\n72,923\nIncentive distribution rights\n11,553\n28,453\nTotal Aggregate Distributions\n$\n67,306\n$\n101,376\nDCF coverage ratio\n1.35x\n1.28x\n1)\nCash reserved for bond interest expense on Antero Midstream's 5.375% senior notes outstanding during the period that is paid on a semi-annual basis on March 15 th and September 15 th of each year.\n2)\nEstimate of current period portion of expected cash payment for income tax withholding attributable to vesting of Midstream LTIP equity-based compensation awards to be paid in the fourth quarter.\n3)\nMaintenance capital expenditures represent the portion of our estimated capital expenditures associated with (i) the connection of new wells to our gathering and processing systems that we believe will be necessary to offset the natural production declines Antero Resources will experience on all of its wells over time, and (ii) water delivery to new wells necessary to maintain the average throughput volume on our systems.\nGathering and Processing — Antero Midstream placed in service its largest compressor station to-date, adding an additional 240 MMcf/d of rich gas compression in the Marcellus. Additionally, the Partnership placed in service its second compressor station in the Utica Shale, adding an additional 200 MMcf/d of capacity during the first quarter of 2018. Antero Midstream's total compression capacity at the end of the first quarter of 2018 was 2.15 Bcf/d in the Marcellus and Utica combined, with utilization averaging 73% for the quarter. Additionally, Antero Midstream connected 27 wells to its gathering system during the quarter. Antero Resources is currently operating six drilling rigs on Antero Midstream dedicated acreage.\nThe Joint Venture brought online the Sherwood 9 processing plant, its third 200 MMcf/d cryogenic processing plant, during the quarter increasing the Joint Venture's total processing capacity to 600 MMcf/d. The Joint Venture plans to bring two more processing plants online by the end of 2018, bringing the Joint Venture's total processing capacity to 1.0 Bcf/d.\nWater Handling and Treatment — Antero Midstream's Marcellus and Utica fresh water delivery systems serviced 46 well completions during the first quarter of 2018, a 35% increase from the prior year quarter. Antero Resources is currently operating five completion crews on Antero Midstream dedicated acreage. Antero Midstream continued the commissioning process for the Antero Clearwater Facility during the first quarter of 2018 and expects to place the facility into full commercial service in the second quarter of 2018.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, Antero Midstream had $9 million in cash and $660 million drawn on its $1.5 billion bank credit facility, resulting in $850 million of liquidity. Antero Midstream's net debt to trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA was 2.3x as of March 31, 2018. For a reconciliation of consolidated net debt to consolidated total debt, the most comparable GAAP measure, please read \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nCommenting on Antero Midstream's balance sheet and liquidity, Michael Kennedy, CFO of Antero Midstream said, \"Antero Midstream continues to maintain a strong balance sheet with leverage of 2.3x and DCF coverage of 1.3x, in line with our stated targets. Our attractive partnership-wide rates of return and excess distributable cash flow have allowed us to maintain this attractive leverage profile and deliver on our organic project backlog.\"\nCapital Investments\nCapital expenditures, excluding investments in the processing and fractionation joint venture, were $128 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $104 million in the first quarter of 2017. Capital invested in gathering systems and related facilities was $94 million and capital invested in water handling and treatment assets was $34 million, including $19 million invested in the Antero Clearwater Facility. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates for the Joint Venture were $17 million during the quarter.\nAMGP First Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nAMGP's equity in earnings from Antero Midstream Partners, which reflects the cash distributions from Antero Midstream, was $28 million for the first quarter of 2018. Net income for the quarter was $13 million. AMGP's cash distributions from Antero Midstream were $27 million for first quarter of 2018, net of $0.8 million and $0.4 million of cash reserved and cash distributed to Series B units of IDR Holdings LLC, respectively. General and administrative expenses were $0.9 million, including $0.5 million of accrued special committee and legal advisory fees. The provision and reserve for income taxes was $7 million, resulting in cash available for distribution of $20 million. The increase in cash available for distribution is driven by an increase in cash distributions from Antero Midstream and the reduction in the U.S. federal tax rate.\nThe following table reconciles cash distributions from Antero Midstream and AMGP cash distribution per common share as presented in this release (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nCash distributions from Antero Midstream Partners LP\n$\n28,453\nCash reserved for distributions to Series B units of IDR LLC\n(826)\nCash distribution to Series B units of IDR LLC\n(413)\nCash distributions to Antero Midstream GP LP\n$\n27,214\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n(925)\nSpecial committee legal and advisory fees accrued in G&A expense (1)\n491\nProvision and reserve for income taxes\n(6,659)\nCash available for distribution\n$\n20,121\nDCF coverage ratio\n1.0x\nCommon shares outstanding\n186,188\nCash distribution per common share\n$\n0.108\n1)\nRepresents non-recurring accrued legal and advisory fees associated with the ongoing special committee process as disclosed on February 26, 2018.\nConference Call\nA joint conference call for Antero Midstream and AMGP is scheduled on Thursday, April 26, 2018 at 10:00 am MT to discuss the quarterly results.

Information on Antero Midstream's website and AMGP's website does not constitute a portion of this press release.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Definitions\nAntero Midstream views Adjusted EBITDA as an important indicator of the Partnership's performance. Antero Midstream defines Adjusted EBITDA as Net Income before interest expense, depreciation expense, accretion of contingent acquisition consideration, accretion of asset retirement obligations, equity-based compensation expense, excluding equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates and including cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates.\nAntero Midstream uses Adjusted EBITDA to assess:\nthe financial performance of the Partnership's assets, without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; its operating performance and return on capital as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy sector, without regard to financing or capital structure; and the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects.\nThe Partnership defines Distributable Cash Flow as Adjusted EBITDA less interest paid, income tax withholding payments and cash reserved for payments of income tax withholding upon vesting of equity-based compensation awards, cash reserved for bond interest and ongoing maintenance capital expenditures paid. Antero Midstream uses Distributable Cash Flow as a performance metric to compare the cash generating performance of the Partnership from period to period and to compare the cash generating performance for specific periods to the cash distributions (if any) that are expected to be paid to unitholders. Distributable Cash Flow does not reflect changes in working capital balances.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are non-GAAP financial measures. The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow is Net Income. The non-GAAP financial measures of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow should not be considered as alternatives to the GAAP measure of Net Income. Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are not presentations made in accordance with GAAP and have important limitations as an analytical tool because they include some, but not all, items that affect Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. Antero Midstream's definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other partnerships.\n\"Segment Adjusted EBITDA\" is also used by our management team for various purposes, including as a measure of operating performance and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as operating income before equity-based compensation expense, interest expense, depreciation expense, accretion, excluding equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, and including cash distributions from unconsolidated affiliates. Operating income represents net income before interest expense and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates, and is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to Segment Adjusted EBITDA because we do not account for interest expense on a segment basis.\nThe Partnership defines consolidated net debt as consolidated total debt less cash and cash equivalents. Antero Midstream views consolidated net debt as an important indicator in evaluating the Partnership's financial leverage.\nThe following table reconciles consolidated total debt to consolidated net debt as used in this release (in thousands):\nMarch 31,\n2018\nBank credit facility\n$\n660,000\n5.375% AM senior notes due 2024\n650,000\nNet unamortized debt issuance costs\n(8,720)\nConsolidated total debt\n$\n1,301,280\nCash and cash equivalents\n(8,714)\nConsolidated net debt\n$\n1,292,566\nThe following table reconciles net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018 as used in this release (in thousands):\nTwelve Months\nEnded\nMarch 31,\n2018\nNet income\n$\n340,328\nInterest expense\n40,018\nImpairment of property and equipment expense\n23,431\nDepreciation expense\n124,458\nAccretion of contingent acquisition consideration\n13,824\nAccretion of asset retirement obligations\n34\nEquity-based compensation\n27,208\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliate\n(25,825)\nDistributions from unconsolidated affiliates\n27,280\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n570,756\nAntero Midstream is a limited partnership that owns, operates and develops midstream gathering, compression, processing and fractionation assets as well as integrated water assets that primarily service Antero Resources Corporation's properties located in West Virginia and Ohio.
