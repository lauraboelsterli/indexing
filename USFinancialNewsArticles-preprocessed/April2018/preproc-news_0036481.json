    "text": "Anheuser-Busch has plans to turn its entire beverage line green , not in color but as part of a larger initiative for the iconic beverage maker to make more environmentally friendly choices.\nLast year, the company announced plans to have 100% of its purchased electricity come from renewable sources. It’s already using wind power at its brewery in Fairfield, Calif. and is looking into a mix of wind and solar going forward. It also preordered 40 of Tesla’s electric semi-trucks.\nNow the company is also planning to cut carbon dioxide emissions across the chain by 25% and to make all of its packaging out of returnable or recycled content. It will also engage in “water efficiency efforts,” across all of its facilities.\n“Our company has been around for 165 years , and these goals will ensure that we continue to make meaningful contributions toward building strong communities and a healthy environment for the next 165 years,” Michel Doukeris, CEO of Anheuser-Busch said in a statement.\nDoukeris says that the environmental efforts won’t impact the cost of the company’s beer, reports FOX News . One thing that will: President Trump’s new 10% tariff on aluminum.",
