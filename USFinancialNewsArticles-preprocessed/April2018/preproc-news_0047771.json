    "text": "COLOMBO, April 25 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan shares edged higher on Wednesday from their lowest close in more than one week as foreign buying provided some support to the market amid continued political uncertainty, stockbrokers said.\nForeign investors bought shares worth a net 315.9 million rupees ($2.0 million) on Wednesday, but they have been net sellers of 999.5 million rupees worth of equities so far this year.\nThe market has been awaiting signs of political stability after President Maithripala Sirisena suspended parliament until May 8. A cabinet reshuffle was expected on Monday, but government sources said it had been delayed.\nThe Colombo stock index ended 0.26 percent firmer at 6,533.63, edging up from its lowest close since April 16 hit on Tuesday. The index gained 0.88 percent last week.\n“High level of foreign interest in banking shares such as Sampath Bank helped the index,” said Dimantha Mathew, head of research, First Capital Holdings.\n“We have also seen some interest in blue chips after a while.”\nTurnover stood at 845.4 million rupees, less than this year’s daily average of 1.1 billion rupees.\nShares of conglomerate John Keells Holdings Plc rose 1.9 percent, while Ceylon Cold Stores Plc ended 3.2 percent firmer.\nDistilleries Company of Sri Lanka Plc closed 2.4 percent higher and Sampath Bank gained 1.3 percent.
