    "text": "First quarter 2018 revenues decreased to $716.3 million due to the liquidation of Toys“R”Us and retail inventory overhang, primarily in Europe; Reported net loss of $112.5 million or $0.90 per diluted share, includes after-tax expenses of $61.4 million associated with Toys“R”Us; $15.7 million of severance costs associated with an acceleration of the Company’s ongoing commercial organization transformation; and a net charge of $47.8 million related to U.S. tax reform (the “Non-GAAP Adjustments”); Adjusted net earnings of $12.4 million or $0.10 per diluted share; Ended the quarter with $1.6 billion in cash and returned $109.6 million to shareholders; $70.8 million in dividends and $38.8 million in share repurchases.\nPAWTUCKET, R.I.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ: HAS) today reported financial results for the first quarter 2018. Net revenues for the first quarter 2018 decreased 16% to $716.3 million versus $849.7 million in 2017. The decrease in revenues is the result of the liquidation of Toys“R”Us in the U.S. and U.K., along with uncertainty in its other operations, as well as retail inventory overhang, primarily in Europe.\nNet loss for the first quarter 2018 was $112.5 million, or $0.90 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $68.6 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, in 2017. Excluding the Non-GAAP Adjustments noted above, adjusted net earnings for the quarter were $12.4 million or $0.10 per diluted share. The first quarter 2018 was a 13-week period versus the first quarter 2017 which was a 14-week period.\n“The Hasbro teams executed extremely well during a challenging first quarter,” said Brian Goldner, Hasbro’s chairman and chief executive officer. “Hasbro brands are resonating with consumers and consumer takeaway is positive. However, as we discussed earlier in the year, our first quarter was expected to be difficult. We are working to put the near-term disruption from Toys“R”Us behind us. Our global retailers view this as an opportunity in a key consumer category and are partnering with Hasbro to develop growth plans for our brands. New Hasbro initiatives shipping in this quarter and beyond won’t be caught up in the Toys“R”Us liquidation process. With the rapid shift to a converged retail environment, we accelerated plans we originally had spread throughout the year to transform our commercial organization on a more immediate basis.”\n“Our underlying financial strength is sound, and despite the near-term challenges associated with a major customer liquidation, Hasbro is positioned to manage a challenging 2018 and drive growth in 2019 and beyond,” said Deborah Thomas, Hasbro’s chief financial officer. “The quarter’s revenue and profits were negatively impacted by lower revenues and higher expenses associated with events that do not reflect the health of our underlying business. We remain on track to meet our goal of generating $600 to $700 million in operating cash flow this year while investing to build our brands, transform our organization and return cash to shareholders.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Major Segment Performance\nNet Revenues\n($ Millions)\nOperating Profit (Loss)\n($ Millions)\nAdjusted Operating\nProfit (Loss) ($M)\nQ1 2018 Q1 2017 % Change Q1 2018 Q1 2017 Q1 2018 U.S. and Canada $364.3 $451.6 -19% $(23.4) $64.8 $28.9 International $287.9 $345.3 -17% $(56.1) $0.5 $(44.9) Entertainment and Licensing $64.0 $52.7 +21% $13.9 $11.3 $13.9 First quarter 2018 U.S. and Canada segment net revenues decreased 19% to $364.3 million compared to $451.6 million in 2017. The segment reported an operating loss of $23.4 million compared to an operating profit of $64.8 million in 2017. The segment’s first quarter performance reflected the Toys“R”Us liquidation both in lower revenues and $52.3 million of pre-tax expenses, primarily bad debt.\nFirst quarter 2018 International segment net revenues were $287.9 million compared to $345.3 million in 2017. Revenues in the segment were negatively impacted by efforts to clear excess inventory in Europe, as well as the Toys“R”Us U.K. liquidation and uncertainty in its other international operations. International segment revenues include a favorable $19.5 million impact of foreign exchange. On a regional basis, Europe net revenues decreased 28%, Latin America increased 2% and Asia Pacific increased 3%. Emerging markets net revenues decreased 5% in the quarter. The International segment reported an operating loss of $56.1 million compared to an operating profit of $0.5 million in 2017. The decline in operating profit reflects lower revenues and includes $11.2 million of pre-tax expense associated with Toys“R”Us.\nEntertainment and Licensing segment net revenues increased 21% to $64.0 million compared to $52.7 million in 2017. Operating profit increased 23% to $13.9 million, or 21.7% of net revenues, compared to $11.3 million, or 21.5% of net revenues, in 2017. Revenue growth was driven by consumer products and digital gaming. During the quarter, the Company adopted ASC 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers which favorably impacted the timing of revenue recognition in the quarter.\nAdditional pre-tax expense of $7.0 million associated with Toys“R”Us and $17.3 million from accelerating the commercial organization transformation are included in the Corporate and Eliminations segment.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Brand Portfolio Performance\nNet Revenues ($ Millions) Q1 2018 Q1 2017 % Change Franchise Brands $361.7 $449.2 -19% Partner Brands $200.6 $213.0 -6% Hasbro Gaming* $105.2 $135.8 -22% Emerging Brands $48.8 $51.8 -6% *Hasbro’s total gaming category, including all gaming revenue, most notably MAGIC: THE GATHERING and MONOPOLY, which are included in Franchise Brands in the table above, totaled $203.5 million for the first quarter 2018, down 20%, versus $253.3 million for the first quarter 2017. Hasbro believes its gaming portfolio is a competitive differentiator and views it in its entirety.\nFirst quarter 2018 revenues were negatively impacted across all Brand Portfolio categories by the liquidation of Toys“R”Us in the U.S. and U.K., along with uncertainty in its other operations, as well as retail inventory overhang, primarily in Europe.\nFirst quarter 2018 Franchise Brand revenues decreased 19% to $361.7 million. Growth in MONOPOLY was offset by declines in all other Franchise Brands in the quarter. Franchise Brand revenues grew in the Entertainment and Licensing segment and declined in the U.S. and Canada and International segments.\nPartner Brand revenues declined 6% to $200.6 million. Revenue growth in MARVEL and BEYBLADE was more than offset by declines in other Partner Brands. Partner Brand revenues increased slightly in the U.S. and Canada segment, but declined in the International segment.\nHasbro Gaming revenue decreased 22% to $105.2 million. Revenue gains in DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS, JENGA and several new game launches were offset by declines in other properties. Hasbro’s total gaming category was down 20% to $203.5 million. Hasbro Gaming revenues declined in all three major operating segments.\nEmerging Brands revenue declined 6% to $48.8 million. Revenue increases from STRETCH ARMSTRONG and LITTLEST PET SHOP products were offset by declines in other Emerging Brands. Emerging Brands revenues grew in the Entertainment and Licensing segment and declined in the U.S. and Canada and International segments.\nDividend and Share Repurchase\nThe Company paid $70.8 million in cash dividends to shareholders during the first quarter 2018. The next quarterly cash dividend payment of $0.63 per common share is scheduled for May 15, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 1, 2018.\nDuring the first quarter, Hasbro repurchased 427.1 thousand shares of common stock at a total cost of $38.8 million and an average price of $90.81 per share. At quarter-end, $139.2 million remained available in the current share repurchase authorization.\nNon-GAAP Adjustments\nDuring the first quarter, the Company recorded lower revenues in part due to the loss of revenues from Toys“R”Us in the U.S. and Europe, as a result of the related liquidations as well as uncertainty in the other Toys“R”Us operations. In association with this, the Company recorded after-tax expenses of $61.4 million, primarily bad debt.\nHasbro also recorded $15.7 million of after tax expense associated with accelerating its commercial organization transformation. Over the past several years, the Company has invested in developing an omni-channel retail presence, and in 2018 is bringing onboard new skill sets and talent to lead in today’s converged retail environment. These actions were initially planned to occur over time, commencing later this year. Given the current retail environment the Company chose to accelerate its actions.\nIn 2017, the Company recognized a provisional net charge of $296.5 million from the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Additional changes and guidance issued since year end resulted in a first quarter 2018 charge of $47.8 million, or $0.38 per diluted share. This charge is related to an increase in the Company’s repatriation tax liability and a reversal of tax benefits no longer permitted under the new guidance. The Company expects its full-year underlying tax rate to be at the high end of its previously projected range of 15% to 17%.\nConference Call Webcast\nHasbro will webcast its first quarter 2018 earnings conference call at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time today.

All Rights Reserved.\nCertain statements in this release contain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include expectations concerning the Company’s potential performance in the future and the Company’s ability to achieve its financial and business goals and may be identified by the use of forward-looking words or phrases. The Company's actual actions or results may differ materially from those expected or anticipated in the forward-looking statements due to both known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Specific factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: (i) the Company's ability to design, develop, produce, manufacture, source and ship products on a timely and cost-effective basis, as well as interest in and purchase of those products by retail customers and consumers in quantities and at prices that will be sufficient to recover the Company’s costs and earn a profit; (ii) downturns in economic conditions impacting one or more of the markets in which the Company sells products, such as the economic downturns which impacted the United Kingdom and Brazil in 2017, which can negatively impact the Company’s retail customers and consumers, and which can result in lower employment levels, lower consumer disposable income, lower retailer inventories and lower spending, including lower spending on purchases of the Company’s products; (iii) other factors which can lower discretionary consumer spending, such as higher costs for fuel and food, drops in the value of homes or other consumer assets, and high levels of consumer debt; (iv) consumer interest in entertainment properties, such as motion pictures, for which the Company is developing and marketing products, and the ability to drive sales of products associated with such entertainment properties, (v) potential difficulties or delays the Company may experience in implementing cost savings and efficiency enhancing initiatives; (vi) other economic and public health conditions or regulatory changes in the markets in which the Company and its customers and suppliers operate which could create delays or increase the Company’s costs, such as higher commodity prices, labor costs or transportation costs, or outbreaks of disease; (vii) currency fluctuations, including movements in foreign exchange rates, which can lower the Company’s net revenues and earnings, and significantly impact the Company’s costs; (viii) the concentration of the Company's customers, potentially increasing the negative impact to the Company of difficulties experienced by any of the Company’s customers or changes in their purchasing or selling patterns; (ix) consumer interest in and acceptance of the Discovery Family Channel, and programming created by Hasbro Studios, and other factors impacting the financial performance of the network and Hasbro Studios; (x) the inventory policies of the Company’s retail customers, including retailers’ potential decisions to lower their inventories, even if it results in lost sales, as well as the concentration of the Company's revenues in the second half and fourth quarter of the year, which coupled with reliance by retailers on quick response inventory management techniques increases the risk of underproduction of popular items, overproduction of less popular items and failure to achieve compressed shipping schedules; (xi) delays, increased costs or difficulties associated with any of our or our partners’ planned digital applications or media initiatives; (xii) work disruptions, which may impact the Company's ability to manufacture or deliver product in a timely and cost-effective manner; (xiii) the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the Company's significant retailers, such as the bankruptcy of Toys“R”Us in the United States and Canada in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the beginning of liquidation of those businesses, as well as economic difficulty of Toys“R”Us in other markets, which could negatively impact the Company's revenues or bad debt exposure; (xiv) the impact of competition on revenues, margins and other aspects of the Company's business, including the ability to offer Company products which consumers choose to buy instead of competitive products, the ability to secure, maintain and renew popular licenses and the ability to attract and retain talented employees; (xv) concentration of manufacturing for many of the Company’s products in the People’s Republic of China and the associated impact to the Company of social, economic or public health conditions and other factors affecting China, the movement of products into and out of China, the cost of producing products in China and exporting them to other countries, including without limitation, the potential application of tariffs to products the Company purchases from vendors in China, which would significantly increase the price of the Company’s products and harm sales; (xvi) the risk of product recalls or product liability suits and costs associated with product safety regulations; (xvii) the impact of other market conditions, third party actions or approvals and competition which could reduce demand for the Company’s products or delay or increase the cost of implementation of the Company's programs or alter the Company's actions and reduce actual results; (xviii) changes in tax laws or regulations, or the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations, such as what may occur as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is interpreted and applied, which may cause the Company to alter tax reserves or make other changes which significantly impact its reported financial results; (xix) the impact of litigation or arbitration decisions or settlement actions; and (xx) other risks and uncertainties as may be detailed from time to time in the Company's public announcements and Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings. The Company undertakes no obligation to make any revisions to the forward-looking statements contained in this release or to update them to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this release.\nThis press release includes non-GAAP financial measures as defined under SEC rules, specifically Adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share, excluding the impact of charges associated with the Toys“R”Us liquidation; severance costs and U.S. tax reform in the first quarter of 2018, as well as adjusted operating profit absent the impact of the charges associated with the Toys“R”Us liquidation and severance costs. Also included in the financial tables attached to this release are the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA represents net earnings attributable to Hasbro, Inc. excluding interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes the impact of charges associated with the Toys“R”Us liquidation and severance costs in the first quarter of 2018. As required by SEC rules, we have provided reconciliation on the attached schedule of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Management believes that Adjusted net earnings, Adjusted earnings per diluted share and adjusted operating profit absent the impact of charges associated with the Toys“R”Us liquidation and severance costs in the first quarter of 2018 provides investors with an understanding of the underlying performance of the Company’s business absent these unusual events. Management believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate measures for evaluating the operating performance of the Company because they reflect the resources available for strategic opportunities including, among others, to invest in the business, strengthen the balance sheet and make strategic acquisitions. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, net earnings or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP as more fully discussed in the Company's financial statements and filings with the SEC. As used herein, \"GAAP\" refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nHAS-E\nHASBRO, INC.
