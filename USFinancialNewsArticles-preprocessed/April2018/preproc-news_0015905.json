    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Polaris Industries Inc. (NYSE: PII) announced today that Craig Scanlon has been named president of Transamerican Auto Parts (TAP), effective immediately. Scanlon will succeed Greg Adler, who is assuming a new role as executive vice chairman for TAP. TAP continues to be a strong component of Polaris’ growing Aftermarket segment; Scanlon and Adler will both report to Steve Eastman, president of Aftermarket, Parts, Garments and Accessories for Polaris.\n“For more than 50 years, TAP has led the 4x4 Jeep and truck aftermarket thanks to the vision, leadership and passion of the Adler family. As executive vice chairman, Greg’s extensive industry knowledge, strategic insight, and strong relationships will continue to play a critical role in supporting the long-term success of the business,” said Eastman. “I have full confidence that TAP’s market leadership will continue to grow and flourish with Craig at the helm. Craig has an exceptional track record as a proven leader whose clear, strategic vision has been instrumental in helping to shape and grow Polaris’ largest business segment. His dedication and passion, combined with his experience building brands and delivering results, makes him well equipped to accelerate growth and drive long-term success for TAP and Polaris.”\n“This is an exciting time for the 4x4 Jeep and truck aftermarket industry and I’m humbled by the opportunity to lead this talented TAP team,” said Scanlon. “TAP’s history of industry leadership and culture of customer-first values have been core to its success. I look forward to building upon its strong foundation and continuing to drive momentum and stronger collaboration across all areas of the business including leveraging synergies resulting from the 2016 acquisition.”\nAn experienced leader in the powersports industry, Scanlon most recently served as vice president and chief retail and marketing officer for Off-Road Vehicles (ORV) at Polaris. During his 14 years at Polaris, Scanlon has held positions of increasing responsibility in marketing, sales and general management supporting both the ORV and Slingshot businesses. Prior to his roles at Polaris, Scanlon held various sales and accounting roles at Ingersoll Rand. He earned his bachelor’s degree in accounting from the University of Maryland.\nIn his new role as executive vice chairman, Adler will be responsible for supporting long-range strategy, pursuing inorganic growth opportunities through TAP’s strategic acquisition framework, and serving as a TAP brand ambassador. Adler joined TAP in 1994 and served in various areas of the business before being named TAP’s president and CEO in 2005.\n“My father founded this business in 1961 as a source for Jeep parts. Today, TAP is an industry leader with a growing portfolio. Craig’s vision and enthusiasm leaves me feeling confident in his ability to honor both the Adler legacy and company vision of putting the customer first, while continuing to deliver growth for TAP and Polaris. Craig is inheriting an incredibly talented and dedicated team. The foundation is built for continued success under his highly experienced leadership,” said Adler. “I imagine TAP’s next chapter will see even more success than its last. On a personal level, my new role as executive vice chairman will allow me to focus on an area of work that I’m extremely passionate about: discovering fresh opportunities, new brands, and untapped segments for TAP.”\nTAP is a leader in the growing $10-plus billion Jeep and truck accessory market.
