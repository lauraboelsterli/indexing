Sharma Oli will press India to exchange millions of dollars held in Nepal in banned high-value Indian bank notes during a visit this week to improve ties with its large southern neighbour. GLOBAL TOP NEWS • U.S. expects talks with China as trade fight escalates The United States voiced willingness on Wednesday to negotiate a resolution to an escalating trade fight with China after Beijing retaliated against proposed U.S. tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods by targeting key American imports, but the Chinese ambassador to Washington said it \"takes two to tango.\" • Facebook says data leak hits 87 million users, widening privacy scandal Facebook said on Wednesday that the personal information of up to 87 million users, mostly in the United States, may have been improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, up from a previous news media estimate of more than 50 million. • U.S. plans to sanction Russian oligarchs this week -sources The United States plans to sanction Russian oligarchs this week under a law targeting Moscow for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday, in what could be the most aggressive move so far against Russia's business elite. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) The SGX Nifty nearest-month futures at 10,298.50, up 1.7 percent from its previous close. The Indian rupee is likely to open higher as risk assets rebounded after comments from a U.S. Economic Advisor raised hopes a trade war will be averted. Indian government bonds may trade little changed ahead of the outcome of the Monetary Policy Committee’s meeting today even as investors await a likely increase in limit on foreign investment in India’s debt. The yield on the benchmark 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in a 7.26 percent-7.32 percent band until the rate decision at 2:30 p.m. in Mumbai, a trader with a state-run bank said. GLOBAL MARKETS • Wall Street's three major indexes staged a comeback to close around 1 percent higher on Wednesday as investors turned their focus to earnings and away from a trade conflict between the United States and China that wreaked havoc in earlier trading. • Asian shares bounced from two-month lows as world equities recovered from a selloff triggered by escalating Sino-U.S. trade tensions, with investors hoping a full-blown trade war between the world's two biggest economies can be averted. • The dollar held steady against the yen after recovering against the safe-haven Japanese currency as stocks bounced back from a sell-off triggered by an escalating U.S.-China trade spat. • U.S. Treasury yields rose on Wednesday and stocks recovered much of their earlier losses, after China retaliated against the Trump administration’s plan to impose tariffs on Chinese goods. • Oil prices rose, holding onto a late-session rally the previous day, buoyed by the U.S. government data showing a surprise drawdown in crude stockpiles. • Gold prices fell, after hitting a one-week high in the previous session, as the dollar steadied and equities recovered on the United States's willingness to negotiate on tariffs with China, easing fears of a full-blown trade war.
