    "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Republic Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: RBCAA), headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, is the holding company of Republic Bank & Trust Company (the “Bank”).\nRepublic Bancorp, Inc. (“Republic” or the “Company”) is pleased to report first quarter net income of $27.5 million, a 37% increase over the first quarter of 2017, resulting in Diluted Earnings per Class A Common Share (“Diluted EPS”) of $1.32. Return on average assets (“ROA”) and return on average equity (“ROE”) were 2.08% and 17.12%, respectively, for the first quarter of 2018.\nThe Company’s performance metrics for the first quarter of 2018 were positively impacted by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) (1) , which, among other things, lowered the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. Pre-tax earnings increased 16% year over year, as the Company estimates that the lower effective tax rate benefitted its first quarter 2018 metrics by increasing net income approximately $4.0 million, Diluted EPS by $0.19, ROA by 0.30%, and ROE by 2.47%.\nSteve Trager , Chairman & CEO of Republic commented, “I am delighted to see continued growth in our overall net income for the quarter. While we certainly welcome the after-tax benefits of the lower tax rate, I am particularly pleased with the 16% year-over-year growth in our pre-tax earnings, which reflects positively on our ability to execute our long-term growth strategies.\n“As is typically the case during the first quarter of each year, our seasonally strong Tax Refund Solutions (‘TRS’) segment of our Republic Processing Group (2) (‘RPG’) operations made a substantial contribution. TRS earned net income of $12.4 million for the first quarter of 2018 while completing the bulk of our tax season. Additionally, the Republic Credit Solutions (‘RCS’) segment of RPG continued to produce solid earnings, contributing $3.9 million to RPG’s net income for the quarter.\n“In addition to the solid net income at RPG, first quarter 2018 Core Banking (3) net income grew 31% over the first quarter of 2017, driven by net interest margin expansion, which was complemented by solid year-over-year growth in average outstanding loan balances,” concluded Steve Trager.\nThe following table highlights Republic’s financial performance for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017:\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data) Three Months Ended Mar. 31, 2018 2017 $ Change % Change Income Before Income Taxes* $ 34,910 $ 30,071 $ 4,839 16 % Net Income* 27,469 20,017 7,452 37 Diluted Earnings per Class A Common Stock 1.32 0.96 0.36 38 Return on Average Assets 2.08 % 1.65 % NA 26 Return on Average Equity 17.12 13.12 NA 30 NA – Not applicable\n*See Segment Data at the End of this Earnings Release\nResults of Operations for the First Quarter of 2018 Compared to the First Quarter of 2017\nCore Bank (3) – Net income from Core Banking was $11.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $2.6 million, or 31%, over the first quarter of 2017, with the previously mentioned lower 2018 effective tax rate contributing approximately $1.5 million to the increase. In addition to the lower effective tax rate, the increase in net income at the Core Bank was primarily driven by strong growth in net interest income, which increased $5.2 million, or 14%, over the first quarter of 2017. The growth in net interest income was propelled by a 22-basis-point expansion of the Core Bank’s net interest margin for the first quarter of 2018 to 3.55% and further complemented by a $247 million, or 7%, increase in the Core Bank’s quarterly average loans.\nThe overall change in the Core Bank’s net interest income, as well as average and period-end loan balances by origination channel, is presented below:\nNet Interest Income for the (dollars in thousands) Three Months Ended\nMar. 31,\nOrigination Channel 2018 2017 $ Change\n% Change\nTraditional Network $ 37,934 $ 32,067 $ 5,867 18 % Warehouse Lending 3,591 3,900 (309 ) (8 ) Correspondent Lending 260 281 (21 ) (7 ) 2012-FDIC Acquired Loans 66 380 (314 ) (83 ) Total Core Bank $ 41,851 $ 36,628 $ 5,223 14 Average Loan Balances Period-End Loan Balances (dollars in thousands) Three Months Ended\nMar. 31,\nMar. 31, Origination Channel 2018 2017 $ Change\n% Change 2018 2017 $ Change\n% Change Traditional Network $ 3,307,756 $ 3,033,392 $ 274,364 9 % $ 3,322,017 $ 3,017,051 $ 304,966 10 % Warehouse Lending 448,039 436,459 11,580 3 534,959 495,165 39,794 8 Correspondent Lending 114,156 145,068 (30,912 ) (21 ) 111,263 141,375 (30,112 ) (21 ) 2012-FDIC Acquired Loans 6,443 14,371 (7,928 ) (55 ) 6,065 14,078 (8,013 ) (57 ) Total Core Bank $ 3,876,394 $ 3,629,290 $ 247,104 7 $ 3,974,304 $ 3,667,669 $ 306,635 8\nThe primary drivers of the changes in the Core Bank’s average loan balances and net interest income for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the first quarter of 2017 follow:\nThe Traditional Network experienced solid growth in average loan balances of $274 million, or 9%, from the first quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018. This growth was largely concentrated in the commercial loan sector, with average commercial real estate balances growing $169 million, or 16%, and average commercial and industrial balances growing $75 million, or 31%. The yield on the Traditional Network loans expanded 26 basis points to 4.51% during the first quarter of 2018 from 4.25% during the first quarter of 2017. As expected, yields on variable rate portfolios that frequently reprice to an index, such as the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate, reflected greater expansion than their fixed or adjustable rate counterparts. The fluctuation in net interest income related to the Warehouse Lending (“Warehouse”) segment was related to an internal change in the way the Company assigns a cost of funds to Warehouse through its Funds Transfer Pricing (“FTP”) methodology. The Company changed its Warehouse FTP methodology during the first quarter of 2018 to be more consistent with the FTP methodology used for other Core Bank loan products with similar pricing and duration characteristics.\nThe Core Bank’s provision for loan and lease losses (“Provision”) increased to $960,000 for the first quarter of 2018 from a very low $241,000 for the same period in 2017. The primary drivers of the increase in Provision expense were an increase of four basis points in annualized net charge-offs and higher general reserves related to stronger loan growth in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017. Overall, the Core Bank’s credit quality metrics remained strong from period to period.\nThe Core Bank’s credit quality metrics are presented in the table below:\nAs of and for the: Quarters Ended: Years Ended: Mar. 31, Mar. 31, Dec. 31, Dec. 31, Dec. 31, Core Banking Credit Quality Ratios 2018 2017 2017 2016 2015 Nonperforming loans to total loans 0.37 % 0.46 % 0.36 % 0.42 % 0.66 % Nonperforming assets to total loans (including OREO) 0.38 0.50 0.36 0.46 0.70 Delinquent loans to total loans(4) 0.21 0.16 0.21 0.18 0.35 Net charge-offs to average loans 0.06 0.02 0.04 0.05 0.05 (Quarterly rates annualized) OREO = Other Real Estate Owned Noninterest income for the Core Bank was $8.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, a $425,000, or 5%, increase from the $7.9 million achieved during the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily driven by the following:\nService charges on deposits increased $269,000, or 8%, consistent with an 8% increase in active checking accounts from March 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018. Interchange fee income increased $375,000, or 15%, with debit card interchange fees up $231,000, or 12%, and credit card interchange fees up $144,000, or 29%. The increase in interchange fees was driven by increases of 6% in active debit cards and 18% in active credit cards over the previous 12 months, as well as the corresponding usage on those cards.\nCore Bank noninterest expenses increased $3.4 million, or 11%, during the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily driven by the following:\nSalaries and employee benefits expense increased $2.1 million, or 11%, driven partially by annual merit increases, partially by an increase of approximately 21 Core Bank full-time-equivalent employees (“FTEs”) over the previously 12 months, and partially by a $763,000 increase in healthcare benefits. The additional FTEs were added primarily to support Core Bank strategic initiatives. Occupancy expense increased $339,000, or 8%, primarily driven by a 23% increase in depreciation expense associated with banking center renovations over the previous year. Data processing expenses increased $608,000, or 44%, driven by new and upgraded third-party technology implemented in the previous 12 months to support several key strategic Core Bank initiatives. Such initiatives include improving the Company’s client relationship management system, its online-banking functionality, and its overall information security.\nRepublic Processing Group (2)\nRepublic Processing Group (“RPG”) reported net income of $16.3 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $11.5 million for the same period in 2017, with the previously mentioned lower 2018 effective tax rate contributing approximately $2.5 million to the increase. In addition to the lower effective tax rate, RPG’s net income growth from the same quarter in 2017 was also driven by strong revenue growth within the RCS segment and partially by an increase in net Refund Transfer (“RT”) revenues within the TRS segment.\nWithin the RCS segment, net income increased $2.6 million and was driven by revenue growth from its short-term consumer loan products over the previous 12 months. Profitability growth was concentrated in RCS’s line-of-credit product, with loan fees for this product increasing $1.7 million, or 37%, from the first quarter of 2017. Additionally, Provision expense for RCS’s line-of-credit product decreased $1.3 million from the first quarter of 2017, as net charge-offs to-date within the portfolio have continued to season and have remained within an expectedly and relatively narrow range for a consistent period of time.\nWithin the TRS segment, net income increased $2.3 million compared to the same period in 2017. TRS experienced a $970,000, or 6%, increase in net RT revenues compared to the first quarter of 2017, consistent with a 6% increase in the number of RTs funded when comparing the two periods.\nOffsetting the income growth discussed above, TRS’s net EA revenues (EA fees, less estimated loan loss provisions for EAs) was $1.1 million lower than the first quarter of 2017, as the Company has currently reserved higher amounts for estimated loan losses in the product. TRS originated $430 million of EAs during the first quarter of 2018 compared to $329 million for the same period in 2017. While the increase in EA originations drove an increase in EA fee income of $3.6 million, the Company has experienced, thus far, slower repayment of EAs from the federal government, resulting in higher estimated loan loss reserves. These higher estimated reserves drove a $4.7 million increase in EA Provision expense.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had reserved through its loan loss provision approximately 3.09% of total EA originations for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 2.62% of total EA originations for the same period in 2017. Each 0.10% in estimated reserves equates to approximately $430,000 in Provision expense.\nRepublic Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) is the parent company of Republic Bank & Trust Company (the “Bank”).

Financial Information\nFirst Quarter 2018 Earnings Release (continued)\nSegment Data:\nReportable segments are determined by the type of products and services offered and the level of information provided to the chief operating decision maker, who uses such information to review performance of various components of the business (such as banking centers and business units), which are then aggregated if operating performance, products/services, and clients are similar.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company was divided into five reportable segments: Traditional Banking, Warehouse Lending (“Warehouse”), Mortgage Banking, Tax Refund Solutions (“TRS”), and Republic Credit Solutions (“RCS”). Management considers the first three segments to collectively constitute “Core Bank” or “Core Banking” operations, while the last two segments collectively constitute Republic Processing Group (“RPG) operations. The Bank’s Correspondent Lending channel and the Company’s national branchless banking platform, MemoryBank ® , are considered part of the Traditional Banking segment.\nPrior to the third quarter of 2017, management reported RPG as a segment consisting of its largest division, TRS, along with its relatively smaller divisions, Republic Payment Solutions (“RPS”), and RCS. During the third quarter of 2017, due to RCS’s growth in revenues relative to the total Company’s revenues, management identified TRS and RCS as separate reportable segments under the newly classified RPG operations. Also, as part of the updated segmentation, management will report the RPS division, which remained below thresholds to be classified a separate reportable segment, within the newly classified TRS segment. The reportable segments within RPG operations and divisions within those segments operate through the Bank. All prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.\nThe nature of segment operations and the primary drivers of net revenues by reportable segment are provided below:\nReportable Segment: Nature of Operations: Primary Drivers of Net Revenues: Core Banking: Traditional Banking Provides traditional banking products to clients primarily in its market footprint via its network of banking centers and to clients outside of its market footprint primarily via its Digital and Correspondent Lending delivery channels. Loans, investments, and deposits. Warehouse Lending Provides short-term, revolving credit facilities to mortgage bankers across the United States. Mortgage warehouse lines of credit. Mortgage Banking Primarily originates, sells and services long-term, single family, first lien residential real estate loans primarily to clients in the Bank's market footprint. Loan sales and servicing. Republic Processing Group: Tax Refund Solutions TRS offers tax-related credit products and facilitates the receipt and payment of federal and state tax refund products. The RPS division of TRS offers general-purpose reloadable cards. TRS and RPS products are primarily provided to clients outside of the Bank’s market footprint. Loans, refund transfers, and prepaid cards. Republic Credit Solutions Offers short-term credit products. RCS products are primarily provided to clients outside of the Bank’s market footprint, with a substantial portion of RCS clients considered subprime or near prime borrowers. Unsecured small-dollar, consumer loans. The accounting policies used for Republic’s reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in the Company’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Segment performance is evaluated using operating income. Goodwill is allocated to the Traditional Banking segment. Income taxes are generally allocated based on income before income tax expense unless specific segment allocations can be reasonably made. Transactions among reportable segments are made at carrying value.\nRepublic Bancorp, Inc.

Financial Information\nFirst Quarter 2018 Earnings Release (continued)\n(1)\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) was enacted on December 22, 2017 and, among other things, lowered the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. With the first quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2017 largely impacted by the TCJA, the Company’s effective tax rate per quarter was as follows: 21.3% (quarter ended March 31, 2018); 70.9% (quarter ended December 31, 2017); 34.9% (quarter ended September 30, 2017); 34.0% (quarter ended June 30, 2017); and 33.4% (quarter ended March 31, 2017).\nThe relatively high effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 was driven by a $6.3 million charge to income tax expense due to the remeasurement of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities at a 21% corporate tax rate.\n(2)\nRepublic Processing Group operations consist of the Tax Refund Solutions and Republic Credit Solutions segments.\n(3)\n“Core Bank” or “Core Banking” operations consist of the Traditional Banking, Warehouse Lending, and Mortgage Banking segments.\n(4)\nThe delinquent loans to total loans ratio equals loans 30-days-or-more past due divided by total loans. Depending on loan class, loan delinquency is determined by the number of days or the number of payments past due.\n(5)\nThe amount of loan fee income can meaningfully impact total interest income, loan yields, net interest margin, and net interest spread. The amount of loan fee income included in total interest income per quarter was as follows: $26.9 million (quarter ended March 31, 2018); $9.4 million (quarter ended December 31, 2017); $9.1 million (quarter ended September 30, 2017); $6.4 million (quarter ended June 30, 2017); and $21.3 million (quarter ended March 31, 2017).\nInterest income for Easy Advances (“EAs”) is composed entirely of loan fees. The loan fees disclosed above included EA fees of $17.8 million and $14.2 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. EAs are only offered during the first two months of each year.\n(6)\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of total stockholders’ equity in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) to tangible stockholders’ equity in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, a non-GAAP disclosure. The Company provides the tangible book value per share, a non-GAAP measure, in addition to those defined by banking regulators, because of its widespread use by investors as a means to evaluate capital adequacy.\nQuarterly Comparison (dollars in thousands, except per share data) Mar. 31, 2018 Dec. 31, 2017 Sep. 30, 2017 Jun. 30, 2017 Mar. 31, 2017 Total stockholders' equity - GAAP (a) $ 653,254 $ 632,051 $ 633,287 $ 626,891 $ 620,664 Less: Goodwill 16,300 16,300 16,300 16,300 16,300 Less: Mortgage servicing rights 4,925 5,044 5,128 5,159 5,158 Less: Core deposit intangible 807 858 911 964 1,017 Tangible stockholders' equity - Non-GAAP (c) $ 631,222 $ 609,849 $ 610,948 $ 604,468 $ 598,189 Total assets - GAAP (b) $ 5,078,334 $ 5,085,362 $ 4,993,174 $ 4,955,661 $ 4,664,792 Less: Goodwill 16,300 16,300 16,300 16,300 16,300 Less: Mortgage servicing rights 4,925 5,044 5,128 5,159 5,158 Less: Core deposit intangible 807 858 911 964 1,017 Tangible assets - Non-GAAP (d) $ 5,056,302 $ 5,063,160 $ 4,970,835 $ 4,933,238 $ 4,642,317 Total stockholders' equity to total assets - GAAP (a/b) 12.86 % 12.43 % 12.68 % 12.65 % 13.31 % Tangible stockholders' equity to tangible assets - Non-GAAP (c/d) 12.48 % 12.04 % 12.29 % 12.25 % 12.89 % Number of shares outstanding (e) 20,888 20,850 20,861 20,861 20,858 Book value per share - GAAP (a/e) $ 31.27 $ 30.31 $ 30.36 $ 30.05 $ 29.76 Tangible book value per share - Non-GAAP (c/e) 30.22 29.25 29.29 28.98 28.68 (7)\nThe efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP measure, equals total noninterest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. The ratio excludes net gains (losses) on sales, calls, and impairment of investment securities, if applicable.\n(8)\nThe cost of average deposits ratio equals annualized total interest expense on deposits divided by total average interest-bearing deposits plus total average noninterest-bearing deposits.\n(9)\nFTEs – Full-time-equivalent employees.\n(10)\nDelinquent loans for the RPG segment included $13 million and $8 million of EAs at March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017. EAs were only offered during the first two months of 2018 and 2017. EAs do not have a contractual due date but are eligible for delinquency consideration three weeks after the taxpayer-customer’s tax return is submitted to the applicable tax authority. All unpaid EAs are charged-off by the end of the second quarter of each year.\nNM – Not meaningful\nView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180419005084/en/\nRepublic Bancorp, Inc.\nKevin Sipes, 502-560-8628\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nSource: Republic Bancorp, Inc.",
