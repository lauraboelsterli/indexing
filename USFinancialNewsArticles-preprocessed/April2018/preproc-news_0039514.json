    "text": "LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” The Latest on an announcement that the largest manufacturer of bump stocks will shut down its website and stop taking orders (all times local):\n2 p.m.\nA gun control group says news that the largest manufacturer of bump stocks will stop accepting orders is a \"positive development.\"\nAvery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, says Wednesday that bump stocks shouldn't be available for sale to the public.\nSlide Fire Solutions posted a message on its website Wednesday saying it would stop taking orders on May 20. It did not elaborate on a reason.\nThe Brady Campaign sued Slide Fire after the devices were used in the Las Vegas massacre that killed 58 people.\nThe lawsuit alleges the devices turn rifles into the \"function equivalent of a machine gun\" and evade federal law.\nGardiner says she hopes the lawsuit will allow the organization to learn more about why Slide Fire is closing and what they plan to do with their patent.\n11 a.m.\nThe manufacturer of bump stock devices like the ones used in the Las Vegas mass shooting last fall is shutting down its business.\nA message posted on the website of Texas-based Slide Fire says the company will stop taking orders at midnight on May 20.\nA bump stock fits over the stock and grip of a semi-automatic rifle, allowing the weapon to fire continuously.\nBump stocks were found among the weapons used by Stephen Paddock as he shot from his 32nd-floor hotel room on Oct. 1, killing 58 people at a concert and wounding hundreds.\nSlide Fire says orders placed prior to May 20th, 2018 will be processed and shipped.\nThe Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence sued makers and sellers of the devices shortly after the massacre.",
