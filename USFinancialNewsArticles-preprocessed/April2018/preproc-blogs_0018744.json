    "text": "A project by campaigning organization \"Reporters Without Borders\" that put messages criticizing world leaders on billboards that appeared on Google Street View has had the images removed by the tech company.\nEarlier this week, people browsing Moscow's Red Square via Street View on maps.google.se would have seen a huge black-and-white billboard right next to St Basil's Cathedral stating: \"Being gay is normal.\"\nThe Quote: is from an interview with a school teacher who stated \"homosexuality is normal\" in Russian newspaper Molodai Dalnevostochnik.

But the consequences remain the same, important voices for free speech have been silenced in the places where they are needed the most.\"\nAnother huge poster \"appeared\" on Broadway, right by Times Square in New York City, stating \"Russia won the White House for you, Donald Trump,\" taken from a statement on Twitter from writer Rebecca Buckwalter-Poza, who was blocked by the president after she tweeted a message at him. She was then part of a group that",
