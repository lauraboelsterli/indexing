    "text": "MOSCOW, April 3 (Reuters) - Russian oil pipeline operator Transneft has suspended talks with Summa group over the purchase of a stake in Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port (NCSP) but is still interested in raising its stake in the asset, Transneft spokesman Igor Dyomin said.\nThe negotiations were suspended due to the “latest events”, Dyomin said in a statement without elaborating. On Saturday, the Russian authorities arrested the co-owner of Summa, Ziyavudin Magomedov, on charges of embezzling more than $35 million.\nMagomedov denied the charges at a pre-trial hearing, where a judge ordered that he be held in custody until May 30.
