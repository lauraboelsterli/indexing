I don’t think its going to indict the entire sector,” said Luschini.\nAt 8:47 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 135 points, or 0.55 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were up 13.5 points, or 0.51 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 26.75 points, or 0.4 percent.\nCoca-Cola gained 0.7 percent after its revenue beat estimates, helped by higher demand for Coke Zero Sugar and new flavors of Diet Coke. Verizon jumped 3.4 percent after its profit beat expectations.\nStill, not all results from industrial companies or Dow components were strong. 3M fell 4.5 percent after it managed to only match profit estimates.\nA drop in sales for the screen glass unit of telecoms parts producer Corning Inc may also add to growing market nerves about demand for high-end smartphones.\nTen-year bond yields were at 2.9864 percent, still at four-year highs, but lower than the peak of 2.9980 percent hit on Monday due to a growing supply of government debt and accelerating inflation as commodity prices gained.\nOil rose above $75 a barrel to its highest since November 2014, supported by OPEC-led production cuts, strong demand and the prospect of renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran.
