    "text": "SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tandem Diabetes Care®, Inc. (NASDAQ: TNDM), a medical device company and manufacturer of the only touchscreen insulin pumps available in the United States, today reported its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nIn comparing the first quarter of 2018 to the same period of 2017:\nPump shipments increased 58 percent to 4,444 pumps from 2,816 pumps. Sales increased 44 percent to $27.3 million from $19.0 million. The first quarter of 2017 benefited from $1.5 million in previously deferred sales that were recognized during the period 1 . Operating margin improved to negative 57 percent from negative 112 percent.\n“Our first quarter results demonstrate continued positive momentum across all aspects of our business,” said Kim Blickenstaff, President and Chief Executive Officer. “These trends, in combination with our robust product pipeline and the new integrated continuous glucose monitoring opportunities, give us confidence in our ability to achieve both our near and longer-term goals.”\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 increased 69 percent to $11.4 million, compared to $6.8 million for the same period of 2017. The first quarter of 2017 benefited from $0.7 million in previously deferred profit that was recognized during the period 1 . Gross margin was 42 percent for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 36 percent in the same period of 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, operating expenses totaled $26.9 million, compared to $28.0 million for the same period of 2017. Operating loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $15.5 million, compared to $21.2 million for the same period of 2017. Operating margin for the first quarter was negative 57 percent compared to negative 112 percent in the same period of last year. Both operating loss and operating margin included non-cash charges for stock-based compensation of $1.2 million and depreciation and amortization of $1.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to stock-based compensation of $3.0 million and depreciation and amortization of $1.4 million, for the comparable period of 2017.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $32.7 million, compared to $23.8 million for the same period of 2017. In the first quarter of 2018 this included a $14.2 million non-cash charge for the change in fair value of the Series A and Series B warrants issued in the Company’s October 2017 financing. There was no comparable charge in the first quarter of 2017.\nCash Balance and Liquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $81.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. This included $64.2 million in net proceeds from the equity financing completed in February 2018 and $6.5 million in net proceeds from warrants exercised in the first quarter of 2018. The Company generated an additional $11.3 million in net proceeds from Series A and Series B warrant exercises between April 1 and the expiration of the Series B warrants on April 17, 2018. The Company’s 2018 total net proceeds from warrants exercised through April 17 was approximately $17.8 million, of which the vast majority were Series B warrants.\n2018 Annual Guidance\nFor the year ending December 31, 2018, the Company is reaffirming its financial guidance as follows:\nSales are estimated to be in the range of $132 million to $140 million, which represents an annual sales growth of 23 percent to 30 percent compared to 2017. Annual sales for 2017 benefited from $5.0 million in previously deferred sales that were recognized during the period 1 . Operating margin is estimated to be in the range of negative 40 percent to negative 35 percent, which includes: Approximately $4.0 million to $5.0 million in non-cash, stock-based compensation expense. Approximately $7.0 million to $8.0 million of depreciation and amortization.\n1 Beginning in the third quarter of 2016 through the third quarter of 2017, the Company offered a Technology Upgrade Program under a variable pricing structure, as a pathway for certain existing customers to obtain the t:slim X2™ Insulin Pump. This program resulted in a number of accounting complexities that makes comparisons of our current and historical financial results more difficult. In particular, during the term of the program, accounting guidelines required us to defer up to 100 percent of sales at the time of pump shipment and recognize them in a subsequent period, either when the upgrade was fulfilled or at the expiration of the program.\nConference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call and simultaneous webcast today at 4:30pm Eastern Time (1:30pm Pacific Time).
