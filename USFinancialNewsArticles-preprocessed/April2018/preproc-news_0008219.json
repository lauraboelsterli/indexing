    "text": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - Pat Abercrombie, head of North American natural gas for Koch Supply & Trading, has left the company, two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.\nAbercrombie will join Spanish energy firm Repsol, the sources added. He joined Koch in mid-2016 from Pacific Summit Energy, where he was a senior trader, according to his LinkedIn profile.\nRepsol did not immediately respond to a request for comment and a representative for Koch declined to comment, as did Abercrombie.\nKoch Supply & Trading is owned by the billionaire Koch brothersâ€™ firm Koch Resources. The global commodities trader this year cut jobs across offices worldwide in a bid to restructure its business.\nReporting by Liz Hampton; Editing by Tom Brown\n ",
