Dr. Phillips has over two decades of experience in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries, leading commercial operations, clinical medicine, business strategy and development functions. Founder Nikhilesh Singh, Ph.D. has been appointed OrphoMed's Chief Scientific Officer, a newly-created position.\n\"I am excited and honored to lead OrphoMed during this next phase focused on building additional pipeline value,\" said Dr. Phillips. \"Nik has assembled a highly-experienced team and has successfully led the company from initial financing into preclinical studies and now into clinical trials. OrphoMed's dimer platform technology and pipeline of novel therapeutics hold great promise and potential value. I look forward to accelerating this important work of developing and expanding our pipeline of dimer therapeutics to help patients with gastrointestinal disorders.\"\nDr. Phillips joins OrphoMed from Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, where he served as Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer since 2013. Previously, he was Head of Global Health & Healthcare Industries at the World Economic Forum.

I welcome Gary to OrphoMed and am excited to partner with him and this capable team as we focus on developing best-in-class dimer therapeutics for patients.\"\nAbout OrphoMed, Inc.\nOrphoMed is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel first-in-class dimer therapeutics for patients with gastrointestinal disorders.
