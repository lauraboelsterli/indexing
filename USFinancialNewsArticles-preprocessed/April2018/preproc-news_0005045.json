In this capacity, Gibbs will contribute to the firm by offering industry insight, sourcing new investment opportunities, and providing strategic guidance to Silversmith portfolio companies.\n\"We have known Rick for years, having had the opportunity to work with him as he helped to build Dealer.com into one of the most successful vertical market SaaS companies in the country,\" said Todd MacLean, Managing Partner of Silversmith. \"We are thrilled to have the opportunity to work with Rick again. We know entrepreneurs often talk to each other in short-hand based on shared experiences and adding Rick's voice to our platform will be invaluable as we continue to build Silversmith.

Upon Cox Automotive/Autotrader's $4 billion purchase of TRAK in 2015, Gibbs was appointed to the newly created position of Chief Product Officer for all of Cox Automotive.\nGibbs holds a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering with a focus on Software Engineering from Clarkson University. He and his family live in the Burlington, Vermont area where he is an avid enjoyer of the outdoors, particularly telemark skiing.\nAbout Silversmith Capital Partners\nFounded in 2015, Silversmith Capital Partners is a Boston-based growth equity firm with $1.1 billion of capital under management.
