REUTERS/Saumya Khandelwal/Files Jaitley tweeted earlier this week that he was suffering from kidney related problems and infections and that his treatment would be determined by his doctors.\n“Jaitley will be admitted to AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) early morning tomorrow for kidney operation. All formalities are almost over,” a source in his office told Reuters. A source at the government-run facility confirmed the planned surgery.\nJaitley, 65, is a prominent member of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s inner circle.
