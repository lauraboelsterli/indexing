REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo \nLast week, U.S.-based Cargill Ltd said the Villa Gobernador Galvez plant, part of the key Rosario grains export hub, and a plant in Bahia Blanca would remain closed until at least Tuesday because the strikes, which it characterized as frequent and intermittent, left it unable to guarantee safe work conditions. \n“We trust that we will not be obliged to suffer further stoppages,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday. \nThe protests began after the company said it would restructure some of its operations in Argentina - the world’s No. 1 exporter of soyoil and meal - and lay off a “limited group” of workers. \nArgentina is also the world’s No. 3 exporter of raw soybeans and corn.
