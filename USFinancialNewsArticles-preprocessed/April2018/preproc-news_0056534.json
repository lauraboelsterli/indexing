This is our second consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth and we are pleased with the momentum in our business. Growth in our consumables was excellent. Our medical and veterinary reagent disc revenues grew 8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 over the same period last year and 5% in fiscal 2018 over last year. The growth in our reagent disc revenues reflects the continued strength of our core business.\"\nMr. Severson continued, \"To drive our growth strategy and long-term revenues, we significantly increased our investment in research and development and sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 2018, which resulted in lower income during the year. We successfully launched three new products, our i-STAT Alinity, VetScan SA Sediment Analyzer and VetScan FLEX4 Rapid Test, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, complementing our existing portfolio of diagnostic products. The VetScan SA Sediment Analyzer and VetScan FLEX4 Rapid Test contributed over half of our revenue growth in the quarter, reflecting their significance to our business. \"\nMr. Severson concluded, \"During fiscal 2018, we took very important strategic steps forward, including expanding our field sales force, launching six new products and making continued investments in new product innovation. We continued to manage the company conservatively and fund operations, as well as our quarterly dividend, from internally generated cash flow. We look forward to strong growth in fiscal 2019 and we are optimistic about our future.\"\nDividend Declared\nAbaxis today announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share of common stock, to be paid on June 15, 2018, to all shareholders of record as of the close of business on June 1, 2018.

The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Abaxis defines non-GAAP diluted net income per share as net income per share on a diluted basis excluding from net income the recognized gain from the sale of an equity method investment and related costs, including the portion of our income tax provision associated with such gain and excluding from net income the non-cash charge due to a reduction in deferred tax assets as a result of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017. Abaxis uses this non-GAAP financial measure for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding Abaxis' performance and liquidity by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core business operating results or operating performance.
