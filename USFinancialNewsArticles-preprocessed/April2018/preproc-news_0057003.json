    "text": "ATLANTA, April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Atlantic Capital Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACBI) announced net income of $5.0 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $15.3 million, or ($0.60) per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFirst Quarter Highlights (1)\nGrew loans held for investment by $25 million to $1.96 billion from December 31, 2017. Grew commercial and industrial loans by $21 million to $636 million from December 31, 2017. Reported net interest margin of 3.51%, an increase of 12 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017. Reported nonperforming assets to total assets of 0.13% and annualized net charge-offs to average loans of 0.05%. Increased noninterest income $415,000 to $4.0 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Decreased noninterest expense $2.2 million to $18.4 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.\n“These improved results reflect solid growth in our core corporate and business banking activities, higher loan yields, and the benefit of our cost reduction initiatives undertaken in prior quarters. We anticipate continued improvement in operating results throughout 2018 and into next year,” explained Douglas Williams, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nIncome Statement (1)\nNet interest income increased to $21.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $21.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of higher loan yields and higher loan balances. Net accretion income on acquired loans totaled $448,000 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $686,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet interest margin was 3.51% in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 12 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017. The accretion from the acquired loan discount and amortization of time deposit premium contributed 9 basis points to the net interest margin in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 12 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nLoan yields in the first quarter of 2018 increased 13 basis points to 4.74% from the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of the increases in the federal funds rate and 1 month LIBOR, offset by a decrease in accretion income. Accretion income contributed 9 basis points to the loan yield in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 15 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe cost of total deposits in the first quarter of 2018 was 0.57%, an increase of 5 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017. The cost of interest bearing deposits increased 8 basis points to 0.81% from the fourth quarter of 2017, driven by increased competition for deposits.\nThe provision for loan losses was $772,000 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $282,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017. The first quarter included net charge offs of $231,000 compared to a net recovery of $192,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNoninterest income totaled $4.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $415,000 from the fourth quarter of 2017. SBA income increased $459,000 in the first quarter of 2018 from the fourth quarter of 2017 due to a higher volume of SBA loan sales.\n(1) Commentary is on a fully taxable-equivalent basis unless otherwise noted. Consistent with SEC guidance in Industry Guide 3 that contemplates the calculation of tax-exempt income on a tax equivalent basis, net interest income and net interest margin are provided on a fully taxable-equivalent basis, which generally assumes a 21% marginal tax rate for 2018 and 35% for 2017 and prior. We provide detailed reconciliations in the Non-GAAP Performance and Financial Measures Reconciliation table beginning on page 11. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for additional information.\nThe closing on the sale of the Southeastern Trust Company is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2018 and result in a gain of approximately $1.7 million. Quarterly expense savings are expected to be approximately $450,000 to $500,000 but will be offset by an expected decrease in quarterly trust income of approximately $518,000, based on first quarter 2018 results.\nNoninterest expense totaled $18.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $20.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Salaries and employee benefits expense decreased by $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 to $12.1 million and included $1.1 million in severance expense and seasonally higher payroll taxes. Professional fees decreased $448,000 from lower legal and consulting fees. The first quarter of 2018 included a write down on other real estate owned of $227,000 on a previously closed branch.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal loans were $1.96 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $24.9 million from December 31, 2017. Loans held for investment were $1.96 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $25.6 million from December 31, 2017, as commercial and industrial loans grew $20.8 million during the quarter from an increase in new loan originations and increased balances on existing loans.\nAt March 31, 2018, the allowance for loan losses was $19.9 million, or 1.01% of loans held for investment, compared to $19.3 million, or 1.00% of loans held for investment as of December 31, 2017. Annualized net charge-offs to average loans totaled 0.05% in the first quarter of 2018. Nonperforming assets totaled $3.4 million, or 0.13% of total assets, as of March 31, 2018, compared to $4.1 million, or 0.14% of total assets, as of December 31, 2017.\nTotal average deposits for the first quarter of 2018 were $2.15 billion, a decrease of $41.0 million from the fourth quarter of 2017. This decrease was the result of seasonal volatility and a large increase in temporary deposits during the fourth quarter of 2017. Average noninterest bearing deposits accounted for 29.7% of average total deposits compared to 29.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nEarnings Conference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call at 9:00 a.m. EDT on Friday, April 27, 2018, to discuss the financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Individuals wishing to participate in the conference call may do so by dialing 844.868.8848 from the United States and entering Conference ID 89772886. The call will also be available live via webcast on the Investor Relations page of the Company's website, www.atlanticcapitalbank.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nStatements included in this press release include non-GAAP financial measures and should be read along with the accompanying tables, which provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures. Atlantic Capital management uses non-GAAP financial measures, including: (i) operating net income; (ii) taxable equivalent interest income; (iii) taxable equivalent net interest income; (iv) taxable equivalent net interest margin; (v) operating income before taxes; (vi) operating income tax expense; (vii) operating return on average assets; (viii) operating return on average equity; (ix) tangible common equity; (x) operating diluted earnings per share; and (xi) tangible book value per common share, in its analysis of the Company's performance. Operating net income excludes the revaluation of net deferred tax assets. Tangible common equity excludes goodwill and other intangible assets from shareholders' equity.\nManagement believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing performance and operations, and enhance comparability with prior periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as determined in accordance with GAAP, and investors should consider Atlantic Capital’s performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the Company. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the results or financial condition as reported under GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains “forward-looking statements” Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
