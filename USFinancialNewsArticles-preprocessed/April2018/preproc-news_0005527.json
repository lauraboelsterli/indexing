    "text": "April 1, 2018 / 11:26 AM / Updated 5 hours ago Hotel collapse in Madhya Pradesh kills 10, two injured Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - Ten people were killed and two were injured when a four-storey hotel collapsed in a crowded part of Indore in Madhya Pradesh late on Saturday, a local police official said. People remove the debris as they search for survivors at the site of a collapsed hotel building in Indore, India, March 31, 2018. Picture taken March 31, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer \nRescue operations were complete and no other casualties were likely, assistant sub-inspector Ramesh Kirade told Reuters by telephone. \nWhile the building was old, the reason for its collapse was not immediately known, Kirade said. \nAccording to local news reports, the building collapsed after a heavy vehicle rammed into it. \nBuilding collapses are common in India, where unscrupulous builders and officials often dodge regulations or overlook the need to renovate old structures. \nIn August, a 117-year-old building collapsed in the financial hub of Mumbai killing at least 22 people.
