With best-in-class drill bit performance, service quality, and design capabilities, PDC Logic is well-positioned to quickly capture market share,\" said Mr. Dyer. \"I look forward to working with this great team and leading the company through an exciting phase of growth and innovation.\"\nMr. Dyer holds a Ph.D. in business from Oklahoma State University and a Master of Business Administration from the University of Alberta.
