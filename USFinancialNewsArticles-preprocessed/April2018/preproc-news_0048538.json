The community will be managed by an affiliate of the fund, which plans to undertake an extensive renovation of the community's amenities and introduce significant home inventory and robust home sales and rental programs.\nPueblo Del Sol is Green Courte's first land-lease community investment since the 2015 sale of American Land Lease, Inc., a fully-integrated operating platform and portfolio of 59 land-lease communities with over 19,000 home sites located in 11 states.

There is clear demand for quality housing at affordable prices in this market and we remain 100% focused on providing value to our customers.\"\nAbout Green Courte Partners, LLC\nGreen Courte Partners, LLC is a Chicago-based private equity real estate investment firm focused on building industry-leading companies within niche real estate sectors, including land-lease communities, near-airport parking facilities, and active adult/independent senior living properties.
