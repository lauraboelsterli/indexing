FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Premier League - Stoke City v Burnley - bet365 Stadium, Stoke-on-Trent, Britain - April 22, 2018 Stoke City manager Paul Lambert after the match Action Images via Reuters/Ed Sykes\nStoke are second from bottom with 29 points from 35 games and in danger of dropping into the Championship.\nLambert, however, said his players had to find a way to get the results necessary to give them hope of staying in the top flight.\n“There is an enormous amount of pressure on us, but we have got no other option than to thrive under it,” a bullish Lambert told reporters ahead of Saturday’s clash with third-placed Liverpool.\n“We are in a situation where we really need to win all three of our final fixtures to have a chance. We certainly have to win two definitely, just to give ourselves a glimmer of hope.\n“Realistically though we need three wins. If we do that then I believe we will stay in this league, so there is real pressure on us to try and deliver that.”\nStoke are winless in their last 11 league games although they have secured 1-1 draws against West Ham United and Burnley in their last two games.\n“Personally I love the pressure.... every player, manager has to work under pressure, that is the nature of the business we are in,” Lambert added.\n“As a group we won’t be affected by it. We all know what is at stake. We aren’t frightened by it, we are going to embrace this and give it our best shot.” Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Toby Davis",
