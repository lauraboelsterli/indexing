    "text": "The Colorado Rockies emerged from a benches-clearing brawl to score five runs in the bottom of the third inning Wednesday afternoon en route to a 6-4 victory over the visiting San Diego Padres at Coors Field.\nFive players were ejected following the brawl, which started when Padres right-handed starter Luis Perdomo threw his first pitch of the third inning behind the back of Rockies All-Star third baseman Nolan Arenado. Both benches and bullpens rushed the field.\nPerdomo and catcher A.J. Ellis were the Padres ejected. Arenado, who charged the mound after Perdomo’s pitch, starting pitcher German Marquez and left fielder Gerardo Parra were the Rockies ejected.\nPerdomo had also hit Trevor Story in the first inning Wednesday.\nEarlier Wednesday, the Padres placed center fielder Manuel Margot on the 10-day disabled list with bruised ribs after he was hit by a 95-mph fastball thrown by Scott Oberg on Tuesday night. Marquez hit Hunter Renfroe with a pitch in the second inning Wednesday. And Oberg hit Christian Villanueva with a pitch April 3 during the Padres’ third baseman’s three-homer game.\nAfter order was restored Wednesday, Ian Desmond, who pinch-hit for Arenado, reached on a throwing error by third baseman Cory Spangenberg, stole second and scored on Carlos Gonzalez’s single for the game’s first run. Left-handed reliever Buddy Baumann issued two walks to load the bases with two runs scoring on Tony Wolters’ single and another scoring on an error. Pat Valaika singled home the inning’s final run.\nFranchy Cordero, who was recalled from a rehab assignment to replace Margot on the Padres’ roster, homered leading off the Padres’ three-run sixth. Eric Hosmer, who doubled and scored in the sixth, hit his first homer as a Padre in the eighth to cut the margin to 6-4.\nDJ LeMahieu, who was 3-for-5, scored the Rockies’ final run after opening the bottom of the sixth with a double.\nRight-hander Antonio Senzatela, who followed Marquez, was credited with the win to even his record at 1-1. He allowed three runs (two earned) on four hits and a walk with four strikeouts in three innings. Closer Wade Davis was credited with his fifth save.\nBaumann (0-1) suffered the loss. Only two of the five runs charged against him were earned.\nThe loss snapped a three-game losing streak by the Rockies.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
