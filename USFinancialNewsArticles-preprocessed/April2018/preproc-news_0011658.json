Baltimore State income tax rate: 4.75 percent\nLocal income tax rate: 3.2 percent\nAverage property tax rate: 1.52 percent\nBaltimore is among the least tax-friendly cities, due in no small part to the high local income tax rate of 3.2 percent.

Cleveland State income tax rate: 2.97 percent\nLocal income tax rate: 2 percent\nAverage property tax rate: 2.27 percent\nCleveland has the lowest median household income of the 52 cities at $27,551.

Louisville, Ky. State income tax rate: 5.8 percent\nLocal income tax rate: 2.2 percent\nAverage property tax rate: 0.94 percent\nLouisville's property tax rates are relatively modest, but its local and state income tax rates more than counterbalance that.\n43.

Chicago State income tax rate: 4.95 percent\nLocal income tax rate: 0 percent\nAverage property tax rate: 2.01 percent\nThe Windy City rises up the list of the least tax-friendly cities due almost entirely to its average property tax rate of more than 2 percent.\n41.

District income tax rate: 8.5 percent\nLocal income tax rate: 0 percent\nAverage property tax rate: 0.57 percent\nThe nation's capital is the only East Coast city to appear among the top five for median household income: $75,000 a year.\n30.
