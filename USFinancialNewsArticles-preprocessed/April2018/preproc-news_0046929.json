    "text": "Viacom reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue on Wednesday, as moves to sell rather than release its movies returned Paramount Pictures to profitability.\nTo insulate itself from box-office misses, Paramount has sold some of its hotter properties this year, giving \"The Cloverfield Paradox\" to Netflix , along with international rights to horror movie \"Annihilation.\"\n\"At Paramount Pictures, turnaround efforts have firmly taken hold as the studio improved margins and returned to profitability,\" CEO Bob Bakish said in a statement.\nViacom, which is exploring a merger with CBS , said total domestic affiliate revenue, the fees it collects from U.S. cable and satellite operators and online distributors, fell 4 percent to $934 million in the second quarter.\nAnalysts on average had expected a 4.2 percent drop in domestic affiliate revenue, according to financial and data analytics firm FactSet.\nNet income attributable to Viacom rose to $256 million, or 64 cents per share, in the second quarter ended March 31 from $121 million, or 30 cents per share, a year earlier.\nOn an adjusted basis, the company earned 92 cents per share.\nTotal revenue fell 3.3 percent to $3.15 billion.\nAnalysts on average had expected a profit of 79 cents per share and revenue of $3.03 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nViacom and CBS, both owned by Sumner and Shari Redstone's family company, National Amusements, set up special committees to explore a merger in February, but the two companies have been going back and forth on price and management of a combined company, sources have told Reuters.",
