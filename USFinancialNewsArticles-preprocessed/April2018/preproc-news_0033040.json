    "text": "April 17, 2018 / 10:14 PM / Updated 8 minutes ago Lender CYBG expects to book $288.6 million charge in fiscal half-year results Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - CYBG Plc ( CYBGC.L ) on Wednesday said it expected to take a pre-tax charge of 202 million pounds in its half-year results through March as it increased the provision to cover the cost of an earlier insurance industry scandal. \nThe banking group said in a statement that provisions for covering the cost of the UK’s payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal would increase by £350 million as at March 31. \nThe additional cost would result in a reduction in the Group’s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of about 100 basis points as at Dec. 31, 2017, the lender added in the statement.
