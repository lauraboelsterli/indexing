    "text": "Elon Musk has some interesting plans for the landing of the upper stage of the two-stage Falcon 9 rocket and it involves a “giant party balloon.”\nMusk tweeted Sunday about his plans for the upcoming landing. He started the series of tweets with the acknowledgment that “This is gonna sound crazy,” and then said, “ SpaceX will try to bring rocket upper stage back from orbital velocity using a giant party balloon.” If that wasn’t crazy enough, he followed that tweet up with another zinger, suggesting that the rocket and party balloon will “land on a bouncy house.”\nAnd then land on a bouncy house\n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 16, 2018\nMusk hasn’t provided any additional details on exactly what a “giant party balloon” might entail, but has said that the balloon would have a shape that allows it to withstand the supersonic descent back to Earth , Space.com reports.\nMusk says that a giant balloon is “great for creating a giant object that retains its shape across all Mach regimes & drops ballistic coefficient by 2 orders of magnitude.”\nNo word on when the party balloon and bouncy house will officially be used.",
