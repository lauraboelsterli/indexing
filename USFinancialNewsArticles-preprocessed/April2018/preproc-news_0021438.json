    "text": "Matt Davidson hit a two-run homer with one out in the bottom of the eighth inning as the Chicago White Sox halted a five-game losing streak with a 2-1 victory over the visiting Tampa Bay Rays on Wednesday afternoon.\nDavidson struck out twice to extend his slump to 3-for-26 before lifting a 1-1 changeup from Austin Pruitt (1-2) into the center-field seats well out of the reach of center fielder Kevin Kiermaier.\nJose Abreu, who narrowly missed an extra-base hit in the fifth, set up Davidson’s fifth homer with a single to left field.\nJames Shields overcame five walks and held the Rays to one run and four hits in 6 1/3 innings. Bruce Rondon (1-0) breezed through the eighth for his first win with the White Sox and Nate Jones struck out two in a scoreless ninth for his fourth career save after issuing a leadoff walk to Matt Duffy.\nTampa Bay’s Yonny Chirinos allowed four hits in 5 1/3 scoreless innings. He was in line for his first career win before Pruitt’s misplaced breaking ball.\nC.J. Cron had an RBI double for Tampa Bay, which fell to 2-6 in one-run games and 3-9 overall. It is the Rays’ worst 12-game start in team history.\nChirinos worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the third by striking out Davidson. He also picked Tim Anderson off first for the final out of the fourth and was lifted after Abreu’s sharp lineout.\nChirinos loaded the bases in the third by hitting Abreu with a pitch but ended with the inning by striking out Davidson.\nThe Rays took a 1-0 lead with two outs in the fifth when Cron doubled to deep center field over Adam Engel’s head.\nIn the sixth, Avisail Garcia snapped a 0-for-12 skid with a double, and took third when Kiermaier made a leaping catch of Abreu’s fly ball to the warning track in center field. Jose Alvarado struck out Davidson, and walked Nicky Delmonico before getting Yolmer Sanchez on a forceout.\nWith one out in the seventh, Rays left fielder Mallex Smith was charged with two errors for taking his eye off the ball and making a throwing error by overthrowing second base, allowing Omar Narvaez to reach third. After Chaz Roe hit pinch hitter Leury Garcia in the leg, Narvaez was caught in a rundown and Yoan Moncada struck out.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
