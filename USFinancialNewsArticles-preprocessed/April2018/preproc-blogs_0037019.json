    "text": "Chances are, you are confused about your credit card rewards, frequent flyer programs and hotel loyalty programs.\nAnd that means you're probably leaving real money on the table.\nMany Americans don't understand these programs, according to a new survey from NextAdvisor, which reviews online services.\nMore than half of those surveyed said they are befuddled by frequent flyer programs, followed by hotel loyalty programs and credit card rewards.\nAbout 47 percent of survey respondents said they did not know how many hotel loyalty points they have. Meanwhile, 35 percent don't know their tally of frequent flyer miles, and 35 percent don't understand their credit card rewards.\nSome consumers are not taking the time to sort through those rewards. That goes for 36 percent who are in frequent flyer programs; 33 percent in hotel loyalty programs and 24 percent with credit card rewards.\nThe problem comes from two sources, according to Julie Myhre-Nunes, an analyst at NextAdvisor: companies that do not make it clear how to redeem rewards and consumers who are quick to apply for cards that aren't necessarily the best fit for them.\nHere are several steps you can take to avoid this confusion.\nshow chapters You could be hurting your budget by using the wrong credit card      1 Hour Ago | 01:01 Read the fine print  Make sure you understand exactly what rewards are being offered and how you would redeem them.\n\"Check out the terms and conditions to make sure everything in there is what you need,\" Myhre-Nunes said.\nMake sure the rewards fit your lifestyle Don't sign on for a frequent flyer rewards program for an airline you never fly.\nAnd if you only travel once a year or once every other year, you may not need those rewards. A better alternative: a cash-back rewards card, which lets you redeems those rewards for almost anything, Myhre-Nunes said.\nTake inventory of your existing accounts If you have a rewards account now that you're not sure about, bone up on what's available to you by reading the fine print and/or calling customer service to find out.\nAlso be sure to revisit whether your accounts still match up with your needs at least every couple of years.\nThree years ago, you may have been single and traveling frequently, for example, whereas now you're married and stay home more frequently.\n\"Especially around life changes, think about what your credit card is doing and if it's really the best fit for you,\" Myhre-Nunes said.\nNextAdvisor's online survey was conducted in March and included 2,232 adults ages 18 and up.\nMore from Your Money Your Future: \nYou're probably using the wrong credit card. Here's how to fix that \nThis is how your friends and family members are ruining your credit \nNever, ever purchase these things on your credit card",
