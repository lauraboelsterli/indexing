REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration \nAppleâ€™s report comes a day before the deadline for British employers with more than 250 staff to report their gender pay gap under new regulations. \nThe iPhone maker said the gender pay gap was due to more men in senior positions than women which led to higher pay, bonuses and stock. \nApple said 30 percent of its workforce in the UK was represented by women, with the number having risen from 28 percent in 2014. \nThe company employs more than 6,000 workers in the UK and operates in three segments - Apple (UK) Ltd, Apple Europe Ltd and Apple Retail UK Ltd. \nThe company said it would take a number of measures to close the gaps, such as to stop asking employees for their salary history, which it will start from this year.
