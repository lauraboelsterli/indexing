    "text": "PARIS, April 25 (Reuters) - French hotel group AccorHotels is in talks to buy hotel chain Movenpick Hotels & Resorts, Le Figaro newspaper reported in its Thursday edition.\nThe paper did not provide any further details.\nA spokeswoman for Accor declined to comment.\nMovenpick, which manages 20,000-plus rooms in more than 83 hotels across Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East, could not be reached for comment.\nAccorHotels, Europeâ€™s biggest hotel group, said last week it will make further acquisitions in coming years using cash from the sale of a majority stake in its property business rather than pay a special dividend.
