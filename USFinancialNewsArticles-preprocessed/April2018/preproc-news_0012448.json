REUTERS/Kevin Lam \n“This was a difficult decision between the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350 and A330neo and we thank both manufacturers for their aggressive efforts to earn more of American’s business. In the end, our goal to simplify our fleet made the 787 a more compelling choice,” American Airlines President Robert Isom said in a statement. \nThe deal, at a list price of more than $12 billion, is the latest in a series of heavy blows to the Airbus A330neo. It comes just weeks after Hawaiian Airlines [HAII.UL] dropped an order for six Airbus A330-800neo jets in favour of the 787, leaving that particular variant of long-haul A330neo with no customers. \n“This new order is a powerful endorsement of the 787 family’s unique passenger appeal and unmatched ability to help airlines open new routes and grow profitably,” Boeing Chief Executive Kevin McAllister said in a statement.
