    "text": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - Total SA may restart the gasoline-producing unit at its 225,500-barrel-per-day (bpd) Port Arthur, Texas, refinery by midweek, Gulf Coast market sources said on Monday.\nThe Port Arthur refinery’s two crude distillation units (CDUs) were in operation by Monday night, but were running at reduced production levels, the sources said.\nA leaking pipe on the 76,000-bpd gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) forced the unit’s shutdown on Saturday, according to the sources.\nThe FCCU provides steam used in refining processes and to operate machinery to several units in the refinery.\nAlso shut on Saturday were the 40,000-bpd CDU, the smaller of two at the refinery, the 51,000-bpd vacuum distillation unit (VDU), the 5,000-bpd alkylation unit, a sulfur recovery unit, hydrotreaters and petrochemical processing units.\nThe adjoining BASF SE petrochemical plant was restarting co-generation units that had been shut for a planned overhaul to provide steam to the Total refinery, according to the sources.\nThe smaller CDU was back in operation by Monday night, the sources said.\nTotal declined to comment on refinery operations.\nOnce the FCCU restarts and steam supply is restored, Total can begin restarting the other units, the sources said.\nThe leak was under insulation on a pipe on the FCCU, which may have been caused by corrosion, the sources said.\nA leak under insulation on a pipe led to a large fire on a CDU at Chevron Corp’s Richmond, California, refinery in 2012, the U.S. Chemical Safety Board determined in an investigation. The Chevron Richmond leak was caused by corrosion.\nCDUs do the primary refining of crude oil and provide hydrocarbon feedstock from all other units. VDUs take residual crude oil from CDUs and refine it at vacuum pressure.\nAlkylation units convert refining byproducts into octane-boosting components blended into gasoline.\nHydrotreaters extract hydrogen sulfide from motor fuels in compliance with U.S. environmental rules. Sulfur recovery units extract sulfur from hydrogen sulfide.\nReporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Peter Cooney\n ",
