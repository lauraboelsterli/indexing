    "text": "April 9, 2018 / 3:22 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Motor racing - Injured Ferrari mechanic recovering after surgery Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nMANAMA (Reuters) - A Ferrari mechanic who suffered a broken leg after being hit by Kimi Raikkonen’s car at the Bahrain Grand Prix was recovering after surgery on Monday. \nFrancesco Cigarini posted a picture on Instagram of himself lying in a hospital bed giving a thumbs up gesture and with a plaster cast on the leg. \nThe Italian later posted another of him standing on crutches. \n“Surgery OK. I have to thank all the people worried for me. Nothing else, just a big thanks,” he said. \nCigarini fractured the shinbone and fibula on his left leg after being struck during a botched pitstop, with Ferrari driver Raikkonen given the signal to go before the left rear tyre had been replaced. \nRaikkonen halted immediately in the pit lane and retired from the race while Ferrari team members tended to their stricken colleague. Sebastian Vettel went on to win for the Italian team. \nThe governing FIA later fined Ferrari 50,000 euros ($61,610) for the incident. \n($1 = 0.8116 euros)",
