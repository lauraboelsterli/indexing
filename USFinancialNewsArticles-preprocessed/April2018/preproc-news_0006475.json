    "text": "WASHINGTON, April 5 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump continued his attacks on Amazon.com on Thursday, targeting the newspaper, owned privately by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, as the company’s “chief lobbyist” in a Twitter post.\nTrump, who regularly lashes out against what he perceives as critical articles in the Post and other prominent U.S. news outlets, took issue with a trade story headline on China retaliating with trade penalties against U.S. products.\n“The Fake News Washington Post, Amazon’s “chief lobbyist,” has another (of many) phony headlines,” Trump wrote.
