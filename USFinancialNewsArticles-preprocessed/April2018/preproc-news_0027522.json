    "text": "Philadelphia second baseman Scott Kingery had two hits and three RBIs and Aaron Altherr hit a three-run homer in a five-run eighth inning as the Phillies completed a three-game series sweep with a 10-4 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field on Sunday.\nMaikel Franco had a two-run single in the big eighth inning and Rhys Hoskins had an RBI single and scored twice for the Phillies (9-5), who have won six in a row and eight of their last nine.\nKingery, who signed a six-year, $24 million contract extension on March 25, leads major league rookies with seven doubles, nine extra-base hits and 12 RBIs. He has five doubles, two homers and all 12 RBIs in the last eight games.\nDenard Span had two hits, including his first homer, and two RBIs and Jesus Sucre had two hits and an RBI for the Rays (3-12), off to the worst start in franchise history. They have lost six straight at home.\nRight fielder Altherr made a diving catch on Span’s liner with runners on second and third and two outs in the sixth inning to preserve the Phillies’ 5-3 lead. Altherr was in a 2-for-34 skid entering his eighth inning plate appearance.\nPhiladelphia starter Ben Lively gave up seven hits and three runs in four innings, striking out five without a walk. Yacksel Rios (2-0), the second of five Phillies’ relievers, pitched 1 1/3 innings for the victory.\nLeft-hander Ryan Yarbrough (0-1) gave up three hits and five runs (two earned) in 4 2/3 innings in his first career start, pitching on the fifth of what the Rays’ have designated as “bullpen days” after projected starter Nathan Eovaldi went on the disabled list. Yarbrough struck out two and walked two.\nSpan homered to lead off a two-run first inning. Kevin Kiermaier singled with one out, took second on an error by left fielder Hoskins and scored on Mallex Smith’s two-out triple. Kiermaier jammed his right thumb into the bag on his slide into second base and was removed in the top of the second.\nThe Phillies took a 4-2 lead in the third inning. Andrew Knapp singled and took third on Pedro Florimon’s double to open the inning, and Knapp scored on shortstop Daniel Robertson’s throwing error. Hoskins was hit by a pitch before Kingery doubled off the center field fence to drive in three.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
