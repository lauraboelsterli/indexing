    "text": "April 5, 2018 / 12:34 PM / Updated 5 minutes ago Spanish prosecutor asks judge to prevent Falciani from leaving country Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nMADRID (Reuters) - Spain’s High Court prosecutor on Thursday asked a judge to bar Swiss bank whistleblower Herve Falciani from leaving Spain before a ruling on whether he will be extradited to Switzerland. A police officer stands guard outside Spain's High Court where Swiss bank whistleblower Herve Falciani was to appear before a judge for a ruling on wether he will be extradited to Switzerland, in Madrid, Spain, April 5, 2018.

REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo Related Coverage \nThe prosecutor said in a statement the recommendation to detain him or “take cautionary measures” was made due to the complexity of the case and because it believed Falciani was a flight risk, which had not previously been the case. \nA ruling from the High Court is expected later. \nOn Wednesday, Spanish police arrested the former employee of HSBC’s ( HSBA.L ) Swiss private bank who was convicted of industrial espionage after leaking clients’ tax information. \nThe police acted on an international detention and extradition order from Swiss authorities dated March 19.
