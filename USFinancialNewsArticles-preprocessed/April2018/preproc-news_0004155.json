    "text": "Yangervis Solarte led off the bottom of the eighth inning by hitting the tiebreaking home run as the Toronto Blue Jays beat the New York Yankees 5-3 Saturday afternoon at Rogers Centre in Toronto.\nSolarte snapped a 3-3 deadlock when he drove a 2-0 97-mph fastball well over the center field fence off Dellin Betances (0-1), who also allowed a home run to Kevin Pillar on Thursday.\nSolarte’s first home run for the Blue Jays traveled an estimated 455 feet with an exit velocity of 110.5 mph.\nJustin Smoak had three hits, including an RBI single and run-scoring double off CC Sabathia. Luke Maile added an RBI single as the Blue Jays avoided their first 0-3 start since the 2004 season.\nPillar also stole three bases on Betances in the eighth and scored Toronto’s fifth run on a straight steal of home. Betances was charged with a wild pitch and allowed four stolen bases.\nTyler Austin recorded his first career multi-homer game for the Yankees with a two-run shot in the fifth and a solo drive in the seventh off Toronto starter Marco Estrada.\nThe Yankees were unable to start 3-0 for the first time since 2003 and also lost left fielder Billy McKinney and right-hander Adam Warren to injuries.\nMcKinney sprained his left shoulder in the first inning crashing into the left field wall chasing down a double by Josh Donaldson. Warren injured his ankle in the sixth on a comebacker to the mound.\nBoth players underwent x-rays and the tests came back negative. McKinney joined the Yankees on Friday when Aaron Hicks was placed on the 10-day disabled list with a right intercostal muscle strain.\nEstrada allowed three runs and four hits in seven innings.\nRyan Tepera (1-0) gave up a two-out walk to Giancarlo Stanton but retired Didi Gregorius to end the eighth. Roberto Osuna pitched a perfect ninth and notched his first save.\nSabathia allowed two runs — one earned — and five hits in five innings.\nToronto took a 1-0 lead when Donaldson doubled and scored on a base hit to left by Smoak with one out in the first. The Blue Jays scored an unearned run when Steve Pearce reached on a throwing error by third baseman Brandon Drury and scored on a double by Smoak.\nNew York tied the game when Austin sent a first-pitch fastball from Estrada into the second deck in left field with one out in the fifth. Toronto regained the lead on Maile’s single off Jonathan Holder in the sixth, but Austin homered on a 2-0 fastball into the left field seats with two outs in the seventh.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
