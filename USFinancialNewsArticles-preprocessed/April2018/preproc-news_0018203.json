    "text": "April 10, 2018 / 2:59 PM / Updated 42 minutes ago Soccer - Evergrande's Alan handed eight match ban by Chinese FA Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nHONG KONG (Reuters) - Guangzhou Evergrande’s hopes of defending their Chinese Super League (CSL) title have taken a hit after Brazilian striker Alan was given an eight game ban that will rule him out until after the World Cup in Russia. \nThe 28-year-old striker was given the suspension and a 56,000 yuan ($8,918) fine by the Chinese Football Association after he was sent off during Evergrande’s 1-0 win over Tianjin Quanjian last month for elbowing defender Liu Yiming. \nAlan has scored six times in four league games for Guangzhou this season with his club trailing leaders Shanghai SIPG by three points. \nThe forward has already served the first of his eight game ban and will be available to return to action in Evergrande’s meeting with SIPG on July 21. \nGuangzhou are aiming for a record-extending eighth straight CSL title and have won their last four games in a row in the competition after beginning the campaign with a defeat by city rivals Guangzhou R&F. \nThe club is also competing in the Asian Champions League, which they have won twice, and face Cerezo Osaka next week for a place in the last 16. \nThe suspension of Alan, who has won two league titles since joining the club midway through 2015 from Austrian side Salzburg, does not extend to the continental championship. \n($1 = 6.2793 Chinese yuan renminbi) Reporting by Michael Church, Editing by Christian Radnedge",
