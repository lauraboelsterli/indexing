    "text": "(Reuters) - Syracuse University has permanently expelled a fraternity after a video surfaced this week showing its members using racist and offensive terms in a skit the chapter said was satirical, a school official said on Saturday.\nThe university’s chapter of Theta Tau, an engineering fraternity, has been barred immediately from campus, Chancellor Kent Syverud said in a video statement posted to the university website.\n“The racist, anti-Semitic, homophobic, ableist and sexist video was part of a Theta Tau sponsored event,” Syverud said.\nThe video depicts a group of fraternity members laughing as they use offensive terms for African-Americans, Latinos, and others.\nAfter it became public, the video triggered protests at the private, 22,000-student university located in upstate New York.\nThe fraternity did not immediately respond to an email for comment on the expulsion.\nBut on Friday, the fraternity posted an apology on its website to “everyone affected by the racist video.”\n“Theta Tau is made up of a diverse group of engineering students from a variety of nationalities, beliefs, and backgrounds, and we strongly believe that racism has no place on a university campus,” the statement said.\nThe fraternity went on to say that it is a tradition for the chapter to roast new brothers, and that one of them is a conservative Republican.\n“It was a satirical sketch of an uneducated, racist, homophobic, misogynist, sexist, ableist and intolerant person,” the statement said. “The young man playing the part of this character nor the young man being roasted do not hold any of the horrible views espoused as a part of that sketch.”\nSyverud said that the school is still investigating the incident, and that individual members could be disciplined, including possible suspensions or expulsions.\nThe university also is conducting a “top-to-bottom review of our entire Greek system,” he said.\nReporting by Keith Coffman in Denver; Editing by Stephen Coates\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
