    "text": "0 COMMENTS U.S. government bonds advanced Monday as a decline in stock prices led some investors to seek safety in Treasury debt.\nThe yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note declined for a fourth consecutive session to 2.732% from 2.741% Thursday. Yields fall when bond prices rise.\nTreasury yields, which had fallen toward the end of the March quarter, swung as U.S. stocks began the first day of the second quarter on a downbeat note. Sliding technology shares and rising global trade tensions put pressure on major indexes.\n“Adverse news on the tech sector has promoted bonds ,” said Thomas di Galoma, a managing director and head of Treasury trading at Seaport Global Holdings. “That’s what’s driving the firmness in the Treasury market.”\nInvestor demand for the relative safety of government debt came despite continuing signs that the economy is in solid shape. The Institute for Supply Management said Monday its index of factory activity remained near multiyear highs.\nThe index settled at 59.3 in March, down slightly from 60.8 the prior month. Any reading above 50 indicates rising activity, as measured by factors such as product sales, hiring and production. The latest reading, based on a survey of factories, was slightly below economists’ expectations of a reading of 59.8. In February, the index stood at the highest level since 2004.\nEconomic growth has the potential to hurt the value of bonds by leading investors to prefer riskier assets.\nCorrections & Amplifications\nThe yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year note declined for a fourth consecutive session to 2.732% from 2.741% Thursday. Yields fall when bond prices rise. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the yield direction. (April 2, 2018)\nWrite to Daniel Kruger at Daniel.Kruger@wsj.com",
