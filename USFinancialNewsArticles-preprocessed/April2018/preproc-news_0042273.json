(Farmers) (NASDAQ: FMNB) today reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nNet income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $7.7 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, which compares to $5.8 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and $5.2 million or $0.19 per diluted share for the linked quarter. Annualized return on average assets and return on average equity were 1.45% and 13.03%, respectively, for the three month period ending March 31, 2018, compared to 1.17% and 10.87% for the same three month period in 2017, and 0.96% and 8.60% for the linked quarter. Farmers’ return on average tangible equity (Non-GAAP) also improved to 15.84% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 13.54% for the same quarter in 2017 and 10.69% for the linked quarter.\nOn December 22, 2017, H.R.1, known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” was signed into law. H.R.1, among other things, reduced the corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result of passage of the new tax law, Farmers effective tax rate decreased from 25.43% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 to 14.96% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. It is important to note that also as a result of the new tax law, Farmers determined that its net deferred tax assets needed to be reduced in the fourth quarter of 2017 by approximately $1.8 million, representing an impact on earnings per share of approximately $0.06 per diluted share for that fourth quarter, based on that quarter’s weighted average diluted shares outstanding of approximately 27.5 million.\nKevin J. Helmick, President and CEO, stated, “We are pleased to report record earnings which are a result of the successful integration of previous mergers, continued strong loan growth, higher levels of noninterest income and a lower effective income tax rate.”\n2018 First Quarter Financial Highlights\nLoan growth\nTotal loans were $1.60 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $1.46 billion at March 31, 2017, representing an increase of 9.4%. The increase in loans is a direct result of Farmers’ focus on loan growth utilizing a talented lending and credit team, while adhering to a sound underwriting discipline. The increase in loans has occurred in the commercial and commercial real estate, residential real estate and agricultural loan portfolios. Loans now comprise 78.1% of the Bank's average earning assets for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, an improvement compared to 77.9% for the same period in 2017. This improvement, along with the growth in earning assets, has resulted in an 11% increase in tax equated loan income in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter in 2017. Loan quality\nNon-performing assets to total assets remain at a low level, currently at 0.37%. Early stage delinquencies also continue to remain at low levels, at $7.0 million, or 0.44% of total loans, at March 31, 2018. Net charge-offs for the current quarter were $540 thousand, compared to $583 thousand in the same quarter in 2017 and total net charge-offs as a percentage of average net loans outstanding is only 0.14% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Lending to the energy sector is insignificant and less than 1% of the loan portfolio. Net interest margin\nThe net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 3.92%, a 9 basis points decrease from the quarter ended March 31, 2017. In comparing the first quarter of 2018 to the same period in 2017, asset yields increased 10 basis points, while the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 25 basis points. Most of this increase was the result of higher rates paid on short-term borrowings and time deposits, consistent with increases in the federal funds sold rate. The net interest margin is impacted by the additional accretion as a result of the discounted loan portfolios acquired in the previous mergers, which increased the net interest margin by 4 and 5 basis points for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Noninterest income\nNoninterest income increased 2.1% to $6.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $5.9 million in 2017. Debit card interchange fees increased $153 thousand or 23.4% and trust fees increased $129 thousand or 7.7% in comparing the first quarter of 2018 to the same quarter in 2017. These increases were offset by a drop in retirement plan consulting fees of $134 thousand or 26.1% and gains on the sale of mortgage loans of $120 thousand or 19.8%. Noninterest expenses\nFarmers has remained committed to managing the level of noninterest expenses. Total noninterest expenses of 2018 increased 3.3% to $15.1 million compared to $14.6 million in the same quarter in 2017, primarily as a result of an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $451 thousand and occupancy and equipment expense of $117 thousand, offset by a $128 thousand decrease in other operating expenses and a $49 thousand decrease in professional fees. It is important to note that annualized noninterest expenses measured as a percentage of quarterly average assets decreased from 2.92% in the first quarter of 2017 to 2.83% in the first quarter of 2018. Efficiency ratio\nThe efficiency ratio for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 improved to 57.98% compared to 58.79% for the same quarter in 2017. The main factors leading to this improvement were the increase in net interest income and noninterest income and the stabilized level of noninterest expenses relative to average assets as explained in the preceding paragraphs.\n2018 Outlook\nMr. Helmick added, “We are encouraged by the promising start to 2018 in our financial results. We will focus our energy on the seamless execution of our strategic plan as we remain committed to the businesses and families we serve and to our community banking approach and culture.”\nFounded in 1887, Farmers National Banc Corp. is a diversified financial services company headquartered in Canfield, Ohio, with $2.2 billion in banking assets and over $1 billion in trust assets.
