    "text": "BEIJING, April 3 (Reuters) - China’s ambassador to the United States said Beijing will take counter-measures of the “same proportion” and scale if Washington imposes more tariffs on Chinese goods from a trade probe, state television reported on Tuesday.\nCui Tiankai made the comment in an interview with China Global Television Network.\nIts website Quote: Cui as saying “we will certainly take countermeasures of the same proportion and the same scale, same intensity”.\nHe said the tariffs on U.S. goods that China unveiled on Sunday were in response to the U.S. duties on imports of aluminium and steel, but not the Section 301 investigation.\nReuters reported earlier that President Donald Trump’s administration this week will unveil a list of Chinese imports targeted for U.S. tariffs to punish Beijing over technology transfer policies.
