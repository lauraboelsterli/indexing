    "text": "WAUKEGAN, Ill., April 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Northern States Financial Corporation (OTC PINK:NSFC) (the “Company”), holding company for NorStates Bank (the “Bank”), an FDIC insured financial institution, today reported first quarter 2018 net income after tax of $866,000, an increase of $496,000, or 134.0%, compared to the first quarter 2017 net income after tax of $370,000. The Company’s per share book value at March 31, 2018 was $0.58.\nSome highlights of continued financial improvement during the first quarter of 2018 included the following:\nAverage loans increased by $19.7 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with the first quarter of 2017. Loan interest income increased $325 thousand for the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. The increased loan interest income contributed to a net interest margin for the first quarter of 2018 of 3.45% compared to 3.21% for the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-performing assets (“NPAs”), consisting of nonaccrual loans, ninety days or more past due loans still accruing, loans considered troubled debt restructurings and other real estate owned (“OREO”), decreased by $2.2 million from December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018. At March 31, 2018, the allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans and leases ratio was 2.17%.\nFirst quarter 2018 noninterest income remained relatively stable, increasing $28 thousand compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nFirst quarter 2018 noninterest expense decreased $264 thousand compared to the first quarter of 2017. This decrease was primarily due from reductions to OREO expense of $275 thousand when comparing the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2017 as OREO balances were $1.9 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $10.2 million at March 31, 2017, a reduction of $8.3 million or 81.3%.\nThe Company focused on growing core deposits consisting of personal and business non-time deposits. For the first quarter of 2018, average core deposits increased $10.1 million, or 3.7%, as compared with the first quarter of 2017. Core deposits assist the Company in maintaining a low cost of funds during the first quarter of 2018 at 21 basis points, with the Bank’s cost of funds at 12 basis points.\n“We are encouraged by our solid loan and core deposit growth and increases to earnings. This will remain a focus along with our continued efforts to reduce expenses and NPAs,” stated Scott Yelvington, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nAbout Northern States Financial Corporation\nNorthern States Financial Corporation is the holding company for NorStates Bank, a full-service commercial bank with eight branches in Lake County, Illinois.
