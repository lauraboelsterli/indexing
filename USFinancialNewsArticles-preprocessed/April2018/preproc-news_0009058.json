(NYSE: LW) announced today its third quarter 2018 results and updated its outlook for fiscal 2018.\n“Our strong top- and bottom-line performance in the third quarter reflects the benefits of our capital expansion investments, our focus on delivering industry-leading customer service and our commitment to operational excellence,” said Tom Werner, President and CEO. “Across each of our core businesses, we grew volume and improved price/mix to drive profit growth and expand margins. Our new production line in Richland, Washington is up and running, providing us with greater flexibility across our manufacturing network to support further growth, innovation and limited time offerings for our customers, as well as allowing us to better manage costs, capacity utilization and service levels. In Europe, our joint venture delivered another solid quarter by growing volume and reducing costs. As a result of our strong year-to-date performance and continued expectation of a favorable operating environment, we’ve raised our annual outlook for sales growth and Adjusted EBITDA.”\nSummary of Third Quarter FY 2018 Results ($ in millions, except per share) Year-Over-Year Year-Over-Year Q3 2018 Growth Rates YTD 2018 Growth Rates Net sales $ 863.4 12% $ 2,505.5 7% Income from operations $ 169.2 17% $ 446.6 13% Net income attributable to Lamb Weston $ 156.8 86% $ 316.8 26% Diluted EPS $ 1.06 86% $ 2.14 26% Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures (1) $ 237.6 25% $ 617.9 16% Adjusted Diluted EPS (1) $ 0.91 54% $ 2.01 12% Q3 2018 Commentary\nNet sales were $863.4 million, up 12 percent versus the year-ago period. Price/mix increased 7 percent due to pricing actions and favorable product and customer mix. Volume increased 5 percent, with growth in each operating segment.\nIncome from operations rose 17 percent to $169.2 million from the prior year period, and included $1.7 million of costs related to the spinoff from Conagra Brands, Inc. (formerly ConAgra Foods, Inc., “Conagra”), compared with $5.1 million of expenses incurred in the prior year period related to the spinoff from Conagra.\nExcluding these comparability items, income from operations grew $20.6 million, or 14 percent, driven by higher gross profit. Gross profit increased $36.9 million, due to favorable price/mix and volume, partially offset by packaging, commodity, manufacturing, transportation and warehousing cost inflation, and higher depreciation expense primarily associated with the Company’s new french fry production line in Richland, Washington. The rise in gross profit was partially offset by a $16.3 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, excluding comparability items. The higher SG&A was largely a result of incremental labor and benefits and infrastructure costs associated with being a stand-alone company, higher incentive compensation expense accruals based on operating performance and increased investments in advertising and promotional support.\nAdjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures (1) was $237.6 million, up 25 percent versus the prior year quarter, reflecting growth in income from operations and equity method investment earnings.\nDiluted EPS increased $0.49 to $1.06 from $0.57 in the prior year period. Approximately $0.31 of the increase relates to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) enacted in December 2017, and included a $0.16 benefit from discrete items and a $0.15 benefit related to adopting a lower tax rate. The remaining increase was driven by growth in income from operations and equity method investment earnings.\nAdjusted Diluted EPS (1) increased $0.32 to $0.91 from $0.59 in the prior year period, and includes a $0.15 benefit related to adopting a lower tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. The remaining increase was driven by growth in income from operations and equity method investment earnings.\nThe effective tax rate (2) was 4.5 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, versus 33.4 percent in the prior year period. Compared with the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Tax Act (3) decreased income tax expense by approximately $47 million. This decrease includes a provisional $24.0 million net discrete benefit, comprised of a $38.7 million non-cash benefit from the re-measurement of the Company’s net U.S. deferred tax liabilities using the new U.S. statutory tax rate, partially offset by a $14.7 million transition tax on the Company’s previously untaxed foreign earnings, which is payable over eight years. In addition, the third quarter decrease in tax expense also includes an approximate $23 million tax benefit related to the lower U.S. corporate tax rate, which included approximately $14 million benefit related to earnings reported in the first half of fiscal 2018 and $9 million related to fiscal third quarter earnings. In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company’s effective tax rate, excluding $24.0 million of comparability items arising from the Tax Act, was 18.9%. The Company will continue to refine these amounts within the measurement period allowed by Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 118, which will not exceed one year from the enactment date of the Tax Act.\nQ3 2018 Segment Highlights\nGlobal\nGlobal Segment Summary Year-Over-Year Q3 2018 Growth Rates Price/Mix Volume ($ in mil.) Net sales $ 448.7 15% 9% 6% Segment product contribution margin (1) $ 114.8 23% Net sales for the Global segment, which is comprised of the top 100 North American based restaurant chain customers as well as the Company’s international business, increased 15 percent to $448.7 million. Price/mix increased 9 percent, reflecting price increases as well as improvement in customer and product mix. Volume increased 6 percent, driven by the benefit of significant limited time product offerings and solid growth in sales to strategic customers in the U.S.\nGlobal segment product contribution margin (1) increased 23 percent to $114.8 million, driven by favorable price/mix and volume growth. The increase was partially offset by packaging, commodity, manufacturing, transportation and warehousing cost inflation, as well as higher depreciation expense associated with the new Richland production line.\nFoodservice\nFoodservice Segment Summary Year-Over-Year Q3 2018 Growth Rates Price/Mix Volume ($ in mil.) Net sales $ 253.5 5% 5% 0% Segment product contribution margin (1) $ 90.0 7% Net sales for the Foodservice segment, which services North American foodservice distributors and restaurant chains outside the top 100 North American based restaurant chain customers, increased 5 percent to $253.5 million. Price/mix increased 5 percent, as compared to a 10 percent increase in the prior year quarter, reflecting pricing actions taken in the current year, the carryover effect of pricing actions taken in fiscal year 2017, and improvement in customer and product mix. Volume increased nominally as growth of higher-margin Lamb Weston-branded and operator-labeled products offset the loss of some lower-margin, distributor-label product volumes.\nFoodservice segment product contribution margin (1) increased 7 percent to $90.0 million, driven by favorable price/mix, partially offset by packaging, commodity, manufacturing, transportation and warehousing cost inflation, as well as higher depreciation expense associated with the new Richland production line.\nRetail\nRetail Segment Summary Year-Over-Year Q3 2018 Growth Rates Price/Mix Volume ($ in mil.) Net sales $ 130.2 31% 9% 22% Segment product contribution margin (1) $ 30.5 32% Net sales for the Retail segment, which includes sales of branded and private label products to grocery, mass merchant and club customers in North America, increased 31 percent to $130.2 million. Volume increased 22 percent, primarily driven by distribution gains of Grown in Idaho and other branded products, as well as the timing of shipments of private label products. Price/mix increased 9 percent, due to higher prices across the private label and branded portfolios, as well as improved mix, partially offset by higher trade investments to support expanded distribution of Grown in Idaho branded products.\nRetail segment product contribution margin (1) increased 32 percent to $30.5 million, mainly due to higher volume and price/mix. The increase was partially offset by packaging, manufacturing, transportation and warehousing cost inflation, as well as higher trade investments and advertising and promotional support behind Grown in Idaho branded products.\nEquity Method Investment Earnings\nEquity method investment earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures in the U.S. and Europe were $26.4 million and $12.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. These amounts included a $2.5 million unrealized gain related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts in the current quarter and a $1.4 million loss in the prior year quarter. Excluding these adjustments, earnings from equity method investments increased $9.8 million, driven by solid operating results in Europe and the U.S., including lower raw potato and production costs in Europe, volume growth, an approximate $4 million gain related to a divestiture of a non-core business, and a $2.0 million foreign currency translation benefit.\nOutlook\nThe Company provides earnings guidance on a non-GAAP basis and does not reconcile guidance to GAAP as the Company cannot predict certain elements that are included in reported GAAP results, including costs related to tax reform, the spinoff from Conagra, and other items impacting comparability.\nThe Company updated its outlook for fiscal year 2018 as follows:\nFY 2018 Outlook Summary Net sales growth rate Upper End of Mid-Single Digit Range Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures (1) $805 million-$810 million Interest expense Approximately $110 million Effective tax rate (2) excluding comparability items Approximately 28% Cash used for capital expenditures $270 million-$280 million As summarized in the table above, the Company expects:\nNet sales to grow at the upper end of the mid-single digit range, driven by solid price/mix and volume growth. The Company’s previous estimate was for net sales to grow mid-single digits. Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures (1) to be in the range of $805 million to $810 million, including higher selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2018 due to the full-year impact of incremental labor and benefits and infrastructure costs associated with being a stand-alone public company, higher incentive compensation expense accruals as a result of the Company’s operating performance, and higher advertising and promotional expense in support of the introduction of the Company’s Grown in Idaho product line in retail. Using the mid-point of the range, this represents an increase of approximately 17% percent versus a fiscal 2017 pro forma Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures (1) of $692 million. The Company’s previous estimate was for Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures (1) to be in the range of $780 million to $790 million.\nIn addition, the Company expects:\nTotal interest expense for fiscal 2018 to be approximately $110 million, which is an increase of approximately $50 million from fiscal 2017 due to the full-year impact of the Company’s capital structure after the spinoff from Conagra. The Company’s previous estimate was for total interest expense to be in the range of $105 million to $110 million. A blended estimated effective tax rate (2) excluding comparability items of approximately 28 percent, which reflects the effect of a lower U.S. corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. The Company’s previous estimate was for an effective tax rate of 33 to 34 percent. Cash used for capital expenditures to be between $270 million and $280 million for fiscal 2018, up from the Company’s previous estimate of $250 million. The increase of between $20 million and $30 million reflects the acceleration of spending for the initial phase of construction of a new 300 million pound french fry production line at the Company’s Hermiston, Oregon facility that will support customers’ growth in North America as well as Asia. The Company continues to expect this $250 million production line to be completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.\nEnd Notes\n(1) Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures, pro forma Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures, Adjusted Income from Operations, Adjusted Diluted EPS and segment product contribution margin are non-GAAP financial measures. Please see the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations at the end of this press release for more information. Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures includes $15.0 million of stand-alone public company costs for a full year. See also “Outlook” in this press release for a discussion of the earnings guidance on a non-GAAP basis. (2) The effective tax rate is calculated as the ratio of income tax expense to pre-tax income, inclusive of equity method investment earnings. (3) The Tax Act enacted in December 2017, provided approximately $47 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, of income tax benefits during the third quarter, as follows (dollars in millions, except per share amounts): Income Tax Diluted Benefit EPS Discrete items, net (a) $ 24 $ 0.16 Benefit from lower tax rate (b) Benefit related to earnings reported in first half of fiscal 2018 14 0.09 Benefit related to third quarter fiscal 2018 earnings 9 0.06 23 0.15 Impact of Tax Act $ 47 $ 0.31\n(a) Includes a provisional $24.0 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, net discrete benefit, comprised of a $38.7 million benefit from the estimated impact of remeasuring the Company’s net U.S. deferred tax liabilities on its balance sheet at a lower tax rate, partially offset by a $14.7 million transition tax on its previously untaxed foreign earnings, which is payable over eight years. The Company’s analysis of these items is not complete. The Company will complete the accounting for these items during the measurement period allowed by SAB No. 118, which will not exceed one year from the enactment date of the Tax Act. (b) The Company is required to record the effect of changes in enacted tax laws or rates in the interim period in which the change occurs. Accordingly, the Company recorded an approximate $23 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, benefit from a lower tax rate, in the third quarter. Approximately $14 million of the benefit is attributable to the earnings reported in the first half of fiscal 2018. Since the Company’s fiscal year-end is the last Sunday in May, the impact of the lower U.S. corporate income tax rate is phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal tax rate of approximately 29% for the fiscal year ending May 27, 2018, and a 21% U.S. statutory federal rate for fiscal years thereafter. The Company is estimating an effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, of approximately 28% for the fiscal 2018 full year.

The non-GAAP financial measures provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, financial measures prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") that are presented in this press release. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may differ from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies, and other companies may not define these non-GAAP financial measures the same way. These measures are not substitutes for their comparable GAAP financial measures, such as net income, diluted earnings per share, cash flow from operations, or other measures prescribed by GAAP, and there are limitations to using non-GAAP financial measures.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures to assist in comparing the Company's performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect the Company's underlying operations. Management believes that presenting these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful information because they (i) provide meaningful supplemental information regarding financial performance by excluding certain items, (ii) permit investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate historical performance, and (iii) otherwise provide supplemental information that may be useful to investors in evaluating the Company's results. The Company believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company's business than could be obtained absent these disclosures.\nLamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\nCondensed Combined and Consolidated Statements of Earnings\n(unaudited, dollars in millions, except per-share amounts)\nThirteen Weeks Ended Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended February 25, February 26, February 25, February 26, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (1) Net sales $ 863.4 $ 768.5 $ 2,505.5 $ 2,335.5 Cost of sales 619.5 561.5 1,855.7 1,749.0 Gross profit 243.9 207.0 649.8 586.5 Selling, general and administrative expenses (2) 74.7 61.8 203.2 190.8 Income from operations 169.2 145.2 446.6 395.7 Interest expense, net 28.5 26.3 81.1 34.5 Income before income taxes and equity method earnings 140.7 118.9 365.5 361.2 Income tax expense (3) 7.5 44.0 93.1 129.0 Equity method investment earnings 26.4 12.7 58.5 29.5 Net income 159.6 87.6 330.9 261.7 Less: Income attributable to noncontrolling interests 2.8 3.4 14.1 10.7 Net income attributable to Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. $ 156.8 $ 84.2 $ 316.8 $ 251.0 Earnings per share Basic $ 1.07 $ 0.57 $ 2.15 $ 1.71 Diluted $ 1.06 $ 0.57 $ 2.14 $ 1.70 Dividends declared per common share $ 0.19125 $ 0.18750 $ 0.56625 $ 0.18750 Computation of diluted earnings per share: Net income attributable to Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. $ 156.8 $ 84.2 $ 316.8 $ 251.0 Less: Increase in redemption value of noncontrolling interests in excess of earnings allocated 0.9 0.7 2.2 1.6 Net income available to Lamb Weston common stockholders $ 155.9 $ 83.5 $ 314.6 $ 249.4 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 147.1 146.5 146.9 146.5 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.06 $ 0.57 $ 2.14 $ 1.70\n(1) On November 9, 2016, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc. (“Lamb Weston”) separated from Conagra Brands, Inc. (formerly ConAgra Foods, Inc., “Conagra”) and became an independent publicly-traded company through the pro rata distribution by Conagra of 100% of the outstanding common stock of Lamb Weston to Conagra stockholders (the “Separation”). The combined and consolidated earnings in all periods prior to November 9, 2016, were carved out of Conagra’s consolidated financial statements. These financial statements may not reflect what the Company’s results of operations would have been had it operated as a separate stand-alone public company and may not be indicative of its future results of operations. These financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes in the Company’s fiscal 2017 Form 10-K and fiscal 2018 third quarter Form 10-Q. (2) The thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended February 25, 2018, include $1.7 million and $7.9 million, respectively, of pre-tax expenses related to the Separation as discussed in footnote (1) above. The thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended February 26, 2017, include $5.1 million and $23.8 million, respectively, of Separation-related expenses. In all periods, the expenses related primarily to professional fees and other employee-related costs. (3) The Tax Act decreased income tax expense by approximately $47 million. This decrease includes a provisional $24.0 million net discrete benefit which consists of a $38.7 million non-cash benefit from the re-measurement of the Company’s net U.S. deferred tax liabilities using the new U.S. statutory tax rate, partially offset by a $14.7 million transition tax on the Company’s previously untaxed foreign earnings, which is payable over eight years. In addition, the decrease in income tax expense includes an approximate $23 million tax benefit related to the lower U.S. corporate tax rate. The Company will continue to refine these amounts within the measurement period allowed by SAB No.118, which will not exceed one year from the enactment date of the Tax Act.

(2) The Tax Act decreased income tax expense by approximately $47 million. This decrease includes a provisional $24.0 million net discrete benefit which consists of a $38.7 million non-cash benefit from the re-measurement of the Company’s net U.S. deferred tax liabilities using the new U.S. statutory tax rate, partially offset by a $14.7 million transition tax on the Company’s previously untaxed foreign earnings, which is payable over eight years. In addition, the decrease in income tax expense includes an approximate $23 million tax benefit related to the lower U.S. corporate tax rate. The Company will continue to refine these amounts within the measurement period allowed by SAB No.118, which will not exceed one year from the enactment date of the Tax Act. (3) Items impacting comparability are tax-effected at the marginal rate based on the applicable tax jurisdiction.
