    "text": "JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesiaâ€™s central bank said it will hold a news conference on the development of the rupiah currency at 0930 GMT Thursday.\nIndonesia's Central Bank Governor Agus Martowardojo arrives at a news briefing at the bank's headquarters in Jakarta, Indonesia, April 26, 2018. REUTERS/Willy Kurniawan Governor Agus Martowardojo is due to speak at the news conference.\nThe rupiah has lost nearly 5 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar since late January as a broad rally in the greenback has triggered capital outflows. The central bank has tried to mitigate the risks by buying sovereign bonds and selling foreign currencies.\nReporting by Gayatri Suroyo; Editing by Kim Coghill\n ",
