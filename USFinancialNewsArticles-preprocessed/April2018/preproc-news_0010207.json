    "text": "UNITED NATIONS, April 4 (Reuters) - Russia has requested the United Nations Security Council meet on Thursday to discuss British accusations that Moscow used a nerve agent to attack a former Russian spy in England last month, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said on Wednesday.\nNebenzia said the meeting would be convened on the basis of a March 13 letter sent to the U.N. Security Council by British Prime Minister Theresa May, which said Moscow was “highly likely” responsible for the attack.\nThe 15-member council first met on March 14, at the request of Britain, to discuss the attack in Britain’s Salisbury.\nReporting by Michelle Nichols\n ",
