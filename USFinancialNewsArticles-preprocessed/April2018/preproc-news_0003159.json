    "text": "SHANGHAI, April 2 (Reuters) - China’s Tiangong-1 space station is forecast to re-enter the earth’s atmosphere between 8:11 a.m. and 9:33 a.m. (0011-0133 GMT) on Monday, the country’s space authority said.\nThe craft is expected to land in area around 19.4 degrees west, 10.2 degrees south, the authority said on its website.\nThe 10.4-metre-long (34.1-foot) Tiangong-1, or “Heavenly Palace 1”, was launched in 2011 to carry out docking and orbit experiments as part of China’s ambitious space programme, which aims to place a permanent station in orbit by 2023.\nIt was originally planned to be decommissioned in 2013 but its mission was repeatedly extended.
