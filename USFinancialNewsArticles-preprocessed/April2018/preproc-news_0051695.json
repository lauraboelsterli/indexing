We continue to see many growth opportunities ahead and are focused on building our current business momentum in the coming year.\"\nAssets Under Management of $754.1 Billion\nAssets Under Management were $754.1 billion at March 31, 2018 compared with $767.2 billion at December 31, 2017, resulting from $10.7 billion in liquidity outflows, negative market performance and other of $3.1 billion (despite positive foreign exchange of $2.9B) and realizations of $0.5 billion.

Legg Mason's assets under management are $754.1 billion as of March 31, 2018. To learn more, visit our web site , our newsroom , or follow us on LinkedIn , Twitter , or Facebook .\nThis release contains subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially. For a discussion of these risks and uncertainties, see \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Legg Mason's Annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 and in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nSupplemental Data Regarding Quarterly Performance\nStrategy Performance\nFor purposes of investment performance comparisons, strategies are an aggregation of discretionary portfolios (separate accounts, investment funds, and other products) into a single group that represents a particular investment objective. In the case of separate accounts, the investment performance of the account is based upon the performance of the strategy to which the account has been assigned. Each of our asset managers has its own specific guidelines for including portfolios in their strategies. For those managers which manage both separate accounts and investment funds in the same strategy, the performance comparison for all of the assets is based upon the performance of the separate account.\nApproximately eighty-seven percent of total AUM is included in strategy AUM as of March 31, 2018, although not all strategies have three-, five-, and ten-year histories. Total strategy AUM includes liquidity assets. Certain assets are not included in reported performance comparisons. These include: accounts that are not managed in accordance with the guidelines outlined above; accounts in strategies not marketed to potential clients; accounts that have not yet been assigned to a strategy; and certain smaller products at some of our affiliates.\nPast performance is not indicative of future results. For AUM included in institutional and retail separate accounts and investment funds managed in the same strategy as separate accounts, performance comparisons are based on gross-of-fee performance. For investment funds which are not managed in a separate account format, performance comparisons are based on net-of-fee performance. Funds-of-hedge funds generally do not have specified benchmarks. For purposes of this comparison, performance of those products is net of fees, and is compared to the relevant HFRX index. These performance comparisons do not reflect the actual performance of any specific separate account or investment fund; individual separate account and investment fund performance may differ. The information in this presentation is provided solely for use regarding this presentation, and is not directed toward existing or potential clients of Legg Mason.\nLong-term US Fund Assets Beating Lipper Category Average\nLong-term US fund assets include open-end, closed-end, and variable annuity funds. These performance comparisons do not reflect the actual performance of any specific fund; individual fund performance may differ. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.

Realizations are specific to our alternative managers and do not include client-driven distributions (e.g. client requested redemptions, liquidations or asset transfers). Realizations of $0.2 billion, $0.4 billion, $0.4 billion, and $0.3 billion were included in net client cash flows for the quarters ended March 31, 2017, December 31, 2016, September 30, 2016, and June 30, 2016, respectively.\n(2) For the quarter ended June 30, 2017, Other includes a reclass, effective April 1, 2017, of $16.0 billion of certain assets which were previously included in Assets Under Advisement to Assets Under Management, specifically retail separately managed account programs that operate and have fee rates comparable to programs managed on a fully discretionary basis. These Assets Under Advisement as of the quarters ended March 31, 2017, December 31, 2016, and September 30, 2016 were $16.0 billion, $13.7 billion, and $12.8 billion, respectively. The quarter ended September 30, 2017 includes a reclassification of $1.0 billion from long-term net client cash flows to Market performance and other related to this AUM. For the quarter ended June 30, 2017, Other also includes a $3.7 billion reconciliation to previously reported amounts.\n(3) Due to effects of rounding, the sum of the quarterly results may differ immaterially from the year-to-date results.\nUse of Supplemental Non-GAAP Financial Information\nAs supplemental information, we are providing a performance measure for \"Operating Margin, as Adjusted\" and a liquidity measure for \"Adjusted EBITDA\", each of which are based on methodologies other than generally accepted accounting principles (\"non-GAAP\"). Our management uses these measures as benchmarks in evaluating and comparing our period-to-period operating performance and liquidity.\nOperating Margin, as Adjusted\nWe calculate \"Operating Margin, as Adjusted,\" by dividing (i) Operating Income, adjusted to exclude the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on investments made to fund deferred compensation plans, the impact on compensation expense of gains or losses on seed capital investments by our affiliates under revenue sharing agreements, amortization related to intangible assets, income (loss) of consolidated investment vehicles, the impact of fair value adjustments of contingent consideration liabilities, if any, and impairment charges by (ii) our operating revenues, adjusted to add back net investment advisory fees eliminated upon consolidation of investment vehicles, less distribution and servicing expenses which we use as an approximate measure of revenues that are passed through to third parties, and less performance fees that are passed through as compensation expenses or net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, which we refer to as \"Operating Revenues, as Adjusted\". The deferred compensation items are removed from Operating Income in the calculation because they are offset by an equal amount in Non-operating income (expense), and thus have no impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. We adjust for the impact of amortization of management contract assets and the impact of fair value adjustments of contingent consideration liabilities, if any, which arise from acquisitions to reflect the fact that these items distort comparison of our operating results with results of other asset management firms that have not engaged in significant acquisitions. Impairment charges and income (loss) of consolidated investment vehicles are removed from Operating Income in the calculation because these items are not reflective of our core asset management operations. We use Operating Revenues, as Adjusted in the calculation to show the operating margin without distribution and servicing expenses, which we use to approximate our distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, although distribution and servicing expenses may include commissions paid in connection with the launching of closed-end funds for which there is no corresponding revenue in the period. We also use Operating Revenues, as Adjusted in the calculation to show the operating margin without performance fees, which are passed through as compensation expense or net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests per the terms of certain more recent acquisitions. Operating Revenues as adjusted also include our advisory revenues we receive from consolidated investment vehicles that are eliminated in consolidation under GAAP.\nWe believe that Operating Margin, as Adjusted, is a useful measure of our performance because it provides a measure of our core business activities. It excludes items that have no impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. and indicates what our operating margin would have been without the distribution revenues that are passed through to third parties as a direct cost of selling our products, performance fees that are passed through as compensation expense or net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests per the terms of certain more recent acquisitions, amortization related to intangible assets, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, if any, impairment charges, and the impact of the consolidation of certain investment vehicles described above. The consolidation of these investment vehicles does not have an impact on Net Income Attributable to Legg Mason, Inc. This measure is provided in addition to our operating margin calculated under GAAP, but is not a substitute for calculations of margins under GAAP and may not be comparable to non-GAAP performance measures, including measures of adjusted margins of other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as cash provided by (used in) operating activities plus (minus) interest expense, net of accretion and amortization of debt discounts and premiums, current income tax expense (benefit), the net change in assets and liabilities, net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests, net gains (losses) and earnings on investments, net gains (losses) on consolidated investment vehicles, and other. The net change in assets and liabilities adjustment aligns with the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Adjusted EBITDA is not reduced by equity-based compensation expense, including management equity plan non-cash issuance-related charges. Most management equity plan units may be put to or called by Legg Mason for cash payment, although their terms do not require this to occur.\nWe believe that this measure is useful to investors and us as it provides additional information with regard to our ability to meet working capital requirements, service our debt, and return capital to our shareholders. This measure is provided in addition to Cash provided by operating activities and may not be comparable to non-GAAP performance measures or liquidity measures of other companies, including their measures of EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA. Further, this measure is not to be confused with Net Income, Cash provided by operating activities, or other measures of earnings or cash flows under GAAP, and are provided as a supplement to, and not in replacement of, GAAP measures.\nWe have previously disclosed Adjusted EBITDA that conformed to calculations required by our debt covenants, which adjusted for certain items that required cash settlement that are not part of the current definition.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/legg-mason-reports-results-for-fourth-fiscal-quarter-and-fiscal-year-ended-2018-300636661.html\nSOURCE Legg Mason, Inc.",
