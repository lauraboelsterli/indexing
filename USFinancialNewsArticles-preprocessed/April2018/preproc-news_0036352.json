REUTERS/Denis Balibouse \n“Experience has shown, if you want a defense project to be successful it needs someone to be responsible, a leader,” German weekly WirtschaftsWoche quoted Eric Trappier as saying in an interview. \nFrance and Germany are expected to announce details of a planned new warplane at the ILA Berlin Air Show, which starts on April 25. \nThe project involves Dassault, MBDA, Thales ( TCFP.PA ) and Safran ( SAF.PA ) on the French side and Airbus ( AIR.PA ) on the German side. \n“We can take the lead role,” Dassault’s Trappier told WirtschaftsWoche. \n“The fact is: We are the only company in Europe that can built a complete fighter jet from A to Z and are the only ones who have 70 years of experience and skills,” he said. \nHe said he did not expect resistance from Airbus if it was given a junior role in the project, according to the magazine.
