    "text": "40 COMMENTS The fantasy that Tesla will one day dominate the global automotive industry is fading.\nThe struggling electric-car marker announced it made 2,020 Model 3 sedans in the final week of the first quarter and plans to match that output next week. Tesla produced nearly 10,000 Model 3s in the first quarter, a fourfold increase from the previous quarter.\nMore \nTesla Misses Model 3 Production Goal but Shows Progress Tesla Shares Sink as Musk Jokes About Bankruptcy (April 2) Options Traders Brace For More Turmoil in Tesla (April 2) NTSB ‘Unhappy’ With Tesla Over Crash Disclosures (April 1) Yet even that final, frantic week’s production fell short of Tesla’s own guidance —a familiar pattern. That didn’t stop the company from congratulating itself in its press release. “This is the fastest growth of any automotive company in the modern era. If this rate of growth continues, it will exceed even that of Ford and the Model T.”\nPerhaps Tesla is right in terms of recent percentage growth, but the Tin Lizzie made up 40% of U.S. car sales at its peak or, proportionally speaking, 65,000 times the Model 3’s best week so far.\nThe stock rose modestly Tuesday morning, which makes some sense; Tesla’s shares have sold off sharply in recent weeks on production fears and some investors had feared worse production figures. That won’t justify a rally for long, however. The details in Tesla’s report deserve careful scrutiny.\nFor starters, Model 3 production averaged about 800 a week in the quarter, a far cry from mass market volumes. While Tesla exited the quarter with a much higher rate, the company hasn’t issued total production guidance for the second quarter, though it said it would produce 5,000 cars a week in about three months. That calls the sustainability of the recent production burst into question, especially since Tesla reportedly shifted workers off its other assembly lines to focus on the Model 3 late in the quarter.\nPerhaps as a result, Tesla’s legacy product lines appeared to slow. Deliveries of the luxury Model S and Model X vehicles, which carry higher profit margins and can help keep the company’s rickety finances afloat, fell by 12% from a year ago. Though Tesla said net orders for those cars hit an record in the first quarter, a 12% decline in actual deliveries doesn’t exactly recall the glory days of Henry Ford.\nTesla also said an equity or debt raise isn’t required this year beyond using its existing lines of credit. Weaning itself off constant tapping of the capital markets would indeed be a fantastic development for the company, but math says otherwise. Moody’s Investors Service said Tesla will likely require a capital raise exceeding $2 billion in the “near term” just last week.\nAnyone tempted to bet on better times ahead would be wise to consider a recent statement from Elon Musk that wasn’t in Tuesday’s press release.\n“Car biz is hell,” he said in a message posted on Twitter Monday afternoon.\nWrite to Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.com",
