    "text": "The Boston Red Sox won their fourth straight game in Florida on Monday, beating Miami 7-3 at Marlins Park.\nChristian Vazquez went 2-for-4 with a double and two RBIs for Boston. Xander Bogaerts had two hits.\nHanley Ramirez had two hits and clubbed a two-run homer, Mookie Betts had two hits and a solo homer and Rafael Devers had two hits and an RBI.\nLeft-hander Brian Johnson (1-0) scattered six hits and allowed one run in six innings.\nBrian Anderson hit a solo home run for the Marlins, and Starlin Castro had three hits and an RBI.\nCameron Maybin (one RBI) and Lewis Brinson each had a pair of singles.\nTrevor Richards (0-1) worked 4 1/3 innings, allowing eight hits and five runs while fanning five in his major league debut.\nThe Red Sox won three of four games in Tampa Bay, claiming each of the last three in one-run wins.\nIncluding spring training and the season’s start, Boston has been in the Sunshine State for over 50 consecutive days.\nThe Marlins’ pitching staff was taxed during a four-game home series with the Chicago Cubs as they earned a split with the defending National League Central champs, including a 2-1 win in 17 innings.\nMiami opened the scoring in the second when Anderson stroked his first career homer on 2-0 fastball off Johnson, making his seventh career start for Boston.\nBogaerts singled with two outs and the bases empty in the top of the fourth, and Eduardo Nunez drove him in with a double off the third base bag to make it 1-1.\nAfter Jackie Bradley Jr.’s walk, Vazquez doubled off the third baseman Anderson’s glove and into left field, scoring Nunez and Bradley for a 3-1 lead.\nRamirez hit a hanging curve from Richards for a two-run homer to left — his first of the season — and a 5-1 lead in the fifth.\nBetts made it 6-1 by hitting his first homer to left in the seventh.\nMaybin singled in a run in the eighth.\nDevers doubled in a run in the ninth, and Castro had an RBI groundout — his 500th of his career.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
