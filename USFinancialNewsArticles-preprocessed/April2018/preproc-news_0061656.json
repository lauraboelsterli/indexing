    "text": "18 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—The Justice Department, making its final case against AT&T Inc.’s T -1.03% planned acquisition of Time Warner Inc., TWX 0.21% on Monday urged a judge to consider “alternative” remedies if he chooses not to block the merger outright.\nJustice Department lawyer Craig Conrath, in 75 minutes of closing arguments, sought to hit all of the government’s main antitrust claims against the deal and told U.S. District Judge Richard Leon that he should block the transaction because it would lead to hundreds of millions of dollars in higher prices for consumers.\nBut Mr. Conrath also laid out a fallback position for the government: If the judge decides not to block the whole deal, he should consider forcing AT&T to make a “partial divestiture,” the lawyer said, meaning the company couldn't hold on to all of Time Warner’s assets.\nMr. Conrath said Judge Leon could consider allowing AT&T to buy parts of Time Warner, but not the Turner networks, which are a focal point in the government’s case. He also floated the possibility that the judge could require other types of “structural” changes to soften the deal’s impact on consumers.\nRelated\nDOJ’s Antitrust Case Against AT&T Merger Has Been a Slog (April 29) Coverage: AT&T-Time Warner Trial (April 24) Sharp Tongue and Pencil: Meet the Judge Presiding Over the Government’s Case Against AT&T (April 9) DOJ and AT&T Clash Over Impact on Consumers of a Time Warner Deal (March 22) How the DOJ’s Face-Off With AT&T Could Alter American Business (March 15) Those are the same suggestions the Justice Department offered AT&T during conversations before the government filed its lawsuit last November. AT&T, which disputes that its Time Warner acquisition will harm consumers, rejected the idea of making such changes to the deal because it didn’t believe they were needed.\nThe department, until Monday, had not made such explicit fallback arguments to Judge Leon.\nMr. Conrath during his presentation said the “critical fact” of the trial was that AT&T could use Time Warner’s Turner networks, like TNT and CNN, as leverage to force rival pay-TV providers to pay higher prices. That would make those rivals weaker competitors to AT&T’s DirecTV, he said.\nWatch more in the series “A Brief History” Judge Leon, who spoke little during the presentation, interrupted the lawyer on this key point and asked what government evidence supported it.\nMr. Conrath cited an array of industry witnesses who had appeared at trial, such as executives from Charter Communications Inc. and Dish Network Corp. and expressed concerns about AT&T using Turner as leverage.\nThe Justice Department’s comments came after six weeks of up-and-down court proceedings that have led some observers to believe that AT&T and Time Warner have made strides at trial . But Mr. Conrath indicated from the lectern that Judge Leon had asked both sides to address the issue of merger remedies in their post-trial court papers, in the event the judge finds that the transaction raises competition concerns. Judge Leon hasn’t made such an order on the public court docket.\nMr. Conrath said AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson’s notes before a board presentation asked how Time Warner could “advantage” the company’s distribution. The CEO testified earlier this month that his jotted-down bullet point was a reminder of what the deal couldn’t do, not what it could do.\nMr. Conrath said Monday that explanation “really kind of strains credibility.”\nMr. Conrath also accused the company of “cherry picking the lowest number” in its rebuttal to the economic model developed by the government’s economist, University of California, Berkeley professor Carl Shapiro. He said the model still backs up the government witnesses’ concerns about AT&T using media holdings to protect its core satellite business.\n“AT&T is deeply invested in the status quo,” the government lawyer said.\nClosing arguments will continue Monday afternoon when AT&T and Time Warner get a chance to make a final defense of their deal.\nWrite to Brent Kendall at brent.kendall@wsj.com",
