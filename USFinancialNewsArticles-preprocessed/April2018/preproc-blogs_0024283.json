    "text": "BlackRock Chairman and CEO Larry Fink told CNBC on Thursday investors should never try to time the market and always be invested.\n\"We spend too much time talking about market timing,\" said Fink, co-founder of the world's largest money manager. \"The key for investors is to stay in the market. ... You should be 100 percent in equities.\"\nFink said he's not sure what \"inning we're in\" regarding the economic cycle. But he said the tax cut from President Donald Trump and Republicans has extended cycle.\nThe stock market reached record heights on Jan. 26 before tanking into correction territory and ushering in a period of wild swings.\nSince the Feb. 9 intraday low, the S&P 500 has gained 4.3 percent. However, the index was still nearly 1.2 percent lower for 2018 as of Wednesday's close.\n\"Volatility did change the whole dimension of the markets,\" said Fink, who appeared on \"Squawk Box\" shortly after BlackRock reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that beat estimates .\nAssets under management increased slightly from the fourth quarter to just over $6.3 trillion as of the end of March. While a huge number, it was short of expectations.\nSign Up for Our Newsletter Morning Squawk CNBC's before the bell news roundup SIGN UP NOW Get this delivered to your inbox, and more info about about our products and service.
