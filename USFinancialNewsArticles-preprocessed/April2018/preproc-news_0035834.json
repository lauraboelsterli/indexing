The U.S.-China tariff standoff has heightened volatility in financial markets over the past month.\nThe yen showed little response to the U.S.-Japan summit, at which Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed to intensify trade consultations between the two longtime allies.\nThe euro inched up 0.05 percent to $1.2381 after eking out small gains the previous day.\nTurkey’s lira stood tall after rallying more than 2 percent against the dollar overnight after the country’s president Tayip Erdogan called snap elections for June 24.\nThe lira was supported as Erdogan’s call for early elections was seen as the government’s recognition for the need for tighter monetary policy to combat inflation.\nThe lira last stood at 4.019 against the dollar.
