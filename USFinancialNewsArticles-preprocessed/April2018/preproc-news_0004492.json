REUTERS/Andrew Kelly \nTroops may be heading to the border as early as Wednesday night, Nielsen said, saying that the National Guard would support U.S. Custom and Border Protection but would not be involved in enforcement. \nNielsen spoke at a White House news briefing a day after Trump sharpened his anti-immigration rhetoric by saying he wanted to deploy U.S. military forces until his promised border wall is built. \n  said.   Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen speaks during a press briefing on border security   4, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque \nShe said the administration had drafted legislation and would be asking Congress to provide the legal authority and resources to address “this crisis at our borders.” \nShe did not give the number of the troops to be deployed or the cost of the operation. FILE PHOTO - U.S. President Donald Trump speaks while participating in a tour of U.S.-Mexico border wall prototypes near the Otay Mesa Port of Entry in San Diego, California. U.S., March 13, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque \nNielsen said that despite steps taken by the administration, the levels of drug smuggling, illegal immigration and dangerous gang activity across the border were unacceptable. \nTrump met with Defense Secretary James Mattis, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Nielsen and other officials to discuss border issues on Tuesday. \n“Until we can have a wall and proper security we’re going to be guarding our border with the military,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday, lamenting what he called “horrible” U.S. laws that left the southern border poorly protected. \nOn Wednesday, Trump said in a tweet: “Our Border Laws are very weak while those of Mexico & Canada are very strong. Congress must change these Obama era, and other, laws NOW!” \n(This version of the story was refiled to add dropped word “but” in paragraph two)   and Leslie Adler",
