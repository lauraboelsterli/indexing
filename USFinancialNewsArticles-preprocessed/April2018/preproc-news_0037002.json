    "text": "LONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - The Intercontinental Exchange said on Wednesday it will launch a three-month futures contract based on “Sonia”, the Bank of England’s interest rate benchmark which aims to replace Libor.\nCentral banks across the world want to substitute Libor, the London Interbank Offered Rate that banks were fined billions of dollars for trying to rig, with “risk free” rates like Sonia or sterling overnight index average.\nThe move by ICE puts it in direct competition with the London Stock Exchange Group, which will launch its own three-month Sonia futures contract on April 30.\nICE launched a one-month futures contract based on Sonia in December.
