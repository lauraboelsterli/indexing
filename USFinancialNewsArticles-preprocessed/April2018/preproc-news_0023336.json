    "text": "HOUSTON, April 10 (Reuters) - U.S. oil producer Chevron Corp said on Tuesday that compensation for former Chief Executive John Watson rose less than 1 percent last year.\nThe San Ramon, California-based company awarded Watson $24.8 million in compensation for 2017, when the company swung to an annual profit of $9.2 billion. The compensation includes a base salary as well as stock awards and other items, including use of the corporate jet.\nWatson retired in February 2018. His pay was 180 times larger than the median compensation of $137,849 for Chevronâ€™s 52,953 employees. (Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Richard Chang)\n ",
