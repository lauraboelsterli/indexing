    "text": "Jeff Bezos , the world’s richest person , got a lot richer Thursday.\nThe Amazon founder added $12 billion to his fortune as the company’s shares surged 6.3% to $1,614 in extended trading at 4:33 p.m. in New York — on top of a 4% gain during the regular session — after the retailer reported results that beat Wall Street estimates. That lifted Bezos’s net worth to to $134 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\nIt has been a turbulent week for the richest Americans in tech. On Tuesday, Alphabet (googl) spooked investors after first-quarter results sparked concern that the Google parent plans to go on a spending binge, punishing shares of Amazon (amzn) , Facebook (fb) and Netflix (nflx) . Bezos lost $4.6 billion that day, and Alphabet’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin each lost $2 billion.\nFacebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, whose fortune dropped $2.5 billion on Tuesday, got a reprieve Thursday as his wealth increased by $5.8 billion, a day after the social network posted better-than-expected results for the first quarter. He leapfrogged Spain’s Amancio Ortega to No. 5 in the global wealth ranking.\n",
