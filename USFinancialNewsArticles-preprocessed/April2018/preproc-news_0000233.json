    "text": "(Reuters) - Tesla Inc ( TSLA.O ) will fall short of its 2,500 per week target for production of the crucial Model 3 sedan when it reports its numbers this week, according to a report by tech website Jalopnik, citing an email from Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk to employees.\nA Tesla Model 3 sedan, its first car aimed at the mass market, is displayed during its launch in Hawthorne, California, U.S. March 31, 2016. REUTERS/Joe White - Musk told employees in a company-wide email on Monday that Tesla had just passed a rate of 2,000 per week, the report said. That was still a big increase from earlier production numbers and Tesla shares recovered some of Mondayâ€™s heavy losses in reaction to the report.\nThe company did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nReporting by Sonam Rai and Patrick Graham; Editing by Bernard Orr\n ",
