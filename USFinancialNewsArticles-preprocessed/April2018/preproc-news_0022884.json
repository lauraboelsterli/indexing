    "text": "CHONGQING, China (Reuters) - On one of the many mountains in southwest China’s sprawling region of Chongqing, a dozen wells in an exhausted gas field are this week starting to take in fresh fuel piped in from Central Asia’s Turkmenistan, thousands of miles away.\nA gas injection site of Xiangguosi underground gas storage run by PetroChina is seen in Chongqing, China March 18, 2018. REUTERS/Chen Aizhu For the next six months, state energy giant PetroChina, operator of the Xiangguosi storage facility, will also inject gas from Myanmar to fill the vast chambers 3,000 meters (9,900 ft) under the mountaintop.\nChina is aiming to turn hundreds of tapped and some still producing wells into storage facilities after a severe winter supply crunch left it short of the clean-burning fuel.\nBeijing is trying to switch more of its energy use to gas from coal to help clear up the foul air in the country’s north.\nThe drive to fill up the country’s 25 underground gas storage sites before winter arrives will also bolster imports of liquefied natural gas in the world’s No.3 gas user. Consultancy Wood Mackenzie expects imports to touch 48-49 million tonnes this year, up a quarter from last year’s record level.\nChina’s underground gas storages (UGS) can barely cover 5 percent of its total consumption, lagging behind the international average of 10-12 percent and leaving it vulnerable to supply shocks or extreme weather conditions.\nWhile the state planning agency has stressed the urgency of adding underground facilities, China’s regulated gas pricing and near-monopoly in key distribution infrastructure remain hurdles to clear for the business to flourish.\nLed by PetroChina, China has embarked on a building boom over the next 5-8 years, spending over $10 billion to nearly double gas stores.\n(GRAPHIC: China's soaring gas imports - reut.rs/2HeGFsu )\nMAN-MADE GAS FIELD\nA security guard stands at the entrance of Xiangguosi underground gas storage run by PetroChina in Chongqing, China March 18, 2018. REUTERS/Chen Aizhu Building a UGS is almost like developing a new gasfield - costly, time-consuming and requiring management skills to ensure safe operations.\nChina built its first UGS in 1999, the Dazhangtuo site near Beijing, and has since added 24 storage facilities with a total volume of 11 billion cubic meters (bcm).\nAlmost all the current sites are built from tapped or producing gas wells, the easiest and most cost-effective solution, said Ding Guosheng, of PetroChina’s UGS Institute, which is responsible for designing and planning the facilities.\nIt takes nearly two years of well testing and data analysis to identify wells suitable for storages and another three to five years to design and build.\n“You need to make sure that dried wells don’t have leaks, detect where and how much water, oil or gas still wanders under there,” said Ding.\n“We make sure the rocks are strong enough to sustain larger pressure when it’s turned into a storage.”\nTo build a storage, new wells are drilled to inject and extract gas, and pipelines and compressors added to gather and pump the fuel into the network.\nCHALLENGES AHEAD Policy-setters are soliciting industry feedback to create a business model to boost investment from outside the dominant state majors, including exploring the feasibility of trading gas storage at a new exchange in Chongqing.\nEmployees look at screens at a command centre in Xiangguosi gas storage depot run by PetroChina, in Chongqing, China March 18, 2018. REUTERS/Chen Aizhu “Without government policy support and market-driven pricing no company would want to invest....as it’s expensive to build and costly to operate,” said Han Jingkuan, president of PetroChina’s Planning and Engineering Institute.\nChina regulates gas prices by setting the wholesale city-gate rates and allows fuel producers to charge 20 percent more in peak winter sales. Beijing has for decades been subsidizing residential users.\n“In the absence of a commercial model...it remains a job for the national oil companies,” said Luo Jing, vice president of gas development of privately-run China Gas Holdings.\nBut third-party investment is being sought. Ma Xinhua, PetroChina’s top official for UGS business, said in March the state firm was in advanced talks with Chongqing government to co-invest in several storages in the gas-rich southwest.\n(GRAPHIC: China's gas output - reut.rs/2HfbxJx )\nFOREIGN EXPERTISE With gas deposits buried at wells deeper than 3,000 meters and many located in the densely populated and mountainous southwest, China faces technical and safety challenges.\nIn the United States, the world’s top gas consumer, abundant and shallow salt domes are often used for storage.\nIn its relatively short 20-year UGS history, PetroChina has tapped limited foreign expertise, having only hired U.S. gas company Enron for designing the first facility in the late 1990s and recently France’s Storengy for technical appraisals.\nBut as China considers less familiar geological features such as aquifers and salt caverns, operational and management skills may come in handy from experienced players like Russian gas giant Gazprom and French storage expert Geostock.\nGazprom, which operates storage sites seven times the size of China’s, entered into a pre-feasibility study with PetroChina in January to build a facility at Shengping in northeast China. The storage, also a tapped gas field, is planned to service “Power of Siberia”, the mega pipeline due to send gas from Siberia to China from around 2020.\n“(China faces) huge challenges as technical complexity will increase,” said Marc Fauveau, of business development with Storengy.\nReporting by Chen Aizhu.
