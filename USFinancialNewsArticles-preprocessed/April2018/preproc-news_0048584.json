(TSX:TFII) (OTCQX:TFIFF), a North American leader in the transportation and logistics industry, today announced its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“Earnings increased substantially at all four of our reportable segments, most sharply in Truckload,” said Alain Bédard, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We also enhanced transparency with the creation of a Logistics and Last Mile operating segment, which is now our second largest segment by revenue. This is a fast-growing market that we are well positioned to serve, and we believe our new segmentation better clarifies our ongoing progress.”\nFinancial highlights Quarters ended March 31 (in millions of dollars, except per share data) 2018 2017 Total revenue 1,196.5 1,204.1 Revenue before fuel surcharge 1,061.6 1,091.5 Adjusted EBITDA 1 129.0 109.5 Operating income 65.9 42.1 Net cash from operating activities from continuing operations 57.8 50.3 Adjusted net income 1 50.8 32.9 Adjusted EPS - diluted 1 ($) 0.56 0.35 Net income 48.2 14.1 EPS – diluted ($) 0.53 0.15 Weighted average number of shares ('000s) 88,950 91,609 1 This is a non-IFRS measure. For a reconciliation, please refer to the “Non-IFRS Financial Measures” section below. FIRST QUARTER RESULTS\nTotal revenue of $1.20 billion was flat compared to the prior year period. Net of fuel surcharge, revenue of $1.06 billion compares to $1.09 billion in the prior year period. The slight decrease reflects a negative currency impact of $22.0 million, as well as the company’s focus on profitable revenue and shedding business that does not meet our return requirements.\nOperating income grew 56% to $65.9 million from $42.1 million the prior year period, driven by strong execution across the organization, as well as higher quality of freight and better network efficiency in our U.S. Truckload operations.\nNet income was $48.2 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, versus $14.1 million, or $0.15 per diluted share the prior year period. Adjusted net income, which excludes amortization of intangible assets related to business acquisitions, net change in the fair value of derivatives, net foreign exchange gain or loss, gain or loss on sale of property and impairment of intangible assets, net of tax, was $50.8 million compared to $32.9 million the prior year period.\nSEGMENTED RESULTS (in millions of dollars) Quarters ended March 31 2018 2017 $\n$ Revenue 1 Package and Courier 142.4 145.6 Less-Than-Truckload 203.6 224.6 Truckload 490.7 489.7 Logistics and Last Mile 236.6 245.6 Eliminations (11.6 ) (14.0 ) Total 1,061.6 1,091.5 $\n% of Rev. 1\n$ % of Rev. 1 Operating income (loss) Package and Courier 20.6 14.5 % 15.7 10.8 % Less-Than-Truckload 9.5 4.7 % 9.1 4.0 % Truckload 29.0 5.9 % 14.8 3.0 % Logistics and Last Mile 15.0 6.3 % 12.3 5.0 % Corporate (8.3 ) (9.7 ) Total 65.9 6.2 % 42.1 3.9 % Note: due to rounding, totals may differ slightly from the sum. 1 Revenue before fuel surcharge.

The company returned $54.3 million to shareholders, of which $18.7 million was through dividends and $35.6 million was through share repurchases. TFI International’s long-term-debt-to-equity ratio stood at 1.05 as of March 31, 2018, down slightly from 1.06 at the end of 2017.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nTFI International will host a conference call on Wednesday, April 25, 2018 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time to discuss these results.

These statements are based on assumptions and uncertainties as well as on management's best possible evaluation of future events. Such factors may include, without excluding other considerations, fluctuations in quarterly results, evolution in customer demand for TFI International's products and services, the impact of price pressures exerted by competitors, and general market trends or economic changes. As a result, readers are advised that actual results may differ from expected results.\nNON-IFRS FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThis press release includes references to certain non-IFRS financial measures as described below. These non-IFRS measures do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Accordingly, they should not be considered in isolation, in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. The terms and definitions of the non-IFRS measures used in this press release and a reconciliation of each non-IFRS measure to the most directly comparable IFRS measure are provided below.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is calculated as net income or loss before finance income and costs, income tax expense (recovery), depreciation, amortization, gain or loss on sale of land and buildings and assets held for sale and impairment of intangible assets. Management believes adjusted EBITDA to be a useful supplemental measure. Adjusted EBITDA is provided to assist in determining the ability of the Company to generate cash from its operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA Quarters ended March 31 (unaudited, in millions of dollars) 2018 2017 Net income 48.2 14.1 Net finance costs 13.9 15.4 Income tax expense (recovery) 13.3 (0.5 ) Depreciation of property and equipment 47.4 52.3 Amortization of intangible assets 15.8 15.1 Gain on sale of land and buildings and assets held for sale (9.5 ) (0.0 ) Impairment of intangible assets - 13.2 Adjusted EBITDA 129.0 109.5 Note: due to rounding, totals may differ slightly from the sum. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, basic or diluted\nAdjusted net income is calculated as net income or loss excluding amortization of intangible assets related to business acquisitions, net change in the fair value of derivatives, net foreign exchange gain or loss, gain or loss on sale of land and buildings and assets held for sale and impairment of intangible assets, net of tax. Adjusted earnings per share, basic or diluted, is calculated as adjusted net income divided by the weighted average number of common shares, basic or diluted. The Company uses adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share to measure its performance from one period to the next, without the variation caused by the impacts of the items described above. The Company excludes these items because they affect the comparability of its financial results and could potentially distort the analysis of trends in its business performance. Excluding these items does not imply they are necessarily non-recurring.\nAdjusted net income Quarters ended March 31 (unaudited, in millions of dollars, except per share data) 2018 2017 Net income 48.2 14.1 Amortization of intangible assets related to business acquisitions, net of tax 11.2 9.3 Net change in fair value of derivatives, net of tax (0.1 ) (0.4 ) Net foreign exchange (gain) loss, net of tax (0.2 ) 1.1 (Gain) loss on sale of land and buildings and assets held for sale, net of tax (8.2 ) 0.1 Impairment of intangible assets, net of tax - 8.7 Adjusted net income 50.8 32.9 Adjusted earnings per share - basic 0.57 0.36 Adjusted earnings per share - diluted 0.56 0.35 Note: due to rounding, totals may differ slightly from the sum.
