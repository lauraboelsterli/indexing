    "text": "TORONTO, April 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nBradmer Pharmaceuticals Inc. (TSX VENTURE:BMR.H) (“Bradmer” or the “Company”) today announced its fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results.\nFinancial Results\nAmounts in US dollars, unless specified otherwise, and results prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”).\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a net loss of $74,000 or $0.004 per common share based on the weighted average outstanding shares of 19,659,726 during the three-month period, compared to a net loss of $21,000 or $0.001 per common share for the quarter ended December 31, 2016 based on the same shares outstanding.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $75,000 in the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $31,000 in the same quarter of the prior year. Major expenses in 2017 consisted of consulting fees of $14,000, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance premiums of $2,000, audit fees of $2,000 and legal fees of $54,000. In 2016 major expenses consisted of consulting fees of $13,000, directors’ and officers’ liability insurance premiums of $2,000, audit fees of $2,000 and legal fees of $8,000.\nThe $1,000 foreign exchange gain in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with a $10,000 foreign exchange gain in the same quarter of 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a net loss of $184,000 or $0.009 per common share based on the weighted average outstanding shares of 19,659,726 during the period, compared to a net loss of 136,000 or $0.007 per common share for the year ended December 31, 2016 based on the weighted average outstanding shares of 19,659,726.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $160,000 in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $123,000 in the prior year. Major expenses in 2017 consisted of consulting fees of $55,000, legal fees of $72,000, insurance premiums of $10,000, audit fees of $10,000 and transfer agent and stock exchange listing fees of $8,000. Major expenses in 2016 consisted of consulting fees of $54,000, legal fees of $32,000, insurance premiums of $10,000, audit fees of $10,000 and transfer agent and stock exchange listing fees of $12,000.\nThe $24,000 foreign exchange loss in 2017 compared with a $12,000 foreign exchange loss in 2016.\nThe main reason for the increased net loss in 2017 is due to the $40,000 increase in legal fees.\nBradmer’s operational activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 were financed by cash on hand. At December 31, 2017, the Company had working capital of $218,000, compared to $382,000 at December 31, 2016. Bradmer had available cash of $319,000 (CDN $400,000) as at December 31, 2017, compared to cash of $414,000 (CDN $556,000) as at December 31, 2016. The $95,000 decrease in cash was due to the $184,000 net loss partially offset by the $69,000 decrease in non-cash working capital and the $20,000 of foreign currency adjustments.\nAs at April 3, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company had 19,659,726 common shares and options to purchase 1,950,000 common shares outstanding.\nBradmer Pharmaceuticals Inc.\nPaul Van Damme\nChief Financial Officer\npvandamme@wdcapital.ca\n1.416.847.6905\nAdditional information about Bradmer, including the MD&A and financial results may be found on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nNEITHER THE TSX VENTURE EXCHANGE NOR ITS REGULATION PROVIDER (AS THAT TERM IS DEFINED IN THE POLICIES OF THE TSX VENTURE EXCHANGE) ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ADEQUACY OR ACCURACY OF THIS RELEASE.\nBradmer's common shares have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\") or any state regulatory agency in the United States.
