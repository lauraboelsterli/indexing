    "text": "* Russia committed to cuts until end of year - sources\n* Brent, WTI this week hit highest levels since November, 2014\n* 2018 demand looks strong -Goldman Sachs (Adds Trump quotes, updates prices)\nLONDON,   Oil prices fell on Friday after   criticized OPEC and said oil prices were artificially high, but they were still set for a weekly gain.\nBrent crude oil futures were at $73.26 per barrel at 1139 GMT, down 52 cents from their last close.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 48 cents at $67.81 a barrel.\n  again,\" Trump wrote in a post on Twitter.\n\"With   sea,  \nThe United States cannot legally influence oil other than through releasing oil from its strategic reserves which it has done occasionally, most recently last year in the wake of Tropical Storm Harvey.\nBoth contracts had been trading in positive territory before Trump's tweet.\nBrent and WTI hit their highest levels since November 2014 on Thursday earlier this week, at $74.75 and $69.56 per barrel respectively, buoyed by a tightening market and higher demand.\nSaudi oil minister Khalid al-Falih said OPEC and its allies were still far away from reaching their target and that a drawdown in oil inventories needed to continue.\nOPEC and its allies have been curbing production since 2017, helping push up prices. The deal to cut is currently scheduled to expire at the end of 2018.\nA technical OPEC and non-OPEC committee meeting in Jeddah on Thursday, ahead of Friday's ministerial meeting, found that a global overhang in oil inventories, which the deal has targeted for eliminating, has virtually disappeared.\n\"Even if OPEC were to reach its target of reducing oil inventories to their recent five-year average by the next official June meeting, Saudi Arabia is driving a strong agenda to maintain cuts for the balance of 2018,\" BNP Paribas global head of commodity market strategy Harry Tchilinguirian told the Reuters Global Oil Forum.\nFirm demand was also giving prices a floor.\n\"Global oil demand data so far in 2018 has come in line with our optimistic expectations, with Q1 2018 likely to post the strongest year-on-year growth since Q4 2010 at 2.55 million barrels per day,\" U.S. bank Goldman Sachs said in a note published late on Thursday.\nBeyond OPEC's supply management, crude prices have also been supported by an expectation that the United States will re-introduce sanctions on OPEC-member Iran.\n\"The first key geopolitical issue is the expiration of the current U.S. waiver of key sanctions against Iran,\" said Standard Chartered Bank in a note this week.
