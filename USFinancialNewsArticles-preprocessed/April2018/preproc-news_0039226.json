    "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Porter Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: PBIB) (“the Company”), parent company of Limestone Bank (“the Bank”), today reported unaudited results of 2018. The Company reported net income available to common shareholders of 2018 of $1.9 million, or $0.31 per basic and diluted common share, compared to net income available to common shareholders of $1.6 million, or $0.27 per basic and diluted share, of 2017.\n“We are pleased with the favorable financial results of 2018 which were largely driven by quality loan production, net interest income growth, and expense management,” said John T. Taylor, President and CEO. “We are also pleased with the $14.95 million private placement of common stock completed on March 30, 2018, which will provide capital to support the growth of our banking franchise.”\nRebranding – Effective February, 20, 2018, the Bank changed its name to Limestone Bank. We believe the new name reflects the Bank’s Kentucky heritage, which can be traced back more than 110 years. Changing the name of Porter Bancorp, Inc. to Limestone Bancorp, Inc. is on the agenda for the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders.\nNet Interest Income – Net interest income before provision expense increased to $8.2 million of 2018, compared with $8.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and $7.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. Average loans increased to $724.2 million of 2018, compared with $695.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $649.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net interest margin increased to 3.63% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with 3.50% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 3.55% in the first quarter of 2017.\nOur yield on earning assets improved to 4.45% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 4.24% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 4.23% in the first quarter of 2017. The cost of interest bearing liabilities was 0.96% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 0.88% for the fourth quarter of 2017, and 0.78% in the first quarter of 2017.\nProvision and Allowance for Loan Losses – There was no provision for loan losses in the first quarter of 2017 or 2018 due to ongoing improvements in asset quality and management’s assessment of risk in the loan portfolio.\nThe allowance for loan losses to total loans was 1.17% at March 31, 2018, compared to 1.15% at December 31, 2017, and 1.35% at March 31, 2017. The reduced level of the allowance from a year over year comparison is primarily driven by declining historical charge-off levels and improving trends in credit quality. Net loan recoveries were $324,000 of 2018, compared to net recoveries of $25,000 for the fourth quarter of 2017, and net charge-offs of $1,000 of 2017.\nNon-performing Assets – Non-performing assets, which include loans past due 90 days and still accruing, loans on nonaccrual, and other real estate owned (“OREO”), decreased to $8.8 million, or 0.88% of total assets at March 31, 2018, compared with $9.9 million, or 1.02% of total assets at December 31, 2017, and $14.7 million, or 1.56% of total assets at March 31, 2017.\nNon-performing loans decreased to $4.4 million, or 0.60% of total loans at March 31, 2018, compared with $5.5 million, or 0.77% of total loans at December 31, 2017, and decreased from $8.1 million, or 1.22% of total loans at March 31, 2017. The decrease from the previous quarter was primarily driven by $995,000 in principal payments received on nonaccrual loans. OREO remained unchanged at March 31, 2018, at $4.4 million, compared to December 31, 2017, and decreased compared to $6.6 million at March 31, 2017. The Company acquired $110,000 in OREO and sold $70,000 in OREO during the first quarter of 2018. Fair value write-downs arising from lower marketing prices or new appraisals totaled $60,000 in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and no write-downs in the first quarter of 2017.\nIn addition to nonaccrual loans and OREO, loans classified as Troubled Debt Restructures (TDRs) and on accrual totaled $922,000 at March 31, 2018, compared to $1.2 million at December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017.\nNon-interest Income and Expense – Non-interest income of 2018 increased $59,000 to $1.3 million, compared with $1.2 million of 2017. The increase from the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to an increase in bank card interchange fees of $64,000 as well as an increase in service charges on deposit accounts of $67,000. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in other non-interest income of $69,000.\nNon-interest expense decreased $84,000, or 1.20% to $7.2 million of 2018, compared with $7.3 million of 2017.\nCapital – The Company completed a private placement of common stock on March 30, 2018. In the transaction, the Company issued 150,000 common shares and 1.0 million non-voting common shares to Patriot Financial Partners III, L.P. at $13.00 per share resulting in total proceeds of $14.950 million of which $5.0 million was contributed as capital to the Bank. The balance of the proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and to support the growth of the Bank.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Bank’s Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.31%, compared with 8.70% at December 31, 2017, and its Total risk-based capital ratio was 12.43% at March 31, 2018, compared with 11.61% at December 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, the Bank’s Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 11.18%, compared with 10.35% at December 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, the Company’s Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.18%, compared with 7.11% at December 31, 2017, and its Total risk-based capital ratio was 12.56%, compared with 10.55% at December 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, the Company’s Common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 8.98%, compared with 6.92% at December 31, 2017.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities – The Company has a net deferred tax asset of $31.0 million at March 31, 2018. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are shown below:\nMarch 31, December 31, 2018 2017 (in thousands) Deferred tax assets: Net operating loss carry-forward $ 25,362 $ 25,645 Allowance for loan losses 1,790 1,723 Other real estate owned write-down 2,445 2,432 Other 2,269 2,388 31,866 32,188 Deferred tax liabilities: FHLB stock dividends 557 557 Other 312 318 869 875 Net deferred tax asset $ 30,997 $ 31,313\nAbout Porter Bancorp, Inc.\nPorter Bancorp, Inc.

from GAAP-based amounts. We calculate tangible book value per common share by excluding the balance of intangible assets from common stockholders’ equity. We calculate tangible book value per common share by dividing tangible common equity by common shares outstanding, as compared to book value per common share, which we calculate by dividing common stockholders’ equity by common shares outstanding. We believe this is consistent with bank regulatory agency treatment, which excludes tangible assets from the calculation of risk-based capital.\nThe efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure of expense control relative to revenue from net interest income and fee income. We calculate the efficiency ratio by dividing total non-interest expenses as determined under GAAP by net interest income and total non-interest income, but excluding net gains on the sale of securities from the calculation. We believe this provides a reasonable measure of primary banking expenses relative to primary banking revenue.\nAs of 3/31/18 12/31/17 9/30/17 6/30/17 3/31/17 Tangible Book Value Per Share (in thousands, except share and per share data) Common stockholder’s equity $ 85,459 $ 69,902 $ 37,297 $ 35,622 $ 32,734 Less: Intangible assets — — — — 42 Tangible common equity 85,459 69,902 37,297 35,622 32,692 Shares Outstanding 7,409,864 6,259,864 6,259,864 6,259,864 6,247,520 Tangible book value per common share $ 11.53 $ 11.17 $ 5.96 $ 5.69 $ 5.23 Book value per common share 11.53 11.17 5.96 5.69 5.24 Three Months Ended 3/31/18 12/31/17 3/31/17\nEfficiency Ratio (in thousands) Net interest income $ 8,181 $ 8,001 $ 7,741 Non-interest income 1,251 1,642 1,192 Less: Net gain on securities — 293 — Revenue used for efficiency ratio 9,432 9,350 8,933 Non-interest expense 7,169 9,072 7,253 Efficiency ratio 76.01 % 97.03 % 81.19 %\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180418006310/en/\nPorter Bancorp, Inc.\nJohn T.
