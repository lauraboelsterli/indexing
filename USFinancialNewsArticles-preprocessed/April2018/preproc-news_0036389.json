REUTERS/Daniel Munoz/File Photo \nFinancial advice came under scrutiny at the start of a fortnight of hearings by the Royal Commission into corporate wrongdoing and abuse of power by Australia’s financial sector, which could lead to greater regulation and criminal charges. \nRowena Orr, barrister assisting the independent inquiry, said more than three hundred thousand people had been compensated and the lenders had acknowledged cases of fraud, poor advice and charging for products that were not delivered. \n“The financial advice industry has been the subject of considerable scrutiny in recent years. There is good reason for this scrutiny,” she said.

In coming months, it will turn its attention to large insurers and pension funds. \nOrr said the inquiry had been inundated with submissions from members of the public complaining about poor advice or being charged for financial advice, including instances when no adviser was assigned to their accounts. \n“Many submissions refer to financial advisers providing advice encouraging Australians to engage in lending they are not capable of servicing over the long term,” Orr said. \nThe focus on the advice industry comes after an earlier set of hearings last month revealed the banks had abused their power and routinely breached laws when issuing home loans, credit cards and other consumer loans. \nThe center-right government agreed to call the inquiry after years of scandals in Australia’s financial sector, including interest-rate rigging, accusations that some institutions withheld legitimate insurance payouts, and accusations of money-laundering. \nDemand for financial advice in Australia has increased in the last decade, driven by growth in the mandatory A$2.6 trillion savings system, the country’s high levels of household debt, and the complex tax laws that apply to aging Australians. \nANZ last year sold its financial planning unit to IOOF Holdings ( IFL.AX ), while CBA is also seeking to exit the business. \nANZ, CBA, NAB and Westpac declined to comment while AMP did not respond to requests for comment.
