Containers allow applications to broken into small pieces and placed int software shells that allow the pieces to be distributed to any sort of device, in a digitally orchestrated manner, and at lower cost.\nThe new release integrates Kubeflow, a Google project geared toward simplifying machine learning workloads on Kubernetes. Canonical’s distribution of Kubernetes also supports the use of Nvidia Corp.’s graphics processing units, or GPUs, which can speed machine learning calculations.\nOther updates include tools that help move legacy workloads into containers, and new security fixes.\nRelated: Open Source Pioneer Mark Shuttleworth Says Smart “Edge’ Devices Spawn Business Models\nWrite to steven.norton@wsj.com\nShare this: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CANONICAL LINUX MARK SHUTTLEWORTH MULTICLOUD UBUNTU Previous Most U.S. Firms 'Not Ready' for Data Privacy Rules",
