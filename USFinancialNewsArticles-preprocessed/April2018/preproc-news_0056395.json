    "text": "REDWOOD CITY, Calif., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Split , the leading feature experimentation platform, today announced Ronny Kohavi as a strategic investor in the company and John Cappelletti’s appointment as vice president of global finance and operations. Split welcomes Cappelletti and Kohavi just two months after its series-B funding of $17 million. Split helps engineering and product teams to accelerate the pace of product delivery and make data-driven decisions.\n“Following our funding in February, the company is at a crucial inflection point where maintaining an aggressive pace of development for the industry’s first out-of-the box solution for experimentation is paramount,” says Adil Aijaz, CEO & co-founder at Split Software. “As we prioritize this level of growth and rapid acceleration, both John and Ronny will play important roles driving our strategic direction, and in forming the foundation our team needs to differentiate in a competitive landscape.”\nKohavi is a Microsoft Distinguished Engineer and the General Manager for the analysis and experimentation team at Microsoft, comprising of over 90 data scientists, developers, and program managers with the mission to accelerate innovation through trustworthy analysis and experimentation. He has over 15 years’ experience in running tens of thousands of controlled experiments at Amazon and Microsoft. Kohavi’s interest in Split aligns with his belief in an “experiment with everything” culture and data-driven decisions, which yields very high return-on-investment, as detailed in a recent Harvard Business Review paper.\nCappelletti brings more than 20 years of finance and business operations experience at private and public companies in the technology industry, including Primary Data and NetApp. At Split, he will be responsible for the company’s worldwide finance and operations efforts, including human resources, IT, legal, and facilities, to meet demands for the company’s feature experimentation platform.\nThe Split Feature Experimentation Platform offers enterprises a secure way to roll out software, target specific features to customers, and measure and analyze the impact of features on key metrics. The Split Feature Experimentation Platform is the only offering that can ingest and process the full spectrum of an organization’s product metrics and tie them back to actual features within the product. With the addition of Cappelletti and the strategic direction from Kohavi, Split aims to continue its current trajectory and build out its team across the U.S. and expand globally in the near term. Both will serve as foundational necessities for the company and its success.\nAdditional Resources:\nTwilio Turns to Split as a Key Component of Their Experimentation Capability to Drive Faster Product Decision O’Reilly: Understanding Experimentation Platforms Feature Experimentation for Engineering and Product Teams Video: Split Feature Experimentation Overview CITO Research: The Definitive Guide to Understanding Experimentation Platforms\nTo sign up for Split, visit https://www.split.io/ or contact sales@split.io\nAbout Split\nSplit is the leading platform for feature experimentation, empowering businesses of all sizes to make smarter product decisions.
