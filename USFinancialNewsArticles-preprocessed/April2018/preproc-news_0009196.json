    "text": "April 6, 2018 / 3:28 PM / Updated 12 minutes ago Nobel Prize-awarding Swedish Academy stunned by mass defection Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nSTOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Three members of the Swedish Academy, the body that selects the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature, have withdrawn from its board in protest over the handling of allegations of sexual misconduct by a man married to another member. Peter Englund, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, steps out of his office to announce French writer Patrick Modiano as the winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize for Literature in Stockholm October 9, 2014. REUTERS/Anders Wiklund/TT News Agency \nAcademy members and authors Peter Englund, Klas Ostergren and Kjell Espmark all said separately they would no longer participate in its work. Since seats are for life it, is not technically possible to resign. \nThe Swedish Academy in November severed ties with a man whom it had helped financially in running a cultural club in Stockholm after allegations of sexual misconduct on his part. \nAt a time of global concern over the treatment of women spearheaded by the #MeToo movement, state prosecutors opened a preliminary investigation into the incidents, but later dropped parts of it without charges being laid. \nLawyer Bjorn Hurtig, who represents the man, told Reuters his client denied all allegations. \nThe Swedish Academy has yet to make public the results of its own internal investigation. But Englund said in a blog on Friday that a rift had grown in the body over the probe and the measures taken by the Academy’s permanent secretary in the case. Swedish novelist and screenwriter Klas Ostergren poses for a photo in Lund February 28, 2014. Ostergren has been appointed a member of the Swedish Academy and will be formally installed on December 20, 2014.

Ostergren did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment but said in a letter to newspaper Svenska Dagbladet he believed the Academy was failing to live up to its own code. \nThe manager of the Swedish Academy’s office said that only Sara Danius, the permanent secretary, could comment on the case. Danius did not immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment but an auto-reply said she was currently on leave. \nBut in comments to daily Svenska Dagbladet, she said the Academy had decided to look into whether it could be made possible for members to formally resign while also saying she was saddened be the exit of her colleagues. \n“It is very sad. But I understand their reasoning,” she was quoted as saying. Reporting by Niklas Pollard, Johan Sennero, Olof Swahnberg; Editing by Angus MacSwan",
