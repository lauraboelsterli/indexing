    "text": "Botox maker Allergan is in the \"early stages\" of talks to acquire drugmaker Shire , the company confirmed Thursday following media reports.\nThe discussions put Allergan in direct competition with Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical for the London -listed drugmaker.\nShire rebuffed Takeda on Thursday, turning down an offer worth around $61 billion. Shire said the offer of $66.15 per share in cash and stock \"significantly undervalued the company, its growth prospects and pipeline.\"\nAllergan said in a statement that it has not submitted an offer and that there is no certainty of a bid. The company is required by law to announce its intention to make an offer for Shire by May 17.\nWith additional reporting from Reuters.",
