    "text": "Published: Apr 29, 2018 4:42 p.m. ET Share\n$250 million haul continues Disney’s hot streak Marvel Marvel’s “Avengers: Infinity Wars” stars, well, everyone.\nBy Erich Schwartzel\nLOS ANGELES — Walt Disney Co.’s superhero epic “Avengers: Infinity War” set new records for the biggest domestic and global opening of all time this weekend, collecting an estimated $250 million in the U.S. and Canada and totaling $630 million around the world.\nThe movie has yet to open in China, the world’s No. 2 market. With this latest release, Disney DIS, -0.61% now has nine of the 10 biggest box-office domestic openings of all time. “Avengers” barely passed the domestic record held by “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” which made its debut to $248 million in 2015, and trounced the $541 million global record set by last year’s “The Fate of the Furious.”\nThe studio is on an unprecedented box-office streak. It crossed the $1 billion mark at the domestic box office in 117 days this year — another industry record.\nWith a budget of about $300 million, “Avengers: Infinity War” is the first half of a two-part culmination for Disney’s Marvel Studios, which has been building out a “cinematic universe” of interconnected characters and story lines over 19 movies thus far. “Infinity War” combines those elements, tossing characters like Doctor Strange, Black Panther and Spider-Man into the same movie as the good guys team up against a civilization-crushing villain called Thanos. A follow-up to “Infinity War” is scheduled for release in May 2019. ",
