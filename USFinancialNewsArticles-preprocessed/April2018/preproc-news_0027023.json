    "text": "HANOVER (Reuters) - German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday backed Western air strikes on Syria as justified given a suspected poison gas attack, but called for fresh efforts to reenergise a U.N.-led peace process to end the Syrian civil war.\nFILE PHOTO: German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen addresses Germany's lower house of parliament Bundestag in Berlin, Germany, March 15, 2018. REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke “Everything must now be done to revive the political process of the Geneva talks and to end the suffering of the Syrian people,” von der Leyen, a conservative, told reporters in the northern German city of Hanover.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel this week ruled out Germany’s participation in any military action against Syria, but said it supported Western efforts to show the use of chemical weapons is unacceptable.\nReporting by Andrea Shalal; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
