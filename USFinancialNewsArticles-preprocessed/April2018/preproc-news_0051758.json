    "text": "BEAVERTON, Ore., April 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Digimarc Corporation (NASDAQ: DMRC), inventor of the Intuitive Computing Platform™ featuring Digimarc Barcode, reported financial results for the first quarter 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRevenue for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $5.6 million compared to $6.1 million in the same quarter a year-ago. The decrease was primarily due to lower license revenue reflecting the impact of amending an existing license agreement in the third quarter of 2017 whereby the company waived all future royalty obligations in one of the licensed fields of use in exchange for an upfront $3.5 million license fee.\nOperating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $11.8 million compared to $10.2 million in the same quarter a year-ago. The increase was primarily due to higher investment in sales, marketing, and engineering as the company continues to address important opportunities in market development and delivery of Digimarc Discover and Digimarc Barcode.\nOperating loss for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $8.4 million compared to an operating loss of $6.4 million in the same quarter a year-ago. The higher operating loss was primarily due to higher operating expenses.\nNet loss for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $8.1 million or $(0.72) per diluted share, compared to net loss of $6.2 million or $(0.61) per diluted share in the same quarter a year-ago.\nAt quarter-end, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $63.7 million, compared to $67.7 million at December 31, 2017.\nConference Call\nDigimarc will hold a conference call later today (Wednesday, April 25, 2018) to discuss these results, as well as provide an update on market conditions and execution of strategy. Chairman and CEO Bruce Davis and CFO Charles Beck will host the call starting at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time (2:00 p.m. Pacific time). A question and answer session will follow management's presentation.\nThe conference call will be broadcast live and available for replay via the investor section of the company's website here .\nFor those who wish to listen to the call via telephone, please dial the number below at least five minutes prior to the scheduled start time:\nToll-Free Number: 866-562-9934\nInternational Number: 706-679-0638\nConference ID: 96755399\nIf you have any difficulty connecting with the conference call, please contact Liolios Group at 949-574-3860.\nAbout Digimarc\nDigimarc Corporation (NASDAQ: DMRC) is a pioneer in the automatic identification of everyday objects such as product packaging and virtually any media, including print, images, and audio.
