He helped me understand the game better, just watching him and what he does on the football pitch,” Guardiola told a news conference on Friday.\nIt was Iniesta who scored the crucial late equaliser against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in 2009 to send Barcelona into the Champions League final. The Spaniard then shrugged off an injury to help the Catalans outclass Manchester United in Rome to win the trophy.\nHe was also crucial to Barca beating United again in the 2011 final.

I don’t see him as a Barcelona player but a football man,” Zidane said.\n“He is charming, very reserved and I like people like that. I don’t know him well but I only have good words for him and I wish him all the best as a player and as a person.”\nSpain coach Julen Lopetegui said Iniesta was still one of the best players around and added he is rare in receiving universal adoration. TOP OF HIS GAME\n“He is a player who first of all is still at the top of his game. He has been a regular starter for us in every game and I don’t speak about him in the past but in the present,” Lopetegui told reporters.\n“The manner in which he has won everything and his behaviour after winning has meant that he is given standing ovations in stadiums across Spain and abroad. That is something which very few other footballers in history have had.”\nIniesta is one of the most loved footballers in Spain after he scored the only goal in the 2010 World Cup final when they beat the Netherlands to lift the trophy for the first time.\nHe also played a key role in Spain winning the 2008 European Championship to snap a 44-year trophy drought and he was named player of the tournament when they defended the title in 2012.
