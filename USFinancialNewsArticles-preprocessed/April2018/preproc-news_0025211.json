Volkswagen CEO Dr. Herbert Diess watches a video during the Nvidia keynote address at CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. January 7, 2018. REUTERS/Rick Wilking \nThe newly-created volume brand group will also include VW’s commercial-vehicle division, one of the sources said. \n“Diess will get immense power,” he said. \nVolkswagen’s board member for procurement Francisco Javier Garcia Sanz will leave his post, the sources further said. \nPorsche Chief Executive Oliver Blume will join the management board of VW Group, one of the sources said. \nAutomobilWoche was first to report that Sanz would leave.
