    "text": "LONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - Sky Chief Executive Jeremy Darroch said he had no interest in running WPP, the world’s biggest ad group which is searching for a new chief executive after the abrupt departure of Martin Sorrell on Saturday.\n“I have no interest in running WPP, thank you very much,” he said on Thursday after the pay-TV group reported its third-quarter results.\n“Good luck to them in their change. I wish them well, but I am very happy just focusing on Sky.”\nSky, one of Britain’s biggest advertisers, reappointed WPP’s MediaCom as its media buying and planning agency earlier this month.
