    "text": "PANAMA CITY, April 10 (Reuters) - Panama will ban several Venezuelan airlines from working in the country for at least 90 days, the government said on Tuesday, the latest twist in a dispute that began when Venezuelan officials were put on a “high risk” money laundering list.\nLast week, Venezuela halted commercial relations with Panamanian officials and companies, including airline Copa , for alleged involvement in money laundering, prompting both countries to recall their ambassadors.\nPanama’s government said in a statement on Tuesday that several airlines including Aeropostal Alas de Venezuela and Santa Barbara Airlines would be suspended for 90 days from April 25.
