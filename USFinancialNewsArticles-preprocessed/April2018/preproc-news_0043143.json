    "text": "CAIRO (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron called Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Saturday to discuss the Syrian crisis, Sisi’s office said.\nFILE PHOTO - French President Emmanuel Macron waits for the arrival of Senegalese President Macky Sall at the Elysee Palace in Paris, France, April 20, 2018. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier Macron addressed the military strike that France, the United States and Britain launched in Syria a week ago, pointing out that it comes within the framework of international legitimacy, it said in a statement.\nThe three countries launched 105 missiles in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack in Syria, targeting what the Pentagon said were three chemical weapons facilities.\nSisi expressed his concern over military escalation in Syria, which he said would lead to further deterioration and add to the complexity of the situation.\nFILE PHOTO - Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi s pictured ahead of the 29th Arab Summit in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia April 15, 2018. REUTERS/Hamad I Mohammed He also “emphasized Egypt’s unyielding position that rejects the use of any internationally prohibited weapons on Syrian territories,” the statement said.\nHe stressed “the importance of conducting a transparent international investigation on the issue”.\nThe three Western countries said their strikes were limited to Syria’s chemical weapons capabilities and not aimed at toppling President Bashar al-Assad or intervening in the civil war.\nMacron had instructed French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian to visit Egypt by the end of this month to discuss ways to strengthen bilateral relations, the statement added.\nReporting by Omar Fahmy; writing by Amina Ismail; editing by Andrew Roche\n ",
