    "text": "Getty Images Shoppers exit and enter a Saks Fifth Avenue store on Fifth Avenue in New York City. Hudson's Bay said on Sunday that data from card payments in some of its Saks and\nLord & Taylor stores in North America had been compromised.\nThe Canadian retail company said it had identified the issue and taken steps to contain it, adding that \"there is no indication\" so far that the issue had affected the company's\ne-commerce or other digital platforms.\nHudson Bay \"has identified the issue, and has taken steps to contain it. Once the company has more clarity around the facts, it will notify customers quickly and will offer those impacted free identity protection services, including credit and web monitoring,\" it added.\nCustomers will not be liable for fraudulent charges that may result from the issue, the company said.\nThe stores involved include Saks Fifth Avenue, Saks OFF 5TH and Lord & Taylor, the company said.\n\"The company is working rapidly with leading data security investigators to get customers the information they need, and the investigation is ongoing,\" Hudson Bay said in a statement, adding that it was \"coordinating with law enforcement authorities and the payment card companies.\"\n--CNBC contributed to this article.",
