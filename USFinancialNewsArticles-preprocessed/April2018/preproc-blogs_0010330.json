    "text": "Getty Images | Universal Television Ike Barinholtz as Morgan Tookers on \"The Mindy Project\" \nWant to make some extra cash without investing a lot at the outset? Start a side hustle. \nThink about what skills you have and how you can do it with low overhead — it's often possible to get started with less than $1,000. \nFirst, \"Ask yourself, 'What's my passion?'\" says c areer and life coach Deborah Brown-Volkman. \"People want control over their career, and so creating their own business for under $1,000 gives them the ability to test it out, to see what works and what doesn't.\" \nOnce you feel you're onto something, purchase some sort of business insurance, advise the experts, which will likely be a big chunk of your costs. Basic business insurance usually ranges from $300 to $700 a month, depending on location and coverage. \nBeyond that, to keep costs down, Adolfo LaCola, a serial entrepreneur and star of CNBC's new show \" Staten Island Hustle ,\" advises using sweat equity — it's what he and his partners do. \n\"We keep our start up costs low by actually doing the due diligence and ... all the moves, we do all the work ourselves,\" he says. \nHere are 27 ideas to get you started. 1. Tutor \nIf you have a skill, teach it. The median wage of a tutor is $17.64 per hour, according to PayScale . 2. Dog walker \nLove pets and getting some exercise? Dog walking is an easy business to start. Pet business insurance will make up the majority of your expenses, which usually cost $200 to 400 a month, according to one pet business insurance provider . Dog walkers typically make $8 to $20 an hour, with a median wage of $13.23 . 3. Professional organizer \nIf you have a knack for turning clutter into cleanliness, why not try turning that into cash? The median hourly salary for a professional organizer is $25.88 . 4. Fashion stylist \nA great place to start is by styling a few of your friends for a party, and then encouraging them to tell their friends, say career experts. Soon you could have your own fashion business and be making a median of $16.71 an hour to above $40 once as you gain experience. 5. Translator \nMultilingual entrepreneurs, this business is for you. Whether you want to take up projects people post online, approach companies or start-ups that do a lot of international business or check local job postings, there are multiple ways to start building your own translation business. Translators make a median income of $19.88 per hour. 6. Photographer \nIf you're a stay-at-home parent with a knack for photography, creating family portraits or photographing events for people in your neighborhood could be the start of a fruitful business. The trick here is that you'll probably need to have a nice camera, a tripod and equipment insurance — the total cost of which will most likely exceed $1,000. If you can get a deal on a good camera at a lower price or already have the equipment, then the start-up costs are low. Freelance photographers make a median of $25.29 per hour. 7. Errand runner \nLots of people don't have the time to run errands daily, and a local errand service business could be a great solution. Errand runners make about $12 per hour. 8. Transcriber \nFrom video shoots to audio interviews or speeches, there's a lot out there that needs to be transcribed. If you're a good typist with a few extra hours and a computer, you could start your own transcription service. The median hourly wage for transcribers is $15.15 . 9. Freelance writer \nCompanies and content websites need good content, and you want to start your own business. Consider starting your own business as a freelance writer. Freelance writers typically are paid by the post or project, so wages can vary. 10. Jewelry maker \nJewelry makers would most likely make money on sales and projects, as opposed to hourly wages. Platforms for selling homemade goods like Etsy are a benchmark of what you could expect to charge for your products. 11. Avon or Tupperware sales person \nIndependent sales representatives for companies like Avon or Tupperware don't have to worry about creating a product or inventing a business structure. If you like talking with people, this social business could be for you. Incomes differ based on the company you work for and the amount of sales you make. 12. Makeup artist \nIf you're a professional makeup artist or hairdresser at a salon, you could earn extra income by setting up your own side business. If you love makeup or hair care but aren't an expert, consider investing in a class or certificate program. Talk with professionals to find what they recommend, experts say. Makeup artists earn a median salary of $17.19 per hour, while hairdressers earn a median of $10.15 . 13. Virtual assistant \nOrganized self-starters could find good work being a virtual assistant, a person who does all the things an assistant would normally do, just via the internet and phone. Virtual assistants earn a median salary of $15.18 per hour. 14. Personal chef \nRoll up your sleeves and break out the spices. A personal culinary business where you are a chef for private parties could be a delicious venture. Personal chefs make a median of $20.82 per hour. 15. Personal shopper \nIf you love to shop or are interested in fashion retail, starting a personal shopping business could be a great fit. Personal shoppers earn a median of $11.57 an hour. 16. Graphic designer \nGraphic design has be frustrating for the non-designer. While there are free design tools out there, many do not offer customization or the insight an expert would. That's where your business could come in. Graphic designers make from around $15 to $28 per hour, which you can factor into project prices. 17. UI/UX designer \nThis one's a little more obscure to the average entrepreneur than the others. User interface (UI) design and user experience design (UX) make sure your website or app is user friendly, intuitive and visually pleasing among other things. UI designers make an average of $41.63 per hour while UX designers make an average of $34.36 per hour. 18. Social media manager \nMany small companies or other entrepreneurs can't afford to have a social media manager or marketing team. Starting a social media company where you manage part-time or full-time other people's accounts could be a profitable gig. Social media managers make a median of $14.11 per hour. 19. Consultant \n\"Every industry could have a consultant. In order to be a successful consultant, you need to have some sort of success in that particular field,\" career expert Jill Jacinto says. \nAs a consultant, you could help businesses make contacts, form deals and guide their strategic plan. This job has a median salary of $39.55 per hour. 20. PR professional \nHave experience in a particular field? Recently retired? You likely have a lot of contacts and expertise in a specific industry, which you could leverage for your own venture. PR managers work with the media, government agencies and advertisers. The median hourly rate is $49 . 21. Wedding planner \nIf you love detail and decor and don't mind the stress of dealing with last-minute changes, a wedding planning business could be a great fit. Wedding planners earn a median of $19.89 per hour. 22. Event coordinator \nWeddings aren't the only events that need planning. Birthdays, anniversaries, graduation parties are just a few of many events people need help organizing. Event coordinators make a median of $12.77 per hour. 23. Property manager \nThis job is replacing what used to be known as the butler, experts say. A property manager looks after a household and ensures all property activities run smoothly. The manager would get the mail, do the laundry, stock the fridge, work with other professionals like gardeners and cleaning assistants. It's especially helpful for people who own multiple properties and don't have time to look after them. Property managers could make anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000 per year, according to experts. 24. Caterer \nWhile a personal chef usually caters to smaller groups, caterers prepare meals for big events. If you're a great cook who can handle multiple meals cooking at once, you could start your own catering business. Personal caterers make a median of $12.05 per hour. 25. Personal trainer \nInsurance is something you'll need at the outset with this business. If you love to work out, look into certifications you could get to become a personal trainer. If you're already certified, even better! Personal trainers make a median of $18 per hour. 26. Accountant \nIf you're a certified accountant, you could start your own practice. Accountants make a median of $18.45 per hour. 27. Copy editor \nBusiness pamphlets, grant proposals and blog posts all need copy editing. Why not take your literacy and grammar skills to the market? Copy editors make an average of $22.09 per hour. \nWant more side hustle inspiration? Catch the series premiere of \" Staten Island Hustle ,\" Wednesday April 11 at 10 PM ET/PT on CNBC. ",
