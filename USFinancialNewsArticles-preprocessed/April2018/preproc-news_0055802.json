    "text": "CLEVELAND, April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nFIRST-QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS:\nREVENUE +10.2% SAME-UNIT REVENUE +5.8% EPS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS +42.2%\nCBIZ, Inc. (NYSE: CBZ) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFor the 2018 first quarter, CBIZ reported revenue of $266.1 million, an increase of $24.6 million, or 10.2%, over the $241.5 million reported in 2017. Same-unit revenue increased by $14.0 million, or 5.8%, for the quarter, compared with the same period a year ago. Newly acquired operations contributed $10.6 million, or 4.4%, to revenue growth in the quarter. CBIZ reported income from continuing operations of $35.8 million, or $0.64 per diluted share, in the 2018 first quarter, compared with income of $25.0 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the same period a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $55.9 million, compared with $48.3 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nJerry Grisko, President and Chief Executive Officer of CBIZ, said, \"We are pleased to record strong first quarter revenue growth as well as improved margins. Our results were bolstered by strong demand for our core services, a high level of optimism among our clients regarding the general business climate, new consulting and planning engagements related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and improved results from a number of our project-oriented businesses. We also continue to benefit from the acquisitions that we made in recent years, and we are pleased to have completed two additional acquisitions so far this year.\"\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company expects growth in total revenue within a range of 5% to 8%. The Company expects to report an effective tax rate of approximately 25% as a result of the Tax Reform Act, although a number of factors may impact the tax rate. The Company expects a weighted average fully diluted share count of approximately 56.0 million shares for full-year 2018. The Company expects to achieve growth in fully diluted earnings per share within a range of 13% to 17% over the $0.92 reported for 2017. Adjusted for the one-time 2017 impact of the Tax Reform Act, the Company expects to achieve growth within a range of 20% to 24% over the adjusted $0.87 reported for 2017.\nConference Call\nCBIZ will host a conference call at 11:00 a.m. (ET) today to discuss its results.

Income and expenses related to the deferred compensation plan are included in \"Operating expenses\" ($0.1 million income in 2018 and $3.0 million expense in 2017, or 0.0% and (1.2%) of revenue, respectively) and \"Corporate general and administrative expenses\" ($16 thousand income in 2018 and $0.3 million expense in 2017, or 0.0% and (0.1%) of revenue for 2018 and 2017, respectively) and are directly offset by deferred compensation gains or losses in \"Other (expense) income, net\" ($0.1 million expense in 2018 and $3.3 million income in 2017, or 0.0% and 1.3% of revenue, respectively). The deferred compensation plan has no impact on \"Income from continuing operations before income tax expense\".\n(2)\nIncluded in \"Other (expense) income, net\" for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, is expense of $1.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively, related to net changes in the fair value of contingent consideration related to CBIZ's prior acquisitions.\n(3)\nRefer to the financial highlights tables for a reconciliation of Non-GAAP financial measures to the nearest generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") financial measure, and for additional information as to the usefulness of the Non-GAAP financial measures to shareholders and investors.\nCBIZ, INC.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (UNAUDITED)\n(In thousands)\nSELECT SEGMENT DATA\nTHREE MONTHS ENDED\nMARCH 31,\n2018\n2017\nRevenue\nFinancial Services\n$\n180,603\n$\n158,633\nBenefits and Insurance Services\n77,330\n75,164\nNational Practices\n8,157\n7,662\nTotal\n$\n266,090\n$\n241,459\nGross Margin\nFinancial Services\n$\n47,570\n$\n39,244\nBenefits and Insurance Services\n16,197\n15,022\nNational Practices\n882\n655\nOperating expenses - unallocated (1):\nOther\n(3,423)\n(3,274)\nDeferred compensation\n114\n(2,954)\nTotal\n$\n61,340\n$\n48,693\n(1)\nRepresents operating expenses not directly allocated to individual businesses, including stock-based compensation, consolidation and integration charges, and certain advertising expenses. \"Operating expenses - unallocated\" also include gains or losses attributable to the assets held in the Company's deferred compensation plan, which do not impact \"Income from continuing operations before income tax expense\" as they are directly offset by the same adjustment to \"Other (expense) income, net\" in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.
