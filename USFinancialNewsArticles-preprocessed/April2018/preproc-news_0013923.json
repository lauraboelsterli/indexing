The adult dead included the driver\nThe tragedy occurred when the bus swerved off the road and fell into a gorge. The bus was transporting children, all below the age of 13, who were studying at a private school in Nurpur town, 300 km (185 miles) from Shimla, the state capital.\n“We have identified all the children and parents have been informed about the disaster,” said Ram Nath Singh, a police officer at the accident site.\nSingh said three children with head injuries were taken to a government hospital.\nIndia has the world’s deadliest roads, with almost 150,000 people killed in accidents in 2015, the latest government data shows.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his deep anguish over the tragedy. “My prayers and solidarity with those who lost their near and dear ones in the accident,” he said in a tweet.\nReporting by Rupam Jain; Editing by Janet Lawrence and David Stamp\n ",
