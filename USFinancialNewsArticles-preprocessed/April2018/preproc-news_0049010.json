    "text": "0 COMMENTS Hearst Magazines is acquiring a minority stake in Gear Patrol, a digital and print publication focused on products and enthusiast communities, to help the company branch out into more e-commerce efforts to diversify revenue.\nGear Patrol is in the emerging crop of digital media companies that specializes in e-commerce, generating revenue by referring readers to products on websites like Amazon.com and collecting a cut of the sale.\nHearst and Gear Patrol, which announced the deal on Wednesday, declined to disclose the financial terms. The deal includes a provision to increase the investment, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nFor Hearst, the investment represents an opportunity to complement its existing e-commerce business, said Troy Young, global president of Hearst Magazines Digital Media. The company’s portfolio of brands, including Runner’s World and Bicycling, already have some elements of e-commerce, and Hearst has created a unified content management system to track the products mentioned in its articles.\nE-commerce currently comprises less than 10% of Hearst Magazines’ digital revenue, according to Mr. Young. But it’s a fast-growing category, he said, with e-commerce revenue within the division increasing 120% so far in 2018 compared with the same period in 2017.\n“Gear Patrol is focused on a type of product journalism and enthusiast category that we think is important to publishing digitally successfully,” said Mr. Young.\nE-commerce has become a staple of the publishing business in recent years, particularly as print advertising plunges and digital advertising also fluctuates. Pure-play digital media companies like Vox Media , Gizmodo Media Group and BuzzFeed have all launched e-commerce teams, and traditional publishers have also gotten into the game, such as the New York Times’s purchase of Wirecutter for a reported $30 million .\nGear Patrol plans to use some of the financing to expand its headcount from 28 full-time employees to about 63 employees by the end of the year, said Ben Bowers, a co-founder at Gear Patrol. The company plans to grow its sales and marketing operations and provide more recommendations of tech, fashion, fitness and outdoor products.\nGear Patrol has multiple revenue categories, said Eric Yang, the co-founder and editor-in-chief. The company, which is profitable, makes nearly 25% of its revenue from e-commerce and affiliate linking, he said. Gear Patrol also sells advertising, and its branded content business increased more than 70% last year, Mr. Yang said in an email. Major advertisers include Cadillac, Vans and North Face.",
