It is about my future and everything else too. We will see what happens. It is good if things are resolved quickly... I don’t want to talk about my ambitions.”\nNewcastle are 10th in the standings with 41 points and Benitez is confident the club can finish higher in the table with four games remaining.\n“We know that winning one game, we can be there in the top 10. We have more chances to keep winning and we will try to keep winning. The idea in the season has been one game at a time, and it’s what we have to do now,” he said.
