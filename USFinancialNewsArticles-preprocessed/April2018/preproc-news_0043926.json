Overall, carload volumes increased 1% compared to the prior year.\nFirst quarter 2018 revenues increased in four commodity groups, led by a 17% increase in Automotive, a 10% increase in Chemicals and Petroleum and a 9% increase in Intermodal. Revenue from Industrial and Consumer was also positive with an increase of 4% compared to the first quarter of 2017. These increases were partially offset by declines in Energy and Agriculture and Minerals of 11% and 2%, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nOperating expenses in the first quarter were $420 million, 5% higher than 2017. Operating income was a first quarter record at $219 million, an increase of 4% from the first quarter 2017. KCS reported a first quarter operating ratio of 65.8%, a 0.4 point deterioration over first quarter 2017.\nReported net income in the first quarter of 2018 was $145 million, or $1.40 per diluted share, compared with $147 million, or $1.38 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, adjusted diluted earnings per share was a first quarter record of $1.30, compared to $1.17 in first quarter 2017.\n“Despite congestion across the North American rail network, KCS grew volumes in all commodity groups except Energy and Agriculture and Minerals during the first quarter 2018,” stated Kansas City Southern’s President and Chief Executive Officer Patrick J. Ottensmeyer. “Furthermore, we maintain our outlook for mid-single digit volume growth for full year 2018.”\nGAAP Reconciliations ($ in millions, except per share amounts)\nReconciliation of Diluted Earnings per Share to Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Income Before\nIncome Taxes\nIncome Tax\nExpense\nNet Income Diluted Earnings\nper Share\nAs reported $ 221.7 $ 76.8 $ 144.9 $ 1.40 Adjustments for: Foreign exchange gain (27.8 ) (8.3 ) (19.5 ) (0.19 ) Foreign exchange component of income taxes — (8.9 ) 8.9 0.09 Adjusted $ 193.9 $ 59.6 134.3 Less: Noncontrolling interest and preferred stock dividends\n(0.5 ) Adjusted net income available to common stockholders - see (a) below\n$ 133.8 $ 1.30 Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Income Before\nIncome Taxes\nIncome Tax\nExpense\nNet Income Diluted Earnings\nper Share\nAs reported $ 237.9 $ 91.0 $ 146.9 $ 1.38 Adjustments for: Foreign exchange gain (46.8 ) (14.1 ) (32.7 ) (0.31 ) Foreign exchange component of income taxes — (10.3 ) 10.3 0.10 Adjusted $ 191.1 $ 66.6 124.5 Less: Noncontrolling interest and preferred stock dividends\n(0.4 ) Adjusted net income available to common stockholders - see (a) below\n$ 124.1 $ 1.17 (a) The Company believes adjusted diluted earnings per share is meaningful as it allows investors to evaluate the Company’s performance for different periods on a more comparable basis by excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
