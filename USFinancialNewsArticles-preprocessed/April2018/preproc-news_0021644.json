(“UBID”), whereby UBID would merge with and into Incumaker and Incumaker would be the surviving corporation. Under this Alternative Public Offering, or “APO” transaction, shareholders of UBID would own 90% of the issued and outstanding shares of Incumaker of the newly combined company that will seek to change its name to “uBid Holdings Inc.” as well as its ticker symbol post-merger to better reflect the company’s new technology related business model. Under the terms of the merger agreement, UBID’s current officers and directors would become the officers and directors of the newly combined company.\nKetan Thakker, UBID’s Chief Executive Officer, a position he will retain following the merger with Incumaker, stated: “The consummation of a definitive agreement to merge represents another significant step in recapturing value for our stockholders. Our management believes that the APO will offer UBID greater visibility within the marketplace and increased access to much-needed growth capital. Over the coming weeks, our singular focus will be taking the necessary steps to close the contemplated transaction and increase shareholder value for both shareholders of UBID and Incumaker.” Darren Bankston, CEO of Incumaker, commented: “After reviewing many merger candidates over the past six months, I feel that uBid Holdings, Inc., and, in particular, Mr. Thakker and his team, represent the best option for Incumaker and its shareholders. I am extremely impressed with what I have learned about uBid Holdings, its growth plans and its very impressive and seasoned incoming board of directors. This merger represents a very exciting time for all parties involved.”\nUnder the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, Incumaker and UBID must close the merger by May 31, 2018. The closing of the transaction is subject to UBID completing one acquisition and having the financing to consummate a second acquisition of target companies and other customary conditions, including approval by the shareholders of both companies.\nAbout uBid Holdings, Inc.\nuBid Holdings, Inc.
