    "text": "FREMONT, Calif., April 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Attivo Networks®, the leader in deception solutions for cybersecurity defense, today named security industry veteran Mark Howell as the company’s new Vice President of UK and Ireland operations. A widely respected business development leader specializing in delivering new solutions in European markets, Howell will continue to build out the company’s expanding customer and partner base. Last year, Attivo Networks grew in revenue by more than 300 percent as enterprises continue to invest in deception-based threat detection solutions to battle the escalating number and scale of security breaches and cyberattacks globally.\nAs VP of UK and Ireland operations, Howell is responsible for scaling the Attivo customer development efforts around its ThreatDefend™ Deception and Response Platform by leveraging his 20+ years’ experience in developing enterprise and channel distribution partnerships throughout the region. His experience guiding customers and channel partners from product adoption to profitability will prove valuable to Attivo Networks as the company rapidly expands its presence globally.\n“We have seen a steady increase of inquiries in the UK and Ireland and are excited to add Mark Howell to the Attivo Networks leadership team to address increased demand and further support growth initiatives for the market,” said Tushar Kothari, CEO of Attivo Networks. “Mark brings valuable expertise that will undoubtedly increase our ability to meet our customers’ threat protection requirements.”\nPrior to joining Attivo Networks, Howell was the UK and Ireland Country Manager for BDNA (acquired by Flexera), where he managed the software supply chain company’s operations in the region for the past two years.\n“Perspectives are shifting among CISOs globally, and they now recognize that deception technology is an area they need to invest in as prevention alone is no longer a sufficient means of cybersecurity defense,” said Mark Howell, Vice President of UK and Ireland, Attivo Networks. “I look forward to educating both customer and channel partner organizations throughout the region on the critical role deception technology plays in protecting company assets and how the ThreatDefend™ solution provides the tools to better understand adversaries, what they are after, and most importantly, the visibility to slow and halt an attack.”\nAbout Attivo Networks\nAttivo Networks® is the leader in deception technology for real-time detection, analysis, and accelerated response to advanced, credential, insider, and ransomware cyber-attacks. The Attivo ThreatDefend™ Deception and Response Platform accurately detects advanced in-network threats and provides scalable continuous threat management for user networks, data centers, cloud, IoT, ICS-SCADA, and POS environments.
