    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., April 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ShiftPixy, Inc. (NASDAQ:PIXY), a developing, proprietary next-gen technology platform for workforce engagement and management, today announced operating results for the three months ended February 28, 2018 (“2018 Second Quarter”).\nShiftPixy Chief Executive Officer Scott Absher commented, “As we roll out our proprietary and sophisticated technology platform, we are increasingly excited about the crucial role we’ll play in the expanding Gig Economy workplace. Our growing client roster across our expanding national footprint demonstrates the appeal of the ShiftPixy Ecosystem, and the rapid progress we’re making on the technology front will only increase platform effectiveness, ultimately helping to create value for our shareholders.”\n2018 Second Quarter Highlights\nGross billings grew 58.1% to $48.6 million, compared to $30.8 million for the 2017 second quarter; gross billings increased 20.9% sequentially from $40.2 million in the prior quarter. Revenues increased 45.8% to $7.9 million, compared to $5.4 million for the second quarter of 2017. Worksite employees increased by 3,405 to 6,798 compared to 3,393 as of February 28, 2017; the number of employees at the end of the quarter also represents a sequential increase of 1,116 over the number of employees at the end of the first fiscal quarter 2018. Gross profit was $0.9 million versus $1.1 million in the prior year period, and net loss per share was 9 cents during the quarter, versus a net loss of 4 cents the prior year period.\n“I’ve been thoroughly impressed with the contagious energy at ShiftPixy since joining earlier this year, in particular the discovery of brand new applications for our Ecosystem that further expand our horizons,” stated Chief Financial Officer Patrice Launay. “During this transformational time, we will work to optimize and manage our balance sheet in support of our rapid growth.”\nFiscal 2018 Third Quarter Guidance\nThe Company currently expects gross billings for fiscal third quarter 2018 to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million, which at the midpoint would represent a sequential increase of 13% over the fiscal second quarter 2018.\nWebcast\nShiftPixy will host a webcast at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Friday, April 13, 2018, to discuss financial results for the 2018 fiscal second quarter.
