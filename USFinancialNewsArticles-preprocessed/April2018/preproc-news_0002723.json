    "text": "LOS ANGELES, April 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CURE Pharmaceutical (OTC:CURR), an innovative drug delivery and development company, today announced the acquisition of two patents that ensure CURE has a competitive advantage in the extraction and purification of Cannabis plant material, as well as subsequent processing of Cannabis extracts for drug formulation.\n“The endocannabinoid system is a powerful pathway to treat many diseases and illness, and these patents will allow us to implement accurate and optimal dosing for treatments that would target this system,” said Rob Davidson, CEO of CURE Pharmaceutical. “We have only seen a glimpse of the potential of cannabinoids, which we are unlocking with our proprietary delivery technology.”\nThe patents will be key to reproducing and commercializing the research findings from the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology, a public research university in Haifa, Israel where CURE is sponsoring research. The current research at Technion is testing fractionated molecular components from the cannabis plant against various cancer types in vitro and in preclinical models.\nThe two issued U.S. patents No. 9,044,390 and 9,186,386 cover the extraction and fractioning of bioactive cannabinoid molecules from the cannabis plant, allowing the integration of these molecules into a dosage form, such as CUREfilm™, the most advanced oral thin film on the market today.\nThe patent inventor, Gary Speier, is a registered patent attorney with Carlson Caspers and an advisor to CURE. Speier provides counsel to grow CURE’s IP portfolio on a broad range of patent-related matters such as valuations, IP due diligence, freedom-to-operate clearance reviews and opinions relating to infringement and validity, and patent procurement and patent prosecution strategies.\nAbout CURE Pharmaceutical\nCURE Pharmaceutical is a vertically integrated drug delivery and development company committed to improving drug efficacy, safety and the patient experience through its proprietary drug dosage forms and delivery systems. CURE has a full-service cGMP manufacturing facility and is a pioneering developer and manufacturer of a patented and proprietary delivery system (CUREfilm™), one of the most advanced oral thin films on the market today.
