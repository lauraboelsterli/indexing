Broad-based growth was driven by the Zynq SoC platform and the industry-leading 20nm and 16nm technology nodes. Zynq platform revenue increased more than 60% during the year with growth driven largely by applications in Advanced Driver Assist (ADAS), Industrial, Aerospace and Defense, Communications, and Consumer. Revenues from the 20nm node increased more than 50% from the previous year and the 16nm node continued its accelerated ramp with sales more than quadrupling during the same period. The Industrial, Aerospace & Defense end market set another annual sales record in fiscal year 2018 with revenues of approximately $1.2 billion, an increase of 21% compared to fiscal year 2017. The growth was driven primarily by significant strength in Aerospace & Defense and Semiconductor Test and Emulation Applications. Xilinx has established significant momentum in Data Center over the past fiscal year, both developing the foundation for and building out a vibrant ecosystem. The Company demonstrated significant developer engagement on the AWS F1 instance and has trained a total of more than 400 developers, with approximately 300 of those in the March quarter alone. Xilinx continues to invest in its SDAccel environment and middleware libraries to make it easier for software programmers to program Xilinx FPGAs in higher level languages using industry standard APIs and frameworks. As an example, Xilinx recently released a Machine Learning suite on the AWS F1 environment with support for TensorFlow. Xilinx recently announced a new breakthrough product category called Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) that extends far beyond the capabilities of an FPGA. An ACAP is a highly integrated multi-core heterogeneous compute platform that can be changed at the hardware level to adapt to the needs of a wide range of applications, including Artificial Intelligence, and workloads resulting from explosive growth of unstructured data such as database acceleration and video transcoding. During fiscal year 2018, Xilinx returned approximately $828 million to shareholders. This included $475 million through share repurchases at an average price of $68.30 per share and $353 million through dividends. Xilinx recently increased its quarterly dividend by $0.01 per share to $0.36 per share, effective in the June quarter of fiscal year 2019, marking its 13 th consecutive year of dividend increases.\nBusiness Outlook – June Quarter Fiscal Year 2019\nSales are expected to be approximately $660 - $690 million. Gross margin is expected to be 69% to 71%. Operating expenses are expected to be approximately $260 million Other income is expected to be approximately $3 million. June quarter tax rate is expected to be approximately 10% -14%\nConference Call\nA conference call will be held today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time to discuss the March quarter financial results and management's outlook for the June quarter.
