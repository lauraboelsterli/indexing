(NYSE: CLF) today reported first-quarter results for the period ended March 31, 2018.\nAs previously discussed, on January 1, 2018, Cliffs adopted the new revenue recognition standard and recognized the cumulative effect of this change as an addition to the opening balance of retained earnings of $34 million. Under ASC Topic 606, revenue will generally be recognized upon delivery for Cliffs' U.S. Iron Ore customers, which in most cases is earlier than under the previous standard. Therefore, as a result of the adoption of the standard and the annual winter closure of the Soo Locks, revenues and net income will be relatively lower than historical levels during the first quarter and relatively higher than historical levels during the remaining nine months.\nComparative period information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.\nThe Company reported consolidated revenues of $239 million, compared to the prior year's first-quarter revenues of $462 million. Cost of goods sold was $243 million compared to $365 million reported in the first quarter of 2017.\nConsolidated results included a negative earnings contribution from the Asia Pacific Iron Ore segment, where Cliffs has ceased all mining activity. Upon the completion of shipping activity, expected in the second quarter of 2018, this business will be treated as a discontinued operation and no longer included in continuing business results.\nThe Company recorded a net loss of $84 million in the first quarter, which included a $71 million loss related to Asia Pacific Iron Ore. This segment loss included $47 million, or $0.16 per share, in unusual charges related to the closure of the mine. In addition, the Company recorded $16 million, or $0.05 per share, in income tax expense primarily related to a recent IRS notice regarding sequestration of refundable AMT credits.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, Adjusted EBITDA 1 of $12 million included a $77 million contribution from U.S. Iron Ore, a 20 percent increase from the prior-year quarter. The U.S. Iron Ore contribution was partially offset by an Asia Pacific Iron Ore Adjusted EBITDA 1 loss of $40 million, which included several closure-related charges.\n(In Millions) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Adjusted EBITDA U.S. Iron Ore $ 77.1 $ 64.1 Asia Pacific Iron Ore (39.6 ) 53.8 Corporate/Other (25.9 ) (25.7 ) Total Adjusted EBITDA $ 11.6 $ 92.2 Lourenco Goncalves, Cliffs' Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “The year started very well for our pellet business, with better-than-expected performance for both tonnage shipped and price realization. The Great Lakes ice melting earlier than forecasted has helped our blast furnace clients to start a much needed replenishing of their depleted pellet inventories ahead of their own expectations. To illustrate its strength thus far, we outperformed our EBITDA from last year's first quarter in U.S. Iron Ore, despite only recording about half the sales volumes.” Mr. Goncalves added: \"We look forward to the U.S. being the singular focus of our results for this year, as Asia Pacific is expected to be treated as a discontinued operation upon its closure. As such, all results of Asia Pacific, including those recorded this quarter, should be excluded from our continuing operations by the time we report next quarter.\" Mr. Goncalves concluded: “The strength in the domestic steel market we have seen so far this year is sustainable, and should support very strong results for Cleveland-Cliffs in 2018. With our enhanced pellet supply contracts, which are based on the domestic hot rolled steel price, IODEX and Atlantic basin pellet premium, we expect to deliver significantly increased EBITDA and cash flow in 2018.”\nU.S. Iron Ore\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Volumes - In Thousands of Long Tons\nSales volume 1,611 3,118 Production volume 4,500 4,277 Sales Margin - In Millions\nRevenues from product sales and services $ 180.0 $ 286.2 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses 118.5 237.2 Sales margin $ 61.5 $ 49.0 Sales Margin - Per Long Ton\nRevenues from product sales and services* $ 105.03 $ 79.35 Cash cost of goods sold and operating expense rate 2 57.05 58.37 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 9.81 5.26 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses* 66.86 63.63 Sales margin $ 38.17 $ 15.72 *Excludes revenues and expenses related to domestic freight, which are offsetting and have no impact on sales margin. Revenues and expenses also exclude venture partner cost reimbursements, where applicable. U.S. Iron Ore pellet sales volume in the first quarter of 2018 was 1.6 million long tons. The decrease from the first-quarter 2017 volume of 3.1 million was driven by lower carryover tonnage from the prior year nomination as well as the adoption of ASC Topic 606.\nRealized revenues per ton of $105.03 increased 32 percent from the prior-year period, primarily as a result of a favorable pricing adjustment that was driven by the substantial increase in domestic hot-rolled coil steel pricing. The increase was also attributable to higher pellet premiums and a more favorable customer mix.\nCash cost of goods sold and operating expense rate 2 in U.S. Iron Ore was $57.05 per long ton, a 2 percent decrease from $58.37 per long ton in the prior year's first quarter. The decrease was driven by a combination of lower sales volumes and standard cost methodology, which caused depreciation, depletion and amortization to comprise a larger portion of overall cost of goods sold.\nAsia Pacific Iron Ore\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Volumes - In Thousands of Metric Tons\nSales volume 1,656 3,043 Production volume 1,637 2,671 Sales Margin - In Millions\nRevenues from product sales and services $ 59.0 $ 175.4 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses 124.1 128.1 Sales margin $ (65.1 ) $ 47.3 Sales Margin - Per Metric Ton\nRevenues from product sales and services* $ 31.10 $ 54.35 Cash cost of goods sold and operating expense rate 2 66.36 37.27 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 4.05 1.54 Cost of goods sold and operating expenses* 70.41 38.81 Sales margin $ (39.31 ) $ 15.54 *Excludes revenues and expenses related to freight, which are offsetting and have no impact on sales margin. First-quarter 2018 Asia Pacific Iron Ore sales volume decreased 46 percent to 1.7 million metric tons, from 3.0 million metric tons in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was driven primarily by lower production volumes, as a result of operational decisions reflecting current market and mine conditions.\nThe realized revenue rate of $31.10 per metric ton decreased by 43 percent from the prior-year quarter as a result of increasing market discounts for low-grade iron ore and lower iron ore prices.\nCash cost of goods sold and operating expense rate 2 in Asia Pacific Iron Ore was $66.36 per metric ton, which includes accounting adjustments that were required based on the planned closure of the APIO operations. This includes a $22 million, or $13 per metric ton, adjustment to record saleable work-in process and finished goods inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. It also includes inventory impairments of $15 million, or $9 per metric ton, for inventory that is not expected to be sold; a $4 million, or $3 per metric ton, supplies inventory reserve; and a $2 million, or $1 per ton, unfavorable asset retirement obligation adjustment.\nOther Income Statement Items\nCliffs' net interest expense during the first quarter was $34 million, a 22 percent decrease when compared to the first-quarter 2017 expense of $43 million, as a result of capital structure optimization initiatives executed by the Company during 2017.\nMiscellaneous-net expense of $9 million included, among other items, $5 million in charges related to the indefinite idle at Empire mine and a $3 million long-lived asset impairment charge related to the closure of the Asia Pacific Iron Ore business.\nOutlook\n2018 Outlook Summary Per Long Ton Information\nU.S. Iron Ore Revenues from product sales and services (A) $ 102 - $107 Cost of goods sold and operating expense rate $ 68 - $73 Less: Freight expense rate (B) $ 7 Depreciation, depletion & amortization rate $ 3 Cash cost of goods sold and operating expense rate 2 $ 58 - $63 Sales volume (million long tons) 20.5 Production volume (million long tons) 20.0 (A) This expectation is based on the assumption that iron ore prices, steel prices, and pellet premiums will average for the remainder of 2018 their respective year-to-date averages. (B) Freight has an offsetting amount in revenue and has no impact on sales margin. U.S. Iron Ore Outlook (Long Tons)\nBased on the assumption that iron ore prices, steel prices, and pellet premiums will average for the remainder of 2018 their respective year-to-date averages, Cliffs would realize USIO revenue rates in the range of $102 to $107 per long ton. This represents an increase from the prior calculation based on the substantial increase in hot-rolled coil steel prices, partially offset by lower iron ore prices.\nAs a result of strong market demand for pellets in the Great Lakes, Cliffs has increased its full-year sales volume expectation by 500,000 long tons to 20.5 million long tons. Its production volume expectation of 20 million tons was maintained.\nCliffs' full-year 2018 U.S. Iron Ore cash cost of goods sold and operating expense 2 expectation was maintained at $58 - $63 per long ton.\nSG&A Expenses and Other Expectations\nCliffs' full-year 2018 SG&A expense expectation of $115 million was maintained. Cliffs also notes that of the $115 million expectation, approximately $20 million is considered non-cash.\nThe Company's full-year 2018 interest expense is expected to be approximately $130 million. Full-year 2018 depreciation, depletion and amortization associated with U.S. Iron Ore and Corporate/Other is expected to be approximately $80 million.\nCapital Expenditures\nCliffs provided the following updates to its 2018 capital expenditures budget:\nthe Toledo HBI Project spend expectation was reduced by $25 million to $225 million due to further development and refined timing of the project spending plan; the sustaining capital expectation of $85 million was maintained; and the Northshore Mine upgrade spend expectation of $50 million was maintained.\nConference Call Information\nCleveland-Cliffs Inc. will host a conference call this morning, April 20, 2017, at 10 a.m. ET. The call will be broadcast live and archived on Cliffs' website: www.clevelandcliffs.com\nAbout Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.\nFounded in 1847, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. is the largest and oldest independent iron ore mining company in the United States.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATION - EBITDA AND ADJUSTED EBITDA\nIn addition to the consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company has presented adjusted EBITDA on a segment basis, and both EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures that management uses in evaluating operating performance. The presentation of these measures is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The presentation of these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. A reconciliation of these consolidated measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in the table below.\n(In Millions) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net Loss $ (84.3 ) $ (29.8 ) Less: Interest expense, net (33.5 ) (42.8 ) Income tax benefit (expense) (15.7 ) 1.8 Depreciation, depletion and amortization (23.9 ) (23.2 ) EBITDA $ (11.2 ) $ 34.4 Less: Inventory impairments $ (18.9 ) $ — Impairment of long-lived assets (2.6 ) — Severance and retention costs (1.5 ) — Impact of discontinued operations 0.5 0.5 Foreign exchange remeasurement (0.3 ) 13.6 Loss on extinguishment of debt — (71.9 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 11.6 $ 92.2 2 CLEVELAND-CLIFFS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATION EXPLANATIONS\nThe Company presents cash cost of goods sold and operating expense rate per long/metric ton, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that management uses in evaluating operating performance. Cliffs believes the presentation of non-GAAP cash cost of goods sold and operating expenses is useful to investors because it excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization, which are non-cash, and freight and venture partners' cost reimbursements, which have no impact on sales margin, thus providing a more accurate view of the cash outflows related to the sale of iron ore. The presentation of this measure is not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The presentation of this measure may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\n(In Millions) Three Months Ended March 31, Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 U.S. Iron Asia Pacific U.S. Iron Asia Pacific Ore Iron Ore Total Ore Iron Ore Total Cost of goods sold and operating expenses $ (118.5 ) $ (124.1 ) $ (242.6 ) $ (237.2 ) $ (128.1 ) $ (365.3 ) Less: Freight and reimbursements (10.8 ) (7.5 ) (18.3 ) (38.8 ) (10.0 ) (48.8 ) Depreciation, depletion & amortization (15.8 ) (6.7 ) (22.5 ) (16.4 ) (4.7 ) (21.1 ) Cash cost of goods sold and operating expenses $ (91.9 ) $ (109.9 ) $ (201.8 ) $ (182.0 ) $ (113.4 ) $ (295.4 )\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180420005095/en/\nCleveland-Cliffs Inc.\nMedia Contact:\nPatricia Persico, 216-694-5316\nDirector, Corporate Communications\nor\nInvestor Contact:\nPaul Finan, 216-694-6544\nDirector, Investor Relations\nSource: Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.",
