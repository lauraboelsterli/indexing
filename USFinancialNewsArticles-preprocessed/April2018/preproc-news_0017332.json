    "text": "LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - British new car registrations fell by around 15.6 percent compared with a year earlier in the important selling month of March, after demand for diesel cars slumped by over a third, according to preliminary industry data released on Thursday.\nMarch is generally the top-selling month of the year as it is one of only two months when new licence plates are issued.\nBut after record-high sales in 2015 and 2016, full-year demand dropped in 2017 due to uncertainty about future environmental levies on diesel cars and weaker consumer spending after June 2016â€™s Brexit vote, which pushed up prices.\nDemand was also artificially inflated in March last year, when customers brought forward purchases to beat a tax rise which came into force in April 2017.\nThe Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders will release full data at 0800 GMT.
