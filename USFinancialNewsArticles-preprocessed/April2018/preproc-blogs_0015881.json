    "text": "Once a nest egg hits the $1 million mark, most soon-to-be retirees assume they are set. Depending on where you live, that may not be enough.\nFor those on the East and West coasts, that sum will last less than two decades.\nConsidering that many families spend more than 100 percent of their income after taxes on monthly expenses alone, personal finance site GoBankingRates measured how long $1 million in savings would last in cities across the country by comparing average expenses for people age 65 and older, including groceries, housing, utilities, transportation and health care.\nDollars stretched the furthest in cities like Houston, Austin, Texas, and Memphis, Tennessee, where annual expenditures were around $40,000 a year.\nTop 5 cities where $1 million will last the longest:\n1. Houston \n$1 million will last: 25 years, 11 months\n2. Oklahoma City \n$1 million will last: 24 years, 7 months\n3. Austin, Texas \n$1 million will last: 24 years, 6 months\n4. Tulsa, Oklahoma \n$1 million will last: 24 years, 4 months\n5. Memphis, Tennessee \n$1 million will last: 24 years, 3 months\nIt's little surprise that retirees could blow through $1 million much faster in hotspots like New York, Boston and San Francisco by spending upward of $55,000 annually just getting by.\nTop 5 cities where $1 million will last the shortest:\n1. New York \n$1 million will last: 17 years, 6 months\n2. Boston \n$1 million will last: 17 years, 11 months\n3. San Francisco \n$1 million will last: 17 years, 11 months\n4. Philadelphia\n$1 million will last: 18 years, 0 months\n5. San Jose, California \n$1 million will last: 18 years, 2 months\n\nAlternatively, a separate analysis by GOBankingRates found the",
