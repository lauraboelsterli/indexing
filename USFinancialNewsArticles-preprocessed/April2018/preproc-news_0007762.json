    "text": "April 3, 2018 / 3:00 PM / Updated 17 minutes ago Mexico slaps tariffs on steel pipes from Korea, Spain, India, Ukraine Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexico economy ministry said on Tuesday it has formally imposed anti-dumping duties on imports of carbon steel pipe from South Korea, Spain, India and the Ukraine after completing an investigation into “unfair” trade practices. Wire rods are pictured at Kalisch Steel factory in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico March 27, 2018. REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez \nThe investigation came at the request of a company and covered an analysis of the period from April 2013 to March 2016, the ministry said in a statement in the government’s official gazette. \nMexico has imposed duties in recent years on steel products from several countries after local steelmakers announced cuts in thousands of jobs in 2015 and canceled investments. \nRecently, Mexico’s economy ministry imposed anti-dumping duties in March on imports of carbon steel pipe from China.
