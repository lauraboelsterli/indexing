    "text": "April 18, 2018 / 6:52 AM / Updated 7 hours ago Spurs draw was confidence booster, says Brighton's Bruno Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Brighton and Hove Albion’s confidence-boosting home draw against Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday can be a platform to push for Premier League survival, captain Bruno has said. Soccer Football - Premier League - Brighton & Hove Albion vs Tottenham Hotspur - The American Express Community Stadium, Brighton, Britain - April 17, 2018 Brighton's Bruno Saltor salutes their fans after the match Action Images via Reuters/Matthew Childs \nMidfielder Pascal Gross scored a second-half penalty to cancel out Tottenham striker Harry Kane’s opener as 13th-placed Brighton moved to 36 points, eight clear of the drop zone. \n\"It's really important, but it's not just about the point. To get a point against a side like that is vital for us in terms of confidence,\" Bruno told Brighton's website here \n“It’s really difficult to play against Tottenham with the way that they play and the movement they have ... as a team, we never give up, and that resilience is so important.” \nBrighton travel to Burnley for their next league game later this month before a testing run-in sees them face Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool in their final three fixtures. \n“What we need now is to keep performing well after a really good performance ahead of a massive game against Burnley,” Spaniard Bruno added. \n“We have quite a long week to prepare for it. We need another three points to make sure that we stay up.” Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford",
