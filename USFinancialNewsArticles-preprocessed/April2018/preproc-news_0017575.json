    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Air France said on Tuesday it had raised its pay offer to unions in a bid to end strikes that have already cost the airline 170 million euros ($210 million).\nAn Air France Boeing 777-300ER is parked on the tarmac at Orly Airport near Paris as Air France pilots, cabin and ground crews unions call for a strike over salaries, France, April 10, 2018. REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes The carrier, which is part of Air France-KLM ( AIRF.PA ), doubled the 1 percent immediate pay increase previously offered to unions and proposed talks on a deal for the 2019-21 period in response to their demands for a 6 percent wage hike.\nAir France is facing a seventh day of strikes on Wednesday in a six-week campaign that has coincided with rolling nationwide rail strikes, as SNCF workers protest against plans to reform the state-owned railway.\nReporting by Laurence Frost; editing by Michel Rose\n ",
