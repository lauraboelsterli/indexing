    "text": "SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore’s competition watchdog said Uber will delay the ride-hailing app’s shutdown in the city-state by a week to April 15.\nFILE PHOTO: A view of Uber and Grab offices in Singapore March 26, 2018. REUTERS/Edgar Su/File Photo Uber was initially set to end its services by April 8 in Singapore after a deal to sell its Southeast Asian operations to rival Grab.\nLast week, Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore (CCCS) commenced investigation into the transaction and proposed interim measures that will require Uber and Grab to maintain their pre-transaction independent pricing.\nThe regulator said on Friday that it received a set of alternative interim measures from Grab and Uber.\n“CCCS is reviewing the parties’ submissions in relation to the interim measures directions, including the proposed alternative interim measures,” it said.\nThe firms have agreed to push back the shutdown of Uber’s app to allow CCCS’s deliberation on their representations and proposed measures, the regulator added.\nReporting by Aradhana Aravindan; Editing by Himani Sarkar\n ",
