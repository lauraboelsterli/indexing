    "text": "STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish police arrested three people on Monday on suspicion of preparing to commit terrorist crimes and took in several more for questioning after raids in northern Sweden and the Stockholm area, the security police said.\nIt added there were no indications that any attack was planned for the next few days.\n“Preparations for the suspected crime have been ongoing for some time,” the security police said.\nThe terrorist threat level remained unchanged at three on a scale of five.\nSecurity police declined to give further comment.\nIn April last year Uzbek asylum seeker Rakhmat Akilov killed five people when he mowed down pedestrians with a truck on a busy Stockholm street. He is on trial and has confessed to driving the truck.\nReporting by Johan Ahlander and Helena Soderpalm; Editing by Alison Williams\n ",
