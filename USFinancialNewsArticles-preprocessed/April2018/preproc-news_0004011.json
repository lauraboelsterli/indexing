Drivers of the food delivery service Ele.me prepare to start their morning shift after an internal security check in Beijing, China, September 21, 2017. REUTERS/Thomas Peter \nThe deal implies an enterprise value of $9.5 billion for Ele.me, Alibaba said in a statement. \nEle.me, which roughly translates as “Hungry?”, is part of a fast-growing - though fiercely competitive - market in China being driven by consumers eager to make purchases on their smartphones, from groceries to cinema tickets.
