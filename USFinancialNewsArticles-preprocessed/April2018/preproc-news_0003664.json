    "text": "NEW YORK, April 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The founders of Fluent, LLC, sole operating subsidiary of cogint (NASDAQ:COGT) and an industry leader in performance-driven digital marketing services, purchased a total of 240,000 shares in open market transactions as disclosed in Form 4 filings by both Ryan Schulke, its Chief Executive Officer, and Matthew Conlin, President, with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n“Fluent’s business has continued to perform exceptionally with respect to growth and profitability,” said Ryan Schulke, CEO of Fluent. “Based on all previous valuations of our business dating back to 2015, and my own assessment of the quality and health of our assets, I believe we are trading at an extreme discount to the company’s actual value.”\nSchulke and Conlin continue to rank among the company’s top shareholders. Following today’s purchases, Schulke owns directly and indirectly a total of 8,364,537 shares of cogint common stock.\nAbout Fluent\nFluent, LLC, a cogint company (NASDAQ:COGT), is an industry leader in data-driven digital marketing services, focusing on customer acquisition and re-engagement campaigns, and serving over 500 leading consumer brands and direct marketers.
