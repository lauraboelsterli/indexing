    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - There are signs that the best of a recent upturn for air freight has passed, an industry association said, while warning of protectionist risks to the outlook for the rest of the year.\nDemand for air freight rose 6.8 percent in February, while capacity rose more slowly at 5.6 percent, positive for load factors and yields, the International Air Transport Association said on Wednesday.\n“The positive outlook for the rest of 2018, however, faces some potentially strong headwinds, including escalation of protectionist measures into a full-blown trade war,” IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac said.\nReporting by Victoria Bryan; Editing by Maria Sheahan\n ",
