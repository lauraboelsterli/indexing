    "text": "April 26, 2018 / 5:52 PM / Updated 2 hours ago 'Saturday Night Live' stars to host television's Emmy Awards Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - “Saturday Night Live” performers Colin Jost and Michael Che will host the Emmy Awards in September while Lorne Michaels, the creator of the satirical sketch show, will produce the ceremony honouring the best in television, broadcaster NBC announced on Thursday.\nJost and Che are the anchors of the “Weekend Update” segment on “Saturday Night Live” that spoofs a television news show.\nThe Emmy ceremony also will feature other cast members from “Saturday Night Live,” which is enjoying its biggest audiences in more than 20 years largely due to skits skewering key players in the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.\nEmmy nominations will be announced on July 12 and the winners will presented on Sept. 17 in Los Angeles.\nLate-night talk show host Stephen Colbert was host of the ceremony last year when “Saturday Night Live” won nine Emmys, including honours for Alec Baldwin’s withering impersonation of Trump and Melissa McCarthy’s turn as former White House spokesman Sean Spicer.\nThe 43-year-old sketch show last year saw its biggest audiences in 23 years. This year viewership is slightly down to about 9.4 million viewers, according to ratings data. Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Bill Trott",
