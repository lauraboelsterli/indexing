GLOBAL TOP NEWS • U.S. escalates China trade showdown with tariffs on $50 billion in imports The Trump administration on Tuesday raised the stakes in a growing trade showdown with China, targeting 25 percent tariffs on some 1,300 industrial technology, transport and medical products to try to force changes in Beijing's intellectual property practices. • Japan March services PMI shows slowest growth in 17 months as new orders ebb Activity in Japan's service sector expanded at the slowest pace in 17 months in March as new business growth cooled, suggesting a slight moderation in overall economic growth. • Samsung's Q1 profit seen at $13.7 billion as DRAM chip margins soar Samsung Electronics Co Ltd is set to forecast a near 50 percent jump in quarterly profit on Friday as an unprecedented rally in the global memory chip market should outweigh a slowdown in smartphones and related components sales. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) The SGX Nifty nearest-month futures were trading at 10,281.00, up 0.1 percent from its previous close. The Indian rupee is likely to edge higher against the dollar after the U.S. unveiled a list of Chinese products on which it plans to impose tariffs. Indian government bonds are likely to trade little changed because investors may stay on the sidelines as the Monetary Policy Committee’s first meeting for current financial year starts today. The yield on the benchmark 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in a 7.32 percent-7.36 percent band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • The three major U.S. stock indexes ended higher after a choppy session on Tuesday as investors looked forward to earnings season while the S&P 500 pushed above a key support level and Amazon.com shares jumped on bets that criticism from President Donald Trump would not translate to policy changes. • Asian share markets faltered as simmering fears of a Sino-U.S. trade war overshadowed a bounce on Wall Street and left investors reluctant to take positions in anything. • The dollar eased against the yen, with the outlook clouded by worries that escalating U.S.-China trade tensions could exert a toll on the global economy and U.S. growth. • U.S. Treasury yields rose on Tuesday as stock markets firmed and as investors looked ahead to Friday's closely watched employment report for March. • Oil prices slipped on expectations for a build-up in U.S. crude inventories, but Russian government comments on prospects for stepping up cooperation with OPEC to coordinate output cuts braked steeper declines. • Gold prices were steady in early Asian trade as the dollar eased amid escalating trade tensions between the United States and China.
