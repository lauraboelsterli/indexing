    "text": "PLEASANTON, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ellie Mae ® (NYSE:ELLI), the leading cloud-based platform provider for the mortgage finance industry, today reported results for the On January 1, 2018, Ellie Mae adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, using the modified retrospective method. 1 The first quarter of 2018 financial results herein are presented under ASC 606, which replaced the previous accounting standard ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and 2017 financial results are presented under ASC 605. A reconciliation of the first quarter 2018 results under ASC 606 and ASC 605, as well as a reconciliation of other non-GAAP measures discussed in this release, is presented on the table “Non-GAAP Reconciliation” in this release.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nRevenues of $117.9 million, up 27% from $93.0 million in 2017. Under ASC 605, revenues for the first quarter 2018 would have been $116.0 million, up 25% from 2017. Net income of $2.2 million, down from $9.6 million in 2017. Under ASC 605, net income for the first quarter 2018 would have been $0.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA of $23.9 million, up from $20.8 million in 2017. Under ASC 605, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter 2018 would have been $21.9 million. 553,000 loans closed on Encompass. 2\n“Ellie Mae is off to a strong start with first quarter financial results exceeding expectations and the number of closed loans on our platform increasing 7% year-over-year despite lower industry volumes,” said Jonathan Corr, President & CEO.\n“The increasing popularity of Encompass throughout the industry was evidenced by our March user conference, Ellie Mae Experience, which grew to over 3,000 attendees. At the conference, we unveiled our vision for a True Digital Mortgage that supports the entire loan lifecycle from home buyer interest, the initial consumer engagement and application, all the way through to post-closing and investor delivery. Data, business analytics and machine learning will be key drivers to the True Digital Mortgage. Building on this, our team will continue to deliver NG technology and enriched solutions throughout this year and into next as we drive toward our goal of end-to-end automation of the entire mortgage process,” concluded Mr. Corr.\n1 Ellie Mae adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method with the cumulative effect of initially applying Topic 606 as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of January 1, 2018. The comparative financial information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect in those prior periods.\n2 Closed loans consist of loans originated (which excludes correspondent purchased loans or brokered loans) on the Encompass platform, which is calculated by adding the loans reported to us as originated by our Success Based Pricing lenders and estimating the number of loans originated by the small percentage of lenders that are purely on a subscription service.\nFinancial Results\nTotal revenue for 2018 was $117.9 million, compared to $93.0 million for 2017. Net income for 2018 was $2.2 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, compared to $9.6 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for 2017.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income for 2018 was $12.0 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, compared to $8.9 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for 2018 was $23.9 million, compared to $20.8 million for 2017.\nSecond Quarter and Full Year 2018 Financial Outlook\nOur guidance is provided utilizing ASC 606. Over the course of the year, we expect ASC 606 to have a minimal impact on our revenue as compared to ASC 605. First quarter 2018 revenue under ASC 606 was approximately $2.0 million higher than under ASC 605 primarily as a result of straight-lining an amount of additional closed loan revenue we estimate we will receive from a portion of our Success Based Pricing customers during the terms of their contracts. This has the effect of increasing revenue in the first and fourth quarters, when closed loan volumes are seasonally low and decreasing revenue in the second and third quarters, when closed loan volumes are seasonally high.\nFor the second quarter of 2018, our revenue is expected to be in the range of $122.0 million to $124.0 million. Net income is expected to be in the range of $1.0 million to $2.0 million, or $0.03 to $0.06 per diluted share, which includes additional implementation costs related to the adoption of ASC 606 and the amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and integration costs related to the Velocify acquisition. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $13.6 million to $15.6 million, or $0.38 to $0.43 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $29.5 million to $31.5 million. Per share guidance assumes a weighted average share count of approximately 36 million.\nFor the full year 2018, revenue is expected to be in the range of $495.0 million to $505.0 million. Contracted revenue 3 is now expected to be in the range of $350.0 million to $355.0 million, an increase from the prior range of $335.0 million to $340.0 million provided on February 8, 2018. Net income is expected to be in the range of $10.0 million to $14.0 million, or $0.28 to $0.38 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $61.0 million to $65.0 million, or $1.68 to $1.78 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $126.7 million to $132.0 million. Per share guidance assumes a weighted average share count of approximately 36 million.\n3 Contracted revenues are those revenues that are fixed by the terms of a contract and are generally not affected by fluctuations in mortgage origination volume. These revenues consist of the base fee portion of success-based revenues, monthly per-user subscription revenues, professional services revenues, and subscription revenues paid for products other than Encompass.\nAdditional information about the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their related GAAP financial measures, is set forth below under the section entitled, “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\nQuarterly Conference Call\nEllie Mae (the “Company”) will discuss its first quarter 2018 results today, April 26, 2018, via teleconference at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. To access the call, please dial 800-289-0548 or 719-457-2664 at least five minutes prior to the 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time start time. A live webcast of the call will be available on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at http://investor.elliemae.com . An audio replay of the call will be available through May 10, 2018 by dialing 888-203-1112 or 719-457-0820 and entering access code 1050670.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nEllie Mae provides investors with the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit, and free cash flow in addition to the traditional GAAP operating performance measure of net income as part of its overall assessment of its performance. In addition, Ellie Mae provides investors with the non-GAAP financial measures under ASC 605 to compare against the Company’s GAAP financial measures under ASC 606. Adjusted net income consists of net income plus stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and the non-GAAP income tax adjustments. EBITDA consists of net income plus depreciation and amortization, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and income tax provision, less other income, net. Adjusted EBITDA consists of EBITDA plus stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted gross profit consists of gross profit plus stock-based compensation and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles that are included in cost of revenues. Free cash flow consists of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less acquisition of property and equipment and internal-use software. Ellie Mae uses adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted gross profit as measures of operating performance because they enable period to period comparisons by excluding potential differences caused by variations in the age and depreciable lives of fixed assets, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and changes in interest expense and interest income that are influenced by capital market conditions. The Company also believes it is useful to exclude stock-based compensation expense from adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted gross profit because the amount of non-cash expense associated with stock-based awards made at certain prices and points in time (a) do not necessarily reflect how the Company’s business is performing at any particular time and (b) can vary significantly between periods due to the timing of new stock-based awards. The non-GAAP income tax adjustments are calculated based on the annual non-GAAP effective tax rate, which quantifies the tax effects of the non-GAAP adjustments. These non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of the Company’s financial performance under GAAP and have limitations as analytical tools. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, net income, operating income, gross profit, operating cash flow or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company cautions that other companies in Ellie Mae’s industry may calculate adjusted net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted gross profit, and free cash flow differently than the Company does, further limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. A reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, gross profit to adjusted gross profit, and operating cash flow to free cash flow is included in the tables below.\nDisclosure Information\nEllie Mae uses the investor relations section on its website as the means of complying with its disclosure obligations under Regulation FD.
