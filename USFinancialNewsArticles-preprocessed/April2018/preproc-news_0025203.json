    "text": "MCLEAN, Va., April 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Freddie Mac (OTCQB:FMCC) today announced the addition of two new officers to its Multifamily line of business. Specifically, the company announced that Pamela Dent has been promoted to vice president, Multifamily Asset Management while Ian Ouwerkerk has been elevated to vice president, Multifamily Underwriting.\n“As our business continues to grow, we are developing new ways to meet the needs of the market—and new leaders to address these opportunities,” said David Brickman, executive vice president and head of Freddie Mac Multifamily. “The promotions of Ian Ouwerkerk and Pamela Dent help bolster our ability to meet market challenges. I congratulate these talented individuals on their new roles.”\nIan Ouwerkerk, vice president Multifamily Underwriting\nIan Ouwerkerk has worked with Freddie Mac for a decade, most recently leading the Southeast underwriting team. During that time, Mr. Ouwerkerk has exercised exceptional skill at balancing credit risk management while finding innovative solutions for our sponsors and lenders. He has been instrumental in executing several of our large complex deals over the last few years.\nIn his new role, Mr. Ouwerkerk will have oversight for the conventional underwriting teams in the Central and Southeast regions. In addition, he will take a leadership role in our large regional pool transactions across the country.\nPamela Dent, vice president, Multifamily Asset Management\nPamela Dent joined Freddie Mac in 2011, and has earned respect both internally and externally for her skill in overseeing Multifamily special servicing, including asset resolution, real estate owned properties, borrower transactions, structured transactions and securitized transactions. Ms. Dent will now lead asset management activities for Multifamily — owning and maintaining the asset management component of our servicing standard.\nFreddie Mac Multifamily is the nation’s multifamily housing finance leader. Historically, nearly 90 percent of the eligible rental homes we fund are affordable to families with low to moderate incomes. Freddie Mac’s Duty to Serve plan aims to expand affordability and address America's most persistent housing problems.\nFreddie Mac makes home possible for millions of families and individuals by providing mortgage capital to lenders. Since our creation by Congress in 1970, we’ve made housing more accessible and affordable for homebuyers and renters in communities nationwide. We are building a better housing finance system for homebuyers, renters, lenders and taxpayers.
