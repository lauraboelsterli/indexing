    "text": "SHANGHAI, April 4 (Reuters) - The United States’ trade investigation into Chinese firms has no factual basis and the environment for intellectual property protection has continuously improved, a leading Chinese trade group for machinery and electronic products said on Wednesday.\nThe China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products, which has nearly 10,000 members, made the comments in a statement issued to state broadcaster CCTV.\nIt said that the US’ actions would cause “huge” losses to Chinese and U.S. firms and noted that the Chinese government was ready to take equal measures on U.S. products to safeguard China’s interests. “We will give it full support,” it said.
