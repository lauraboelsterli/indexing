    "text": "GOP Rep. Charlie Dent says he will leave Congress earlier than expected Rep. Charlie Dent says he will leave Congress in the \"coming weeks.\" Dent already said he will not run for re-election in the midterm elections this year. It is unclear if the state will hold a special election to replace Dent before November. Tom Williams | CQ Roll Call | Getty Images Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa. \nRep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa., announced Tuesday he will leave Congress in the \"coming weeks,\" earlier than expected. \nDent, 57, announced last year he will not seek re-election in November. The reason for the timing change was not clear. \n\"After discussions with my family and careful reflection, I have decided to leave Congress in the coming weeks,\" Dent said in a statement. \"Serving the people of the 15th Congressional district has been a tremendous responsibility and the privilege of a lifetime, and I am honored by the trust that so many of my constituents placed in me to represent them in Washington.\" \nDent, a moderate Republican and occasional critic of President Donald Trump , has served in the House since 2005, representing a district between Harrisburg and Easton in east-central Pennsylvania. Under newly redrawn Pennsylvania congressional districts, Dent would have run in a revised 7th District, which has moved in Democrats' favor, according to nonpartisan election handicappers. \nDent's new district is considered a possible pickup opportunity for Democrats as they try to flip 23 seats to take a House majority. He is among multiple House Republicans from Pennsylvania who decided not to seek re-election. \nIn a statement, National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Rep. Steve Stivers of Ohio said the group will \"work tirelessly to keep this seat under Republican control.\" \nPennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf will make a decision on whether to hold a special election to replace Dent once he receives the congressman's official resignation, Wolf's office said in a statement. Under state law, a special election can occur more than 60 days after the governor issues an order about filling the vacancy. \nDent showed a tendency to sometimes break with his party on key issues. He voted against a House Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act last year. \nDent has criticized Trump's comments about immigrants and the president's remarks about violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year. He also introduced a version of a bill to protect special counsel Robert Mueller from possible attempts to remove him. Mueller is investigating Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election and whether Moscow coordinated with the Trump campaign. \nDent did vote with Republican leaders to approve the tax overhaul signed into law in December.",
