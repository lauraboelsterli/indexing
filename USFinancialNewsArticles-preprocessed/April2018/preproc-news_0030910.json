    "text": "(Reuters) - Australia’s two-time world champion Tyler Wright put a nearby shark attack to the back of her mind as she progressed to the women’s quarter-finals of the Margaret River Pro on Monday.\nTyler Wright of Australia surfs during the women's World Surf League (WSL) championship at Guincho beach in Cascais, Portugal September 29, 2016. REUTERS/Rafael Marchante The third stop of this year’s World Surf League (WSL) Championship was put on hold after the first three heats of round two due to a nearby shark attack at Gracetown in Western Australia, just 15 kilometers away from the event.\nTwo people were hurt in separate incidents, with one man airlifted to hospital for treatment.\nFollowing discussion between local authorities, safety teams and the surfers, the organizers decided to restart the competition with added ski and drone presence.\nWright, the WSL champion for the past two seasons, overcame Paige Hareb of New Zealand with a score of 14.73 in round two before advancing past France’s Johanne Defay and Coco Ho of Hawaii in round three with 14.06.\nAt the close of round three, surf conditions deteriorated causing further competition to be postponed, including cancellation of any activity on Tuesday. A reassessment will be made on Wednesday.\nReporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing ",
