    "text": "YEREVAN (Reuters) - Armenian protest leader Nikol Pashinyan said on Friday that the opposition would probably boycott any snap parliamentary election unless parliament made him the interim prime minister next week.\nArmenian opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan attends a news conference in Yerevan, Armenia April 27, 2018. REUTERS/Gleb Garanich Parliament is due to choose a new interim premier next week and Pashinyan has said he is the only legitimate choice for the job even though he is not a member of the ruling party which has a majority of seats in parliament.\nArmenian politicians have spoken of holding a snap parliamentary election once a new interim premier is in place.\nA close Russian ally, Armenia is in the middle of a political crisis after two weeks of anti-government protests that led to the resignation of Serzh Sarksyan as prime minister on Monday.\nPashinyan, at a news conference on Friday, also called for a two-day moratorium on protests in the capital Yerevan, but insisted that demonstrations take place in other cities during that time.\nReporting by Hasmik Mkrtchyan in Yerevan and Maria Kiselyova in Moscow; Writing by Gabrielle TÃ©trault-Farber; Editing by Andrew Osborn\n ",
