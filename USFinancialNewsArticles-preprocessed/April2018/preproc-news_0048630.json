    "text": "NEWARK, N.J., April 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Solbright Group, Inc. (OTCQB: SBRT), an industrial automation and energy management company providing Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) solutions that help commercial and industrial facilities increase efficiency and reduce cost, today announced financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 ended February 28, 2018.\nRevenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 was $2,496,544, an increase of over 900% compared to revenue of $263,800 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, while gross profit increased to $928,036 from $212,440 year over year, an increase of over 430%. Gross profit margin was 37% for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 84% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in revenue and gross profit as well as decrease in gross margin reflect the growth in the Energy Solutions segment of our business year over year. The Company posted a loss from operations of $609,463 in the period versus a loss from operations $107,276 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $363,088 for the nine months ended February 28, 2018, versus $497,746 for the same period in fiscal 2017.\n\"We remain very encouraged by our results this quarter, particularly as we manage through some short-term macroeconomic headwinds in the solar industry. We are pleased with the continued growth in our pipeline as well as the traction we are seeing with our technology solutions,\" said CEO Terrence DeFranco. \"Fiscal 2018 is a transitional year for Solbright as we position the service segment of our business as a source of growing revenue and an enabler for sales of our technology solutions. Increased market penetration through our Energy Solutions segment increases sales opportunities for our technology, so it is very encouraging to see this continued growth. Commercial and industrial facilities owners--particularly in retail, health care, education, specialty agriculture and data centers--can benefit from the bundling of our robust Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) platform for energy management and predictive maintenance with our solar and LED lighting installations by lowering energy consumption and maintenance costs, extending asset life, increasing efficiency and productivity and realizing their sustainability goals. Overall, we are very pleased with our results and remain optimistic about the direction of our company and our commitment to drive value for our customers and shareholders.\"\nTotal operating expenses were $1,537,499 compared to $319,716 in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily due to the increase in personnel related to the SolBright acquisition. Other income/expenses, which totaled $1,832,245, included interest expense of $1,291,919 and non-cash charges for modification of beneficial conversion features on convertible notes and amortization of debt discount and deferred finance costs, both related to the Company's long-term debt, which totaled $540,326.\nThe net loss was $2,442,183 or ($0.09) per basic and diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to a net loss of $271,550, or ($0.02) per basic and diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Basic and diluted per share results are based on weighted average shares outstanding of 26,663,305 and 13,998,191 for the third quarters of fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, respectively.\nAbout Solbright Group, Inc.:\nSolbright Group, Inc. is an industrial automation and energy management company providing Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) solutions that help commercial and industrial facilities increase efficiency and reduce cost.
