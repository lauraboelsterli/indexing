The logo of the European Central Bank (ECB) is pictured outside its headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany, April 26, 2018. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach\nBank will be asked to pay 474.8 million euros in fees this year, up from 425 million euros (374.5 million pounds) a year earlier, and the ECB plans to spend 502.5 million euros on supervision, also using cash left over from 2017, it said in a statement.\nThe ECB argued that several factors accounted for the increase, which follows a 10 percent rise a year earlier.\n“These factors include the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU (Brexit) and the costs associated with the ECB’s involvement in conducting the European Banking Authority’s biennial supervisory stress tests for significant banks in 2018,” the ECB said in a statement.
