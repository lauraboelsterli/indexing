    "text": "10:29 AM EDT \nLittle Caesars is giving away free pizza on Monday, April 2 after losing a March Madness bet. \nThe restaurant chain said it would give customers free lunch combos if a #16 seeded team defeated a #1 seeded team in the 2018 men’s college basketball tournament, which occurred when the #16 seeded University of Maryland, Baltimore County beat the #1 seeded Virginia Cavaliers 74-54 on March 16. \nNow, basketball fans and pizza lovers can have lunch on Little Caesars’ dime. The promotion includes a four-slice deep dish pepperoni pizza and a 20-ounce drink from the Pepsi family on April 2. \nTo receive the free Little Caesars pizza, customers must order the lunch box no later than 1 p.m. local time on April 2. The promotion begins at 11:30 a.m. on Monday. Because \"CRAZY HAPPENED\" with a #16 beating a #1 (!!!!), everyone in America gets a free #LittleCaesars Lunch Combo on Monday, April 2nd. \nCongratulations & see our OFFICIAL RULES for more details: https://t.co/vHuy8315ee pic.twitter.com/8KGbskGFxt \n— Little Caesars (@littlecaesars) March 17, 2018 \nEach family is eligible for one lunch combo.
