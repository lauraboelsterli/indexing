    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday that euro zone member states should add solidarity mechanisms such as a banking union to the existing instruments meant to improve competitiveness if they want the bloc to thrive.\n“No monetary union can exist without elements of convergence,” the French leader said in a joint conference with German Chancellor Angela Merkel ahead of talks on the currency union’s reform.\n“The most important thing is not to react on such and such instrument at this stage, but to be sure that we share the same goals and to have a joint political objective,” he added.\nBoth leaders want to present joint proposals in June, Macron reiterated.\nReporting by Michel Rose; Editing by Ingrid Melander\n ",
