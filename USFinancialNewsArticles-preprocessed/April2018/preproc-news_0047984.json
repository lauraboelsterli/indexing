Lyn Hayth, III, President & CEO stated, \"Bank of Botetourt is gratified to post the most profitable quarter in our Bank's 119 year history.\" The favorable earnings result is primarily attributed to an increase of $392,000 or 12.2% increase in net interest income compared to the year prior.

Total deposits at March 31, 2018 amounted to $371,835,000, compared to $341,924,000 at December 31, 2017, an increase of 8.8%. Net loans grew 2.8%, to $347,021,000 at March 31, 2018 from $337,666,000 at December 31, 2017.\nBank of Botetourt continues to exceed the BASEL III capital requirements.
