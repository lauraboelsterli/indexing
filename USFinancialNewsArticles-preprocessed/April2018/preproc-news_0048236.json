    "text": "(Adds details, background)\n U.S. prosecutors were nearing their first charges against generic-drug companies in a nearly four-year-old criminal probe into a possible price-fixing, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\nAt least two companies were on track to be charged in the coming months along with several executives, the report said, adding that charges could be filed as soon as the summer. ( bloom.bg/2Hoy6MJ )\nSoaring drug prices from both branded and generic drugmakers have sparked outrage and investigations in the past, with President Donald Trump last year calling it \"getting away with murder\". In October, Reuters reported here a lawsuit on the price-fixing case accused 18 companies, including Mylan and Teva Pharmaceutical, and named 15 medicines.\nFederal authorities had raided at least two companies during the investigation. The offices of Perrigo Company Plc were searched last year and Mylanâ€™s headquarters was raided by the FBI in the winter of 2016, the Bloomberg report said.\nMylan and Perrigo were not immediately available for comment. Teva declined to comment.\nReporting by Anirban Paul in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur\n ",
