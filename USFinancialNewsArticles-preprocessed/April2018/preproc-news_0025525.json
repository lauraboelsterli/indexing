    "text": "Matt Carpenter cracked a two-run homer in the bottom of the 11th inning Tuesday night as the St. Louis Cardinals outlasted the visiting Milwaukee Brewers 5-3 at Busch Stadium.\nPaul DeJong led off with an infield single against J.J. Hoover (0-1) before Carpenter pulled a 1-1 curveball just over the wall in right for his second homer of the season and his third career walk-off blast.\nDominic Leone (1-2) pitched a clean inning for the victory as St. Louis (5-6) twice rallied to get itself in position to win before finally ending the 4-hour, 2-minute marathon.\nEach team scored a run in the 10th on a two-out RBI single. Orlando Arcia put the Brewers ahead in their half of the inning, but Greg Garcia answered back with a looper into right that scored Yairo Munoz.\nSt. Louis forced extra innings with a little help from Milwaukee. Cardinals pinch hitter Tommy Pham drew a leadoff walk in the bottom of the ninth and advanced to second on Garcia’s sacrifice bunt. Jacob Barnes relieved Taylor Williams and threw two wild pitches in a three-pitch span to score Pham with the tying run.\nMilwaukee took the lead in its half of the ninth with a two-out rally. Eric Thames doubled into the right field corner and scored when Domingo Santana fought off a high, inside 0-2 fastball from Bud Norris and lined it into left for an RBI single.\nMilwaukee initiated scoring on the game’s fourth pitch. Thames jumped on a meaty changeup and drilled it 411 feet into the bleachers in right field for his fourth homer of the year.\nThat was all the Brewers got off Carlos Martinez, who after tossing 8 1/3 shutout innings Wednesday night in Milwaukee pitched six more solid innings Tuesday. He got a no-decision in the rematch after allowing six hits, walking two and fanning four.\nBrewers lefty Brent Suter outdueled Martinez over the first five innings, not allowing a hit until Kolten Wong led off the fifth with a bunt single. Suter finally hit a bit of a roadblock in the sixth, and St. Louis tied the game as reliever Oliver Drake issued a four-pitch walk to Munoz with the bases loaded.\nSuter permitted four hits and a run in 5 1/3 innings, walking one and striking out two.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
