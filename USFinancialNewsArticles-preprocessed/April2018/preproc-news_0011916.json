    "text": "April 6, 2018 / 9:13 AM / Updated 25 minutes ago Italy tax police search Eni offices in Congo Republic corruption probe: sources Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nMILAN (Reuters) - Italy’s tax police have searched the offices of oil major Eni as part of a probe into alleged corruption in the Republic of Congo, two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday. FILE PHOTO: Eni's logo is seen in front of its headquarters in San Donato Milanese, near Milan, Italy, April 27, 2016. REUTERS/Stefano Rellandini/File Photo \nThe sources said the searches had occurred in past days. \nEni was not immediately available for a comment. \nEni said last year it was being investigated by Milan prosecutors for international corruption relating to agreements signed by its Congo subsidiary with the Congo Republic’s Ministry of Hydrocarbons in 2013 to 2015. \n(This version of the story corrects first paragraph to show the country is Republic of Congo and not Democratic Republic of Congo) Reporting by Emilio Parodi, writing by Stephen Jewkes",
