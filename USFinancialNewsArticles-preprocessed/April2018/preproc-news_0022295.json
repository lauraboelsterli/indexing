    "text": "LONDON, April 11 (LPC) - Some €3.3bn equivalent of leveraged loans backing KKR’s buyout of Unilever’s spreads business Flora Food Group have traded down in Europe’s secondary loan market, leaving sellers nursing losses on the jumbo loan, bankers said.\nFlora’s €2bn term loan B was Quote: d at 98.8 on April 9 and a £700m term loan B was Quote: d at 98.9, lower than the final Original Issue Discount (OID) price of 99.5 when the deal closed on March 7, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.\nThe deal’s trading levels are lower than Europe’s top 40 leveraged loan composite, which had an average bid of 99.42 on April 9, the data shows.\nThe €2bn euro loan, which is the largest single-tranche euro-denominated term loan B since the financial crisis, tested investors’ limits, sources said.\nThe financing also included a US$875m dollar loan, which was Quote: d at 100.6 on April 9, and a €700m revolving credit facility as well as €1bn of senior unsecured high-yield bonds which are expected to launch shortly.\nInvestors were allocated nearly all of their commitments on the euro loans, which is rare in a market where demand from the booming institutional buyside typically exceeds supply.\nOne investor said that they put in an order of €60m on the deal, expecting to receive an allocation of around €40m, but received €57m instead.\n“Everyone is full to the brim on this deal,” a senior investor said.\nSome investors tried to sell excess exposure but struggled to find willing buyers which lead to softer loan bids, but some investors have opted to sell at a loss.\n“Technically its outside primary fees that were offered to the general market, so any investors selling would make a loss,” a loan trader said.\nThe euro and sterling term loans were Quote: d lower than the OID at 99.19 and 99.25 respectively when the loan broke for trading on March 7, before trading lower to current levels.\nThe euro loan hit a low of 98.68 on March 27, the data shows.\n“The worry on those larger deals is you need to tap so much liquidity so can’t really afford to get it wrong at all,” a leveraged banker in London said.\nFlora’s €475m-equivalent Polish zloty tranche has also fallen in the secondary market and was Quote: d at 97.33 on April 9. It allocated at 99.5 on March 7 and was Quote: d at 99 on the break, TRLPC data shows.\n“There were losses on the zloty - it hurts,” the trader said.\nKKR was not immediately available to comment.\nHITTING RESISTANCE Flora’s performance follows the downward trajectory of the broader secondary leveraged loan market which has been dragged lower by wider market volatility.\nAverage bids on Europe’s top 40 leveraged loans fell to 99.42 on April 9 from 99.85 on March 7.\nSome investors also rejected Flora’s loan due to aggressive features within the documentation, several sources said.\nInvestors are becoming less willing to accept weaker terms after aggressive documentation on recent loans such as petrol forecourt operator EG Group and French telecom network service provider Circet Groupe.\n“Documentation is near a tipping point,” a syndicate head in London said.\nSecondary bids could soften further due to the sheer volume of deals that are expected to be launched in the second quarter in Europe.\nDeals in the pipeline include Carlyle’s €10.1bn carve-out of Akzo Nobel’s specialty chemicals business and Blackstone’s US$20bn carve-out of Thomson Reuters Financial & Risk division.\nBlackstone is buying a 55% stake in Thomson Reuters’ Financial and Risk unit, which includes LPC.\nFlora Food Group raised €4.7bn-equivalent of leveraged loans backing its buyout by KKR, after attracting around 80 major investors into the jumbo cross-border deal.\nEditing by Claire Ruckin and Tessa Walsh\n ",
