    "text": "ATLANTA, April 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Interface , Inc. (Nasdaq: TILE), a worldwide modular flooring company and global leader in sustainability, today announced results for the first quarter ended April 1, 2018.\n\"We are continuing to deliver against our value creation strategy, starting off the year with solid performance in line with our expectations. We're seeing positive momentum in the business with organic sales up 6.6% over the prior year period and organic orders up 12% year over year. Our customers are responding favorably to our new LVT offerings and we will continue to expand that portfolio over the course of the year,\" said Jay Gould, CEO of Interface. \"As anticipated, our gross margin was down slightly year over year due to higher input prices as well as exiting the FLOR specialty retail stores. As planned, SG&A expenses were flat as a percent of sales over the prior year while the dollars were up as we executed on our planned investments to accelerate growth. Overall, we delivered EPS of $0.25.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Summary\nSales: First quarter GAAP net sales were $241 million, up 8.8% over the prior year period on broad-based growth and positive currency impacts, offset partially by the Company's exit from FLOR specialty retail. Organic sales growth, which adjusts for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and exiting FLOR specialty retail, was up 6.6% year over year.\nOrganic orders, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and exiting FLOR specialty retail, were up 12% year over year.\nThe Company continued to see growth in its core carpet tile as well as LVT, as both product categories continued to drive solid sales and order growth.\nOperating Income: First quarter operating income was $23 million, or 9.6% of sales, compared with $15.8 million, or 7.1% of sales, in the prior year period. Excluding last year's restructuring and asset impairment charges, adjusted operating income was $23 million, or 10.4% of sales, in the first quarter of last year.\nGross margin was 38.9% for the first quarter, a decrease of 80 basis points over the prior year period, driven by higher input costs as well as exiting of the FLOR specialty retail stores.\nFirst quarter SG&A expenses of $71 million, or 29.3% of sales, remained flat as a percentage of sales compared to $64.7 million, or 29.3% of sales, in the first quarter of 2017. The dollar investments in the first quarter and the pace of SG&A spend are in line with the Company's targeted annual SG&A plan and targeted run rate.\nNet Income and EPS: Net income during the first quarter of 2018 was $15.1 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2017 net income of $8.5 million, or $0.13 per diluted share. Adjusted prior year period net income was $13.2 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, which excludes the restructuring and asset impairment charge reported last year.\nShare Repurchases: The Company completed an additional $14.5 million of stock repurchases in the first quarter, executing on the previously announced $100 million share repurchase program.\nFiscal Year 2018 Outlook\nLooking at the full year of 2018, Interface reaffirms it is targeting to achieve 3 - 5% organic sales growth, gross profit margin of 39 - 39.5%, SG&A expenses that are relatively flat to 2017 as a percentage of net sales, an effective tax rate of 26 - 27%, interest and other expenses that are projected to be $2 million to $3 million higher than 2017, and capital expenditures of $50 million to $60 million. Based on historic seasonality, current forecasts, and prior year comparables, the Company continues to expect its strongest operating income growth in the second and third quarters of 2018, with softer growth in the first and fourth quarters.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nInterface provides adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted operating income, organic sales and organic sales growth as additional information regarding its historical operating results. These measures are not in accordance with – or alternatives to – GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, non-GAAP operating income and other non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Adjusted net income, adjusted EPS and adjusted operating income exclude the effects of restructuring and asset impairment charges. Organic sales and organic sales growth exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and Interface's exit from its FLOR specialty retail stores. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures appear in the tables following this news release. This news release should be read in conjunction with the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K furnished today to the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission, which explains why Interface believes presentation of these non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors, as well as any additional material purposes for which Interface uses these non-GAAP measures.\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\nThe Company will host a conference call tomorrow morning, April 26, at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time, to discuss its first quarter 2018 results.
