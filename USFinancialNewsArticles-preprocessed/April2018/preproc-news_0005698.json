    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Dreyfus Municipal Bond Infrastructure Fund, Inc. (NYSE: DMB) today announced a distribution of $0.0530 per share of common stock, payable on May 1, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 18, 2018. The ex-dividend date is April 17, 2018. The previous dividend announced in March was $0.0530 per share of common stock.\nThe Fund intends to make regular monthly distributions to its common shareholders at a level rate based on its projected performance. At times, to maintain a stable level of distributions, the Fund may pay out less than all of its net investment income or, in addition to paying out current net investment income, the Fund may pay out accumulated undistributed income, or may return capital. As market conditions and portfolio performance may change, the rate of distributions on the Fund's shares of common stock and the Fund's distribution policy could change.\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180403006599/en/\nFor Press Inquiries:\nThe Dreyfus Corporation\nBenjamin Tanner\n212-635-8676\nor\nFor Other Inquiries:\nMBSC Securities Corporation\nThe National Marketing Desk\n200 Park Avenue\nNew York, New York 10166\n1-800-334-6899\nSource: Dreyfus Municipal Bond Infrastructure Fund, Inc.",
