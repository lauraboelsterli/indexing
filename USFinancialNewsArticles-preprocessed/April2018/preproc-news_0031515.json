    "text": "HONG KONG, April 17 (Reuters) - The Hong Kong-listed shares of ZTE Corp were suspended on Tuesday after the United States and Britain issued warnings over the Chinese telecom equipment maker.\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce has banned American companies from selling components to ZTE for seven years after breaking an agreement reached after it was caught illegally shipping goods to Iran.\nSeparately, Britain’s main cyber security agency said it had written to organisations in the UK’s telecommunications sector warning them about using services from ZTE.\nReporting By Anne Marie Roantree; Editing by Eric Meijer\n ",
