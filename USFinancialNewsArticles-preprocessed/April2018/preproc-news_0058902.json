The benchmark declined 0.2 percent on Thursday.\nU.S. equities rallied the day before boosted by strong quarterly earnings and after the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasuries closed below 3 percent.\nIn Australia, health care stocks accounted for most of the gains and rose to a record as positive sentiment emanating from a takeover bid for Healthscope continued to spill over to the broader sector.\nBiotherapeutics company CSL Ltd rose 2.9 percent to its highest ever, lifting the benchmark, while medical device company Cochlear Ltd jumped 2.8 percent to a record high.\nMaterials also gained, with gold miner Newcrest Mining Ltd rising about 3.1 percent to a near two-month high.\nMeanwhile, the New Zealand benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index firmed 1.1 percent or 88.32 points to finish the session at 8,370.37, and gained 0.6 percent for the week.\nHealth care stocks led gains in New Zealand as well, with Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Corporation Ltd surging 3.5 percent, while Ryman Healthcare Ltd ticked up 0.9 percent.\nIndustrials underpinned the bullish trend, with Auckland International Airport Ltd adding 2.1 percent, its biggest intraday percentage rise in about 10 weeks.\nThe airport operator said earlier that its total passenger numbers rose an annual 8.5 percent in March.
