(Nasdaq:TITN), a leading network of full-service agricultural and construction equipment stores, announced today it has entered into a definitive purchase agreement to acquire all interests of two companies, AGRAM Landtechnikvertrieb GmbH and AGRAM Landtechnik Rollwitz GmbH (collectively “AGRAM”), which consist of four Case IH agriculture dealership locations in the following cities of Germany: Burkau, Altranft, Rollwitz and Gutzkow. In its most recent fiscal year, AGRAM generated revenue of approximately $30 million.
