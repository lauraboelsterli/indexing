    "text": "April 26, 2018 / 4:28 PM / Updated 6 minutes ago Carvalhal sweating over Swansea duo for Chelsea game Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Swansea City boss Carlos Carvalhal is sweating over the fitness of defenders Federico Fernandez and Kyle Bartley ahead of Saturday’s Premier League match against Chelsea. Soccer Football - Premier League - Manchester City v Swansea City - Etihad Stadium, Manchester, Britain - April 22, 2018 Swansea City manager Carlos Carvalhal REUTERS/Phil Noble\nFernandez was forced off with a knee injury during Swansea’s 5-0 defeat at Manchester City last weekend, while his replacement Bartley has picked up a minor knee problem.\n“So we have all players training other than those who are long-term,” Carvalhal told reporters on Thursday.\n“We have two situations of players who are having scans this afternoon to know if they can be involved, and they are Fede and Kyle Bartley.\n“Fede had a hard kick and he felt some pain, so because of that we must be sure there is nothing serious wrong and Kyle has a knee problem, he stretched the ligament so that needs a scan.”\nThe injuries could force Carvalhal to make changes to the starting lineup but he still expects his team to produce another spirited performance against Chelsea at the Liberty Stadium.\n“We want all the players available of course,” the Portuguese manager added.\n“But if they are not involved, we don’t have a problem – we don’t want any excuses.\n“It will be a very tough game against a very good team with players who will all go to the World Cup at the end of the season and who have a very good manager. It’s David against Goliath again.”\nSwansea, who are 17th in the table and four points clear of the relegation zone, have picked up 13 points from their last five home matches.
