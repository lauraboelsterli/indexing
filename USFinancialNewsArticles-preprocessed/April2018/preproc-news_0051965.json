    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Encouraging results and a recovery among industrials helped European stock markets on Thursday, while earnings disappointments weighed heavily on some stocks including Germany’s Lufthansa and Kion.\nA statue is pictured next to the logo of Germany's Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, Germany, September 30, 2016. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach The STOXX 600 inched up 0.2 percent by 0833 GMT, enjoying a timid bounce from the one-week lows hit in the previous session, when anxiety over rising bond yields jolted risky assets.\nAs investors sifted through the heaviest week of earnings season, JP Morgan equity strategist Mislav Matejka said: “Based on the results so far, the earnings delivery looks encouraging in the US, while the numbers in Europe and Japan are somewhat softer, but still positive.”\nBank earnings were a key focus.\nDeutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) shares recovered after a 2.6 percent fall at the open, trading up 0.2 percent by 0833 GMT after the bank said it would scale back its bond and equities trading in a major overhaul of its investment bank, after reporting a 79 percent drop in net profit in the first quarter.\n“The strategy potentially resolves the capitalization concerns of the bank, but profitability remains an issue,” said KBW analysts.\nDeutsche Bank shares are down more than 27 percent year-to-date, the worst-performing of the European banks sector .SX7P.\nMeanwhile Norway’s largest bank, DNB ( DNB.OL ), jumped 5.9 percent after profit beat expectations as a pick-up in activity in the oil sector wiped the bank clean of loan losses.\nAmong notable gainers, Finnish oil refining firm Neste ( NESTE.HE ) topped the STOXX, jumping 12 percent after reporting first-quarter sales that comfortably topped analysts’ estimates.\nIndustrials were strong overall, with French engine maker Safran ( SAF.PA ) rising after results, but Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) weighed down the sector with a 6.1 percent fall.\nThe German airline’s revenue growth disappointed due to expansion of its Eurowings budget carrier.\nInvestors are watching the European earnings season keenly for any signs of strain from slowing economic growth after recent business activity and consumer confidence measures faltered.\nAnalysts have downgraded their expectations for euro zone earnings. The euro zone STOXX .STOXXE saw the biggest downward revisions to earnings estimates since July 2016 this week.\nOil majors moved in opposite directions after results.\nFrance’s Total ( TOTF.PA ) rose a modest 0.4 percent after it reported that record production had lifted profits, while Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) declined 2.4 percent despite reporting a 42 percent rise in first-quarter profit.\n“First quarter free cash flow generation was at $4.4 billion, below our estimates on weaker than expected operating cash flow,” wrote Goldman Sachs analysts on Shell.\nFinnish mobile equipment maker Nokia ( NOKIA.HE ) tumbled 7.1 percent after profits fell short of expectations due to telecom operators holding off spending.\nGerman forklift maker Kion blamed a slowing in the market for weaker than expected first-quarter order intake. Its shares tumbled 6.4 percent.\nShares in Philips Lighting ( LIGHT.AS ), the world’s largest lighting maker, fell 11 percent after the firm reported lower than expected first-quarter earnings due to falling sales and margins.\nBE Semiconductor Industries ( BESI.AS ) sank 12 percent to the bottom of the STOXX 600 after its results. Semiconductors across Europe have been under pressure recently as sentiment on the tech sector turns more pessimistic.\nThe autos sector .SXAP was the best-performing after a report that China is considering halving duty on imported cars.\nPeugeot ( PEUP.PA ) rose 1.5 percent and Fiat Chrysler ( FCHA.MI ) was up 1 percent. Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) gained 2.8 percent to lead the DAX, boosted also by first-quarter results and optimism over its new CEO.\nReporting by Helen Reid; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg and Jon Boyle\n ",
