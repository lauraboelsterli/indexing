If they give excuses to Iran, Tel Aviv and Haifa will be destroyed,” Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s representative at the Quds force cleric Ali Shirazi was Quote: d by Fars as saying. “Iran can destroy Israel.”\nThe Quds Force is the espionage and paramilitary wing, in charge of overseas operations, of the elite Revolutionary Guards.\nFars said Shirazi made the comments in response to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Wednesday speech at Israel’s annual Holocaust commemorations when he called for action against Iran.\nThe United States has threatened air strikes against Syria over the use of chemical weapons that Syria and its allies Iran and Russia deny.\nWriting by Parisa Hafezi; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg\n ",
