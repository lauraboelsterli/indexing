    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline’s ( GSK.L ) chief executive said on Wednesday she had no interest in acquiring Shire ( SHP.L ), the London-listed rare diseases specialist that Takeda Pharmaceutical ( 4502.T ) hopes to buy for some $64 billion.\nThe GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) logo is seen on top of GSK Asia House in Singapore, March 21, 2018. Picture taken March 21, 2018. REUTERS/Loriene Perera Emma Walmsley, speaking to reporters after first-quarter results, said the British drugmaker’s focus was on deals to acquire early-stage experimental drugs that would help rebuild the company’s pharmaceuticals pipeline.\nReporting by Ben Hirschler; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
