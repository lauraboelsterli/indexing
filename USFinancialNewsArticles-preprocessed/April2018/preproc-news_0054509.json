    "text": "PARIS, April 25 (Reuters) - Airbus plans to increase production of single-aisle A320-family aircraft to 63 a month, a company spokesman said, confirming press reports.\nThe production increase, first reported by France’s La Tribune, will take effect in 2019, accelerating previous plans to lift output to 60 aircraft a month over the same period.\nThe plans were unveiled to suppliers in a letter earlier this month.\nOver the longer term, Airbus is studying plans to raise output of its best-selling jet family to as high as 75 aircraft a month, a source familiar with the company’s planning said.\nCurrently, Airbus is producing 55 a month, the source added.\nAirbus Chief Executive Tom Enders has spoken of proposals to raise production to 70 a month over an undefined period, reflecting rising air travel and strong commercial jet demand.
