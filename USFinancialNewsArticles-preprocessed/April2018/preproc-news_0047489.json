    "text": "A deluge of earnings is expected stateside this week, with around one third of S&P 500 companies, including Facebook and Boeing , slated to report first-quarter results in the days ahead. \nMost companies that have already reported have topped expectations: As of Friday, about 16.5 percent of S&P 500 companies have announced their quarterly earnings, with 81.5 percent of them topping expectations, according to FactSet. \nBut even with the seemingly good news, the 500-stock index was up around just half a percent last week. That has been attributed to several reasons, including guidance revisions and rising interest rates , among others. \nFirst-quarter results across S&P 500 companies were last estimated by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S to increase by 20 percent compared to one year ago.\nVote Vote to see results Total Votes: Not a Scientific Survey. Results may not total 100% due to rounding.\nâ€” CNBC's Fred Imbert contributed to this report.",
