The Wizards have won seven straight playoff games at home.\nDeMar DeRozan scored 23 points, and Kyle Lowry finished with 19 points for the Raptors, who committed 18 turnovers.\nAfter a back-and-forth first half, the Wizards extended their lead to as much as 20 in the third quarter. Wall hit a layup to cap a 13-3 run that put Washington in front 90-74. Ty Lawson hit a 3-pointer at the buzzer to give the Wizards a 101-82 lead heading into the fourth quarter.\nLowry knocked down a 3-pointer that cut the deficit to 13 at 106-93 with seven minutes to play. Beal answered with a jumper and Wall hit a layup to squash Toronto’s comeback hopes.\nToronto led by as many as nine in the first half, but couldn’t hold the lead against the hot-shooting Wizards.\nWashington shot 59.6 percent from the floor, including 5-of-9 from 3-point range, and led 69-61 at halftime. Beal and Wall combined for 40 of the Wizards’ points in the first half.\nWashington veteran Markieff Morris and Toronto rookie guard OG Anunoby exchanged shoves during a heated moment early in the first quarter. Morris and Anunoby each were assessed technical fouls.\nThe game stayed testy into the second half. Serge Ibaka and Wall had to be separated in the third quarter, and Jonas Valanciunas and Beal also had a minor altercation during a dead ball.\nToronto sixth man Fred Van Vleet missed his second game of the series as he deals with a shoulder injury. He is listed as day-to-day.\n—Field Level Media\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
