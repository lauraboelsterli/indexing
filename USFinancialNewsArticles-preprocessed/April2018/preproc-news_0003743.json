    "text": "The Kremlin said on Monday no planning discussions had been held on a proposed summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump since the U.S. leader proposed the meeting in a phone call on March 20.\nSince then, Washington expelled 60 Russian diplomats and closed the Russian consulate in Seattle over allegations of a Russian role in the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei\nSkripal and his daughter. Russia retaliated in kind.\n\"Against the backdrop of these events, it's difficult to discuss the possibility of holding a summit,\" Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov told a news briefing.\n\"We want to believe that the discussions (on a proposed summit) will begin,\" Ushakov said. \"We want to hope that... one day, at one time or another we can arrive at the start of a serious and constructive dialogue.\"",
