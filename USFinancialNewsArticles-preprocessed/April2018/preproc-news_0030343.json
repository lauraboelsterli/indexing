    "text": "(Reuters) - The United States imposed a fresh set of sanctions on 24 Russian oligarchs, government officials and 12 Russian companies earlier this month, sending shockwaves through Russian financial markets.\nRussian lawmakers will next month consider measures in response to the U.S. sanctions that would ban or restrict certain U.S. imports.\nThe escalation in political tensions has led to increasing investor concerns about the potential implications for U.S. and European businesses that have exposure to Russia, Goldman Sachs (GS) notes.\nBelow is an overview of European companies with a significant presence in Russia.\nOTHER Source: Thomson Reuters data, Goldman Sachs, company websites\nCompiled by Anna Pruchnicka, additional reporting by Kateryna Urbanek; Editing by Adrian Croft\n ",
