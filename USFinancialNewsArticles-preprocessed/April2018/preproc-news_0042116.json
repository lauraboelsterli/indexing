    "text": "April 22, 2018 / 5:39 PM / Updated 2 minutes ago Aussie pilot Hall soars to victory in Cannes Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Australian pilot Matt Hall claimed victory in the second leg of the Red Bull Air Race world championship in Cannes, France on Sunday, edging German Matthias Dolderer in an intense final four battle. \nHall crossed the lined with a time of 57.692 seconds to record his first victory since he started racing in the Edge 540 at the start of last season. \nDolderer finished just 0.072 seconds behind, while American Michael Goulian, who topped Saturdayâ€™s qualifying session, took the third spot. \nReigning world champion Yoshihide Muroya was the fourth pilot in the final four battle, but a two-second penalty for incorrect level flying at Gate 8 had put an end to the hope of a podium finish. \nGoulian retained the top spot in the overall standings with 24 points, with Hall only three points behind and Muroya is third with 19 points. \nThe pilots will next compete in the third leg in Chiba, Japan on May 26-27.
