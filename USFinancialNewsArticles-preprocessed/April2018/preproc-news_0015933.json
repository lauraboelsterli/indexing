    "text": "CNBC 100 --- \nSouth Korea's Kospi index, meanwhile, erased earlier losses to close higher by 0.27 percent at 2,450.74 despite the move lower in major technology names. \nElsewhere, China markets were in positive territory. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index bounced 1.82 percent by 3:00 p.m. HK/SIN after its tentative open in the morning. The materials sector outperformed the broader index, trading up 3.65 percent ahead of the market close. \nOn the mainland, the Shanghai composite gained 1.67 percent to end at 3,190.65 and the Shenzhen composite rose 0.51 percent to finish at 1,841.22. \nDown Under, the S&P/ASX 200 advanced 0.83 percent to 5,857, as the energy, materials and financials subindexes all recorded gains of more than 1 percent. \nDow Jones industrial average futures were higher by 283 points in Asia afternoon trade. \n\"The market is reacting positively to the speech and many points [Xi] highlighted in the speech were actually well anticipated by many of the domestic observers here in China,\" Hao Hong, chief strategist at Bank of Communications International, told CNBC's \" Street Signs .\" \nHe pointed to better market access and the lifting of foreign ownership caps as examples of those measures. \nMasayuki Kubota, chief strategist at Rakuten Securities in Japan, said the improvement in market sentiment was a result of Xi's speech, which reduced fears over the threat of a U.S.-China trade war. \nInvestors had been on edge over the possibility of a trade war happening in recent sessions, but the improvement in risk appetite saw the greenback gain against the safe haven Japanese currency. \nAgainst the yen , the dollar firmed to trade at 107.15 by 2:48 p.m. HK/SIN, compared to levels around the 106.9 handle seen before Xi's speech. \nMeanwhile, the Australian dollar , which tends to be sensitive to Chinese economic news, strengthened 0.47 percent to $0.7733. \nThe dollar index was mostly steady at 89.886. \nMarkets in the region had traded mixed ahead of Xi's speech, which had been anticipated amid heightened U.S.-China trade tensions in recent weeks. Trade tit-for-tat \nXi's remarks on Tuesday came on the back of President Donald Trump's announcement on Friday that he had instructed U.S. trade officials to consider an additional $100 billion in tariffs on Chinese imports. \nThat followed China's Wednesday announcement that it would introduce extra tariffs on 106 U.S. products, including soybeans, although no start date was given. \nTrump said in a tweet on Sunday that he expected China would remove its trade barriers, adding that the U.S. and China had a \"[g]reat future\" ahead. On Monday, however, the president criticized China in a separate tweet for what he called \"STUPID TRADE.\" \nU.S. stock indexes rose on Monday, but finished the day well off session highs following a report that FBI officers had raided the office of Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime personal lawyer. \nStocks stateside had rallied earlier in the overnight session after recent U.S.- China trade tensions appeared to ease following a week largely dominated by trade-related developments. \nDisclosure: Larry Kudlow is a former CNBC contributor. \nâ€” CNBC's Huileng Tan contributed to this report.",
