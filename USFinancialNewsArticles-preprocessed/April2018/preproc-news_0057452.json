    "text": "LIMA, April 26 (Reuters) - Economic activity in Peru has continued to lag due to lower internal demand, Economy Minister David Tuesta said on Thursday.\nSpeaking to an economists’ conference sponsored by Thomson Reuters, Tuesta said Peru’s 2018 growth potential has fallen to 3.5 percent. On the positive side, he said he expects the country’s fiscal deficit to shrink to 1.0 percent of gross domestic product by 2021 from a projected 3.5 percent in 2018.
