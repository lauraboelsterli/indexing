    "text": "Los Angeles, CA, April 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- US Nuclear Corp. (OTCBB: UCLE):\n2017 Annual Highlights\nTotal sales revenue of $3,070,646 , an increase of 46.4% compared to the previous year Gross profit for 2017 was $1,344,913, an increase of 72% compared to the previous year Profitable net income of $10,130 Gross margin increased to 43.8% as compared to 36.9% the previous year General and administrative expense increased by 17.2% due to costs in developing and marketing new products, specifically the Drone-RAD UAV line\n“We’re thrilled to report on a successful year in 2017 with total sales revenue growth of 46.4%,” commented Robert Goldstein, CEO of US Nuclear Corp. “The increase in revenue was due to robust sales of our signature air monitors to nuclear power plants in addition to the popular demand of our tritium air monitors, which included a large contract with the USAF. Gross margin is increasing as we finish R&D on several new products that are being brought to the market. Overall, 2017 was a very strong year for us, but we are not at our full manufacturing capacity yet and will focus our efforts in 2018 to increase volume even further by capturing more of the global tritium monitor market, focusing on business from new power plant and fusion development, and introducing our new products mentioned above.”\nAbout US Nuclear Corp.\nUS Nuclear Corp is a fully-reporting, publicly traded company on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, traded under the ticker symbol UCLE.
