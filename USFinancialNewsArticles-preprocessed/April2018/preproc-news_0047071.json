    "text": "AKRON, Ohio, April 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- FirstEnergy Corp. (NYSE: FE) today reported first quarter 2018 GAAP earnings of $1.2 billion or $2.55 per basic share ($2.54 diluted), on revenues of $3 billion, primarily reflecting a gain on the deconsolidation of FirstEnergy Solutions Corp. (FES), its subsidiaries and FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company (FENOC) as a result of their bankruptcy filings on March 31, 2018. In the first quarter of 2017, the company recorded GAAP earnings of $205 million, or $0.46 per basic and diluted share of common stock, on revenue of $2.9 billion. GAAP earnings for both periods include the impact of special items listed below.\nOperating (non-GAAP) earnings* were $0.67 per share for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $0.52 per share in the first quarter of 2017.\n\"Eighteen months ago, we announced our plan to move away from commodity-exposed generation, so our company could fully focus on the tremendous opportunities in our regulated businesses,\" said Charles E. Jones, FirstEnergy president and chief executive officer. \"Today, we are pleased to report strong earnings that represent FirstEnergy as a fully regulated company, and to reaffirm our guidance and growth projections.\"\nThe company raised its forecast for 2018 GAAP earnings to a range of $3.61 to $3.91 per share, and affirmed its full-year operating (non-GAAP) earnings guidance range of $2.25 to $2.55 per share. In addition, the company is providing a second quarter GAAP earnings forecast range of $(0.06) to $0.04 per share, and operating (non-GAAP) earnings guidance range of $0.47 to $0.57 per share.\nIn FirstEnergy's Regulated Distribution business, first quarter 2018 earnings increased compared to the same period in 2017 as a result of higher weather-related usage, rates that went into effect in Ohio and Pennsylvania and lower expenses. These factors were partially offset by higher depreciation and general taxes.\nHeating degree days in the company's utility service area were 17 percent higher than the same period of 2017. The colder weather drove a 5 percent increase in total distribution deliveries compared to the first quarter of 2017, including an 8.1 percent increase in residential sales and 3.6 percent increase in deliveries to commercial customers. Deliveries to industrial customers increased 2.8 percent, primarily due to higher usage in the shale gas and steel sectors. This marked the seventh consecutive quarterly increase in the company's industrial distribution sales.\nIn the Regulated Transmission business, first quarter earnings benefited from the implementation of approved settlement rates at Jersey Central Power & Light and a higher rate base associated with the company's continued investments in the Energizing the Future transmission initiative.\nIn Corporate/Other, results for the first quarter of 2018 reflect the impact of higher taxes and net financing costs, partially offset by higher commodity margin at the Pleasants Power Station related to higher wholesale prices and lower operating expenses.\nConsolidated GAAP Earnings Per Share to Operating (Non-GAAP)\nEPS* Reconciliation\nThree Months Ended March 31\n2018 Estimates\n2018\n2017\nSecond\nQuarter\nFull\nYear\nBasic Earnings Per Share (GAAP)\n$ 2.55\n$ 0.46\n($0.06) - $0.04\n$ 3.61 - $3.91\nExcluding Special Items*:\nImpact of full dilution to 538M shares\n–\n(0.08)\n0.32\n0.29\nRegulatory charges\n0.01\n0.02\n0.01\n0.04\nMark-to-market adjustments\n(0.01)\n–\n–\n(0.01)\nExit of competitive generation\n(1.88)\n0.12\n–\n(1.88)\nDebt redemption costs\n–\n–\n0.20\n0.20\nTotal Special Items*\n(1.88)\n0.06\n0.53\n(1.36)\nOperating EPS (non-GAAP)\n$0.67\n$0.52\n$0.47 - $0.57\n$2.25 - $2.55\nPer share amounts for the special items and earnings drivers above are based on the after-tax effect of each item divided by number of shares outstanding assuming full impact of dilution from the $2.5 billion equity issuance in January 2018 (538M fully diluted shares). The current and deferred income tax effect was calculated by applying the subsidiaries' statutory tax rate to the pretax amount. The income tax rates range from 21% to 29% and 35% to 38% in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nNon-GAAP financial measures\n*Operating earnings (loss) excludes \"special items\" as described below, and is a non-GAAP financial measure. Special items represent charges incurred or benefits realized that management believes are not indicative of, or may obscure trends useful in evaluating the company's ongoing core activities and results of operations or otherwise warrant separate classification. Special items also reflect the adjustment to include the full impact of share dilution from the $2.5 billion equity issuance in January 2018. Special items are not necessarily non-recurring. Management uses Operating earnings (loss) and Operating earnings (loss) per share to evaluate the company's performance and manage its operations and frequently references these non-GAAP financial measures in its decision making, using them to facilitate historical and ongoing performance comparisons. Operating earnings (loss) per share, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated by dividing Operating earnings (loss), which excludes specials items as discussed herein, for the periods presented by 538 million shares, which reflects the full impact of share dilution from the equity issuance in January 2018. As of the first quarter 2018, Regulated operating (non-GAAP) earnings (loss), Regulated operating earnings (loss) per share, and Regulated operating earnings (loss) per share by segment, which were non-GAAP financial measures used in the guidance provided in February 2018, are now referred to as Operating earnings (loss), Operating earnings (loss) per share, and Operating earnings (loss) per share by segment, respectively. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures of Operating earnings (loss) and Operating earnings (loss) per share provide consistent and comparable measures of performance of its businesses on an ongoing basis. Management also believes that such measures are useful to shareholders and other interested parties to understand performance trends and evaluate the company against its peer group by presenting period-over-period operating results without the effect of certain charges or benefits that may not be consistent or comparable across periods or across the company's peer group. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures are intended to complement, and are not considered as alternatives to, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Also, the non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities.\nDeconsolidation\nAs a result of the bankruptcy filings, FirstEnergy Solutions (FES), its subsidiaries and FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Company (FENOC) were deconsolidated from FirstEnergy's consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2018. Additionally, the operating results of FES and FENOC, as well as Bay Shore Power Company and a portion of AE Supply, LLC that were subject to completed or pending asset sales, collectively representing substantially all of FirstEnergy's operations that comprised the Competitive Energy Services (CES) reportable operating segment, will be presented as discontinued operations in Corporate/Other. The remaining business activities that previously comprised the CES reportable operating segment were not material, and as such, have been combined into Corporate/Other for reporting purposes. The external segment reporting is consistent with the internal financial reports used by FirstEnergy's Chief Executive Officer (its chief operating decision maker) to regularly assess performance of the business and allocate resources. Disclosures for FirstEnergy's reportable operating segments for 2017, including the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures, have been revised to conform to the current presentation.\nConsolidated Report and Teleconference\nFirstEnergy's Consolidated Report to the Financial Community, which provides highlights on company developments and financial results for the first quarter, is posted on the company's Investor Information website – www.firstenergycorp.com/ir .
