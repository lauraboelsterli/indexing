    "text": "Extensive research demonstrates that the gender pay gap exists, but there are many skeptics who still think otherwise.\nAccording to the Institute for Women's Policy and Research (IWPR) and the American University of American Women , U.S. women working full-time earned just $0.80 for every dollar earned by a man in 2016. At this rate of change, women are expected to reach pay equity with men in 2059.\nThe wage gap widens even more when broken down by race. Black women make $0.63 for every dollar, while Latina women earn $0.54 cents. For women of color, the timeline for pay equity is even longer; the IWPR found that Latina women would have to wait until 2233 and black women until 2124.\nBut even with statistics like these, some deny that the gender pay gap exists, or downplay its consequences. According to Ellevest , an woman-focused online investing platform, only 61 percent of men believe that men earn more than women for doing the same job.\nThe other 39 percent of men either do not believe the gap is real, or chose not to answer the survey question. But women view things differently: 83 percent of women surveyed say they believe there is a gender wage gap.\nIn honor of Equal Pay Day, the annual date that symbolizes when women's earnings finally catch up to what men earned the year prior, we've compiled a list of the top six arguments against the gender pay gap, and how to counter them.\n1. Women leave the workforce to have kids It's not that women want to leave their jobs to take care of their children, it's that they're forced to. \"One problem is that a lot of men and women in the United States don't have paid family leave ,\" says Kevin Miller, a senior researcher at the AAUW .\nAlthough women will take unpaid family leave, men won't, says Miller, which is due in part to gender norms. \"Research has found that men in particular refuse to take family leave if it's not paid,\" explains Miller. \"We expect women to take leadership in a way that we don't expect men.\"\nOne solution to this problem is to offer all employees paid family leave. However, Miller notes that even when companies do offer paid family leave, men are still less likely to use that benefit.\nDiscrimination against mothers also plays an important factor, says Miller. Research shows that, overall, when women in the workforce have children, they experience a pay cut. But when men have children, they receive an increase pay, which experts refer to as a \" fatherhood bonus .\"\n\"We see statistically that when men and women make the same choices, like having kids, that it has a different impact in that men's wages actually go up,\" says Miller. He also points out that rearing kids isn't a valid explanation as to why women as a whole earn less than men, because many women opt not to have children.\n\"Even when women stay in the workforce 100 percent of the time, never have kids, never leave the workforce â€” we're still experiencing a pay gap,\" says Miller.\n2. Men work harder and longer hours \nWhile it's true that women are",
