    "text": "2 COMMENTS BROOKFIELD, Conn.—A decade after the recession, Lana Corsano is still nervous.\nThe owner of Bolt Printing & Embroidery, a growing T-shirt printing company based in western Connecticut, is debt-free, with no single customer accounting for more than 1% of her overall revenue. She pays cash for her equipment, which she buys used and refurbishes.\n“I’m not interested in getting in over my head,” Ms. Corsano, 52 years old, said. “I’m not interested in building debt.”\nThe strategy comes from painful lessons learned 10 years ago, when the financial crisis tanked Ms. Corsano’s first company, which sold promotional products such as briefcases and customized golf balls to a small number of big financial firms.\nShortly before the crash, Ms. Corsano had taken out second and third mortgages on her home in Ridgefield, Conn., and opened lines of credit at the bank to expand her business, where she was hiring more employees and trying to launch a line of food products.\nThen the financial crisis hit, and banks stopped buying promotional items. Ms. Corsano filed for bankruptcy and lost her home at a time when she was the sole provider for her two teenage daughters.\n“It was absolutely catastrophic,” she said. “I will never, ever do that again.”\nSmall-business owners have reported a growing confidence in the economy in recent months. A January survey by the National Federation of Independent Business found that a record-high 32% of respondents felt that this is a good time to expand.\nSome effects of the recession, however, continue to linger, particularly when it comes to financing, said Molly Day, vice president of public affairs for the National Small Business Association.\n“I do think the landscape has changed pretty significantly, and not for the better,” Ms. Day said. “So many banks are not willing to lend to you.”\nLana Corsano launched Bolt Printing & Embroidery with two employees in 2009. She now employs 21 and is planning to expand the company. Photo: Jessica Hill for The Wall Street Journal While aggregate-lending volumes to large businesses have rebounded from the financial crisis, small-business lending is still down from its pre-crisis peak, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\nA nationwide survey of more than 10,000 small businesses in 2016 conducted with involvement from all of the Federal Reserve banks found that most firms used retained-business earnings and personal funds for the majority of their financing, with only 15% relying on external sources such as bank loans for their primary funding source.\nThe Fed’s survey found that most small businesses have outstanding debt, however. Many small businesses that have been unable to secure bank loans have turned to alternative lenders or credit cards for financing.\nIn Connecticut, Ms. Corsano said she decided to start her T-shirt printing business after seeing a need for low-cost custom apparel that could be quickly delivered. She avoided taking out bank loans by growing her business slowly and borrowing from friends and family to finance her $25,000 in start-up costs.\nWhen she launched the business with two employees in 2009, Ms. Corsano was printing T-shirts in a 1,000-square-foot industrial garage crammed with printing equipment. She now has 21 employees and rents a 10,000-square-foot facility where digital and traditional screen printers, as well as embroidery machines, churned out a little more than 500,000 personalized T-shirts and other textiles last year.\nReligious and political messages have been particularly popular in recent years. On Tuesday, workers were preparing an order for a Texas-based customer of about 50 orange T-shirts that said “Enough” in white lettering above a large peace sign and the hashtag “#nationalschoolwalkout,” which refers to an event that will be held April 20 to protest gun violence.\nThe company takes its orders almost exclusively online, using technology built and maintained in-house. Adapting her business to keep up with technology also is a legacy of the recession, which Ms. Corsano said made her realize that she couldn’t “fly under the radar and expect to have my business be secure.”\nTroy Dye, chief marketing officer for Capital One’s small business card division, said technology has had a major impact on shaping small companies since the financial crisis. More owners now view keeping up with the latest technology as a critical component to improving their businesses, he said.\n“I think that the recession really forced folks to take a hard look at their business model and say, ‘Wow, what I just went through was incredibly painful. The business model that I have right now, is it going to survive going forward?’ ” Mr. Dye said.\nMs. Corsano, who logged $2.7 million in sales last year, is buying more equipment with cash that she expects will allow her to reach $10 million in sales by 2020. She is looking to hire up to 10 new employees this year.\nA decade after the recession, Ms. Corsano is still unwilling to overextend herself. She said she agonized over a recent decision to buy new office furniture, and ended up purchasing the desks and chairs from IKEA.\n“I’m not willing to risk anything anymore,” Ms. Corsano said. “I don’t ever want to be in a position where I have to walk out of my door and tell people that I can’t keep them employed.”\nWrite to Kate King at Kate.King@wsj.com",
