The Company expects second quarter GAAP revenue to be in the range of $303 million to $305 million. Non-GAAP revenue adds back $1 million for the impact of an acquisition accounting adjustment recorded to reduce the GoTo’s Business’s deferred revenue balance to the fair value of the remaining obligation.\nEBITDA is expected to be in the range of $78 million to $79 million, or approximately 26% of GAAP revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $107 million to $108 million, or approximately 35% of non-GAAP revenue.\nNon-GAAP net income is expected to be in the range of $66 million to $67 million, or $1.25 to $1.26 per diluted share.

Non-GAAP and GAAP net income per diluted share is based on an estimated 53 million fully-diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\nIncluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition related costs and amortization, litigation-related expense, and excluding the acquisition accounting adjustments to revenue and amortization expense, the Company expects to report GAAP net income in the range of $1 million to $2 million, or $0.03 to $0.04 per diluted share.\nFiscal year 2018:\nThe Company expects full year 2018 non-GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.208 billion to $1.223 billion. The Company expects full year 2018 GAAP revenue to be in the range of $1.205 billion to $1.220 billion. Non-GAAP revenue adds back $3 million for the impact of an acquisition accounting adjustment recorded to reduce GoTo’s deferred revenue balance to the fair value of the remaining obligation.\nEBITDA is expected to be in the range of $375 million to $383 million, or approximately 31% of GAAP revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $442 million to $450 million, or approximately 37% of non-GAAP revenue.\nNon-GAAP net income is expected to be in the range of $276 million to $282 million, or $5.20 to $5.31 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income adds back the non-GAAP revenue adjustment described above and excludes an estimated $76 million in stock-based compensation expense, $22 million in acquisition and litigation-related costs, $246 million of amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, a $34 million pre-tax gain associated with the disposition of a non-core asset and includes $8 million of amortization expense for GoTo’s internally capitalized software development costs that were adjusted in acquisition accounting to fair value, as well as the income tax effect of the above items and discrete tax items.\nNon-GAAP net income for the fiscal year assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 25% and GAAP net income for the fiscal year assumes a tax provision of approximately $20 million. Non-GAAP and GAAP net income per diluted share is based on an estimated 53 million fully-diluted weighted average shares outstanding.\nIncluding stock-based compensation expense, acquisition related costs and amortization, litigation related expense, and excluding the acquisition accounting adjustments to revenue and amortization expense, the Company expects to report GAAP net income in the range of $45 million to $51 million, or $0.85 to $0.96 per diluted share.\nDividend\nIn accordance with its previously announced capital return plan, the Company will pay a $0.30 per share dividend on Friday May 25, 2018 to stockholders of record as of May 9, 2018. The Company currently has approximately 52.2 million shares of common stock outstanding.\nConference Call Information for Today, Thursday, April 26, 2018\nThe Company will host a corresponding conference call and live webcast at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time today.

An audio replay of the call will also be available to investors beginning at approximately 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on April 26, 2018 until 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on May 4, 2018, by dialing 719-457-0820 and entering passcode 1193853.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP revenue, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP income before provision for income taxes, non-GAAP provision for income taxes, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share and adjusted cash flow from operations.\nNon-GAAP revenue is GAAP revenue excluding the impact of fair value acquisition accounting adjustment on acquired GoTo’s deferred revenue. EBITDA is GAAP net income excluding provision for income taxes, interest income, interest expense, and other (expense) income, net, and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing EBITDA by revenue. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA excluding the impact of fair value acquisition accounting adjustment on acquired GoTo’s deferred revenue, acquisition related costs, gain on disposition of non-core assets, stock-based compensation expense, and litigation related expense. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by non-GAAP revenue, or GAAP revenue if not different. Non-GAAP operating income excludes the impact of fair value acquisition accounting adjustment on acquired deferred revenue, acquisition related costs and amortization, gain on disposition of non-core assets, stock-based compensation expense, and litigation related expense and includes amortization expense for GoTo’s internally capitalized software development costs that were adjusted in acquisition accounting to fair value. Non-GAAP provision for income taxes excludes the tax impact of the fair value acquisition accounting adjustment on acquired deferred revenue, acquisition related costs and amortization, gain on disposition of non-core assets, stock-based compensation expense, litigation related expense, discrete integration related tax impacts, and the tax impact related to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (tax of $0.7 million recorded in the first quarter of 2018), and includes the tax impact of amortization expense for GoTo’s internally capitalized software development costs that were adjusted in acquisition accounting to fair value. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share reflects the adjustments noted in non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP provision for income taxes above. Adjusted cash flow from operations excludes acquisition, disposition and litigation related payments.\nThe exclusion of certain expenses in the calculation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that these costs are unusual or infrequent. We anticipate excluding these expenses in the future presentation of our non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the Company's financial condition and results of operations. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP measures to compare the Company's performance to that of prior periods and uses these measures in financial reports prepared for management and the Company's board of directors. The Company believes that the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing the Company's financial measures with other software-as-a-service companies, many of which present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. The Company does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is that they exclude significant elements that are required by GAAP to be recorded in the Company's financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. In order to compensate for these limitations, management of the Company presents its non-GAAP financial measures in connection with its GAAP results. The Company urges investors to review the reconciliation of its non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures, which it includes in press releases announcing quarterly financial results, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate the Company's business. Reconciliation tables of the most comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP measures used in this press release are included in this release.\nAbout LogMeIn, Inc.\nLogMeIn, Inc.
