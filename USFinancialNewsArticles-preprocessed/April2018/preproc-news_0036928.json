    "text": "CHICAGO, April 16 (Reuters) - Chicago Mercantile Exchange live cattle futures were mostly weaker on Monday, with traders locking in profits after prices rose on Friday.\nLingering concerns over a snowstorm that covered northern areas of the Midwest and Plains provided support to some nearby contracts, a trader said.\nBut overall, supplies were expected to remain plentiful, keeping a bearish tone hanging over the market.\nApril live cattle closed 0.60 cent per pound higher at 117.15 cents. June ended up 0.525 cent to 104.175 cents. Other deferred live cattle contracts were weaker.\nCME feeder cattle were steady to weak.\nApril dropped 0.15 cent per pound to 139.225 cents.\nHog futures contracts weakened.\nMay hogs closed down 1.525 cent per pound at 68.175 cents. Most actively traded June ended 0.850 cent lower at 76.800 cents. (Reporting by Mark Weinraub Editing by James Dalgleish)\n ",
