    "text": "Reblog Google parent Alphabet Inc. said its workers earned a median pay package of more than $197,000 last year, the fourth-highest pay among the hundreds of companies in the S&P 500 index that have disclosed those figures. The relatively high pay at two of the world’s biggest tech firms is a sign of the talent war in Silicon Valley, where talented engineers are in limited supply. Facebook and Google also dwarfed another tech giant in this category, Amazon.com Inc., where a median worker makes just $28,446.",
