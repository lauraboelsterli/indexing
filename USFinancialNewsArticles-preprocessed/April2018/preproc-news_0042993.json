    "text": "CONWAY, Ark., April 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Home BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOMB), parent company of Centennial Bank, today announced a quarterly profit of $73.1 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $46.9 million, for the same quarter in 2017, which represents a $26.2 million or 55.9% increase. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.42 per share compared to $0.33 per share for 2017, representing an increase of $0.09 per share or 27.3% for the first quarter of 2018 when compared to the same quarter in the prior year.\n“Our first quarter earnings were $73.1 million and $97.0 million before taxes, both of which are records for Home,” said John Allison, Chairman. “We achieved an impressive return on average assets of 2.08%, which combined with our 37.83% efficiency ratio, has us positioned for another year of solid returns for our shareholders.”\nTracy French, Centennial Bank President and Chief Executive Officer, added, “We are pleased to deliver strong financial results for the first quarter while continuing to maintain high asset quality. We maintained a non-performing assets to total assets ratio below 50 basis points and originated over $575 million in loans during the quarter. In addition, our conversion teams completed the system conversion of Stonegate during the quarter which will provide opportunity for continued efficiencies.”\n“We are proud to report our most profitable quarter in the Company’s history,” said Randy Sims, Home BancShares, Inc. Chief Executive Officer. “Diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.42 per share which was an increase of $0.09 or 27.3% from the first quarter of 2017. With outstanding performance results such as these, our shareholders can remain confident that we continue to focus on providing them with solid returns.”\nOperating Highlights\nNet interest margin, on a fully taxable equivalent basis, was 4.46% for the quarter just ended compared to 4.70% for the same quarter in 2017 and compared to 4.47% for the fourth quarter of 2017. Net interest margin for the first quarter of 2018 includes accretion income of $10.6 million and average purchase accounting loan discounts of $164.1 million, compared to accretion income of $7.6 million and average purchase accounting loan discounts of $102.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. Accretion yield decreased approximately $1.8 million from $12.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 to $10.6 million for first quarter of 2018.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a provision for loan loss of $1.6 million compared to $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, net charge-offs were $1.7 million compared to net charge-offs of $3.6 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Company reported $25.8 million of non-interest income for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $22.7 million, excluding gain on acquisitions for the first quarter of 2017. The most important components of the first quarter non-interest income were $10.2 million from other service charges and fees, $6.1 million from service charges on deposits accounts, $2.7 million from mortgage lending income, $3.7 million from other income and $877,000 from dividends from FHLB, FRB, Bankers’ Bank & other.\nNon-interest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $63.4 million compared to $55.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. Excluding $6.7 million in merger expenses during the first quarter of 2017, non-interest expense increased $15.0 million from $48.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 to $63.4 million for the first quarter of 2018. This increase excluding merger expenses is primarily the result of $7.6 million growth in salaries and employee benefits expense and $2.3 million growth in occupancy and equipment expense resulting from the acquisition of Stonegate Bank in the 3rd quarter of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, our efficiency ratio improved to 37.83% from the 40.76% reported for first quarter of 2017.\nFinancial Condition\nTotal loans receivable were $10.33 billion at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Total deposits were $10.40 billion at March 31, 2018 compared to $10.39 billion at December 31, 2017. Total assets were $14.32 billion at March 31, 2018 compared to $14.45 billion at December 31, 2017.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Centennial CFG produced $63.8 million of organic loan growth, while the legacy footprints experienced a decline of $69.3 million. Centennial CFG had loans of $1.51 billion at March 31, 2018.\nNon-performing loans at March 31, 2018 were $14.5 million, $34.9 million, $42,000 and zero in the Arkansas, Florida, Alabama and Centennial CFG markets, respectively, for a total of $49.5 million. Non-performing loans as a percent of total loans were 0.48% as of March 31, 2018 compared to 0.43% as of December 31, 2017. Non-performing assets at March 31, 2018 were $25.2 million, $43.0 million, $1.4 million and zero in the Arkansas, Florida and Alabama and Centennial CFG markets, respectively, for a total of $69.6 million. Non-performing assets as a percent of total assets were 0.49% as of March 31, 2018 compared to 0.44% as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Company’s allowance for loan losses was $110.2 million at March 31, 2018, or 1.07% of total loans, compared to $110.3 million, or 1.07% of total loans, at December 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Company’s allowance for loan losses was 223% and 247% of its total non-performing loans, respectively.\nStockholders’ equity was $2.24 billion at March 31, 2018 compared to $2.20 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $33.9 million. The increase in stockholders’ equity is primarily associated with the $54.9 million increase in retained earnings offset by $16.9 million of comprehensive loss and the repurchase of $7.1 million of our common stock during the first quarter of 2018. Book value per common share was $12.89 at March 31, 2018 compared to $12.70 at December 31, 2017. Tangible book value per common share was $7.27 at March 31, 2018 compared to $7.07 at December 31, 2017, an annualized increase of 11.47%.\nBranches\nIn an effort to achieve efficiencies primarily from our acquisitions, during the first quarter, the Company closed five branches in the Central Florida Region, one branch in the South Florida Region and six branches in the Southeast Florida Region. The Company currently has 76 branches in Arkansas, 76 branches in Florida, 5 branches in Alabama and one branch in New York City.\nConference Call\nManagement will conduct a conference call to review this information at 1:00 p.m. CT (2:00 ET) on Thursday, April 19, 2018.

The Company’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures--including earnings, as adjusted; return on average assets excluding intangible amortization; return on average assets, as adjusted; return on average common equity excluding intangible amortization; efficiency ratio, as adjusted; tangible book value per common share; and the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio--to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance. These measures typically adjust GAAP performance measures to include the tax benefit associated with revenue items that are tax-exempt, as well as adjust income available to common shareholders for certain significant items or transactions. Since the presentation of these GAAP performance measures and their impact differ between companies, management believes presentations of these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the operating results of the Company’s business. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.\nWhere non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in the tables of this release.\nGeneral\nThis release contains forward-looking statements regarding the Company’s plans, expectations, goals and outlook for the future. Statements in this press release that are not historical facts should be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements of this type speak only as of the date of this news release. By nature, forward-looking statements involve inherent risk and uncertainties. Various factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: economic conditions, credit quality, interest rates, loan demand, the ability to successfully integrate new acquisitions, increased regulatory requirements as a result of our exceeding $10 billion in total assets, legislative and regulatory changes, technological changes and cybersecurity risks, competition from other financial institutions, changes in the assumptions used in making the forward-looking statements, and other factors described in reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including those factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 filed with the SEC on February 27, 2018.\nHome BancShares, Inc. is a bank holding company, headquartered in Conway, Arkansas.
