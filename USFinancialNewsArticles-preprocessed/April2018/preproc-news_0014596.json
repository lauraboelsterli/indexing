REUTERS/David Gray 0200 GREENE OUT OF GAMES WITH INJURY \nWales’ former world 400 metres champion Dai Greene has withdrawn from the Games with a hamstring injury. Greene won the European and Commonwealth titles in 2010 and was crowned world champion a year later in Daegu, South Korea. \n“I am really disappointed to miss out on what would have been my fourth Commonwealth Games,” the 31-year-old said. “It’s been an emotional 18 months and this is hard to take at such a late stage.” 0145 WALES PAIR WIN BOWLS GOLD \nDaniel Salmon and Marc Wyatt clinched Wales’ first gold medal on the bowls rink in the men’s pairs as they fought back from a 5-1 deficit to beat defending champions Paul Foster and Alexander Marshall of Scotland 12-10. \nThe Cook Islands’ Aidan Zittersteijn and Taiki Paniani took bronze with a 17-11 win over Malta’s Shaun Parnis and Brendan Aquilina. 0015 DECATHLON BEGINS AT ATHLETICS TRACK \nCanada’s Damian Warner began the defence of his decathlon title with a season’s best 10.29 seconds in the 100m. Jamaica’s Yohan Blake and Trinidad and Tobago’s Michelle-Lee Ahye will be bidding to be crowned the Commonwealth’s fastest sprinters with the 100m titles held later on day five, while world champion Tom Walsh is a heavy favourite for the men’s shotput.
