    "text": "April 27th, 2018 South America\nFormer Brazilian Finance Minister Antonio Palocci has struck a plea deal with federal investigators, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday, raising the stakes in a corruption scandal engulfing high-ranking politicians and prominent businessmen.\nRepresentatives for Palocci, federal police and federal prosecutors did not respond to requests for comment. The plea deal was first reported by the O Globo newspaper.\nPalocci served as finance minister under former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who is serving time for taking bribes, and as chief of staff under Lula’s successor Dilma Rousseff. He served as a key adviser to both leaders during their campaigns.\n reuters.com",
