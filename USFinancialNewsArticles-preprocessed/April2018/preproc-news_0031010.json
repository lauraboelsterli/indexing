REUTERS/Issei Kato/File Photo It did not cite a source for its report.\nThe weekly Shincho reported last week that Administrative Vice Finance Minister Junichi Fukuda went drinking with a female reporter recently at a bar near his house and asked to touch her breasts and kiss her. The magazine Quote: d Fukuda as denying the allegations.\nAsked by reporters on Monday to comment on the allegations, Fukuda said: “I will issue a comment today so please look at that.” He did not elaborate.\nFinance Minister Taro Aso told a parliamentary panel last week that Fukuda had spoken to him about the matter.\nFukuda said he met many people in a private capacity and it was not possible to verify every interaction but that he would be careful not to “be misunderstood” from now on, Aso said.\nReporting by Takashi Umekawa and Chang-Ran Kim; Editing by Richard Pullin and Michael Perry\n ",
