(2) Includes unvested restricted shares issued in accordance with the Company's equity incentive plan. (3) Tangible book value per share is computed by dividing total shareholders’ equity less goodwill and core deposit intangible, net by shares outstanding. Management believes that tangible book value per share is meaningful because it is a measure that the Company and investors commonly use to assess capital adequacy. (4) The Company and the Bank continue to meet all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. Capital ratios for the Company include the benefit of $26.8 million net proceeds from the sale of 2,738,096 shares of common stock in the second quarter of 2017. (5) Management believes the tangible common equity ratio is a useful measure of capital adequacy because it provides a meaningful base for period-to-period and company-to-company comparisons, which management believes will assist investors in assessing the capital of the Company and the ability of the Company to absorb potential losses. The tangible common equity ratio is calculated as total shareholders' equity less goodwill and core deposit intangible, net divided by total assets less goodwill and core deposit intangible, net.\nBALANCE SHEET OVERVIEW\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had total consolidated assets of $1.2 billion, gross loans of $900.4 million, allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”) of $12.3 million, total deposits of $1.0 billion, and shareholders’ equity of $127.7 million.\nTABLE 2 LOAN BALANCES BY TYPE - UNAUDITED (amounts in thousands) At March 31, At December 31, % of % of Change % of 2018 Total 2017 Total Amount % 2017 Total Commercial $ 137,870 15 % $ 138,674 18 % $ (804 ) (1 ) % $ 142,405 16 % Real estate - construction and land development 14,723 2 25,241 3 (10,518 ) (42 ) % 15,902 2 Real estate - commercial non-owner occupied 405,192 46 311,203 38 93,989 30 % 377,668 43 Real estate - commercial owner occupied 193,286 22 186,713 24 6,573 4 % 192,023 22 Real estate - residential - ITIN 40,425 4 44,211 5 (3,786 ) (9 ) % 41,188 5 Real estate - residential - 1-4 family mortgage 30,247 3 19,710 2 10,537 53 % 30,377 3 Real estate - residential - equity lines 30,520 3 33,019 4 (2,499 ) (8 ) % 30,347 3 Consumer and other 48,157 5 51,423 6 (3,266 ) (6 ) % 49,925 6 Gross loans 900,420 100 % 810,194 100 % 90,226 11 % 879,835 100 % Deferred fees and costs 1,713 1,446 267 1,710 Loans, net of deferred fees and costs 902,133 811,640 90,493 881,545 Allowance for loan and lease losses (12,295 ) (11,641 ) (654 ) (11,925 ) Net loans $ 889,838 $ 799,999 $ 89,839 $ 869,620 Average yield on loans during the quarter 4.92 % 4.72 % 0.20 4.77 % The Company recorded gross loan balances of $900.4 million at March 31, 2018, compared with $810.2 million and $879.8 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2017, respectively, an increase of $90.2 million and $20.6 million, respectively. The increase in gross loans compared to the same period a year ago and the prior period was driven by organic loan originations by our SBA division and by our expanded Sacramento commercial banking group.\nAverage loan balances were $883.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared with $806.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and $839.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $77.1 million or 10% and an increase of $44.9 million or 22% annualized, respectively.\nThe average yield on loans during the quarter was 4.92% compared to 4.72% and 4.77% for the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The current quarter income on loans of $10.7 million included $229 thousand from prepayment penalties and interest income from nonaccrual loans that were sold or repaid during the quarter which enhanced the average yield by ten basis points.\nTABLE 3 CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES - UNAUDITED (amounts in thousands) At March 31, At December 31, % of % of Change % of 2018 Total 2017 Total Amount % 2017 Total Cash and due from banks $ 16,247 6 % $ 18,315 7 % $ (2,068 ) (11 ) % $ 17,979 5 % Interest-bearing deposits in other banks 17,376 6 42,744 16 (25,368 ) (59 ) % 48,991 15 Total cash and cash equivalents 33,623 12 61,059 23 (27,436 ) (45 ) % 66,970 20 Investment securities: U.S. government and agencies 41,179 14 12,496 5 28,683 230 % 40,369 12 Obligations of state and political subdivisions 59,408 21 55,663 20 3,745 7 % 78,844 24 Residential mortgage backed securities and\ncollateralized mortgage obligations 125,567 43 82,392 30 43,175 52 % 114,592 34 Corporate securities 3,958 1 10,448 4 (6,490 ) (62 ) % 4,992 1 Commercial mortgage backed securities 25,520 9 16,522 6 8,998 54 % 26,641 8 Other asset backed securities 285 — 4,013 1 (3,728 ) (93 ) % 2,516 1 Total investment securities - AFS 255,917 88 181,534 66 74,383 41 % 267,954 80 Obligations of state and political\nsubdivisions - HTM — — 31,257 11 (31,257 ) (100 ) % — — Total investment securities - AFS\nand HTM 255,917 88 212,791 77 43,126 20 % 267,954 80 Total cash, cash equivalents and\ninvestment securities $ 289,540 100 % $ 273,850 100 % $ 15,690 6 % $ 334,924 100 % Average yield on interest-bearing due\nfrom banks and investment securities\nduring the quarter - (nominal) 2.45 % 2.17 % 0.28 2.30 % As of March 31, 2018, we maintained noninterest-bearing cash positions of $16.2 million and interest-bearing deposits of $17.4 million at the Federal Reserve Bank and correspondent banks. The reduction in cash and cash equivalents from December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018 reflects the seasonal decline in deposits which, in 2018, has been greater than it was in the prior two years.\nInvestment securities totaled $255.9 million at March 31, 2018, compared with $212.8 million and $268.0 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Our investment securities portfolio provides us with a secondary source of liquidity to fund higher yielding asset opportunities, such as loan originations. During the first quarter of 2018, we purchased 12 securities with a par value of $19.6 million and weighted average yield of 3.11% and sold 29 securities with a par value of $18.7 million and weighted average yield of 2.27%. The sales activity on available-for-sale securities resulted in $36 thousand in net realized gains. During the same period, we received $7.9 million in proceeds from principal payments, calls and maturities within the investment securities portfolio.\nAverage securities balances and weighted average tax equivalent yields for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 were $265.1 million and 2.75% compared to $211.1 million and 3.06%, respectively. The current quarter tax equivalent yields were reduced by 17 basis points as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 which reduced the federal corporate tax rate from a graduated rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%.\nAt March 31, 2018, our net unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities were $3.9 million compared with net unrealized losses of $891 thousand and $452 thousand at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The changes in the net unrealized loss on the investment securities portfolio are due to changes in market interest rates and the reclassification of all HTM securities to AFS during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nTABLE 4 DEPOSITS BY TYPE - UNAUDITED (amounts in thousands) At March 31, At December 31, % of % of Change % of 2018\nTotal 2017\nTotal Amount % 2017\nTotal Demand - noninterest-bearing $ 301,981 29 % $ 270,412 27 % $ 31,569 12 % $ 305,650 28 % Demand - interest-bearing 462,551 44 407,784 41 54,767 13 % 496,990 45 Total demand 764,532 73 678,196 68 86,336 13 % 802,640 73 Savings 107,986 10 112,738 11 (4,752 ) (4 ) % 110,837 10 Total non-maturing deposits 872,518 83 790,934 79 81,584 10 % 913,477 83 Certificates of deposit 176,233 17 213,556 21 (37,323 ) (17 ) % 189,255 17 Total deposits $ 1,048,751 100 % $ 1,004,490 100 % $ 44,261 4 % $ 1,102,732 100 % Average rate on interest-bearing\ndeposits during the quarter 0.41 % 0.39 % 0.02 0.42 % Average rate on all\ndeposits during the quarter 0.29 % 0.29 % - 0.30 % Total deposits at March 31, 2018, increased $44.3 million or 4% to $1.0 billion compared to March 31, 2017, and decreased $54.0 million or 20% annualized compared to December 31, 2017.

In the current quarter, net interest income was $1.6 million higher and provision for loan and lease losses was $200 thousand lower. These positive changes were offset by noninterest income that was $489 thousand lower, noninterest expense that was $43 thousand higher and a provision for income tax that was $290 thousand higher.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income increased $1.6 million compared to the same period a year ago.\nInterest income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $1.7 million or 16% to $12.5 million. Interest and fees on loans increased $1.3 million due to a $77.1 million increase in average loan balances and a 20 basis point increase in the average yield on the loan portfolio. Interest on securities increased $353 thousand due to a $54.0 million increase in average securities balances and a two basis point increase in the average yield on the securities portfolio. Interest on interest-bearing deposits due from banks increased $15 thousand primarily due to a 78 basis point increase in average yield resulting from increased fed funds rates.\nInterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 increased $102 thousand or 9% to $1.2 million. The net increase was due to the following:\nInterest expense on interest bearing deposits increased $51 thousand. Average interest-bearing demand and savings deposit balances increased $47.1 million, while average certificate of deposit balances decreased $33.3 million. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased two basis points.\nInterest expense on other interest bearing liabilities increased $51 thousand primarily due to increased borrowing from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco.\nProvision for loan and lease loss\nAs a result of continued improved asset quality and net loan loss recoveries, no provision for loan and lease losses was necessary during the current quarter compared with a provision for loan and lease losses of $200 thousand for the same quarter a year ago.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased $489 thousand compared to the first quarter for 2017. During the first quarter of 2017 we recognized income from life insurance death benefit proceeds of $502 thousand.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased only $43 thousand compared to the same period a year previous.\nThe Company’s efficiency ratio was 65.17% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 71.31% during the same period in 2017.\nIncome Tax Provision\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, our income tax provision of $1.1 million on pre-tax income of $4.3 million was an effective tax rate of 24.5%. The current quarter effective tax rate reflects the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 which reduced the federal corporate tax rate from a graduated rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%. The tax provision for the first quarter of the prior year was $763 thousand on pre-tax income of $3.0 million for an effective tax rate of 25.31%. Life insurance death benefits of $502 thousand recorded during the first quarter of 2017 are not subject to income tax, and if excluded from pretax income, the effective tax rate would have been 30.36%.\nFirst Quarter of 2018 Compared With Fourth Quarter of 2017\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 increased $3.2 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. In the current quarter, net interest income was $476 thousand higher, the provision for loan and lease losses was $450 thousand lower and the provision for income taxes was $2.8 million lower. These positive changes were offset by noninterest income that was $300 thousand lower and noninterest expenses that were $142 thousand higher.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income increased $476 thousand over the prior quarter.\nInterest income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $483 thousand or 4% to $12.5 million. Interest and fees on loans increased $646 thousand due to a $44.9 million increase in average loan balances and a 15 basis point increase in the average yield on the loan portfolio. Interest on investment securities decreased $68 thousand due to a $6.9 million decrease in average securities balances partially offset by a two basis point increase in average yield. Interest on interest-bearing deposits due from banks decreased $95 thousand due to a $34.1 million decrease in average balances.\nInterest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $7 thousand or 1% to $1.2 million. Interest expense on deposits declined $42 thousand as average interest-bearing demand and savings deposits increased $10.0 million, average certificates of deposit declined $13.0 million and the average rate paid on these deposits declined one basis point. This was offset by new borrowings from the Federal Home loan Bank of San Francisco which averaged $12.4 million and carried interest expense of $47 thousand. Variances in interest expense on other term debt were immaterial.\nProvision for loan and lease loss\nAs a result of continued improved asset quality and net loan loss recoveries, no provision for loan and lease losses was necessary during the current quarter compared with a provision for loan and lease losses of $450 thousand for the prior quarter.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased $300 thousand. During the current quarter gains on sale of OREO were $16 thousand compared to gains on sale of OREO of $346 thousand in the prior quarter.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $142 thousand compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily related to employee compensation.\nThe Company’s efficiency ratio was 65.17% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 64.94% during the prior quarter.\nIncome Tax Provision\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, our income tax provision of $1.1 million on pre-tax income of $4.3 million was an effective tax rate of 24.5%. This compares with a provision for income taxes of $3.8 million on pretax income of $3.8 million (99.8% effective tax rate) for the prior quarter. The income tax provision in the prior quarter included a $2.5 million write-down of our net deferred tax assets and if excluded from the calculation, the effective tax rate would have been 34.5%\nEarnings Per Share\nDiluted earnings per share were $0.20 for the three months ended March 31, 2018. This compared with diluted earnings per share of $0.17 for the same period a year ago and diluted earnings per share of $0.00 for the prior period. Net income and weighted average shares used to calculate earnings per share – diluted are summarized in table 6 presented earlier in this press release.\nThe following table presents the average cost of interest-bearing deposits, all deposits and all interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated.\nTABLE 7 AVERAGE COST OF FUNDS For The Three Months Ended March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 2016 2016 2016 Interest-bearing deposits 0.41 % 0.42 % 0.43 % 0.42 % 0.39 % 0.40 % 0.39 % 0.39 % Interest-bearing deposits and noninterest-bearing demand 0.29 % 0.30 % 0.31 % 0.31 % 0.29 % 0.29 % 0.29 % 0.30 % All interest-bearing liabilities 0.60 % 0.59 % 0.60 % 0.60 % 0.56 % 0.57 % 0.56 % 0.56 % All interest-bearing liabilities and noninterest-bearing demand 0.43 % 0.42 % 0.43 % 0.44 % 0.42 % 0.42 % 0.42 % 0.44 %\nTABLE 8a NET INTEREST MARGIN - UNAUDITED (amounts in thousands) For The Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 December 31, 2017 Average Yield / Average Yield / Average Yield / (Amounts in thousands) Balance Interest (1) Rate (5) Balance Interest (1) Rate (5) Balance Interest (1) Rate (5) Interest-earning assets: Net loans (2) $ 883,876 $ 10,729 4.92 % $ 806,793 $ 9,384 4.72 % $ 839,004 $ 10,083 4.77 % Taxable securities 205,302 1,209 2.39 % 137,582 789 2.33 % 199,849 1,211 2.40 % Tax-exempt securities 59,789 463 3.14 % 73,524 530 2.92 % 72,152 529 2.91 % Interest-bearing deposits\nin other banks 32,890 129 1.59 % 57,140 114 0.81 % 67,032 224 1.33 % Average interest-\nearning assets 1,181,857 12,530 4.30 % 1,075,039 10,817 4.08 % 1,178,037 12,047 4.06 % Cash and due from banks 17,666 16,873 19,783 Premises and equipment, net 14,557 16,165 14,948 Other assets 34,483 40,228 39,192 Average total assets $ 1,248,563 $ 1,148,305 $ 1,251,960 Interest-bearing liabilities: Interest-bearing demand $ 470,440 221 0.19 % $ 420,416 148 0.14 % $ 459,451 216 0.19 % Savings deposits 110,725 59 0.22 % 113,647 47 0.17 % 111,725 54 0.19 % Certificates of deposit 181,901 495 1.10 % 215,202 529 1.00 % 194,886 547 1.11 % Federal Home Loan Bank of San\nFrancisco borrowings 12,444 47 1.53 % — — — % — — — % Other borrowings net of unamortized\ndebt issuance costs 16,528 281 6.90 % 18,598 293 6.39 % 17,211 285 6.57 % Junior subordinated\ndebentures 10,310 82 3.23 % 10,310 66 2.60 % 10,310 76 2.92 % Average interest-\nbearing liabilities 802,348 1,185 0.60 % 778,173 1,083 0.56 % 793,583 1,178 0.59 % Noninterest-bearing demand 307,397 262,881 316,961 Other liabilities 11,749 12,431 12,554 Shareholders’ equity 127,069 94,820 128,862 Average liabilities and\nshareholders’ equity $ 1,248,563 $ 1,148,305 $ 1,251,960 Net interest income and\nnet interest margin (4) $ 11,345 3.89 % $ 9,734 3.67 % $ 10,869 3.66 % Tax equivalent net\ninterest margin (3) 3.94 % 3.78 % 3.75 % (1) Interest income on loans is net of deferred fees and costs of approximately $137 thousand, $197 thousand, and $123 thousand for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2018, and 2017 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

(3) Tax-exempt income has been adjusted to tax equivalent basis at a 21% for 2018 and at a 34% tax rate for 2017. The amount of such adjustments was an addition to recorded income of approximately $123 thousand, $273 thousand and $273 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 and December 31, 2017, respectively. (4) Net interest margin is net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest-earning assets.

As a result of continued improved asset quality and net loan loss recoveries, no provision for loan and lease losses was necessary during the current quarter. This compared with a provision of $200 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and a $450 thousand provision for loan and lease losses during the three months ended December 31, 2017. Our ALLL as a percentage of gross loans was 1.37% as of March 31, 2018 compared to 1.44% as of March 31, 2017 and 1.36% as of December 31, 2017. Based on the Bank’s ALLL methodology, which uses criteria such as risk factors and historical loss rates, and given the ongoing improvements in asset quality, management believes the Company’s ALLL is adequate at March 31, 2018. There is, however, no assurance that future loan and lease losses will not exceed the levels provided for in the ALLL and could possibly result in future charges to the provision for loan and lease losses.\nAt March 31, 2018, the recorded investment in loans classified as impaired totaled $11.5 million, with a corresponding specific reserve of $1.1 million compared to impaired loans of $16.8 million with a corresponding specific reserve of $1.3 million at March 31, 2017 and impaired loans of $13.1 million, with a corresponding specific reserve of $1.2 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in loans classified as impaired and nonaccrual loans compared to the prior quarter is primarily due to one commercial loan relationship and one commercial real estate loan that were paid off during the quarter. The decrease in the specific reserve on impaired loans compared to the prior quarter was primarily due to one commercial loan.\nTABLE 10 TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS - UNAUDITED (amounts in thousands) At March 31, At December 31, At September 30, At June 30, At March 31, 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 Nonaccrual $ 3,237 $ 3,581 $ 4,403 $ 4,630 $ 4,570 Accruing 7,246 7,348 6,572 6,666 6,760 Total troubled debt restructurings $ 10,483 $ 10,929 $ 10,975 $ 11,296 $ 11,330 Troubled debt restructurings as a percentage of total gross loans 1.16 % 1.24 % 1.33 % 1.39 % 1.40 % There were no new troubled debt restructurings during the three months ended March 31, 2018.

The increase in the OREO balance compared to the prior quarter is due to the transfer of three 1-4 family residential properties to OREO totaling $60 thousand offset by the disposition of one 1-4 family residential property for $35 thousand. Net gains on sale of OREO in the current quarter were $16 thousand compared to net losses of $71 thousand and net gains of $346 thousand in the same quarter a year ago and in the prior quarter, respectively.\nTABLE 12 UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET (amounts in thousands, except per share data) At March 31, At March 31, Change At December 31, 2018 2017 $ % 2017 Assets: Cash and due from banks $ 16,247 $ 18,315 $ (2,068 ) (11 ) % $ 17,979 Interest-bearing deposits in other banks 17,376 42,744 (25,368 ) (59 ) % 48,991 Total cash and cash equivalents 33,623 61,059 (27,436 ) (45 ) % 66,970 Securities available-for-sale, at fair value 255,917 181,534 74,383 41 % 267,954 Securities held-to-maturity, at amortized cost — 31,257 (31,257 ) (100 ) % — Loans, net of deferred fees and costs 902,133 811,640 90,493 11 % 881,545 Allowance for loan and lease losses (12,295 ) (11,641 ) (654 ) 6 % (11,925 ) Net loans 889,838 799,999 89,839 11 % 869,620 Premises and equipment, net 14,214 15,903 (1,689 ) (11 ) % 14,748 Other real estate owned 60 814 (754 ) (93 ) % 35 Life insurance 22,027 21,494 533 2 % 21,898 Deferred tax asset, net 7,523 9,363 (1,840 ) (20 ) % 6,505 Goodwill and core deposit intangible, net 1,975 2,196 (221 ) (10 ) % 2,030 Other assets 20,398 19,132 1,266 7 % 19,661 Total assets $ 1,245,575 $ 1,142,751 $ 102,824 9 % $ 1,269,421 Liabilities and shareholders' equity: Demand - noninterest-bearing $ 301,981 $ 270,412 $ 31,569 12 % $ 305,650 Demand - interest-bearing 462,551 407,784 54,767 13 % 496,990 Savings 107,986 112,738 (4,752 ) (4 ) % 110,837 Certificates of deposit 176,233 213,556 (37,323 ) (17 ) % 189,255 Total deposits 1,048,751 1,004,490 44,261 4 % 1,102,732 Term debt: Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco borrowings 30,000 — 30,000 100 % — Other borrowings 16,196 18,667 (2,471 ) (13 ) % 17,096 Unamortized debt issuance costs (127 ) (173 ) 46 (27 ) % (138 ) Net term debt 46,069 18,494 27,575 149 % 16,958 Junior subordinated debentures 10,310 10,310 — — % 10,310 Other liabilities 12,723 12,994 (271 ) (2 ) % 12,157 Total liabilities 1,117,853 1,046,288 71,565 7 % 1,142,157 Shareholders' equity: Common stock 51,959 24,800 27,159 110 % 51,830 Retained earnings 78,507 72,066 6,441 9 % 75,700 Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax (2,744 ) (403 ) (2,341 ) 581 % (266 ) Total shareholders' equity 127,722 96,463 31,259 32 % 127,264 Total liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 1,245,575 $ 1,142,751 $ 102,824 9 % $ 1,269,421 Total interest-earning assets $ 1,179,321 $ 1,068,066 $ 111,255 10 % $ 1,198,942 Shares outstanding 16,315 13,517 2,798 21 % 16,272 Book value per share $ 7.83 $ 7.14 $ 0.69 10 % $ 7.82 Tangible book value per share (1) $ 7.71 $ 6.97 $ 0.74 11 % $ 7.70 (1) Tangible book value per share is computed by dividing total shareholders’ equity less goodwill and core deposit intangible, net by shares outstanding.
