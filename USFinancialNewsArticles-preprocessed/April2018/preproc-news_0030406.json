    "text": "MILAN, April 12 (Reuters) - There are more than 100 expressions of interest from investors for a 500 million euro ($618 million) portfolio of unlikely-to-pay (UTP) loans Banca Carige has put up for sale, CEO Paolo Fiorentino said on Thursday.\nThe CEO added he expected to receive non-binding bids on April 23.\nA loan is classed as UTP when borrowers are still solvent but unlikely to repay their obligations in full.\nCarigeâ€™s latest plan to cut soured debts, approved at the end of March, envisages also a 1 billion euro bad loan sale this year.
