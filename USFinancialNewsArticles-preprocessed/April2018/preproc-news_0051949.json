    "text": "LIMA (Reuters) - Peru’s top court ruled that ex-President Ollanta Humala and his wife must be freed from jail, where they have been spent the past nine months awaiting trial over money laundering allegations that they deny, the president of the court said on Thursday.\nFILE PHOTO: Peru's former President Ollanta Humala and former first lady Nadine Heredia leave the Nationalist Party headquarters in Lima, Peru, July 13, 2017. REUTERS/Guadalupe Pardo Ernesto Blume warned that the use of “preventive prison,” or pre-trial detention, must not be overused as the country grapples with its biggest corruption scandal in nearly two decades.\nHumala and former first lady Nadine Heredia are two of several politicians, former government officials and business leaders who have been jailed pending trial in connection with Odebrecht, a Brazilian builder that has admitted to paying hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes across Latin America.\n“Preventive prison is not the general rule but an exception,” Blume said as he announced the court’s decision. The court “must guarantee the right to personal liberty as well as the presumption of innocence.”\nThe comments were a rare rebuke of the work of public prosecutors amid widespread outrage over Odebrecht’s bribes, and the ruling could mark a precedent as criminal investigations continue against other former presidents and politicians.\n“We have to be very careful.” Blume added. “Media justice is not justice. The only way to strengthen institutions and fight against corruption coherently is by acting constitutionally.”\nFormer President Alejandro Toledo has been fighting extradition from the United States to serve up to 18 months in preventive prison over allegations he took a $20 million bribe from Odebrecht. Former President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who resigned amid mounting graft allegations last month, has been barred from leaving the country while his ties to the company are probed.\nWorkers clean signs reading 'Ollanta and Nadine freedom!', during the trial of former President Ollanta Humala and his wife Nadine Heredia, in Lima, Peru April 26, 2018. REUTERS/Mariana Bazo Opposition leader Keiko Fujimori and her right-wing party are also under investigation.\nHumala, Heredia, Fujimori, Toledo and Kuczynski all deny wrongdoing.\nProsecutors accused Humala and Heredia, who was the leader of Humala’s nationalist party, of taking $3 million in illicit funds from Odebrecht to finance Humala’s 2011 campaign. They argued the couple might flee or obstruct their work unless jailed.\nBut as Humala and Heredia languished in prison without any formal charges against them, some in Peru argued their jailing was unfair, especially as other political leaders, such as Humala’s former rival Fujimori, remained free.\nBlume stressed the court was not weighing in on the accusations against Humala and Heredia and that the couple will have to comply with court-mandated restrictions while investigations continue.\nHumala had been sharing a prison with Fujimori’s father, former authoritarian leader Alberto Fujimori, until December, when Kuczynski pardoned Fujimori amid a political crisis.\nReporting By Mitra Taj and Ana Maria Cervantes; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ",
