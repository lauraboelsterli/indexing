    "text": "The U.S. Commerce Department said on Tuesday it has made a preliminary determination that aluminum sheet imports from China are being subsidized.\nThe Commerce Department calculated preliminary subsidy margins ranging from 31.20 to 113.30 percent of the value of the imported common alloy aluminum sheet.\nIn 2016, imports of common alloy aluminum sheet from China were valued at an estimated $600 million, the department said in a statement.\nThe department also said it was starting new investigations to determine if certain steel wheels from China are dumped in the United States and whether producers in China are receiving unfair subsidies.\nThose investigations followed complaints by Accuride Corporation and Maxion Wheels Akron, the department said in a statement. The alleged dumping margins range from 12.1 percent to 231.7 percent, and U.S. imports of the products from China in 2017 were estimated to total $388 million, it said.",
