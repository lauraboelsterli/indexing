    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said Sunday that the United States will not have any one-on-one talks with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\nFILE PHOTO: United States Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley speaks during the United Nations Security Council meeting on Syria at the U.N. headquarters in New York, U.S., April 13, 2018. REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz In an interview with CBS’ “Face the Nation,” Haley said Syria had so far refused to take part in multilateral negotiations as part of a political process facilitated by the United Nations, adding that Russia should “deliver” Syria to the negotiating table.\nBut she said Syria was not “worthy” of direct talks with Washington: “We are not going to have any one-on-one talks with Assad.”\nReporting by Susan Cornwell; Editing by Nick Zieminski\n ",
