    "text": "JOHANNESBURG, April 4 (Reuters) - South African construction group Murray & Roberts, currently the subject of a takeover bid by Germany’s ATON, said on Wednesday that an independent report showed that a fair offer for the company would be as much as 22 rand ($1.85) per share.\nThe firm said on Wednesday that ATON’s earlier offer of 15 rand per share “materially undervalues Murray & Roberts based on its prospects and is opportunistic” and that 20 to 22 rand per share was fair value. ($1 = 11.9126 rand) (Reporting by Tanisha Heiberg Editing by Alexander Winning)\n ",
