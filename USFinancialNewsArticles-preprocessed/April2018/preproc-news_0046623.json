    "text": "Company to evaluate strategy to upgrade its position in the public markets\nCHICAGO, IL, Alliance Creative Group, Inc. ( AllianceCreativeGroup.com ) (OTC: ACGX) is pleased to announce they have hired Brio Financial to assist with preparing for 2 years of PCAOB audits. Brio Financial will oversee the company’s public filings and audit preparation processes and assist with the evaluation of auditor firms to determine the best fit for the Company. The Company will continue to evaluate their options and the requirements associated with upgrading to a higher exchange in the public markets and will confirm once a final decision is made.\nPaul Sorkin , COO and General Counsel of the Alliance Creative Group, Inc., said, “We have been evaluating all options for the future of the Company and have decided to start with 2 years of PCAOB audits while we evaluate the possible strategies for upgrading our position in the public markets. We believe this will help reassure shareholders of the accuracy of our revenues and assets, increase the transparency, build greater confidence, and help us accomplish our long-term value-building goals. We will most likely upgrade to the OTCQB first, however, our long-term goal is to upgrade beyond the OTC Markets eventually. We believe our core foundation is strong and our shared resources business model will benefit more with increased visibility and a wider range of potential investors. David Briones and his team bring a wealth of experience in working with public companies like ours and will be invaluable as we go through this process.
