(NASDAQ GS: MINI) (the “Company” or “Mobile Mini”), the world’s leading supplier of portable storage solutions and a leading provider of tank and pump solutions in the United States, today reported actual and adjusted financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.

On an adjusted basis, first quarter net income was $14.9 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, as compared to adjusted net income of $10.9 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $48.6 million and adjusted EBITDA margin was 34.5% for the first quarter of 2018.\nDividend\nThe Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of 25.0 cents per share, which will be paid on May 30, 2018 to shareholders of record on May 16, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nDelivered a strong 21.7% year-over-year increase in Tank & Pump Solutions rental revenue growth. Achieved robust Storage Solutions rental revenue year-over-year growth of 13.9%, 11.5% when adjusted for favorable currency fluctuations. Improved OEC utilization for Tank & Pump Solutions, averaging 73.6% for the quarter, compared to 61.9% in the prior-year quarter. Increased total Storage Solutions average units on rent by 5.0% year-over-year, with average utilization of 70.6%. Raised Storage Solutions rental rates by 3.0% year-over-year, with rates on new rentals up 0.9%. Grew adjusted EBITDA of $48.6 million by 16.5% compared to the prior-year quarter, 14.7% in constant currency. Generated net cash from operating activities of $34.9 million and strong free cash flow of $18.8 million.\nCEO Comments\nErik Olsson, Mobile Mini’s President and Chief Executive Officer, remarked, “During the first quarter of 2018, we continued to capitalize on the momentum that we generated in the second half of 2017. I am very pleased with the 21.7% Tank & Pump Solutions rental revenue growth, which was broad-based, across multiple customer end-segments and geographies. North American Storage Solutions rental revenues increased a robust 14.6% in the current quarter and consolidated Storage Solutions rental revenues increased 11.5%. As a result of the hard work of our salesforce, our unique suite of technology tools, and the exceptional service provided by the field, our large national customers are recognizing the value proposition that Mobile Mini is able to deliver.”\nMr. Olsson continued, “Tank & Pump Solutions equipment on rent increased dramatically in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the prior year and we expect this level of utilization to continue into the next quarter with a healthy pipeline. In addition, with pending orders up significantly compared to this time last year, our North American Storage Solutions pipeline continues to be strong. In the U.K. our business remains flat as we continue to monitor the effects of BREXIT on our business. Overall, we expect to see strong year-over-year top line growth and expanded margins for the remainder of 2018.”\nConference Call\nMobile Mini will host a conference call today, Friday, April 20 at 12 noon ET to review these results.

These financial measures are not recognized measures under GAAP and they are not intended to be and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA margin, adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow and constant currency financial information are non-GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. This non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measurements to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measurements are furnished earlier in this release and as follows:\nMobile Mini, Inc. Adjusted EBITDA GAAP Reconciliations (Unaudited) (in thousands) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018 2017 Net income $ 14,855 $ 10,152 Interest expense 9,599 8,402 Income tax provision 4,949 5,330 Depreciation and amortization 16,823 15,264 EBITDA 46,226 39,148 Share-based compensation expense 2,229 1,311 Restructuring expenses 111 899 Acquisition-related expenses — 88 Other — 242 Adjusted EBITDA $ 48,566 $ 41,688 Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 34,931 $ 32,723 Interest paid 12,348 13,671 Income and franchise taxes paid 120 — Share-based compensation expense, including restructuring expense\n(2,229 ) (1,311 ) Gain on sale of rental fleet 1,533 1,703 Loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment\n(334 ) (18 ) Changes in certain assets and liabilities, net of effect of businesses acquired\n(143 ) (7,620 ) EBITDA $ 46,226 $ 39,148 Mobile Mini, Inc. Free Cash Flow GAAP Reconciliation (Unaudited) (in thousands) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 34,931 $ 32,723 Additions to rental fleet, excluding acquisitions (15,389 ) (10,006 ) Proceeds from sale of rental fleet 3,844 4,622 Additions to property, plant and equipment, excluding acquisitions\n(4,752 ) (3,748 ) Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment\n179 68 Net capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions (16,118 ) (9,064 ) Free cash flow $ 18,813 $ 23,659 Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Adjusted net income and related earnings per share information exclude certain transactions that management believes are not indicative of our business. We believe that the inclusion of this non-GAAP presentation makes it easier to compare our financial performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis.\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as net income before discontinued operations, net of tax (if applicable), interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and debt restructuring or extinguishment expense (if applicable), including any write-off of deferred financing costs. Adjusted EBITDA further excludes certain non-cash expenses, including share-based compensation, as well as transactions that management believes are not indicative of our business. Because EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, as defined, exclude some but not all items that affect our cash flow from operating activities, they may not be comparable to similarly titled performance measures presented by other companies.\nWe present EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA because we believe they provide useful information regarding our ability to meet our future debt payment requirements, capital expenditures and working capital requirements and an overall evaluation of our financial condition. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA have certain limitations as analytical tools and should not be used as substitutes for net income, cash flows from operations, or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins are calculated as EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, respectively, divided by total revenues expressed as a percentage.\nFree Cash Flow. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities, minus or plus, net cash used in or provided by investing activities, excluding acquisitions and certain transactions. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not intended to replace net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with GAAP. We present free cash flow because we believe it provides useful information regarding our liquidity and ability to meet our short-term obligations. In particular, free cash flow indicates the amount of cash available after capital expenditures for, among other things, investments in our existing business, debt service obligations, payment of authorized quarterly dividends, repurchase of our common stock and strategic small acquisitions.\nConstant Currency. We calculate the effect of currency fluctuations on current periods by translating the results for our business in the U.K. during the current period using the average exchange rates from the comparative period. We present constant currency information to provide useful information to assess our underlying business excluding the effect of material foreign currency rate fluctuations. Calculated in constant currency, our rental revenues and adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $2.2 million and $0.8 million lower than when calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180420005136/en/\nMobile Mini, Inc.\nVan Welch, 602-308-3879\nExecutive VP & Chief Financial Officer\nwww.mobilemini.com\nor\nInvestor Relations Counsel:\nThe Equity Group Inc.\nFred Buonocore, 212-836-9607\nKevin Towle, 212-836-9620\nSource: Mobile Mini, Inc.",
