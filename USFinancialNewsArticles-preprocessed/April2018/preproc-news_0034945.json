(NASDAQ: FDEF) announced today that earnings for the first quarter of 2018 were $11.7 million, or $1.15 per diluted common share compared to $5.1 million or $0.54 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter 2017 results included approximately one month of operations from Commercial Savings Bank and had no impact from Corporate One Benefits Agency Inc. (“Corporate One”). In comparison, the first quarter 2018 results include a full quarter of operations from both Commercial Savings Bank and Corporate One. The acquisitions of Commercial Bancshares, Inc. and its banking subsidiary Commercial Savings Bank (collectively “CSB”) and Corporate One were completed on February 24, 2017, and April 1, 2017, respectively.\nThe results for the first quarter 2018 also include a credit loan loss provision of $1.1 million, which had an after tax benefit of $865,000, or $0.08 per diluted share, which more than offset expenses for OREO write-downs of $544,000, with an after tax impact of $430,000, or $0.04 per diluted share and non-executive employee bonuses of $300,000, which had an after tax impact of $237,000, or $0.02 per diluted share. The first quarter 2017 results included merger and conversion expenses related to the CSB transaction of $3.6 million, which had an after tax impact of $2.5 million, or $0.27 per diluted share. In addition, the first quarter 2017 results reflected the impact of the purchase of a bank owned life insurance policy which included a tax-free value enhancement gain of $1.5 million and the surrender of a bank owned life insurance policy which added $1.7 million to income tax expense, which together reduced net income approximately $200,000, or $0.02 per diluted share.\n“We are very pleased to reach the $3.0 billion milestone in total assets at quarter-end,” said Donald P. Hileman, President and Chief Executive Officer of First Defiance Financial Corp. “We have come a long way from a year ago by delivering on our acquisitions, executing our organic growth strategies, and improving our profitability metrics, which were further enhanced by the benefit from tax reform. We remain very positive that we can build upon this progress in 2018 and beyond.”\nNet interest income up compared to first quarter 2017\nNet interest income of $25.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 was up from $21.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase over the prior year’s first quarter was attributable to a full quarter of added operations from the CSB merger, organic growth and net interest margin expansion. Net interest margin was 3.95% for the first quarter of 2018, up from 3.88% in the fourth quarter of 2017, and up from 3.81% in the first quarter of 2017. Yield on interest earning assets increased to 4.43% in the first quarter of 2018, up 21 basis points from 4.22% in the first quarter of 2017. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 11 basis points in the first quarter of 2018 to 0.65% from 0.54% in the first quarter of 2017.\n“Our net interest margin improved in the first quarter and continues to perform well in the rising interest rate environment,” said Hileman. “While organic loan and deposit growth was seasonally down from last quarter, success in our growth strategies is evident with our 18.7% increase in net interest income from a year ago. We feel confident that this performance will continue as we are well positioned for future rate movements.”\nNon-interest income up from first quarter 2017\nFirst Defiance’s non-interest income in the first quarter of 2018 was $10.7 million compared with $10.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter 2017 included a $1.5 million enhancement value gain related to the purchase of bank owned life insurance. Excluding the 2017 enhancement value gain, non-interest income increased $1.7 million primarily due to the inclusion of operations from the CSB and Corporate One mergers completed in 2017.\nMortgage banking income remained flat at $1.7 million in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017. Gains from the sale of mortgage loans also remained consistent at $1.1 million in the first quarters of 2018 and 2017. Mortgage loan servicing revenue was $944,000 in the first quarter of 2018, up slightly from $934,000 in the first quarter of 2017. First Defiance had a positive change in the valuation adjustment in mortgage servicing assets of $37,000 in the first quarter of 2018 compared with a positive adjustment of $33,000 in the first quarter of 2017.\nFor the first quarter 2018, service fees and other charges were $3.1 million, up from $2.8 million in the first quarter of 2017; and commissions from the sale of insurance products were $4.3 million, up from $3.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter typically includes contingent revenues, bonuses paid by insurance carriers when the Company achieves certain loss ratios or growth targets. In the first quarter of 2018, First Defiance’s insurance subsidiary, First Insurance Group, earned $1.0 million of contingent income, compared to $1.2 million during the first quarter of 2017. Trust income was $552,000 in the first quarter of 2018, up from $450,000 in the first quarter of 2017.\n“Non-interest income continues to bolster our overall revenue growth with solid core growth in all of our major business lines with additional contributions from our acquisitions,” said Hileman.\nNon-interest expenses up from first quarter 2017\nTotal non-interest expense was $23.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, up from $23.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter 2017 included expenses of $3.6 million related to the CSB merger and conversion. Excluding the 2017 merger and conversion expenses, the increase in non-interest expenses was $3.7 million, mostly due to the additional expenses from the operations of CSB and Corporate One mergers completed in 2017. Compensation and benefits decreased to $13.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $14.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in compensation and benefits from a year ago is mainly due to the prior year period including $2.8 million of merger costs to settle employment and benefit agreements, while the current year period includes a full quarter of personnel expenses for the acquired CSB and Corporate One locations. Data processing cost was $2.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, up from $1.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. Other non-interest expense of $4.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 increased from $4.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Other expenses in the first quarter 2018 include OREO write-downs of $544,000, while the first quarter 2017 included $667,000 of CSB merger and conversion related costs.\nCredit quality\nNon-performing loans totaled $27.9 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease from $30.7 million at December 31, 2017, but an increase from $15.1 million at March 31, 2017. The decrease from the prior quarter-end was due to the payoff of a large relationship previously downgraded in the second quarter of 2017. In addition, First Defiance had $1.4 million of OREO at March 31, 2018, compared to $705,000 at March 31, 2017. Accruing troubled debt restructured loans were $13.7 million at March 31, 2018, compared with $9.8 million at March 31, 2017.\nThe non-performing loan payoff resulted in a principal recovery of $1.7 million. As a result, the first quarter 2018 performance reflected net loan recoveries of $1.7 million and a credit provision for loan losses of $1.1 million compared with net loan charge-offs of $190,000 and a provision for loan loss expense of $55,000 for the same period in 2017.\nThe allowance for loan loss as a percentage of total loans was 1.16% at March 31, 2018, compared with 1.15% at March 31, 2017. In addition, the CSB loans acquired in 2017 were recorded at fair value with purchase accounting adjustment discounting the loan balance instead of an allowance for loan losses. For the CSB loans acquired the discount recorded totaled $3.7 million, or 1.9% of total CSB loans at March 31, 2018.\n“Overall asset quality metrics improved from last quarter, with all non-performing asset categories declining and all allowance coverage ratios improving,” said Hileman. “Significant recoveries totaling $2.0 million contributed to both higher earnings and strengthened reserves this quarter.”\nTotal assets at $3.02 billion\nTotal assets at March 31, 2018, were $3.02 billion compared to $2.99 billion at December 31, 2017, and $2.93 billion at March 31, 2017.\nNet loans receivable (excluding loans held for sale) were $2.33 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $2.32 billion at December 31, 2017, and $2.21 billion at March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, net loans receivable grew $118.8 million, or 5.4% from a year ago.\nAlso, at March 31, 2018, goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $103.9 million compared to $104.3 million at December 31, 2017, and $97.1 million at March 31, 2017.\nTotal deposits at March 31, 2018, were $2.49 billion compared with $2.44 billion at December 31, 2017, and $2.37 billion at March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, total deposits grew $118.0 million, or 5.0% from a year ago.\nTotal stockholders’ equity was $379.2 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $373.3 million at December 31, 2017, and $354.2 million at March 31, 2017.\nDividend to be paid May 25\nThe Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.30 per common share payable May 25, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 18, 2018. The dividend represents an annual dividend of 2.09 percent based on the First Defiance common stock closing price on April 13, 2018. First Defiance has approximately 10,182,649 common shares outstanding.\nChairman William J. Small Announces Planned Retirement\nFirst Defiance Financial Corp. Chairman William J.
