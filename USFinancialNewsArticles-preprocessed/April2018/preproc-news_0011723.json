Since leaving Aetna in 2017, Carl has served as a NueHealth Holdings Advisory Board member, a consultant and an investor in several privately held healthcare companies.\nMr. King spent the last 22 years in a variety of senior executive roles with Aetna. As President of National Accounts, he was responsible for a $9 billion business unit serving Aetna's largest customers. While serving as Head of National Networks and Contracting Services for Aetna, Carl had nationwide responsibility for network strategy, high-performance networks, value-based contracting and fraud prevention. He also led the integration of Aetna and Coventry's provider networks.\nMr. King served as CEO of Health Alliance Medical Plans, an innovative provider-sponsored health plan based in Illinois. He started out in the hospital business running hospitals for Hospital Affiliates and Hospital Corporation of America. He also worked for Carle Clinic in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois.\nCarl earned his B.B.A. degree in Health Administration from Georgia State University, where he ranked #1 in his graduating class.

Tasset, Chairman of Nueterra Capital said, \"The addition of these three individuals combined with our current leadership gives us an executive team unrivaled in the industry. With the likes of Berkshire Hathaway, Amazon and JP Morgan entering the healthcare space, it is important that we have world-class management that can exceed their expectations of transforming Healthcare. We are excited about the addition of these three proven executives and our ability to deliver on the promise of Healthcare consumerism and value=based payment reform.\"\nNueHealth Holdings\nNueHealth Holdings is a privately held, nationally trusted healthcare partner with more than 10,000 physicians and 25 health systems, delivering approximately $828 million of consolidated revenue annually in 28 states.
