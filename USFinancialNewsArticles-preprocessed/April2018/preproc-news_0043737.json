Mexico's Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo speaks during an entrepreneurship event in Mexico City, Mexico February 21, 2018. REUTERS/Ginnette Riquelme \nThe EU and Mexico have been negotiating an update to a trade deal agreed 21 years ago that largely covers industrial goods. They had wanted to add farm products, more services, investment and government procurement, and include provisions on labour standards and environmental protection. \n“After several months of intense negotiations, this afternoon we reached an agreement in principle on trade and investment between the European Union and Mexico,” European Commissioners Cecilia Malmstrom and Phil Hogan and Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said in a statement. \nThe statement did not give details of what had been agreed.
