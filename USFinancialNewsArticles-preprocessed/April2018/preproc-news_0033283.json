Follow us on Twitter at @WSJRisk. \nVisitors pass ZTE booth at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February. REUTERS/Sergio Perez/File Photo Good morning. The export ban imposed by the U.S. on China-based telecommunications company ZTE Corp. should serve as a lesson to other businesses about what happens when a company lies to the U.S. government.\nThe U.S. Commerce Department stung ZTE with a seven-year ban this week after it accused the company of making false statements since striking a $1.19 billion settlement last year over export-controls and sanctions violations. “Law enforcement hates nothing more than being lied to,” Douglas Jacobson, a partner at the international trade-focused firm Jacobson Burton Kelley PLLC, told Risk & Compliance Journal’s Samuel Rubenfeld . The firm represents companies that import products from, and export components to, ZTE.\nCompanies that ignore U.S. law put their access to U.S. technology and markets at risk, said Daniel Glaser, principal at the Financial Integrity Network, a consultancy that advises governments and companies on illicit finance threats. “Firms facing enforcement actions need to be fully forthcoming with U.S. officials and follow through on their commitments to the U.S. government, both in letter and spirit,” said Mr. Glaser.\nZTE retained and paid full bonuses to employees it was supposed to discipline for the violations; the government only learned about it after the Commerce Department requested documents verifying the action, the U.S. alleged.\nThe Chinese company halted trading on Tuesday following the allegations. It said in a brief statement it “is assessing the full range of potential implications” of the U.S. order and is communicating with relevant parties over how to respond. ZTE relies on U.S. components for its products.\nZTE established a crisis-management team, the company’s chairman said in a memo seen by the South China Morning Post. In it, he appealed for calm from the company’s 80,000 workers. “The company is actively communicating and giving its all to resolve this crisis,” said Chairman Yin Yimin in the memo.\nThe U.S. allegations sent the stock prices of optical-component firms sliding and placed American companies in the crossfire .\nEXCLUSIVE ON RISK AND COMPLIANCE JOURNAL \nU.S. bars second Albanian official. The State Department blocked a former Albanian member of parliament from coming into the U.S., making him the second official from that country to be denied access under an anti-corruption law this year.\nCOMPLIANCE \nGermans push for a break on sanctions. German leaders want the U.S. to exempt their country’s companies from new sanctions on Russia. In a visit to Washington this week, Germany’s finance minister will push for special treatment and Chancellor Angela Merkel plans to raise the issue with President Donald Trump this month. Many German firms do substantial business in Russia, the WSJ reports.\nA worker walks in front of pipes at the Nord Stream 2 facility in Sassnitz, Germany.

The Senate on Tuesday voted to proceed with legislation to overturn 2013 guidance on lending at auto dealerships. A final vote is expected Wednesday, and the House is expected to approve its version of the legislation shortly thereafter.\nU.S. proposes quota changes on drugs. The Trump administration proposed changing federal rules to say that officials must consider how badly a drug is being abused in setting quotas for the production of the medication. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the action would help address the nation’s opioid problem, the WSJ reports.\nNew York pushes crypto exchanges on transparency.

Facebook this week will start asking European users for permission to use their data for features like facial recognition and some forms of targeted advertising, the WSJ reports. Facebook said it would allow users in the rest of the world to review those details in coming months. The firm is seeking to allay concerns over how it handles personal information.\nREPUTATION \nSouthwest starts accident probe. Southwest Airlines said it is accelerating inspections of some engines following a failure on a flight between New York and Dallas.

Starbucks will close thousands of stores on a May afternoon to conduct antibias employee education.

The coffee chain’s CEO has apologized for the incident, the WSJ reports.\nRISK \nSeoul sees path for formal end to Korean War. A South Korean official said Seoul could push for a more permanent peace agreement on the Korean Peninsula to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War. The news comes as the North and South formalize the agenda for a meeting between their leaders this month, the WSJ reports.\nPompeo met with Kim Jong Un. President Donald Trump sent Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang over Easter.
