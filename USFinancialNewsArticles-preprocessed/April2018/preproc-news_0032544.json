    "text": "ATHENS, April 17 (Reuters) - Hellenic Petroleum Chairman Efstathios Tsotsoros has taken on the additional position of chief executive, the company said in a bourse filing.\nTsotsorosâ€™ appointment was proposed by the Greek state last week and approved at a board meeting on Tuesday. Grigoris Stergioulis steps down after three years at the helm.\nGreece is selling a stake in Hellenic, its biggest oil refiner, under its latest bailout programme.\nIts major shareholders, Greece and Paneuropean Oil and Industrial Holdings, have agreed to divest a combined stake of at least 50.1 percent in the refiner through an international tender.
