    "text": "-- First quarter 2018 results included EPS of $0.36, up 38.5% from one year prior, along with record quarterly average loan balances, net interest income, revenue and pre-tax income --\nPITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TriState Capital Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSC) reported record first quarter earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2018. All-time-high quarterly average loan balances resulted in record net interest income which, coupled with continued improvement in operating efficiency, led to record pre-tax income.\nTriState Capital’s first quarter diluted earnings per share (EPS) were $0.36, up 38.5% from $0.26 one year prior. The company reported EPS of $0.42 in the fourth quarter of last year, which included an $0.08 one-time benefit from federal tax legislation enacted in December 2017. Excluding the one-time tax benefit in 2017, first quarter 2018 EPS grew 5.8% from the linked quarter. Net income for the parent company of TriState Capital Bank and Chartwell Investment Partners was $10.4 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $7.5 million in the year-ago period and $12.0 million in the fourth quarter of last year, which included the impact of a $2.4 million one-time tax benefit.\n“TriState Capital delivered exceptional results in the first three months of 2018, with earnings growth of more than 38%, year-over-year, resulting in a first-quarter record,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer James F. Getz said. “We are very pleased with our ability to deliver consistent year-over-year double-digit EPS growth for 13 quarters running, even as we continue to invest in the future of this company. Our private and commercial banking businesses are rapidly growing existing and new relationships which we expect to drive continued loan and deposit growth in the coming quarters, on top of the more than 20%, year-over-year, organic growth achieved this quarter. Our investment management business continues to benefit from our expanding distribution network and has grown total assets under management to more than $9 billion, through a combination of organic and acquired growth. Our expectations for a strong 2018 are further bolstered by the successful completion of a $40 million preferred stock offering during the first quarter, providing us with ample capital to fuel TriState Capital’s continued growth.”\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 HIGHLIGHTS\nPre-tax income grew to a record $13.3 million, increasing 21.8% from the year-ago period and 3.3% from the linked quarter Net interest income grew to a record $26.3 million, up 25.6% from the year-ago period and 5.9% from the linked quarter, reflecting an increase in average loans of 20.8% from the year-ago period and 4.5% from the linked quarter Total loans grew to a record $4.30 billion at period end, up 21.6% from March 31, 2017 and 2.8% during the quarter Total deposits grew to a record $4.10 billion at period end, up 23.5% from March 31, 2017 and 2.8% during the quarter Chartwell assets under management rose to more than $9 billion following the acquisition of $1.06 billion of institutional client assets from Columbia Partners in April 2018\nREVENUE GROWTH\nTriState Capital’s record total revenue of $37.3 million in the first quarter 2018 grew 15.5% from $32.3 million in the same period last year and 1.3% from $36.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet interest income (NII) for the first quarter 2018 grew $5.3 million, or 25.6%, year-over-year to a record $26.3 million. Compared to the linked fourth quarter of 2017, NII increased by $1.5 million, or 5.9%, from $24.8 million. Net interest margin grew to 2.35% in the first quarter of 2018, increasing by 11 basis points from the year-ago quarter and 9 basis points from the linked quarter, resulting from loan yield expansion and lower-cost deposits gathered through TriState Capital’s liquidity and treasury management products and services.\nNon-interest income totaled $11.1 million in the first quarter 2018, compared to $11.4 million in the first quarter of last year and $12.1 million in the linked quarter. TriState Capital’s non-interest income is largely made up of Chartwell investment management fees, which totaled $8.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $9.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 and $9.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Other non-interest income was $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $2.1 million in the year-ago quarter and $2.7 million in the linked quarter, primarily reflecting borrower-facing interest rate swap activity.\nOPERATING EFFICIENCY\nNon-interest expenses in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $23.9 million, or an annualized 2.03% of average assets, compared to $21.2 million, or 2.15%, in the year-ago period and $25.7 million, or 2.24%, in the fourth quarter of 2017. The bank’s efficiency ratio for the first quarter of 2018 improved to 54.48%, down 351 basis points from 57.99% in the year-ago quarter and 694 basis points from 61.42% in the linked quarter.\nThe company’s effective tax rate was 21.8% in the first quarter and is expected to be approximately 21% to 22% for the year ending December 31, 2018.\nBALANCE SHEET GROWTH\nAverage loans totaled a record $4.17 billion in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting organic growth of 20.8% from $3.45 billion in the same period last year and 4.5% from $3.98 billion in the linked quarter.\nLoans totaled $4.30 billion at March 31, 2018, growing organically by $765.7 million, or 21.6%, from balances at March 31, 2017 and $118.5 million, or 2.8%, from December 31. Private banking loans of $2.34 billion at March 31, 2018 increased by $504.8 million, or 27.5%, from one year prior and $76.3 million, or 3.4%, from the end of the linked quarter. Commercial loans totaled $1.96 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $260.9 million, or 15.3%, from the end of the year-ago quarter and $42.2 million, or 2.2%, from the end of the linked quarter.\nTotal deposits of $4.10 billion at March 31, 2018 reflect growth of $781.1 million, or 23.5%, from March 31, 2017 and $111.3 million, or 2.8%, from the linked quarter.\nTriState Capital continues to manage an asset-sensitive balance sheet. At March 31, 2018, 91% of the company’s loan portfolio was floating rate and 23% of deposits were fixed-rate certificates of deposit.\nASSET QUALITY\nTriState Capital’s strong asset quality metrics saw further improvement in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting the company’s disciplined credit culture and the expansion of its private banking non-purpose margin loans secured by marketable securities. Private banking loans comprised 54.4% of the total loan portfolio at March 31, 2018, while commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans comprised 29.7% and 15.9% of total loans, respectively.\nNon-performing assets (NPAs) declined to $6.1 million, or 0.12% of total assets, at March 31, 2018, compared to $18.2 million, or 0.45%, at March 31, 2017 and $6.8 million, or 0.14%, at December 31, 2017.\nNon-performing Loans (NPLs) declined to $2.5 million, or 0.06% of total loans, at March 31, 2018, compared to $14.1 million, or 0.40%, at March 31, 2017 and $3.2 million, or 0.08%, December 31, 2017.\nAdverse-rated credits declined to $29.0 million, or 0.67% of total loans, at March 31, 2018, compared to $40.0 million, or 1.13%, at March 31, 2017 and $29.9 million, or 0.71%, at December 31, 2017.\nThe company recorded net recoveries of $206,000 in the first quarter of 2018, compared to net charge-offs of $2.8 million, or 0.33% of average total loans, in the year-ago quarter and net recoveries of $103,000 in the linked quarter.\nTriState Capital’s provision for loan loss expense of $195,000 in the first quarter of 2018 reflected net recoveries and declining NPLs and adverse rated credits. TriState Capital recorded provision expense of $243,000 in the first quarter of 2017 and a credit to provision of $1.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe company’s allowance for loan losses (ALL) represented 0.34% of total loans at March 31, 2018, compared to 0.46% at March 31, 2017 and 0.34% at December 31, 2017, reflecting its declining NPLs as well as the lower levels of provision required by the low risk profile of the bank’s growing proportion of private banking loans in its portfolio.\nINVESTMENT MANAGEMENT\nOn April 6, 2018, the company closed its previously announced acquisition of approximately $1.06 billion of client assets under management (AUM) from Columbia Partners, L.L.C., bringing Chartwell Investment Partners’ total AUM to more than $9 billion. As part of the acquisition, the company acquired institutional client accounts with a mix of high-grade fixed income and large-cap equity assets, which generate annualized revenue of more than $2 million, as well as a team of three experienced professionals. TriState Capital believes the all-cash transaction will be minimally accretive to 2018 earnings per share and does not expect material acquisition-related expenses from the deal.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Chartwell grew total AUM to $8.34 billion, increasing 1.9% from $8.19 billion one year prior and 0.4% from $8.31 billion at December 31, 2017. Chartwell reported new business and new flows from existing accounts of $411 million in the first quarter of 2018, which more than offset outflows of $316 million and market depreciation of $60 million. Chartwell’s weighted average fee rate was 0.44% at March 31, 2018. Investment management fees of $8.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $9.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 and $9.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Including AUM acquired from Columbia Partners, pro forma Chartwell investment management fees would have been approximately $9.5 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nMARCH 2018 CAPITAL RAISE\nIn March 2018, TriState Capital Holdings completed a public offering of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, raising $40.3 million, or approximately $38.4 million net of underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses. TriState Capital Holdings contributed $25 million of the net proceeds to its TriState Capital Bank subsidiary to support its continued growth. The preferred stock is treated as tier 1 capital for regulatory capital purposes.\nCAPITAL STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY\nAs of March 31, 2018, TriState Capital Holdings reported ratios of 12.84% for total risk-based capital, 12.25% for tier 1 risk-based capital, 11.09% for common equity tier 1 risk-based capital, and 7.96% for tier 1 leverage.\nIn January 2018, TriState Capital’s Board of Directors approved share repurchases of up to $5 million, which may be made at the discretion of management from time to time, of which $4.4 million remains available. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the company repurchased a total of 24,200 shares for approximately $575,000 at an average cost of $23.78 per share.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nAs previously announced, TriState Capital will hold a conference call tomorrow to review its financial results and operating performance.\nThe live conference call on April 19 will be held at 8:30 a.m. ET.

These non-GAAP financial measures are “tangible common equity,” “tangible book value per common share,” “EBITDA,” “adjusted EBITDA,” “total revenue,” and “efficiency ratio.” Although we believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide a greater understanding of our business, these measures are not necessarily comparable to similar measures that may be presented by other companies.\n“Tangible common equity” is defined as common shareholders’ equity reduced by intangible assets, including goodwill. We believe this measure is important to management and investors to better understand and assess changes from period to period in common shareholders’ equity exclusive of changes in intangible assets. Goodwill, an intangible asset that is recorded in a business purchase combination, has the effect of increasing both equity and assets, while not increasing our tangible equity or tangible assets.\n“Tangible book value per common share” is defined as common shareholders’ equity reduced by intangible assets, including goodwill, divided by common shares outstanding. We believe this measure is important to many investors who are interested in changes from period to period in book value per share exclusive of changes in intangible assets.\n“EBITDA” and “Adjusted EBITDA” are defined as net income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and intangible amortization expenses, adjusted for acquisition related items. We use adjusted EBITDA particularly to assess the strength of our investment management business. We believe this measure is important because it allows management and investors to better assess our investment management performance in relation to our core operating earnings, excluding certain non-cash items and the volatility that is associated with certain one-time items and other discrete items that are unrelated to our core business.\n“Total revenue” is defined as net interest income and non-interest income, excluding gains and losses on the sale and call of investment securities. We believe adjustments made to our operating revenue allow management and investors to better assess our operating revenue by removing the volatility that is associated with certain other items that are unrelated to our core business.\n“Efficiency ratio” is defined as non-interest expense, excluding acquisition related items and intangible amortization expense, where applicable, divided by our total revenue. We believe this measure, particularly at the Bank, allows management and investors to better assess our operating expenses in relation to our core operating revenue by removing the volatility that is associated with certain one-time items and other discrete items that are unrelated to our core business.\nTRISTATE CAPITAL HOLDINGS, INC.
