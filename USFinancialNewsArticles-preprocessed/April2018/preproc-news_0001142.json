(NASDAQ: INTX) today announced financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\n“I am very pleased with the fourth quarter 2017 results, posting an increase in total revenue compared to the third quarter, generating consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes of $1.3 million after six consecutive loss quarters, and reporting adjusted EBITDA of $4.0 million, which is the highest of the last eight quarters,” said Michael R. Stanfield, Executive Chairman and President. “After navigating the shock to our business from the regulatory impact of the CFPB, and the disappointing results of our non-identity theft protection ventures, Intersections has effectively invested in and built new and innovative tools for the world of identity fraud and data theft.” Mr. Stanfield continued, “New marketing channels, an invigorated team, and the highest level of compromised data and identity crimes in history are creating a significant opportunity for success.”\nKey Accomplishments and Developments:\nThe Identity Guard ® with Watson™ technology platform and product suite was launched on June 26, 2017. During the fourth quarter, development activities were completed to expand the Identity Guard ® with Watson™ platform to offer consumers both an entry level service, Value, and a premium service, Premier, in addition to our Total service plan. All three tiers of service for Identity Guard ® with Watson™ include an option for a robust family coverage service. The Identity Guard ® with Watson™ product suite is now the Company’s primary offering. Successfully completed first business development campaign working with employers and their employee benefits advisors to make Identity Guard ® offerings available to employees across the U.S. New employer programs acquired were launched in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. As of December 31, 2017, contracts were in place with employers with approximately 170,000 eligible employees. Significantly advanced the transformation of sales and marketing capabilities by continuing to invest in in-house business development capabilities covering employee benefits, partner and breach channels as well as the client support team. The cumulative month’s experience with Intersections of the employee benefits sales team more than doubled from 40 months to over 100 months during 2017 and the distribution network was significantly expanded by establishing relationships with 15 national and over 125 regional/local employee benefits advisors and brokerages. The completion of the divestiture program in the third quarter of 2017 eliminated discontinued operations that used cash of $2.4 million and $17.2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nConsolidated Fourth Quarter and Year-to-Date Results:\nConsolidated revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $40.0 million, compared to $42.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $1.3 million, compared to $(1.2) million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $4.0 million, compared to $2.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Basic and diluted income (loss) from continuing operations per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $0.13, compared to $(0.06) for the quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nConsolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $159.6 million, compared to $175.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Loss from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $(13.7) million, compared to $(3.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $3.2 million, compared to $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Basic and diluted loss from continuing operations per share for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $(0.49), compared to $(0.15) for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nConsolidated Fourth Quarter Highlights:\nIdentity Guard ® subscriber revenue was $13.6 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $12.4 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 and $12.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The Identity Guard ® subscriber base was 359 thousand subscribers as of December 31, 2017, compared to 338 thousand subscribers as of September 30, 2017. The increase in the subscriber base was primarily from growth in the direct to consumer and employee benefits channels. Revenue from U.S. financial institution clients was $20.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to revenue of $20.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. Revenue decreased on average by 1.2% per month during the fourth quarter, which the Company believes is representative of normal attrition given the discontinuation of marketing and retention efforts for this population. Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $1.3 million, compared to $(3.0) million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, and $(1.2) million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $4.0 million, compared to $1.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 and $2.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The fourth quarter marked the third consecutive quarter of improvement in Adjusted EBITDA and the second consecutive quarter of positive Adjusted EBITDA.\nLiquidity:\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had a cash balance of $8.5 million, and an outstanding principal balance of $21.5 million under its new credit agreement, as amended. Cash (used in) operating activities of continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $(50) thousand. Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $1.8 million.\nThe Company began expanding its business development capabilities in 2016 to address market channel and distribution opportunities and continued the expansion of this team in 2017. As a result, cash used in operating activities for the year includes approximately $4.7 million for business development activities, the significant majority of which is personnel cost. The Company expects to continue its spending on business development activities at approximately the same level as 2017 for 2018.\nCash used in operating activities included $6.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 for deferred subscription and solicitation costs related to our direct-to-consumer marketing, including $595 thousand in the fourth quarter. The Company implemented changes beginning in the second quarter to reduce the cash marketing spending in this channel and expects the use of cash for this purpose to continue to decline into 2018.\nThe Company continued to develop new product features primarily for the Identity Guard ® with Watson ™ platform during the year ended December 31, 2017. As a result, the Company invested approximately $4.5 million in internally developed capitalized software for the year. The Company expects to continue its investments in product development at approximately the same level as 2017 for 2018.\nFor additional information, please see “Item 7.
