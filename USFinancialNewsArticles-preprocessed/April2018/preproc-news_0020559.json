    "text": "TORONTO, April 10 (Reuters) - The western Canadian province of Saskatchewan, home to some of the worldâ€™s largest potash and uranium reserves, said on Tuesday it would run a smaller deficit in the current fiscal year and maintained its commitment to balance the books in 2019-20 as it constrains spending growth and looks for revenues to rise.\nSaskatchewan, which has endured a slump in its resource revenues in recent years, projected a C$365 million deficit for 2018-19, which follows a forecast C$595 million deficit for the fiscal year that ended on March 31.
