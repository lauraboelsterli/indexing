    "text": "SANTIAGO, April 26 (Reuters) - The union of cabin workers for LAN Express, a subsidiary of the Chile-based LATAM Airlines group, said on Thursday it would unilaterally end a more than two-week strike that had led to the cancellation of 2,000 flights. The 1,000-member Cabin Crew Union of LAN Express, which had negotiated for more than two months with the airline, the regionÂ´s largest carrier, said early Thursday morning in a statement it would explain its rationale in a press conference later today.\nLATAM did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
