    "text": "Rookie Daniel Palka collected four hits and hit his first career homer as the Chicago White Sox rolled to an 8-0 victory over the host Kansas City Royals in the opener of a day-night doubleheader Saturday at Kauffman Stadium.\nPlaying in his third career game, Palka went 4-for-5 and scored three times as the White Sox won their third straight game and improved to 5-0 this season against the Royals.\nPalka singled in the second and scored on an RBI single by Leury Garcia. He singled in the fourth and scored on Yoan Moncada’s RBI infield single.\nAfter getting his first career double in the fifth, Palka hit a three-run homer in the seventh after nearly being removed for a pinch hitter.\nPalka became the first White Sox player with a four-hit game within his first three career games since Jim Busby had four singles and was 4-for-6 on May 4, 1950, at Yankee Stadium.\nYolmer Sanchez added a bases-clearing double while Matt Davidson collected three hits as the White Sox totaled 15 hits and went 5-for-9 with runners in scoring position.\nCarson Fulmer (2-1) allowed four hits in a career-high seven innings. He struck out three, walked three and threw a career-high 109 pitches.\nTrevor Oaks (0-1) made his major league debut and allowed five runs and 12 hits in five innings.\nAt 5-20, the Royals matched the worst 25-game start in team history, equaling the marks set by the 1992 and 2006 editions. The Royals also dropped their 10th straight home game and are one shy of the team record set in 2013.\nKansas City also dropped its fifth straight overall and was shut out for the first time.\nGarcia factored in Chicago’s first two runs and prevented Kansas City’s first run.\nHe made it 1-0 with a line single to left field in the second, reached on a bunt single in the fourth, avoided being forced at second on Moncada’s single to the hole in shortstop and scored on Sanchez’s triple.\nGarcia’s bunt single and Sanchez’s double occurred after Mike Moustakas was robbed of a homer by Garcia’s leaping catch in center field in the third.\nPalka made it 8-0 by lifting a 2-2 curveball from Burch Smith over the right-center field wall at an estimated distance of 427 feet.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
