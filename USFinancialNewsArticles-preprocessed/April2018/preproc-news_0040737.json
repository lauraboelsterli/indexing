    "text": "LONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - Britain said on Friday it would strongly support Zimbabwe’s re-entry to the Commonwealth after elections later this year.\n“The UK would strongly support Zimbabwe’s re-entry and a new Zimbabwe that is committed to political and economic reform that works for all its people,” the Foreign Office said.\nForeign Secretary Boris Johnson, speaking on the sidelines of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM), said July’s election will be a bellwether for the direction of a new Zimbabwe.\n“The Zimbabwe government must deliver the free and fair elections the people of Zimbabwe deserve and which it has promised,” he said.\nFormer president Robert Mugabe pulled Zimbabwe out of the Commonwealth in 2003 after he was criticised over disputed elections.
