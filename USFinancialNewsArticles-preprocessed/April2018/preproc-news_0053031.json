    "text": "Diversified Portfolio of High Quality Assets Continues to Drive Record Performance\nCALGARY, Alberta, April 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TransCanada Corporation (TSX:TRP) (NYSE:TRP) (TransCanada or the Company) today announced net income attributable to common shares for first quarter 2018 of $734 million or $0.83 per share compared to net income of $643 million or $0.74 per share for the same period in 2017. Comparable earnings for first quarter 2018 were $870 million or $0.98 per share compared to $698 million or $0.81 per share for the same period in 2017. TransCanada's Board of Directors also declared a quarterly dividend of $0.69 per common share for the quarter ending June 30, 2018, equivalent to $2.76 per common share on an annualized basis.\n\"During the first quarter of 2018 our diversified portfolio of high-quality energy infrastructure assets continued to perform very well,\" said Russ Girling, TransCanada's president and chief executive officer. \"Comparable earnings per share increased 21 per cent compared to the same period last year despite the sale of our U.S. Northeast power assets, reflecting the strong performance of our legacy assets and contributions from approximately $7 billion of growth projects that were placed into service over the last twelve months. These included expansions of our NGTL and Canadian Mainline systems in our Canadian natural gas pipelines business, the Gibraltar, Rayne XPress, Leach XPress and Cameron Access projects in our U.S. natural gas pipelines business and the Grand Rapids and Northern Courier liquids pipelines in Alberta.\"\n\"Looking forward, we continue to advance our $21 billion near-term capital program with approximately $11 billion of projects expected to enter service by the end of 2018. This program is expected to generate significant additional growth in earnings and cash flow and support annual dividend growth at the upper end of an eight to ten per cent range through 2020 and an additional eight to ten per cent in 2021,\" added Girling. \"We have invested approximately $7 billion into these projects to date and, despite recent significant changes to the MLP sector, are well positioned to fund the remainder through our strong and growing internally generated cash flow, along with a broad spectrum of financing levers including access to capital markets on compelling terms and potential portfolio management activities.\"\n\"In addition, we continue to advance more than $20 billion of medium to longer-term projects including Keystone XL, Coastal GasLink and the Bruce Power life extension program. At the same time, we expect to secure additional organic growth opportunities associated with our extensive and well-positioned North American footprint. Success in advancing these and other projects into construction and operation could extend our dividend growth outlook beyond 2021,\" concluded Girling.\nHighlights\n(All financial figures are unaudited and in Canadian dollars unless noted otherwise)\nFirst quarter 2018 financial results Net income attributable to common shares of $734 million or $0.83 per share Comparable earnings of $870 million or $0.98 per share Comparable earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $2.1 billion Net cash provided by operations of $1.4 billion Comparable funds generated from operations of $1.6 billion Comparable distributable cash flow of $1.4 billion or $1.64 per share reflecting only non-recoverable maintenance capital expenditures Declared a quarterly dividend of $0.69 per common share for the quarter ending June 30, 2018 Placed approximately $160 million of NGTL facilities in service to complete the 2017 Expansion Program as well as the approximate $100 million Sundre Crossover project Successfully completed open seasons for NGTL securing contracts for 620 MMcf/d of incremental firm receipt service and 1.5 Bcf/d of existing and expansion export delivery capacity. These facilities are expected to result in an expansion program of approximately $2.5 billion Filed an NGTL application with the NEB for approval of a negotiated settlement with customers for 2018 and 2019 Placed the US$1.6 billion Leach XPress and US$0.3 billion Cameron Access projects in service Received FERC approval for Great Lakes and Northern Border rate settlements FERC proposed changes related to a number of income tax matters with respect to pipeline ratemaking.\nNet income attributable to common shares increased by $91 million to $734 million or $0.83 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period last year. Net income per common share in first quarter 2018 includes the effect of common shares issued in 2017 and 2018 under our DRP and corporate ATM program. First quarter 2017 results included a $24 million after-tax charge for integration-related costs associated with the acquisition of Columbia, a $10 million after-tax charge for costs related to the monetization of our U.S. Northeast power generation business, a $7 million after-tax charge related to the maintenance of Keystone XL assets and a $7 million income tax recovery related to the realized loss on a third party sale of Keystone XL project assets. All of these specific items, as well as unrealized gains and losses from changes in risk management activities, are excluded from comparable earnings.\nComparable earnings for first quarter 2018 were $870 million or $0.98 per share compared to $698 million or $0.81 per share for the same period in 2017, an increase of $172 million or $0.17 per share. Comparable earnings per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 include the effect of common shares issued in 2017 and 2018 under our DRP and corporate ATM program. The increase in first quarter 2018 comparable earnings over the same period in 2017 was primarily due to the net effect of:\na higher contribution from Liquids Pipelines primarily due to earnings from intra-Alberta pipelines placed in service in the second half of 2017, higher volumes on the Keystone Pipeline System and increased earnings from liquids marketing activities a higher contribution from U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines mainly due to increased earnings from Columbia Gas and Columbia Gulf growth projects placed in service, additional contract sales on ANR and Great Lakes and amortization of net regulatory liabilities recognized as a result of U.S. Tax Reform lower income tax expense primarily due to lower rates as a result of U.S. Tax Reform and lower flow-through income taxes in Canadian rate-regulated pipelines a higher contribution from Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines mainly due to higher revenues higher interest income and other due to realized gains in 2018 compared to realized losses in 2017 on derivatives used to manage our net exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on U.S. dollar-denominated income lower earnings from U.S. Power mainly due to the monetization of U.S. Northeast power generation assets in second quarter 2017 and the continued wind down of our U.S. power marketing operations lower earnings from Bruce Power primarily due to lower volumes resulting from increased outage days higher interest expense as a result of long-term debt and junior subordinated notes issuances, net of maturities, partially offset by the repayment of the Columbia acquisition bridge facilities in June 2017.\nNotable recent developments include:\nCanadian Natural Gas Pipelines:\nNGTL System : On April 9, 2018, we announced that the Sundre Crossover project was placed in service. The approximate $100 million pipeline project increases NGTL capacity at our Alberta / B.C. Export Delivery Point by 245 TJ/d (228 MMcf/d), enhancing connectivity to key downstream markets in the Pacific Northwest and California.\nThe NGTL 2017 Expansion Program has also been completed with approximately $160 million of facilities placed in service since December 31, 2017, including the Northwest Mainline Loop-Boundary Lake pipeline on April 2, 2018. The 2017 Expansion Program added approximately 230 km (143 miles) of new pipeline along with additional compression facilities and increased the NGTL System capacity by approximately 535 TJ/d (500 MMcf/d).\nOn February 15, 2018, we announced the successful completion of an open season for 260 TJ/d (242 MMcf/d) of existing and 1.1 PJ/d (1.0 Bcf/d) of expansion export capacity at the Empress / McNeill Export Delivery Point, with the expansion service expected to commence in November 2020 and April 2021. The average awarded contract term for the expansion capacity was approximately 29 years. We also announced that we had separately secured contracts for 664 TJ/d (620 MMcf/d) of incremental firm receipt service beginning in April 2021. Together, the incremental receipt and export delivery contracts will drive a $2.4 billion expansion program, bringing NGTL's capital program to a total of $7.2 billion.\nOn March 20, 2018, we announced the successful completion of an open season for additional expansion capacity at the Empress / McNeill Export Delivery Point for service expected to commence in November 2021. The offering of 300 TJ/d (280 MMcf/d) was oversubscribed with an average awarded contract term of approximately 22 years. The facilities and capital requirements for the expansion are still being finalized and are currently anticipated to increase NGTL's capital program by a further approximate $120 million.\nOn March 23, 2018, we filed an application with the National Energy Board (NEB) for approval of a negotiated settlement with our customers and other interested parties on the annual costs required to operate the NGTL System for 2018 and 2019, along with final 2018 tolls and revised interim 2018 tolls. The settlement fixes return on equity (ROE) at 10.1 per cent on 40 per cent deemed equity. The NEB is reviewing comments from interested parties and we anticipate a decision on the application in second quarter 2018.\nU.S. Natural Gas Pipelines:\nLeach XPress: Leach XPress was placed in service on January 1, 2018. This Columbia Gas project transports approximately 1.6 PJ/d (1.5 Bcf/d) of Marcellus and Utica gas supply to delivery points along the system.\nCameron Access: Cameron Access was placed in service on March 13, 2018. This Columbia Gulf project is designed to transport approximately 0.9 PJ/d (0.8 Bcf/d) of gas supply to the Cameron LNG export terminal in Louisiana.\nMountaineer XPress and WB XPress: In first quarter 2018, estimated project costs of US$3.0 billion for Mountaineer XPress and US$0.9 billion for WB XPress increased by US$0.4 billion and US$0.1 billion, respectively. These increases primarily reflect the impact of delays of various regulatory approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and other agencies, increased contractor construction costs due to unusually high demand for construction resources in the region, and modifications to contractor work plans and resources to maintain our projected in-service dates.\nGreat Lakes and Northern Border Rate Settlements: In February 2018, FERC approved the 2017 Great Lakes Rate Settlement and the 2017 Northern Border Rate Settlement, both of which were uncontested.\nMexico Natural Gas Pipelines:\nTula and Villa de Reyes: We continue to work toward finalizing amending agreements for both of these pipelines with the Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE) to formalize the schedule and payments resulting from their respective force majeure events. The CFE has commenced payments on both pipelines in accordance with the TSAs.\nSur de Texas: Offshore construction is now approximately 80 per cent complete and the project continues to progress toward an anticipated in-service date of late 2018.\nLiquids Pipelines:\nKeystone XL: In December 2017, an appeal to Nebraska's Court of Appeals was filed by intervenors after the Nebraska Public Service Commission (PSC) issued an approval of an alternative route for the Keystone XL project in November 2017. On March 14, 2018, the Nebraska Supreme Court, on its own motion, agreed to bypass the Court of Appeals and hear the appeal case against the PSC's alternative route itself. We expect the Nebraska Supreme Court, as the final arbiter, could reach a decision by late 2018 or first quarter 2019.\nThe Keystone XL Presidential Permit, issued in March 2017, has been challenged in two separate lawsuits commenced in Montana. Together with the U.S. Department of Justice, we are actively participating in these lawsuits to defend both the issuance of the permit and the exhaustive environmental assessments that support the U.S. President’s actions. Legal arguments addressing the merits of these lawsuits are scheduled to be heard in late May 2018 and we believe the court’s decisions may be issued by year-end 2018.\nThe South Dakota Public Utilities Commission permit for the Keystone XL project was issued in June 2010 and recertified in January 2016. An appeal of that recertification was denied in June 2017 and that decision has been further appealed to the South Dakota Supreme Court. On April 6, 2018, the Supreme Court directed the parties to address whether the Court lacks jurisdiction under the governing statute to consider the appeal. Legal arguments are scheduled for April 2018. A decision from the Supreme Court is expected in second or third quarter 2018. White Spruce: In February 2018, the Alberta Energy Regulator issued a permit for the construction of the White Spruce pipeline. Construction has commenced with an anticipated in-service date in second quarter 2019.\nEnergy:\nMonetization of U.S. Northeast power business: On March 1, 2018, as part of the continued wind down of our U.S. power marketing operations, we closed the sale of our U.S. power retail contracts for proceeds of approximately US$23 million and recognized income of US$10 million (US$7 million after tax).\nCorporate:\nCommon Share Dividend: Our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.69 per share for the quarter ending June 30, 2018 on TransCanada's outstanding common shares. The quarterly amount is equivalent to $2.76 per common share on an annualized basis.\nDividend Reinvestment Plan (DRP): In first quarter 2018, the participation rate in our DRP was approximately 38 per cent of common share dividends, resulting in $234 million reinvested in common equity under the program.\nATM Equity Issuance Program: In first quarter 2018, 5.8 million common shares were issued through the corporate ATM program at an average price of $56.51 per common share for gross proceeds of $329 million. An additional 1.6 million common shares were issued in April 2018, bringing year-to-date gross proceeds to $415 million at an average price of $55.64 per common share.\nU.S. Tax Reform and 2018 FERC Actions: In December 2016, FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) seeking comment on how to address the issue of whether its existing policies resulted in a ‘double recovery’ of income taxes in a pass-through entity such as a master limited partnership (MLP). The NOI was in response to a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in July 2016, in United Airlines, Inc., et al. v. FERC , directing FERC to address the issue.\nOn December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. Tax Reform), was signed resulting in significant changes to U.S. tax law including a decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 per cent to 21 per cent effective January 1, 2018. As a result of this change, deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities related to our U.S. businesses, including amounts related to our proportionate share of assets held in TC PipeLines, LP, were remeasured, as at December 31, 2017, to reflect the new lower income tax rate.\nOn March 15, 2018, FERC issued (1) a revised Policy Statement to address the treatment of income taxes for ratemaking purposes for MLPs; (2) a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing interstate pipelines file a one-time report to quantify the impact of the federal income tax rate reduction and the impact of the revised Policy Statement on each pipeline's ROE assuming a single-issue adjustment to a pipeline’s rates; and (3) a NOI seeking comment on how FERC should address changes related to accumulated deferred income taxes and bonus depreciation (collectively, the 2018 FERC Actions).\nFor more information on these developments and their implications for TransCanada and TC PipeLines, LP, please refer to our management's discussion and analysis.\nTeleconference and Webcast:\nWe will hold a teleconference and webcast on Friday, April 27, 2018 to discuss our first quarter 2018 financial results.

Capitalized and abbreviated terms that are used but not otherwise defined herein are identified in our 2017 Annual Report. Certain comparative figures have been adjusted to reflect the current period’s presentation.\nFORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\nWe disclose forward-looking information to help current and potential investors understand management’s assessment of our future plans and financial outlook, and our future prospects overall.\nStatements that are forward-looking are based on certain assumptions and on what we know and expect today.

Except as otherwise described herein, these comparable measures are calculated on a consistent basis from period to period and are adjusted for specific items in each period, as applicable.\nOur decision not to adjust for a specific item is subjective and made after careful consideration. Specific items may include:\ncertain fair value adjustments relating to risk management activities income tax refunds and adjustments and changes to enacted tax rates gains or losses on sales of assets or assets held for sale legal, contractual and bankruptcy settlements impact of regulatory or arbitration decisions relating to prior year earnings restructuring costs impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, investments and other assets including certain ongoing maintenance and liquidation costs acquisition and integration costs.\nWe exclude the unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives used to reduce our exposure to certain financial and commodity price risks. These derivatives generally provide effective economic hedges, but do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting. As a result, the changes in fair value are recorded in net income. As these amounts do not accurately reflect the gains and losses that will be realized at settlement, we do not consider them reflective of our underlying operations.\nThe following table identifies our non-GAAP measures against their equivalent GAAP measures.\nComparable measure Original measure comparable earnings net income attributable to common shares comparable earnings per common share net income per common share comparable EBITDA segmented earnings comparable EBIT segmented earnings comparable funds generated from operations net cash provided by operations comparable distributable cash flow net cash provided by operations Comparable earnings and comparable earnings per common share\nComparable earnings represents earnings or loss attributable to common shareholders on a consolidated basis, adjusted for specific items. Comparable earnings is comprised of segmented earnings, interest expense, AFUDC, interest income and other, income taxes and non-controlling interests, adjusted for specific items. See the Consolidated results section for reconciliations to net income attributable to common shares and net income per common share.\nComparable EBIT and comparable EBITDA\nComparable EBIT represents segmented earnings, adjusted for specific items. We use comparable EBIT as a measure of our earnings from ongoing operations as it is a useful measure of our performance and an effective tool for evaluating trends in each segment. Comparable EBITDA is calculated the same way as comparable EBIT but excludes the non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization. See the Reconciliation of non-GAAP measures section for a reconciliation to segmented earnings.\nFunds generated from operations and comparable funds generated from operations\nFunds generated from operations reflects net cash provided by operations before changes in operating working capital. We believe it is a useful measure of our consolidated operating cash flow because it does not include fluctuations from working capital balances, which do not necessarily reflect underlying operations in the same period, and is used to provide a consistent measure of the cash generating performance of our assets. Comparable funds generated from operations is adjusted for the cash impact of specific items. See the Financial condition section for a reconciliation to net cash provided by operations.\nComparable distributable cash flow and comparable distributable cash flow per common share\nWe believe comparable distributable cash flow is a useful supplemental measure of performance that defines cash available to common shareholders before capital allocation. Comparable distributable cash flow is defined as comparable funds generated from operations less preferred share dividends, distributions to non-controlling interests and maintenance capital expenditures. Maintenance capital expenditures are expenditures incurred to maintain our operating capacity, asset integrity and reliability, and include amounts attributable to our proportionate share of maintenance capital expenditures on our equity investments.\nAlthough we deduct maintenance capital expenditures in determining comparable distributable cash flow, we have the ability to recover the majority of these costs in Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines, U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines and Liquids Pipelines. As such, our presentation of comparable distributable cash flow and comparable distributable cash flow per common share also illustrates the impact of excluding recoverable maintenance capital expenditures from their respective calculations.\nSee the Financial condition section for a reconciliation to net cash provided by operations.\nConsolidated results - first quarter 2018\nthree months ended\nMarch 31 (unaudited - millions of $, except per share amounts) 2018 2017 Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines 253 282 U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines 648 561 Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines 137 118 Liquids Pipelines 341 227 Energy 50 198 Corporate (81 ) (33 ) Total segmented earnings 1,348 1,353 Interest expense (527 ) (500 ) Allowance for funds used during construction 105 101 Interest income and other 63 20 Income before income taxes 989 974 Income tax expense (121 ) (200 ) Net income 868 774 Net income attributable to non-controlling interests (94 ) (90 ) Net income attributable to controlling interests 774 684 Preferred share dividends (40 ) (41 ) Net income attributable to common shares 734 643 Net income per common share - basic and diluted $ 0.83 $0.74 Net income attributable to common shares increased by $91 million or $0.09 per common share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.

The NOI was in response to a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in July 2016, in United Airlines, Inc., et al. v. FERC (the United case), directing FERC to address the issue.\nOn December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. Tax Reform), was signed resulting in significant changes to U.S. tax law including a decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 per cent to 21 per cent effective January 1, 2018. As a result of this change, deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities related to our U.S. businesses, including amounts related to our proportionate share of assets held in TC PipeLines, LP, were remeasured as at December 31, 2017 to reflect the new lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate.\nOn March 15, 2018, FERC issued (1) a revised Policy Statement to address the treatment of income taxes for ratemaking purposes for MLPs; (2) a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) proposing interstate pipelines file a one-time report to quantify the impact of the federal income tax rate reduction and the impact of the revised Policy Statement on each pipeline's return on equity (ROE) assuming a single-issue adjustment to a pipeline’s rates; and (3) a NOI seeking comment on how FERC should address changes related to accumulated deferred income taxes and bonus depreciation (collectively, the 2018 FERC Actions). Each is described below.\nFERC Revised Policy Statement on Treatment of Income Taxes in MLPs\nFERC changed its long-standing policy on the treatment of income tax amounts to be included in pipeline rates subject to cost of service rate regulation within a MLP. The Policy Statement no longer permits entities organized as MLPs to recover an income tax allowance in their cost of service rates.\nOn April 16, 2018, we filed a Request for Clarification and If Necessary Rehearing of the FERC Policy Statement addressing concerns over the lack of clarity around entities with non-MLP ownership structures, entities with shared ownership between a MLP and a corporation, as well as entities owned by MLPs that are, in turn, owned partially by corporations. We sought clarification or a rehearing on the basis that FERC erred in not assessing the propriety of income tax allowances for pipelines on a case-by-case basis; overturned applicable legal precedent expressly not affected by the United case; failed to consider the effects of its order on industry; and failed to exhibit reasoned decision making or to support its decision with substantial evidence on the record.\nNOPR on Tax Law Changes for Interstate Natural Gas Pipelines\nThe NOPR proposes a rule that would require interstate pipelines, in certain circumstances, to file a one-time report, called FERC Form No. 501-G, that quantifies the rate impact of U.S. Tax Reform on FERC-regulated pipelines and the revised Policy Statement on pipelines held by MLPs. In addition to filing the one-time report, each pipeline would have four options:\nmake a limited Natural Gas Act Section 4 filing to reduce its rates by the percentage reduction in its cost of service shown in its FERC Form No. 501-G commit to file either a pre-packaged uncontested rate settlement or a general Section 4 rate case if it believes that using the limited Section 4 option will not result in just and reasonable rates. If the pipeline commits to file either by December 31, 2018, FERC will not initiate a Natural Gas Act Section 5 investigation of its rates prior to that date file a statement explaining its rationale for why it does not believe the pipeline's rates must change file the one-time report without taking any other action. At that point, FERC would consider whether to initiate a Section 5 investigation of any pipeline that has not submitted a limited Section 4 rate reduction filing or committed to file a general Section 4 rate case.\nWe submitted comments on the NOPR on April 25, 2018. Following the public comment period, we expect FERC to issue final order(s) in the late summer or early fall of 2018. We are evaluating this NOPR and our next courses of action, however, we do not expect an immediate or a retroactive impact from the NOPR or the revised Policy Statement described above.\nNOI Regarding the Effect of U.S. Tax Reform on Commission-Jurisdictional Rates\nIn the NOI, FERC seeks comment on the effects of U.S. Tax Reform to determine additional action, if any, required by FERC related to accumulated deferred income taxes that were collected from shippers in anticipation of paying the Internal Revenue Service, but which no longer accurately reflect the future income tax liability. The NOI also seeks comment on the elimination of bonus depreciation for regulated natural gas pipelines and other effects of U.S. Tax Reform. We plan to submit comments in response to the NOI, which are due May 21, 2018.\nIMPACT OF 2018 FERC ACTIONS ON TRANSCANADA\nWe own our U.S. natural gas pipelines through a number of different ownership structures. If the 2018 FERC Actions are enacted as proposed, we do not anticipate that the earnings and cash flows from our directly-held U.S. natural gas pipelines, including ANR, Columbia Gas and Columbia Gulf, will be materially impacted by the revised Policy Statement as they are held through wholly-owned taxable corporations and a significant proportion of their revenues are earned under non-recourse rates. Columbia Gas is required under existing settlements to adjust certain of its recourse rates for the decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate enacted December 22, 2017, with the changes implemented January 1, 2018. As ANR, Columbia Gas and Columbia Gulf and other wholly-owned regulated assets undergo future rate proceedings, some of which may be accelerated by the NOPR issued in March 2018, future rates may be impacted prospectively as a result of U.S. Tax Reform, but the impact is expected to be substantially mitigated by lower corporate income tax rates. Therefore, the impact on earnings and cash flows resulting from the 2018 FERC Actions on our wholly-owned U.S. natural gas pipelines is expected to be limited.\nThe revised Policy Statement also makes reference to prohibiting an income tax allowance for liquids pipelines held in MLP structures. We do not expect an impact on our liquids pipelines in the U.S. as they are not held in MLP form.\nFinancing\nIn the absence of changes to the 2018 FERC Actions or the identification and implementation of appropriate mitigation measures, further drop downs of assets into TC PipeLines, LP are not considered to be a viable funding lever. In addition, the TC PipeLines, LP ATM program is not currently being utilized. It is uncertain whether these will be restored as competitive financing options in the future. We believe we have the financial capacity to fund our existing capital program through predictable and growing cash flow generated from operations, access to capital markets, including through our Corporate ATM program and our DRP, portfolio management, cash on hand and substantial committed credit facilities.\nImpact of 2018 FERC Actions on TC PipeLines, LP\nU.S. natural gas pipelines owned wholly or in part through TC PipeLines, LP are expected to be adversely impacted by the 2018 FERC Actions, if they are enacted as proposed, particularly as contemplated by the policy change prohibiting the recovery of an income tax allowance for pipelines held through MLPs. While approximately half of TC PipeLines, LP’s revenues, including those of equity investments, are earned under non-recourse rates, the remaining revenues under recourse rates are expected to decline as rate adjustments occur without a compensating offset on income taxes paid. Individual pipelines owned by TC PipeLines, LP do not currently have a requirement to file for new rates until 2022, however, that timing may be accelerated by the NOPR, except where moratoria exist. While a number of uncertainties exist with respect to the changes resulting from the 2018 FERC Actions, in the absence of mitigation, TC PipeLines, LP’s earnings, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. The impact in 2018 is expected to be limited, but as rate adjustments are enacted following proceedings with customers and the FERC, subsequent periods could be more significantly affected. As our ownership interest in TC PipeLines, LP is approximately 25 per cent, the impact of the 2018 FERC Actions related to TC PipeLines, LP is not expected to be significant to our consolidated earnings or cash flows.\nWe are closely monitoring these developments as they relate to TC PipeLines, LP in order to identify the strategy that best positions us for the long term. As noted above, we do not anticipate further asset drop downs into TC PipeLines, LP as they are not considered to be a viable funding alternative at this time.\nAdditional Considerations\nIn addition to the direct impacts of the 2018 FERC Actions, each individual pipeline will be separately evaluated, including all cost of service elements, to ensure rates are deemed to be just and reasonable. In situations where a pipeline is realizing a relatively higher or lower ROE than is viewed to be just and reasonable, there may be additional prospective adjustments to future rates. The impact to our earnings and cash flows as a result of these potential changes is not expected to be significant. As well, the impact of the 2018 FERC Actions on certain pipelines with shared ownership between corporations and MLPs, or under other ownership structures, remains unclear at this time, with FERC expected to address these in future proceedings. We are monitoring developments on this and will assess the impact as more information becomes available.\nImpairment Considerations\nWe review plant, property and equipment and equity investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstance indicate that it might be impaired. We can initially make this assessment based on qualitative factors. If we conclude that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, then an impairment test is not performed.\nUntil the proposed 2018 FERC Actions are finalized, implementation requirements are clarified, including the applicability to assets partially-owned by a MLP or held in non-MLP structures, and we and TC PipeLines, LP have fully evaluated our respective alternatives to minimize the impact of the 2018 FERC Actions, we believe that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of the reporting units is less than its respective carrying value. Therefore, a goodwill impairment test was not performed. Also, we have determined there is no indication that the carrying values of plant, property and equipment and equity investments potentially impacted by FERC's proposals are not recoverable. We will continue to monitor developments and assess our goodwill for impairment. We will also review our property, plant and equipment and equity investments for recoverability as new information becomes available.\nAt December 31, 2017, the estimated fair value of Great Lakes exceeded its carrying value by less than 10 per cent. There is a risk that the 2018 FERC Actions, once finalized, could result in a goodwill impairment charge. The goodwill balance for Great Lakes is US$573 million at March 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017 - US$573 million). There is also a risk that the goodwill balance of US$82 million at March 31, 2018 (December 31, 2017 - US$82 million) related to Tuscarora could be negatively impacted by the 2018 FERC Actions.\nU.S. Tax Reform\nPursuant to the enactment of U.S. Tax Reform, we recorded net regulatory liabilities and a corresponding reduction in net deferred income tax liabilities in the amount of $1,686 million at December 31, 2017 related to our U.S. natural gas pipelines subject to rate-regulated accounting (RRA). Such amounts remain provisional as our interpretation, assessment and presentation of the impact of U.S. Tax Reform may be further clarified with additional guidance from regulatory, tax and accounting authorities. Should additional guidance be provided by these authorities or other sources during the one-year measurement period permitted by the SEC, we will review the provisional amounts and adjust as appropriate. Other than the amortizations discussed below, no adjustments were made to these amounts during first quarter 2018. There may be prospective adjustments to regulatory liabilities related to natural gas pipelines subject to RRA once the 2018 FERC Actions are finalized and take effect.\nCommencing January 1, 2018, the regulatory liabilities are being amortized using the Reverse South Georgia methodology. Under this methodology, rate-regulated entities determine amortization based on their composite depreciation rate and immediately begin recording amortization. Amortization of the net regulatory liability in the amount of $9 million was recorded in first quarter 2018 and included in Revenues.\nCapital Program\nWe are developing quality projects under our capital program. These long-life infrastructure assets are supported by long-term commercial arrangements with creditworthy counterparties or regulated business models and are expected to generate significant growth in earnings and cash flow.\nOur capital program consists of approximately $21 billion of near-term projects and approximately $24 billion of commercially-supported medium to longer-term projects. Amounts presented exclude maintenance capital expenditures, capitalized interest and AFUDC.\nAll projects are subject to cost adjustments due to market conditions, route refinement, permitting conditions, scheduling and timing of regulatory permits.\nNear-term projects\nExpected in-service\nEstimated project\nCarrying value (unaudited - billions of $) date cost at March 31, 2018 Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines Canadian Mainline 2018-2021 0.2 — NGTL System 2018 0.6 0.4 2019 2.4 0.4 2020 1.7 0.1 2021+ 2.5 — U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines Columbia Gas Mountaineer XPress 2018 US 3.0 US 0.7 WB XPress 2018 US 0.9 US 0.5 Modernization II 2018-2020 US 1.1 US 0.2 Buckeye XPress 2020 US 0.2 — Columbia Gulf Gulf XPress 2018 US 0.6 US 0.3 Other 1 2018-2020 US 0.3 US 0.1 Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines Sur de Texas 2 2018 US 1.3 US 1.1 Villa de Reyes 2018 US 0.8 US 0.5 Tula 2019 US 0.7 US 0.5 Liquids Pipelines White Spruce 2019 0.2 — Energy Napanee 2018 1.3 1.1 Bruce Power – life extension 3 up to 2020 0.9 0.3 18.7 6.2 Foreign exchange impact on near-term projects 4 2.6 1.1 Total near-term projects (billions of Cdn$) 21.3 7.3 1 Reflects our proportionate share of costs related to Portland XPress and various expansion projects.\n2 Reflects our proportionate share.\n3 Reflects our proportionate share of the remaining capital costs that Bruce Power expects to incur on its life extension investment programs in advance of the Unit 6 major refurbishment outage which is expected to begin in 2020.\n4 Reflects U.S./Canada foreign exchange rate of 1.29 at March 31, 2018.\nMedium to longer-term projects\nThe medium to longer-term projects have greater uncertainty with respect to timing and estimated project costs. The expected in-service dates of these projects are post-2020, and costs provided in the schedule below reflect the most recent costs for each project as filed with the various regulatory authorities or otherwise determined. These projects are subject to approvals that include FID and/or complex regulatory processes, however, each project has commercial support except where noted.\nEstimated project\nCarrying value (unaudited - billions of $) cost at March 31, 2018 Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines Canadian west coast LNG-related projects Coastal GasLink 4.8 0.4 NGTL System – Merrick 1.9 — Liquids Pipelines Heartland and TC Terminals 1 0.9 0.1 Grand Rapids Phase 2 2 0.7 — Keystone XL 3 US 8.0 US 0.3 Keystone Hardisty Terminal 1,3 0.3 0.1 Energy Bruce Power – life extension 2 5.3 — 21.9 0.9 Foreign exchange impact on medium to longer-term projects 4 2.3 0.1 Total medium to longer-term projects (billions of Cdn$) 24.2 1.0 1 Regulatory approvals have been obtained, additional commercial support is being pursued.\n2 Reflects our proportionate share.\n3 Carrying value reflects amount remaining after impairment charge recorded in 2015, along with additional amounts capitalized from January 1, 2018.\n4 Reflects U.S./Canada foreign exchange rate of 1.29 at March 31, 2018.\nOutlook\nConsolidated comparable earnings\nOur overall comparable earnings outlook for 2018 has increased compared to what was included in the 2017 Annual Report primarily as a result of higher volumes on the Keystone Pipeline System and higher contribution from liquids marketing activities in first quarter 2018. We do not anticipate the 2018 FERC Actions will have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows in 2018. See the 2018 FERC Actions section for further information.\nConsolidated capital spending\nWe expect to spend approximately $10 billion in 2018 on growth projects, maintenance capital and contributions to equity investments for 2018. The increase in capital spending from the amount included in the 2017 Annual Report primarily reflects incremental spending required to complete construction of our near-term capital program in 2018, including Columbia Gas projects, as well as the capitalization of costs to further advance our medium to longer-term projects.\nCanadian Natural Gas Pipelines\nThe following is a reconciliation of comparable EBITDA and comparable EBIT (our non-GAAP measures) to segmented earnings (the equivalent GAAP measure).\nthree months ended\nMarch 31 (unaudited - millions of $) 2018 2017 NGTL System 271 230 Canadian Mainline 193 247 Other 1 30 27 Comparable EBITDA 494 504 Depreciation and amortization (241 ) (222 ) Comparable EBIT and segmented earnings 253 282 1 Includes results from Foothills, Ventures LP, Great Lakes Canada, our share of equity income from our investment in TQM, general and administrative and business development costs related to our Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines.\nCanadian Natural Gas Pipelines segmented earnings decreased by $29 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 and are equivalent to comparable EBIT.\nNet income and comparable EBITDA for our rate-regulated Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines are generally affected by our approved ROE, our investment base, our level of deemed common equity and incentive earnings or losses. Changes in depreciation, financial charges and income taxes also impact comparable EBITDA but do not have a significant impact on net income as they are almost entirely recovered in revenues on a flow-through basis.\nthree months ended March 31 NGTL System Canadian Mainline (unaudited - millions of $) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net Income 92 82 37 52 Average investment base 9,091 7,853 3,817 4,103 Net income for the NGTL System increased by $10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 mainly due to a higher average investment base reflecting continued expansion of the system. Pending a NEB decision on the 2018 and 2019 Revenue Requirement Settlement Application, NGTL System earnings reflect the last approved ROE of 10.1 per cent on 40 per cent deemed equity and no incentive earnings have been recorded in 2018.\nNet income for the Canadian Mainline decreased by $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily because no incentive earnings have been recorded in 2018 pending a NEB decision on the 2018 - 2020 Tolls Review. As directed by the NEB, the Canadian Mainline filed an application for approval of 2018 - 2020 tolls on December 18, 2017.\nDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\nDepreciation and amortization increased by $19 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 mainly due to facilities that were placed in service for the NGTL System.\nU.S. Natural Gas Pipelines\nThe following is a reconciliation of comparable EBITDA and comparable EBIT (our non-GAAP measures) to segmented earnings (the equivalent GAAP measure).\nthree months ended\nMarch 31 (unaudited - millions of US$, unless otherwise noted) 2018 2017 Columbia Gas 231 185 ANR 141 122 TC PipeLines, LP 1,2,3 39 32 Great Lakes 4 35 27 Midstream 30 23 Columbia Gulf 26 18 Other U.S. pipelines 3,5 15 28 Non-controlling interests 6 118 108 Comparable EBITDA 635 543 Depreciation and amortization (122 ) (112 ) Comparable EBIT 513 431 Foreign exchange impact 135 140 Comparable EBIT (Cdn$) 648 571 Specific items: Integration and acquisition related costs – Columbia — (10 ) Segmented earnings (Cdn$) 648 561 1 Results reflect our earnings from TC PipeLines, LP’s ownership interests in GTN, Great Lakes, Iroquois, Northern Border, Bison, PNGTS, North Baja and Tuscarora, as well as general and administrative costs related to TC PipeLines, LP.\n2 TC PipeLines, LP periodically conducts ATM equity issuances which decrease our ownership in TC PipeLines, LP. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, our ownership interest in TC PipeLines, LP ranged between 25.7 per cent and 25.5 per cent compared to a range of 26.8 per cent and 26.4 per cent for the same period in 2017.\n3 TC PipeLines, LP acquired 49.34 per cent of our 50 per cent interest in Iroquois and our remaining 11.81 per cent interest in PNGTS on June 1, 2017.\n4 Results reflect our 53.55 per cent direct interest in Great Lakes. The remaining 46.45 per cent is held by TC PipeLines, LP.\n5 Results reflect earnings from our direct ownership interests in Iroquois, Crossroads and PNGTS (until June 1, 2017) and our effective ownership in Millennium and Hardy Storage, as well as general and administrative and business development costs related to our U.S. natural gas pipelines.\n6 Results reflect earnings attributable to portions of TC PipeLines, LP, PNGTS (until June 1, 2017) and CPPL (until February 17, 2017) that we do not own.\nU.S. Natural Gas Pipelines segmented earnings increased by $87 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.\nSegmented earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2017 included a $10 million pre-tax charge for integration and acquisition related costs associated with the Columbia acquisition. This amount has been excluded from our calculation of comparable EBIT. As well, a weaker U.S. dollar had a negative impact on the Canadian dollar equivalent segmented earnings from our U.S. operations.\nEarnings from our U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines operations are generally affected by contracted volume levels, volumes delivered and the rates charged as well as by the cost of providing services. Columbia and ANR results are also affected by the contracting and pricing of their storage capacity and commodity sales. Transmission and storage revenues are generally higher in winter months due to increased seasonal demand for our services.\nComparable EBITDA for U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines increased by US$92 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. This was primarily the net effect of:\nincreased earnings from Columbia Gas and Columbia Gulf growth projects placed in service, additional contract sales on ANR and Great Lakes and favourable commodity prices in Midstream increased earnings due to the amortization of the net regulatory liability recognized in 2017 as a result of U.S. Tax Reform.\nDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\nDepreciation and amortization increased by US$10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 mainly due to projects placed in service on Columbia Gas.\nMexico Natural Gas Pipelines\nThe following is a reconciliation of comparable EBITDA and comparable EBIT (our non-GAAP measures) to segmented earnings (the equivalent GAAP measure).\nthree months ended\nMarch 31 (unaudited - millions of US$, unless otherwise noted) 2018 2017 Topolobampo 44 40 Tamazunchale 31 29 Mazatlán 20 16 Guadalajara 19 17 Sur de Texas 1 9 4 Other 4 — Comparable EBITDA 127 106 Depreciation and amortization (19 ) (17 ) Comparable EBIT 108 89 Foreign exchange impact 29 29 Comparable EBIT and segmented earnings (Cdn$) 137 118 1 Represents our 60 per cent equity interest.\nMexico Natural Gas Pipelines segmented earnings increased by $19 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 and are equivalent to comparable EBIT. Earnings from our Mexico operations are underpinned by long-term, stable, primarily U.S. dollar-denominated revenue contracts, and are affected by the cost of providing service. A weaker U.S. dollar had a negative impact on the Canadian dollar equivalent segmented earnings from our Mexico operations.\nComparable EBITDA for Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines increased by US$21 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to:\nhigher revenues from operations equity earnings from our investment in the Sur de Texas pipeline which records AFUDC during construction, net of interest expense on an inter-affiliate loan from TransCanada.

In 2018, Keystone XL expenditures are being capitalized.\nLiquids Pipelines earnings are generated primarily by providing pipeline capacity to shippers for fixed monthly payments that are not linked to actual throughput volumes. The Keystone Pipeline System offers uncontracted capacity to the market on a spot basis which provides opportunities to generate incremental earnings.\nComparable EBITDA for Liquids Pipelines increased by $119 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 and was the net effect of:\ncontributions from intra-Alberta pipelines, Grand Rapids and Northern Courier, which began operations in the second half of 2017 higher volumes on the Keystone Pipeline System a higher contribution from liquids marketing activities a weaker U.S. dollar which had a negative impact on the Canadian dollar equivalent earnings from our U.S. operations.\nDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\nDepreciation and amortization increased by $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 as a result of the timing of new facilities being placed in service, partially offset by the effect of a weaker U.S. dollar.\nEnergy\nThe following is a reconciliation of comparable EBITDA and comparable EBIT (our non-GAAP measures) to segmented earnings (the equivalent GAAP measure).\nthree months ended\nMarch 31 (unaudited - millions of $) 2018 2017 Canadian Power Western Power 37 30 Eastern Power 1 82 94 Bruce Power 1 54 91 U.S. Power (US$) 2 6 54 Foreign exchange impact on U.S. Power 2 18 Natural Gas Storage and other 7 21 Business Development (4 ) (3 ) Comparable EBITDA 184 305 Depreciation and amortization (32 ) (40 ) Comparable EBIT 152 265 Specific items: Risk management activities (102 ) (56 ) Loss on sales of U.S. Northeast power generation assets — (11 ) Segmented earnings 50 198 1 Includes our share of equity income from our investments in Portlands Energy and Bruce Power.\n2 In second quarter 2017, we completed the sales of our U.S. Northeast power generation assets.\nEnergy segmented earnings decreased by $148 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 and included the following specific items:\nunrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value of derivatives used to reduce our exposure to certain commodity price risks, as noted in the table below in 2017, $11 million of pre-tax costs related to the monetization of our U.S. Northeast power generation business.\nRisk management activities three months ended\nMarch 31 (unaudited - millions of $, pre-tax) 2018 2017 Canadian Power 2 1 U.S. Power (101 ) (62 ) Natural Gas Storage (3 ) 5 Total unrealized losses from risk management activities (102 ) (56 ) The variances in these unrealized gains and losses reflect the impact of changes in forward natural gas and power prices and the volume of our positions for these derivatives over a certain period of time, however, they do not accurately reflect the gains and losses that will be realized on settlement, or the offsetting impacts of other derivative and non-derivative transactions that make up our business as a whole. As a result, we do not consider them reflective of our underlying operations.\nComparable EBITDA for Energy decreased by $121 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 mainly due to the net effect of:\nlower contribution from U.S. Power due to the sales of our generation assets in second quarter 2017 and the continued wind down of our U.S. Power marketing operations, partially offset by income recognized on the sale of our retail contracts in the first quarter of 2018 decreased Bruce Power earnings primarily due to lower volumes resulting from increased outage days. Additional financial and operating information on Bruce Power is provided below decreased Natural Gas Storage results mainly due to lower realized natural gas storage price spreads lower Eastern Power results mainly due to the sale of our Ontario solar assets in December 2017 increased Western Power results due to higher realized prices on higher generation volumes.\nDEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\nDepreciation and amortization decreased by $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 following the sale of our Ontario solar assets in December 2017.\nBRUCE POWER\nThe following reflects our proportionate share of the components of comparable EBITDA and comparable EBIT.\nthree months ended\nMarch 31 (unaudited - millions of $, unless noted otherwise) 2018 2017 Equity income included in comparable EBITDA and EBIT comprised of: Revenues 371 401 Operating expenses (227 ) (224 ) Depreciation and other (90 ) (86 ) Comparable EBITDA and EBIT 1 54 91 Bruce Power – other information Plant availability 2 85 % 89 % Planned outage days 74 56 Unplanned outage days 31 17 Sales volumes (GWh) 1 5,696 5,983 Realized sales price per MWh 3 $ 67 $67 1 Represents our 48.4 per cent (2017 - 48.4 per cent) ownership interest in Bruce Power.

There is a corresponding foreign exchange gain included in Interest income and other on the inter-affiliate loan receivable which fully offsets this loss in 2017, pre-tax integration and acquisition costs associated with the acquisition of Columbia.\nOTHER INCOME STATEMENT ITEMS\nInterest expense\nthree months ended\nMarch 31 (unaudited - millions of $) 2018 2017 Interest on long-term debt and junior subordinated notes Canadian dollar-denominated (134 ) (108 ) U.S. dollar-denominated (314 ) (317 ) Foreign exchange impact (83 ) (103 ) (531 ) (528 ) Other interest and amortization expense (22 ) (17 ) Capitalized interest 26 45 Interest expense (527 ) (500 ) Interest expense increased by $27 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 and primarily reflects the net effect of:\nlong-term debt and junior subordinated notes issuances, net of maturities final repayment of the Columbia acquisition bridge facilities in June 2017, resulting in lower interest expense and debt amortization expense the positive impact of a weaker U.S. dollar in translating U.S. dollar denominated interest lower capitalized interest primarily due to completion of construction of Grand Rapids and Northern Courier in 2017.\nAllowance for funds used during construction\nthree months ended\nMarch 31 (unaudited - millions of $) 2018 2017 Canadian dollar-denominated 20 50 U.S. dollar-denominated 67 38 Foreign exchange impact 18 13 Allowance for funds used during construction 105 101 AFUDC increased by $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.\nThe decrease in Canadian dollar-denominated AFUDC is primarily due to the October 2017 decision not to proceed with the Energy East pipeline project.\nThe increase in U.S. dollar-denominated AFUDC is primarily due to additional investment in and higher rates on Columbia Gas and Columbia Gulf growth projects, as well as continued investment in Mexico projects.\nInterest income and other\nthree months ended\nMarch 31 (unaudited - millions of $) 2018 2017 Interest income and other included in comparable earnings 63 5 Specific items: Foreign exchange gain – inter-affiliate loan 79 — Risk management activities (79 ) 15 Interest income and other 63 20 Interest income and other increased by $43 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 and was primarily the net effect of:\ninterest income along with the $79 million foreign exchange gain related to an inter-affiliate loan receivable from the Sur de Texas joint venture. The corresponding interest expense and foreign exchange loss are reflected in Income from equity investments in the Mexico Natural Gas Pipelines and Corporate segments, respectively. Both currency-related amounts are excluded from comparable earnings unrealized losses on risk management activities in 2018 compared to unrealized gains in 2017. These amounts have been excluded from comparable earnings realized gains in 2018 compared to realized losses in 2017 on derivatives used to manage our net exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on U.S. dollar-denominated income.\nIncome tax expense\nthree months ended\nMarch 31 (unaudited - millions of $) 2018 2017 Income tax expense included in comparable earnings (173 ) (244 ) Specific items: Risk management activities 52 20 Integration and acquisition related costs – Columbia — 15 Keystone XL income tax recoveries — 7 Loss on sales of U.S. Northeast power generation assets — 1 Keystone XL asset costs — 1 Income tax expense (121 ) (200 ) Income tax expense included in comparable earnings decreased by $71 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 mainly due to lower income tax rates as a result of U.S. Tax Reform and lower flow-through income taxes in Canadian rate-regulated pipelines.\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests\nthree months ended\nMarch 31 (unaudited - millions of $) 2018 2017 Net income attributable to non-controlling interests (94 ) (90 ) Net income attributable to non-controlling interests increased by $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to higher earnings, partially offset by our acquisition of the remaining outstanding publicly held common units of CPPL in February 2017.\nPreferred share dividends\nthree months ended\nMarch 31 (unaudited - millions of $) 2018 2017 Preferred share dividends (40 ) (41 )\nRecent developments\nCANADIAN NATURAL GAS PIPELINES\nNGTL System\nThe NGTL 2017 Expansion Program is now complete and approximately $160 million of facilities have been placed in service since December 31, 2017, including the Northwest Mainline Loop-Boundary Lake pipeline on April 2, 2018. The 2017 Expansion Program added approximately 230 km (143 miles) of new pipeline along with additional compression facilities and increased the NGTL System capacity by approximately 535 TJ/d (500 MMcf/d).\nOn March 20, 2018, we announced the successful completion of an open season for additional expansion capacity at the Empress / McNeill Export Delivery Point for service expected to commence in November 2021. The offering of 300 TJ/d (280 MMcf/d) was oversubscribed, with an average awarded contract term of approximately 22 years. The facilities and capital requirements for the expansion are still being finalized and are currently anticipated to increase NGTL's $7.2 billion capital program by approximately $120 million.\nSundre Crossover Project\nOn April 9, 2018, we announced that the Sundre Crossover project was placed in service. The approximate $100 million pipeline project increases NGTL System capacity at our Alberta / B.C. export delivery point by 245 TJ/d (228 MMcf/d), enhancing connectivity to key downstream markets in the Pacific Northwest and California.\nNGTL 2018 - 2019 Revenue Requirement Settlement\nOn March 23, 2018, we filed an application with the NEB for approval of a negotiated settlement with our customers and other interested parties on the annual costs required to operate the NGTL System for 2018 and 2019, along with final 2018 tolls and revised interim 2018 tolls. The settlement fixes ROE at 10.1 per cent on 40 per cent deemed equity and increases the composite depreciation rate from 3.18 per cent to 3.45 per cent. OM&A costs are fixed at $225 million for 2018 and $230 million for 2019 with a 50/50 sharing mechanism for any variances between the fixed amounts and actual OM&A costs. All other costs, including pipeline integrity expenses and emissions costs, are treated as flow-through expenses. The NEB is reviewing comments from interested parties and we anticipate a decision on the application in second quarter 2018.\nCanadian Mainline\nCanadian Mainline 2018 - 2020 Toll Review\nOn March 16, 2018, the NEB provided its Notice of Public Hearing for our Supplemental Agreement with the Eastern LDCs filed on December 18, 2017. Our reply evidence is due September 18, 2018. The NEB will provide further details regarding an oral or written hearing process to consider the written submissions of the interested parties.\nMaple Compressor Expansion Project\nWe continue to await an NEB decision on our application seeking project approval and are reviewing project plans to continue to meet our in-service timelines.\nU.S. NATURAL GAS PIPELINES\nCameron Access\nThe Cameron Access project was placed in service on March 13, 2018 and is a Columbia Gulf project designed to transport approximately 0.9 PJ/d (0.8 Bcf/d) of gas supply to the Cameron LNG export terminal in Louisiana.\nMountaineer XPress and WB XPress\nIn first quarter 2018, estimated project costs of US$3.0 billion for Mountaineer XPress and US$0.9 billion for WB XPress have increased by US$0.4 billion and US$0.1 billion, respectively. These increases primarily reflect the impact of delays of various regulatory approvals from FERC and other agencies, increased contractor construction costs due to unusually high demand for construction resources in the region, and modifications to contractor work plans and resources to maintain our projected in-service dates.\nGreat Lakes and Norther Border Rate Settlements\nIn February 2018, FERC approved the 2017 Great Lakes Rate Settlement and the 2017 Northern Border Rate Settlement, both of which were uncontested.\nMEXICO NATURAL GAS PIPELINES\nTula and Villa de Reyes\nWe continue to work toward finalizing amending agreements for both of these pipelines with the CFE to formalize the schedule and payments resulting from their respective force majeure events. The CFE has commenced payments on both pipelines in accordance with the TSAs.\nSur de Texas\nOffshore construction is now approximately 80 per cent complete and the project continues to progress toward an anticipated in-service date of late 2018.\nLIQUIDS PIPELINES\nKeystone XL\nIn December 2017, an appeal to Nebraska's Court of Appeals was filed by intervenors after the Nebraska Public Service Commission (PSC) issued an approval of an alternative route for the Keystone XL project in November 2017. On March 14, 2018, the Nebraska Supreme Court, on its own motion, agreed to bypass the Court of Appeals and hear the appeal case against the PSC's alternative route itself. We expect the Nebraska Supreme Court, as the final arbiter, could reach a decision by late 2018 or first quarter 2019.\nThe Keystone XL Presidential Permit, issued in March 2017, has been challenged in two separate lawsuits commenced in Montana. Together with the U.S. Department of Justice, we are actively participating in these lawsuits to defend both the issuance of the permit and the exhaustive environmental assessments that support the U.S. President’s actions. Legal arguments addressing the merits of these lawsuits are scheduled to be heard in late May 2018 and we believe the court’s decisions may be issued by year-end 2018.\nThe South Dakota Public Utilities Commission permit for the Keystone XL project was issued in June 2010 and recertified in January 2016. An appeal of that recertification was denied in June 2017 and that decision has been further appealed to the South Dakota Supreme Court. On April 6, 2018 the Supreme Court directed the parties to address whether the Court lacks jurisdiction under the governing statute to consider the appeal. Legal arguments are scheduled for April 2018. A decision from the Supreme Court is expected in second quarter or third quarter 2018.\nWhite Spruce\nIn February 2018, the AER issued a permit for the construction of the White Spruce pipeline. Construction has commenced with an anticipated in-service date in second quarter 2019.\nENERGY\nMonetization of U.S. Northeast power business\nOn March 1, 2018, as part of the continued wind down of our U.S. power marketing operations, we closed the sale of our U.S. power retail contracts for proceeds of approximately US$23 million and recognized income of US$10 million (US$7 million after tax).\nFinancial condition\nWe strive to maintain strong financial capacity and flexibility in all parts of the economic cycle. We rely on our operating cash flow to sustain our business, pay dividends and fund a portion of our growth. In addition, we access capital markets to meet our financing needs, manage our capital structure and to preserve our credit ratings.\nWe believe we have the financial capacity to fund our existing capital program through our predictable and growing cash flow from operations, access to capital markets, including through our corporate ATM program and our Dividend Reinvestment Plan, portfolio management, cash on hand and substantial committed credit facilities. In light of the 2018 FERC Actions, further drop downs of assets into TC PipeLines, LP are not considered to be a viable funding lever. In addition, the TC PipeLines, LP ATM program is not currently being utilized. It is uncertain whether these will be restored as competitive financing options in the future. See the 2018 FERC Actions section for further information.\nAt March 31, 2018, our current assets totaled $4.6 billion and current liabilities amounted to $11.9 billion, leaving us with a working capital deficit of $7.3 billion compared to a deficit of $5.2 billion at December 31, 2017. Our working capital deficiency is considered to be in the normal course of business and is managed through:\nour ability to generate cash flow from operations our access to capital markets approximately $9.1 billion of unutilized, unsecured credit facilities.\nCASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES\nthree months ended\nMarch 31 (unaudited - millions of $, except per share amounts) 2018 2017 Net cash provided by operations 1,412 1,302 Increase in operating working capital 207 155 Funds generated from operations 1 1,619 1,457 Specific items: Integration and acquisition related costs – Columbia — 32 Keystone XL asset costs — 8 Net loss on sales of U.S. Northeast power generation assets — 11 Comparable funds generated from operations 1 1,619 1,508 Dividends on preferred shares (39 ) (39 ) Distributions paid to non-controlling interests (69 ) (80 ) Maintenance capital expenditures – recoverable in future tolls (224 ) (137 ) – other (64 ) (49 ) Comparable distributable cash flow 1 – reflecting all maintenance capital expenditures 1,223 1,203 – reflecting only non-recoverable maintenance capital expenditures 1,447 1,340 Comparable distributable cash flow per common share 1 – reflecting all maintenance capital expenditures $ 1.38 $1.39 – reflecting only non-recoverable maintenance capital expenditures $ 1.64 $1.55 1 See the Non-GAAP measures section of this MD&A for further discussion of funds generated from operations, comparable funds generated from operations, comparable distributable cash flow and comparable distributable cash flow per common share.\nCOMPARABLE FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS\nComparable funds generated from operations, a non-GAAP measure, helps us assess the cash generating ability of our operations by excluding the timing effects of working capital changes.\nDespite the sales of our U.S. power generation assets in second quarter 2017 and the continued wind down of our U.S. Power marketing operations, comparable funds generated from operations increased by $111 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. This increase is primarily due to higher comparable EBITDA (excluding income from equity investments) and higher interest income and other, partially offset by higher interest expense.\nCOMPARABLE DISTRIBUTABLE CASH FLOW\nComparable distributable cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, helps us assess the cash available to common shareholders before capital allocation.\nThe increase in comparable distributable cash flow for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily reflects higher comparable funds generated from operations, as described above, partially offset by higher recoverable maintenance capital expenditures on Canadian and U.S. natural gas pipelines. Comparable distributable cash flow per common share for the three months ended March 31, 2018 also reflects the effect of common shares issued in 2017 and 2018.\nAlthough we deduct maintenance capital expenditures in determining comparable distributable cash flow, we have the ability to recover the majority of these costs in Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines, U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines and Liquids Pipelines. Canadian natural gas pipelines maintenance capital expenditures are reflected in rate bases, on which we earn a regulated return and subsequently recover in tolls. Almost all of our U.S. natural gas pipelines can recover maintenance capital through tolls under current rate settlements, or have the ability to recover such expenditures through tolls established in future rate cases or settlements. Tolling arrangements in Liquids Pipelines provide for recovery of maintenance capital.\nThe following provides a breakdown of maintenance capital expenditures:\nthree months ended\nMarch 31 (unaudited - millions of $) 2018 2017 Canadian Natural Gas Pipelines 119 48 U.S. Natural Gas Pipelines 103 86 Liquids Pipelines 3 3 Other 1 63 49 Maintenance capital expenditures 288 186 1 Includes contributions to Bruce Power to fund our proportionate share of maintenance capital expenditures.\nCASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES\nthree months ended\nMarch 31 (unaudited - millions of $) 2018 2017 Capital spending Capital expenditures (1,702 ) (1,560 ) Capital projects in development (36 ) (42 ) Contributions to equity investments (358 ) (192 ) (2,096 ) (1,794 ) Other distributions from equity investments 121 363 Deferred amounts and other 110 (85 ) Net cash used in investing activities (1,865 ) (1,516 ) Capital expenditures in 2018 were incurred primarily for the expansion of the Columbia Gas, Columbia Gulf and NGTL System natural gas pipelines, the construction of Mexico natural gas pipelines and the Napanee power generating facility, as well as capital additions to, and maintenance of, our ANR pipeline.\nCosts incurred on capital projects in development were predominantly related to spending on Keystone XL.\nContributions to equity investments increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to our investments in Bruce Power, Sur de Texas and Millenium, partially offset by decreased contributions to Grand Rapids which went into service in August 2017. Contributions to equity investments also includes our proportionate share of Sur de Texas debt financing.\nOther distributions from equity investments primarily reflects our proportionate share of Bruce Power financings undertaken to fund its capital program and make distributions to its partners. In 2018, Bruce Power issued senior notes in capital markets which resulted in distributions totaling $121 million being received by us.\nCASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES\nthree months ended\nMarch 31 (unaudited - millions of $) 2018 2017 Notes payable issued, net 1,812 670 Long-term debt issued, net of issue costs 1 93 — Long-term debt repaid 1 (1,226 ) (1,051 ) Junior subordinated notes issued, net of issue costs — 1,982 Dividends and distributions paid (466 ) (419 ) Common shares issued, net of issue costs 340 18 Partnership units of TC PipeLines, LP issued, net of issue costs 49 92 Common units of Columbia Pipeline Partners LP acquired — (1,205 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 602 87 1 Includes draws and repayments on unsecured loan facility by TC PipeLines, LP.\nLONG-TERM DEBT REPAID\nIn first quarter 2018, long-term debt repaid included retirements by TCPL of US$500 million of Senior Unsecured Notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of 1.875 per cent, US$250 million of Senior Unsecured Notes bearing interest at a floating rate and $150 million of Debentures bearing interest at a fixed rate of 9.45 per cent.\nDIVIDEND REINVESTMENT PLAN\nWith respect to dividends declared on February 15, 2018, the DRP participation rate amongst common shareholders was approximately 38 per cent, resulting in $234 million reinvested in common equity under the program.\nTRANSCANADA CORPORATION ATM EQUITY ISSUANCE PROGRAM\nIn the three months ended March 31, 2018, 5.8 million common shares were issued under the TransCanada ATM program at an average price of $56.51 per common share for gross proceeds of $329 million. Related commissions and fees totaled approximately $3 million, resulting in net proceeds of $326 million. An additional 1.6 million common shares were issued in April 2018, bringing year-to-date gross proceeds to $415 million at an average price of $55.64 per common share.\nTC PIPELINES, LP ATM EQUITY ISSUANCE PROGRAM\nIn the three months ended March 31, 2018, 0.7 million common units were issued under the TC PipeLines, LP ATM program generating net proceeds of approximately US$39 million. At March 31, 2018, our ownership interest in TC PipeLines, LP was 25.5 per cent as a result of issuances under the ATM program and resulting dilution.\nThe TC PipeLines, LP ATM is not currently being utilized, with future issuances under the program uncertain at this time as a result of the 2018 FERC Actions.\nDIVIDENDS\nOn April 26, 2018, we declared quarterly dividends as follows:\nQuarterly dividend on our common shares $0.69 per share Payable on July 31, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 29, 2018.\nQuarterly dividends on our preferred shares Series 1 $0.204125 Series 2 $0.19477534 Series 3 $0.1345 Series 4 $0.15444658 Payable on June 29, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 31, 2018.

In addition, we have demand credit facilities that are also used for general corporate purposes, including issuing letters of credit and providing additional liquidity.\nAt April 23, 2018, we had a total of $11.3 billion of committed revolving and demand credit facilities, including:\nAmount Unused\ncapacity Borrower Description Matures Committed, syndicated, revolving, extendible, senior unsecured credit facilities $3.0 billion $3.0 billion TCPL Supports TCPL's Canadian dollar commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes December 2022 US$2.0 billion US$2.0 billion TCPL Supports TCPL's U.S. dollar commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes December 2018 US$1.0 billion US$0.9 billion TCPL USA Used for TCPL USA general corporate purposes, guaranteed by TCPL December 2018 US$1.0 billion US$0.4 billion Columbia Used for Columbia general corporate purposes, guaranteed by TCPL December 2018 US$0.5 billion US$0.5 billion TAIL Supports TAIL's U.S. dollar commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes, guaranteed by TCPL December 2018 Demand senior unsecured revolving credit facilities $2.1 billion $0.6 billion TCPL/TCPL USA Supports the issuance of letters of credit and provides additional liquidity, TCPL USA facility guaranteed by TCPL Demand MXN$5.0 billion MXN$4.9 billion Mexican subsidiary Used for Mexico general corporate purposes, guaranteed by TCPL Demand At April 23, 2018, our operated affiliates had an additional $0.4 billion of undrawn capacity on committed credit facilities.\nSee Financial risks and financial instruments for more information about liquidity, market and other risks.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nOur capital expenditure commitments have increased by approximately $1.5 billion since December 31, 2017. Increased commitments for Columbia Gas growth projects, as well as our proportionate share of commitments for the ongoing construction of the Sur de Texas natural gas pipeline and the Bruce Power six-unit life extension program, were partially offset by decreased commitments for the Napanee power generating facility.\nThere were no other material changes to our contractual obligations in first quarter 2018 or to payments due in the next five years or after. See the MD&A in our 2017 Annual Report for more information about our contractual obligations.\nFinancial risks and financial instruments\nWe are exposed to liquidity risk, counterparty credit risk and market risk, and have strategies, policies and limits in place to mitigate their impact on our earnings, cash flow and, ultimately, shareholder value. These are designed to ensure our risks and related exposures are in line with our business objectives and risk tolerance.\nSee our 2017 Annual Report for more information about the risks we face in our business. Our risks have not changed substantially since December 31, 2017, other than as described below.\nOn March 1, 2018, as part of the continued wind down of our U.S. power marketing operations, we closed the sale of our U.S. power retail contracts for proceeds of approximately US$23 million and recognized income of US$10 million (US$7 million after tax). We expect to realize the value of the remaining marketing contracts and working capital over time. As a result, our exposure to commodity risk has been reduced.\nLIQUIDITY RISK\nWe manage our liquidity risk by continuously forecasting our cash flow for a 12-month period to ensure we have adequate cash balances, cash flow from operations, committed and demand credit facilities and access to capital markets to meet our operating, financing and capital expenditure obligations under both normal and stressed economic conditions.\nCOUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK\nWe have exposure to counterparty credit risk in the following areas:\naccounts receivable the fair value of derivative assets cash and cash equivalents loans receivable.\nWe review our accounts receivable regularly and record allowances for doubtful accounts using the specific identification method. At March 31, 2018, we had no significant credit losses, no significant credit risk concentration and no significant amounts past due or impaired.\nWe have significant credit and performance exposure to financial institutions because they hold cash deposits and provide committed credit lines and letters of credit that help manage our exposure to counterparties and provide liquidity in commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate derivative markets.\nLOAN RECEIVABLE FROM AFFILIATE\nWe hold a 60 per cent equity interest in a joint venture with IEnova to build, own and operate the Sur de Texas pipeline. We account for the joint venture as an equity investment.\nIn April 2017, we entered into a MXN$13.6 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with the joint venture, which bears interest at a floating rate and matures in March 2022. In December 2017, an amended agreement was entered into to increase the credit facility to MXN$21.3 billion. Draws on the credit facility result in a loan receivable from the joint venture representing our proportionate share of the debt financing requirements advanced to the joint venture. At March 31, 2018, the balance of our loan receivable from the joint venture totaled $1.2 billion (December 31, 2017 - $919 million) and Interest income and other of $27 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 (2017 - nil). Interest income and other is offset by a corresponding proportionate share of interest expense recorded in Income from equity investments.\nFOREIGN EXCHANGE\nWe ",
