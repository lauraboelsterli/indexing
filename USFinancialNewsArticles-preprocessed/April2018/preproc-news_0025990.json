    "text": "EAGAN, Minn., April 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ConvergeOne Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CVON, CVONW) (\" ConvergeOne \") today announced that it is extending the scheduled expiration of its previously announced cash tender offer to purchase ConvergeOne warrants to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 20, 2018.\nOn February 22, 2018, ConvergeOne consummated the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 30, 2017, by and among Forum Merger Corporation (\" Forum \"), FMC Merger Subsidiary Corp., FMC Merger Subsidiary LLC, C1 Investment Corp., and Clearlake Capital Management III, L.P. (the \" Business Combination \"). In connection with the closing, Forum changed its name from Forum Merger Corporation to ConvergeOne Holdings, Inc. As of the open of trading on February 23, 2018, the common stock and warrants of ConvergeOne began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market as \"CVON\" and \"CVONW\", respectively.\nExtension of Scheduled Expiration of Tender Offer\nConvergeOne has decided to extend the expiration date of the Tender Offer such that it now expires at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 20, 2018. The Tender Offer was previously scheduled to expire at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 13, 2018.\nHolders of ConvergeOne warrants who have already tendered their ConvergeOne warrants into the Tender Offer do not have to re-tender their ConvergeOne warrants or take any other action as a result of the extension of the expiration date of the Tender Offer.\nClosing Condition\nIn addition, a new condition to the Tender Offer is that ConvergeOne will have concluded that consummation of the Tender Offer will not constitute a \"Rule 13e-3 transaction\" as such term is defined in Rule 13e-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Tender Offer would constitute a Rule 13e-3 transaction if the Tender Offer was reasonably likely to itself cause the warrants to be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market or deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. ConvergeOne will not waive this condition.\nAs previously announced, regardless of the number of warrants tendered, ConvergeOne expects to receive a letter from the Listing Qualifications Office of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\" Nasdaq \"), indicating that Nasdaq intends to delist the warrants from the Nasdaq Capital Market for the failure to meet the requisite number of warrant holders requirement set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5515(a)(4).\nAbout ConvergeOne\nFounded in 1993, ConvergeOne is a leading global IT service provider of collaboration and technology solutions for large and medium enterprises with decades of experience assisting customers to transform their digital infrastructure and realize a return on investment.
