    "text": "1 COMMENTS OTTAWA—Canada’s unemployment rate was unchanged in March as the labor force expanded and full-time hiring surged, partially retracing steep job losses that took place at the beginning of the year.\nThe Canadian economy added a net 32,300 jobs in March on a seasonally adjusted basis, all of which were in the full-time category, Statistics Canada said Friday. Market expectations were for a net gain of 20,000 new jobs in the month.\nCanada’s jobless rate held steady at 5.8%, matching market expectations, and average hourly wage growth advanced above 3% for a third consecutive month.\n“Despite a clear cooling in the broader growth figures, the Canadian labor market remains healthy, with solid full-time job growth, a low jobless rate and wages firming above 3%,” BMO Capital Markets chief economist Doug Porter said.\nIf the job market remains strong and worries over the North American Free Trade Agreement subside, Mr. Porter said the Bank of Canada could be in a position to raise its benchmark interest rate again. “In the meantime, the bank is still looking at the pronounced cool down in the housing market and the broader concerns of the brewing trade tiff between the U.S. and China,” he said.\nThe Bank of Canada held its key rate steady at 1.25% during its last policy announcement in March, after raising it three times during the past year. While the central bank has indicated that rates are likely to rise further, it has emphasized caution amid uncertainty over Nafta and high levels of Canadian household debt.\nThe U.S. also issued its employment data for March. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said nonfarm payrolls climbed 103,000 and the U.S. jobless rate held steady at a 17-year-low of 4.1%.\nAverage hourly wage growth advanced 3.3% on a one-year basis, the third consecutive month wages moved at a pace above 3%. Wage growth remained below that threshold throughout 2017.\nThe private sector dropped 7,000 jobs in March, while the public sector added 19,600 employees, Statistics Canada said. The number of workers who are self-employed—usually independent contractors or freelancers—advanced by 19,800.\nWrite to Kim Mackrael at kim.mackrael@wsj.com",
