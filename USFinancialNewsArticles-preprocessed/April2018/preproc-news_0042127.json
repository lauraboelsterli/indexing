    "text": " 25 p.m. ET Share \nTreasury secretary says he’s considering trip to ease trade tensions Reuters Steven Mnuchin, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury. \nBy Lingling Wei Bob Davis \nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says he may be heading to Beijing for trade negotiations, suggesting an easing of U.S.-China tensions that have widened to include big-name companies in both countries. \nMnuchin said Saturday he is considering the China trip, and on Sunday, China’s Commerce Ministry said in a terse statement that “the Chinese side welcomes this.” \nThe display of good will, following weeks of harsh words from both sides, gives rise to hope of a thaw in a trade stalemate that has seen both countries slap tariffs on some goods and threaten to impose them on a lengthening list of products. \n“It’s very likely” that Mnuchin will make the trip, said a Chinese official with knowledge of Beijing’s decision-making process. Mnuchin, who declined to comment on the timing of the visit, said he is “cautiously optimistic” about reaching an agreement with Beijing that could defuse the bilateral trade conflict that has rattled world markets in recent weeks. Mnuchin told reporters Saturday that he met with Yi Gang, China’s central-bank governor, at the spring meeting of the International Monetary Fund. Yi passed along Mnuchin’s message about his interest in going to Beijing, according to people familiar with the matter.",
