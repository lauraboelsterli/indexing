    "text": "TUNIS, April 5 (Reuters) - The International Islamic Trade Finance Corp has agreed to lend Pakistan $3.285 billion, its chief executive said on Thursday.\n“We will supply Pakistan with $3 billion to finance trade activities for a period of three years,” Hani Salam Sonbol said, adding that the remaining $285 million would be to finance gasoline purchases.\nJeddah-based International Islamic Trade Finance Corp is the financing arm of the Islamic Development Bank for trade activities. It gave Islamic countries trade financing worth $40 billion in the past 10 years.\n“We will increase our funds to support trade activities and create job opportunities in the next 10 years”, Sonbol told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Tunis, without elaborating.\nThis week the International Islamic Trade Finance Corp agreed a $1.5 billion financing deal with Tunisia to purchase essential commodities for public companies.\nIt concluded a deal with Egypt worth $3 billion in January, Sonbol said.
