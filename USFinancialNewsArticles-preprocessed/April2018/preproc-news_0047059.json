West Bromwich Albion v Liverpool - The Hawthorns, West Bromwich, Britain - April 21, 2018 Liverpool's Mohamed Salah celebrates scoring their second goal REUTERS/Andrew Yates \nSalah was rewarded for his performances which have yielded 41 goals in all competitions since joining from AS Roma last year, helping Liverpool reach the Champions League semi-finals and secure a likely top-four finish in the Premier League. \nThe 25-year-old came out on top of a six-man shortlist, voted for by PFA members from the 92 Premier League and Football League teams, that also included league title winners in Manchester City’s Kevin De Bruyne, Leroy Sane and David Silva. \nSane did, however, win the Young Player of the Year award while Fran Kirby of Chelsea Ladies was named women’s Player of the Year at London’s Grosvenor House hotel.
