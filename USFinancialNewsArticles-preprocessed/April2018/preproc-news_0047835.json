    "text": "2 COMMENTS Matt Maddox, the new chief executive of Wynn Resorts , began the company’s first-quarter earnings call on Tuesday by acknowledging that “it’s definitely been an eventful three months.”\nHe wins points for understatement, though not sensitivity to the serious matter of alleged sexual harassment and rape . After a few perfunctory words about Wynn’s commitment to diversity and equality, Mr. Maddox quickly moved on to touting the company’s stellar assets. “I’m not interested in looking in the rearview mirror,” he said.\nBut objects in the mirror are closer than they appear and still could run this accelerating stock off the road. That risk barely is reflected in Wynn’s share price, which is almost back to its pre-scandal level. Before the Wall Street Journal’s story broke in January , Wynn was trading around $200 a share. After a sharp fall, it is now back up to $190. But the hazards to which founder Steve Wynn exposed the company didn’t vanish entirely with his departure .\nMr. Wynn has said it is “preposterous” that he would assault a woman; he hasn’t responded to other allegations of sexual misconduct.\nFirst, the company has refused to overhaul its board , which was widely viewed as lacking independence from Mr. Wynn. True, it has added three women, but that doesn’t solve the problem of the majority male board members who may have turned a blind eye to Mr. Wynn’s behavior for years. Elaine Wynn, Mr. Wynn’s ex-wife and now the largest shareholder, has pointed to the “exorbitant” pay package recently approved for Mr. Maddox as evidence that “very little has changed” at the company.\nThat matters not only because it gives little reassurance that reputational issues such as sexual harassment will be taken seriously in the future, but also because it suggests that the company’s corporate governance in general isn’t improving. A special committee of the board that is investigating the allegations includes John Hagenbuch, a longtime close friend of Mr. Wynn. As Ms. Wynn has noted, that is “ disconcerting .”\nA more immediate reason for shareholders to be concerned is that the company remains at risk of having its casino licenses revoked. The Massachusetts Gaming Commission is investigating who knew about Mr. Wynn’s alleged behavior and what, if anything, they did about it. That has prompted Wynn Resorts to begin talks to sell its partially built, $2.5 billion casino near Boston . If it is a forced seller then it may not receive a full price.\n“We still like the greater Boston area market,” said Mr. Maddox, who cited the “risk due to heightened rhetoric.”\nLas Vegas remains far more material and the Nevada Gaming Commission is unlikely to revoke the company’s license there, but in Macau, where revenue from Wynn Macau topped $618 million this quarter, Chinese regulators could act. The allegations give them a pretext for replacing Wynn Resorts with a Chinese company, which they might prefer.\nBetting on Wynn shares so close to their pre-scandal level is a real roll of the dice.\nWrite to Elizabeth Winkler at elizabeth.winkler@wsj.com\nCorrections & Amplifications\nMatt Maddox, the new CEO of Wynn Resorts, said, “I’m not interested in looking in the rearview mirror.” An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated Mr. Maddox said: “I’m not concerned with looking in the rearview mirror.” (April 25, 2018)",
