Soccer Football - Ligue 1 - Olympique Lyonnais vs Amiens SC - Groupama Stadium, Lyon, France - April 14, 2018 Lyon's Memphis Depay celebrates scoring their second goal REUTERS/Emmanuel Foudrot \nRunaway leaders Paris Saint Germain, who are 14 points ahead at the top of the table, can secure the title with a win over second-placed Monaco in Paris on Sunday, while Lyon and Marseille battle it out for third place and qualification for Europe’s premier club competition. \nBoth sides were on 63 points before Saturday and, with Marseille away to Troyes on Sunday, Lyon comfortably beat Amiens with Diaz opening the scoring in the 31st minute as he collected a pass from Depay, jinked inside and hammered home the ball. \nDepay got on the scoresheet himself in the 83rd minute, deftly volleying home Bertrand Traore’s cross from close range, and Traore made it three by sweeping the ball into the net two minutes later.
