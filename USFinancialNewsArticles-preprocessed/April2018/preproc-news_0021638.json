    "text": "South Africa's rand traded weaker early on Wednesday after disappointing manufacturing figures and comments from the central bank underscored the fragility of the recent economic rebound.\nAt 0700 GMT the rand was 0.35 percent weaker at 12.0750 per dollar compared to an overnight close of 12.0375 in New York, giving up a brief push firmer towards the 12.00 technical pivot seen as a short-term target for rand bulls.\nData on Tuesday showed manufacturing down on a month on month basis in February following a similarly poor print in the previous month, reawakening fears that the country's economic growth outlook remain uncertain despite the uptick in sentiment.\nLater on Tuesday the Reserve Bank warned that 2017's boom could fade if details on policy reforms were not forthcoming.\nWith no data releases locally traders said the rand would take direction from industrial and manufacturing data from the United Kingdom as well as comments by European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi and the release of minutes of the Federal Reserve 's last policy meeting.\nStocks opened weaker at 0700 GMT, with the blue-chip Top-40 Index down 0.2 percent at 49,934 points.\nBonds were weaker, with the yield on the benchmark 2026 paper up 1 basis point to 8.115 percent.",
