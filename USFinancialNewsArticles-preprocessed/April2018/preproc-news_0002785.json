    "text": "First Patient Enrolled in CYPRESS 1 Trial in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer\nREDWOOD CITY, Calif., April 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ARMO BioSciences, Inc. (Nasdaq:ARMO), a late-stage immuno-oncology company, today announced its financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\n“2017 was a great year for ARMO as we advanced the development of AM0010 as an immuno-oncology therapeutic,” said Peter Van Vlasselaer, PhD Chief Executive Officer of ARMO BioSciences. “In the first quarter of 2018 we have already completed our over-subscribed initial public offering, successfully cleared the first interim analysis in the SEQUOIA trial in pancreatic cancer, and have now dosed the first patients in both our CYPRESS 1 and CYPRESS 2 NSCLC Phase 2 trials. With first looks at CYPRESS data, the commencement of a clinical trial in Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) and the commencement of a Phase 1 dose escalation trial of our anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor (AM0001) all expected by the end of the year, 2018 is shaping up to be another exciting year for ARMO.”\nFinancial Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNet loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $42.4 million or $28.52 per share, as compared to $33.6 million or $26.25 per share for the same period in 2016.\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses were $37.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $29.2 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in R&D expense was primarily due to the commencement of the SEQUOIA Phase 3 pancreatic cancer trial in the first half of 2017.\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses were $5.7 million for fiscal 2017 compared to $4.6 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in G&A expenses was due primarily to higher legal and employee-related costs associated with preparing to become a public reporting company.\nAs of December 31, 2017, ARMO had cash and cash equivalents totaling $49.5 million, compared to $26.7 million at December 31, 2016.\nSubsequent to year end 2017, ARMO completed its initial public offering in which it sold shares of its common stock to the public generating net proceeds of approximately $133.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.\nAbout AM0010 Immunotherapy\nAM0010 (pegilodecakin) is a long-acting PEGylated form of recombinant human Interleukin-10 (IL-10) which exerts an anti-cancer effect by stimulating the survival, expansion and cytotoxic (killing) potential of CD8+ T cells. An abundance of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells is believed to improve the prognosis and lengthen the survival of cancer patients. AM0010 is currently being investigated in SEQUOIA, a pivotal Phase 3 randomized clinical trial in pancreatic cancer. Results from a Phase 1/1b clinical trial in over 350 cancer patients demonstrated a good safety/tolerability profile for AM0010 and sustained anti-tumor effects across several different cancer types, including pancreatic cancer, renal cell carcinoma, NSCLC and others. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Commission (EC) have granted AM0010 Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. AM0010 has also been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA in combination with FOLFOX as second-line therapy in patients with pancreatic cancer.\nAbout ARMO BioSciences\nARMO BioSciences is a late-stage immuno-oncology company that is developing a pipeline of novel, proprietary product candidates that activate the immune system of cancer patients to recognize and eradicate tumors. The Company’s lead product candidate, AM0010 (pegilodecakin, PEGylated Interleukin-10), has demonstrated clinical benefit as a single agent, and in combination with both chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor therapy, across several tumor types. The drug is currently being investigated in a Phase 3 randomized pivotal clinical trial in pancreatic cancer patients. ARMO also has a number of other immuno-oncology product candidates in various stages of pre-clinical development including: AM0001, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody; AM0003, an anti-LAG-3 checkpoint inhibitor; AM0015, form of recombinant human Interleukin-15 (IL-15); and AM0012, a form of recombinant human Interleukin-12 (IL-12).
