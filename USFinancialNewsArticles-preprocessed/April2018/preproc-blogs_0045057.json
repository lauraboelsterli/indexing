    "text": "Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie 's official portrait will cost $85,000, which is more than taxpayers shelled out for paintings of his three predecessors combined.\nThe Record reports that Australian artist Paul Newton will paint the portrait of the Republican who left office after eight years in January.\nThe cost detail was obtained through an open records request.\nDemocrats Jon Corzine, Richard Codey and Jim McGreevey spent a combined $74,500 for theirs. None served for two terms.\nAndrew Mills | NJ Advance Media | AP In this Sunday, July 2, 2017, photo, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, right, uses the beach with his family and friends at the governor's summer house at Island Beach State Park in New Jersey. The Christie painting will likely be more formal than one of his best-known images of him after he was photographed sitting on a beach closed to the public due to a budget stalemate last year.\nChristie appreciated luxury, watching the Dallas Cowboys from owner Jerry Jones' box and going to Jordan on the King Abdullah II's dime.",
