    "text": "WESTERVILLE, Ohio, April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Lancaster Colony Corporation (Nasdaq: LANC) today reported results for the company's fiscal third quarter ended March 31, 2018. Highlights for the quarter are as follows:\nConsolidated net sales increased 0.8% to a third quarter record $296.2 million versus $293.8 million last year. Retail net sales were essentially flat at $152.0 million. Sales of shelf-stable dressings and sauces under license agreements remained a growth driver while frozen bread sales volumes declined from the prior-year quarter as we recovered from the disruptions in the supply of our garlic toast products. We implemented pricing actions for our primary refrigerated produce dressings and dips as planned, but our net price realization for the quarter was marginalized by offsetting trade spend, including our previous commitments to retailer promotional activities. Foodservice net sales grew 1.5% to $144.2 million driven by pricing actions taken to help offset higher freight and commodity costs combined with volume increases for frozen yeast rolls and frozen pasta. Consolidated gross profit declined $4.0 million to $67.9 million due to the impact of significantly increased freight charges and higher commodity costs. The Foodservice segment pricing and savings realized from our lean six sigma program served to partially offset the higher costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses declined $2.0 million on reduced spending for consumer promotions and cost savings gained through the realignment of our retail broker network. Consolidated operating income increased from $22.0 million to $37.7 million. Excluding the pre-tax charge of $17.6 million in the prior-year quarter resulting from the company's withdrawal from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan, operating income declined $1.9 million or 5.0%. Based on the factors referenced above and excluding the multiemployer pension plan withdrawal charge, consolidated operating margin decreased about 80 basis points. Retail segment operating margin declined from 19.2% to 17.3% while Foodservice segment operating margin improved from 9.6% to 9.9%. Net income was $27.6 million, or $1.00 per diluted share, compared to $14.5 million, or $.53 per diluted share last year. Note that the lower tax rate of 27.4% in the current year reflects the favorable impact of the recent federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"Tax Act\"). The aforementioned multiemployer pension plan withdrawal charge reduced the prior year's net income by approximately $11.5 million or $.42 per diluted share. The regular quarterly cash dividend paid on March 30, 2018 was maintained at the higher amount of $.60 per share set in November 2017. The company's balance sheet remained debt free on March 31, 2018 with $187.3 million in cash and equivalents.\nFor the nine months ended March 31, 2018, net sales increased to $914.8 million compared to $912.0 million a year ago. Net income for the nine-month period totaled $102.9 million, or $3.74 per diluted share, versus the prior-year amount of $86.8 million, or $3.16 per diluted share. As previously reported in our fiscal second quarter earnings release, in addition to the favorable impact of a lower federal income tax rate, the Tax Act also resulted in a one-time deferred tax benefit to this fiscal year's net income of $9 million or $.33 per diluted share. Conversely, last year's net income amount was unfavorably impacted by the costs resulting from the company's withdrawal from an underfunded multiemployer pension plan of approximately $11.5 million or $.42 per diluted share.\nCEO David A. Ciesinski commented, \"We were pleased to report record net sales in our fiscal third quarter and were particularly encouraged by the higher Foodservice segment sales as our pricing actions took hold to help offset increased commodity and freight costs while the segment's overall sales volumes held nearly flat. Our lean six sigma program also had another successful quarter in identifying and implementing cost-saving projects throughout our supply chain. In the Retail segment, we finished the quarter with the disruption in the production and supply of our frozen garlic bread products behind us and are now positioned to return to growth and resume promotional support for that product line in the coming quarters. Freight costs were a notable headwind to our fiscal third quarter results and are expected to remain so through our fiscal fourth quarter. We have initiatives in place or planned for both the short- and long-term to address higher freight and commodity costs including further Retail pricing actions, a more optimized distribution network and tactical procurement.\"\nConference Call on the Web\nThe company's third quarter conference call is scheduled for this morning, April 26, at 10:00 a.m. ET. You may access a live webcast of the call through a link on the company's Internet home page at www.lancastercolony.com .
