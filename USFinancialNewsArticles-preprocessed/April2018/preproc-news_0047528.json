    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Avidbank Holdings, Inc. (\"the Company\") (OTC Pink: AVBH), a bank holding company and the parent company of Avidbank (\"the Bank\"), an independent full-service commercial bank serving businesses and consumers in Northern California, announced unaudited consolidated net income of $2,107,000 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $1,554,000 for the same period in 2017.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nNet interest income was $8,586,000 for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $1,618,000 over the $6,968,000 we achieved in the first quarter of 2017. The 23% increase over the prior year quarter reflects the impact of our loan growth over the past twelve months. Net income was $2,107,000 for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $1,554,000 for the first quarter of 2017. Results for the first quarter of 2018 included no loan loss provision compared to a loan loss provision of $721,000 in the first quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.36 for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.33 for the first quarter of 2017. Total assets grew by 5% in the first three months of 2018, ending the first quarter at $822 million. Total loans net of deferred fees grew by 2% in the first three months of 2018, ending the first quarter at $662 million. Total deposits grew by 3% in the first three months of 2018, ending the first quarter at $666 million. The Company continues to be well capitalized for regulatory purposes with a Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 11.4%, a Tier 1 Risk Based Capital and Common Equity Tier 1 Risk Based Capital Ratio of 10.8%, and a Total Risk Based Capital Ratio of 13.2%.\nMark D. Mordell, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"Net interest income increased to $8.6 million in the first quarter of 2018, a 23% increase over the first quarter of 2017 due to our loan growth over the past twelve months. Loans grew $14 million in the first quarter even as we absorbed our record growth from the previous quarter and experienced a high level of payoffs in our Specialty Finance division due primarily to the active merger and acquisition markets. We are committed to a growth strategy to achieve optimal profitability and have made substantial investments in personnel and facilities to help realize that goal responsibly. In January 2018, we more than doubled the size of our space at our San Francisco location to accommodate our rapidly growing staff. We are well positioned to continue the franchise growth strategy to scale our balance sheet and infrastructure to serve our markets.”\nMr. Mordell continued, \"In 2017, we added both business development and support staff to sustain and manage our growth. We also expanded and relocated our facilities to accommodate our growth in staff as well as increase staff retention due to more favorable commute times. Non-interest expenses increased by $1.9 million to $6.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, from $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to these increased investments. Our efficiency ratio increased to 67.3% in the first quarter of 2018 from 58.7% in the first quarter of 2017 as a result of the increased expenses. Total deposits increased by $20 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased by $74 million from the same quarter in 2017. The increase in deposits for the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to an increase in demand deposits and money market accounts. Our net interest margin grew to 4.55% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 4.26% in the first quarter of 2017 due to changes in the mix of earning assets in favor of higher yielding loans. Return on assets was 1.06% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 0.91% in the first quarter of 2017.\"\nResults for the quarter ended March 31, 2018\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, net interest income before provision for loan losses was $8.6 million, an increase of $1.6 million or 23% compared to the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily the result of higher average loans outstanding. Average total loans outstanding for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $654 million, compared to $539 million for the same quarter in 2017, an increase of 21%. Average earning assets were $766 million in the first quarter of 2018, a 16% increase over the first quarter of the prior year. Loans made up 85% of average earning assets at the end of the first quarter of 2018 compared to 81% at the end of the first quarter of 2017. Net interest margin was 4.55% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 4.26% for the first quarter of 2017. No loan loss provision was taken in the first quarter of 2018 compared with a loan loss provision of $721,000 taken in the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-interest income was $704,000 in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $183,000 or 35% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Non-interest income in the first quarter of 2018 included $281,000 from earnings from an investment in a Small Business Investment Corporation (SBIC) fund while non-interest income in the prior year's quarter included $112,000 from the exercise of common stock warrants related to a Specialty Finance loan.\nNon-interest expense increased by $1,857,000 in the first quarter of 2018 to $6,252,000 compared to $4,395,000 for the first quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily due to higher compensation costs related to increased staffing and increased occupancy costs due to the expansion of our facilities. The Bank's full time equivalent employees at March 31, 2018 and 2017 were 88 and 70, respectively. The Bank's efficiency ratio increased from 58.7% in the first quarter of 2017 to 67.3% in the first quarter of 2018 due to increased staffing and facilities costs to accommodate our growth.\nThe effective tax rate was 30.6% in the first three months of 2018 compared to 34.5% for the same period in 2017. The rate declined in 2018 due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act federal income tax rate reduction becoming effective for the 2018 tax year.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets increased to $822 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $783 million at December 31, 2017 and $702 million on the same day one year ago. The increase in total assets of $39 million, or 5%, from December 31, 2017 was primarily due to increased FHLB borrowings and increased demand deposit accounts in the first quarter of 2018. The Company reported total loans at March 31, 2018 of $662 million, which represented an increase of $14 million, or 2%, from $648 million at December 31, 2017, and an increase of $105 million, or 19%, over $557 million at March 31, 2017. The increase in total loans for both periods was primarily attributable to growth in commercial real estate, multi-family and construction loans. The increase in loans from March 31, 2017 also included higher Specialty Finance and commercial loans.\n\"We had $2.3 million in non-accrual loans comprising 0.34% of total loans from one relationship on March 31, 2018 compared to $5.2 million in non-accrual loans at the end of the prior year. We are pleased that the balance of our non-accrual loans was reduced by more than half in the first quarter of 2018,” observed Mr. Mordell.\nThe Company’s total deposits were $666 million as of March 31, 2018, which represented an increase of $20 million, or 3%, compared to $646 million at December 31, 2017 and an increase of $73 million, or 12%, compared to $593 million at March 31, 2017. The increase in deposits from December 31, 2017 was due to an increase in demand deposits and money market accounts. The increase from March 31, 2017 was caused by an increase in money market accounts, demand deposits and CDs greater than $250,000. The Company had $50 million of Federal Home Loan Bank advances outstanding as of March 31, 2018.\nDemand and interest bearing transaction deposits represented 46% of total deposits at March 31, 2018, compared to 45% at December 31, 2017 and 48% for the same period one year ago. Core deposits, which include transaction deposits, money market accounts and CDs below $250,000, represented 87% of total deposits at March 31, 2018, compared to 87% at December 31, 2017 and 87% at March 31, 2017. The Company’s loan to deposit ratio was 99% at March 31, 2018 compared to 100% at December 31, 2017 and 94% at March 31, 2017.\nAbout Avidbank\nAvidbank Holdings, Inc.
