He was followed to the mound by Mike Montgomery and Pedro Strop.\nAnthony Rizzo’s two-out single through the shift in the top of the fifth inning drove home Ian Happ with the game’s first run.\nGuyer bashed a two-out solo home run off the left field foul pole against Lester in the bottom of the inning to bring the game back to all square, at 1-1.\nCleveland kept to the long ball to take the lead and expand on it in the sixth with solo homers by Lindor and Encarnacion, the latter with two outs.\nThe Indians added to their lead in the eighth when Lindor scored from first on a bunt by Jason Kipnis and a throwing error by Rizzo\nThe Indians will remain at home for a four-game series against Seattle that begins Thursday with right-hander Mike Clevinger (2-0, 1.75 ERA) taking the mound for Cleveland to oppose Mariners left-hander James Paxton (1-1, 5.61).\nThe Cubs head back to the Windy City’s North Side to begin a four-game series with Milwaukee, with Chicago right-hander Kyle Hendricks (1-1, 4.09) and Brewers right-hander Chase Anderson (2-1, 3.25) listed as Thursday’s probable starting pitchers.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
