    "text": "WINDSOR, Conn., April 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: SSNC), a global provider of financial services software and software-enabled services, today announced that after a successful acquisition and a number of product releases, SS&C Salentica has seen over 40 percent growth within its client base, which advise on over $850 billion in assets.\nSince the acquisition closed in late 2016, SS&C has focused on strengthening Salentica's CRM capabilities for wealth advisors, asset managers, and their clients. Salentica added new integrations to its Data Broker platform including the Black Diamond 速 Wealth Platform, Advent Portfolio Exchange 速 (APX) and Axys 速 as well as a number of other products including Modestspark and MoneyGuidePro. By partnering with Microsoft 速 and leveraging the Dynamics 365 platform, Salentica CRM is available for deployment in Microsoft's Cloud, on premise, and in Salentica's privately-hosted model.\nMany existing clients are leveraging these new capabilities to expand and improve client relationships. Recently, Wasmer, Schroeder & Company, an RIA and fixed-income specialist in Naples, FL, launched Salentica CRM to bolster its technology suite. Since they use APX as their portfolio management solution, key to their selection was Salentica's CRM capabilities enabling two-way integration for portfolio creation. This allowed for simpler portfolio and contact changes between their CRM and APX.\n\"We owe much of our recent success to the trust our clients have placed in us to help them overcome the complexities of managing their client relationships,\" said Dave Ireland, Co-General Manager, SS&C Salentica. \"Since joining SS&C, we have realized a number of important milestones and we have seen the benefits of joint initiatives between SS&C and Salentica solutions . We look forward to building on this momentum and delivering more value to wealth managers and their firms.\"\nAbout Wasmer Shroeder & Company\nWasmer, Schroeder & Company is an advisory firm specializing in Separately Managed Account (SMA) management.
