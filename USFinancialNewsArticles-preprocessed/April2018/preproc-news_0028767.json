    "text": "(Reuters) - Elon Musk-led SpaceX Corp is raising $507 million in a new round of funding, valuing the company at around $26 billion, according to a filing seen by Reuters.\nFILE PHOTO: An exterior of the SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California May 29, 2014. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni New articles of incorporation filed by the company last week and sent to Reuters by private analytics firm Lagniappe Labs showed the addition of 3 million ‘Series I’ shares from a previous version filed in November.\nThe filing also gave the initial value of the Series I shares as $169, 25 percent higher than a value given in its previous fundraising round late last year.\nSpaceX declined to comment on the new funding round, which was first reported by tech industry website The Information.\nThe Hawthorne, California-based company has outlined plans for a trip to Mars in 2022, to be followed by a manned mission to the red planet by 2024.\nReporting by Munsif Vengattil and Laharee Chatterjee in Bengaluru and Heather Somerville in San Francisco, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien\n ",
