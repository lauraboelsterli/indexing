    "text": "DALLAS, April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) (the \"Company\") today reported its first quarter 2018 results:\nNet income of $463 million, net margin 1 of 9.4 percent, and record first quarter earnings per diluted share of $.79 Operating income of $616 million and operating margin 2 of 12.5 percent Excluding special items 3 , net income of $438 million, net margin 4 of 8.9 percent, and earnings per diluted share of $.75 Excluding special items, operating income of $584 million and operating margin 5 of 11.8 percent Operating cash flow of $1.0 billion and free cash flow 3 of $708 million Returned $648 million to Shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends Return on invested capital (ROIC) 3 pre-tax of 27.1 percent for the 12 months ended March 31, 2018, or 20.8 percent on an after-tax basis Revised Boeing firm order delivery schedule by exercising 40 737 MAX 8 options, adding 10 firm orders in each year 2019 through 2022, to support future fleet modernization\nGary C. Kelly, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, stated, \"It remains a somber time for the Southwest Family following the Flight 1380 accident, and our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the Riordan family, and all of our Customers on the flight. I want to extend my immense gratitude for the compassion and support shown by our Employees, Customers, and airline peers. We continue to cooperate with the National Transportation Safety Board's thorough investigation to understand the cause of the accident. We will never compromise the Safety of our Customers and Employees. It is our highest priorityâ€”today and always.\n\"With regard to our first quarter performance, our strong profits are a solid start to the year, and our margins are among the top in the industry. Year-over-year growth in operating revenues kept pace with our capacity growth, and costs per available seat mile were also comparable with first quarter last year. With the reduction in the statutory federal income tax rate, our first quarter net income increased significantly, resulting in meaningful year-over-year net margin expansion. Our balance sheet and cash flows remained strong in first quarter, which enabled continued investment in fleet modernization, facilities, and technology; allowed the early funding of 2017 profitsharing of $543 million last month for our Employees; and provided $648 million of share buybacks and dividends for our Shareholders. We accrued another $102 million in profitsharing during first quarter 2018 for the benefit of our Employees. We are encouraged by our first quarter results, and our goal for the year is to expand net income and net margin, excluding special items.\n\"We continue to expect to begin selling tickets in 2018 for service to Hawaii, and today we announce our intent to begin service to four Hawaiian airports: Honolulu International Airport, Lihue Airport, Kona International Airport at Keahole, and Kahului Airport. Additionally, we entered into an agreement with Alaska Airlines to lease 12 slots at New York's LaGuardia Airport and 8 slots at Washington Reagan National Airport. These opportunities complement our network and fit within our existing 2018 growth plans, with available seat miles (ASMs) expected to increase in the low five percent range, year-over-year.\"\nRevenue Results and Outlook\nThe Company's first quarter 2018 total operating revenues increased 1.9 percent, year-over-year, to a first quarter record $4.9 billion, driven largely by first quarter record passenger revenues of $4.6 billion. First quarter operating revenue per available seat mile (RASM, or unit revenues) was comparable with first quarter last year. Strong travel demand resulted in a first quarter record load factor of 81.5 percent. Passenger revenue yield decreased 2.8 percent, year-over-year, primarily due to the competitive yield environment and the impact from operating a sub-optimal flight schedule as a result of a temporarily reduced fleet size due to the retirement of the Boeing 737-300 Classic fleet last year. The Company expects its sub-optimal flight schedule to continue to pressure yields in second quarter. Based on current bookings and revenue trends, the Company expects second quarter 2018 RASM to decrease in the one to three percent range, compared with second quarter 2017 RASM of 14.27 cents, as recast. Approximately one to two points of this estimated decrease is attributable to recent softness in bookings following the Flight 1380 accident.\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted the Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and is using the full retrospective method of adoption allowed by the standard. As such, results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 have been recast under the new standard in order to be comparable with current period results in the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income.\nCost Performance and Outlook\nFirst quarter 2018 total operating expenses increased 1.9 percent to $4.3 billion. Total operating expenses per available seat mile (CASM, or unit costs) increased 0.1 percent, as compared with first quarter 2017. Excluding special items in both periods, first quarter 2018 total operating expenses increased 1.9 percent to $4.4 billion, or 0.1 percent on a unit basis, year-over-year.\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company early adopted ASU No. 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. The new standard eliminated ineffectiveness for all derivatives designated in a hedge for accounting purposes, as well as changed the Company's classification of premium expense associated with fuel hedges from Other (gains) and losses, net, to Fuel and oil expense within the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income. As such, the classification of premium expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017, has been recast under the new standard in order to be comparable with current period results. First quarter 2018 economic fuel costs 3 were $2.09 per gallon, including $.07 per gallon in premium expense and $.05 per gallon in favorable cash settlements from fuel derivative contracts, compared with $2.03 per gallon in first quarter 2017, which included $.07 per gallon in premium expense and $.29 per gallon in unfavorable cash settlements from fuel derivative contracts. First quarter 2018 ASMs per gallon, or fuel efficiency, improved 1.3 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by the retirement of the Classic aircraft and the addition of the more fuel-efficient 737 MAX 8 aircraft.\nBased on the Company's existing fuel derivative contracts and market prices as of April 20, 2018, second quarter 2018 economic fuel costs are estimated to be approximately $2.20 per gallon 6 , including $.06 per gallon in premium expense and an estimated $.07 per gallon in favorable cash settlements from fuel derivative contracts, compared with $1.99 per gallon in second quarter 2017, as recast, which included $.06 per gallon in premium expense and $.32 per gallon in unfavorable cash settlements from fuel derivative contracts. As of April 20, 2018, the fair market value of the Company's fuel derivative contracts for the remainder of 2018 was a net asset of approximately $158 million, and the fair market value of the hedge portfolio settling in 2019 and beyond was a net asset of approximately $308 million. Additional information regarding the Company's fuel derivative contracts is included in the accompanying tables.\nExcluding fuel and oil expense and special items in both periods, first quarter 2018 operating expenses increased 1.5 percent, as compared with first quarter 2017. First quarter 2018 profitsharing expense was $102 million, as compared with $99 million in first quarter 2017. Excluding fuel and oil expense, profitsharing expense, and special items, first quarter 2018 operating expenses increased 1.4 percent, and declined 0.3 percent on a unit basis, year-over-year.\nEarlier this month, the Company reached an Agreement in Principle (AIP) with the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA) that represents the Company's Mechanics and Related Employees.\nBased on current cost trends, the Company estimates second quarter 2018 CASM, excluding fuel and oil expense and profitsharing expense, to increase in the one to two percent range, compared with second quarter 2017's 8.17 cents, as recast, which excluded fuel and oil expense, profitsharing expense, and special items. This second quarter 2018 year-over-year increase includes the current estimated impact of the AIP with AMFA, as well as a preliminary cost estimate related to the Flight 1380 accident. Due primarily to increases in salaries, wages, and benefits, which includes the impact of the AIP with AMFA, the Company now estimates annual 2018 CASM, excluding fuel and oil expense and profitsharing expense, to be comparable with annual 2017's 8.47 cents, as recast, which excluded fuel and oil expense, profitsharing expense, and special items.\nFirst Quarter Results\nFirst quarter 2018 operating income was $616 million, compared with $606 million in first quarter 2017. Excluding special items, first quarter 2018 operating income was $584 million, compared with $574 million in first quarter 2017.\nOther expenses in first quarter 2018 were $14 million, compared with $74 million in first quarter 2017. The $60 million difference resulted primarily from $4 million in other losses recognized in first quarter 2018, compared with $63 million in first quarter 2017. In first quarter 2017, these losses included ineffectiveness and unrealized mark-to-market amounts associated with a portion of the Company's fuel hedge portfolio, which are special items. Excluding these special items related to fuel hedging, other losses were $4 million in first quarter 2018, compared with other gains of $2 million in first quarter 2017. Net interest expense in first quarter 2018 was $10 million, compared with $11 million in first quarter 2017.\nFirst quarter 2018 net income was $463 million, or a first quarter record $.79 per diluted share, compared with first quarter 2017 net income of $339 million, or $.55 per diluted share. Excluding special items, first quarter 2018 net income was $438 million, or $.75 per diluted share, compared with first quarter 2017 net income of $359 million, or $.58 per diluted share, and compared with First Call first quarter 2018 consensus estimate of $.74 per diluted share.\nLiquidity and Capital Deployment\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $3.2 billion in cash and short-term investments, and a fully available unsecured revolving credit line of $1 billion. Net cash provided by operations during first quarter 2018 was $1.0 billion, capital expenditures were $409 million, and free cash flow was $708 million. The Company repaid $82 million in debt and capital lease obligations during first quarter 2018, and expects to repay approximately $254 million in debt and capital lease obligations during the remainder of 2018.\nDuring first quarter 2018, the Company returned $648 million to its Shareholders through the repurchase of $500 million in common stock and the payment of $148 million in dividends. The Company launched and completed a $500 million accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program during first quarter, which equated to approximately 8.72 million shares repurchased. During first quarter 2018, the Company also received approximately 0.74 million shares, which remained pursuant to a $250 million fourth quarter 2017 ASR program. The Company has $850 million remaining under its May 2017 $2.0 billion share repurchase authorization.\nDue to revisions to its future fleet order book with Boeing, the Company now estimates its 2018 capital expenditures to be in the $2.0 to $2.1 billion range.\nFleet and Capacity\nThe Company ended first quarter with 717 aircraft in its fleet. This reflects the first quarter delivery of nine new Boeing 737-800 aircraft, one new Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft, and one pre-owned Boeing 737-700 aircraft. Last month, the Company revised its future firm order delivery schedule with Boeing to support future fleet modernization. The Company exercised 40 737 MAX 8 options which adds 10 additional firm orders in each year 2019 through 2022. Additionally, five 737 MAX 8 firm orders were shifted from 2019 into fourth quarter 2018, and three pre-owned 737-700 aircraft previously scheduled for delivery in 2018 were replaced with three 737 MAX 8 aircraft to be delivered in 2019. Including the Company's revision made to its firm order schedule executed in December 2017, and in recognition of the expected significant savings from tax reform, the Company has exercised a total of 80 options with Boeing to further invest in its fleet to support future growth opportunities and fleet modernization. The Company expects to end 2018 with 752 aircraft in its fleet based on the current aircraft delivery schedule. Additional information regarding the Company's aircraft delivery schedule is included in the accompanying tables.\nThe Company continues to expect its 2018 year-over-year ASM growth to be in the low five percent range, with second quarter 2018 year-over-year ASM growth in the 3.5 to 4 percent range and second half 2018 year-over-year ASM growth in the low seven percent range.\nAwards and Recognitions\nNamed to FORTUNE's list of World's Most Admired Companies.

This gain will be excluded from the Company's estimated second quarter 2018 economic fuel costs per gallon. Therefore, based on the Company's existing fuel derivative contracts and market prices as of April 20, 2018, second quarter 2018 fuel costs per gallon on a GAAP and economic basis are estimated to be approximately $2.19 and approximately $2.20, respectively.

The Company makes this adjustment to enhance comparability to other entities that have different capital structures by utilizing alternative financing decisions.\n(b) Calculated as an average of the five most recent quarter end balances or remaining obligations. The Net present value of aircraft operating leases represents the assumption that all aircraft in the Company's fleet are owned, as it reflects the remaining contractual commitments discounted at the Company's estimated incremental borrowing rate as of the time each individual lease was signed.\n(c) The Equity adjustment for hedge accounting in the denominator adjusts for the cumulative impacts, in Accumulated other comprehensive income and Retained earnings, of gains and/or losses associated with hedge accounting related to fuel hedge derivatives that will settle in future periods. The current period impact of these gains and/or losses is reflected in the Net impact from fuel contracts in the numerator.\n(d) As the twelve month rolling tax rate no longer approximates an annual tax rate due to the significant impact the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation enacted in December 2017 had on corporate tax rates, the Company is utilizing the first quarter tax rate for 2018 ROIC, after-tax. The first quarter 2018 GAAP tax rate was 23.1 percent, and the Non-GAAP tax rate for the period was also 23.1 percent.

The Company's fuel costs per gallon for second quarter and full year 2018 on a GAAP basis are each expected to include a gain of approximately $.01 per gallon, related to contracts settling in second quarter and full year 2018, respectively, but for which the impact has been recognized in a prior period. These expected gains are excluded from the Company's estimated second quarter and full year 2018 economic fuel costs per gallon. Therefore, based on the Company's existing fuel derivative contracts and market prices as of April 20, 2018, second quarter 2018 fuel costs per gallon on a GAAP and economic basis are estimated to be approximately $2.19 and approximately $2.20, respectively; and the provided outlook range for full year 2018 is currently expected to encompass both the GAAP and economic fuel costs per gallon.

These GAAP financial statements include (i) unrealized noncash adjustments and reclassifications, which can be significant, as a result of accounting requirements and elections made under accounting pronouncements relating to derivative instruments and hedging and (ii) other charges and benefits the Company believes are unusual and/or infrequent in nature and thus may make comparisons to its prior or future performance difficult.\nAs a result, the Company also provides financial information in this release that was not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to the information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company provides supplemental non-GAAP financial information (also referred to as \"excluding special items\"), including results that it refers to as \"economic,\" which the Company's management utilizes to evaluate its ongoing financial performance and the Company believes provides additional insight to investors as supplemental information to its GAAP results. The non-GAAP measures provided that relate to the Company's performance on an economic fuel cost basis include Fuel and oil expense, non-GAAP; Total operating expenses, non-GAAP; Operating expenses, non-GAAP excluding Fuel and oil expense; Operating expenses, non-GAAP excluding profitsharing and Fuel and oil expense; Operating income, non-GAAP; Operating margin, non-GAAP; Other (gains) losses, net, non-GAAP; Income tax rate, non-GAAP; 12 month rolling income tax rate, non-GAAP; Net income, non-GAAP; and Net income per share, diluted, non-GAAP. The Company's economic Fuel and oil expense results differ from GAAP results in that they only include the actual cash settlements from fuel hedge contracts - all reflected within Fuel and oil expense in the period of settlement. Thus, Fuel and oil expense on an economic basis has historically been utilized by the Company, as well as some of the other airlines that utilize fuel hedging, as it reflects the Company's actual net cash outlays for fuel during the applicable period, inclusive of settled fuel derivative contracts. Any net premium costs paid related to option contracts that are designated as hedges are reflected as a component of Fuel and oil expense, for both GAAP and non-GAAP (including economic) purposes in the period of contract settlement. The Company believes these economic results provide further insight on the impact of the Company's fuel hedges on its operating performance and liquidity since they exclude the unrealized, noncash adjustments and reclassifications that are recorded in GAAP results in accordance with accounting guidance relating to derivative instruments, and they reflect all cash settlements related to fuel derivative contracts within Fuel and oil expense. This enables the Company's management, as well as investors and analysts, to consistently assess the Company's operating performance on a year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter basis after considering all efforts in place to manage fuel expense. However, because these measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, such measures are susceptible to varying calculations, and not all companies calculate the measures in the same manner. As a result, the aforementioned measures, as presented, may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nFurther information on (i) the Company's fuel hedging program, (ii) the requirements of accounting for derivative instruments, and (iii) the causes of hedge ineffectiveness and/or mark-to-market gains or losses from derivative instruments is included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, as well as its Current Report on Form 8-K furnished to the on March 20, 2018.\nThe Company's GAAP results in the applicable periods include other charges or benefits that are also deemed \"special items,\" that the Company believes make its results difficult to compare to prior periods, anticipated future periods, or industry trends. Financial measures identified as non-GAAP (or as excluding special items) have been adjusted to exclude special items. Special items include:\n1.\nContract ratification bonuses recorded for certain workgroups. As the bonuses would only be paid at ratification of the associated tentative agreement and would not represent an ongoing expense to the Company, management believes its results for the associated periods are more usefully compared if the impacts of ratification bonus amounts are excluded from results. Generally, union contract agreements cover a specified three- to five- year period, although such contracts officially never expire, and the agreed upon terms remain in place until a revised agreement is reached, which can be several years following the amendable date;\n2.\nA noncash impairment charge related to leased slots at Newark Liberty International Airport as a result of the Federal Aviation Administration announcement in April 2016 that this airport was being changed to a Level 2 schedule-facilitated airport from its previous designation as Level 3 (a \"slot\" is the right of an air carrier, pursuant to regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration, to operate a takeoff or landing at a specific time at certain airports);\n3.\nLease termination costs recorded as a result of the Company acquiring 13 of its Boeing 737-300 aircraft off operating leases as part of the Company's strategic effort to remove its Classic aircraft from operations on or before September 29, 2017, in the most economically advantageous manner possible. The Company had not budgeted for these early lease termination costs, as they were subject to negotiations being concluded with the third party lessors. The Company recorded the fair value of the aircraft acquired off operating leases, as well as any associated remaining obligations to the balance sheet as debt;\n4.\nAn Aircraft grounding charge recorded in third quarter 2017, as a result of the Company grounding its remaining Boeing 737-300 aircraft on September 29, 2017. The loss was a result of the remaining net lease payments due and certain lease return requirements that could have to be performed on these leased aircraft prior to their return to the lessors as of the cease-use date. The Company had not budgeted for the lease return requirements, as they were subject to negotiation with third party lessors; and\n5.\nA gain recognized in first quarter 2018, associated with the sale of 39 owned Boeing 737â€“300 aircraft and a number of spare engines, to a third party. These aircraft were previously retired as part of the Company's exit of its Classic fleet. The gain was not anticipated, and the Company associates it in conjunction with the grounding charge recorded in third quarter 2017.\nBecause management believes each of these items can distort the trends associated with the Company's ongoing performance as an airline, the Company believes that evaluation of its financial performance can be enhanced by a supplemental presentation of results that exclude the impact of these items in order to enhance consistency and comparativeness with results in prior periods that do not include such items and as a basis for evaluating operating results in future periods. The following measures are often provided, excluding special items, and utilized by the Company's management, analysts, and investors to enhance comparability of year-over-year results, as well as to industry trends: Total operating expenses, non-GAAP; Operating expenses, non GAAP excluding Fuel and oil expense; Operating expenses, non-GAAP excluding profitsharing and Fuel and oil expense; Operating income, non-GAAP; Operating margin, non-GAAP; Other (gains) losses, net, non-GAAP; Income tax rate, non-GAAP; 12 month rolling income tax rate, non-GAAP; Net income, non-GAAP; and Net income per share, diluted, non-GAAP.\nThe Company has also provided free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company believes free cash flow is a meaningful measure because it demonstrates the Company's ability to service its debt, pay dividends, and make investments to enhance Shareholder value. Although free cash flow is commonly used as a measure of liquidity, definitions of free cash flow may differ; therefore, the Company is providing an explanation of its calculation for free cash flow. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company generated $708 million in free cash flow, calculated as operating cash flows of $1.0 billion less capital expenditures of $409 million less assets constructed for others of $24 million plus reimbursements for assets constructed for others of $139 million.\nThe Company has also provided its calculation of return on invested capital, which is a measure of financial performance used by management to evaluate its investment returns on capital. Return on invested capital is not a substitute for financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP, and should not be utilized in place of such GAAP results. Although return on invested capital is not a measure defined by GAAP, it is calculated by the Company, in part, using non-GAAP financial measures. Those non-GAAP financial measures are utilized for the same reasons as those noted above for Net income, non-GAAP and Operating income, non-GAAP - the comparable GAAP measures include charges or benefits that are deemed \"special items\" that the Company believes make its results difficult to compare to prior periods, anticipated future periods, or industry trends, and the Company's profitability targets and estimates, both internally and externally, are based on non-GAAP results since in the vast majority of cases the \"special items\" cannot be reliably predicted or estimated. The Company believes non-GAAP return on invested capital is a meaningful measure because it quantifies the Company's effectiveness in generating returns relative to the capital it has invested in its business. Although return on invested capital is commonly used as a measure of capital efficiency, definitions of return on invested capital differ; therefore, the Company is providing an explanation of its calculation for non-GAAP return on invested capital in the accompanying reconciliation, in order to allow investors to compare and contrast its calculation to those provided by other companies.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/southwest-reports-first-quarter-profit-300636989.html\nSOURCE Southwest Airlines Co.",
