    "text": "Damian Lillard scored 36 points and dished out 10 assists as the Portland Trail Blazers tripped up the Utah Jazz 102-93 in the regular-season finale for both teams Wednesday night at Moda Center.\nThe victory allowed Portland (49-33) to edge Utah (48-34) for the third seed in the Western Conference playoffs. The Blazers will open the postseason against the sixth-seeded New Orleans Pelicans, while the Jazz fell to the fifth seed, and they will oppose the fourth-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder.\nCJ McCollum added 19 points for the Trail Blazers. Jusuf Nurkic chipped in 13 points and nine rebounds for Portland, which snapped a four-game losing streak.\nDonovan Mitchell and Ricky Rubio each scored 17 points for the Jazz. Rudy Gobert collected 13 points and 13 rebounds for Utah, which had won six games in a row.\nLillard scored 17 points and McCollum 14 to stake Portland to a 55-41 halftime lead. The Jazz shot only 34.8 percent from the field in the first half, though they improved to 37.1 percent by game’s end. Mitchell — who started the game by missing his first eight shots — scored nine points on 3-for-13 shooting in the half.\nPortland’s lead was 70-52 midway through the third quarter. The Blazers carried an 80-59 edge into the fourth quarter.\nThe Blazers upped the margin to 85-61 early in the final period. Utah scored 13 in a row to get it to within 85-74 with 7:37 remaining. Lillard sank a jumper to push Portland’s lead to 87-74, but Jonas Jerebko’s tip-in cut it to 87-76.\nLillard scored on back-to-back step-back jumpers to make to make it 91-76 with 5:40 to go. Utah cut the deficit to 99-90 on a pair of free throws by Jae Crowder with 1:21 to play, but the Jazz would get no closer.\nPortland jumped to a 17-9 lead midway through the first quarter. The Blazers hiked the advantage to 28-19 before settling for a 28-21 lead after one quarter.\nThe Blazers increased the difference to 41-27 midway through the second quarter. Utah scored six in a row to get within 41-33. Portland came back with an 8-2 run to go ahead 49-35. The Blazers’ edge was 14 points at the break.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
