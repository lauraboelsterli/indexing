    "text": "GILLETTE, Wyo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cloud Peak Energy Inc. (NYSE:CLD), one of the largest U.S. coal producers and the only pure-play Powder River Basin (“PRB”) coal company, today announced results for .\nColin Marshall, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, commented, “First quarter shipments were in line with expectations as colder weather in January increased burn and allowed utilities to reduce their stockpiled coal. We expect to see greater balance in coal supply and demand and improvements in coal pricing in the latter part of the year. Export demand remained strong allowing us to export 1.4 million tons during the quarter. We currently have 3.3 million tons of exports under contract and continue to expect to export approximately 5.5 million tons in 2018.”\nFirst Quarter Results\nQuarter Ended (in millions, except per ton amounts) 03/31/18 03/31/17 Consolidated Net income (loss) $ (7.7 ) $ (20.1 ) Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 19.6 $ 20.4 Owned and Operated Mines Segment Shipments - owned and operated mines (tons) 12.3 14.0 Realized price per ton sold $ 12.20 $ 12.10 Average cost per ton sold $ 10.94 $ 9.87 Cash margin per ton sold (2) $ 1.26 $ 2.23 Segment operating income (loss) $ 1.2 $ 10.6 Segment Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 18.6 $ 33.7 Logistics and Related Activities Segment Shipments - Asian exports (tons) 1.4 0.5 Realized price per ton sold - Asian exports $ 57.13 $ 49.53 Average cost per ton sold - Asian exports $ 52.09 $ 55.67 Cash margin per ton sold - Asian exports (2) $ 5.04 $ (6.14 ) Segment operating income (loss) $ 5.4 $ (7.4 ) Segment Adjusted EBITDA (1) $ 7.1 $ (2.6 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 7.3 $ 11.0 (1)\nNon-GAAP financial measure; see definition and reconciliation in this release and the attached tables.\n(2)\nCalculated by subtracting the average cost per ton sold from the realized price per ton sold.\nShipments of 12.3 million tons during compared to 14.0 million tons for the first quarter of 2017. Exported 1.4 million tons during the first quarter and have contracted 3.3 million tons for 2018 delivery at prices higher than those realized in 2017. JERA Trading exercised its option to increase volumes by 20 percent under the previously announced long-term agreement for the supply of coal to two new coal-fired integrated gasification combined cycle plants being developed in the Fukushima Prefecture in Japan. Shipments are expected to commence as early as the end of 2019 and continue for up to forty months, reaching up to 1.3 million tons in the final contract year. Net loss was $7.7 million for compared with a $20.1 million net loss during the first quarter of 2017, which was primarily driven by the slow start-up of export sales and high demurrage costs experienced in early 2017, partially offset by weak domestic shipments and the previously disclosed higher cash costs during . Adjusted EBITDA of $19.6 million during compared to $20.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. The current period included a $4.4 million mark-to-market credit to general and administrative costs related to the 2016 performance share unit grant revaluation. Ended the quarter with $127.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, up $19.9 million during the period. Total available liquidity of $527.8 million, including the undrawn $400 million Credit Agreement. The Company intends to extend or replace the Credit Agreement before its maturity in February 2019 and currently expects that any replacement facility will be significantly smaller than the current Credit Agreement. Further reduced surety bond requirements at Cordero Rojo Mine by approximately $13 million.\nHealth, Safety, and Environment\nDuring , among the Company’s approximately 1,150 full-time, mine site employees, there were no reportable injuries. The year-to-date Mine Safety and Health Administration (“MSHA”) All Injury Frequency Rate (“AIFR”) is zero compared to a rate of 0.34 in the first quarter of 2017. During the 58 MSHA inspector days at the mine sites during the quarter, the Company was issued one significant and substantial citation with the assessment totaling $638.\nThere were no reportable environmental incidents during the quarter.\nOperating Results\nOwned and Operated Mines\nThe Owned and Operated Mines segment comprises the results of mine site sales from the Company’s three mines primarily to its domestic utility customers and to the Logistics and Related Activities segment.\nQuarter Ended (in millions, except per ton amounts) 03/31/18 03/31/17 Tons sold 12.3 14.0 Revenue $ 153.7 $ 173.6 Cost of product sold $ 136.0 $ 140.4 Realized price per ton sold $ 12.20 $ 12.10 Average cost per ton $ 10.94 $ 9.87 Cash margin per ton sold (1) $ 1.26 $ 2.23 Segment operating income (loss) $ 1.2 $ 10.6 Segment Adjusted EBITDA (2) $ 18.6 $ 33.7 (1)\nCalculated by subtracting the average cost per ton sold from the realized price per ton sold.\n(2)\nNon-GAAP financial measure; see definition and reconciliation in this release and the attached tables.\nShipments during were 12 percent lower than the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to lower shipments at the Antelope and Cordero Rojo mines, partially offset by increased sales at Spring Creek due to higher export demand. With natural gas prices averaging approximately $2.75 per MMBtu, coal-fired power plants continued to run during and drew down PRB coal inventories to approximately 66 million tons at the end of March 2018, a decline of 9 million tons from December 2017 levels.\nRevenue from the Owned and Operated Mines segment decreased 11 percent in compared to the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to lower shipments, partially offset by $0.10 per ton higher average realized prices. Shipments were lower in due to the atypical shipping patterns experienced in 2017. Specifically, domestic shipments were only slightly lower during the first half of 2017 compared with the latter half of 2017 when, historically, the second half of the year shipments are significantly stronger. Cost per ton was $10.94 for compared with $9.87 for the first quarter of 2017. The higher cost per ton in 2018 was primarily driven by lower production rates, previously disclosed increased strip ratios, and higher per ton fuel and lube costs due to an increase in the price of diesel.\nLogistics and Related Activities\nThe Logistics and Related Activities segment comprises the results of the Company’s logistics and transportation services to its domestic and international export customers including the incremental production taxes and royalties associated with these sales.\nQuarter Ended (in millions, except per ton amounts) 03/31/18 03/31/17 Total tons delivered 1.4 0.6 Asian exports (tons) 1.4 0.5 Domestic (tons) (1) — 0.1 Revenue $ 79.6 $ 28.2 Total cost of product sold $ 74.2 $ 35.7 Asian Exports (per ton sold) Realized price $ 57.13 $ 49.53 Average cost $ 52.09 $ 55.67 Cash margin (2) $ 5.04 $ (6.14 ) Domestic (per ton sold) Realized price $ 35.61 $ 46.42 Average cost $ 30.82 $ 42.43 Cash margin (2) $ 4.79 $ 3.99 Segment operating income (loss) $ 5.4 $ (7.4 ) Segment Adjusted EBITDA (3) $ 7.1 $ (2.6 ) Note: Due to the tabular presentation of rounded amounts, certain numbers reflect insignificant rounding differences.\n(1)\nFor the period ending March 31, 2018, the domestic logistics volumes were 43,800 tons.\n(2)\nCalculated by subtracting the average cost per ton sold from the realized price per ton sold.\n(3)\nNon-GAAP financial measure; see definition and reconciliation in this release and the attached tables.\nStrong Asian utility demand and current pricing allowed the Company to export 1.4 million tons during . First quarter 2018 segment operating income was $5.4 million, as compared to a loss of $7.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. The 2018 first quarter reflects the shipment of 1.4 million tons in 11 vessels. This compares with 0.5 million tons of exports in 5 vessels for the first quarter of 2017 coupled with unusually high demurrage charges during the ramp up as the Company resumed export shipments. Segment operating income (loss) includes amortization of logistics contract amendment payments settled in the previous year. With the previously disclosed logistics contract extensions, this non-cash amortization will reduce but continue to the end of the extended logistics agreements in December 2020.\nCash, Liquidity, and Financial Position\nCash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018 were $127.8 million. During the first quarter, the cash generated by operations totaled $24.1 million, while capital expenditures were $3.0 million. The Company had $23.0 million in undrawn letters of credit under its A/R Securitization Program as of March 31, 2018. The available capacity under the A/R Securitization was $19.9 million at the end of the first quarter, which resulted in a required cash-collateralization of the $3.1 million difference. These letters of credit are currently being used to provide collateral for the Company’s reclamation bonds.\nAt March 31, 2018, the borrowing capacity under the $400 million Credit Agreement was fully available. Including cash on hand and the availability under the A/R Securitization and Credit Agreement, the Company ended the quarter with total available liquidity of $527.8 million. The Company intends to extend or replace the Credit Agreement before its maturity in February 2019 and expects that any replacement facility will be significantly smaller than the current Credit Agreement.\nThe recently enacted tax legislation, commonly referred to as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (“TCJA”), made significant changes to U.S. tax laws. The immediate material impact of TCJA to the Company is the elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”), and the ability to offset regular tax liability or claim refunds for taxable years 2018 through 2021 for AMT credits carried forward from prior periods. The Company currently anticipates it will realize approximately $30 million in AMT value over the next four years with approximately half of this value realized in 2019 for taxable year 2018.\nDomestic Outlook\nMine shipments to domestic customers during were 10.8 million tons, as compared to 12.5 million tons shipped to domestic customers in the fourth quarter of 2017. Shipments during declined as customers focused on reducing their coal inventories. Cloud Peak Energy has worked with its customers to move a higher proportion of 2018 contracted volumes to the first half of the year. This has resulted in an open position in the second half of the year that the Company expects to fill through new sales as the year progresses.\nNatural gas prices remained above $3.00 per MMBtu for most of but have since declined to around $2.75 per MMBtu for May delivery. Despite a significant decline in storage volumes, natural gas prices declined as a result of increased production and stabilized demand. As of April 6, 2018, U.S. Energy Information Administration data showed that natural gas inventories have declined by 35.2 percent, compared to year ago levels.\nEnergy Ventures Analysis estimates there were 66 million tons of PRB coal inventories on utility stockpiles at the end of March 2018, a decline of nine million tons from December 2017 levels. The Company believes customer inventories will increase slightly over the next few months, and once the summer cooling season begins, further coal purchases will occur.\nHistorically, the Company’s core cash mining costs, excluding royalties, production taxes, and fuel, have increased as a result of increasing strip ratios and haul distances. Strip ratios increase as coal seams naturally deepen and require additional overburden removal, which is common in the PRB. Haul distances increase as mining pits progress further from the load-out. For 2018, and as previously discussed, the Company’s mine plans indicate that the strip ratio will increase more than recent years resulting in higher costs. Lower volumes are expected from the Cordero Rojo Mine in 2018, partially offset by increased volumes at Spring Creek Mine due to higher export demand. These anticipated higher costs and lower volumes will reduce the contribution from the Owned and Operated Mines segment in 2018.\nFor 2018, the Company plans to ship between 52 and 56 million tons, with current commitments to sell 47 million tons, which includes 3.3 million tons contracted with export customers. All of the 47 million tons are under fixed-price contracts with a weighted-average price of $12.28 per ton. The approximately 2.0 million tons for 2018 that were priced during averaged $11.83 per ton, in line with prevailing prices at that time for the qualities of coal contracted.\nThe Company is contracted to sell 24 million tons in 2019. Of this committed production, 17 million tons are under fixed-price contracts with a weighted-average price of $12.63 per ton. For 2019, there were minimal tons contracted during .\nInternational Outlook\nThe international thermal Newcastle coal price index has recently declined from over $100 per tonne, currently settling around $90 per tonne as the end of winter reduced near-term demand. Based on estimates through February 2018, thermal imports into China have increased 11 million tonnes, or almost 40 percent, to start the year. Cold weather led to China’s electricity generation increasing by 10 percent in the first quarter, following a full year 2017 increase of nearly 7 percent. Coal-fired generation increased 8.7 percent during , fueling strong import demand. In South Korea, thermal imports declined by 1 million tonnes or 5 percent through February 2018. Estimates for 2018 have total imports into South Korea increasing by 5 million tonnes on increasing utilization of existing plants along with new plants coming on line.\nThe Company exported 1.4 million tons during the first quarter 2018. Good performance by the mine, rail, and port allowed the Company to export targeted volumes for the quarter. Although pricing has recently declined as winter ended, it is expected to recover as summer electricity demand increases. Pricing and demand remain favorable for Cloud Peak Energy coal, and the Company expects export shipments of 5.5 million tons in 2018. The Company has sold 3.3 million tons for delivery in 2018. The higher expected export volumes and pricing are anticipated to partially offset the lower expected contribution from the Owned and Operated mines.\n2018 Guidance – Financial and Operational Estimates\n“First quarter shipments declined compared to last year as utilities reduced their coal stockpiles. Customers are taking their contracted volumes, and we expect to sell our remaining open 2018 volumes during the year. International markets remain strong and interest for our Spring Creek product remains high. Our logistics export partners have been moving our contracted volumes, leaving us on track to export 5.5 million tons in 2018,” commented Marshall.\nThe following table provides the current outlook and assumptions for selected 2018 consolidated financial and operational metrics:\nEstimate or Estimated Range Coal shipments for the three mines (1) 52 – 56 million tons Committed sales with fixed prices Approximately 47 million tons Anticipated realized price of produced coal with fixed prices Approximately $12.28 per ton Adjusted EBITDA (2) $75 – $100 million Net interest expense Approximately $37 million Cash interest paid Approximately $42 million Depreciation, depletion, amortization, and accretion $75 – $85 million Capital expenditures $15 – $25 million (1)\nInclusive of intersegment sales.\n(2)\nNon-GAAP financial measure; please see definition below in this release.

We make forward-looking statements based on currently available information, and we assume no obligation to, and expressly disclaim any obligation to, update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements made in this release or our related quarterly investor presentation, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis release and our related presentation include the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA (on a consolidated basis and for our reporting segments). Adjusted EBITDA is intended to provide additional information only and does not have any standard meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). Quantitative reconciliations of historical net income (loss) and segment operating income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA are found in the tables accompanying this release. EBITDA represents net income (loss) before: (1) interest income (expense), net, (2) income tax provision, (3) depreciation and depletion, and (4) amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted for accretion, which represents non-cash increases in asset retirement obligation liabilities resulting from the passage of time, and specifically identified items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. For the periods presented herein, the specifically identified items are: (1) adjustments to exclude non-cash impairment charges, (2) adjustments for derivative financial instruments, excluding fair value mark-to-market gains or losses and including cash amounts received or paid, (3) adjustments to exclude debt restructuring costs, and (4) non-cash throughput amortization expense and contract termination payments made to amend the BNSF and Westshore agreements. We enter into certain derivative financial instruments such as put options that require the payment of premiums at contract inception. The reduction in the premium value over time is reflected in the mark-to-market gains or losses. Our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA does not include premiums paid for derivative financial instruments; either at contract inception, as these payments pertain to future settlement periods, or in the period of contract settlement, as the payment occurred in a preceding period. In prior years the amortization of port and rail contract termination payments were included as part of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because the cash payments approximated the amount of amortization being taken during the year. During 2017, management determined that the non-cash portion of amortization arising from payments made in prior years, as well as the amortization of contract termination payments, should be adjusted out of Adjusted EBITDA because the ongoing cash payments are now significantly smaller than the overall amortization of these payments and no longer reflect the transactional results. Because of the inherent uncertainty related to the items identified above, management does not believe it is able to provide a meaningful forecast of the comparable GAAP measures or reconciliation to any forecasted GAAP measure.\nAdjusted EBITDA is an additional tool intended to assist our management in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items that management believes do not directly reflect our core operations. Adjusted EBITDA is a metric intended to assist management in evaluating operating performance, comparing performance across periods, planning and forecasting future business operations and helping determine levels of operating and capital investments. Period-to-period comparisons of Adjusted EBITDA are intended to help our management identify and assess additional trends potentially impacting our company that may not be shown solely by period-to-period comparisons of net income (loss) or segment operating income (loss). Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is also used as part of our incentive compensation program for our executive officers and others.\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors, analysts, and other external users of our Consolidated Financial Statements in evaluating our operating performance from period to period and comparing our performance to similar operating results of other relevant companies. Adjusted EBITDA allows investors to measure a company’s operating performance without regard to items such as interest expense, taxes, depreciation and depletion, amortization and accretion and other specifically identified items that are not considered to directly reflect our core operations.\nOur management recognizes that using Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure has inherent limitations as compared to net income (loss), segment operating income (loss), or other GAAP financial measures, as this non-GAAP measure excludes certain items, including items that are recurring in nature, which may be meaningful to investors. As a result of these exclusions, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation and does not purport to be an alternative to net income (loss), segment operating income (loss), or other GAAP financial measures as a measure of our operating performance. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nCLOUD PEAK ENERGY INC.
