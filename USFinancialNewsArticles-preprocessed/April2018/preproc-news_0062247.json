    "text": "0 COMMENTS JAKARTA, Indonesia—Indonesia is reappointing JPMorgan Chase JPM -0.57% & Co. as a primary dealer of government bonds almost a year and a half after the U.S. bank was kicked out of the business over a negative research report.\nThe finance ministry said in a statement Monday that America’s largest bank by assets would be a primary dealer again beginning May 2 along with 19 other banks and financial institutions. It didn’t give a reason for the reinstatement. The ministry had previously said the bank would be eligible to reapply after 12 months of sitting out.\n“There are a lot of requirements, including ensuring there is no conflict of interests,” said Scenaider Siahaan, director of financing strategy and portfolio at the ministry’s Directorate General of Budget Financing and Risk Management. He didn’t elaborate.\n“Our focus is on our clients and we believe a primary dealer license will strengthen our ability to service our clients who invest in Indonesia more effectively,” the bank said.\nThe ministry cut business ties with JPMorgan in January 2017, saying that a research report by the bank that downgraded Indonesian equities in November 2016 wasn’t credible and could destabilize the financial system in this trillion-dollar economy.\nThat meant the bank could no longer serve as a primary dealer for the government’s rupiah bonds nor underwrite the ministry’s global offerings. The dealer role gave JPMorgan important visibility into the much larger business of matching buyers and sellers of Indonesian government debt and currency. The bank was still able to trade government bonds and the rupiah and to underwrite stock and debt for private companies.\nShortly after being kicked off the Indonesia business, J.P. Morgan upgraded its assessment of Indonesia stocks. Since then, the bank hasn’t issued a downgrade report on Indonesian equities or bonds, a person with knowledge of the reports said.\nThe lead analyst of the November 2016 report no longer works for the bank.\nIndonesia went on to revise rules for primary dealers, saying banks had a duty to uphold the country’s interests—interpreted by many in the industry as a veiled warning not to issue negative research reports. Indonesia has said it is open to negative assessments as long as they are substantiated.\n—I Made Sentana contributed to this article.\nWrite to Ben Otto at ben.otto@wsj.com",
