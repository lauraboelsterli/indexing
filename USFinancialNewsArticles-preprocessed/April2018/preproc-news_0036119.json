    "text": "HOUSTON, April 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Exterran Corporation (NYSE:EXTN) (“Exterran” or the “Company”) today announced the sale of its North American production equipment (PEQ) assets. An Asset Purchase Agreement (APA) was signed April 16, 2018 with Titan Production Equipment Acquisition, LLC (“Titan”), a newly-formed company backed by an affiliate of Castle Harlan, Inc., the New York private equity firm. The sale is expected to close in the summer of 2018 and will not have a material financial impact to Exterran.\nThe sale allows Exterran to accelerate its growth strategy by focusing as a systems and process Company for oil, gas, water and power. The Company will continue to manufacture production equipment outside of North America. In addition, Exterran will continue to offer its customers complete solutions in gas gathering, processing and compression, including offering production equipment in North America through Titan.\nIncluded in the sale is Exterran’s 80-acre manufacturing facility in Columbus, Texas.\nExterran welcomes its partnership with Titan as the preferred supplier of production equipment to meet the Company’s needs in North America.\nAbout Exterran Corporation\nExterran Corporation (NYSE:EXTN) is a global systems and process company offering solutions in the oil, gas, water and power markets. We are a market leader in natural gas processing and treatment and compression products and services, providing critical midstream infrastructure solutions to customers throughout the world.

These statements may include words such as “guidance,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “project,” “plan,” “intend,” “believe,” “confident,” “may,” “should,” “can have,” “likely,” “future” and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operating or financial performance or other events. Examples of forward-looking information in this release include, but are not limited to: Exterran’s financial and operational strategies and ability to successfully effect those strategies; Exterran’s expectations regarding future economic and market conditions; Exterran’s financial and operational outlook and ability to fulfill that outlook; demand for Exterran’s products and services and growth opportunities for those products and services; and statements regarding industry activity levels and infrastructure build-out opportunities.\nThese forward-looking statements rely on a number of assumptions concerning future events and are subject to a number of uncertainties and factors, many of which are outside Exterran’s control, which could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements. As a result, any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results. While Exterran believes that the assumptions concerning future events are reasonable, it cautions that there are inherent difficulties in predicting certain important factors that could impact the future performance or results of its business. Among the factors that could cause results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements are: local, regional, national and international economic conditions and the impact they may have on Exterran and its customers; Exterran’s reduced profit margins or loss of market share resulting from competition or the introduction of competing technologies by other companies; Exterran’s ability to secure new oil and gas product sales customers; conditions in the oil and gas industry, including a sustained imbalance in the level of supply or demand for oil or natural gas or a sustained low price of oil or natural gas; Exterran’s ability to timely and cost-effectively execute projects; Exterran enhancing its asset utilization, particularly with respect to its fleet of compressors; Exterran’s ability to integrate acquired businesses; employment and workforce factors, including the ability to hire, train and retain key employees; Exterran’s ability to accurately estimate costs and time required under Exterran’s fixed price contracts; liability related to the use of Exterran’s products and services; changes in political or economic conditions in key operating markets, including international markets; changes in current exchange rates, including the risk of currency devaluations by foreign governments, and restrictions on currency repatriation; risks associated with Exterran’s operations, such as equipment defects, equipment malfunctions and natural disasters; any non-performance by third parties of their contractual obligations, including the financial condition of our customers; changes in safety, health, environmental and other regulations; the effectiveness of Exterran’s internal controls going forward, including the existence of any control deficiencies identified in the future; the results of governmental actions relating to pending investigations, including Exterran’s pending Securities and Exchange Commission investigation; the results of any shareholder actions relating to the restatement of Exterran’s financial statements; the effect of the agreements related to Exterran’s spin-off, and the anticipated effects of restructuring its business; and Exterran’s indebtedness and its ability to fund its operations, capital commitments and other contractual cash obligations, including our debt obligations.\nThese forward-looking statements are also affected by the risk factors, forward-looking statements and challenges and uncertainties described in Exterran’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission available on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website www.sec.gov . A discussion of these risks is expressly incorporated by reference into this release. Except as required by law, Exterran expressly disclaims any intention or obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nFor information, contact:\nInvestors - Greg Rosenstein, 281-854-3199\nMedia - George Smalley, 281-854-3163\nSource:Exterran Corporation",
