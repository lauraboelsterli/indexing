    "text": "BROOKWOOD, Ala.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Warrior Met Coal (NYSE: HCC) today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share to be paid on May 11, 2018, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 4, 2018.\nWarrior Met Coal is a large-scale, low-cost U.S. based producer and exporter of premium hard coking coal (“HCC”) operating highly efficient longwall operations in its underground mines located in Alabama. The HCC that Warrior Met Coal produces from the Blue Creek coal seam contains very low sulfur and has strong coking properties, and is of a similar quality to coal referred to as the premium HCC produced in Australia. The premium nature of Warrior Met Coal’s HCC makes it ideally suited as a base feed coal for steel makers and results in price realizations near the quarterly Australian Premium Low-Volatility HCC index average price. Warrior Met Coal sells all of its met coal production to steel producers in Europe, South America and Asia.
