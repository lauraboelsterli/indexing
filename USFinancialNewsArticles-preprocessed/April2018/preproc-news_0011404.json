Television replays showed Proud appearing to move on the blocks. 0110 OLEKSIAK GRIEVING OVER GRANDMOTHER \nCanada’s Penny Oleksiak, whose grandmother died on Wednesday, advanced to the women’s 200m freestyle final as competition at the pool began. The Rio Olympics 100m freestyle champion was sixth fastest behind Australia’s Ariarne Titmus. \nScotland’s two-times 400 individual medley champion Hannah Miley was almost a second faster than the rest of the field in qualifying for Thursday’s final, while Rio Olympics champion Mack Horton was the fastest in the men’s 400m freestyle. 0030 DUFFY WINS FIRST GOLD OF GAMES \nBermuda’s Flora Duffy won the first gold medal of the Commonwealth Games, and her country’s first since Auckland in 1990, when she stormed to victory in the women’s triathlon. \nThe two-time world champion powered away in the run after sticking to England’s Jessica Learmonth in the swim and cycling legs of the race, which was a sprint event rather than over the traditional Olympic distances. \n0010 PEARSON TO WITHDRAW - REPORT \nAustralia’s Sally Pearson, the 2012 London Olympics hurdles champion, is expected to withdraw from competition due to a nagging Achilles injury, host broadcaster Channel 7 reported. \nPearson, who was the final bearer of the Queen’s Baton Relay at the opening ceremony, has called a media conference at 1 p.m. (0300 GMT). 2300 COMPETITION KICKS OFF \nThe morning after a well-received opening ceremony at Carrara Stadium, artistic gymnastics, badminton and lawn bowls events started in brilliant sunshine with forecast temperature of 28 degrees Celsius.
