FILE PHOTO: Activists of Egyutt (Together) opposition party removes a government billboard displaying George Soros in monochrome next to a message urning Hungarians to take part in a national consultation about what it calls a plan by the Hungarian-born financier to settle a million migrants in Europe per year, in Budapest, Hungary, October 5, 2017. REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo/File Photo \nHungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has blamed Soros, a Hungarian-born U.S. financier, for a host of ills and pushed through legislation cracking down on non-governmental organizations called the “Stop Soros” laws which drew international criticism. \nThe Hungarian news web site 444.hu said the Open Society Foundations office would shut down by Aug. 31 and move first to Vienna then on to Berlin. \nReuters was not been able to immediately reach the Open Society Foundations either in Budapest or New York.
