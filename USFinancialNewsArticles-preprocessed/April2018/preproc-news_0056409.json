    "text": "0 COMMENTS Viacom ’s VIAB -0.67% “Jersey Shore” reboot reached nearly 10 million viewers over its premier weekend. “A Quiet Place,” the horror flick produced and released by a new team at Paramount Pictures, grossed more than $50 million domestically in its first weekend. Upcoming projects include a Tyler Perry film and an adaptation of Trevor Noah’s book, “Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood.”\nProspects at Viacom are looking up—with or without a CBS deal.\nThe company reported second-quarter revenue of $3.15 billion on earnings of 64 cents a share. That is a 3% revenue decrease from the same period last year, but it still exceeds analysts’ expectations of $3.03 billion. Shares rose nearly 4% in recent Wednesday trading.\nIn a call with analysts, Chief Executive Bob Bakish said that the company is pivoting from stabilization and revitalization to growth. Advertising and affiliate revenue are still declining, though less than they were a few quarters ago. Meanwhile, the international media networks saw double-digit revenue growth, and Paramount Pictures has returned to profitability. The company is forecasting $100 million in annual cost savings in 2018 and more than $300 million in 2019.\nYet none of this makes reaching a deal any easier. Viacom’s shareholders just have further reason to expect a premium, which CBS has appeared unwilling to offer . Indeed, if Viacom is doing as well as it says, perhaps both companies will be better off going their separate ways.\n“I’m not sure why you shotgun a marriage between these two companies if Viacom is as confident as it seems,” says Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson.\nShari Redstone, president of National Amusements, the holding company that controls both companies, might need to resort to a damaging ouster of CBS boss Les Moonves to effect a merger. That radical move might not be the wisest course of action now that Viacom is bouncing back.\nWrite to Elizabeth Winkler at elizabeth.winkler@wsj.com",
