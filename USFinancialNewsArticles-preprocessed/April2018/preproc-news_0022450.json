    "text": "A slump in the prices of Russian assets after the United States imposed sanctions on a group of Russian tycoons is partly driven by emotion and there will be a correction, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday.\nSpeaking on a regular conference call, Peskov said: \"There have indeed been strong negative trends on the market. Partly that is to do with market trends, partly it's to do with the emotional fallout (from the sanctions). There will subsequently be a correction.\"",
