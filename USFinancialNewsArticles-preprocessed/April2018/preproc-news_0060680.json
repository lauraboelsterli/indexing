Soccer Football - Serie A - Inter Milan vs Juventus - San Siro, Milan, Italy - April 28, 2018 Juventus' Juan Cuadrado in action with Inter Milan's Rafinha REUTERS/Alberto Lingria\nJuve’s win took them four points clear of rivals Napoli, who visit Fiorentina on Sunday, and ensured they will finish the weekend top of the table with three matches to play.\nDouglas Costa put Juventus ahead after 13 minutes and Inter were in more trouble when midfielder Matias Vecino was dismissed five minutes later, a decision made with the help of the video assistant referee (VAR). Slideshow (11 Images)\nAgainst all the odds, Inter turned the game around as Mauro Icardi equalised shortly after halftime and veteran Juventus defender Andrea Barzagli turned Ivan Perisic’s low cross into his own net.\nJuve were facing a dramatic defeat until they levelled with three minutes left from a Juan Cuadrado shot that deflected off defender Milan Skriniar. Gonzalo Higuain headed the winner in the 89th minute. Writing by Brian Homewood in Bern; Editing by Christian Radnedge",
