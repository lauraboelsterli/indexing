    "text": "UPDATE 1-FDA cracks down on sales of Juul tobacco products to minors Published 10 Hours Ago Reuters \n(Adds FDA statement details, background and company's response) \nApril 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday said it launched a crackdown to curb the sale to minors of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products developed by Juul Labs Inc. \nThe regulator said https://bit.ly/2qUJYff it had issued 40 warning letters to retailers, including multiple 7-Eleven stores, for violations regarding illegal sales of Juul products, after uncovering violations through compliance checks since the beginning of March. \n\"The FDA has been conducting a large-scale, undercover nationwide blitz to crack down on the sale of e-cigarettes specifically Juul products to minors at both brick-and-mortar and online retailers,\" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement. \nJuul Labs, launched in 2015, brands its products as an alternative for adult smokers. The San Francisco, California-headquartered firm offers a number of products designed for tobacco as an alternative to ordinary cigarettes, including e-cigarettes and vaporizers. \nJuul in a statement said it agreed \"with the FDA that illegal sales of our product to minors is unacceptable\" and would announce \"more aggressive plans\" regarding the violations in the coming days. \nThe FDA also said eBay Inc removed several listings of Juul products after the regulator raised concerns.
