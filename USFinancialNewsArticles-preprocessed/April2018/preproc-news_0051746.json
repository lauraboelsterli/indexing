    "text": "ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran’s supreme leader called on Muslim nations to unite against the United States, saying Tehran would never yield to “bullying,” state television reported on Thursday.\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei gestures during a meeting with religious poets in Tehran, Iran, March 8, 2018. Leader.ir/Handout via REUTERS/Files “The Iranian nation has successfully resisted bullying attempts by America and other arrogant powers and we will continue to resist... All Muslim nations should stand united against America and other enemies,” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said.\nIran’s top authority criticised Trump for saying on Tuesday some countries in the Middle East “wouldn’t last a week” without U.S. protection.\n“Such remarks are humiliation for Muslims ... Unfortunately there is war in our region between Muslim countries. The backward governments of some Muslim countries are fighting with other countries,” Khamenei said.\nIran and Saudi Arabia have long been locked in a proxy war, competing for regional supremacy from Iraq to Syria and Lebanon to Yemen.\nWriting by Parisa Hafezi; Editing by Janet Lawrence\n ",
