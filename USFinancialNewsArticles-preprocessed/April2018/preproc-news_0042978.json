Canada's annual inflation rate in March edged up to 2.3 percent from 2.2 percent in February, the highest level in more than three years, Statistics Canada said. Still, it was less than the 2.4 percent forecast by analysts, while the Bank of Canada's three measures of core inflation were little changed. \"The markets are a little bit disappointed because the numbers are softer than anticipated.\" said Derek Holt, head of capital economics at Scotiabank. \"But to me, it still keeps May in play for the Bank of Canada.\" The central bank left its benchmark interest rate on hold at 1.25 percent on Wednesday and said it did not know when or how aggressive it would need to be to keep inflation in check. Chances of an interest rate hike in May were little changed at 35 percent after the data, the overnight index swaps market showed. In separate data, Canadian retail sales grew by 0.4 percent in February as higher sales at auto dealerships and general merchandise stores outweighed widespread weakness in other sectors, Statistics Canada said. Analysts had expected a 0.3 percent gain. At 9:24 a.m. EDT (1324 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading 0.4 percent lower at C$1.2717 to the greenback, or 78.63 U.S. cents. The currency touched its weakest level since April 9 at C$1.2718. The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, fell on Friday after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and said oil prices were artificially high. U.S. crude prices were down 0.4 percent at $68.03 a barrel. Canadian government bond prices were mixed across a steeper yield curve, with the two-year up 3.4 Canadian cents to yield 1.921 percent and the 10-year falling 5 Canadian cents to yield 2.327 percent. The gap between Canada's 2-year yield and its U.S. counterpart widened by 2.2 basis points to a spread of -52.0 basis points. (Reporting by Fergal Smith; Editing by David Gregorio)\n ",
