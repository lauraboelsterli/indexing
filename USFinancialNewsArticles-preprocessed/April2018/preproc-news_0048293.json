The Company reported net income of $30.2 million, or $0.63 earnings per diluted share. Excluding special items, adjusted earnings per diluted share was $0.60 in the quarter.\n“Our third quarter results highlight the continued momentum in our business as we successfully execute our strategy to capitalize on rising market demand trends across our portfolio, unlock incremental capacity through the Carpenter Operating Model, and strategically invest in our business to drive long-term, sustainable growth,” said Tony Thene, Carpenter’s President and CEO. “Our commercial team is making additional progress penetrating our end-use markets, and we are gaining market share from current and new customers who recognize the value of our high-end specialty alloys and solutions-focused approach.”\n“We drove sequential revenue gains across all of our end-use markets during the third quarter, with three delivering double digit growth. We are continuing to benefit from solid demand in our Aerospace and Defense end-use market, where we generated healthy sequential growth across all sub-markets. We are also seeing positive momentum from the ongoing recovery in the oil & gas sub-market and continued strong demand for our titanium solutions in the Medical end-use market.”\n“As we add to our growing backlog and gain market share, we remain focused on driving continual improvement in our manufacturing processes through the implementation of the Carpenter Operating Model. We also continue to invest for the long-term by strengthening our capabilities in core growth areas including additive manufacturing. The acquisition of CalRAM provides direct entry into the rapidly expanding part production segment of the additive manufacturing value chain and builds upon our existing metallurgical processing and materials expertise. The combination of CalRAM’s production capabilities and our existing additive manufacturing assets, will allow us to provide customers the optimal solution consisting of the right part made with the right material to meet their demanding application needs. The investments we are making in advanced solutions like additive manufacturing and soft magnetics are integral to delivering the critical applications that will define the future of our industry and secure our long-term growth trajectory.”\nFinancial Highlights\n($ in millions) Q3 Q3 Q2 FY2018 FY2017 FY2018 Net Sales $ 572.2 $ 473.6 $ 487.8 Net Sales Excluding Surcharge (a) $ 472.5 $ 412.9 $ 415.5 Operating Income $ 45.2 $ 35.8 $ 40.8 Operating Income Excluding Pension EID (a) $ 45.7 $ 41.4 $ 41.3 Net Income $ 30.2 $ 20.7 $ 92.1 Cash Provided from Operating Activities $ 73.4 $ 61.7 $ 24.7 Free Cash Flow (a) $ 34.5 $ 6.1 $ (10.7 ) Non-GAAP financial measure explained in attached schedules Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 were $572.2 million compared with $473.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, an increase of $98.6 million (or 20.8 percent), on 8.9 percent higher volume. Net sales excluding surcharge were $472.5 million, an increase of $59.6 million (or 14.4 percent) from the same period a year ago.\nOperating income was $45.2 million compared to $35.8 million in the prior year period. Operating income—excluding pension earnings, interest and deferrals (EID)—was $45.7 million, compared to $41.4 million in the prior year period. These results primarily reflect stronger market conditions driving increased product demand compared to the same quarter a year ago.\nCash provided from operating activities in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 was $73.4 million, compared to $61.7 million in the same quarter last year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily related to the reduction in inventory in the current quarter of $40.5 million compared with an inventory increase of $14.9 million in the same quarter a year ago. The inventory reduction was partially offset by increasing accounts receivable driven by higher sales in the current quarter.\nFree cash flow in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 was $34.5 million, compared to $6.1 million in the same quarter last year. Capital expenditures were $25.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to $18.0 million in the same quarter last year.\nTotal liquidity, including cash and available revolver balance, was $440.8 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2018. This consisted of $46.8 million of cash and $394.0 million of available borrowings under the Company’s credit facility.\nConference Call and Webcast Presentation\nCarpenter will host a conference call and webcast presentation today, April 26 th at 10:00 a.m. ET, to discuss the financial results of operations for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018.

45.2 $ 35.8 $ 127.7 $ 52.6 The Company has two reportable segments, Specialty Alloys Operations (“SAO”) and Performance Engineered Products (“PEP”).\nThe SAO segment is comprised of Carpenter’s major premium alloy and stainless steel manufacturing operations. This includes operations performed at mills primarily in Reading and Latrobe, Pennsylvania and surrounding areas as well as South Carolina and Alabama.\nThe PEP segment is comprised of the Company’s differentiated operations. This segment includes the Dynamet titanium business, the Carpenter Powder Products (CPP) business, the Amega West business, the CalRAM business and the Latrobe and Mexico distribution businesses. The businesses in the PEP segment are managed with an entrepreneurial structure to promote flexibility and agility to quickly respond to market dynamics. It is our belief this model will ultimately drive overall revenue and profit growth. The pounds sold data above for the PEP segment includes only the Dynamet and CPP businesses.\nCorporate costs are comprised of executive and director compensation, and other corporate facilities and administrative expenses not allocated to the segments. Also included are items that management considers not representative of ongoing operations and other specifically-identified income or expense items.\nThe service cost component of net pension expense, which represents the estimated cost of future pension liabilities earned associated with active employees, is included in the operating results of the business segments. The residual net pension expense, or pension earnings, interest and deferrals (pension EID), is comprised of the expected return on plan assets, interest costs on the projected benefit obligations of the plans, and amortization of actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs and is included under the heading \"Pension earnings, interest and deferrals.\"\nPRELIMINARY NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (in millions, except per share data) (Unaudited) OPERATING MARGIN EXCLUDING SURCHARGE, PENSION EARNINGS, INTEREST AND DEFERRALS Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended AND SPECIAL ITEMS March 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net sales $ 572.2 $ 473.6 $ 1,539.7 $ 1,289.9 Less: surcharge 99.7 60.7 241.9 170.4 Net sales excluding surcharge $ 472.5 $ 412.9 $ 1,297.8 $ 1,119.5 Operating income $ 45.2 $ 35.8 $ 127.7 $ 52.6 Pension earnings, interest and deferrals 0.5 5.6 1.6 18.2 Operating income excluding pension earnings, interest and deferrals 45.7 41.4 129.3 70.8 Special items: Pension curtailment charge — — — 0.5 Operating income excluding pension earnings, interest and deferrals and special items $ 45.7 $ 41.4 $ 129.3 $ 71.3 Operating margin 7.9 % 7.6 % 8.3 % 4.1 % Operating margin excluding surcharge, pension earnings, interest and deferrals and special items 9.7 % 10.0 % 10.0 % 6.4 % Management believes that removing the impacts of raw material surcharge from operating margin provides a more consistent basis for comparing results of operations from period to period, thereby permitting management to evaluate performance and investors to make decisions based on the ongoing operations of the Company. In addition, management believes that excluding the impact of pension earnings, interest and deferrals, which may be volatile due to changes in the financial markets, is helpful in analyzing the true operating performance of the Company. Management also believes that removing the impact of the special items is helpful in analyzing the operating performance of the Company, as these costs are not indicative of ongoing operating performance. Management uses its results excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, the Company’s board of directors and others.\nADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS Income\nBefore\nIncome\nTaxes Income\nTax\nExpense Net\nIncome Earnings\nPer\nDiluted\nShare* Three months ended March 31, 2018, as reported $ 37.7 $ (7.5 ) $ 30.2 $ 0.63 Special items: Impact of US tax reform and other legislative changes — (1.6 ) (1.6 ) (0.03 ) Three months ended March 31, 2018, as adjusted $ 37.7 $ (9.1 ) $ 28.6 $ 0.60 * Impact per diluted share calculated using weighted average common shares outstanding of 47.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE EXCLUDING\nSPECIAL ITEMS Income\nBefore\nIncome\nTaxes Income\nTax\nExpense Net\nIncome Earnings\nPer\nDiluted\nShare* Three months ended March 31, 2017, as reported $ 29.1 $ (8.4 ) $ 20.7 $ 0.44 Special items: None reported — — — — Three months ended March 31, 2017, as adjusted $ 29.1 $ (8.4 ) $ 20.7 $ 0.44 * Impact per diluted share calculated using weighted average common shares outstanding of 47.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS Income\nBefore\nIncome\nTaxes Income\nTax\nBenefit\n(Expense) Net\nIncome Earnings\nPer\nDiluted\nShare** Nine months ended March 31, 2018, as reported $ 106.6 $ 39.1 $ 145.7 $ 3.04 Special items: Impact of US tax reform and other legislative changes — (67.6 ) (67.6 ) (1.41 ) Nine months ended March 31, 2018, as adjusted $ 106.6 $ (28.5 ) $ 78.1 $ 1.63 ** Impact per diluted share calculated using weighted average common shares outstanding of 47.5 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018.\nADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE EXCLUDING SPECIAL ITEMS Income\nBefore\nIncome Taxes Income\nTax\n(Expense)\nBenefit Net\nIncome Earnings\nPer\nDiluted\nShare** Nine months ended March 31, 2017, as reported $ 32.1 $ (10.6 ) $ 21.5 $ 0.45 Special items: Pension curtailment charge 0.5 (0.1 ) 0.4 0.01 Income tax item* — 2.1 2.1 0.04 Total impact of special items 0.5 2.0 2.5 0.05 Nine months ended March 31, 2017, as adjusted $ 32.6 $ (8.6 ) $ 24.0 $ 0.50 * Discrete income tax charge recorded as a result of reduced tax benefits claimed in prior years in connection with the Company’s decision to make a $100 million voluntary pension contribution in October 2016. ** Impact per diluted share calculated using weighted average common shares outstanding of 47.1 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. Management believes that earnings per share adjusted to exclude the impact of the special items is helpful in analyzing the operating performance of the Company, as these costs are not indicative of ongoing operating performance. Management uses its results excluding these amounts to evaluate its operating performance and to discuss its business with investment institutions, the Company’s board of directors and others.\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 31, March 31, FREE CASH FLOW 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net cash provided from operating activities $ 73.4 $ 61.7 $ 90.7 $ 36.3 Purchases of property, equipment and software (25.2 ) (18.0 ) (80.9 ) (63.1 ) Proceeds from disposals of property and equipment and assets held for sale 1.9 — 2.0 — Acquisition of businesses (13.3 ) (35.3 ) (13.3 ) (35.3 ) Proceeds from note receivable from the sale of equity method investment 6.3 6.3 6.3 6.3 Dividends paid (8.6 ) (8.6 ) (25.8 ) (25.6 ) Free cash flow $ 34.5 $ 6.1 $ (21.0 ) $ (81.4 ) Management believes that the free cash flow measure provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition because it is a measure of cash generated which management evaluates for alternative uses.\nPRELIMINARY SUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULES (in millions) (Unaudited) Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 31, March 31, NET SALES BY END-USE MARKET 2018 2017 2018 2017 End-Use Market Excluding Surcharge: Aerospace and Defense $ 260.5 $ 214.0 $ 696.5 $ 586.3 Energy 33.3 36.6 91.0 89.5 Transportation 33.9 31.3 94.2 90.5 Medical 37.6 31.6 108.2 79.7 Industrial and Consumer 72.2 66.7 214.0 185.2 Distribution 35.0 32.7 93.9 88.3 Total net sales excluding surcharge 472.5 412.9 1,297.8 1,119.5 Surcharge 99.7 60.7 241.9 170.4 Total net sales $ 572.2 $ 473.6 $ 1,539.7 $ 1,289.9\nMedia Inquiries:\nWilliam J.
