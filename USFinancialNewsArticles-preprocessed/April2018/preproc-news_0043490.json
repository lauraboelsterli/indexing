Its license for the field is set to expire in 2022. \nAuction winners are expected to be announced in December this year, he added. \nThe Erawan and Bongkot fields currently have combined output of 2.1 billion cubic feet a day of gas, government data shows. \nBidders in the Erawan field must invest at least $4 billion and bidders for the Bongkot field, $2 billion, Director-General of the Department of Mineral Fuels Veerasak Pungrassamee, said. \nPTT Exploration and Production, the upstream arm of state-owned energy company PTT, operates the Bongkot field under a license set to expire in 2023. \nPTTEP previously said it was negotiating a joint bid with Chevron and was prepared to bid for both fields on its own.
