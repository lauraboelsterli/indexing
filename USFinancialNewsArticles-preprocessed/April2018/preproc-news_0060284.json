    "text": "MARLBOROUGH, Mass., April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE: BSX) today announced the close of its acquisition of NxThera. The company developed the Rezūm ® system, a minimally invasive therapy (MIT) for patients with symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). With the completion of the acquisition, NxThera will become part of the Boston Scientific Urology and Pelvic Health business.\n\"We are confident in the potential for this system to help patients with BPH and increase the number of men choosing MITs, because it offers long-term relief from symptoms without the side effects of medications,\" said Dave Pierce, executive vice president and president, MedSurg, Boston Scientific. \"The minimally invasive therapy segment is the fastest growing category in the treatment of BPH and, as an office-based procedure, the Rezūm system is appealing to patients, clinicians and payers.\"\nThe Boston Scientific Urology and Pelvic Health business provides a range of treatment options for men's and women's urological and gynecological conditions. The Rezūm system complements the company's existing portfolio of treatment options for symptomatic BPH, which includes the GreenLight XPS TM Laser Therapy system and holmium laser platforms.\nThe two organizations announced a definitive agreement on March 21, 2018 for Boston Scientific to acquire NxThera.\nAbout Boston Scientific\nBoston Scientific transforms lives through innovative medical solutions that improve the health of patients around the world.
