    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell said on Thursday it would write down its reserves in the Groningen gas field, one of Europe’s largest, following the Dutch government’s decision to phase out production by 2030.\nFILE PHOTO: A passenger plane flies over a Shell logo at a petrol station in west London, January 29, 2015. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo The Anglo-Dutch company holds a 50 percent stake in the field, which has seen production reduced in recent years following a series of damaging earthquakes.\nShell said it expects to write off an estimated 0.5 to 0.65 billion barrels of oil equivalent in 2018.\nShell also took an impairment of $244 million in the first quarter as a result of the government’s decision.\nGas company NAM is a joint venture of Shell and Exxon Mobil that runs the field.\nReporting by Ron Bousso; Editing by Dale Hudson\n ",
