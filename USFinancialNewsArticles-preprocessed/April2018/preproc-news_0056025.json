    "text": "DUBLIN, Alkermes plc (Nasdaq: ALKS) today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\n\"Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and reflect the solid growth of our proprietary commercial products and the continued strength of our royalty and manufacturing business,\" commented James Frates, Chief Financial Officer of Alkermes. \"Today, we are updating our financial expectations for 2018, driven primarily by the timing of investments we will make in our commercial organization in preparation for the potential launch of ALKS 5461 in 2019. We remain well positioned to execute on our strategy to drive long-term value through important investments in our development pipeline and the growth of VIVITROL ® and ARISTADA ® .\"\nQuarter Ended Mar. 31, 2018 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenues for the quarter were $225.2 million. This compared to $191.8 million for the same period in the prior year, representing an increase of 17%. Net loss according to generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP) was $62.5 million for the quarter, or a basic and diluted GAAP net loss per share of $0.40. This compared to GAAP net loss of $68.9 million, or a basic and diluted GAAP net loss per share of $0.45 for the same period in the prior year. Non-GAAP net loss was $14.2 million for the quarter, or a non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per share of $0.09. This compared to non-GAAP net loss of $27.9 million, or a non-GAAP basic and diluted net loss per share of $0.18 for the same period in the prior year.\n\"VIVITROL ® and ARISTADA ® continue to demonstrate solid growth year-over-year and we have made significant progress in making these important medicines available to patients. We continue to focus on initiatives to promote broad and seamless access for patients,\" stated Jim Robinson, President and Chief Operating Officer of Alkermes. \"The upcoming potential approval and launch of Aripiprazole Lauroxil NanoCrystal ® Dispersion (AL NCD ), a novel, investigational product designed for initiation onto ARISTADA, is an opportunity to address unmet patient need and expand the ARISTADA product family. Similarly, against the backdrop of new data, funding and policy being implemented to address the opioid epidemic, we have an opportunity to further expand patient access to VIVITROL, increase utilization and drive growth.\"\nQuarter Ended Mar. 31, 2018 Financial Results\nRevenues\nNet sales of VIVITROL were $62.7 million, compared to $58.5 million for the same period in the prior year, representing an increase of approximately 7%. Net sales of ARISTADA were $29.2 million, compared to $18.0 million for the same period in the prior year, representing an increase of approximately 62%. Manufacturing and royalty revenues from RISPERDAL CONSTA ® , INVEGA SUSTENNA ® /XEPLION ® and INVEGA TRINZA ® /TREVICTA ® were $68.8 million, compared to $60.0 million for the same period in the prior year. Manufacturing and royalty revenues from AMPYRA ® /FAMPYRA ®1 were $28.3 million, compared to $29.2 million for the same period in the prior year. Research and development revenues from the collaboration with Biogen for BIIB098 (formerly ALKS 8700) were $17.5 million.\nCosts and Expenses\nOperating expenses were $287.0 million, compared to $262.6 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting increased investment in the commercialization of VIVITROL and ARISTADA. Net interest expense during the quarter was $4.0 million and included a $2.3 million charge related to the refinancing of the company's term loan. The company refinanced its term loan to extend the maturity to 2023 and reduce the interest rate by 0.5%.\n\"Alkermes is entering the final stages of development for three of our pipeline candidates. The regulatory review of ALKS 5461 is back on track and we continue to prepare for potential approval and launch in 2019. For ALKS 3831, we recently completed enrollment of the ENLIGHTEN-2 pivotal study, with topline data expected in the fourth quarter of 2018. For BIIB098, preparation of the regulatory submission has begun and we are on track to submit the NDA toward year-end,\" said Richard Pops, Chief Executive Officer of Alkermes. \"We are on the threshold of our next phase of growth. Our dedication and determination to bring these important new medicines to patients are steadfast and we look forward to sharing our progress throughout the year.\"\nRecent Events:\nALKS 5461: New Drug Application (NDA) accepted for filing by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in patients with inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapy. A target action date of Jan. 31, 2019 was assigned under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA). ALKS 3831: Enrollment completed for ENLIGHTEN-2, a six-month weight study compared to olanzapine in patients with stable schizophrenia. Topline results are expected in the fourth quarter of 2018. BIIB098: MRI and relapse results from the phase 3 EVOLVE-MS-1 study in patients with relapsing and remitting multiple sclerosis were presented at the 70th annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN). James (Jim) Robinson appointed to the role of President and Chief Operating Officer of Alkermes. Mr. Robinson's responsibilities include leading Alkermes' global Commercial, Operations, Business Development and Human Resources functions.\nFinancial Expectations for 2018\nAlkermes is updating its financial expectations for 2018 to reflect the expected timing of potential approval and launch of ALKS 5461 in 2019. The following outlines Alkermes' updated financial expectations for 2018.\nRevenues: The company continues to expect total revenues to range from $975 million to $1.025 billion, driven by continuing growth of VIVITROL and ARISTADA. Included in this total revenue expectation, Alkermes continues to expect VIVITROL net sales to range from $300 million to $330 million, and ARISTADA net sales to range from $140 million to $160 million. Cost of Goods Manufactured and Sold: The company continues to expect cost of goods manufactured and sold to range from $180 million to $190 million. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses: The company continues to expect R&D expenses to range from $415 million to $445 million. Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses: The company now expects SG&A expenses to range from $515 million to $545 million, reduced from a previous expectation of $555 million to $585 million. This reduction is driven by the shift into 2019 of certain launch-related expenditures including the hiring of the ALKS 5461 sales force, and share-based compensation expense related to certain company-wide performance-based restricted stock unit awards, which vest upon FDA approval of ALKS 5461. Amortization of Intangible Assets: The company continues to expect amortization of intangibles to be approximately $65 million. Net Interest Expense: The company continues to expect net interest expense to be approximately $10 million. Income Tax Expense: The company continues to expect income tax expense of up to $10 million. GAAP Net Loss: The company now expects GAAP net loss to range from $210 million to $240 million, or a basic and diluted loss per share of $1.35 to $1.55, based on a weighted average basic and diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares outstanding. This compares to previous expectations of GAAP net loss in the range of $250 million to $280 million, or a basic and diluted loss per share of $1.61 to $1.81, based on a weighted average basic and diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares outstanding. Non-GAAP Net Income (Loss): The company now expects non-GAAP results to range from a non-GAAP net loss of $10 million to a non-GAAP net income of $20 million, or a non-GAAP basic and diluted loss per share of $0.06 to a non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.12, based on a weighted average basic share count of approximately 155 million shares outstanding and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 161 million shares outstanding. This compares to previous expectations of non-GAAP net loss in the range of $5 million to $35 million, or a basic and diluted non-GAAP net loss per share of $0.03 to $0.23, based on a weighted average basic and diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares outstanding. Share-Based Compensation: The company now expects share-based compensation of approximately $120 million, reduced from approximately $140 million. This reflects the anticipated timing of vesting of certain company-wide performance-based restricted stock unit awards, which vest upon FDA approval of ALKS 5461. Capital Expenditures: The company continues to expect capital expenditures to range from $80 million to $90 million.\nConference Call\nAlkermes will host a conference call and webcast presentation with accompanying slides at 8:30 a.m. ET (1:30 p.m. BST) on Thursday, Apr. 26, 2018, to discuss these financial results and provide an update on the company.

For more information, please visit Alkermes' website at www.alkermes.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release includes information about certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP), including non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share. These non-GAAP measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similar measures presented by other companies.\nNon-GAAP net income (loss) adjusts for one-time and non-cash charges by excluding from GAAP results: share-based compensation expense; amortization; depreciation; non-cash net interest expense; certain other one-time or non-cash items; and the income tax effect of these reconciling items.\nThe company's management and board of directors utilize these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the company's performance. The company provides these non-GAAP measures of the company's performance to investors because management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed with the company's results under GAAP and the accompanying reconciliations, are useful in identifying underlying trends in ongoing operations. However, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measures as indicators of operating performance. Further, non-GAAP net income (loss) and non-GAAP basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share should not be considered measures of our liquidity.\nA reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures has been provided in the tables included in this press release.\nNote Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements set forth in this press release constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, including, but not limited to, statements concerning: future financial and operating performance, business plans or prospects; the likelihood of continued revenue growth from the company's commercial products, including the growth of VIVITROL and ARISTADA; the potential therapeutic and commercial value of the company's marketed and development products and patient access to such products; expectations concerning the timing and results of clinical development activities, including the timing of the phase 3 clinical trial (ENLIGHTEN-2) data readout for ALKS 3831, the timing of the submission of the NDA for BIIB098, and the outcome and timing of the FDA's review of the NDAs for AL NCD and ALKS 5461; and expectations concerning the timing and results of commercial activities, including the expected launches of AL NCD and ALKS 5461.
