(Nasdaq: LLNW) (Limelight), a global leader in digital content delivery, today reported revenue of $52.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, up 16 percent, compared to $44.7 million in the first quarter of 2017, and up 8% compared to $48.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Currency favorably impacted year-over-year comparison by $0.5 million and the sequential comparison by $0.3 million.\nGAAP gross margin was 51.2% in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 390 basis points from 47.3% in the first quarter of 2017.\nLimelight reported net income of $0.1 million, or break-even per basic and fully diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $3.3 million, or loss of $0.03 per basic share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP net income was $6.2 million, or $0.06 per basic share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to non-GAAP net income of $1.6 million, or $0.02 per basic share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nEBITDA was $4.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $1.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was $11.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $6.7 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nLimelight ended the first quarter with 544 employees and employee equivalents, up from 533 at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017, and up from 528 at the end of the first quarter of 2017.\n“Limelight has started 2018 on a strong note, with double-digit revenue growth, gross margins in excess of 50 percent, and positive GAAP profitability. We are raising our full-year guidance and are excited about the opportunities that surround us. We continue to be encouraged by healthy growth trends for content delivery, and we are pleased with the completion of certain matters we think will be of value to Limelight shareholders going forward. For example, in recent months, Goldman Sachs successfully exited its large equity ownership stake in Limelight, which erases a decade-long stock overhang issue. Separately, Limelight also entered into a definitive agreement with Akamai with regard to all outstanding litigation, bringing to an end an equally longstanding legal battle between the two companies,” said Bob Lento, Chief Executive Officer at Limelight Networks.\n“We continue to expand Limelight’s product features and functionality, and improve our efficiency and reliability, to enable Limelight customers to better achieve their goals. We believe Limelight’s focus on quality will allow us to remain disciplined in our approach to pricing. Our business purpose is secure, global delivery of digital content, and we will remain true to our mission. And our initiatives to build out Edge Computing solutions, and expand into adjacent markets, remain on track,” Lento added.\nWeighing early strength in Limelight’s financial and operational performance and what the company perceives as favorable industry tailwinds, Limelight is providing the following updates to its previously announced full-year 2018 guidance, issued on February 7, 2018:\nRevenue is expected to be in the range of $198 to $202 million, up from previously issued guidance of $196 to $200 million. Gross margin expectation is now an improvement of over 150 basis points, up from our previous guidance of a 100 basis point improvement. GAAP EPS is expected to be between $0.07 and $0.11. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $0.13 and $0.17 per share, up from $0.11 and $0.15 per share. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be between $33 and $37 million, compared to our previous guidance of between $32 and $36 million. At the same time, operational efficiency will allow us to deliver these higher results with lower capital deployment. We now expect capital expenditures to be between $20 and $22 million, down from our previous expectation of between $22 and $24 million.\nFinancial Tables\nLIMELIGHT NETWORKS, INC.

These measures include the same adjustments that management takes into account when it reviews and assesses operating performance on a period-to-period basis. We consider Non-GAAP net income (loss) to be an important indicator of overall business performance. We define Non-GAAP net income (loss) to be U.S. GAAP net income (loss) adjusted to exclude share-based compensation and litigation expenses. We believe that EBITDA provides a useful metric to investors to compare us with other companies within our industry and across industries. We define EBITDA as U.S. GAAP net income (loss) adjusted to exclude depreciation and amortization, interest expense, interest and other (income) expense, and income tax expense. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA adjusted to exclude share-based compensation and litigation expenses. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to review and assess operating performance. Our management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures because, collectively, they provide valuable information on the performance of our on-going operations, excluding non-cash charges, taxes and non-core activities (including interest payments related to financing activities). These measures also enable our management to compare the results of our on-going operations from period to period, and allow management to review the performance of our on-going operations against our peer companies and against other companies in our industry and adjacent industries. We believe these measures also provide similar insights to investors, and enable investors to review our results of operations “through the eyes of management.”\nFurthermore, our management uses these Non-GAAP financial measures to assist them in making decisions regarding our strategic priorities and areas for future investment and focus.\nThe terms Non-GAAP net income (loss), EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not defined under U.S. GAAP, and are not measures of operating income, operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our Non-GAAP net income (loss), EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and when assessing our operating performance, Non-GAAP net income (loss), EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for net income (loss) or other consolidated income statement data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations include, but are not limited to:\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; these measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; Non-GAAP net income (loss) and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the cash requirements necessary for litigation costs, including provision for litigation and litigation expenses; these measures do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt that we may incur; these measures do not reflect income taxes or the cash requirements for any tax payments; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will be replaced sometime in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; while share-based compensation is a component of operating expense, the impact on our financial statements compared to other companies can vary significantly due to such factors as the assumed life of the options and the assumed volatility of our common stock; and other companies may calculate Non-GAAP net income (loss), EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nWe compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using Non-GAAP net income (loss), EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA only as supplemental support for management's analysis of business performance. Non-GAAP net income (loss), EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are calculated as follows for the periods presented in thousands:\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nLimelight is presenting the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures and reconciling the non-GAAP financial metrics to the comparable U.S. GAAP measures.
