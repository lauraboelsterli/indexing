REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer Speaking at his first news conference as chief executive at VW’s headquarters in Wolfsburg, Diess said he would look at the different assets in VW’s portfolio, which include Renk and MAN Diesel, and review whether keeping them makes sense.\n“We will review all options,” Diess said, adding that this could include investing in the businesses or pursuing a sale.\nReporting by Andreas Cremer; Writing by Edward Taylor; Editing by Maria Sheahan\n ",
