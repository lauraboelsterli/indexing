    "text": "- First Quarter saw Continued Improvements to Industry Leading Adjusted EBITDA Margins, with all Three Operating Segments Generating Year over Year Growth -\n- Increases 2018 Full Year Guidance -\nWYOMISSING, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Penn National Gaming, Inc. (PENN: Nasdaq) (“Penn National” or the “Company”) today announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018, initiated 2018 second quarter guidance and increased its full year guidance.\nTimothy J. Wilmott, Chief Executive Officer, commented: “We are pleased to report that Penn National delivered a strong first quarter that exceeded our guidance. We are achieving significant benefits from our ongoing margin enhancement initiatives, which helped all three operating segments generate year over year adjusted EBITDA growth. In addition, more than half of our properties achieved year-over-year EBITDA growth and 65% of our gaming operations delivered adjusted EBITDA margin increases despite having to navigate difficult weather impacts during the quarter.\n2018 First Quarter Financial Highlights:\nNet revenues of $816.1 million; a 5.1% increase Income from operations of $172.1 million, up 22.7%; Adjusted EBITDA of $242.6 million, up 6.6%; Adjusted EBITDA after master lease payments of $126.7 million, up 10.2%; Adjusted EBITDA margins increased by 42 basis points to 29.72%, with 15 of our 23 gaming operations delivering improved margins; and Traditional net debt ratio declined to 2.25x from 2.49x and gross and net leverage inclusive of master lease obligations declined to 5.45x and 5.20x, respectively, from 5.78x and 5.46x at December 31, 2017.\nMargin Enhancement Plan\nMr. Wilmott continued, “We continue to make great strides with the margin enhancement plan we announced last October, and we are only in the early stages of implementation. We are confident we will continue to expand margins throughout the year based on ongoing refinements we are making in procurement, marketing, and labor. As a result, our increased 2018 guidance reflects adjusted EBITDA margins that are above our previously disclosed margin improvement targets for the year.”\nPinnacle Acquisition Update\n“On March 29, shareholders of both Penn National and Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. (PNK: Nasdaq) (“Pinnacle”) overwhelmingly approved our proposed merger, with over 99% of all votes cast in favor of the transaction. Additionally, we have secured regulatory approvals, subject to customary conditions, from Pennsylvania (both the Gaming Control Board and the Racing Commission), West Virginia and Illinois. This week and over the coming months we’ll be appearing before additional regulatory bodies to seek their approvals. Based on our progress to date, we remain confident of closing the transaction in the second half of this year. In the meantime, having visited all of the Pinnacle properties, as well as their Las Vegas Service Center on multiple occasions, we remain very impressed by their talented property and corporate teams and continue to make meaningful progress with our integration planning. As we’ve learned more about Pinnacle’s operations and processes, we are confident our $100 million of cost synergy objectives are well within reach,” said Wilmott.\nAs previously reported, following the closing of the proposed transaction, Penn National will enjoy significantly greater operational scale and geographic diversity from a combined 41 properties in 20 jurisdictions, including 15 of the top 30 Metropolitan Statistical Areas in America.\nAs a result of Penn National’s ability to fund the purchase consideration with a combination of equity, debt and asset sale proceeds, the transaction will result in only a modest near-term increase in the Company’s traditional net leverage ratio. The combined entity will generate significant free cash flow, which the Company initially intends to allocate to de-leveraging and other initiatives that it believes will enhance long-term shareholder value.\nRecent Development Activity\n“During the quarter, Penn National was the winning bidder for two of Pennsylvania’s new Category 4 ‘satellite casino’ licenses, which were created through the gaming expansion law approved last October. The licenses allow us to operate up to 750 slot machines and initially up to 30 table games at each facility in the areas of York County and Berks/Lancaster County. We sought to strategically locate our satellite casinos in these areas, as a means of protecting the existing market for Hollywood Casino at Penn National Race Course while also penetrating new, more populous areas. While we have not yet determined a specific site in either location, we will be exploring several viable options in the near term. We are confident these facilities will yield attractive returns on our investments.\n“With the operating momentum across our business and significant and growing free cash flow, Penn National continues to have the financial flexibility to select from a range of alternatives to further enhance shareholder value including leverage reduction, additional share repurchases, and pursuing additional opportunistic, accretive tuck-in acquisitions,” concluded Wilmott.\nSummary of First Quarter Results\n(in millions, except per share data) Three Months Ended March 31,\n2018 Actual 2018 Guidance (3) 2017 Actual Net Revenues $ 816.1 $ 817.3 $ 776.2 Net income $ 45.4 $ 38.6 $ 5.1 Adjusted EBITDA (1) (2) $ 242.6 $ 233.6 $ 227.4 Less: Master Lease payments 115.9 115.7 112.4 Adjusted EBITDA after Master Lease payments (1) (2) $ 126.7 $ 117.9 $ 115.0 Diluted earnings per common share $ 0.48 $ 0.41 $ 0.06 1) During the first quarter of 2018, the Company changed its definition of Adjusted EBITDA to exclude preopening costs, significant transaction costs and the variance between our budgeted and actual costs incurred on cash-settled stock based awards. See Note 2 below for the components of the definition. We believe these changes will enhance comparability with our competitors’ definition of Adjusted EBITDA. Prior period results were reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 2) Adjusted EBITDA is income (loss) from operations, excluding the impact of stock compensation, debt extinguishment and financing charges, impairment charges, insurance recoveries and deductible charges, depreciation and amortization, changes in the estimated fair value of our contingent purchase price obligations, gain or loss on disposal of assets, the difference between budget and actual expense for cash-settled stock-based awards, preopening and significant transaction costs and other income or expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is also inclusive of income or loss from unconsolidated affiliates, with our share of the non-operating items added back for our joint venture in Kansas Entertainment, LLC (“Kansas Entertainment” or “Kansas JV”). Adjusted EBITDA excludes payments pursuant to the Company’s Master Lease (the “Master Lease”) with Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (“GLPI”), as the transaction was accounted for as a financing obligation. See below for reconciliation of the difference between guidance and actual for the current quarterly period, as well as the reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP measures for additional information. 3) The guidance figures in the table above present the guidance Penn National provided on February 8, 2018 for the three months ended March 31, 2018.

The Company is now required to defer revenue at the estimated standalone selling price of the loyalty rewards as they are earned by our customers and recognize revenue when the rewards are redeemed. Prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard, the estimated liability for unredeemed rewards was accrued based on the estimated costs of the service or merchandise to be provided. 2) The new revenue standard changed the accounting for promotional allowances. The Company is no longer permitted to report revenue for goods and services provided to customers for free as an inducement to gamble as gross revenue with a corresponding reduction in promotional allowances to arrive at net revenues (discretionary comps). The new revenue standard requires complimentaries related to an inducement to gamble to be recorded as a reduction to gaming revenues, and as such promotional allowances are no longer netted on our condensed consolidated statements of income. In addition, the new revenue standard changed the accounting for promotional allowances with respect to non-discretionary complimentaries (i.e. a customer’s redemption of loyalty points). Under the new revenue standard, the Company is no longer permitted to report revenue for goods and services provided to a customer resulting from loyalty reward redemptions with a corresponding reduction in promotional allowances to arrive at net revenue. As such, promotional allowances related to a customer’s redemption of loyalty rewards is no longer netted on our condensed consolidated statements of income. 3) The new revenue standard changed the accounting for reimbursable costs associated with our management service contract for Casino Rama. Under the new revenue standard, reimbursable costs, which primarily consist of payroll costs, must be recognized as revenue on a gross basis, with an offsetting amount charged to reimbursable management costs within operating expenses. Prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard, we recorded these reimbursable amounts on a net basis, and as such they were not recorded in revenues or operating expenses. 4) The new revenue standard changed the accounting for racing revenues. Under the new revenue standard, we are not the controlling entity to the arrangement(s), but rather function as an agent to the pari-mutuel pool. As such, fees and obligations related to the Company’s share of purse funding requirements, simulcasting fees, tote fees, certain pari-mutuel taxes and other fees directly related to our racing operations must be reported on a net basis and included as a deduction to food, beverage, hotel and other revenue. Prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard, we recorded these fees and obligations in food, beverage, hotel and other expense.

The Company’s definition of adjusted EBITDA adds back our share of the impact of non-operating items (such as depreciation and amortization) at our joint ventures that have gaming operations. At this time, Kansas Entertainment, the operator of Hollywood Casino at Kansas Speedway, is Penn National’s only joint venture that meets this definition. Kansas Entertainment does not currently have, nor has it ever had, any indebtedness. The table below presents cash flow distributions we have received from this investment for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Cash flow distributions $ 6,500 $ 5,750 The table below summarizes certain cash expenditures incurred by the Company during the periods presented in this earnings release.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Master Lease rental payments $ 115,874 $ 112,450 Cash income tax (refunds)/payments 2,233 (9,303 ) Cash interest expense on traditional debt 22,193 16,580 Maintenance capital expenditures 10,602 10,978 Share Repurchase Program\nReflecting the repurchase of 1,264,149 common shares for $24,770,470 in the twelve month period ended December 31, 2017, Penn National has the authority to repurchase up to an additional $75.2 million of its common shares by February 2019.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to GAAP financial measures, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA after Master Lease payments are used by management as important measures of the Company’s operating performance.\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, stock compensation, debt extinguishment and financing charges, impairment charges, insurance recoveries and deductible charges, depreciation and amortization, changes in the estimated fair value of our contingent purchase price obligations, gain or loss on disposal of assets, the difference between budget and actual expense for cash-settled stock-based awards, preopening and significant transaction costs and other income or expenses. Adjusted EBITDA is also inclusive of income or loss from unconsolidated affiliates, with our share of non-operating items (such as depreciation and amortization) added back for our joint venture in Kansas Entertainment. Adjusted EBITDA excludes payments associated with our Master Lease agreement with GLPI as the transaction was accounted for as a financing obligation.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we changed the definition of Adjusted EBITDA to exclude preopening costs, significant transaction costs and the variance between our budgeted and actual costs incurred on cash-settled stock based awards which are required to be marked to market each reporting period. We determined to exclude preopening costs and significant transaction costs to more closely align the Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA with our competitors. Preopening costs and significant transaction costs are also excluded from adjusted EBITDA for bonus calculation purposes. We have excluded the favorable or unfavorable difference between the budgeted expense and actual expense for our cash-settled stock-based awards as it is non-operational in nature. Additionally, this variance is excluded from adjusted EBITDA for bonus calculation purposes. In connection with the change to the definition of Adjusted EBITDA, we reclassified our prior period results to conform to the current period presentation.\nAdjusted EBITDA has economic substance because it is used by management as a performance measure to analyze the performance of our business, and is especially relevant in evaluating large, long lived casino projects because they provide a perspective on the current effects of operating decisions separated from the substantial non-operational depreciation charges and financing costs of such projects. We also present adjusted EBITDA because it is used by some investors and creditors as an indicator of the strength and performance of ongoing business operations, including our ability to service debt, fund capital expenditures, acquisitions and operations. These calculations are commonly used as a basis for investors, analysts and credit rating agencies to evaluate and compare operating performance and value companies within our industry. In addition, gaming companies have historically reported adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to financial measures in accordance with GAAP. In order to view the operations of their casinos on a more stand-alone basis, gaming companies, including us, have historically excluded from their adjusted EBITDA calculations certain corporate expenses that do not relate to the management of specific casino properties. However, adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA information is presented as a supplemental disclosure, as management believes that it is a widely used measure of performance in the gaming industry, is used in the valuation of gaming companies, and that it is considered by many to be a key indicator of the Company’s operating results. Management uses adjusted EBITDA as an important measure of the operating performance of its segments, including the evaluation of operating personnel. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income, as an indicator of the Company’s operating performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity, or as any other measure of performance determined in accordance with GAAP. The Company has significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in adjusted EBITDA. It should also be noted that other gaming companies that report adjusted EBITDA information may calculate adjusted EBITDA in a different manner than the Company and therefore, comparability may be limited.\nAdjusted EBITDA after Master Lease payments is a measure we believe provides useful information to investors because it is an indicator of the performance of ongoing business operations after incorporating the cash flow impact of Master Lease payments to GLPI. In addition, adjusted EBITDA after Master Lease payments is the metric that our executive management team is measured against for incentive based compensation purposes.\nA reconciliation of the Company’s net income (loss) per GAAP to adjusted EBITDA, as well as the Company’s income (loss) from operations per GAAP to adjusted EBITDA, is included above. Additionally, a reconciliation of each segment’s income (loss) from operations to adjusted EBITDA is also included above. On a segment level, income (loss) from operations per GAAP, rather than net income (loss) per GAAP is reconciled to adjusted EBITDA due to, among other things, the impracticability of allocating interest expense, interest income, income taxes and certain other items to the Company’s segments on a segment by segment basis. Management believes that this presentation is more meaningful to investors in evaluating the performance of the Company’s segments and is consistent with the reporting of other gaming companies.\nConference Call, Webcast and Replay Details\nPenn National Gaming is hosting a conference call and simultaneous webcast at 9:00 am ET today, both of which are open to the general public.
