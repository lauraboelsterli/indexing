    "text": "2 COMMENTS I love walking, whether in the country or the city, but I must admit that it frustrates me sometimes to have to move at the constrained pace of an urban crowd. And here’s a strange thing: I find that this slowing down tires me out. I can walk for miles at my own (fairly brisk) pace without feeling anything, but if I have to reduce my speed, my legs start to ache. This odd effect highlights something interesting about the physics of walking.\nWe tend to assume that every time we do something, we have to put in effort to make it happen. But energy is precious, and no species can afford to fritter it away. So when we walk, we don’t start every step from scratch. We reuse some of the energy from the step before in a rhythmic cycle that’s impressively efficient.\nImagine the point where the back foot has just pushed off. The leg that’s touching the ground is fairly rigid and straight, and the push has provided enough forward speed for your hips to be carried over the top of the leg, following a circular path just like the pencil on a compass. Once your hips are past the halfway point, you’re just falling forward, still pivoting around the planted foot.\nThat could result in a tumble—except that the other leg has been busy too. After it pushes off, and the knee bends slightly, it acts like a pendulum suspended from your hips. And just like a pendulum, it swings forward under the force of gravity. As your body is falling forward, the pendulum leg swings into place to touch the ground just at the right time to stop you landing on your face. And then your weight shifts over both feet and the cycle starts again.\nThe clever bit is that swinging leg. The length of time it takes a pendulum to swing from one extreme to the other is fixed and depends on a pendulum’s length and mass distribution. By making your step rate match the natural swing time of your leg, your body doesn’t have to actively move the leg but just relaxes at the hip joint. Gravity takes care of the rest. Taller people have longer legs, so they step fewer times a minute because their leg pendulum swings more slowly.\nThe other half of the mechanism carries your body over the planted leg as the pendulum swings. The foot push gives you enough momentum to vault over the top of the leg without too much extra effort on the way. This efficient combined system saves you considerable energy.\nMore in Everyday Physics\nThe Freeze and Thaw That Give Us Maple Syrup March 21, 2018 The Secrets of Those Olympic Ice Crystals February 8, 2018 Most humans naturally choose the speed that is the most energy efficient for their leg length, taking advantage of this pendulum system. To move at any other speed, your muscles need to do far more work to get your legs into the right place at the right time. That’s why doctors recommend increasing your speed to get moderate exercise from walking. You need to push yourself outside the superefficient zone to expend a significant amount of energy.\nThis is also why the Apollo astronauts couldn’t walk “normally” on the Moon. Its much lower gravity made their leg pendulums swing very slowly, so it was far more efficient form them to run or jump.\nThis spring, if I have to enjoy the sunshine at other people’s pace, at least I can console myself that I’ve spent enough extra energy to justify an extra cookie with my tea when I get home.",
