    "text": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters Thursday of \"an opportunity to make significant progress\" on the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ).\nTrudeau said that he was looking for a deal that was \"win, win, win\" and would \"stand up for the interests in Canada.\"\n\"We recognize the timelines that are in play,\" he said, referencing the Mexican election in July and U.S. mid-terms in the autumn.\nCNBC reported Wednesday that the U.S. is targeting a tie-up of NAFTA within weeks.\nTrudeau was speaking in London, where he is attending the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. He did not go into details about what the \"opportunity\" might be.\nWhen asked about cybersecurity following the recent Facebook data-gathering scandal, Trudeau said that he had been \"very much engaged with top platforms like Facebook in the past year or two.\"\nBut he described the issue as an \"area that requires more work.\"",
