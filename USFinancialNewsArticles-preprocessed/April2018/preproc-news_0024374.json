    "text": "April 11, 2018 / 9:55 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Wolves win to move within two points of Premier League Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - A wonder goal from Ruben Neves helped power Championship leaders Wolverhampton Wanderers to a 2-0 victory over Derby County at Molineux on Wednesday that pushes them to the brink of earning Premier League football next season. Soccer Football - Championship - Wolverhampton Wanderers vs Derby County - Molineux Stadium, Wolverhampton, Britain - April 11, 2018 Wolves' Ruben Neves celebrates with Conor Coady after scoring their second goal Action Images/Andrew Boyers \nThe Portuguese international Neves scored an astonishing dipping 51st minute volley from 30 metres out to seal the win that puts Wolves 11 points clear at the top of England’s second-tier standings. \nDiogo Jota, another of Wolves’ Portuguese contingent, had struck after six minutes to launch the leaders towards a win that leaves them two points from sealing promotion, mathematically, to the Premier League after a six-year absence. \nThey could seal top flight football by beating their Midlands rivals Birmingham City on Sunday at their Molineux fortress. Slideshow (5 Images) \nYet if second-placed Fulham fail to beat Brentford at home on Saturday, Wolves could even be celebrating promotion 24 hours before that match. \nNuno Santo’s entertaining Wolves side have enjoyed a special season but their fans had seen nothing to top the strike from Neves, who controlled a Derby clearance, flicked up the ball and unleashed an unstoppable volley. \nThe win moved Wolves on to 92 points from 42 games, 11 clear of Fulham, who currently hold the other automatic promotion place by a point from Cardiff City, who have a game in hand. \nDerby’s own promotion push was dented as they stand fifth among the playoff places on 68 points.
