(NYSE:STAY) (together, the “Company”) today announced consolidated results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nTotal revenues grew 2.3% to $297.8 million Comparable system-wide Revenue Per Available Room (“RevPAR”) grew 3.7% to $47.50 Adjusted EBITDA increased 2.0% to $132.2 million Adjusted Funds From Operations (“Adjusted FFO”) 1 of $0.42 per diluted Paired Share, an increase of 18.2% Adjusted Paired Share Income 1 of $0.19 per diluted Paired Share, an increase of 33.5%\nExtended Stay America’s President and Chief Executive Officer, Jonathan Halkyard, commented, “We delivered a strong performance during the first quarter, despite a negative impact from the Easter holiday shift, allowing us to grow Adjusted EBITDA and RevPAR for the quarter. Year to date, we have made significant progress on our growth strategy, 'ESA 2.0', having sold 26 hotels at attractive multiples, received commitments for 15 new ESA hotels, are in active negotiations to sell up to another 45 hotels and acquired sites for our own development.”\nMr. Halkyard continued, “Additionally, this is the fourth consecutive year as a public company that we have increased our combined quarterly dividend to shareholders, despite having sold 84 hotels over that time period. This dividend raise, combined with an increase in the pace of Paired Share repurchases, highlight that returning capital to shareholders is a top priority for our Company.”\nFinancial and Operating Results\nTotal revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were $297.8 million, an increase of 2.3% over the same period in 2017. The increase in total revenues was driven by an increase in RevPAR, partially offset by hotel dispositions in 2017 and in 2018.\nComparable system-wide RevPAR for the three months ended March 31, 2018 grew 3.7% over the same period in 2017, driven by an improvement in average daily rate (“ADR”) of 4.0%, partially offset by a 20 basis point decline in occupancy to 70.3% driven by the Easter calendar shift. Comparable company owned hotel RevPAR increased 3.8% during the quarter to $47.92, driven by an ADR increase of 4.0%. Company owned hotel RevPAR increased 4.7% reflecting the sales of non-core hotels and the increase in comparable company owned hotel RevPAR.\nHotel Operating Margin 1 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 52.2% compared to 52.5% in the same period in 2017. Hotel Operating Margin flow-through, defined as the change in Hotel Operating Profit 1 divided by the change in total hotel revenues was 34.4%.\nNet income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $31.1 million compared to $16.1 million in the same period in 2017. Net income in the first quarter was favorably impacted by increased revenues, a gain on asset sales, a lower effective tax rate and lower depreciation and amortization, partially offset by an increase in impairment charges. Income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $5.8 million compared to $4.5 million in the same period in 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $132.2 million. Adjusted EBITDA excludes non-cash equity-based compensation expense of $2.4 million, impairment charges of $43.6 million, $38.1 million of gains on asset sales and loss on disposal of assets and other net expenses of $1.7 million.\nAdjusted FFO for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $80.0 million, an increase of 16.5% compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in Adjusted FFO was primarily due to a lower effective tax rate, increased revenues and lower interest expense. Adjusted FFO per diluted Paired Share 1 was $0.42 compared to $0.35 in the same period in 2017. Adjusted FFO, a non-GAAP measure, represents funds from operations, as adjusted, attributable to the consolidated enterprise, whose representative equity security is a Paired Share. A Paired Share entitles its holder to participate in 100% of the common equity and earnings of both Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH Hospitality, Inc.\nAdjusted Paired Share Income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $37.5 million, or $0.19 per diluted Paired Share, compared to $28.5 million, or $0.15 per diluted Paired Share, in the same period in 2017. The increase in Adjusted Paired Share Income was due to a decrease in effective tax rate, increased revenues, lower depreciation expense and lower interest expense. Adjusted Paired Share Income, a non-GAAP measure, represents net income, as adjusted, attributable to the consolidated enterprise, whose representative equity security is a Paired Share.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe Company invested $33.6 million in capital expenditures during the first quarter of 2018. This included approximately $4.2 million in capital expenditures for new hotel development and $10.1 million in capital expenditures for IT projects.\nAsset Dispositions and Acquisitions\nIn addition to the 25 portfolio hotel sale in February 2018, the Company completed the previously announced sale of the Austin property for $44.8 million in March 2018. The Company will continue to manage the Austin property under an interim management agreement until the new owner is ready to commence construction on its alternate use and closes the hotel. The Company is currently in active negotiations to sell up to 45 additional hotels to portfolio buyers during 2018.\nThe Company has signed contracts and is engaged in due diligence to acquire two extended stay hotels using 1031 proceeds from its prior asset sales. The Company expects to complete the purchase of one hotel during the second quarter and the other hotel in the third quarter. These two hotels will be converted to the Extended Stay America brand.\nDistribution and Share Repurchases\nOn April 26, 2018, the Boards of Directors of Extended Stay America, Inc. and ESH Hospitality, Inc. declared cash distributions totaling $0.22 per Paired Share for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 4.8%. The distributions are payable on May 25, 2018 to shareholders of record as of May 11, 2018.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased 1.8 million Paired Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $35.2 million. Between April 1, 2018 and April 26, 2018, the Company repurchased 0.8 million Paired Shares for $15.1 million. As of April 26, 2018, the Company had approximately $147.7 million in repurchase authorization remaining.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company’s outlook for 2018 is updated as follows:\nFull Year 2018 Updated Outlook\nPrevious Outlook in millions , except % Low High Low High # of hotels owned on 12/31/18 600 599 Room and other hotel revenues $ 1,257 $ 1,282 $ 1,257 $ 1,282 Comparable system-wide RevPAR % D 1.0 % 3.0 % 1.0 % 3.0 % Net income $ 188 $ 207 $ 197 $ 220 Adjusted Paired Share income/Paired Share $ 1.04 $ 1.14 - - Adjusted EBITDA $ 600 $ 620 $ 600 $ 620 Comparable Adjusted EBITDA % D -0.5 % +2.8 % -0.9 % +2.4 % Depreciation and amortization $ 220 $ 220 $ 220 $ 220 Net interest expense $ 130 $ 130 $ 130 $ 130 Effective tax rate 16 % 17 % 16 % 17 % Capital expenditures $ 205 $ 235 $ 180 $ 210 Cash available for capital return $ 260 $ 300 - - The Company’s updated 2018 outlook for total revenues, Adjusted EBITDA and capital expenditures reflects the recently completed Austin hotel sale and the expected purchase of two extended stay hotels for conversion later in 2018. This outlook does not reflect expected additional asset sales, which we anticipate will reduce total revenues, depreciation and Adjusted EBITDA for the year, but we expect will have limited, if any, impact on Adjusted Paired Share income per diluted Paired Share or Adjusted FFO per diluted Paired Share.\nWebcast and Conference Call Details\nThe Company will host a conference call on Friday, April 27, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.
