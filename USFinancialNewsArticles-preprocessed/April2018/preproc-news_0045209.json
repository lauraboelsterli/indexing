Management uses this non-GAAP information internally to evaluate operating performance and in formulating the budget for future periods. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures discussed below are appropriate for evaluating the operating and liquidity performance of the Company.\nAdjusted Operating Margin\nAdjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted income before income taxes by net revenue. Adjusted income before income taxes excludes the provision (benefit) for loan losses. Management believes that excluding the provision (benefit) for loan losses from operating margin provides a useful measure of the Company's ongoing operating performance because management excludes it when evaluating operating margin performance. See endnote (1) for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure.\nCorporate Cash\nCorporate cash represents cash held at the parent company as well as cash held in certain subsidiaries, not including bank and brokerage subsidiaries, that can distribute cash to the parent company without any regulatory approval or notification. The Company believes that corporate cash is a useful measure of the parent company’s liquidity as it is the primary source of capital above and beyond the capital deployed in regulated subsidiaries. See endnote (6) for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure.\nTangible Common Equity Book Value per Share\nTangible common equity book value per share represents common shareholders’ equity, which excludes preferred stock, less goodwill and other intangible assets (net of related deferred tax liabilities) divided by common stock outstanding. The Company believes that tangible common equity book value per share is a measure of the Company’s capital strength. See endnote (5) for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the comparable GAAP measure.\nIt is important to note that these non-GAAP measures may involve judgment by management and should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or superior to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. For additional information on the adjustments to these non-GAAP measures, please see the Company’s financial statements and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” that will be included in the periodic report the Company expects to file with the SEC with respect to the financial periods discussed herein.\nENDNOTES\n(1) Operating margin is the percentage of net revenue that results in income before income taxes. The percentage is calculated by dividing income before income taxes by total net revenue. The following table provides a reconciliation of GAAP operating margin percentage to non-GAAP adjusted operating margin percentage (dollars in millions):\nQ1 2018 Q4 2017 Q1 2017 Amount Operating\nMargin %\nAmount Operating\nMargin %\nAmount Operating\nMargin %\nIncome before income tax expense and\noperating margin\n$ 334 47% $ 299 47% $ 225 41% Provision (benefit) for loan losses (21 ) (26 ) (14 ) Adjusted income before income tax\nexpense and adjusted operating margin\n$ 313 44% $ 273 43% $ 211 38% (2) Records based on the period during which metric has been reported by the Company. Net new brokerage assets of $5.3 billion in Q1 2018 is a record for the Company when compared to organic net asset growth from prior quarters, excluding one-time inflows related to past acquisitions. See endnote (9) for additional information on net new brokerage assets.\n(3) Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, the Company updated the presentation of its consolidated financial statements as follows:\nOn the consolidated balance sheet, reclassified deferred tax assets, net to other assets. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
