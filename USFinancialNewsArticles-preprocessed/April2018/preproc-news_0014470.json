Soccer Football - Europa League Quarter Final First Leg - Arsenal vs CSKA Moscow - Emirates Stadium, London, Britain - April 5, 2018 Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey reacts after missing a chance to score Action Images via Reuters/John Sibley \nThe 27-year-old, who joined Arsenal in 2008, has scored 57 goals in over 320 senior appearances for the club and is out of contract in June 2019. \nRamsey scored twice for Arsenal as they strolled to a 4-1 win over CSKA Moscow in the first leg of their Europa League quarter-finals on Thursday. \n“Yes, I’m confident, he’s not at the end of his contract, he has one and a half years to go. From my side it is clear, but you always have to find an agreement,” Wenger told reporters on Friday. \n“We want him to stay. He’s one of these guys who has been here for a long time. He will be an important player in the future of this club.” Soccer Football - Europa League Quarter Final First Leg - Arsenal vs CSKA Moscow - Emirates Stadium, London, Britain - April 5, 2018 Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger before the match Action Images via Reuters/John Sibley \nWenger said he will not convince Ramsey to sign a new deal if the Wales international is hesitant as he wants all his players to be grateful to play for the north London club. \n“I don’t want to convince a player (they should sign),” Wenger added. “I want the player to be happy to play for the club. \n“Having players who want to play for the club is the way we want to play football and is in the values we feel are important to us.” \nArsenal are sixth in the league table and host relegation-threatened Southampton on Sunday.
