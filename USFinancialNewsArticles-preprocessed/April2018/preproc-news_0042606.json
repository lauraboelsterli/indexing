    "text": "April 22, 2018 / 8:39 AM / Updated 4 hours ago Trump says 'long way' to go on North Korea crisis Doina Chiacu , Heekyong Yang 6 Min Read \nWASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said the North Korean nuclear crisis is a long way from being resolved on Sunday, striking a cautious note a day after the North’s pledge to end its nuclear tests raised hopes before planned summits with South Korea and the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks as he hosts a joint press conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (not pictured) at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., April 18, 2018.

We all remember how those pledges and commitments went down over past decades,” said Nam Sung-wook, a professor of North Korean Studies at Korea University in Seoul.

REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji \n“Although the North’s announcement is quite dramatic, it’s natural for the world to be extra sensitive to every word spoken by Kim.” \nIn Washington, Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the U.S. government viewed Kim’s pledge with scepticism. \n“This is a great public relations effort by Kim Jong Un,” Corker said on CNN. “I think everyone within the administration and Congress approaches this with scepticism and caution.” \nKim is expected to meet Trump in late May or early June, the first meeting between sitting leaders of the two countries. CIA Director Mike Pompeo, Trump’s nominee to become the next secretary of state, secretly visited North Korea and met with Kim to discuss the summit three weeks ago. \nSenator Tom Cotton, told CBS’“Face the Nation” he hoped the three Americans detained by North Korea would be released before any meeting. The Republican was unimpressed by the North’s overture, saying it “is better than continued testing but it’s not much better than that.” \nU.S. officials say North Korea had in the past repeatedly reneged on denuclearisation agreements, the latest in 2012 when the North launched a long-range rocket after agreeing to a moratorium on missile testing. \nWhite House legislative affairs director Marc Short said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” the U.S. goal remains “full denuclearisation” in which Pyongyang no longer has nuclear weapons. Slideshow (4 Images) PROGRESS OR EMPTY PROMISES? \nSouth Korea said the North’s testing pledge signified “meaningful” progress that would create good conditions for successful summits with Seoul and Washington. \nMoon, who welcomed Kim’s announcement as a “major” step towards denuclearisation, is making Friday’s summit his sole focus this week, a Blue House official said on Sunday. \nFor the past few weeks, South Korea has been renovating Peace House, on its side of Panmunjom, to prepare for the summit with Kim, who will be the first North Korean leader to set foot in the South since the 1950-1953 Korean War. \nMoon now has a direct phone link with Kim on his office desk, instead of having to communicate through a hotline at the Joint Security Area in Panmunjom, which had been the main channel between the two sides over the Winter Olympics in February. \nThe two leaders are expected to talk over the newly installed phone for the first time this week, before the summit, South Korea said on Friday. (GRAPHIC: tmsnrt.rs/2CtuIJS ) \nA senior U.S. diplomat for East Asia, Susan Thornton, called North Korea’s latest announcement “a very positive step” as she started a three-day visit to Seoul on Sunday. \n“We are going to be doing a lot of close coordination with South Korea, allies and partners this week,” the Yonhap news agency quoted her as saying. \nCorker said Washington needed to be clear-headed about what a meeting with Kim could accomplish. \n“To think that somebody’s going to go in and charm him out of that is not realistic,” he told the ABC “This Week” programme. “Is there some progress that can be made? I hope so, but that’s a big hurdle.” \n(GRAPHIC: Lines of communication with North Korea tmsnrt.rs/2CtuIJS ) Reporting by Doina Chiacu and Heekyong Yang in Seoul; Additional reporting by David Morgan in Washington and Haejin Choi in Seoul; Editing by Stephen Coates and Lisa Shumaker",
