A cyclist rides past a Nokia logo during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain February 25, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman\nFirst-quarter group earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) fell 30 percent from a year ago to 239 million euros ($291 million), clearly below analystsâ€™ average forecast of 369 million euros in a Reuters poll.\nNokia, which competes with Ericsson, Huawei [HWT.UL] and ZTE, however lifted its market view, saying that for 2018 as a whole it expected its network sales to outperform the global industry, which is projected to fall 1-3 percent.
