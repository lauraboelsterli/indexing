    "text": "(Reuters) - WPP, the world’s biggest advertising company, is investigating an allegation of personal misconduct against Chief Executive Martin Sorrell who has denied wrongdoing.\nSorrell, who built WPP into the industry leader over three decades, said the allegation concerned financial impropriety and specifically the use of company funds.\n“I reject the allegation unreservedly but recognise that the company has to investigate it,” he said on Wednesday.\nWPP said the allegation did not involve amounts which were material to the company.\nShares in the British company, already down 36 percent in the last 12 months, fell to more than four-year lows on Wednesday. They were down 2.1 percent at 1,094 pence at 0803 GMT.\nFILE PHOTO: Sir Martin Sorrell, chairman and chief executive officer of advertising company WPP, speaks during an interview with CNBC at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., December 13, 2017.
