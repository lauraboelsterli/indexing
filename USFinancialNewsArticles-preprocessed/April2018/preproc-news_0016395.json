    "text": "Andrew McCutchen’s career-best sixth hit of the game, a three-run home run in the bottom of the 14th inning, rallied the San Francisco Giants from a 5-4 deficit and into a 7-5, walk-off win Saturday over the Los Angeles Dodgers in San Francisco.\nAfter the Dodgers had scored off Roberto Gomez (1-0), the Giants’ ninth pitcher, in the top of the 14th, Kelby Tomlinson and Joe Panik led off the bottom of the inning with singles off the Dodgers’ 10th pitcher, Wilmer Font (0-2).\nMcCutchen, who earlier had stroked four singles and a double, then belted the 12th pitch of his at-bat, a 2-2 fastball, over the fence in left field for his first homer as a Giant and seventh career walk-off homer.\nMcCutchen finished 6-for-7 after having totaled just two hits in the Giants’ first six games.\nAfter the score had remained tied at 4-4 since the seventh inning, Yasiel Puig led off the top of the 14th with a single against Gomez.\nHe scampered to third on a single by Cody Bellinger, after which Forsythe put the Dodgers in front for the first time with a single to left field.\nGomez, who had allowed four runs in one inning in Los Angeles last Sunday, didn’t allow any further damage, setting the stage for McCutchen’s big hit. The right-hander was rewarded with his first major league win.\nMcCutchen finished with four RBIs for the Giants, who have won two in a row.\nBuster Posey had a homer for San Francisco while Panik had three hits and Austin Jackson two.\nThe Giants outhit the Dodgers 17-12.\nChase Utley homered for the Dodgers, who lost their fourth straight.\nBellinger, Forsythe, Utley and Corey Seager had two hits each for Los Angeles.\nAfter a season-opening, four-game series in which the losing team was shut out in every game, both clubs scored in multiple innings.\nThe Giants led three times — 1-0, 3-1 and 4-3 — only to be tied by the Dodgers each time.\nThe last time it occurred was in the seventh, when Utley homered off Giants reliever Sam Dyson for a 4-4 tie after the Giants had gone up one on Brandon Belt’s RBI double.\nPosey had a two-run homer for the Giants off Dodgers starter Rich Hill in the fourth inning for a 3-1 lead.\nBut Posey aided in the Dodgers’ rally in the sixth, allowing Seager to score and Forsythe to take third on a passed ball. Forsythe then scored the game-tying run on Enrique Hernandez’s infield out.\nNeither starting pitcher got a decision.\nHill, who shut out the Giants for six innings in a 9-0 win last Sunday, allowed three runs and five hits in four innings. He walked two and struck out six.\nChris Stratton, the losing pitcher in Los Angeles last Sunday, gave up three runs, two of which were earned, in five innings. He allowed four hits and four walks and struck out three.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
