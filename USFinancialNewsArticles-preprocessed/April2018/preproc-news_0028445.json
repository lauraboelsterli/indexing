    "text": "20 COMMENTS PARIS—The French government published a dossier Saturday providing what it described as evidence that the Assad regime was behind a deadly chemical attack in Syria last week, in an effort to bolster France’s justification for conducting airstrikes over Damascus.\nThe seven-page report, released by the Foreign Ministry, said French intelligence services concluded with a “high degree of confidence” that the government of President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons in an attack on the town of Douma on April 7.\nThe report’s conclusions were drawn from witness testimony and photos collected by French intelligence, as well as from videos and photos posted on the internet that intelligence analysts deemed authentic. The report acknowledged France hasn’t been able to obtain chemical samples for analysis in its own laboratories.\nStill, France was in possession of a “body of evidence,” the report said, that showed “beyond possible doubt, a chemical attack was carried out against civilians at Douma on 7 April 2018; and that there is no plausible scenario other than that of an attack by Syrian armed forces as part of a wider offensive in the Eastern Ghouta enclave.”\nRELATED VIDEO U.S., British and French forces struck sites associated with Syria’s chemical-weapons capabilities on Friday. Video footage shows the missile launches and resulting damage. Above, a Syrian soldier films the damage. Photo: AFP/Getty French President Emmanuel Macron has been under pressure to back his claim earlier this week that France has “proof” the Assad regime had a role in the attack. Analysts say France’s decision to join the airstrikes with the U.S. and U.K. breaks with the country’s longstanding insistence that military action should be taken only when backed by the United Nations Security Council or other multilateral bodies like NATO.\nThomas Gomart, an analyst with the French Institute of International Relations, said the strikes were “defining” for Mr. Macron, because acting without a UN mandate “will invalidate some of this talk about defending multilateralism.”\nThe report states that “reliable intelligence” shows that Syrian military officials coordinated the Douma attack, using chlorine.\nFrench officials have “no information” to support theories that rebel forces were in possession of chemical weapons, the report said. It also said any claims that opposition forces manipulated images of the attack were “not credible,” because rebels in the area “do not have the resources to carry out a communications operation on such a scale.”\nThe dossier included three photos it said were collected locally on April 7, documenting the bodies of a woman and several children with skin burns and foaming mouths. The attack may have killed more than 40 people, the report stated.\nShared Force The U.S. fired the majority of the missiles against Syria in this weekend's attack. U.S.\n88 Missiles\nFrance\n9 Missiles\nUnited Kingdom\n8 Missiles\nSource: Department of Defense\nThe government said the allegations were backed by a pattern of previous attacks France attributes to the Assad regime.\nA year ago, while France was in the middle of presidential elections, French intelligence reported that a deadly sarin attack in northern Syria bore “the signature” of the Assad regime’s chemical weapons program.\nSince then, French services have found reason to believe that chemicals were used in 11 attacks in Syria. Most contained chlorine, while a nerve agent was used in an assault in November, the report said.\nWrite to Stacy Meichtry at stacy.meichtry@wsj.com and Nick Kostov at Nick.Kostov@wsj.com",
