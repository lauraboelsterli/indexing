We are certainly open to a two-party solution as a likely outcome,” he said at a news conference in Jordan after a visit to Israel.\n“The Israelis and Palestinians need to have political engagement. We urge the Palestinians to return to that political dialogue,” he added.\nU.S. President Donald Trump has said he would support a two-state solution if the two sides agree. The White House is preparing a new Israeli-Palestinian peace plan. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo shakes hands with Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi in Amman, Jordan, April 30, 2018. REUTERS/Muhammad Hamed\nPalestinians have rejected U.S. peace-making efforts since Trump decided to recognise Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and move its embassy to the city, wanted by Palestinians as capital of their own state.\nAmman was Pompeo’s last stop before he returns to Washington DC, where he has not yet entered the State Department. Moments after being sworn in as Secretary of State on Thursday, Pompeo immediately left for a meeting in Brussels, followed by a visit to allies in the Middle East.
