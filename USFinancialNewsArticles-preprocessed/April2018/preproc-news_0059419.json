The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” \"plan,\" “intend,” \"should,\" “estimate” and other expressions that are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and that do not relate to historical matters identify forward-looking statements. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Although forward-looking statements reflect management’s good faith beliefs, reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. Except as required by law, Milacron undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or otherwise. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to demand for our products being significantly affected by general economic conditions, any decline in the use of plastic, the competitiveness of the industries in which we operate and the financial resources of our competitors, our ability to successfully develop and implement strategic initiatives to increase cost savings and improve operating margins and the other risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as filed with the SEC on February 28, 2018, and other SEC filings, copies of which are available free of charge on our website at investors.milacron.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\"). To supplement this information, we also use the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share and Free Cash Flow. Because not all companies use identical calculations, these presentations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as further adjusted for the other items reflected in the reconciliation table set forth below. Adjusted EBITDA is a measure used by management to measure operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with U.S. GAAP, is not a measure of financial condition or profitability, and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings (loss) determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP or operating cash flows determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual non-recurring items. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for management’s discretionary use, as it does not include certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments, debt service requirements and certain other cash costs that may recur in the future.\nWe view Adjusted EBITDA as a key measure of our performance. We present Adjusted EBITDA not only due to its importance for purposes of our credit agreements but also because it assists us in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis as it excludes items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA:\nas a measurement used in evaluating our consolidated and segment-level operating performance on a consistent basis; to calculate incentive compensation for our employees; for planning purposes, including the preparation of our internal annual operating budget; to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational strategies; and to assess compliance with various metrics associated with our debt agreements.\nWe believe that the inclusion of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items as well as items considered to be one-time or non-recurring to the operations of the business. While we believe these financial measures are commonly used by investors to evaluate our performance and that of our competitors, because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered as an alternative to performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as net earnings (loss) before income tax expense, interest expense, net, depreciation and amortization further adjusted to exclude other items as reflected in the reconciliation table below.\nIn evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses such as those used in calculating Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by usual or non-recurring items. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using Adjusted EBITDA only supplementary.\nAdjusted Net Income\nAdjusted Net Income measures our operating performance by adjusting net earnings (loss) to exclude amortization expense, non-cash currency effect on intercompany loans, organizational redesign costs, long-term equity awards, acquisition integration costs, professional services and certain other non-recurring items. Management uses this measure to evaluate our core operating results as it excludes certain items whose fluctuations from period-to-period do not necessarily correspond to changes in the core operations of the business, but includes certain items such as depreciation, interest expense and interest tax expense, which are otherwise excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. We believe the presentation of Adjusted Net Income enhances our investors’ overall understanding of the financial performance and cash flow of our business. You should not consider Adjusted Net Income as an alternative to net earnings (loss), determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance.\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. We believe Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share is useful to investors because it measures our operating performance, on a per share basis, by adjusting net earnings (loss), on a per share basis, to exclude amortization expense, non-cash currency effect on intercompany loans, organizational redesign costs, long-term equity awards, acquisition integration costs, professional services and certain other non-recurring items. We believe the presentation of Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share enhances our investors’ overall understanding of the financial performance and cash flow of our business. You should not consider Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share as an alternative to earnings per share, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree Cash Flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities, plus proceeds from disposals of property and equipment, plus proceeds from sale-leaseback financing less cash used in additions to property and equipment. We believe Free Cash Flow is useful to investors because it measures the operating cash flow of the Company, excluding the capital that is spent to continue and improve business operations, such as investment in the Company's existing business. Further, Free Cash Flow provides an indication of the ongoing cash that is available for debt repayment, returning capital to shareholders and other opportunities. We also believe the presentation of this measure enhances investors' ability to analyze trends in the business and evaluate the Company's underlying performance relative to other companies in the industry. Limitations associated with the use of Free Cash Flow include that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it does not incorporate certain cash payments including payments made on the Company's indebtedness or cash payments for business acquisitions. You should not consider Free Cash Flow as an alternative to similar metrics, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance.\nMCRN-IR\nMILACRON HOLDINGS CORP.
