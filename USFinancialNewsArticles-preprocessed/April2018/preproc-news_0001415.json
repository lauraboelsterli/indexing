    "text": "(New throughout, updates prices to close)\nTORONTO, April 2 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index fell on Monday, led by energy and financial shares, as oil prices tumbled and investors worried about an escalating trade war between the United States and China.\n* The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index , which fell 5.2 percent in the first quarter, closed down 153.84 points, or 1.0 percent, at 15,213.45.\n* Losses for the index came as U.S. stocks plunged. Investors on Wall Street fled technology shares amid resurging trade worries.\n* China raised tariffs by up to 25 percent on U.S. products, in response to U.S. duties on aluminum and steel imports.\n* Eight of the index’s 10 main groups ended lower.\n* The energy group fell 2.2 percent as crude oil prices slumped. U.S. crude oil futures settled nearly 3 percent lower at $63.01 a barrel.\n* Financials declined 0.9 percent and information technology retreated 1.7 percent.\n* The largest percentage gainer on the index was Transcontinental Inc, which rose 9.7 percent, while the largest decliner was Prometic Life Sciences Inc, down 15.9 percent.\n* Gold futures benefited from demand for safe haven assets, rising 1.3 percent to $1,340.2 an ounce.\n* The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added 0.1 percent.\n* The TSX posted four new 52-week highs and 10 new lows.
