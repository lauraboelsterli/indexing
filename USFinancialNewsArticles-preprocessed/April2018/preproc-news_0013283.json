    "text": "April 8, 2018 / 9:02 PM / Updated 43 minutes ago Golf-Casey threatens course record before poor finish for 65 Andrew Both 1 Min Read \nAUGUSTA, Ga., April 8 (Reuters) - Paul Casey threatened the Augusta National course record on his way to a seven-under-par 65 in the final round at the U.S. Masters on Sunday. \nBogeys at the final two holes cost Casey a share of the record 63 held by Nick Price (third round, 1986) and Greg Norman (first round, 1996). \nThe Englishman accrued an eagle and seven birdies before his two dropped shots left a sour taste. \nIt was still his best score in 42 rounds at Augusta as he finished at five-under 283. \nCaseyâ€™s round was highlighted by a brilliant run as he picked up six strokes in five holes from the 11th. \nThe former world number three came into the Masters in sizzling form after his one-stroke win over Patrick Reed and Tiger Woods at the Valspar Championship in March.
