    "text": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican conglomerate Alfa posted a 14.4 percent rise in first quarter net profit on Wednesday, boosted by stronger margins and volumes in its polyester unit and higher domestic sales of processed food.\nThe company ( ALFAA.MX ), which competes in industries from food packaging to car parts to petrochemicals, said profit was 3.554 billion pesos ($194 million), compared to 3.106 billion pesos in the year-earlier quarter.\nRevenue rose across all the company’s different units, and overall was 5 percent higher at 85.850 billion pesos. After a tough 2017, Alfa’s share price has risen more than 6 percent so far this year.\nPetrochemicals unit Alpek, which in January announced a financing deal for troubled client M&G Polimeros Mexico, benefited from higher polyester prices. Packaged foods unit Sigma saw higher volumes in Mexico, Alfa said on Wednesday.\nThe company is hunting for a new Chief Financial Officer after Ramon Leal left the firm in March over a fine from country’s banking regulator for insider trading.\nAlfa expects to generate total revenue of $17.4 billion this year.\nReporting by Christine Murray; Editing by Anthony Esposito and Alistair Bell\n ",
