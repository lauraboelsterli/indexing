    "text": "(Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Blue Harbour Group LP CEO Cliff Robbins told a conference in New York on Tuesday that Canadian business information management software company Open Text Corp ( OTEX.TO ) could be acquired.\n“There is potential for a strategic sale down the road,” Robbins said during a presentation at 13D Monitor’s Active-Passive Investor Summit, adding that there has been significant consolidation in the software sector.\nOpen Text shares rose 4 percent to $35.95 on Tuesday.\nRobbins said that a company sale is “always possible in the software space.”\n“I think the return opportunity is significantly higher than this,” referring to where Open Text shares were trading.\nBlue Harbour owns a 3.49 percent stake in Open Text, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nAn Open Text spokeswoman declined to comment.\nReporting by Liana B. Baker and Svea Herbst in New York; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Phil Berlowitz\n ",
