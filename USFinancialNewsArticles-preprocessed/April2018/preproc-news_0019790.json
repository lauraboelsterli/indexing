Zuckerberg Faces House in Second Day of Facebook Testimony—Live Analysis Last Updated Apr 11, 2018 at 12:32 pm ET \nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before lawmakers on Capitol Hill Wednesday morning. Follow live updates. SHARE \nZuckerberg Faces More Questions About Bias \nCongresswoman Contrasts Strict Health, Financial Privacy Laws With Online Regulation \nFacebook's Zuckerberg Says Regulation of Industry 'Inevitable' \nZuckerberg’s Personal Data Sold to Cambridge Analytica \nFacebook 'Looking Into' Suing Cambridge Analytica \nSilicon Valley Congresswoman Aggressively Questions Zuckerberg See only Highlights Zuckerberg Denies Trump Campaign Got Preferential Treatment in 2016 \nRep. John Sarbanes (D., Md.) questioned Mr. Zuckerberg about the support Facebook provided both Mr. Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign — and why about 90 times more Trump campaign ads were approved than Clinton campaign ones. \nMr. Sarbanes said about 5.9 million Trump display ads were approved for Facebook during the campaign while 66,000 Clinton ads. The disparity \"raises some questions about whether the ad approval processes were maybe not processed correctly or inappropriately bypassed,\" he said. \n\"We offer sales support to every campaign,\" Mr. Zuckerberg said. \nFacebook sent staffers to help both campaigns buy Facebook ads. The Trump campaign’s ads drew more engagement on Facebook, in the form of clicks and other signals, than those of the Clinton camp, the Wall Street Journal has previously reported . \nMr. Zuckerberg said the Trump campaign didn't get any special treatment. \"We apply the same standard to all campaigns,\" he said. Byron Tau Twitter Congressman Calls for Facebook to Release Minority Employee Retention Stats \nRep. G. K. Butterfield (D., N.C.) asked Mr. Zuckerberg to quantify the retention of minority and female employees within his company, addressing an area the tech industry has struggled with. \nFacebook and other companies release annual diversity reports that describe the makeup of their workforces, but few release data around how long women and employees of color remain at their companies. \nDiversity and inclusion experts say retention is one of the most important aspects of increasing the representation of women and minorities within companies, but is often overlooked in favor of programs that emphasize recruiting more diverse slates of candidates for jobs. \nAccording to the Center for Talent Innovation, women continue to leave tech jobs at approximately twice the rate of men. Georgia Wells Twitter You Can Always Walk \nOne consistent part of Mr. Zuckerberg's answers about who controls data: people can always close their accounts. It's as if he is reminding lawmakers that Facebook is an optional service people don't have to join or continue using. Brian Fitzgerald Twitter Zuckerberg Faces More Questions About Bias \nOne of the persistent themes conservative Republicans have pressed in two days of hearings is the idea there is a potential bias against conservatives in the Facebook algorithm. \nMr. Zuckerberg faced a number questions about his company's decision to restrict distribution of content by Diamond and Silk, two prominent online African-American supporters of Mr. Trump, in two days of hearings. And he's also faced questions about whether conservative commentary or content is suppressed by the company's news feed in both the Senate hearing and in today's House hearing. \nMr. Zuckerberg has repeatedly denied there was any intent to suppress conservative speech. \n\"There is absolutely no directive in any of the changes that we make to have a bias in anything that we do. To the contrary, our goal is to be a platform for all ideas,\" he told lawmakers Wednesday. Byron Tau",
