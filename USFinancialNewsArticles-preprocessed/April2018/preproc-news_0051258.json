    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., April 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE: EW), the global leader in patient-focused innovations for structural heart disease and critical care monitoring, today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter and Recent Highlights:\nSales were $895 million, or $938 million on an adjusted basis Global THVT sales grew 2 percent; underlying 1 sales increased 12 percent EPS declined 9 percent, driven by special items; adjusted 1 EPS grew 30 percent 2018 adjusted EPS guidance raised to $4.50 to $4.70 from $4.43 to $4.63 CENTERA CE Mark received; U.S. pivotal trial approved Continued Access Protocol approved for PARTNER 3 Trial patients\n\"We are pleased with our start to 2018 with first quarter total adjusted sales of $938 million, consistent with our expectations. This represents 9 percent underlying sales growth, and positions us for 10 to 11 percent underlying sales growth this year,\" said Michael A. Mussallem, chairman and CEO. \"Therapy adoption of transcatheter heart valves once again drove the majority of our growth, aided by solid performance in our other product lines. Adjusted EPS grew 30 percent, even while investing aggressively and making significant progress in our transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapies. Most importantly, even more patients are benefiting from our life saving technologies than ever before.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nSales for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $894.8 million, up 1.3 percent. Total adjusted sales were $937.5 million, up 9.3 percent over the first quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.96 per share, while adjusted earnings per share grew 29.8 percent to $1.22.\nFor the quarter, the company reported Transcatheter Heart Valve Therapy (THVT) sales of $551.6 million, a 2.3 percent growth rate over the first quarter last year. Consistent with company expectations, adjusted THVT sales were $559.6 million, up 12.4 percent on an underlying basis including the adjustment for stocking inventory in Germany. The company continues to expect its THVT full year underlying sales growth rate to be at the higher end of 11 to 15 percent. TAVR growth is being driven by continued strong global therapy adoption, and the global average selling price remained stable.\nDuring the quarter, the company announced receipt of a CE Mark for the CENTERA system. In addition, the company announced today it received FDA approval to initiate a U.S. pivotal trial of the CENTERA system in severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis patients at intermediate risk of open-heart surgery. \"We look forward to launching this rigorous study to build robust evidence for this innovative, self-expanding valve system,\" said Mussallem.\nEdwards also received approval from the FDA for a limited continued access protocol for the PARTNER 3 Trial for low-risk patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis to allow for ongoing treatment. Data from the PARTNER 3 Trial is expected to be presented at ACC 2019, and FDA approval is anticipated late that year.\nSurgical Heart Valve Therapy sales for the quarter were $179.5 million, down 10.0 percent compared to the first quarter last year, or up 2.4 percent on an underlying basis. Adjusted results exclude a sales return reserve related to conversion to a consignment inventory model. Edwards' new products drove underlying sales growth at a rate higher than total procedure growth.\nCritical Care sales were $163.7 million for the quarter, representing an increase of 13.0 percent versus last year, or 8.4 percent on an underlying basis. This performance was driven by strong growth across the portfolio, led primarily by the HemoSphere advanced monitoring platform and strong regional performance in the U.S. and Asia Pacific.\nFor the quarter, the company's adjusted gross profit margin was 74.5 percent, compared to 75.7 percent in the same period last year. This reduction was driven primarily by the impact from FX, partially offset by a more profitable product mix.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 11.5 percent to $256.0 million for the quarter. This increase was driven by the strengthening of the euro against the dollar and personnel related expenses.\nResearch and development investments for the first quarter increased 11.3 percent to $143.2 million, or 16.0 percent of sales. This increase was primarily the result of continued investments in transcatheter heart valve programs, including spending on clinical trials.\nThe high reported tax rate of 21.6 percent for the quarter was driven by a $24.0 million reserve. Excluding the impact of this reserve and other special items, the tax rate would have been 13.2 percent. Edwards now expects its 2018 tax rate, excluding special items, to be between 13 and 16 percent.\nAdjusted free cash flow for the fourth quarter was $108.1 million, defined as cash flow from operating activities of $151.3 million, less capital spending of $43.2 million.\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $1.5 billion at March 31, 2018. Total debt was $1.1 billion.\nOutlook\nFor the full year 2018, Edwards remains confident in achieving the higher end of its sales guidance range of $3.5 to $3.9 billion. Additionally, the company now expects its estimate for 2018 adjusted earnings per share to be between $4.50 to $4.70.\nFor the second quarter 2018, at current foreign exchange rates, the company projects total sales to be between $950 million and $1.0 billion, and adjusted EPS of $1.05 to $1.15.\n\"We are confident in our outlook for continued strong sales growth, and we remain passionate about helping more patients around the world. We continue to focus on driving organic growth with leading innovative technologies, while aggressively investing in our future. Our foundation of leadership positions us well for continued longer-term success and greater shareholder value as we pursue multi-billion dollar market opportunities,\" said Mussallem.\nAbout Edwards Lifesciences\nEdwards Lifesciences, based in Irvine, Calif., is the global leader in patient-focused medical innovations for structural heart disease, as well as critical care and surgical monitoring.

Management makes adjustments to the GAAP measures for items (both charges and gains) that (a) do not reflect the core operational activities of the Company, (b) are commonly adjusted within the Company's industry to enhance comparability of the Company's financial results with those of its peer group, or (c) are inconsistent in amount or frequency between periods (albeit such items are monitored and controlled with equal diligence relative to core operations). The Company uses the term \"adjusted sales\" or \"underlying growth rate\" when referring to non-GAAP sales information, which excludes foreign exchange fluctuations, sales return reserves associated with transcatheter heart valve therapy (\"THVT\") product upgrades, the conversion to a consignment inventory system for surgical heart valves (\"SHV\"), and the positive impact of THVT stocking sales in Germany and the negative impact of de-stocking. The Company uses the term \"adjusted\" to also exclude intellectual property litigation income and expenses, amortization of intellectual property, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities arising from acquisitions, gains and losses from significant investments, impairments, litigation, the positive impact of THVT stocking sales in Germany and the negative impact of de-stocking, realignment expenses, sales return reserves and related costs associated with THVT product upgrades, the conversion to a consignment inventory system for SHV, charitable contributions to the Edwards Lifesciences Foundation, business development transactions, pension curtailment or settlement gains and losses, and the impact from implementation of tax law changes. Fluctuations in exchange rates impact the comparative results and sales growth rates of the Company's underlying business. Management believes that excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations from its sales growth provides investors a more useful comparison to historical financial results. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations has been detailed in the \"Reconciliation of Sales by Product Group and Region.\"\nGuidance for sales and sales growth rates is provided on an \"underlying basis,\" and projections for diluted earnings per share, net income and growth, gross profit margin, taxes, and free cash flow are also provided on a non-GAAP basis as adjusted for the items identified below due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting such items. The Company is not able to provide a reconciliation of the non-GAAP guidance to comparable GAAP measures due to the unknown effect, timing, and potential significance of special charges or gains, and management's inability to forecast charges associated with future transactions and initiatives.\nManagement considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure which provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by business operations, after deducting payments for capital expenditures, which can then be used for strategic opportunities or other business purposes including, among others, investing in the Company's business, making strategic acquisitions, strengthening the balance sheet, and repurchasing stock.\nManagement uses non-GAAP financial measures internally for strategic decision making, forecasting future results, and evaluating current performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the Company's operations by investors that, when viewed with its GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company's business and facilitate comparability to historical periods.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP; therefore, the information is not necessarily comparable to other companies and should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of non-GAAP historical financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided in the tables below.\nThe items described below are adjustments to the GAAP financial results in the reconciliations that follow:\nSHV Consignment Conversion - In the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a $34.7 million sales return reserve ($30.8 million, net of related costs) related to its conversion to a consignment inventory system for surgical heart valves.\nPension Curtailment Gain - The Company recorded a $7.1 million gain in the first quarter of 2018 related to the curtailment of its defined benefit plan resulting from the closure of its manufacturing plant in Switzerland.\nTHVT Germany Stocking Sales - In the first quarter of 2017, the Company recorded $61.8 million in net stocking sales ($48.0 million, net of related costs) to customers in Germany, as these customers elected to purchase additional inventory in anticipation of a potential supply interruption resulting from intellectual property litigation. In the first quarter of 2018, these customers consumed on a net basis $8.0 million ($6.0 million, net of related costs) of their stocking inventory.\nIntellectual Property Litigation Expenses, net - The Company incurred intellectual property litigation expenses of $5.7 million and $10.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration Liabilities - The Company recorded expenses related to changes in the fair value of its contingent consideration liabilities arising from acquisitions in the amount of $3.8 million and $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAmortization of Intellectual Property - The Company recorded amortization expense related to intellectual property in the amount of $0.6 million and $2.1 million in the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nProvision for Income Taxes - During the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a $24.0 million tax expense to adjust its estimated provisional amounts related to the implementation of U.S. tax law changes. The income tax impact of the expenses and gains discussed above is based upon the forecasted items' effect upon the Company's full year effective tax rate. Adjustments to forecasted items unrelated to these expenses and gains, as well as impacts related to interim reporting, will have an effect on the income tax impact of these items in subsequent periods.\nEDWARDS LIFESCIENCES CORPORATION\nUnaudited Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Information\n(in millions, except per share and percentage data)\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO ADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nGAAP Operating Income\n$\n252.5\n$\n298.3\nGrowth Rate %\n(15.4)%\nNon-GAAP adjustments: (A)\nSHV consignment conversion\n30.8\n—\nTHVT Germany stocking sales\n6.0\n(48.0)\nIntellectual property litigation expenses, net\n5.7\n10.2\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities\n3.8\n1.1\nAmortization of intellectual property\n0.6\n2.1\nAdjusted Operating Income\n$\n299.4\n$\n263.7\nGrowth Rate %\n13.5\n%\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO ADJUSTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nGAAP Diluted Earnings Per Share\n$\n0.96\n$\n1.06\nGrowth Rate %\n(9.4)%\nNon-GAAP adjustments: (A), (C)\nSHV consignment conversion\n0.12\n—\nPension curtailment gain\n(0.03)\n—\nTHVT Germany stocking sales\n0.02\n(0.17)\nIntellectual property litigation expenses, net\n0.02\n0.03\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities\n0.02\n0.01\nAmortization of intellectual property\n—\n0.01\nProvision for income taxes\nImpact of U.S. tax legislation\n0.11\n—\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\n$\n1.22\n$\n0.94\nGrowth Rate %\n29.8\n%\nNote: Numbers may not calculate due to rounding.\n(A)\nSee description of non-GAAP adjustments on the \"Non-GAAP Financial Information\" page.\n(B)\nThe tax effect on non-GAAP adjustments is calculated based upon the impact of the relevant tax jurisdictions' statutory tax rates on the Company's estimated annual effective tax rate, or discrete rate in the quarter, as applicable.
