    "text": "EditorsNote: Fixed story — changed Godley’s birthday from 29th to 28th (born in 1990)\nArizona center fielder A.J. Pollock had two hits including a homer and drove in two and Paul Goldschmidt had two extra-base hits and drove in a run as the Diamondbacks evened their weekend series Saturday with a 6-2 victory over the San Diego Padres at Chase Field.\nPollock’s fifth homer of the season broke a tie at two in the third inning, and Goldschmidt tripled in a run and scored in on Pollock’s RBI-single in a two-run seventh for the Diamondbacks (14-6), who have set a franchise record by winning their first six series.\nSan Diego right fielder Franchy Cordero had a two-run double off the center field fence in the first inning, but the Padres (8-14) could get only two other runners as far as second base.\nCordero, Christian Villanueva and Carlos Asuaje had two hits apiece for the Padres. Eric Hosmer struck out four times.\nRight-hander Zack Godley (3-1) gave up six hits and two runs in 5 1/3 innings while striking out eight and walking one. Godley, pitching on his 28th birthday, also had an RBI single in a two-run second inning.\nGoldschmidt added a double and Deven Marrero had two hits and scored twice. His one-out triple drove in a run and set up Godley’s RBI single\nSan Diego starter Clayton Richard (1-2) gave up five hits and three runs in five innings. He struck out six and walked three. Richard has 10 career victories against Arizona, his most against any opponent, but is 4-4 with a 6.12 ERA at Chase Field.\nCordero, who hit a 489-foot homer in a 4-1 victory Friday, hit a two-run double off the top of the center field fence with two outs in the first inning for a 2-0 lead. Jose Pirela beat out an infield single with one out in the first inning before Christian Villanueva singled with two outs.\nArizona tied it at 2 in the second inning when Chris Owings singled before Marrero’s triple. Godley’s two-out single tied it.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
