FILE PHOTO: Buildings housing the Varsity College, owned by Johannesburg-listed ADvTECH Group, are seen in Rondebosch, Cape Town, South Africa, September 22, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Hutchings \nFinancial details of the deal were not disclosed. \nADvTECH, along with rivals at home and abroad, has been expanding in Africa, where rising incomes have created a pool of customers willing to pay for private education. \nThe company is buying the schools from Scholé Ltd, a London-based education group which has been operating in Kenya and Uganda for six years. \nADvTECH, which operates high-end schools such as Crawford and Trinity House in South Africa, said the deal would add nine schools, five campuses and about 4,100 students to its portfolio.
