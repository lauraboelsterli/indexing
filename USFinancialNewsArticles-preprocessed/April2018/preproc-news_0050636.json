    "text": "WESTFORD, Mass., April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Ribbon Communications Inc. (Nasdaq: RBBN), a global leader in secure and intelligent cloud communications, today announced its financial results for the first quarter 2018.\n\"We are pleased with our first quarter results continuing the momentum we established at the end of last year. We've quickly established Ribbon as an innovative technology provider meeting the customers' demand for secure, real-time communications,\" said Fritz Hobbs, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ribbon. \"Announcing our first tier one customer for our recently launched Ribbon Protect security platform and strengthened partnerships with leading companies like Verizon and Microsoft, all serve as strong validation of the great progress we are continuing to make on our strategic initiatives.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights 1,2\nGAAP total revenue was $121.2 million, compared to $53.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP total revenue was $135.3 million, compared to $53.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. GAAP net loss was $44.9 million, compared to $10.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP net loss was $4.0 million, compared to $4.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. GAAP loss per share was $0.44, compared to $0.22 in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP loss per share was $0.04, compared to $0.09 in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA was $1.0 million, compared to negative $2.8 million in the first quarter of 2017. Cash and investments were $84.5 million at the end of the first quarter of 2018, compared to $83.3 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017.\nDaryl Raiford, Chief Financial Officer of Ribbon, added, \"We delivered solid first quarter results driven by the positive impact of our integration-related cost synergies. Our revenue performance disproportionally benefited profitability demonstrating the significant operating leverage we are building in our business. We remain fully committed to delivering $75 million of adjusted EBITDA in 2018 and exiting 2018 with an adjusted EBITDA run rate of at least $100 million.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Customer and Company Highlights\nRibbon announced a virtualized Session Border Controller as a Service (SBCaaS) solution with Verizon. The Verizon SBCaaS, powered by Ribbon, enables enterprises to dynamically respond to seasonal demands in a truly elastic operating expense model, helping them better manage their costs, adjust to changing business needs, and reduce their reliance on dedicated network hardware and potential points of network failure. The Company successfully completed a multi-site trial of its cloud unified communications offer in conjunction with one of its global channel partners for a large retail company in the US. Ribbon expects the agreement to be completed early in the second quarter of 2018. The company selected Ribbon because of its extensive experience in providing reliable cloud-based, multi-site business communications services. Ribbon completed the delivery of core products (softswitches and media gateways) for a tier one service provider in Asia that plans to significantly expand network capacity to accommodate its growing mobile subscriber base. Ribbon signed its first tier one service provider customer in the Asia/Pacific region for Ribbon Protect, the company's recently launched security product that provides advanced network analytics. Ribbon Protect provides visibility into networks and a large data behavioral analytics platform for real time communications networks and applications. The Company expects to recognize revenue from this customer in the second half of 2018. Microsoft selected the Ribbon Session Border Controller (SBC) portfolio to deliver secure, integrated voice services to Office 365's newest offering, Microsoft Direct Routing for Teams. As the migration to Teams ramps up late in the year and into next year, Ribbon expects a positive impact in its SBC portfolio. Leading market research firm IHS Markit ranked key solutions from Ribbon's core network modernization product set as market leaders in their respective categories. Ribbon's session border controller, media gateways and softswitch solutions all ranked either first or second in global market share according to IHS Markit.\n1 The Sonus-GENBAND merger occurred on October 27, 2017. The consolidated financial results included in this press release represent the consolidated financial results of Sonus Networks, Inc., prior to October 27, 2017, and the consolidated financial results of Ribbon, on and after such date. The financial results of GENBAND are included in Ribbon's consolidated financial results beginning October 27, 2017.\n2 Please see the reconciliation of non-GAAP and GAAP financial measures, and additional information about non-GAAP measures, in the press release appendix.\nConference Call Details\nRibbon will offer a live, listen-only webcast of the conference call to discuss the complete financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 on April 26, 2018, via the investor section of its website at http://investors.ribboncommunications.com , where a replay will also be available shortly following the conference call.\nConference call details:\nDate: April 26, 2018\nTime: 8:30 a.m. (ET)\nDial-in number: 800-705-8289 - International callers: +1-303-223-2689\nReplay information:\nA telephone playback of the call will be available following the conference call until May 10, 2018 and can be accessed by calling 800-633-8284 or +1-402-977-9140 for international callers.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nDiscussion of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nRibbon management uses several different financial measures, both GAAP and non-GAAP, in analyzing and assessing the overall performance of the business, making operating decisions, planning and forecasting future periods, and determining payments under compensation programs. Our annual financial plan is prepared both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, and the non-GAAP annual financial plan is approved by our board of directors. Continuous budgeting and forecasting for revenue and expenses are conducted on a non-GAAP basis (in addition to GAAP) and actual results on a non-GAAP basis are assessed against the annual financial plan. We consider the use of non-GAAP financial measures helpful in assessing the core performance of our continuing operations and when planning and forecasting future periods. By continuing operations, we mean the ongoing results of the business adjusted for acquisition-related revenue as a result of purchase accounting and the related cost of revenue, the impact of the new revenue standard, and excluding certain expenses and credits, including, but not limited to stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, settlement expense, certain litigation costs, acquisition-related facilities adjustments; acquisition- and integration-related expense and restructuring. While our management uses non-GAAP financial measures as a tool to enhance their understanding of certain aspects of our financial performance, our management does not consider these measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP measures. In addition, our presentations of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered alternatives for, or in isolation from, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nInvestors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In particular, many of the adjustments to Ribbon's financial measures reflect the exclusion of items that are recurring and will be reflected in our financial results for the foreseeable future.\nAcquisition-Related Revenue and Cost of Revenue; Impact of New Revenue Standard\nWe provide the supplementary non-GAAP financial measures, non-GAAP Product revenue, non-GAAP Service revenue and non-GAAP Total revenue, which include revenue related to the acquisition of GENBAND that we would have recognized but for the purchase accounting treatment of these transactions and eliminated revenue as a result of our adoption in 2018 of the new revenue recognition standard. Because GAAP accounting requires the elimination of this revenue, as well as the impact on future revenue of our adoption in 2018 of the new revenue standard, GAAP results alone do not fully capture all of our economic activities. These non-GAAP adjustments are intended to reflect the full amounts of such revenue and the related cost of revenue. We include these adjustments to allow for more complete comparisons to the financial results of our historical operations, forward-looking guidance and the financial results of peer companies. We believe these adjustments are useful to management and investors as a measure of the ongoing performance of the business. These adjustments do not accelerate revenue, but instead include revenue (and the related cost of revenue) that would have been recognized in our 2017 results, and included in our 2018 guidance and results, but for the purchase accounting and new revenue standard adjustments required by GAAP.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is different from other forms of compensation, as it is a non-cash expense. For example, a cash salary generally has a fixed and unvarying cash cost. In contrast, the expense associated with an equity-based award is generally unrelated to the amount of cash ultimately received by the employee, and the cost to us is based on a stock-based compensation valuation methodology, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types, all of which may vary over time. We evaluate performance without these measures because stock-based compensation expense is influenced by the Company's stock price and other factors such as volatility and interest rates that are beyond our control. The expense related to stock-based awards is generally not controllable in the short-term and can vary significantly based on the timing, size and nature of awards granted. As such, we do not include such charges in our operating plans, and we believe that presenting non-GAAP operating results that exclude stock-based compensation provides investors with visibility and insight into our management's method of analysis and the Company's core operating performance. It is reasonable to expect that stock-based compensation will continue in future periods.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nWe exclude the amortization of acquired intangible assets from non-GAAP expense and income measures. These amortization amounts are inconsistent in frequency and amount and are significantly impacted by the timing and size of acquisitions. Although we exclude amortization of acquired intangible assets from our non-GAAP expenses, we believe that it is important for investors to understand that intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. We believe that excluding the non-cash amortization of intangible assets facilitates the comparison of our financial results to our historical operating results and to other companies in our industry as if the acquired intangible assets had been developed internally rather than acquired. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized.\nSettlement Expense\nIn March 2018, we recorded $1.7 million of expense related to settlements, comprised of $1.4 million for the settlement of litigation in connection with our acquisition of Taqua LLC and $0.3 million of patent litigation settlement expense. These amounts are included as components of general and administrative expense. We believe that such settlement costs are not part of our core business or ongoing operations, are unplanned and generally not within our control. Accordingly, we believe that excluding costs such as the SEC potential fines and patent litigation settlement expense facilitates the comparison of our financial results to our historical operating results and to other companies in our industry.\nLitigation Costs\nIn connection with certain ongoing litigation between GENBAND, as plaintiff, and one of its competitors, we incurred litigation costs in the fourth quarter of 2017. In March 2018, we filed litigation on behalf of Sonus against the same competitor asserting additional intellectual property infringement and recorded $0.7 million of expense in connection with this litigation. We expect to incur significant future litigation costs related to these matters. These costs are included as a component of general and administrative expense. We believe that such costs are not part of our core business or ongoing operations, are unplanned and generally not within our control. Accordingly, we believe that excluding the litigation costs related to this specific legal matter facilitates the comparison of our financial results to our historical operating results and to other companies in our industry.\nAcquisition-Related Facilities Adjustments\nGAAP accounting requires that the deferred rent liability of an acquired company be written off as part of purchase accounting and that the combined company's rent expense on a straight-line basis begin as of the acquisition date. As a result, we recorded more rent expense than would have been recognized but for the purchase accounting treatment of GENBAND's assumed deferred rent liability. We include this adjustment, which relates to the acquisition of GENBAND, to allow for more complete comparisons to the financial results of our historical operations, forward-looking guidance and the financial results of peer companies. We believe these adjustments provide an indication of the rent expense that would have been recognized, but for the purchase accounting in connection with the acquisition of GENBAND.\nAcquisition- and Integration-Related Expense\nWe consider certain acquisition- and integration-related costs to be unrelated to the organic continuing operations of our acquired businesses and the Company and they are generally not relevant to assessing or estimating the long-term performance of the acquired assets. In addition, the size, complexity and/or volume of an acquisition, which often drives the magnitude of acquisition- and integration-related costs, may not be indicative of future acquisition- and integration-related costs. By excluding these acquisition- and integration-related costs from our non-GAAP measures, management is better able to evaluate our ability to utilize our existing assets and estimate the long-term value that acquired assets will generate for us. We exclude certain acquisition- and integration-related costs to allow more accurate comparisons of our financial results to our historical operations, forward-looking guidance and the financial results of less acquisitive peer companies. In addition, we believe that providing supplemental non-GAAP measures that exclude these items allows management and investors to consider the ongoing operations of the business both with and without such expenses.\nRestructuring\nWe have recorded restructuring expense to streamline operations and reduce operating costs by closing and consolidating certain facilities and reducing our worldwide workforce. We review our restructuring accruals regularly and record adjustments (both expense and credits) to these estimates as required. We believe that excluding restructuring expense and credits facilitates the comparison of our financial results to our historical operating results and to other companies in our industry, as there are no future revenue streams or other benefits associated with these costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to review and assess our performance. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA by excluding from net income (loss): interest income (expense), net; income tax benefit (provision); depreciation; and amortization of intangible assets. In addition, we exclude from net income (loss): adjustments to revenue and cost of revenue related to revenue reductions resulting from purchase accounting and adoption of the new revenue standard; stock-based compensation expense; settlement expense; certain litigation costs; acquisition-related facilities adjustments; acquisition- and integration-related expense; restructuring; and other income, net. In general, we add back the expenses that we consider to be non-cash and/or not part of our ongoing operations. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is used by our investing community for comparative and valuation purposes. We disclose this metric to support and facilitate our dialogue with research analysts and investors. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nWe believe that providing non-GAAP information to investors, in addition to the GAAP presentation, will allow investors to view the financial results in the way management views them. We further believe that providing this information helps investors to better understand our core financial and operating performance and evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by our management to evaluate and measure such performance.\nInvestor Relations:\nSara Leggat\n+1 (978) 614-8841\nsleggat@rbbn.com\nUS Press\nDennis Watson\n+1 (214) 695
