    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee passed legislation on Thursday to protect Robert Mueller, the special counsel appointed to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election from being fired by President Donald Trump.\nFour of Trumpâ€™s fellow Republicans joined every committee Democrat to pass the measure 14-7. However, the Republican leaders of the Senate have said they do not plan to allow a vote on the measure in the full chamber.\nReporting by Patricia Zengerle; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ",
