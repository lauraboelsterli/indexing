FILE PHOTO - Boxing - Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs Conor McGregor - Las Vegas, USA - August 26, 2017 Conor McGregor makes his entrance before the fight REUTERS/Steve Marcus/File Photo \nMcGregor, who became the first Ultimate Fighting Championship fighter to hold two world titles simultaneously when he beat Eddie Alvarez for the lightweight belt in Manhattan in 2016, turned himself in to police late on Thursday after the violent incident at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. \nPolice charged McGregor, 29, with three counts of assault and one count of criminal mischief, according to Lee Jones, an NYPD spokesman. \nMcGregor, who gave up plumbing to become one of his sport’s most recognizable and divisive stars, was due to be transferred to the criminal court in Brooklyn later on Friday for an arraignment hearing, Jones said. \nScores of news photographers and multiple broadcast trucks waited for a glimpse of McGregor leaving the police station in a quiet residential Brooklyn neighborhood. \nEfforts to reach McGregor’s representatives were not successful. It was not clear who would represent him in court. Related Coverage Mixed Martial Arts - Chaotic McGregor casts shadow over UFC 223 \nAs the UFC held a media day on Thursday ahead of upcoming fights at Barclays on Saturday, McGregor and his entourage entered through a side entrance and appeared to attack a van in which other fighters were riding. \nVideo footage of the fracas on social media showed objects being thrown at the van, and a number of people were injured by glass fragments as windows were smashed. \nMcGregor, who was born in Ireland and who previously told Reuters that he made $140 million from a boxing match with Floyd Mayweather last August, has not fought in a UFC bout since the win over Alvarez in November 2016. \nAside from his athletic success, McGregor is known for his beard and colorful tattoos, taste in expensive and flashy clothes, and aggressive taunting of opponents that stands out even among professional fighters. \nThe fighter has been caught up in violence outside the ring before. The Nevada Athletic Commission fined McGregor $25,000 after he threw water bottles at an opponent during a pre-fight news conference in 2016, the New York Daily News reported. \nUFC President Dana White said the van attack was “the most disgusting thing that ever happened in the history” of the UFC.
