    "text": "Pinch runner Johnny Field scored the decisive run from second base on an infield grounder with two out in the bottom of the 10th inning as the Tampa Bay Rays posted an 8-7 victory over the Minnesota Twins on Friday night at Tropicana Field.\nThe Rays had runners on first and second when Denard Span sent a bouncer to the right of Joe Mauer. The Minnesota first baseman gloved the ball and made the throw to left-hander Zach Duke (1-1) at first but Duke missed the bag and Span was ruled safe.\nMauer pointed toward home but Duke’s throw was off the mark and Field easily scored the game-winning run. The play was reviewed and it was confirmed Duke missed the bag and he was charged with an error.\nAlex Colome (1-2) pitched a perfect 10th for the Rays, who have won three of their past four games.\nMinnesota rallied from a 6-2 deficit after seven innings to take a 7-6 advantage in the ninth. Eddie Rosario delivered a game-tying grand slam in the eighth and Max Kepler hit a homer in the ninth off Rays left-hander Ryan Yarbrough.\nBut Twins right-hander Fernando Rodney was unable to hold the lead. Carlos Gomez was hit by a pitch with two outs and stole second before scoring the tying run on Brad Miller’s high-hopping single to center.\nLogan Morrison also homered for the Twins.\nSpan drove in three runs and Chris Archer tossed 6 2/3 strong innings for Tampa Bay. Adeiny Hechavarria reached base four times on two hits and two walks for the Rays.\nArcher gave up two runs and four hits. The right-hander struck out five and walked one.\nArcher departed after walking Eduardo Escobar with two out in the seventh. Left-hander Jose Alvardo struck out Kepler to end the inning and the Rays appeared to be in good shape after scoring three runs in the bottom of the frame to take a 6-2 lead.\nBut the Twins loaded the bases with one out in the eighth. Right-hander Sergio Romo struck out Miguel Sano but Rosario followed by going down to get an 0-2 pitch to hit the blast to right that knotted the score at 6.\nTwins right-hander Lance Lynn gave up five runs and seven hits in six-plus innings. Lynn struck out seven and walked five.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
