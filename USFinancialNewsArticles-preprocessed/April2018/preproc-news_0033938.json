    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning. Move over Don Draper, there’s a new creative director bouncing his way onto Madison Avenue. Kobe Bryant reportedly wrote and co-directed a new campaign for sports drink BodyArmor, which takes direct aim at its better-known competitor. “Thanks Gatorade. We’ll take it from here,” is the tagline. I’ll let you be the judge of whether Kobe’s got a chance of grabbing a Lion at Cannes next year. Watch it over on ESPN .\nWhat Does the Fox Say? The world of big media mergers has become increasingly crowded in recent months, but a new regulatory filing shows 21st Century Fox is sticking to its guns . As the WSJ reported, 21st Century Fox’s board rejected an acquisition offer for its entertainment assets from Comcast, even though the cable giant made a bid 16% higher on a per-share-basis than what Disney ultimately agreed to pay. Why? Fox’s board wasn’t keen on the potential of the kind of regulatory hold-up that AT&T and Time Warner are going through at the moment (to that end, catch-up here on Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes’s testimony from Wednesday, in which he argued that the merger is needed to take on Silicon Valley.) Also in the mix was Verizon, which showed some interest in making an all-stock bid for Fox assets. Fox, however, said that offer would have been “without any meaningful premium.” Elsewhere, the filing revealed Hulu is worth $8.73 billion—WSJ reporter Shalini Ramachandran reminded us on Twitter Netflix is worth more than $132 billion . (Another reminder: 21st Century Fox and Wall Street Journal parent News Corp share common ownership.)\nGroupe Think Amid all the disruption affecting the ad agency sector right now, Publicis Groupe was off to a good start in 2018, beating analysts’ expectations to post organic growth of 1.6% (versus the 0.3% expected) in its first quarter. Recent account wins—including Campbell Soup, Marriott, Mercedes-Benz and Carrefour—helped the French advertising group move in the right direction, although growth in its home market of Europe was largely flat. Of course, there were questions about the disruption at WPP, although Publicis CEO Arthur Sadoun opted not to comment. (That certainly wouldn’t have been the case under Maurice.) Fortunately there was lots of chatter about the forthcoming General Data Protection Regulation to liven up the call. The message from Publicis was that it’s not just ready, but that its acquisition of Sapient—and the “three and a half thousand” data scientists, analysts and engineers that came with it—puts the agency group in good stead to advise its clients on the new regulation.\nWho Are You? Who, Who, Who, Who? Marketers aren’t saying a whole lot publicly about their thinking on Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal and what impact it might have on their ad spending. But here’s a quirky anecdote in the New York Times’s temperature check on the ad community’s reaction . Ahalogy, a marketing tech firm, has been contacted in recent weeks by “almost a dozen” frustrated Facebook users demanding to know what the company is and why it has their contact information. The noise around the Cambridge Analytica story is prompting users to check their ad preferences and some users stumbled across Ahalogy on the list of advertisers with their contact information. Ahalogy buys ads for a range of marketers and often buys data from third-party firms, which explained why it showed up there. (Ahalogy says it doesn’t store the information, nor does it see personal data.) Imagine the fun after May 25 when people start finding out about a whole host of random companies previously unknown to them, pleading to gobble up their data. I’ll be waiting over here with popcorn.\nBittersweet Symphony GDPR is leading to casualties even before Europe can begin levying huge fines. The Drum’s Ronan Shields first reported that location-based mobile marketing firm Verve is closing its U.K. and Germany operations ahead of GDPR coming into force in May. While Verve International General Manager Ian James said GDPR wasn’t the only factor sparking the decision, he said it is now “challenging to have to operate any data-driven ad tech business in a highly legislated market.” GDPR, as all you marketing folks will know by now, will require companies to get more explicit consent from European users in order to use their data for advertising purposes. That’s a lot easier if you happen to be a company that has a consumer-facing brand. Verve says it always prioritized first-party data secured with consumer consent, but AdExchanger points out it’s still a bit fuzzy as to whether consumers fully know what they’ve opted into when they download and use an app that collects their location data.\nBest of the rest NBCUniversal is joining the “OpenAP” TV ad consortium, having initially been reluctant to join the audience targeting initiative. [ CMO Today ]\nOath hired Alibaba’s former global managing director, K. Guru Gowrappan, to become its president and chief operating officer. Simon Khalaf, a former Yahoo executive who went on to become Oath’s head of media brands, is leaving the company and won’t be replaced. [ Recode ]\nSnapchat is adding direct-response capabilities to its Sponsored Lens ad format that lets users tap a button to perform an action such as visiting a website or installing an app. [ Recode ]\nBuzzFeed breaks out the abacus and works out what an ad-free Facebook could cost. ($11 a month.) [ BuzzFeed ]\nAmazon’s annual shareholder letter revealed Prime has 100 million members globally. There isn’t a single mention of the word “advertising” in the letter. Sorry! [ Axios ]\nGoogle’s AMP stories beta is reportedly not progressing very quickly. [ Digiday ]\nAnd finally: The people have apparently spoken and Heinz plans to bring “Mayochup” to the U.S. It’s the end of days.
