(5) The March 2018 quarter reflected the reduced Federal income tax rate due to the new tax law.\nThe March 2018 quarter also included a $362 thousand reduction in income taxes, associated with the vesting of restricted stock under ASU 2016-09. Douglas L. Kennedy, President and CEO, said, “We had a good start to 2018, as we continued to execute on our strategic plan – Expanding Our Reach. Earnings per share growth was 24 percent over the same quarter last year and return on average equity was 10.54 percent for the first quarter of 2018.”\nHighlights for the quarter included:\nWealth Management remains integral to the strategy and diversified revenue sources:\n-- The March 2018 quarter included results from both Quadrant Capital Management, acquired November 1, 2017, and Murphy Capital Management, acquired August 1, 2017.\n-- At March 31, 2018, the market value of AUM/AUA at the Private Wealth Management Division of Peapack-Gladstone Bank (the “Bank”) increased $1.8 billion to $5.6 billion from $3.8 billion at March 31, 2017, reflecting growth of 47 percent. Organic growth was $500 million of the $1.8 billion in growth, while acquisitions accounted for $1.3 billion of the growth.\n-- Fee income from the Private Wealth Management Division totaled $8.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $3.5 million, or 74 percent, from $4.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\n-- Wealth management fee income, comprised approximately 22 percent of the Company’s total revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, contributed significantly to the Company’s diversified revenue sources.\n-- In addition to wealth income, also contributing to the Company’s diversified revenue sources is fee income related to loan level, back-to-back swaps, and gain on sale of SBA loans. (At March 31, 2018, there were approximately $3 million of SBA loans held for sale). The balance sheet growth was managed with a focus on Commercial and Industrial lending:\n-- Loans at March 31, 2018 totaled $3.71 billion. This reflected net growth of $272 million, or 8 percent, when compared to the $3.44 billion at March 31, 2017.\n-- During the second quarter of 2017, the Company hired a team of highly experienced bankers to focus on equipment financing. Net outstanding financings from this business totaled $178 million as of March 31, 2018, and were included in total commercial and industrial (“C&I”) loans.\n-- Total C&I loans at March 31, 2018 were $997 million. This reflected net growth of $309 million (45 percent) when compared to $688 million in C&I loans at March 31, 2017.\n-- The Company continued to manage its balance sheet such that lower yielding multifamily loans decline as a percentage of the overall loan portfolio and higher yielding C&I loans become a larger percentage of the overall loan portfolio. As of March 31, 2018, total C&I loans comprised 27 percent of the total loan portfolio, as compared to 20 percent a year earlier. As of March 31, 2018, total multifamily loans comprised of 37 percent of the total loan portfolio, as compared to 43 percent a year earlier.\n-- The Bank’s concentration in multifamily and investor commercial real estate loans declined to 446 percent of risk based capital at March 31, 2018 from 552 percent at March 31, 2017.\n-- Total “customer” deposit balances (defined as deposits excluding brokered CDs and brokered “overnight” interest-bearing demand deposits) totaled $3.30 billion at March 31, 2018. This reflected net growth of $143 million (5 percent) when compared to $3.16 billion of total “customer” deposit balances at March 31, 2017. During the March 2018 quarter, $66 million of listing service deposits matured – the Company has chosen to not participate in listing service programs at this time, so maturing listing service deposits are not replaced with new listing service deposits. Other net deposit outflows in the quarter were concentrated primarily in a small number of larger depositors, who remain clients of the Company.\nCapital and asset quality continue to be strong.\n-- Asset quality metrics continued to be strong at March 31, 2018. Nonperforming assets at March 31, 2018 were $15.4 million, or 0.36 percent of total assets. Total loans past due 30 through 89 days and still accruing were $674 thousand, or 0.02 percent of total loans at March 31, 2018.\n-- The Company’s and Bank’s capital ratios at March 31, 2018 all increased compared to the December 31, 2017 levels. These capital positions were benefitted by net income of $10.81 million and $10.62 million of voluntary share purchases under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan for the first quarter of 2018.\nSupplemental Quarterly Details:\nWealth Management Business\nIn the March 2018 quarter, the Bank’s wealth management business generated $8.37 million in fee income compared to $7.49 million for the December 2017 quarter, and $4.82 million for the March 2017 quarter.\nThe March 2018 quarter included a full three months of income related to Murphy Capital, which was acquired effective August 1, 2017, and three months of income related to Quadrant, which was acquired effective November 1, 2017. The March 2018 quarter included increased “recurring type” fee income (tied principally to asset management fees and custody fees), which was due to net inflows from new business, as well as additions to accounts from existing clients, partially offset by normal levels of disbursements and outflows.\nJohn P. Babcock, President of the PGB Private Wealth Management Division, said, “We continue to provide personalized, pro-active advice. Our new business pipeline continues to be strong and we expect continued growth through potential strategic acquisitions of wealth management firms, as well as organically.”\nLoans\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, total commercial and industrial loans grew $38 million (4 percent for the quarter, or 16 percent annualized) to $997 million at the end of the first quarter, compared to $958 million at end of year 2017. Additionally, commercial mortgage loans grew $17 million (3 percent for the quarter, or 11 percent annualized) to $644 million at the end of the first quarter, compared to $627 million at end of year 2017. This growth was principally funded by reductions in lower yielding multifamily and 1-4 family residential loans, as well as a partial paydown of a large investment credit line (included in consumer loans).\nMr. Kennedy said, “Our private banking business model addresses the needs and expectations of successful business owners and entrepreneurs. We have the capability to engage in high level strategic debt, capital and valuation analysis coupled with succession, estate and wealth planning strategies, enabling us to provide a unique boutique level of service.”\nFunding\nAs noted previously, during the first quarter of 2018, $66 million of listing service deposits matured - the Company has chosen not to participate in listing service programs at this time, so maturing listing service deposits are not replaced with new listing service deposits. Other net deposit outflows in the quarter were concentrated primarily in a small number of larger depositors, who remain clients of the Company.\nManaged reductions in the lower yielding multifamily, 1-4 family residential, and investment credit line loan portfolios of $48 million funded the increased higher yielding C&I portfolio ($38 million), and commercial mortgage portfolio ($17 million). Capital growth of $19 million and overnight borrowings of $216 million funded the matured listing service deposits of $66 million, other net deposit outflows discussed above of $80 million, increased on balance sheet liquidity (cash and securities) by $60 million, and maturity of FHLB advances of $15 million.\nIn addition to approximately $501 million of cash, cash equivalents and investment securities on its balance sheet, the Company also had approximately $1.3 billion of secured funding available from the Federal Home Loan Bank, of which $239 million was drawn as of March 31, 2018.\nMr. Kennedy noted, “The Company continues to focus on providing high touch client service, a key element in growing its personal and commercial core deposit base. The Company expects that our treasury management capabilities, including our new Treasury Management platform and our new escrow management product software, as well as added treasury management sales professionals and private bankers, will result in growth of commercial deposits.”\nMr. Kennedy added, “Our overall loan growth will continue to be governed by our continued ability to generate value-added core deposits, and by our in-house relationship-based loan profitability model used to manage the origination of loans with competitive risk-adjusted returns.”\nNet Interest Income / Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income and net interest margin were $28.39 million and 2.76 percent for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $28.59 million and 2.78 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017, and compared to $25.59 million and 2.71 percent for the same quarter last year. Net interest income for the first quarter of 2018 benefitted from loan growth as well as $433 thousand (approximately 4 basis points of net interest margin) of prepayment premiums received on the prepayment of multifamily loans, which reflected a decrease from $945 thousand (approximately 9 basis points of net interest margin) for the December 2017 quarter and a decrease from $515 thousand (approximately 6 basis points of net interest margin) in the March 2017 quarter. In addition, the March 2018 quarter included three months of the subordinated debt issued in mid-December 2017.\nNet interest margin for the first quarter of 2018 decreased when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, and increased from the same quarter of 2017. The increase from the first quarter of 2017 was due to the effect of the increased market rates on our adjustable rate assets, partially offset by an increase in our cost of deposits and lower prepayment penalties. The decrease from the previous quarter was due to the significantly higher prepayment premiums in the December 2017 quarter. The issuance of $35 million of subordinated debt issued in mid-December 2017 also negatively impacted net interest margin slightly in the March 2018 quarter.\nExcluding the effect of prepayment premiums, net interest margins would have been 2.72 percent, 2.69 percent, and 2.65 percent for the March 2018 quarter, December 2017 quarter, and the March 2017 quarter, respectively.\nThe Company’s interest rate sensitivity models indicate that the Company’s net interest income and margin would improve slightly in a rising interest rate environment. However, such income and margin may also be impacted by competitive pressures in attracting and/or retaining deposits.\nOther Noninterest Income\nThe first quarter of 2018 included $31 thousand of income related to the Company’s SBA lending and sale program, compared to $774 thousand generated in the December 2017 quarter, and $155 thousand in the March 2017 quarter. At March 31, 2018, there were approximately $3 million of SBA loans held for sale. Such loans were sold in early April at a gain of approximately $275 thousand.\nThe first quarter of 2018 also included $252 thousand of loan level, back-to-back swap income compared to $179 thousand in the December 2017 quarter and $456 thousand in the March 2017 quarter. This program provides a borrower with a fixed interest rate on a loan, while providing an adjustable rate to the Company, thus helping to manage the Company’s interest rate risk, while contributing to income.\nThe Company noted that income from both of these programs are not linear each quarter, as some quarters will be higher than others.\nThe March 2018 quarter included a negative $78 thousand mark to market adjustment of a CRA investment security which is classified as an equity security. Such security has been owned for years for CRA purposes, but under Accounting Standards Update 2016-01, Financial Instruments, equity securities now require a quarterly mark to market through the income statement.\nOperating Expenses\nThe Company’s total operating expenses were $23.34 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $24.25 million for the December 2017 quarter and $19.30 million for the March 2017 quarter.\nCompensation and employee benefits expense for the March 2018 quarter was $14.58 million compared to $15.30 million for the December 2017 quarter, and $11.91 million for the March 2017 quarter. The March 2018 quarter included a full quarter of expense related to the Equipment Finance team (who joined in April 2017) Murphy Capital (which closed in August 2017), and Quadrant (which closed in November 2017). Strategic hiring, normal salary increases and increased bonus/incentive accruals associated with the Company’s profitability and growth also contributed to the increase for the March 2018 quarter as compared to the March 2017 quarter. Additionally, the Company recorded expense of $1.3 million related to the separation of two senior officers in the December 2017 quarter.\nOther expenses for the March 2018 quarter were $4.91 million compared to $5.27 million for the December 2017 quarter and $3.89 million for the March 2017 quarter. The March 2018 quarter included a full quarter of other expenses related to the Equipment Finance business, Murphy Capital, and Quadrant. The December 2017 quarter included approximately $300 thousand of investment banking fee expenses related to the Quadrant acquisition. Further, when compared to the March 2017 quarter, the March 2018 quarter included increased advertising and marketing expenses relating to various target marketing campaigns.\nIncome Taxes\nThe March 2018 quarter included a reduced Federal income tax rate due to the new tax law signed in December 2017. The March 2018 quarter also included a $362 thousand reduction in income taxes, while the March 2017 quarter included a $662 thousand reduction in income taxes, both associated with the vesting of restricted stock under ASU 2016-09. The December 2017 quarter included a $1.60 million tax benefit from the reduction of the Company’s deferred tax liability due to the new tax law. The effective tax rate for the March 2018 quarter was 22.9 percent. Excluding the $362 thousand benefit associated with ASU 2016-09, the effective tax rate for the March 2018 quarter would have been 25.5 percent.\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses / Asset Quality\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company’s provision for loan and lease losses was $1.25 million, compared to $1.65 million for the December 2017 quarter and $1.60 million for the March 2017 quarter. The Company’s provision for loan and lease losses (and its allowance for loan and lease losses) reflect, among other things, the Company’s asset quality metrics, net loan growth and the composition of the loan portfolio.\nAt March 31, 2018, the allowance for loan and lease losses of $37.70 million (283 percent of nonperforming loans and 1.02 percent of total loans), compared to $36.44 million at December 31, 2017 (269 percent of nonperforming loans and 0.98 percent of total loans), and $33.61 million (292 percent of nonperforming loans and 0.98 percent of total loans) at March 31, 2017.\nNonperforming assets at March 31, 2018 (which does not include troubled debt restructured loans that are performing in accordance with their terms) were $15.4 million, or 0.36 percent of total assets, compared to $15.6 million, or 0.37 percent of total assets, at December 31, 2017 and $12.2 million, or 0.31 percent of total assets, at March 31, 2017. Total loans past due 30 through 89 days and still accruing were $674 thousand at March 31, 2018, compared to $246 thousand at December 31, 2017 and $622 thousand at March 31, 2017.\nCapital / Dividends\nThe Company’s and Bank’s capital positions in the March 2018 quarter benefitted by net income of $10.81 million and $10.62 million of voluntary share purchases under the Dividend Reinvestment Plan. Voluntary share purchases in the Dividend Reinvestment Plan can be filled from the Company’s authorized but unissued shares and/or in the open market, at the discretion of the Company – all of the share purchases in the March 2018 quarter were from authorized but unissued shares. The Company’s and Bank’s March 2018 and December 2017 regulatory capital positions were also benefitted by the mid-December 2017 subordinated debt issuance, and subsequent downstream of a large portion of the proceeds to the Bank as regulatory capital.\nThe Bank’s regulatory capital ratios are all above the ratios to be considered well capitalized under regulatory guidance.\nOn April 24, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.05 per share payable on May 22, 2018 to shareholders of record on May 8, 2018.\nABOUT THE COMPANY\nPeapack-Gladstone Financial Corporation is a New Jersey bank holding company with total assets of $4.34 billion as of March 31, 2018.

PEAPACK-GLADSTONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES RECONCILIATION\nTangible book value per share and tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets at period end are non-GAAP financial measures derived from GAAP-based amounts. We calculate tangible equity and tangible assets by excluding the balance of intangible assets from shareholders’ equity and total assets, respectively. We calculate tangible book value per share by dividing tangible equity by period end common shares outstanding, as compared to book value per common share, which we calculate by dividing shareholders’ equity by period end common shares outstanding. We calculate tangible equity as a percentage of tangible assets at period end by dividing tangible equity by tangible assets at period end. We believe that this is consistent with the treatment by bank regulatory agencies, which exclude intangible assets from the calculation of risk-based capital ratios.\nThe efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure of expense control relative to recurring revenue. We calculate the efficiency ratio by dividing total noninterest expenses, excluding ORE provision, as determined under GAAP, by net interest income and total noninterest income as determined under GAAP, but excluding net gains/(losses) on loans held for sale at lower of cost or fair value and excluding net gains on securities from this calculation, which we refer to below as recurring revenue. We believe that this provides one reasonable measure of core expenses relative to core revenue.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide information that is important to investors and that is useful in understanding our financial position, results and ratios. Our management internally assesses our performance based, in part, on these measures. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are supplemental and are not a substitute for an analysis based on GAAP measures. As other companies may use different calculations for these measures, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titles measures reported by other companies. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures of tangible common equity, tangible book value per share and efficiency ratio to the underlying GAAP numbers is set forth below.\nNon-GAAP Financial Reconciliation (Dollars in thousands, except share data) Three Months Ended March 31, Dec 31, Sept 30, June 30, March 31, Tangible Book Value Per Share 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 Shareholders’ equity $ 422,406 $ 403,678 $ 379,936 $ 356,847 $ 340,928 Less: Intangible assets, net 23,656 23,836 15,064 3,095 3,126 Tangible equity 398,750 379,842 364,872 353,752 337,802 Period end shares outstanding 18,921,114 18,619,634 18,214,759 17,846,404 17,579,274 Tangible book value per share $ 21.07 $ 20.40 $ 20.03 $ 19.82 $ 19.22 Book value per share 22.32 21.68 20.86 20.00 19.39 Tangible Equity to Tangible Assets Total assets $ 4,336,494 $ 4,260,547 $ 4,176,332 $ 4,165,679 $ 3,947,562 Less: Intangible assets, net 23,656 23,836 15,064 3,095 3,126 Tangible assets 4,312,838 4,236,711 4,161,268 4,162,584 3,944,436 Tangible equity to tangible assets 9.25 % 8.97 % 8.77 % 8.50 % 8.56 % Equity to assets 9.74 % 9.47 % 9.10 % 8.57 % 8.64 %\nThree Months Ended March 31, Dec 31, Sept 30, June 30, March 31, Efficiency Ratio 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 Net interest income $ 28,393 $ 28,586 $ 29,992 $ 26,972 $ 25,591 Total other income 10,215 10,606 8,831 8,171 7,019 Less: Gain on loans held for sale at lower of cost or fair value - 378 34 - - Less: Securities losses, net (78 ) - - - - Total recurring revenue 38,686 38,814 38,789 35,143 32,610 Operating expenses 23,337 24,251 21,961 20,095 19,304 Total operating expense 23,337 24,251 21,961 20,095 19,304 Efficiency ratio 60.32 % 62.48 % 56.62 % 57.18 % 59.20 % Contact:\nJeffrey J.
