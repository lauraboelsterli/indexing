    "text": "* Saudi Arabia seen seeking oil price of $80-$100 a barrel\nMarket expects renewed U.S. sanctions against Iran\n* U.S. commercial crude stocks decline towards five-year average\n* Some analysts see limits to bull market (Updates prices)\nBy Shadia Nasralla\nLONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - Oil prices kept rising to their highest since late 2014 as U.S. crude inventories declined, moving closer to five-year averages, and after sources told Reuters that top exporter Saudi Arabia aims to push prices even higher.\nBrent crude futures reached $74.73 a barrel, the highest since Nov. 27, 2014 -- the day OPEC decided to pump as much as it could to defend market share, sending the price to a low of $27 just over a year later.\nBrent futures were at $74.62 a barrel at 1145 GMT, up $1.14 from the previous close.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 98 cents to $69.45. WTI had earlier hit $69.56, its highest since Nov. 28.\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other major producers including Russia started to withhold output in 2017 to rein in oversupply that had depressed prices since 2014.\nOPEC and its partners will meet in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on April 20. OPEC will then meet on June 22 to review its oil production policy.\nReuters reported on Wednesday that top oil exporter   happy for crude to reach $80 or even $100 a barrel, which was viewed as a sign that Riyadh will not seek changes to the supply pact.\n\"The Saudis and their colleagues in OPEC need higher oil for their fiscal positions and the Kingdom is on a bold and costly reform programme. So they might continue to squeeze the lemon while they have the chance,\" said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.\nSince the start of the supply cuts, crude inventories have declined gradually from record highs towards long-term average levels.\nIn the United States, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday that commercial crude stocks fell close to the five-year average of about 420 million barrels.\nAlso supporting prices is the possibility that the United States might reimpose sanctions on Iran, OPEC's third-largest producer, which could result in further supply reductions from the Middle East.\nBut some analysts saw limits to the bull market.\n\"We feel we are at the point where further price support is unlikely unless there is an (unexpected OPEC) supply cut,\" said Georgi Slavov, head of research at brokerage Marex Spectron.\nPVM analysts also pointed to rising U.S. output and rig counts.\n\"Current oil prices are not justified by underlying oil fundamentals,\" they said.\n\"This is not to say that the current $74-plus Brent price is not vindicated by other factors, but based purely on global supply and demand data, prices should not be this high.\"\n(Additional reporting by Koustav Samanta and Henning Gloystein in Singapore, Nina Chestney in London; Editing by Toby Chopra and David Goodman)",
