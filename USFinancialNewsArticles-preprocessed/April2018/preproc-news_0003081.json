    "text": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - EnergyAustralia, a unit of Hong Kong’s CLP Holdings, said on Monday its previously announced takeover of power station operator Ecogen Energy from Australian pension fund giant IFM Investors for A$205 million ($157.36 million) is now formally sealed.\nEcogen owns two gas-fired power stations in the southern state of Victoria with a combined capacity of about 1,000 megawatts.\nThe purchase of Ecogen assets comes as gas prices soar, while state and national leaders brawl over carbon emissions targets and energy policy - factors that have spooked big infrastructure investors.\nAustralia’s competition regulator had reviewed the sale and given its permission in December.\nReporting by Alison Bevege, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ",
