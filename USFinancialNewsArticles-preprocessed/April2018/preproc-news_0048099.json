    "text": "LONDON, April 23 (Reuters) - Higher U.S. Treasury yields, a firmer dollar and softer commodity prices put some pressure on emerging markets on Monday with stocks at their lowest in nearly a week and currencies weakening.\nMSCI’s emerging market index weakened 0.6 percent after tech-heavy bourses in Asia racked up some of the steepest losses, with Taiwan dropping more than 1 percent to trade at its lowest in more than two months.\nThe falls come in the wake of markets cautiously watching U.S. bond yields creep higher to peaks that have roiled markets in the past. The rise in yields also lifted the dollar and weighed on commodity prices, with crude and copper futures softening, though staying not far off recent highs.\nThe market was also focused on the health of the global economy, though the latest batch of data showed that businesses across the euro zone kept their momentum as they headed into the second quarter, maintaining a still-solid but more modest growth rate.\n“I don’t think the global environment has changed. We are still in a relatively benign, a relatively strong global growth environment despite the recent slowdown, and as a matter of fact the preliminary PMIs that came out of the eurozone corroborate that story,” said Vasileios Gkionakis, co-head of strategy research at UniCredit.\nWhile emerging market dollar bond spreads held steady in the face of rising U.S. yields, currencies did feel the pinch.\nSouth Africa’s rand tumbled more than 1 percent and hit the weakest level in more than three months against the dollar as headlines on recent protests added to wider pressure.\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa appealed for calm on Friday after cutting short a visit to Britain and flying to the northern city of Mahikeng to try to quell an outbreak of violent demonstrations against poor public services.\n“The currency has appreciated over the past six months quite considerably – you are bound to see some squeezes in dollar-rand, especially when you see some headlines on protests and political bottelnecks,” said Gkionakis.\nRussia’s rouble and Mexico’s peso nearly matched those falls.\nMeanwhile Turkey’s lira, which has taken a battering in recent months, softened 0.3 percent as investors prepared for Turkey’s central bank to announce its latest decision on Wednesday following last week’s surprise election announcement.\nAnalysts polled by Reuters expect Turkish policymakers to hike interest rates at the meeting, with a 50 basis point increase in the top rate seen probable after President Tayyip Erdogan declared snap elections for June.\nMeanwhile Armenia’s dollar bonds traded at their lowest in at least 10 months after police detained three opposition leaders and nearly 200 protesters after demonstrations called on newly appointed Prime Minister Serzh Sarksyan to quit.\nThe protests, though peaceful so far, threaten to destabilise a key Russian ally in a volatile region.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see Emerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg\non year\nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1159.22 -9.02 -0.77 +0.07\nCzech Rep 1121.09 -0.17 -0.02 +3.98\nPoland 2303.75 +5.55 +0.24 -6.40\nHungary 38190.22 +67.35 +0.18 -3.01\nRomania 8953.00 +32.51 +0.36 +15.47\nGreece 848.00 +3.30 +0.39 +5.69\nRussia 1140.88 -4.92 -0.43 -1.17\nSouth Africa 50831.37 +65.49 +0.13 -3.24\nTurkey 10932.48 -1189.68 -1.06 -3.82\nChina 3068.80 -2.74 -0.09 -7.21\nIndia 34547.47 +131.89 +0.38 +1.44\nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local\nclose currency currency\n% change % change\nin 2018\nCzech Rep 25.39 25.34 -0.18 +0.56\nPoland 4.18 4.17 -0.19 -0.08\nHungary 311.15 310.65 -0.16 -0.20\nRomania 4.65 4.66 +0.03 +0.49\nSerbia 118.10 118.10 +0.00 +0.25\nRussia 61.93 61.38 -0.89 -6.90\nKazakhstan 327.16 326.51 -0.20 +1.72\nUkraine 26.12 26.16 +0.17 +7.77\nSouth Africa 12.26 12.09 -1.41 +0.79\nKenya 99.90 99.95 +0.05 +3.20\nIsrael 3.54 3.53 -0.36 -1.75\nTurkey 4.10 4.08 -0.51 -7.51\nChina 6.31 6.29 -0.18 +3.18\nIndia 66.38 66.20 -0.26 -3.83\nBrazil 3.41 3.41 -0.01 -2.95\nMexico 18.68 18.52 -0.87 +5.17\nDebt Index Strip Spd Chg %Rtn Index\nSov’gn Debt EMBIG 316 -2 .12 7 87.64 1\nReporting by Karin Strohecker, graphic by Claire Milhench Editing by Gareth Jones\n ",
