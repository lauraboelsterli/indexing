    "text": "Highlights for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2018 (all comparisons in this document refer to the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, except as noted)\nNet income and adjusted net income 1 were both $40.5 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, for the second quarter, compared to net income of $29.2 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, and adjusted net income 1 of $42.8 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, which excludes a nonrecurring charge to provision for income taxes related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 Net interest margin and adjusted net interest margin 1, 2 were 3.92% and 3.86%, increases of 3 and 6 basis points, respectively The Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, an increase of 25.0% compared to the most recent quarterly dividend, which reflects the benefits of the federal tax reform and our strong 1.40% return on assets The efficiency ratio 1 was 48.6% for the quarter and 47.2% for fiscal year-to-date Total loans increased $172.9 million, or 1.9%, to $9.34 billion while total deposits grew by $362.8 million, or 4.0%, to $9.39 billion Net charge-offs recognized during the quarter were 0.17% of average total loans on an annualized basis, a reduction compared to the previous five quarters\nSIOUX FALLS, S.D.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Great Western Bancorp, Inc. ( NYSE: GWB ) today reported net income of $40.5 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to net income of $29.2 million, or $0.49 per diluted share. Adjusted net income 1 , which excludes the deferred tax revaluation triggered by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, was $40.5 million, or $0.69 per diluted share, compared to $42.8 million, or $0.72 per diluted share.\n\"The second quarter of fiscal year 2018 was another solid quarter for Great Western,\" said Ken Karels, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We continued to see good demand from our loan portfolio, mitigated the rising cost of deposits through increasing loan yields pricing, continued to manage expenses well and increased our dividend due to the peer leading return on capital from our business.\"\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin 2\nNet interest income was steady at $102.2 million for both the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 and the prior quarter. Higher loan interest income, driven by 2.4% growth in average loans outstanding and a 10 basis point increase in the yield on loans, was offset by higher interest expense associated with a 9 basis point increase in the cost of deposits and a 12 basis point increase in the cost of borrowings.\nNet interest margin was 3.92% and 3.89%, respectively, for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Adjusted net interest margin 1 , which adjusts for the realized gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, was 3.86% and 3.80%, respectively, for the same periods. The yield on interest-earning assets increased by 12 basis points and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased by 10 basis points. A $0.8 million reduction in the cost of interest rate swaps was the primary driver of a more pronounced increase in adjusted net margin 1 compared to net interest margin.\nTotal loans outstanding were $9.34 billion as of March 31, 2018, an increase of $172.9 million, or 1.9%, for the quarter, and 7.7% on an annualized basis. The majority of the growth during the quarter occurred in the commercial real estate (\"CRE\") segment of the portfolio, which increased by $172.1 million, including strong growth in non-owner-occupied CRE and construction loans. Commercial non-real estate loans increased by $71.9 million, which was partially offset by a decrease of $57.5 million in residential real estate.\nTotal deposits grew to $9.39 billion as of March 31, 2018, an increase of $362.8 million, or 4.0%, during the quarter. Noninterest-bearing deposits were $1.85 billion, a 4.0% decrease, for the quarter and interest-bearing deposits were $7.53 billion, a 6.2% increase for the quarter. FHLB and other borrowings decreased by $170.0 million, or 23.6%, as a result of deposit growth.\n1 This is a non-GAAP measure management believes is helpful to understanding trends in the business that may not be fully apparent based only on the most comparable GAAP measure. Further information on this measure and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure is provided at the end of this release. 2\nAll references to net interest income and net interest margin are presented on a fully-tax equivalent basis unless otherwise noted. Provision for Loan and Lease Losses and Asset Quality\nProvision for loan and lease losses was $4.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, an increase of $0.3 million, or 7.5%. Net charge-offs for the second quarter were $3.8 million, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 0.17% of average total loans on an annualized basis, with the majority of net charge-offs concentrated in the CRE, commercial non-real estate and agriculture segments of the loan portfolio. The ratio of allowance for loan and lease losses (\"ALLL\") to total loans remained stable at 0.70% at both March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nIncluded within total loans are approximately $921.0 million of loans for which management has elected the fair value option. These loans are excluded from the ALLL process, but management has estimated that approximately $7.5 million of the fair value adjustment for these loans relates to credit risk, or 0.08% of total loans. Finally, total purchase discount remaining on all acquired loans equates to 0.25% of total loans.\nAt March 31, 2018, loans graded \"Watch\" and \"Substandard\" were relatively stable with modest increases of $7.4 million, or 2.6% and $3.7 million, or 1.5%, respectively. Nonaccrual loans were $131.3 million as of March 31, 2018, representing a decrease of $16.1 million during the quarter primarily driven by charge offs and transfers to other repossessed property. Total other repossessed property balances were $16.7 million as of March 31, 2018, an increase of $6.2 million, or 59.5% from historically low levels, due to three larger relationships moving into other repossessed property during the quarter.\nTotal credit-related charges increased compared to the previous quarter and decreased compared to the first six months of fiscal year 2017. A summary of total credit-related charges incurred during the current, prior and comparable quarters and current and prior six-month periods is presented below:\nGREAT WESTERN BANCORP, INC. Summary of Credit-Related Charges (Unaudited) For the six months ended: For the three months ended: March 31, March 31, March 31, December 31,\nMarch 31, Item Included within F/S Line Item(s): 2018 2017 2018 2017\n2017 (dollars in thousands) Provision for loan and lease losses Provision for loan and lease losses $9,457 $11,058 $4,900 $4,557 $4,009 Net other repossessed property charges Net loss on repossessed property and other related expenses 1,214 1,056 1,000 214 397 Reversal (recovery) of interest income on nonaccrual loans Interest income on loans 911 (99) (157) 1,068 (25) Loan fair value adjustment related to credit Net increase (decrease) in fair value of loans at fair value 320 289 1,358 (1,038) (251) Total\n$11,902 $12,304 $7,101 $4,801 $4,130 Noninterest Income\nNoninterest income was $18.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, an increase of $2.1 million, or 12.4%. Other noninterest income increased by $2.7 million, with the majority of this increase generated by a sign on bonus for a new contract offset by an estimated breakage cost on a prior contract included in noninterest expense as discussed below, partially offset by a $1.1 million reduction in service charges and other fees related to seasonality declines in net overdraft and non-sufficient funds income and crop insurance income in the current quarter. Also included within noninterest income is the net effect of the change in fair value loans for which the Company has elected the fair value option and the net gain (loss), realized and unrealized, of the related derivatives which generated a $0.8 million favorable change over the prior quarter.\nNoninterest Expense\nTotal noninterest expense was $59.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, an increase of $4.3 million, or 7.8%. Within noninterest expense is the estimated breakage cost of $2.3 million, offset by a sign on bonus for a new contract within noninterest income. Excluding this item, noninterest expenses were $56.9 million, an increase of $2.0 million, or 3.7%. This increase was driven by salaries and employee benefits, which increased $0.8 million due to the previously announced living wage increases brought on by federal tax reform and annual merit increases in the current quarter, and a net loss on repossessed property and other related expenses, which were $0.8 million higher due to the settlement of a single other repossessed property.\nThe efficiency ratio 1 was 48.6% for the quarter, an increase from 45.8%, as a result of a sign on bonus for a new contract offset by a one time breakage cost on a prior contract as discussed in noninterest revenue and expense above. This added approximately 0.8% to the efficiency ratio during the quarter.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes for the second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $14.7 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 26.6%, compared to an effective tax rate of 49.5% for the prior quarter. Excluding the nonrecurring deferred taxes adjustment related to federal tax reform, the prior quarter effective tax rate was 26.0%.\nCapital\nTier 1 and total capital ratios were 11.5% and 12.5%, respectively, as of March 31, 2018, compared to 11.3% and 12.3%, respectively. The common equity tier 1 capital ratio was 10.7% as of March 31, 2018 compared to 10.5%. The tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.4% and 10.3% as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. All regulatory capital ratios remain above regulatory minimums to be considered \"well capitalized.\"\nOn April 26, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.25 per common share payable on May 23, 2018 to stockholders of record as of close of business on May 11, 2018. This represents a 25.0% increase compared to $0.20 the dividend declared in January 2018, which the Board of Directors felt was appropriate based on the impact of tax reform on earnings. The aggregate dividend payment will be approximately $14.7 million.\nBusiness Outlook\n\"We remain very satisfied with the performance of our business and confident on performance for the remainder of the fiscal year,\" added Karels. \"We see good loan pipelines and loan demand post the tax stimulus. We expect to see increased pressure on deposit pricing but will continue to mitigate this through increased asset pricing. We remain confident that we will see loan growth in the mid to high single digit range for the fiscal year.\"\nConference Call\nGreat Western Bancorp, Inc. will host a conference call to discuss its financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 on Thursday, April 26, 2018 at 7:30 AM (CT).

We believe that each of the non-GAAP measures presented is helpful in highlighting trends in our business, financial condition and results of operations which might not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on our financial results calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. We disclose net interest income and related ratios and analysis on a taxable-equivalent basis, which may also be considered non-GAAP financial measures. We believe this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. In addition, certain performance measures, including the efficiency ratio and net interest margin utilize net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis.\nIn particular, we evaluate our profitability and performance based on our adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per common share, tangible net income and return on average tangible common equity. Our adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per common share exclude the after-tax effect of items with a significant impact to net income that we do not believe to be recurring in nature, (e.g., one-time acquisition expenses as well as the effect of revaluation of deferred taxes). Our tangible net income and return on average tangible common equity exclude the effects of amortization expense relating to intangible assets and related tax effects from the acquisition of us by National Australia Bank Limited (\"NAB\") and our acquisitions of other institutions. We believe these measures help highlight trends associated with our financial condition and results of operations by providing net income and return information excluding significant nonrecurring items (for adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share) and based on our cash payments and receipts during the applicable period (for tangible net income and return on average tangible common equity).\nWe also evaluate our profitability and performance based on our adjusted net interest income, adjusted net interest margin, adjusted interest income on non ASC 310-30 loans and adjusted yield on non ASC 310-30 loans. We adjust each of these four measures to include the current realized gain (loss) of derivatives we use to manage interest rate risk on certain of our loans, which we believe economically offsets the interest income earned on the loans. Similarly, we evaluate our operational efficiency based on our efficiency ratio, which excludes the effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangibles (a non-cash expense item) and includes the tax benefit associated with our tax-advantaged loans.\nWe evaluate our financial condition based on the ratio of our tangible common equity to our tangible assets and the ratio of our tangible common equity to common shares outstanding. Our calculation of this ratio excludes the effect of our goodwill and other intangible assets. We believe this measure is helpful in highlighting the common equity component of our capital and because of its focus by federal bank regulators when reviewing the health and strength of financial institutions in recent years and when considering regulatory approvals for certain actions, including capital actions. We also believe the ratio of our tangible common equity to common shares outstanding is helpful in understanding our stockholders’ relative ownership position as we undertake various actions to issue and retire common shares outstanding.\nReconciliations for each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the closest GAAP financial measures are included in the tables below. Each of the non-GAAP measures presented should be considered in context with our GAAP financial results included in this release.\nGREAT WESTERN BANCORP, INC.
