    "text": "April 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating if Chinese tech company Huawei Technologies Co violated U.S. sanctions in relation to Iran, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.\nIt is uncertain as to how far the DoJ probe has advanced to and what allegations the federal agents are exploring, the Journal said here , citing people familiar with the matter.\nU.S. authorities last week banned American companies from sales to China’s ZTE Corp for seven years, saying the Chinese company had broken a settlement agreement with repeated false statements - a move that threatens to cut off ZTE’s supply chain.\nThe action was sparked by ZTE’s violation of an agreement that was reached after it was caught illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran.\nThe DoJ declined to comment, while Huawei was not immediately available for comment.
