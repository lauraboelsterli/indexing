    "text": "Program leverages personalized care delivery to help members with hemophilia live healthy, vibrant lives.\nSCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Magellan Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGLN) today announced that Magellan Rx Management, the pharmacy benefit management division of the company, has released results from the first six months of its hemophilia management program launched in collaboration with Health New England, a non-profit health plan serving the commercial, Medicaid and Medicare markets.\nHemophilia is a rare genetic bleeding disorder, for which treatment is expensive and difficult to manage. The average annual cost per member with severe hemophilia can exceed $250,000, and may be upward of $1 million for members who have developed inhibitors. Personalized care programs for patients with hemophilia aim to reduce unnecessary costs while improving the overall quality of care.\n“As April 17 is World Hemophilia Day, we’re excited to bring hemophilia care into the spotlight and highlight the early results achieved with Health New England through our hemophilia management program,” said Haita Makanji, vice president, clinical specialty solutions at Magellan Rx Management. “Through personalized interventions, we’re able to better determine the individual member needs and coordinate across key stakeholders to deliver a truly personalized care program that ensures members with hemophilia receive best-in-class care and achieve optimal outcomes.”\nSince launching the hemophilia management program in August 2017, Magellan Rx Management and Health New England have standardized care across various stakeholders without compromising patient outcomes, resulting in:\nOptimized doses through assay management or pharmacokinetic (PK) testing in 50 percent of members Reduced average assay dispensed in prophylaxis patients from 5 percent to 1 percent, reducing the potential for waste No breakthrough bleeding reported from members who had a dose reduction\n“In the past eight months of collaboration with Magellan, we’ve achieved our goals of ensuring high quality of care for members with hemophilia while minimizing potential waste created through excess dispensing and inappropriate dosing,” said Andrew J. Colby, R.Ph, MBA, Health New England's pharmacy director. “By announcing our hemophilia management program results on World Hemophilia Day, we hope to raise the profile of this condition and look to continue to make strides in standardizing best treatment practices to benefit members across the country.”\nThe hemophilia management program aims to enhance overall quality and personalization of hemophilia care by coordinating with prescribers, members and pharmacies while reducing unnecessary costs. Key elements include:\nHelping payers analyze information related to member bleed history and hemophilia treatment patterns. Standardizing dispensing and optimal dose protocols to promote best practices and improve transparency in hemophilia care. Updating policies to encourage individualized treatment regimens based on member-specific metabolic factors.\nAbout Health New England: Based in Springfield, Mass., Health New England is a non-profit health plan serving members in Massachusetts and Connecticut.
