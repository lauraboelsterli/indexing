Gilla Kaplan, Ph.D., Celgene’s longest-standing Director, is retiring from the Board and will not stand for reelection at the upcoming Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held on June 13, 2018. Patricia “Pat” Hemingway Hall and Hans Bishop have been elected to Celgene’s Board of Directors.\nDr. Kaplan has served as Director since April 1998. She has provided important scientific perspective and leadership from her distinguished career in medical research, including her current role as Director of the Global Health Program for Tuberculosis at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\nMs. Hemingway Hall has more than 30 years of experience with a focus on the US health insurance market. She most recently was CEO of Health Care Service Corporation (HCSC), the nation’s largest mutual health insurance company, which operates as Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Illinois, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas, from 2008 until her retirement in 2015.\nMr. Bishop is a 30-year industry veteran and was most recently President and CEO of Juno Therapeutics, a cellular immunotherapy company that he co-founded in 2013 and led until Juno was acquired by Celgene in March 2018.\n“The changes announced today strengthen corporate governance by refreshing our Board of Directors and improving strategic insight provided to management in areas critical to our future success,” said Mark J. Alles, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Celgene Corporation. “Pat’s deep understanding of the US market access landscape will help to shape Celgene’s strategy in an increasingly complex environment. Hans is a pioneer in the field of cellular immunotherapy whose expertise will help Celgene lead in this extremely promising area of science.”\n“Dr. Kaplan’s contributions to the Celgene Board of Directors have been invaluable. In addition to her unparalleled scientific proficiency, she helped guide Celgene’s growth into a global organization throughout her 20 years as an independent Director. We thank Dr. Kaplan for her service and wish her all the best,” said Michael D. Casey, Celgene's Lead Independent Director and Chairman of the Nominating, Governance & Compliance Committee. “Looking ahead, Pat and Hans are strategically important additions to the Board with highly relevant experience in the areas of market access and cellular immunotherapy.”\nAbout Patricia Hemingway Hall\nPatricia “Pat” Hemingway Hall has more than 30 years of experience with a focus on the US insurance market.
