    "text": "(Reuters) - China’s ZTE Corp said on Wednesday it planned to take “certain actions” under U.S. laws following a ban by the U.S. government on American firms doing business with the company.\nA ZTE smart phone is pictured in this illustration taken April 17, 2018. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/Illustration The U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security earlier this month banned American companies from selling to ZTE for seven years, saying the Chinese company had broken a settlement agreement with repeated false statements.\nThe mobile phone and telecoms company said its shares will remain suspended on the Hong Kong exchange. It did not specify what actions it would take.\nReporting by Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva\n ",
