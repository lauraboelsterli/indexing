    "text": "1 COMMENTS California Water Service Group CWT 1.40% has made a takeover offer for water utility SJW Group, according to people familiar with the matter, possibly setting up a rare four-way bidding war.\nSJW last month agreed to a $750 million merger with Connecticut Water Service Inc. Last week, Connecticut Water said it received an offer from Eversource Energy , ES 1.09% which it rejected.\nNow there is an interloper on the SJW side too, which the company noted in a securities filing Wednesday without naming the party. According to the people, the bidder is California Water. Its cash bid, worth $68.25 a share and made April 4, was also rejected, the filing said.\nSJW stock closed Wednesday at $56.90.\nThe merger scrum is unusual in a number of respects. There are few precedents for an announced deal that faces bids to break it up on both sides. The SJW-Connecticut Water deal would be the first such tie-up in some 20 years in the tightly regulated water industry.\nFor California Water or Eversource to succeed, they likely would need to raise their offers and win the backing of their respective targets; companies rarely succeed in hostile bids in regulated industries.\nThe frenzied bidding war is an illustration of how a merger announcement, even in a sleepy industry, can jolt other companies into action and kick off a wave of consolidation.\nIn 2015, for example, semiconductor companies underwent a feverish round of deal making after decades of low levels of merger volume. There were more than $100 billion of semiconductor deals that year. The health-insurance industry is currently in the throes of a similar round of consolidation after years of shying away from mergers.\nSJW and subsidiaries including San Jose Water serve more than one million people in and around San Jose, Calif., and Canyon Lake, Texas. California Water, like SJW based in San Jose, is the third-biggest publicly traded water utility in the U.S., according to its website. The company operates in California, Washington, New Mexico and Hawaii.\nConnecticut Water provides water to more than 450,000 people in Connecticut and Maine and wastewater services to more than 10,000 people in Connecticut.\nA combined SJW-Connecticut Water would be the third-largest U.S. water and wastewater utility based on rate base and enterprise value. American Water Works Co. and Aqua America Inc. are the first- and second-largest.\nEversource is an electric and natural-gas utility in New England that among its operations supplies water to about 4 million customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.\nWrite to Dana Cimilluca at dana.cimilluca@wsj.com and Dana Mattioli at dana.mattioli@wsj.com",
