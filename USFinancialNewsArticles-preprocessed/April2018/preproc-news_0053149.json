    "text": "MONROE, Mich., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nMBT Financial Corp. (NASDAQ:MBTF), the parent company of Monroe Bank & Trust, reported a preliminary net profit of $3,902,000 ($0.17 per share, basic and diluted), in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a profit of $3,180,000 ($0.14 per share, basic and diluted), in the first quarter of 2017. The company also announced that it will pay a quarterly dividend of $0.07 cents per common share on May 17, 2018 to shareholders of record as of May 10, 2018. This is an increase of $0.01 per share compared to the dividend paid last quarter and an increase of $0.02 compared to the dividend paid in the same quarter last year.\nThe Net Interest Income for the first quarter of 2018 increased $941,000, or 9.8% as the net interest margin improved from 3.21% in the first quarter of 2017 to 3.52% in the first quarter of 2018 as higher interest rates and shifting from investment securities to loans improved the yield on earning assets.\nThe provision for loan losses was a negative expense of $100,000 for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $100,000 compared to last year’s first quarter, when a negative expense of $200,000 was recorded. Asset quality and historical loss ratios improved, but the growth in the loan portfolio reduced the size of the negative provision expense required to adjust the Allowance for Loan Losses. Total Loans increased $27.3 million, or 3.9% during the first quarter of 2018, and $59.2 million, or 8.9% compared to a year ago. Even though the bank recorded a negative provision for loan losses, the recovery of previously charged off loans caused the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses to increase from $7.7 million at the end of 2017 to $7.9 million at the end of the first quarter of 2018. Due to the loan growth, the Allowance as a percent of loans decreased during the quarter from 1.10% to 1.09%.\nNon-interest income for the first quarter of 2018 decreased $36,000, or 0.9% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Excluding gains and losses on securities transactions in both periods, the non-interest income increased $75,000, or 2.0%. Non-interest expense increased $730,000, or 8.1%, mainly due to increases in salaries and benefits, equipment, and marketing expenses.\nTotal assets of the company decreased $21.4 million, or 1.6%, compared to December 31, 2017, to $1.33 billion. Capital decreased $15.2 million during the first quarter of 2018 primarily because the payment of the special and regular dividends exceeded the net income. The ratio of equity to assets decreased from 9.85% at the end of 2017 to 8.86% at the end of the first quarter of 2018. The Bank’s Tier 1 Leverage ratio decreased from 10.33% as of December 31, 2017 to 9.51% as of March 31, 2018.\nH. Douglas Chaffin, President and CEO, commented, “We continue to see solid loan growth, and the improvement in net interest margin combined with the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act contributed to the substantial improvement in earnings this quarter. Our new business pipeline remains strong and we expect loan growth to continue the rest of this year, which should lead to further margin improvement. Notably, we also expect credit quality to remain strong, as we see nothing that might inhibit our strong quality metrics in the near term. Our focus on managing our capital has also allowed us to bring more value to our shareholders, through the regular and special dividends paid in the first quarter and the increase in the quarterly dividend we announced today. We will continue to keep our eyes open for the right opportunities to grow through strategic acquisitions, while remaining disciplined in that regard. We remain confident in our ability to maintain our position as the premier independent provider of financial services in the communities we serve.”\nConference Call\nMBT Financial Corp. will hold a conference call to discuss the First Quarter 2018 results on Friday, April 27, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
