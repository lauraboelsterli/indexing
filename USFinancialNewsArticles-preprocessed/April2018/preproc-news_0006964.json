    "text": "LUND, Sweden, April 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Alfa Laval – a world leader in heat transfer, centrifugal separation and fluid handling – has signed an agreement to sell its commercial tubular heat exchanger business, currently part of the Greenhouse division, to the BITZER Group. The closing of the agreement is expected on May 1, 2018.\nThe commercial tubular heat exchanger business with base in Alonte, Italy, and with focus on the refrigeration and air conditioning market, has been a part of Greenhouse since 2016. It was moved there, along with a few other selected product groups, to give it the best possible conditions to improve its performance. The strategy has proven to be successful and the commercial tubular heat exchanger business reported revenues of about SEK 120 million in 2017.\n\"We have seen a positive development of the commercial tubular heat exchanger business last year,\" says Tom Erixon, President and CEO of the Alfa Laval Group. \"However, under the ownership of the BITZER Group we are convinced the business will have even better opportunities to develop.\"\n\"I am delighted to be able to welcome Alfa Laval's shell-and-tube heat exchangers to the BITZER family. The products taken over from Alfa Laval are designed for air-conditioning and refrigeration applications and will thus enlarge BITZER's product portfolio,\" says Gianni Parlanti, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer of the BITZER Group. \"With this operation, BITZER is becoming the largest independent manufacturer in the shell-and-tube heat exchanger market worldwide.\"\nAlfa Laval will continue to sell tubular heat exchangers produced in Bergamo, Italy and Sarasota, USA for niche applications.\nDid you know that… a shell-and-tube heat exchanger can also be called tubular heat exchangers?\nAbout Alfa Laval\nAlfa Laval is a leading global provider of specialized products and engineering solutions based on its key technologies of heat transfer, separation and fluid handling.\nThe company's equipment, systems and services are dedicated to assisting customers in optimizing the performance of their processes.
