    "text": "April 19, 2018 / 1:22 PM / Updated 3 hours ago Black men arrested at Starbucks want change in U.S. racial attitudes Ian Simpson 3 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two black men who were arrested at a Starbucks Corp cafe in Philadelphia while waiting for a friend said on Thursday they hoped the widely publicized incident would lead to changes in U.S. racial attitudes. A man raises his arm in protest outside the Center City Starbucks, where two black men were arrested, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania U.S. April 16, 2018. REUTERS/Mark Makela \nThe men, Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson, said in an interview on ABC’s “Good Morning America” that they wanted to use their arrests a week ago to ensure no one else would undergo a similar experience. \nThe incident is an “opportunity as a stepping stone to really stand up and show your greatness and that you are not judged by the color of your skin,” Nelson said. \n“It’s not just a black people thing, it’s a people thing.” \nOnline footage of the incident, which was filmed by an onlooker, has been viewed almost 11 million times. The arrests sparked protests and a decision by Starbucks to close more than 8,000 stores on May 29 to conduct racial-bias training for employees. \nRobinson said the incident was more about “what’s right is right and what’s wrong is wrong.” \nThe incident put Starbucks, which prides itself on diversity and inclusiveness, at the center of a social media storm after the cafe manager called police on Nelson and Robinson. \nThe men had not made a purchase and were waiting for a friend to discuss a real estate deal. A female manager, who has since been fired, called police within two minutes of the pair’s arrival, according to the men’s account of the incident. They were released without charges. \n“It didn’t really hit me what was going on, that this was real, until I’m being double-locked with my hands behind my back,” Robinson said. \nPolice Commissioner Richard Ross, who came under sharp criticism for the incident and his defense of the officers, apologized to Robinson and Nelson and said he had made the situation worse. \nRoss told a news conference he had been unaware that Starbucks’ policy was to allow people to remain in its cafes without making a purchase. Police will draft a policy to deal with similar situations, he said. \nThe men’s attorney, Stewart Cohen, said on the ABC show that they were engaged in mediation with Starbucks, with a retired federal judge as arbitrator. \nStarbucks also has turned to co-founder and Executive Chairman Howard Schultz to emphasize its commitment to offering a “safe space” to customers.
