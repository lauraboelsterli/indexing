(NYSE: ZAYO) today announced that it has completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Neutral Path Communications and Near North Partners.\nThe acquisition adds 452 owned route miles, plus additional leased route miles, to Zayo’s extensive North American network, including a unique, high-count fiber route from Minneapolis to Omaha.
