    "text": "23 COMMENTS The U.S. Surgeon General on Thursday urged individuals and families at risk of opioid abuse to keep a medication on hand that reverses the effects of an overdose.\nThe medication, naloxone, has become increasingly available at pharmacies without a prescription and is widely carried by police and emergency personnel. The advisory from Surgeon General Jerome Adams —the first surgeon general’s public health advisory in 13 years—reflects growing concern about the scope of an epidemic that saw a 21% increase in opioid overdose deaths from 2015 to 2016, according to data released last month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n“The Surgeon General is now recommending that more individuals, including family, friends and those who are personally at risk for an opioid overdose, also keep the drug on hand,” the advisory said.\nIn an accompanying statement, Dr. Adams added, “It is time to make sure more people have access to this lifesaving medication, because 77% of opioid overdose deaths occur outside of a medical setting and more than half occur at home.”\nRead More\nFDA Wants Better Control of Online Opioid Sales (April 4) Opioid Crisis Gets Washington’s Attention (March 8) Trump Announces Opioid Crisis a Public Health Emergency (Oct. 26, 2017) Graphic: The Victims of the Opioid Crisis (Dec. 29, 2016) The Children of the Opioid Crisis (Dec. 15, 2016) Addiction experts are in wide agreement on the most effective way to help opioid addicts: Medication-assisted treatment. But most inpatient rehab facilities in the U.S. don’t offer this option. WSJ’s Jason Bellini reports on why the medication option is controversial, and in many places, hard to come by. Image: Ryno Eksteen and Thomas Williams Naloxone rapidly reverses an overdose of drugs such as morphine and heroin but must be given quickly to be effective. CVS Health and Walgreens have announced they will stock naloxone in the form of the nasal spray Narcan. The medication also is sold under the name Evzio.\nAn estimated 2.1 million people in the U.S. struggle with an opioid addiction. Opioids are a class of drugs that includes medications commonly prescribed to treat pain—such as oxycodone, hydrocodone and methadone—as well as illegal drugs such as heroin.\nThe sharpest increase in deaths has occurred with illicitly made versions of the pain-reliever fentanyl and its analogues, the surgeon general’s office said. Opioids can kill because they suppress the body’s urge to breathe.\nThe last surgeon general’s advisory, in 2005, warned of the dangers of drinking alcohol during pregnancy.\nThe Trump administration has been seeking to focus renewed attention on the opioid crisis , and Congress allocated $6 billion over two years to combat opioids in its latest budget. Other legislative packages targeting opioids are also moving forward, and the Senate Health Committee released a discussion draft of a bill Wednesday.\nCritics say these actions are far less than needed, and that more funding is necessary for treatment and other initiatives given the scope of the problem.\nThe cost of naloxone, which varies, is covered by most insurance policies. Available as an injection or nasal spray, naloxone blocks or reverses the effects of opioids and is available without a prescription in most states.\nMost states also have laws designed to protect health care professionals who prescribe and dispense naloxone from civil and criminal liabilities, and many also have “good Samaritan” laws to protect people who administer naloxone or call for help during an overdose emergency.\nWrite to Stephanie Armour at stephanie.armour@wsj.com",
