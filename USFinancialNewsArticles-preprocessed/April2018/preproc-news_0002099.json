    "text": "BioCryst Mails Letter to Stockholders Highlighting Compelling Upside Opportunity\nBioCryst Special Meeting of Stockholders Scheduled for May 9, 2018\nRESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:BCRX) (“BioCryst”) today announced that it has filed definitive proxy materials with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in connection with the pending merger of BioCryst and Idera. The definitive proxy statement is available on the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website, as well as www.sec.gov .\nBioCryst’s Special Meeting of Stockholders is scheduled to take place on May 9, 2018 at BioCryst’s corporate offices in Durham, North Carolina at 10:00 AM ET. All BioCryst common stockholders of record as of the close of business on April 4, 2018, will be entitled to vote their shares either in person or by proxy at the stockholder meeting.\nThe BioCryst Board of Directors recommend that all stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal as well as all other BioCryst proposals included in the definitive proxy statement on the proxy card today.\nAdditionally, BioCryst issued an open letter to its stockholders. The full text follows.\nDear BioCryst Stockholder,\nOn January 22, 2018, BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“BioCryst”) announced a merger transaction with Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Idera”) that the BioCryst Board of Directors believes represents a significant opportunity to enhance the value of your investment in BioCryst and is in the best interest of BioCryst stockholders. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of both companies. We are asking for your support of the transaction in advance of the upcoming Special Meeting of BioCryst Stockholders that has been scheduled for May 9, 2018.\nWe recommend that all stockholders vote “FOR” the merger proposal as well as all other BioCryst proposals included in the enclosed definitive proxy statement on the enclosed proxy card today.\nThe merger will bring together two highly complementary companies, BioCryst, a developer of oral therapies for life threatening rare diseases and Idera, a rare-disease focused company pioneering oligonucleotide-based therapeutics, to form a new enterprise to be named “Valenscion” that is focused on the development and commercialization of highly differentiated medicines to serve more patients suffering from rare diseases. Valenscion is expected to be a unique player in rare diseases, with:\nenhanced scale and strengthened competitive position; a robust diversified late-stage pipeline; synergistic discovery engines with enhanced development opportunities; best-in-class people with extensive clinical and commercial know-how in rare diseases; and increased financial strength and flexibility.\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, each share of BioCryst common stock that you own will be exchanged for 0.50 shares of Valenscion common stock, and each share of Idera common stock held by Idera stockholders will be exchanged for 0.20 shares of Valenscion common stock. Upon closing, BioCryst stockholders will own approximately 51.6 percent of the stock of the combined company and Idera stockholders will own approximately 48.4 percent of the combined company, on a fully diluted basis. The receipt of Valenscion common stock in the merger is expected to be tax-free to BioCryst stockholders.\nThe combined company will have the ability to leverage both structure-guided small molecule design and nucleic acid/oligonucleotide chemistry within one organization that may create more effective and potentially unique treatments for rare diseases. Combining both companies’ technologies expands the number of rare disease targets and could create differentiated medicines by combining the technologies to target rare diseases in new and unique ways. We expect the combination of synergistic platforms to bolster our product pipeline and create sustainable value for BioCryst stockholders.\nAdvanced Pipelines Make Now the Right Time for this Transaction\nAdditionally, the combined company will have a diversified and innovative late-stage pipeline with two distinctly different yet highly valuable Phase 3 assets and two promising Phase 2 rare disease assets that are expected to create more opportunities for success. The combined company’s Phase 3 assets have the potential to create a financially strong foundation to support the commercial launch and continued development of the rare disease focused pipeline, building greater and more sustainable value for stockholders, and helping more patients with rare diseases beyond what the two companies could achieve alone.\nIncreased Financial Strength and Flexibility\nThe combined company has a pro forma December 31, 2017 net cash balance of approximately $243 million and expects to realize approximately $20 million in cash synergies in year two and a total of $30 million in annual pre-tax cost synergies in year three after closing. With a strong balance sheet, we believe the combined company will be well-positioned to fund internal clinical development, discovery research and commercial launch preparation efforts. Together, BioCryst and Idera are expected to have opportunities to generate non-dilutive capital, which can be thoughtfully and effectively allocated to maximize the portfolio’s market potential and create stockholder value.\nProven, Veteran Leadership to Guide Pipeline and Deliver on Value Proposition\nThe combined company will have a highly engaged, seasoned Board and management with a successful track record of getting drugs approved and successfully launched. The Board will comprise nine members – four from each of the current BioCryst Board and the Idera Board, and one person to be mutually agreed by the BioCryst Board and the Idera Board who is not to be a director, officer or affiliate of either BioCryst or Idera.\nVincent Milano, CEO of Idera, will lead the combined company and will also serve as a member of the Board. Mr. Milano previously led ViroPharma, a leading developer of innovative therapies for rare diseases, which was sold to Shire Pharmaceuticals in 2014, and has significant experience and success creating drugs for hereditary angioedema. Robert Ingram will serve as Chairman of the Board of the combined company. Mr. Ingram is a general partner at Hatteras Venture Partners and former Chairman and CEO of GlaxoWellcome. His extensive experience in the pharmaceutical industry as both an executive and director and his private investment expertise will contribute valuable insight and expertise. Jon P. Stonehouse, CEO of BioCryst, will serve as a member of the Board of Directors. Mr. Stonehouse has financial transaction, business development and management expertise from his current role as well as his previous role at Merck KGaA.\nBioCryst Conducted a Robust Strategic Evaluation\nBioCryst has a well-advised Board comprised of highly experienced directors with extensive industry knowledge. The Board retained leading financial and legal advisors to assist in evaluating strategic options. The BioCryst Board met numerous times over a two-year period to discuss value-enhancing opportunities, including mergers, bolt-on acquisitions and in-licensing transactions. Following the Board’s review of these strategic opportunities and BioCryst’s discussions with numerous potential partners, the Board believes the merger with Idera makes strategic and financial sense and is a unique opportunity to enhance stockholder value.\nVote “FOR” the Merger Proposal TODAY\nYour Board of Directors believes that the merger is value-enhancing for BioCryst stockholders, and we recommend that stockholders vote today “FOR” the BioCryst proposals set forth in this proxy statement, including “FOR” the merger proposal.\nYour vote is extremely important, no matter how many shares you own. Please take a moment to vote “FOR” the proposals set forth on the proxy card today – by internet, telephone toll-free or by signing, dating and returning the enclosed proxy card in the postage-paid envelope provided.\nIf you have any questions or need assistance voting your shares, please contact Innisfree M&A, our proxy solicitor, by calling toll-free at (888) 750-5834 (from the U.S. and Canada) and (412) 232-3651 (from other locations) or collect at (212) 750-5833.\nOn behalf of your Board of Directors, thank you for your continued support of BioCryst.\nSincerely,\nThe BioCryst Board of Directors\nAbout BioCryst Pharmaceuticals\nBioCryst Pharmaceuticals designs, optimizes and develops novel small-molecule medicines that address both common and rare conditions.

These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties, and important factors that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from Idera’s or BioCryst’s plans, estimates or expectations.
