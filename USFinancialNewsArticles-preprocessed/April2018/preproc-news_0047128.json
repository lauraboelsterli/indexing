FILE PHOTO: The Ford logo is seen at the New York Auto Show in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., March 29, 2018. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton \nAsia Pacific President Peter Fleet, speaking at an auto show in Beijing, also said the U.S. carmaker did not expect the rule changes to otherwise significantly impact its strategy in China, the world’s largest auto market. \nChina said this month it would scrap a limit on foreign ownership of all automotive ventures by 2022 in a major policy shift to open up the market, with limits on new-energy vehicle (NEV) ventures to be removed this year.
