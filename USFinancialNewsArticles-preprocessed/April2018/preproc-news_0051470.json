Mr. Fred joins Bluerock during a period of significant growth in sales as well as selling group expansion and increasing product acceptance.\nIn his new role, Mr. Fred will serve as lead due diligence contact for Bluerock's selling group and for the growing cohort of entities performing due diligence on Bluerock's product suite as a solution for their platforms. He will play a key role in Bluerock's ongoing industry and product-level education forums, working closely with independent broker dealers, regional member firms, wirehouses, financial advisors, and registered investment advisors.\n\"David joins Bluerock with an understanding of the vital need for substantive connectivity between the sponsor and broker dealers and RIAs. He's highly respected throughout the industry for his in-depth approach to research, due diligence and partnership focus.

The timing of David's appointment could not be better as we expand into additional distribution channels and investment structures,\" Mr. Schwaber said.\nAbout Bluerock\nBluerock is a leading alternative investment and asset management firm with over $4.5 billion on Assets Under Management and headquartered in Manhattan with regional offices across the U.S. Bluerock principals have a collective 115+ years of investing experience, have been involved with over $10 billion in investments, and have helped launch leading private and public company platforms.\nBluerock website: www.bluerockre.com\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/david-fred-joins-bluerock-as-senior-vice-president-of-due-diligence-300636906.html\nSOURCE Bluerock",
