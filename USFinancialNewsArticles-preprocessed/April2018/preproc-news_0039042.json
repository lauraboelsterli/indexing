    "text": "Published: Apr 19, 2018 4:53 p.m. ET Share \nProsecutor say 2016 death accidental, no evidence to charge anyone Getty Prince’s death coincided with the national opioid epidemic, which has often involved fentanyl. \nBy Kris Maher \nNo criminal charges will be filed in the investigation into the 2016 death of Prince from an accidental fentanyl overdose, a Minnesota prosecutor said Thursday. \nThere is insufficient evidence to show how the musician received counterfeit Vicodin pills containing fentanyl, Carver County Attorney Mark Metz said. The county sheriff’s office has been investigating since the singer was found unresponsive at his Paisley Park mansion outside Minneapolis on April 21, 2016. \n“We have no direct evidence that a specific person provided the fentanyl to Prince,” Metz said at a news conference. “The bottom line is that we simply do not have sufficient evidence to charge anyone with a crime related to Prince’s death.” \nKey details surrounding Prince’s death at age 57 remain a mystery. According to Metz, investigators didn’t identify any suspects or evidence to suggest anyone had a motive to harm Prince. Metz said that in all likelihood Prince was unaware that he was taking counterfeit pills. He said Prince had no prescriptions for Vicodin, a pain medication, and that there was no evidence that a doctor provided the pills.",
