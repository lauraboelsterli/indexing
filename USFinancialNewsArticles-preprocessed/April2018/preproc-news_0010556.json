    "text": "TOKYO (Reuters) - The Japan Sumo Association apologized on Thursday after female medics were asked to leave a sumo ring where they were treating a local official who had collapsed.\nA photo grab from a Youtube video shows women climbing up a sumo ring to treat Maizuru city mayor Ryozo Tatami, who collapsed while making a speech in a gym in Maizuru, Kyoto prefecture, Japan April 4, 2018 in this photo released by Kyodo. Mandatory credit Kyodo/via REUTERS Kyodo news agency reported that Maizuru city mayor Ryozo Tatami collapsed while making a speech in a gym near Kyoto on Wednesday and after several women rushed to help the prone official a referee repeatedly asked them to leave the dohyo.\nTradition forbids women from entering the ring on the grounds that it is sacred and their presence, considered “unclean”, would pollute it.\nTatami was eventually taken to a nearby hospital and his life was not in danger, according to city officials.\nThe sumo association’s newly elected chairman Hakkaku apologized for the incident and thanked the women.\nFILE PHOTO: Japan Sumo Association chairman Hakkaku (front) and sumo stable masters wearing traditional formal costumes leave after the New Year's ring-entering rite, which was performed by sumo champions, at the annual celebration for the New Year at Meiji Shrine in Tokyo, Japan January 9, 2018. REUTERS/Toru Hanai “It was an inappropriate response in the life-threatening situation. I deeply apologize,” Hakkaku said in a statement.\nThe incident comes at a difficult time for sumo in Japan. The ancient sport has been plagued by a series of scandals in recent months.\nHakkaku is attempting to rebuild his sport’s tarnished reputation, after former yokozuna – the highest ranking in the sport – Harumafuji retired in December after assaulting a junior wrestler.\nIn February, Japanese police said they had referred a sumo wrestler to prosecutors on suspicion of indecent assault and last month Egyptian wrestler Osunaarashi was asked to retire after being involved in a car accident while driving without a license.\nReporting by Jack Tarrant; Editing by Peter Rutherford\n ",
