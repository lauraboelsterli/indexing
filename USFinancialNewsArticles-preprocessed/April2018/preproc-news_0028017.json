    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., April 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AutoWeb, Inc. (Nasdaq:AUTO), a pioneer and leading provider of digital automotive services connecting in-market car buyers with dealers and OEMs, has appointed Jared Rowe as director, president and chief executive officer, succeeding Jeffrey Coats effective April 12, 2018.\nRowe brings more than two decades of key management experience across the automotive and marketing industries, holding senior positions at FordDirect, Cox Automotive, and Cerberus-backed YP Holdings. As president of YP Holdings, Jared was instrumental in the improvement of YellowPages.com ’s business operations and its eventual sale to Dex Media in 2017. While at Cox Automotive, Rowe served as president of the Media Solutions Group, where he was responsible for leading the Autotrader, Kelley Blue Book, Dealer.com and Haystack businesses.\nAutoWeb Chairman, Michael Fuchs, commented: “Jared has a strong track record of successfully implementing strategic plans to revitalize automotive businesses competing in the e-commerce industry. His leadership and restructuring at YP Holdings and Cox Automotive led to material operating improvements and enhanced competitive positioning. Jared will be an invaluable addition to our company as he shares our vision of delivering the highest quality marketing products to dealers and OEMs.\n“I would like to thank Jeff Coats for his many years of service and dedication to AutoWeb. He has been an exceptional CEO for more than a decade and a valued board member since 1996. We look forward to continuing to work with Jeff as he assists Jared during a transition period as a consultant. We wish him the best in his future endeavors.”\nThis will be Rowe’s second stint with AutoWeb, as he previously served as manager of strategic business development in 1998.\nRowe commented on his appointment: “It’s been nearly 20 years since I kicked off my digital marketing career at the former Autobytel. I am excited to rejoin AutoWeb to lead the continued evolution of this digital marketing platform that specializes in providing OEMs and dealers with high-quality, performance managed campaigns. It is important to provide our clients with detailed attribution that enables them to understand the value and ROI our services and products provide.\n“We have a solid foundation to build from with an established brand, advanced technology, an extremely talented team and clients that value the quality of our products. I look forward to leveraging my experiences to help return AutoWeb to growth by introducing new strategies and initiatives that I believe will unlock the company’s full potential and maximize shareholder value.”\nRowe holds a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Michigan, as well as a dual Bachelor of Business Administration degree in Business Management and Automotive Marketing from Northwood University.\nAbout AutoWeb, Inc.\nAutoWeb, Inc. provides high-quality consumer leads, clicks and associated marketing services to automotive dealers and manufacturers throughout the United States. The company also provides consumers with robust and original online automotive content to help them make informed car-buying decisions. The company pioneered the automotive Internet in 1995 and has since helped tens of millions of automotive consumers research vehicles; connected thousands of dealers nationwide with motivated car buyers; and has helped every major automaker market its brand online.\nInvestors and other interested parties can receive AutoWeb news alerts and special event invitations by accessing the online registration form at investor.autoweb.com/alerts.cfm .\nInducement Options\nAs an inducement for joining the company, Rowe was granted options to acquire 1,000,000 shares of the company’s common stock at an exercise price equal to $3.26 per share, which was the closing price of the common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market on the April 12, 2018 grant date. The options have a term of seven years and will vest monthly in thirty-six (36) monthly installments on the first day of each calendar month following the grant date. Vesting of the options will accelerate upon the occurrence of certain events, including a termination of Rowe’s employment by the company without cause or upon a change in control of the company.\nForward-Looking Statements Disclaimer\nThe statements contained in this press release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements under the federal securities laws.
