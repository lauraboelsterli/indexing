CVB Financial Corp. and Community Bank entered into a merger agreement in the first quarter of 2018.\nONTARIO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CVB Financial Corp. (NASDAQ:CVBF) and its subsidiary, Citizens Business Bank (“the Company”), announced record earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nCVB Financial Corp. reported net income of $34.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared with $17.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $28.5 million for the first quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per share were $0.32 for the first quarter, compared to $0.16 for the prior quarter and $0.26 for the same period last year. Income tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 included a one-time charge of $13.2 million due to the re-measurement of the Company’s net deferred tax asset (“DTA”) resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Reform Act”). Excluding the impact of the $13.2 million DTA revaluation, net income totaled $31.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, or $0.28 per share. Net earnings grew by $3.9 million over the prior quarter, or 12.41%, when the impact of the DTA revaluation is excluded, and $6.4 million from the first quarter of 2017, or 22.48%.\nOn February 26, 2018, we announced that we entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization and merger (the “Agreement”), pursuant to which Community Bank will merge with and into Citizens Business Bank in a stock and cash transaction valued at approximately $885.2 million, based on CVBF’s closing stock price of $23.60 on February 26, 2018. The merger will increase Citizens’ total assets to approximately $12.4 billion on a pro forma basis as of December 31, 2017.\nChris Myers, President and CEO of Citizens Business Bank, commented, “I am pleased with our bank’s continued focus on growing both earnings and assets. Our executives are doing an outstanding job balancing the ongoing demands of running Citizens Business Bank and preparing for the merger with Community Bank.”\nNet income of $34.9 million for the first quarter of 2018 produced an annualized return on beginning equity of 13.24%, an annualized return on average equity (“ROAE”) of 13.02%, and an annualized return on average assets (“ROAA”) of 1.71%. Excluding the impact of the $13.2 million DTA revaluation resulting from the Tax Reform Act, ROAE and ROAA for the fourth quarter of 2017 were 11.28% and 1.48%, respectively. Net income for the first quarter of 2017 produced an annualized return on average equity of 11.39% and an annualized return on average assets of 1.42%. The efficiency ratio for the first quarter of 2018 was 43.08%, compared to 41.81% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 46.01% for the first quarter of 2017.\nNet interest income before recapture of loan loss provision was $70.5 million for the quarter, which was a $754,000, or 1.06%, decrease from the fourth quarter of 2017, and a $5.1 million, or 7.78%, increase over the first quarter of 2017. Total interest income and fees on loans for the first quarter of 2018 of $55.2 million decreased $677,000, or 1.21%, from the fourth quarter of 2017, but increased $6.6 million, or 13.48%, from the first quarter of 2017. Total investment income of $16.6 million decreased $259,000, or 1.53%, from the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1.5 million, or 8.34%, from the first quarter of 2017. Interest expense increased $132,000, or 6.46%, from the fourth quarter of 2017 and $161,000, or 7.99%, in comparison with the first quarter of 2017.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, $1.0 million of loan loss provision was recaptured, compared to $1.5 million recaptured for the prior quarter, and $4.5 million recaptured for the same period last year.\nNoninterest income was $12.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $12.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, and $8.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. The $334,000 quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily the result of a $3.5 million net gain on the sale of our last remaining OREO. The first quarter of 2018 also included a $475,000 recovery of a Valley Business Bank (“VBB”) loan that was fully charged off prior to acquisition and $436,000 in a death benefit included in our BOLI policies. The fourth quarter of 2017 included a $2.9 million net gain due to an eminent domain condemnation of one of our banking center buildings and a $906,000 net gain on sale of a branch acquired from VBB.\nNoninterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $35.9 million, compared to $35.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, and $34.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. The $889,000 quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily the result of a $728,000 increase in acquisition expense in connection with the proposed merger of Community Bank. The $1.8 million increase over the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to a $739,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $508,000 increase in occupancy and equipment costs, and an increase of $271,000 in legal expense. As a percentage of average assets, noninterest expense was 1.77%, compared to 1.67% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 1.70% for the first quarter of 2017.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income, before provision for loan losses, was $70.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $71.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $65.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. Our net interest margin (tax equivalent) was 3.68% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 3.68% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 3.51% for the first quarter of 2017. On a nominal basis, excluding the impact from tax-exempt interest, the net interest margin for the first quarter of 2018 grew by three basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and by 20 basis points over the first quarter of 2017. Total average earning asset yields (tax equivalent) were 3.80% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 3.79% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 3.62% for the first quarter of 2017. Total cost of funds continued to be stable as reflected by a 0.12% cost of funds for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 0.11% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 0.12% for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in the net interest margin over the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to a 17 basis point increase in loan yields as well as the change in the mix of earning assets. Average loans increased by $410.8 million and represented 61.5% of earning assets for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 57.2% for the first quarter of 2017. The tax equivalent yield on investments decreased five basis points over the first quarter of 2017, due to a reduction of the federal tax rate on tax-exempt investments resulting from the Tax Reform Act, from 35% for the first quarter of 2017 to 21% for the first quarter of 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was 28%, compared with 36% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Reform Act was enacted into law. Beginning in 2018, the Tax Reform Act reduces the federal tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21% and changes or limits certain tax deductions. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a $13.2 million one-time charge to income tax expense due to the tax rate reduction and re-measurement of its net deferred tax assets. Our estimated annual effective tax rate varies depending upon the level of tax-advantaged income as well as available tax credits.\nAssets\nThe Company reported total assets of $8.36 billion at March 31, 2018. This represented an increase of $85.6 million, or 1.03%, from total assets of $8.27 billion at December 31, 2017. Interest-earning assets of $7.92 billion at March 31, 2018 increased $115.5 million, or 1.48%, when compared with $7.80 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase in interest-earning assets was primarily due to a $330.0 million increase in interest-earning balances due from the Federal Reserve. This increase was partially offset by a $171.0 million decrease in investment securities and a $35.6 million decrease in total loans. The decrease in total loans was due to the approximate $71.7 million decline in seasonal borrowings of dairy & livestock and agribusiness loans.\nTotal assets of $8.36 billion at March 31, 2018 decreased $203.0 million, or 2.37%, from total assets of $8.56 billion at March 31, 2017. Interest-earning assets totaled $7.92 billion at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $168.7 million, or 2.09%, when compared with earning assets of $8.09 billion at March 31, 2017. The decrease in interest-earning assets was due to a $416.9 million decrease in investment securities, which was partially offset by a $179.5 million increase in total loans and a $90.9 million increase in interest-earning balances due from the Federal Reserve.\nInvestment Securities\nTotal investment securities were $2.74 billion at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $171.0 million, or 5.87%, from $2.91 billion at December 31, 2017 and a decrease of $416.9 million, or 13.21%, from $3.16 billion at March 31, 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, investment securities held-to-maturity (“HTM”) totaled $798.3 million, a $31.6 million decrease, or 3.81%, from December 31, 2017 and a $86.8 million decrease, or 9.80%, from March 31, 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, investment securities available-for-sale (“AFS”) totaled $1.94 billion, inclusive of a pre-tax net unrealized loss of $28.5 million due to a decline in fair value resulting from higher interest rates. AFS securities declined by $139.4 million, or 6.70%, from December 31, 2017, and declined by $330.1 million, or 14.53%, from March 31, 2017.\nThe decrease in investment securities from the fourth quarter of 2017 was due to principal payments from the portfolio and minimal reinvestment activity during the first quarter of 2018.\nCombined, the AFS and HTM investments in mortgage backed securities (“MBS”) and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) totaled $2.28 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $2.43 billion at December 31, 2017 and $2.61 billion at March 31, 2017. Virtually all of our MBS and CMOs are issued or guaranteed by government or government sponsored enterprises, which have the implied guarantee of the U.S. Government.\nOur combined AFS and HTM municipal securities totaled $306.3 million as of March 31, 2018. These securities are located in 29 states. Our largest concentrations of holdings are located in Minnesota at 21.24%, Massachusetts at 10.50%, Texas at 9.56%, and Connecticut at 5.73%.\nLoans\nTotal loans and leases, net of deferred fees and discounts, of $4.79 billion at March 31, 2018 decreased by $35.6 million, or 0.74%, from December 31, 2017. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in loans was due to a decline of $71.7 million in dairy & livestock and agribusiness loans primarily due to seasonal paydowns. The overall decrease was partially offset by growth of $31.3 million in commercial real estate loans.\nTotal loans and leases, net of deferred fees and discounts, of $4.79 billion at March 31, 2018 increased by $179.5 million, or 3.89%, from March 31, 2017. The increase in total loans was principally due to growth of $163.9 million in commercial real estate loans, $31.7 million in dairy & livestock and agribusiness loans, and $10.5 million in Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans. This growth was partially offset by decreases of $17.1 million in consumer and other loans and $15.7 million in commercial and industrial loans.\nDeposits & Customer Repurchase Agreements\nDeposits of $6.71 billion and customer repurchase agreements of $487.3 million totaled $7.20 billion at March 31, 2018. This represents an increase of $96.1 million, or 1.35%, when compared with total deposits and customer repurchase agreements of $7.10 billion at December 31, 2017. Deposits and customer repurchase agreements decreased by $210.5 million, or 2.84%, when compared with total deposits and customer repurchase agreements of $7.41 billion at March 31, 2017.\nNoninterest-bearing deposits were $4.06 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $216.3 million, or 5.62%, when compared to December 31, 2017, and an increase of $63.6 million, or 1.59%, when compared to $4.00 billion at March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, noninterest-bearing deposits were 60.55% of total deposits, compared to 58.75% at December 31, 2017 and 58.44% at March 31, 2017.\nOur average cost of total deposits was 0.09% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, unchanged from both the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2017. Our cost of total deposits including customer repurchase agreements was 0.11% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to 0.10% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 0.11% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nFHLB Advance, Other Borrowings and Debentures\nWe had no short-term borrowings at March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, we had $25.8 million of junior subordinated debentures, unchanged from December 31, 2017. These debentures bear interest at three-month LIBOR plus 1.38% and mature in 2036.\nAsset Quality\nThe allowance for loan losses totaled $59.9 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $59.6 million at December 31, 2017 and $59.2 million at March 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses for the first quarter of 2018 was increased by net recoveries on loans of $1.3 million and was reduced by a $1.0 million loan loss provision recapture. The allowance for loan losses was 1.25%, 1.23%, and 1.28% of total loans and leases outstanding, at March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2017, respectively.\nNonperforming loans, defined as nonaccrual loans plus nonperforming TDR loans, were $10.2 million at March 31 2018, or 0.21% of total loans. This compares to nonperforming loans of $10.7 million, or 0.22%, of total loans, at December 31, 2017, and $10.3 million, or 0.22%, of total loans, at March 31, 2017. The $10.2 million in nonperforming loans at March 31, 2018 are summarized as follows: $6.7 million in commercial real estate loans, $1.3 million in single-family residential (“SFR”) mortgage loans, $818,000 in dairy & livestock and agribusiness loans, $589,000 in SBA loans, $438,000 in consumer and other loans, and $272,000 in commercial and industrial loans. The $544,000 decrease in nonperforming loans quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to a $317,000 decrease in nonperforming SBA loans, a $114,000 decrease in nonperforming consumer and other loans, and a $96,000 decrease in nonperforming commercial real estate loans.\nAs of March 31, 2018, we had no OREO, compared to one property with a carrying value of $4.5 million at December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, we sold our last remaining property, realizing a net gain on sale of $3.5 million.

As a percentage of total loans, delinquencies, excluding nonaccruals, were 0.02% at March 31, 2018, 0.02% at December 31, 2017, and 0.03% at March 31, 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018 we had $4.3 million in performing TDR loans, compared to $4.8 million in performing TDR loans at December 31, 2017, and $19.7 million in performing TDR loans at March 31, 2017. In terms of the number of loans, we had 15 performing TDR loans at March 31, 2018, compared to 16 performing TDR loans at December 31, 2017, and 25 performing TDR loans at March 31, 2017.\nNonperforming assets, defined as nonaccrual loans plus OREO, totaled $10.2 million at March 31, 2018, $15.2 million at December 31, 2017, and $14.9 million at March 31, 2017.
