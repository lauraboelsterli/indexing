    "text": "Conor McGregor turned himself in to New York police hours after he and others attacked a bus filled with UFC 223 fighters at Barclays Center in Brooklyn on Thursday, a police spokesman told USA TODAY Sports.\nMcGregor, who was labeled a person of interest earlier in the day, has not immediately been charged with any crimes and New York police spokesperson George Tsourovakas said the investigation is ongoing.\nMcGregor, UFC's lightweight champ and the sport's biggest star, was seen on video hurling objects at a bus that was leaving the arena for an area hotel at the conclusion of UFC 223's media day. Police said McGregor and about 10 others \"became irate and began throwing various items, damaging property.\"\nMore from USA Today:\nWarriors show 'pathetic effort' as Pacers pass 'big test'\nJordan Spieth shoots 66 to lead Masters opening round by two shots\nTiger Woods shoots unspectacular 73 at Masters, but it's still a success \nFighters Michael Chiesa (facial injuries) and Ray Borg (eye injury) were forced from their bouts at UFC 223 as result of the attack. UFC President Dana White also threw Artem Lobov off the card because of his involvement in the incident with McGregor.\n\"This is the most disgusting thing that has happened in the history of the company,\" White said.\nMike Bohn tweet \n\"The organization deems today's disruption completely unacceptable and is currently working on the consequences that will follow,\" the UFC said in a statement. \"... Individuals involved in the incident are not welcome at tomorrow's ceremonial weigh-in or Saturday's event at Barclays Center.\"\nRick Little, Chiesa's coach, told MMAjunkie that Chiesa was \"cut up\" from shattered glass.\n\"Conor went bananas and put a beating on the van that we were in looking for Khabib (Nurmagomedov),\" said Little, who was on the bus. \"A million security guards had to restrain him. Mike's cut up now. He's got marks on him, for sure.\"\n\"A decision was made by the New York State Athletic Commission to pull me from UFC 223,\" Chiesa said on Twitter. \"I'm devastated to say the least. @Showtimepettis I hope to run this match up ASAP, June 9th in your backyard. That's all I have to say for now. Much love.\"\nMichael Chiesa tweet",
