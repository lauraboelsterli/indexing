    "text": "Milwaukee designated hitter Ryan Braun had three hits and beat out an infield single to key a four-run fourth inning as the Brewers ran their winning streak to eight games with a 6-2 victory over the Kansas City Royals at Kauffman Stadium on Wednesday.\nBraun produced Milwaukee’s first hit off Royals right-hander Jason Hammel (0-2) in the fourth inning and Jesus Aguilar had two RBIs as the Brewers (16-9) swept the two-game interleague series.\nMike Moustakas hit his seventh homer and Salvador Perez had an RBI groundout in his second game back from a knee injury for Kansas City (5-17), which dropped to 1-9 at home.\nMilwaukee right-hander Jhoulys Chacin (2-1) gave up four hits and two runs in 5 2/3 innings and retired the first 11 he faced for his second straight victory. He struck out three and walked one while using only 64 pitches.\nHammel gave up five hits and four runs (three earned) in 6 2/3 innings. He struck out one and walked two.\nHammel was 10-2 with a 3.13 ERA in his career against the Brewers entering the game.\nChristian Yelich walked with one out in the first inning, the only base runner for either team before Yelich walked again to kick-start the Brewers’ fourth. Braun reached on an infield single and Shaw doubled in the first run of the inning.\nDanny Santana hit a fly to right field that Jorge Soler could not handle for an error and Braun scored on what was ruled as a sacrifice fly for a 2-0 lead. Shaw took third and Santana reached first. Aguilar hit a sacrifice fly, and after Manny Pina reached on an infield single Santana scored on Jonathan Villar’s groundout to make it 4-0.\nMoustakas’ homer in the fourth was the first runner off Chacin. Jon Jay and Whit Merrifield singled to open the sixth inning, and Jay scored on Perez’s one-out groundout to cut the Royals’ deficit to 4-2.\nBraun doubled and scored on Aguilar’s single in a two-run eighth, and the other run scored on an infield error. Aguilar is 13-for-27 with six RBIs in his seven starts\n—Field Level Media\n ",
