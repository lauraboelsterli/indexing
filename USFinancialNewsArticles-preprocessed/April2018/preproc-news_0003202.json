    "text": "DUBAI, UAE, April 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nArgentum 47, Inc. ( www.arg47.com ), formerly known as Global Equity International, Inc. , (OTC Pink: ARGQ) and its fully-owned foreign subsidiaries, a specialist in both Retail and Corporate Financial Services, Corporate Consultancy and Human Resources, with offices located in Dubai and the United Kingdom, is proud to announce that its plans to completely rebrand the Company are now in full effect. This rebranding comes as a result of management’s plans to completely change the Company’s direction by way of inorganic growth via significant acquisitions around the globe.\nOn March 29, 2018, the Company changed its name, from Global Equity International, Inc. to Argentum 47, Inc., in order to better fit the Company´s new and improved business model. In tandem and effective April 2, 2018, the Company also changed its OTC trading symbol from GEQU to ARGQ.\nThe newly rebranded Company, Argentum 47, Inc., will have three core divisions with the Parent Company holding all of the divisions as fully owned subsidiaries. Each division allows for incredible cross-selling opportunities and each combined give the Company an extremely strong backbone with multiple and independent income streams.\nThe three core divisions are:\nArgentum 47 Consultants (GEP Equity Holdings Limited) – www.arg47consulting.com\nOur traditional Corporate Finance and Capital Market business, run out of Dubai and the United Kingdom, has been operating in this space for many years and is experiencing stronger and much more stable future growth. With better strategic relationships and our own ability to assist with funding of prospective clients, the forecasts for this division are based on a more solid footing with an extremely attractive pipeline and client list. GEP Equity Holdings Limited will soon formally change its name to Argentum 47 Consulting Limited. This end of the business has had a focus on American capital markets, we are now making allegiances with more British Bankers and Finance Houses to be able to offer an effective client solution both sides of the Altantic.\nArgentum 47 Financial Management Limited – www.arg47financialmanagement.com\nArgentum 47 Financial Management will act as a parent company for the acquisition of the financial advisory firms with funds under management that will be acquired both in the United Kingdom and South East Asia. The Company will manage the organic growth of each entity acquired and support the back office and accounting operations. Each new acquisition will be a fully owned subsidiary of Argentum 47 Financial Management Limited.\nThe acquisition of the initial four advisory firms, managing an aggregate of US$150 million, is now underway. The Company´s pipeline of further target acquisitions is continually growing and the analysis of those companies to find the most suited targets, with a healthy margin to grow in mature markets, is being performed by Management on a daily basis.\nKingsman James (GE Professionals DMCC) – www.kingsmanjames.com\nOur HR and Head Hunting Division has shown reasonable growth in the first two years of its life. This year, we are expecting further growth with their own client list however, 2018 will see a change in the prospects for Kingsman James.\nBeing in the HR and Head Hunting business, this division is perfectly placed to assist in the organic growth of our Financial Management (Advisory) division. Our target acquisitions are companies that have expensive clients in their book of business but invariably not enough advisors to service those clients effectively. Kingsman James will be putting a very lucrative offer to the market to recruit senior financial advisors to help grow the companies acquired by both new business and farming the existing clients already under contract. A perfect partner for the Financial Management division. GE Professionals DMCC will soon formally change its name to Argentum 47 HR DMCC.\nPeter Smith, CEO of Argentum 47 Inc., said : “We have spent almost a decade building this business through mass economic turmoil and global changes. We have seen the banks tighten controls beyond belief in the earlier part of the 2010’s, historically low interest rates spurring on high growth in blue chip capital markets, political changes in America and a UK breakaway from Europe in Brexit. All major events that have in some way affected how we have built our business and forced certain changes to be adopted. As we progress now into 2018, we have become a self-sufficient entity ring fencing ourselves to a large degree to external factors that can have an adverse effect on our bottom line. The acquisition program we started mid-2016 is now working, our capital markets business is bringing better quality clients and our recruitment division is able to better internally supplement both divisions. In the coming year, we will experience metamorphosis of the business and the rebranding of our Company is just part of that, with the significant opportunities that lay ahead in the near future.”\nAbout Argentum 47, Inc. and Subsidiaries.\nArgentum 47, Inc.
