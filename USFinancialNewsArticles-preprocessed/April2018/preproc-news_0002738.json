    "text": "LAVAL, Québec, April 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Acasti Pharma Inc. (“Acasti” or the “Corporation”) (NASDAQ:ACST) (TSX-V:ACST) announces that in accordance with the terms of its outstanding convertible debentures in the total aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000 issued on February 21, 2017 (the “Debentures”), the Corporation has elected to issue an aggregate of 30,348 common shares to the holders of the Debentures in satisfaction of an aggregate of $39,452.40 of interest payable to the holders of the Debentures, which was earned from January 1, 2018 through and payable as of March 31, 2018 (the “Interest Payment”). The common shares issuable for the Interest Payment are issuable at a price of $1.30 per share, being the last closing price of the common shares on the TSX Venture Exchange before March 31, 2018. The settlement of the interest amount in common shares is subject to the Corporation receiving all necessary prior approvals from the TSX Venture Exchange. All amounts referenced are in Canadian dollars.\nAbout Acasti Pharma\nAcasti Pharma is a biopharmaceutical innovator advancing a potentially best-in-class cardiovascular drug, CaPre® (omega-3 phospholipid), for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia, a chronic condition affecting an estimated one third of the U.S. population. Since its founding in 2008, Acasti Pharma has focused on addressing a critical market need for an effective, safe and well-absorbing omega-3 therapeutic that can make a positive impact on the major blood lipids associated with cardiovascular disease risk. CaPre is being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical program in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia, a market that includes 3 to 4 million patients in the U.S. and may expand significantly if omega-3s demonstrate long-term cardiovascular benefits in on-going outcomes studies. Acasti’s strategy is to commercialize CaPre in the U.S. and the company is pursuing partnerships to market CaPre in major countries around the world.
