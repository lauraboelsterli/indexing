    "text": "April 16, 2018 / 4:32 AM / Updated an hour ago Guatemala votes to ask UN court to resolve Belize border spat Sofia Menchu 2 Min Read \nGUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemalans on Sunday voted to ask the top United Nations court to resolve its claim that it owns half the territory of its neighbour Belize, a dispute that dates back to Spanish and British colonial rule of the region. \nWith more than 90 percent of votes counted on Sunday evening, the overwhelming majority voted to ask the International Court of Justice (ICJ), based in The Hague, to intervene. \nGuatemala recognised the independence of Belize at the beginning of the 1990s, but it never accepted the borders and continues to stake a claim to about 11,000 square kilometres, half the territory of the former British colony. \nIn December 2008, both countries signed a deal that its inhabitants could vote to decide whether the territorial claim, which includes various islands, should be decided by the ICJ. \nEnglish-speaking Belize, which became independent in 1981, still hasnâ€™t set a date for its referendum. \nThe border conflict between the two countries dates back to the 18th century.
