    "text": "Strong Earnings and Enhanced Balance Sheet Strength Excellent Property Performance with Growth Across All Segments Enters Into Mutually Beneficial Agreements with Brookdale Senior Living Updates and Improves 2018 Guidance\nCHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR) today announced its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018:\nIncome from continuing operations per diluted common share was $0.22 compared to $0.44 in the same period in 2017. The decline from the first quarter 2017 is mainly due to: the recognition of a $36 million, or $0.10 per share, impairment to an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture consisting principally of skilled nursing facilities that the Company expects to sell in 2018 at a 9 percent capitalization rate on cash rent; and higher deal costs related to the Company’s previously announced transition of a seniors housing portfolio to a newly-formed operator in January 2018. Normalized Funds From Operations (“FFO”) per diluted common share grew two percent to $1.05 compared to the same period in 2017. The increase from the first quarter 2017 is principally due to property portfolio growth and accretive investments, partially offset by the cumulative impact of dispositions and receipt of final repayments on loans receivable and related debt reduction. Reported FFO per diluted common share, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT FFO”), was $0.96 compared to $1.03 in the same period in 2017, driven principally by the higher deal costs previously described.\n“We are pleased to report a strong start to 2018, with excellent property performance, growth across all segments, and enhanced balance sheet strength,” said Debra A. Cafaro, Ventas Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “We executed on our strategic priorities, including extending and combining our leases for our Brookdale portfolio through 2025, successfully transitioning over 70 private pay seniors housing properties to Eclipse Senior Living, a newly-established, high-quality seniors housing operator, and further building out our best-in-class team. As a result of the strength of our business and these successes, we are raising our full year normalized FFO expectations.”\nMutually Beneficial Agreements with Brookdale Senior Living\nVentas has entered into mutually beneficial agreements (collectively, the “Agreement”) with Brookdale Senior Living (NYSE: BKD) (“Brookdale”). The Agreement combines and extends the Company’s leases with Brookdale, providing support for Brookdale’s operational improvement strategy under its new leadership team and bridging Brookdale’s lease term to take advantage of the coming demand wave of a growing seniors population. Currently, Ventas’s 128 wholly-owned seniors housing communities operated by Brookdale under triple-net leases with the Company (the “Brookdale Portfolio”) generate approximately $180 million in annual cash rent and represent 8 percent of the Company’s annual net operating income (“NOI”). Under the Agreement:\nThe Brookdale Portfolio has been substantially combined into a single master lease (the “Master Lease”) with an initial term through December 31, 2025. Brookdale retains two 10-year extension options. Prior to the Agreement, Ventas had nearly $170 million of its $180 million in Brookdale cash rent expiring by 2020. The new Agreement effectively eliminates near-term expirations by extending maturities through 2025. Ventas will provide Brookdale with a cash rent credit averaging $6 million per year commencing May 1, 2018. The Master Lease contains annual rent escalators equal to the lesser of 2.25 percent or four times CPI, commencing January 1, 2019. The transactions will increase Ventas’s 2018 normalized FFO per share modestly, as cash rent should now approximate rent recognized under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Prior to the Agreement, cash rent exceeded rent recognized under GAAP. The Company will record a non-cash expense of $22 million in connection with the Brookdale Agreement. The Master Lease remains guaranteed by Brookdale Senior Living, Inc., and includes enhanced credit and structural protections for Ventas. The Agreement also includes a streamlined, objective change of control (“COC”) standard for Brookdale. If a COC occurs, Ventas’s credit protections are automatically further strengthened and Ventas will receive certain additional rights, fees and protections. To optimize and further improve the portfolio, Brookdale and Ventas intend to actively pursue the sale of certain Brookdale Portfolio properties totaling up to $30 million in cash rent (the “Sale Assets”). If Ventas sells any or all of the Sale Assets, it will receive all of the net sale proceeds and Brookdale will receive a 6.25 percent rent credit (cash rent reduction) thereon. In addition, under the Agreement, Ventas has the right to transition assets in the Brookdale Portfolio to other operators under certain conditions. Brookdale has committed to certain annual capital expenditures to maintain the Brookdale Portfolio and Ventas has agreed to consider making additional capital investments for a market return to align the parties' interests and further enhance the competitiveness and performance of the communities. Pro forma for the Agreement, Ventas has less than $2 million of seniors housing triple-net rent (0.1 percent of its total NOI) with renewals through the end of 2020, and the weighted average lease maturity on its entire triple-net leased portfolio is extended to 10 years.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Portfolio Performance\nFor the first quarter 2018, the Company’s same-store total property portfolio (1,049 assets) cash NOI grew 2.6 percent compared to the same period in 2017. Same-store cash NOI growth for the total portfolio and by segment for the first quarter 2018 follows:\nSame-Store Cash NOI Q1 2018 Reported Growth Triple-Net 4.4% Seniors Housing Operating Portfolio (“SHOP”) 0.7% Office 2.2% Total Company 2.6%\nFirst Quarter 2018 and Recent Highlights\nBuilding Winning Platforms: Ventas successfully transitioned management of an owned portfolio of over 70 private pay seniors housing communities to Eclipse Senior Living (“ESL”), a newly-formed, high-quality seniors housing operator founded by an experienced, results-driven team of senior living executives led by industry veteran Kai Hsiao. Ventas and ESL, which manages the portfolio under a management contract with Ventas, are well positioned to realize value from the portfolio through operational upside and the benefit of the coming demand wave of a growing senior population. Excellent Capital Allocation: Ventas demonstrated continued excellence in capital allocation, including: During and immediately following the quarter, Ventas sold properties and received final repayments on loans receivable for proceeds exceeding $300 million, including the full repayment of a well-secured, well-structured loan in the life sciences space. These proceeds were used to retire debt. The Company also committed to approximately $80 million of new investments in development and redevelopment projects in attractive markets, principally with Sunrise Senior Living in the New York metropolitan statistical area. Enhanced Balance Sheet Strength : The Company’s financial flexibility improved further at quarter end, including a sequential improvement of 0.2x in its net debt to Adjusted Pro Forma EBITDA ratio to 5.5x. To extend the Company’s weighted average debt maturity profile, Ventas also successfully issued $650 million of 4 percent senior notes due 2028 to retire $700 million of 2 percent senior notes that matured in February 2018. In addition, Ventas tendered and retired $600 million of 4 percent senior notes due 2019. Strengthened Best-in-Class Team: Peter J. Bulgarelli joined Ventas in April 2018 as Executive Vice President of Office and President and Chief Executive Officer of Lillibridge Healthcare Services, Inc. to lead the Company’s integrated 25 million square foot outpatient medical office building and university-based life science portfolio. Bulgarelli is a member of the Ventas executive leadership team and is based at the Company’s Chicago headquarters. Bulgarelli joins Ventas following a successful 28-year career at Jones Lang LaSalle, Incorporated (“JLL”), most recently leading JLL’s industry focused businesses including healthcare, life sciences and higher education, including academic medical centers.\nUpdated and Improved 2018 Guidance\nVentas updated its guidance ranges for 2018 income from continuing operations per share, NAREIT FFO per share and same-store cash NOI growth in addition to improving its expectations for 2018 normalized FFO per share. The Company’s current guidance ranges are as follows:\nFull Year 2018 Guidance 04/27/2018 Range Low High Income from Cont. Ops $1.21 ─ $1.26 NAREIT FFO $3.76 ─ $3.84 Normalized FFO $3.99 ─ $4.07 Full Year 2018 Projected Same-Store Cash NOI Growth 04/27/2018 Range Low High Triple-Net 2% ─ 3% SHOP (4%) ─ (1%) Office 1.75% ─ 2.75% Total Company 0.5% ─ 1.5% The Company’s updated normalized FFO per share guidance range of $3.99 to $4.07 represents a three-cent improvement at the midpoint compared to its previously disclosed guidance of $3.95 to $4.05, driven by the strong start to the year and the impact of the Brookdale Agreement.\nVentas’s updated same-store cash NOI growth guidance includes the impact of the cash rent credit on the Brookdale Portfolio beginning at the time of the Agreement, resulting in modestly lower forecasted 2018 same-store triple-net and total Company cash NOI growth compared to the Company’s previously disclosed guidance. Ventas’s SHOP and Office same-store cash NOI growth guidance ranges remain unchanged.\nThe Company now expects $1.25 billion in proceeds from asset dispositions and loan repayments for the full year 2018 at a GAAP rate of over eight percent, the proceeds of which will principally be used to retire debt. The Company has not included dispositions of the Brookdale Sale Assets in its updated guidance. The change in income from continuing operations per share guidance is principally driven by (a) the change in disposition assumptions and the related inclusion of the previously-described impairment on an equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture chiefly consisting of skilled nursing assets, which Ventas intends to sell in 2018; and (b) the previously-described non-cash expense related to the Brookdale Agreement.\nThe Company’s guidance does not include new acquisitions. Guidance continues to include the funding of $425 million for the full year 2018 in high-quality development and redevelopment projects, mostly in Ventas’s attractive university-based life science and medical office businesses. In addition, the Company expects proactive debt refinancing with longer-duration fixed rate debt to exceed $1 billion for the full year 2018.\nNo equity issuance is included in guidance. The 2018 outlook assumes 359 million weighted average fully-diluted shares. A reconciliation of the Company’s guidance to the Company’s projected GAAP measures is included in this press release.\nThe Company’s guidance is based on a number of other assumptions that are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company. If actual results vary from these assumptions, the Company’s expectations may change. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve these results.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Conference Call\nVentas will hold a conference call to discuss this earnings release today at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (9:00 a.m. Central Time).

Per share quarterly amounts may not add to annual per share amounts due to material changes in the Company’s weighted average diluted share count, if any.\nHistorical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. However, since real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors deem presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. For that reason, the Company considers FFO, normalized FFO, FAD and normalized FAD to be appropriate supplemental measures of operating performance of an equity REIT. In particular, the Company believes that normalized FFO is useful because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to compare the Company’s operating performance to the operating performance of other real estate companies and between periods on a consistent basis without having to account for differences caused by non-recurring items and other non-operational events such as transactions and litigation. In some cases, the Company provides information about identified non-cash components of FFO and normalized FFO because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to assess the impact of those items on the Company’s financial results.\nThe Company uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) definition of FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate property, including gains or losses on re-measurement of equity method investments, and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. The Company defines normalized FFO as FFO excluding the following income and expense items (which may be recurring in nature): (a) merger-related costs and expenses, including amortization of intangibles, transition and integration expenses, and deal costs and expenses, including expenses and recoveries relating to acquisition lawsuits; (b) the impact of any expenses related to asset impairment and valuation allowances, the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees, or additional costs, expenses, discounts, make-whole payments, penalties or premiums incurred as a result of early retirement or payment of the Company’s debt; (c) the non-cash effect of income tax benefits or expenses, the non-cash impact of changes to the Company’s executive equity compensation plan and derivative transactions that have non-cash mark-to-market impacts on the Company’s income statement; (d) the financial impact of contingent consideration, severance-related costs and charitable donations made to the Ventas Charitable Foundation; (e) gains and losses for non-operational foreign currency hedge agreements and changes in the fair value of financial instruments; (f) gains and losses on non-real estate dispositions and other unusual items related to unconsolidated entities; (g) expenses related to the re-audit and re-review in 2014 of the Company’s historical financial statements and related matters; and (h) net expenses or recoveries related to natural disasters. Normalized FAD represents normalized FFO excluding non-cash components, which include straight-line rental adjustments, and deducting capital expenditures, including certain tenant allowances and leasing commissions. FAD represents normalized FAD after subtracting merger-related expenses, deal costs and re-audit costs and other unusual items related to unconsolidated entities.\nFFO, normalized FFO, FAD and normalized FAD presented herein may not be comparable to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions. FFO, normalized FFO, FAD and normalized FAD should not be considered as alternatives to net income or income from continuing operations (both determined in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of the Company’s financial performance or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of the Company’s liquidity, nor are they necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company’s needs. The Company believes that income from continuing operations is the most comparable GAAP measure because it provides insight into the Company’s continuing operations. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the consolidated historical operating results of the Company, FFO, normalized FFO, FAD and normalized FAD should be examined in conjunction with net income and income from continuing operations as presented elsewhere herein.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES RECONCILIATION EPS, FFO and FAD Guidance Attributable to Common Stockholders 1,2\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Tentative / Preliminary and Subject to Change FY2018 - Guidance FY2018 - Per Share Low High Low High Income from Continuing Operations $435 $453 $1.21 $1.26 Gain on Real Estate Dispositions 29 39 0.08 0.11 Other Adjustments 3 (5 ) (6 ) (0.01 ) (0.02 ) Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders $459 $486 $1.28 $1.35 Depreciation and Amortization Adjustments 884 896 2.46 2.50 Gain on Real Estate Dispositions (29 ) (39 ) (0.08 ) (0.11 ) Other Adjustments 3 36 36 0.10 0.10 FFO (NAREIT) Attributable to Common Stockholders $1,350 $1,379 $3.76 $3.84 Merger-Related Expenses, Deal Costs and Re-Audit Costs 40 35 0.11 0.10 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt, Net 45 60 0.13 0.17 Other Adjustments 3,4 (3 ) (13 ) (0.01 ) (0.03 ) Normalized FFO Attributable to Common Stockholders $1,432 $1,461 $3.99 $4.07 % Year-Over-Year Growth (4 %) (2 %) Non-Cash Items Included in Normalized FFO 4 2 Capital Expenditures (139 ) (148 ) Normalized FAD Attributable to Common Stockholders $1,297 $1,315 Merger-Related Expense, Deal Costs and Re-Audit Costs (40 ) (35 ) Other Adjustments 3 (5 ) (4 ) FAD Attributable to Common Stockholders $1,252 $1,276 Weighted Average Diluted Shares (in millions) 359 359 1\nThe Company’s guidance constitutes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and is based on a number of assumptions that are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company.

The Company defines NOI as total revenues, less interest and other income, property-level operating expenses and office building services costs. In the case of NOI, cash receipts may differ due to straight-line recognition of certain rental income and the application of other GAAP policies. The Company believes that income from continuing operations is the most comparable GAAP measure for both NOI and same-store cash NOI because it provides insight into the Company’s continuing operations. The Company defines same-store as properties owned, consolidated, operational and reported under a consistent business model for the full period in both comparison periods, and excluding assets intended for disposition and for SHOP, those properties that transitioned operators after the start of the prior comparison period, and for office operations, redevelopment assets. To normalize for exchange rate movements, all same-store cash NOI measures assume constant exchange rates across comparable periods, using the following methodology: the current period’s results are shown in actual reported USD, while prior comparison period’s results are adjusted and converted to USD based on the average exchange rate for the current period.\nTriple-Net\nLeased\nProperties\nSenior Living\nOperations\nOffice\nOperations\nAll Other Total For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 Income from continuing operations $ 80,060 Adjustments: Interest and other income (9,634 ) Interest 111,363 Depreciation and amortization 233,150 General, administrative and professional fees 37,174 Loss on extinguishment of debt, net 10,977 Merger-related expenses and deal costs 17,336 Other 3,120 Loss from unconsolidated entities 40,739 Income tax benefit (3,242 ) Reported Segment NOI $ 191,783 $ 162,533 $ 134,994 $ 31,733 521,043 Adjustments: Modification fee — — 431 — 431 Normalizing adjustment for technology costs — 365 — — 365 NOI not included in same-store (12,994 ) (15,747 ) (15,462 ) — (44,203 ) Straight-lining of rental income 723 — (4,345 ) — (3,622 ) Non-cash rental income (2,741 ) — (289 ) — (3,030 ) Non-segment NOI — — — (31,733 ) (31,733 ) (15,012 ) (15,382 ) (19,665 ) (31,733 ) (81,792 ) Same-Store cash NOI (Constant Currency) $ 176,771 $ 147,151 $ 115,329 $ — $ 439,251 Percentage increase 4.4 % 0.7 % 2.2 % 2.6 %\nTriple-Net\nLeased\nProperties\nSenior Living\nOperations\nOffice\nOperations\nAll Other Total For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Income from continuing operations $ 155,912 Adjustments: Interest and other income (481 ) Interest 108,804 Depreciation and amortization 217,783 General, administrative and professional fees 33,961 Loss on extinguishment of debt, net 309 Merger-related expenses and deal costs 2,056 Other 1,188 Income from unconsolidated entities (3,150 ) Income tax benefit (3,145 ) Reported Segment NOI $ 210,532 $ 152,115 $ 130,174 $ 20,416 513,237 Adjustments: NOI not included in same-store (36,600 ) (6,821 ) (12,544 ) — (55,965 ) Straight-lining of rental income (666 ) — (4,711 ) — (5,377 ) Non-cash rental income (4,632 ) — (118 ) — (4,750 ) Non-segment NOI — — — (20,416 ) (20,416 ) NOI impact from change in FX 607 769 — — 1,376 (41,291 ) (6,052 ) (17,373 ) (20,416 ) (85,132 ) Same-Store cash NOI (Constant Currency) $ 169,241 $ 146,063 $ 112,801 $ — $ 428,105\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES RECONCILIATION NOI and Same-Store Cash NOI by Segment Guidance 1,2\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) FY2018 - Guidance Tentative / Preliminary and Subject to Change NNN SHOP Office Non-Segment Total High End Income from Continuing Operations $ 453 Depreciation and Amortization 3 906 Interest Expense, G&A, Other Income and Expenses 4 666 Reported Segment NOI 5 $ 739 $ 641 $ 542 $ 105 2,025 Normalizing Adjustment for Technology Costs 6 — 1 — — 1 Non-Cash and Non-Same-Store Adjustments (33 ) (74 ) (85 ) (105 ) (297 ) Same-Store Cash NOI 5 706 568 457 — 1,729 Percentage Increase 3.0 % (1.0 %) 2.75 % NM 1.5 % Modification Fees (3 ) — (0 ) — (3 ) Adjusted Same-Store Cash NOI 5 $ 703 $ 568 $ 457 $ — $ 1,726 Adjusted Percentage Increase 2.6 % (1.0 %) 2.7 % NM 1.3 % Low End Income from Continuing Operations $ 435 Depreciation and Amortization 3 896 Interest Expense, G&A, Other Income and Expenses 4 662 Reported Segment NOI 5 $ 732 $ 624 $ 537 $ 89 1,993 Normalizing Adjustment for Technology Costs 6 — 1 — — 1 Non-Cash and Non-Same-Store Adjustments (33 ) (74 ) (84 ) (89 ) (281 ) Same-Store Cash NOI 5 699 551 453 — 1,713 Percentage Increase 2.0 % (4.0 %) 1.75 % NM 0.5 % Modification Fees (3 ) — (0 ) — (3 ) Adjusted Same-Store Cash NOI 5 $ 696 $ 551 $ 453 $ — $ 1,710 Adjusted Percentage Increase 1.6 % (4.0 %) 1.7 % NM 0.3 % Prior Year Income from Continuing Operations $ 644 Depreciation and Amortization 3 888 Interest Expense, G&A, Other Income and Expenses 4 550 Reported Segment NOI $ 845 $ 593 $ 525 $ 119 2,082 Normalizing Adjustment for Technology Costs 6 — 3 — — 3 Non-Cash and Non-Same-Store Adjustments (162 ) (25 ) (80 ) (119 ) (386 ) NOI Impact from Change in FX 2 3 — — 5 Same-Store Cash NOI 685 574 445 — 1,704 Modification Fees — — — — — Adjusted Same-Store Cash NOI $ 685 $ 574 $ 445 $ — $ 1,704 2018 GBP (£) to USD ($) 1.41 USD ($) to CAD (C$) 1.26 1 The Company’s guidance constitutes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and is based on a number of assumptions that are subject to change and many of which are outside the control of the Company.
