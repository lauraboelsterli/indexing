    "text": "1 COMMENTS Good morning. Vice’s TV channel Viceland hasn’t exactly been a ratings juggernaut so far. But the network has big ambitions for its second annual “Weed Week.” “ It’s our ‘Shark Week ’,” Viceland Senior Director of Marketing Michele Beno told the Drum. The five days of marijuana programming produced the channel’s best ratings last year, and Viceland is hoping new commercials, which used 20 pounds of the green stuff ( 453 felony offenses in Florida , Ad Age points out), plus an event in Washington, D.C. today where fans can “Smoke Weed With Jeff Sessions” (not the attorney general, but a guy with the same name) will get viewers hooked this time around.\nNever Gonna Give You Up Now that we’ve had time to digest Mark Zuckerberg’s trip to Capitol Hill, how are advertisers reacting as the Cambridge Analytica scandal continues to unravel? We heard last month that a handful of brands suspended advertising on Facebook. Ad Age reported 20th Century Fox also canceled a planned Facebook Messenger Chatbot launch for its “Deadpool” brand, fearing users may be concerned about the data they were sharing in light of recent headlines. Despite the smattering of small holdouts, overall, advertisers aren’t pulling back. Data from media planning and buying platform 4C suggests ad spend on Facebook increased 7.2% week-on-week from March 17 (when the Guardian’s first Cambridge Analytica article dropped) to March 23. Facebook ad spend from March 24 to March 30 rose 14.5% week-on-week. “As long as ROI (return on investment) is there, advertisers won’t stop investing in Facebook altogether,” 4C Chief Marketing Officer Aaron Goldman said. Indeed, Facebook Vice President of Global Marketing Solutions Carolyn Everson said Thursday at The Wall Street Journal CEO Council in London, “ We are not anticipating major changes to our overall revenue and business model.”\n—Open Heart Surgery—\nBut might the Cambridge Analytica fallout cause Facebook ad revenue pain in the long term? Dean Crutchfield, a New York-based independent branding consultant, likened the Capitol Hill hearings to “open heart surgery:” While the patient (Facebook) will be closed up and there might not be an immediate impact on its business, there will still be a scar, which eventually could find its form in regulation or a dent in perception of the company among consumers. One of the biggest issues for the advertising community is that the data-driven business model of digital advertising has become a dinner-table conversation and some consumers are now actively checking and reducing the amount of data they share, Mr. Crutchfield said. (Ms. Everson said Thursday that users largely haven’t changed their privacy settings in the past four weeks.) One senior ad buyer, speaking to CMO Today’s Alex Bruell, said questions still remain around whether lawmakers pass restrictive regulations on tech companies, “If indeed the U.S. adopts a Euro-like law, that’s bad news for advertisers with limited information about their own customers. No more shortcuts via third-party data. Advertisers who have invested a lot in CRM (customer-relationship management) efforts will fare best.”\nPresident Iger The small matter of Disney’s $52.4 billion deal to acquire 21st Century Fox assets appears to have stopped short Chief Executive Robert Iger’s bid for the U.S. presidency. That’s the key revelation in Vogue’s profile of Mr. Iger, who was seriously exploring a run . “I really, really pushed him to run for president, so much so that I said to him, ‘Gee, if you ever decide to run for office, I will go door to door carrying leaflets. I will go sit and have tea with people,’” Mr. Iger’s pal Oprah Winfrey said. Elsewhere in Disney-related news, ESPN launched its direct-to-consumer service ESPN+ on Thursday. ESPN’s challenge will be to attract viewers who don’t want to pay for cable without losing the business of those who currently do, WSJ’s Shalini Ramachandran reports. The target market falls in three categories of sports fans: core ESPN users hungry for more sports; fans of niche sports like rugby; and the underserved fan who can’t find sports from his or her alma mater on traditional TV.\nIt’s Not About the Money, Money, Money CMO Today’s Alex Bruell reports : From client cutbacks to new marketing challenges, 2017 was a tough year for the CEOs of the top ad holding companies, including Interpublic Group of Cos. and Omnicom Group. Their pay packets took a hit, too. According to Omnicom’s proxy filing, Chief Executive John Wren received total compensation of almost $24 million, including cash bonus, equity and base salary, down from almost $26 million in 2016. Also of note in the proxy, filed Thursday, Omnicom said Bruce Crawford will be retiring as chairman this year, with Mr. Wren replacing him. At IPG, CEO Michael Roth received total compensation of almost $17 million in 2017, compared with about $18 million the year before. Mr. Wren’s total compensation was approximately 596 times the pay of Omnicom’s median employee, who earned a little more than $40,000 last year. This year marks the first time companies are required by law to disclose such a pay ratio. Mr. Roth’s compensation was approximately 264 times higher than the median employee, who earned almost $64,000 last year.\nBest of the rest Facebook updated the terms and conditions for its Business Tools earlier this week. Here’s a handy guide on the changes marketers need to be aware of. [ Marketing Land ]\nA publisher source says their views on Snapchat’s Discover section have dropped by “more than half” since the app’s redesign. [ New York Magazine ]\nAmplitude, AppsFlyer, Braze and mParticle have formed a consortium called OpenGDPR that will supply clients with a framework to ready themselves for the forthcoming EU data protection regulation. [ Adweek ]\nA judge has dismissed a lawsuit from Anthony Pompliano, a former Snap employee who had accused the company of juicing its growth metrics. The judge granted Snap’s motion to move the matter into private arbitration. [ Variety ]\nUnivision laid off more than 150 people Thursday across the business, including at Fusion Media Group. [ The Information ]\nTronc laid off several dozen employees Thursday. Also out the door is Tribune Interactive Chief Content Officer Lewis D’Vorkin who said the decision to leave the company was mutual. [ Los Angeles Times ]\nWPP’s MediaCom retained Sky’s estimated £425 million business earlier this week, after a monthslong review. Sky UK Chief Executive Stephen van Rooyen said the partnership sets “industry-leading standards for the transparency and accountability of media-buying practices.” [ Campaign ]\nAbout Us Follow us on Twitter: @wsjCMO , @larakiara , @VranicaWSJ , @alexbruell , @BenMullin , @srabil , @asharma\nSubscribe to our morning newsletter, delivered straight to your inbox, at http://on.wsj.com/CMOTodaySignup .\nWrite to Lara O’Reilly at lara.oreilly@wsj.com",
