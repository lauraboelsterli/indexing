    "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Jan Klatten, the husband of Germany’s richest woman, has slightly increased his stake in German wind turbine maker Nordex ( NDXG.DE ), according to a regulatory filing published by the company on Wednesday.\nVia momentum-capital Vermoegensverwaltungsgesellschaft mbH, Klatten, who also sits on Nordex’s supervisory board, bought 502,406 euros ($616,703) worth of Nordex stock at an average price of 7.13 euros a share.\nShares in the group, the world’s sixth-largest maker of wind turbines, rose 5.2 percent on the news to 7.78 euros apiece. Its shares have lost 12 percent year-to-date.\nTogether with SKion - which is owned by Susanne Klatten, one of the largest shareholders in luxury carmaker BMW ( BMWG.DE ) - momentum holds 5.71 percent in Nordex, making them the second-largest investor after Spain’s Acciona ( ANA.MC ).\nNordex last week forecast a recovery in Germany, its largest market by sales, by 2020, helped by easing pricing pressure, efficiencies and an expected pick-up in demand.\n($1 = 0.8147 euros)\nReporting by Christoph Steitz; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ",
