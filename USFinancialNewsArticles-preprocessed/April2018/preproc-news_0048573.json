    "text": "MADRID, Banco Santander opened Spain’s bank reporting season on Tuesday with a 10 percent rise in first-quarter net profit from a year earlier, beating analysts’ forecasts and helped by strong business in its largest market Brazil.\nSantander, the euro zone’s biggest bank by market value, reported net profit of 2.05 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in the first three months of the year against forecasts of 2.01 billion euros in a Reuters poll.\nNet interest income, a measure of earnings on loans minus deposit costs, was 8.45 billion euros, up 0.6 percent from a year ago. Analysts expected NII to come in at 8.49 billion. In Brazil, where it makes about 26 percent of its profits, net profit improved 7 percent on the year.\n$1 = 0.8191 euros Reporting By Jesús Aguado; editing by Paul Day\n ",
