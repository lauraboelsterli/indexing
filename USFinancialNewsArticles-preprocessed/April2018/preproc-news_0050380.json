    "text": "April 23, 2018 / 11:19 AM / Updated 14 minutes ago Asylum-seekers and locals clash on Greek island of Lesbos over migrant crisis Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nATHENS (Reuters) - Clashes broke out on Sunday between asylum-seekers and groups of locals on Lesbos, police said, in one of the most serious bouts of violence on the Greek island in months. \nLocals were protesting against a group of about 200 refugees and migrants who had camped out for days on a main square on the island’s seaside promenade, a police official on the island said. The asylum-seekers were demonstrating against conditions in the island’s camp and delays in asylum applications. \nVideo footage on a local news website showed riot police moving in to disperse the crowd which had set several garbage containers on fire. \nThe clashes, which began on Sunday evening, lasted well into the early hours of Monday, the official said. \nMedia reported that far-right supporters were among the protesters. Lesbos Mayor Spiros Galinos described the protest as a “spontaneous reaction” but added: “If persons of extreme ideological beliefs took part in this reaction, it was to be expected.” \nLesbos was the main gateway to Europe for nearly a million refugees and migrants in 2015. Arrivals have slowed significantly since a European Union deal with Turkey in 2016 but a steady flow is putting pressure on island facilities. \nIts main camp, Moria is holding more than double the number of people it was intended to. \n“For the last three years, Lesbos has been experiencing an unprecedented situation. It’s carrying a huge burden,” Galinos told Greece’s Skai TV. “I’m trying to convince the government that Lesbos cannot carry this burden indefinitely.” Reporting by Karolina Tagaris; Editing by Toby Chopra",
