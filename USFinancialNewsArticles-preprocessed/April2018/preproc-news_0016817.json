    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May agreed with U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday that the world needed to respond to reports of a chemical weapons attack in Syria, Downing Street said.\nMay, who held separate calls with the two leaders on Tuesday, agreed that reports of a chemical weapons attack in Syria were “utterly reprehensible” and if confirmed, represented further evidence of the appalling cruelty shown by the regime of Bashar al-Assad.\n“They agreed that the international community needed to respond to uphold the worldwide prohibition on the use of chemical weapons,” a spokeswoman from May’s office said after the call.\nReporting by William James, editing by Kate Holton and Guy Faulconbridge\n ",
