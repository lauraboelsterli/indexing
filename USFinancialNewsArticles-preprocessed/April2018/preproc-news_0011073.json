    "text": "SAN MATEO, Calif., April 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SignalFx , the leader in real-time operational intelligence for data-driven DevOps, today announced it has expanded its C-suite with two key appointments: Marzena Fuller as Chief Security Officer (CSO) and Mark Resnick as Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Fuller and Resnick join SignalFx to support the company’s rapidly expanding customer base, strong revenue growth, new partnerships, integrations, and geographic expansion. The new appointments follow extensive leadership additions in 2017 and the launch of its European operations in March 2018.\n“We’re at an inflection point as more enterprises are embracing digital transformation and turning to SignalFx as their strategic partner for monitoring their cloud environments in real-time. We’re thrilled to welcome Marzena and Mark to the team that will take SignalFx to the next level,” said Karthik Rau, co-founder and CEO of SignalFx. “With their deep expertise and proven track-records, Marzena and Mark are ideally suited to help achieve our strategic security and financial goals to benefit our customers, employees, and stakeholders.”\nMarzena Fuller will lead SignalFx’s security operations, helping the company maintain the highest level of security standards for SignalFx and its enterprise customers. She has extensive experience building security, risk, and compliance programs at big data and machine learning companies, and bringing a customer-oriented approach to information security. Fuller was previously Senior Director Security at Databricks where she was responsible for developing and implementing the company’s security and compliance strategy. Prior to Databricks, she worked as Director, Security Compliance at Sumo Logic, overseeing the organization’s security, compliance, privacy, risk and data protection programs.\n“SignalFx understands that enterprises need to be able to trust their providers with confidential data and assets, so the company takes its stewardship of client data very seriously,” said Fuller. “I’m excited to help our customers and the SignalFx team standardize and scale best-in-class security practices.”\nWith 30 years of financial experience, Mark Resnick will oversee financial planning, accounting, and financial reporting. Prior to SignalFx, Resnick served as CFO at WePay where he led the company through its acquisition by JPMorgan Chase & Co. Prior to that, Resnick held executive roles including: Chief Operating Officer (COO) and CFO at Vindicia; COO and CFO at Transera Communications; CFO at Coremetrics, where he helped raise more than $110 million in venture funding prior to the company being acquired by IBM; and CFO at CrossLogix, successfully restructuring the company ahead of its acquisition by BEA Systems.\n\"This is an exciting time in SignalFx’s growth trajectory as the company leads the charge in enabling enterprises to successfully manage cloud-native architectures,” said Resnick. “I look forward to working closely with the leadership team to drive increased profitability and support the company’s long-term growth strategy.\"\nAbout SignalFx\nSignalFx is the leader in real-time operational intelligence for data-driven DevOps.
