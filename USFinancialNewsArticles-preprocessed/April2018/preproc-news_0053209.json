    "text": "Chicago White Sox first baseman Matt Davidson continued his assault on Kansas City pitching with two homers and Yoan Moncada added three hits and a homer in a 6-3 victory over the Royals at Kauffman Stadium on Thursday.\nThe White Sox hit five home runs in all.\nDavidson hit a bases-empty homer in the fourth inning and a two-run shot for a 6-2 lead in the sixth, giving him five homers in 10 at-bats at Kauffman Stadium this season. He had three homers against the Royals in a 14-7 victory on opening day.\nWelington Castillo and Trayce Thompson also hit bases-empty homers for the White Sox, who had lost nine of 10 and 16 of 19.\nJorge Soler had two hits including a two-run homer and Mike Moustakas, Salvador Perez, Abraham Almonte and Ryan Goins had two hits apiece for the Royals, who have lost 13 of 15 and are 1-10 at home.\nAlcides Escobar singled in a run in the eighth inning to make it 6-3 before Joakim Soria pitched the ninth for his third save.\nWhite Sox right-hander Lucas Giolito (1-3) gave up five hits and two runs in 5 2/3 innings. He struck out two and walked two.\nJakob Junis (3-2) gave up all five White Sox homers while allowing six runs and six hits in 5 2/3 innings. He struck out five and walked two. Junis has been touched for eight homers in his last 18 2/3 innings after giving up three in a 5-3 loss to the Angels on April 14.\nMoncada hit the second pitch of the game for his sixth homer, his second leadoff homer in as many games. He took Seattle right-hander Felix Hernandez deep on the first pitch of the last of the first inning in a 4-3 loss Wednesday.\nCastillo homered with one out in the fourth inning and Davidson hit his first of the game with two out for a 3-0 lead.\nMoustakas singled behind second base to lead off the fourth inning, the Royals’ first hit off Giolito, and two outs later Soler homered to make it 3-2.\nThompson led off the fifth with his second homer of the season for a 4-2 lead.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
