    "text": "Published: Apr 4, 2018 4:58 p.m. ET Share \nOnly 29% of Nike VPs are women, and just 16% are nonwhite Getty Images The main entrance of Nike’s headquarters in Beaverton, Ore. \nBy Sara Germano \nNike Inc.’s top human-resources executive told employees Wednesday that the sportswear giant “has failed to gain traction” in hiring and promoting women and minorities, weeks after complaints of inappropriate workplace behavior led to a leadership shake-up. \nIn a memo to staff reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Monique Matheson wrote that the company wants “to create a culture of true inclusion. As part of our plan, we need to improve representation of women and people of color.” \n“While we’ve spoken about this many times, and tried different ways to achieve change, we have failed to gain traction — and our hiring and promotion decisions are not changing senior-level representation as quickly as we have wanted,” she wrote. \nMatheson disclosed that 29% of the company’s vice presidents are women, even though the company’s global workforce is evenly split between men and women. In the U.S., 16% of vice presidents are nonwhite, she wrote. Nike NKE, +2.58% , which has 74,000 employees, has several hundred vice presidents, according to people familiar with the matter.",
