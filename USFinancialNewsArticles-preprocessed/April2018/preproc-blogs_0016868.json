    "text": "GRAINS-Wheat retreats from near one-month high despite further crop damage Colin Packham \n* Wheat falls for first time in four sessions \n* Soybeans rally more than 0.5 pct \n* Corn edges higher \nSYDNEY,   U.S. wheat futures fell for the first time in four sessions on Tuesday to retreat from a near one-month high, though losses were checked as the U.S. Department of Agriculture pegged the condition of the crop below market forecasts. Soybeans rose more than 0.5 percent as traders shrugged off the threat of a trade war between the United States and China, while corn also edged higher. The most active wheat futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade eased 0.5 percent to $4.88-1/2 a bushel by 0328 GMT after closing up 3.9 percent in the previous session when prices hit 4.93-3/4 a bushel - the highest since March 13. Analysts said confirmation by the USDA that crops have suffered further damage last week heightens concerns about yield prospects as cold weather grips several key producing regions. \"Temperatures were low enough in some of the Hard Red Wheat region to damage crops. Crops in part of the cold region were already likely to be low yielding, if at all, so extra crop loss is modest. The cold region though was not restricted to just the drought-blighted ones,\" said Tobin Gorey, director of agricultural strategy, Commonwealth Bank of Australia. U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) rated 30 percent of the U.S. winter wheat crop in good to excellent condition, down from 32 percent a week earlier and 53 percent a year ago. The figure fell below an average of analyst expectations for 31 percent. The most active soybean futures were up 0.7 percent to $10.54-1/4 a bushel, after closing up 1.3 percent on Monday. The most active corn futures were up 0.1 percent at $3.90-1/4 a bushel, having closed up 0.6 percent in the previous session Soybeans got a boost from fresh export business, including confirmation from the USDA on Monday that private exporters sold another 232,500 tonnes of U.S. soybeans to unknown destinations. \nThe USDA said the U.S. corn crop was 2 percent planted by Sunday, in line with trade expectations, but down from 3 percent a year ago. \nGrains prices at 0328 GMT \nContract Last Change Pct chg Two-day chg MA 30 RSI CBOT wheat 488.50 -2.25 -0.46% +3.44% 475.03 72 CBOT corn 391.00 0.25 +0.06% +0.64% 384.08 67 CBOT soy 1054.25 7.25 +0.69% +1.98% 1042.61 65 CBOT rice 12.82 $0.00 +0.00% +2.60% $12.42 80 WTI crude 63.79 $0.37 +0.58% +2.79% $62.85 52 \nCurrencies \nEuro/dlr $1.231 -$0.001 -0.06% +0.25% USD/AUD 0.7730 0.003 +0.43% +0.72% \nMost active contracts Wheat, corn and soy US cents/bushel.
