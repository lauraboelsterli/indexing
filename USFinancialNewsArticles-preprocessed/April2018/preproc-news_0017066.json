    "text": "Xukai Shen, a geophysicist working at BP Plc, had a hunch he could solve a riddle that had vexed the company: whether there was a lot of oil hidden beneath a salt dome 7,000 feet underwater in the Gulf of Mexico. So he asked to use the company’s supercomputer exclusively for two weeks to check it out.\n\nUsing an algorithm, the 33-year-old with a Stanford PhD harnessed the computer’s massive power last year to produce a clearer seismic image of what lay beneath. The result: a potentially massive oil find. With a clearer picture...  ",
