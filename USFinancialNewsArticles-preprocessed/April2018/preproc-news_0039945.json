    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (“Ubiquiti” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:UBNT) and certain of its officers. The class action, filed in United States District Court, Southern District of New York, and docketed under 18-cv-01841, is on behalf of a class consisting of investors who purchased or otherwise acquired Ubiquiti securities, seeking to recover compensable damages caused by defendants’ violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\nIf you are a shareholder who purchased Ubiquiti securities between May 9, 2013, and February 16, 2018, both dates inclusive, you have until April 23, 2018, to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com . To discuss this action, contact Robert S. Willoughby at rswilloughby@pomlaw.com or 888.476.6529 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll-free, Ext. 9980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and the number of shares purchased.\n[Click here to join this class action]\nUbiquiti develops technology platforms for high-capacity distributed Internet access, unified information technology, and next-generation consumer electronics for home and personal use. The Company does not employ a traditional sales force. Instead, it purports to “drive[] brand awareness largely through the company’s user community where customers can interface directly with R&D, marketing, and support.” The Company calls this user community the “Ubiquiti Community.”\nThe Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the number of the Company’s purported user community was drastically overstated; (ii) Ubiquiti had exaggerated its publicly reported accounts receivable; and (iii) as a result of the foregoing, Ubiquiti’s publicly disseminated financial statements were materially false and misleading.\nOn September 18, 2017, Citron Research (“Citron”) issued a report entitled “Cintron Exposes Ubiquiti Networks,” (the “Citron Report”) in which Citron detailed a series of “alarming red flags,” indicating that the Company had been deceiving investors and was engaged in “corporate fraud,” including, among other things, that the Company had misrepresented the size of its purported “Ubiquiti Community”, as well as its levels of accounts receivable, among other things.\nOn February 20, 2018, Ubiquiti filed a form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission stating, in material part: “On February 13, 2018, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ‘SEC’) issued subpoenas to Ubiquiti Networks, Inc. (the ‘Company’) and certain of the Company’s officers requesting documents and information relating to a range of topics, including metrics relating to the Ubiquiti Community, accounting practices, financial information, auditors, international trade practices, and relationships with distributors and various other third parties.”\nOn the news of the SEC subpoenas, Ubiquiti’s share price fell more than 25 percent, from $74.04 at the close of the prior trading day, to close at $55.28 on February 20, 2018.\nThe Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Paris, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 80 years later, the Pomerantz Firm continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members.
