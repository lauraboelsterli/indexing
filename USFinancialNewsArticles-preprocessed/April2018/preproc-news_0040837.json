Signature Bank Remains Significantly Above FDIC “Well Capitalized” Standards. Tangible Common Equity Ratio was 8.95 Percent In the 2018 First Quarter, the Bank Appointed Two Private Client Banking Teams and Appointed Two Veteran Bankers to Head the Bank’s West Coast Operations\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Signature Bank (Nasdaq: SBNY), a New York-based full-service commercial bank, today announced results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nNet income for the 2018 first quarter was $34.5 million, or $0.63 diluted earnings per share, versus $133.9 million, or $2.48 diluted earnings per share, for the 2017 first quarter. The decrease in net income for the 2018 first quarter, versus the comparable quarter last year, is due to an increase of $121.1 million in the provision for loan losses, nearly all attributable to the New York City taxi medallion portfolio. Excluding write-downs for the taxi medallion portfolio, net income would have been a record $146.8 million, or $2.69 diluted earnings per share.\nNet interest income for the 2018 first quarter reached $318.1 million, up $16.4 million, or 5.4 percent, when compared with the 2017 first quarter. This increase is primarily due to growth in average interest-earning assets. Total assets reached $44.44 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $4.17 billion, or 10.4 percent, from $40.27 billion at March 31, 2017. Average assets for the 2018 first quarter reached $43.67 billion, an increase of $4.04 billion, or 10.2 percent, compared with the 2017 first quarter.\nDeposits for the 2018 first quarter rose $1.38 billion, or 4.1 percent, to $34.82 billion at March 31, 2018. When compared with deposits at March 31, 2017, overall deposit growth for the last twelve months was 5.7 percent, or $1.88 billion. Average deposits for the 2018 first quarter reached $34.22 billion, an increase of $197.6 million, or 0.6 percent.\n“Signature Bank welcomed 2018 by delivering a strong first quarter of core growth and earnings, and taking additional steps to effectively address our taxi medallion portfolio. During the quarter, we already added two new private client banking teams to our network, and appointed two leading banking veterans to head our West Coast operations. With this additional expertise, we are expanding our San Francisco accommodation location into a full-service private client banking office, located downtown in a thriving area of the city. These initiatives are paving the way for our growth and expansion on both coasts,” explained Joseph J. DePaolo, Co-founder, President and Chief Executive Officer.\n“We are also making headway on several fronts we previously discussed, including a revamped credit management structure that has revitalized our commercial and industrial lending while maintaining our momentum across all lending activities. Additionally, we are making further progress on the updating of the Bank’s infrastructure as it relates to our loan origination systems, payments architecture platform and foreign exchange system. And, we are also cautiously optimistic with Congress’s progress towards raising the Systematically Important Financial Institution (SIFI) threshold, which stands to benefit banks of our size and scope. All of these actions place Signature Bank on solid footing as we kick off 2018,” DePaolo concluded.\n“The banking industry is undergoing a transitional period of remarkable change across many fronts, as indicated by the level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, the regulatory environment, legislation possibilities and the dramatic developments in financial technologies. It is during these types of transformational periods that Signature Bank’s clients rely upon our dedicated team of financial professionals to help them navigate, plan and capitalize on the right opportunities,” explained Scott A. Shay, Chairman of the Board.\n“In a similar vein, at Signature Bank, we also closely scrutinize this rapidly changing banking environment to seek new opportunities to best serve our clients and enable them to succeed. We recognize the safest organizations are those that are nimble and can adapt and adjust along with changing environments. With that top of mind, we ensure all our efforts align with our central mission to be that safe, sleep-at-night institution for all our clients,” Shay said.\nCapital\nThe Bank’s Tier 1 leverage, common equity Tier 1 risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, and total risk-based capital ratios were approximately 9.47 percent, 12.08 percent, 12.08 percent, and 13.44 percent, respectively, as of March 31, 2018. Each of these ratios is well in excess of regulatory requirements. The Bank’s strong risk-based capital ratios reflect the relatively low risk profile of the Bank’s balance sheet. The Bank’s tangible common equity ratio remains strong at 8.95 percent. The Bank defines tangible common equity ratio as the ratio of tangible common equity to adjusted tangible assets and calculates this ratio by dividing total consolidated common shareholders’ equity by consolidated total assets.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the 2018 first quarter was $318.1 million, an increase of $16.3 million, or 5.4 percent, versus the same period last year, primarily due to growth in average interest-earning assets. Average interest-earning assets of $43.01 billion for the 2018 first quarter represent an increase of $3.90 billion, or 10.0 percent, from the 2017 first quarter. Yield on interest-earning assets for the 2018 first quarter increased 11 basis points to 3.75 percent, compared to the first quarter of last year.\nAverage cost of deposits and average cost of funds for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 21 and 26 basis points, to 0.65 percent and 0.82 percent, respectively versus the comparable period a year ago.\nNet interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis for the 2018 first quarter was 3.01 percent versus 3.14 percent reported in the 2017 first quarter and 3.07 percent in the 2017 fourth quarter. Excluding loan prepayment penalties in both quarters, linked quarter core margin on a tax-equivalent basis decreased three basis points to 2.95 percent.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe Bank’s provision for loan losses for the first quarter of 2018 was $140.8 million, compared with $41.7 million for the 2017 fourth quarter and $19.6 million for the 2017 first quarter. The elevated provision for the 2018 first quarter was nearly all due to the New York City taxi medallion loan portfolio.\nNet charge offs for the 2018 first quarter were $128.3 million, or 1.58 percent of average loans, on an annualized basis, versus net charge offs of $38.8 million, or 0.48 percent, for the 2017 fourth quarter and $9.2 million, or 0.13 percent, for the 2017 first quarter. The 2018 first quarter net charge-offs included $128.6 million for taxi medallion loans.\nNon-Interest Income and Non-Interest Expense\nNon-interest income for the 2018 first quarter was $7.2 million, down $2.7 million when compared with $9.9 million reported in the 2017 first quarter. The decrease was driven by an increase in other losses from additional amortization of low income housing tax credit investments.\nNon-interest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $137.3 million, an increase of $34.1 million, or 33.1 percent, versus $103.2 million reported in the 2017 first quarter. The increase was primarily a result of write-downs of $24.0 million on repossessed New York City taxi medallions, the addition of new private client banking teams, as well as an increase in costs in our risk management and compliance related activities. The Bank also incurred additional FDIC assessment fees.\nThe Bank’s efficiency ratio increased to 42.2 percent (or, 34.4 percent excluding write-downs on the repossessed medallions) for the 2018 first quarter versus 33.1 percent for the comparable period last year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in other general and administrative expenses of $25.0 million primarily due to the aforementioned write-down on the repossessed medallions.\nLoans\nLoans, excluding loans held for sale, grew $634.7 million, or 1.9 percent, during the first quarter of 2018 to $33.25 billion, compared with $32.61 billion at December 31, 2017. Excluding payoffs and charge-offs of $160.7 million on taxi medallion loans, total loans would have grown $795.4 million. At March 31, 2018, loans accounted for 74.8 percent of total assets, versus 75.6 percent at the end of the 2017 fourth quarter and 74.6 percent at the end of 2017 first quarter. Average loans, excluding loans held for sale, reached $32.94 billion in the 2018 first quarter, growing $1.16 billion, or 3.6 percent, from the 2017 fourth quarter and $3.33 billion, or 11.3 percent, from the 2017 first quarter. The increase in loans for the first quarter was primarily driven by growth in commercial real estate and multi-family loans.\nAt March 31, 2018, non-accrual loans were $168.7 million, representing 0.51 percent of total loans and 0.38 percent of total assets, compared with non-accrual loans of $326.9 million, or 1.00 percent of total loans, at December 31, 2017 and $225.9 million, or 0.75 percent of total loans, at March 31, 2017. Excluding non-accruing loans secured by taxi medallions of $149.2 million, non-accrual loans for the remainder of the portfolio are $19.5 million, or six basis points of total loans. The ratio of allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans at March 31, 2018 was 0.63 percent, versus 0.60 percent at December 31, 2017 and 0.75 percent at March 31, 2017. Additionally, the ratio of allowance for loan and lease losses to non-accrual loans, or the coverage ratio, was 124 percent for the 2018 first quarter versus 60 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 99 percent for the 2017 first quarter.\nConference Call\nSignature Bank’s management will host a conference call to review results of the 2018 first quarter on Thursday, April 19, 2018, at 10:00 AM ET.

These non-GAAP measures include the Bank's (i) Net income and diluted earnings per share (as reported) to net income and diluted earnings per share excluding write-downs and fair value adjustments for the taxi medallion portfolio, (ii) change in loans and leases excluding payoffs and charge-offs on taxi medallion loans, (iii) tangible common equity ratio, (iv) efficiency ratio, (v) efficiency ratio excluding fair value adjustments related to repossessed taxi medallions,(vi) yield on interest-earning assets, tax-equivalent basis, and (vii) core net interest margin, tax-equivalent basis excluding loan prepayment penalty income. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP-basis measures and results. We strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies’ non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.
