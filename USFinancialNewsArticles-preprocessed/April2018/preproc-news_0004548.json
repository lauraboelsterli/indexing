We welcome the customers, employees, and shareholders of CSBK to the Kearny family,” said Craig L. Montanaro, President and CEO of Kearny Bank.\nKeefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. served as financial advisor to Kearny, and Luse Gorman, PC served as its legal counsel.

These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about (i) the benefits of the merger between Kearny and Clifton, including anticipated future results, cost savings and accretion to reported earnings that may be realized from the merger; (ii) Kearny and Clifton’s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements contained in this presentation that are not historical facts; and (iii) other statements identified by words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates” or words of similar meaning. Annualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purpose only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results.\nForward-looking statements involve that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in such statements. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results expressed in the forward-looking statements: the cost savings from the merger may not be fully realized or may take longer than expected to be realized; operating costs, customer loss and business disruption following the merger may be greater than expected; the interest rate environment may further compress margins and adversely affect net interest income; the risks associated with continued diversification of assets and adverse changes to credit quality; and difficulties associated with achieving expected future financial results. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements are discussed in Kearny’s reports (such as the Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and available at the SEC’s Internet website ( www.sec.gov ). All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning the proposed transaction or other matters attributable to Kearny or any person acting on their behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above.
