    "text": "(Reuters) - General Motors Co ( GM.N ) will stop production of its subcompact Chevrolet Sonic by as early as this year, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\nFILE PHOTO: The GM logo is seen at the General Motors Warren Transmission Operations Plant in Warren, Michigan, U.S., October 26, 2015. REUTERS/Rebecca Cook/File Photo While GM is also planning to discontinue Chevrolet Impala in the next few years, Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) will stop making the Fiesta small car for the U.S. market by as early as next year, and discontinue the Taurus sedan, the Journal reported.\nThe move comes at a time when U.S. consumers are increasingly shunning passenger cars in favor of more comfortable sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and pickup trucks.\nFord executives are still considering the future of Fusion cars, the report said.\nGeneral Motors declined to comment, while Ford was not immediately available for comment.\nLast month, Ford disclosed plans to shift the product portfolio from passenger cars to SUVs, add more hybrid and pure electric vehicles, and cut manufacturing costs.\nDemand for sport utility vehicles in the United States is booming, with the number of new models vying for a share of the market growing even faster.\nLast month, GM unveiled a revamped luxury pickup truck, intensifying the battle among Detroitâ€™s big three automakers for fat profits at the top end of a highly lucrative segment.\nReporting by Arunima Banerjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur\n ",
