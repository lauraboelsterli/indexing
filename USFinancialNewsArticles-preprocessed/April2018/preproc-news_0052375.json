FILE PHOTO: An Alitalia Airbus A320-200 passenger aircraft takes off at Fiumicino International Airport in Rome, Italy January 15, 2018. REUTERS/Max Rossi/File Photo\n“The way Alitalia looks today is of absolutely no interest at all,” Chief Financial Officer Ulrik Svensson told an call for analysts on Thursday.\nLufthansa said earlier this month it had submitted a documenting setting out its ideas for a “new” Alitalia.\nItalian paper Il Sole 24 Ore has reported that Lufthansa was expected to eventually enter exclusive negotiations to buy Alitalia.\nSvensson also declined to comment on whether Lufthansa had made an inquiry into low-cost rival Norwegian Air following its advance from British Airways-owner IAG.
