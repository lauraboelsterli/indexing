For 17 years, Ms. Hendrix was employed with SunBridge, which is now Genesis Healthcare.\n\"I've spent a career finding ways to reduce nursing deficiencies and improve long term care and resident outcomes,\" said Ms. Hendrix. \"Whether it's creating retention programs that are proven to reduce turnover among our most skilled nurses, developing internal education programs, or implementing procedures to improve compliance with health department directives, it all comes down to creating better outcomes for our residents.\"\nKenny Rozenberg, CEO of Centers Health Care, highlights that Ms. Hendrix comes equipped with the large scale organizational experience that Centers was searching for.\n\"Centers Health Care has always had strong leadership on our clinical teams, leaders that placed great emphasis on training, motivation and demonstrable effectiveness,\" Rozenberg said.

The company offers assisted living, adult day health care, medical transportation, urgent care, managed long term care, home care and a host of post-acute specialty services.\n\"In order to help us effectively manage the growth we've experienced and our continued growth in the future, we needed to add someone to the team who has done it already and has a proven track record of success,\" added Rozenberg. Ms. Hendrix, who will be working from the company's Bronx, New York headquarters, will have a noticeable presence in all of Centers' facilities. \"Nursing happens at the facility level and no matter how large the company, that's where the real leadership happens.\"\nMs. Hendrix received her Registered Nursing Degree from Northwest Shoals Community College, Phil Campbell, Alabama in 1993 and her BSN from Oklahoma Christian University in Edmond, OK in August 2016.\nAbout Centers Health Care\nCenters Health Care is one of the largest and most complete post-acute health care continuums in the northeast.
