    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) today reported worldwide Net sales of $4,002 million in first quarter 2018, an increase of 6.5% versus first quarter 2017. Global unit volume increased 2.0%, pricing was even with the year ago period and foreign exchange was positive 4.5%. The previously disclosed professional skin care acquisitions contributed 0.5% to unit volume growth. Organic sales (Net sales excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) increased 1.5%.\nNet income and Diluted earnings per share in first quarter 2018 were $634 million and $0.72, respectively. Net income in first quarter 2018 included $20 million ($0.02 per diluted share) of aftertax charges resulting from the Company’s Global Growth and Efficiency Program.\nNet income and Diluted earnings per share in first quarter 2017 were $570 million and $0.64, respectively. Net income in first quarter 2017 included $31 million ($0.03 per diluted share) of aftertax charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program.\nExcluding charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in both periods, Net income in first quarter 2018 was $654 million, an increase of 9% versus first quarter 2017, and Diluted earnings per share in first quarter 2018 was $0.74, an increase of 10% versus first quarter 2017.\nGross profit margin was 60.2% in first quarter 2018 versus 60.3% in first quarter 2017. Excluding charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in both periods, Gross profit margin was 60.3% in first quarter 2018, a decrease of 40 basis points versus the year ago quarter as higher raw and packaging material costs were partially offset by cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were 34.8% of Net sales in first quarter 2018 versus 35.5% of Net sales in first quarter 2017. Excluding charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in both periods, Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 30 basis points to 34.7% of Net sales in first quarter 2018 as a result of decreased advertising investment as a percentage of Net sales and lower overhead expenses as a percentage of Net sales. On an absolute basis, worldwide advertising investment increased 4% to $416 million versus $400 million in the year ago quarter.\nOperating profit increased to $983 million in first quarter 2018 compared to $912 million in first quarter 2017. Excluding charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in both periods, Operating profit was $1,007 million in first quarter 2018, an increase of 5% versus first quarter 2017. Operating profit margin was 24.6% in first quarter 2018 versus 24.2% in first quarter 2017. Excluding charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program in both periods, Operating profit margin was 25.2% in first quarter 2018, a decrease of 20 basis points versus the year ago quarter. This decrease in Operating profit margin was primarily due to a decrease in Gross profit, partially offset by a decrease in Selling, general and administrative expenses, both as a percentage of Net sales.\nNet cash provided by operations year to date decreased to $616 million compared to $691 million in the comparable 2017 period, primarily due to higher levels of working capital. Working capital as a percentage of Net sales was negative 2.7% compared to negative 4.3% in the year ago period.\nIan Cook, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the first quarter results, “The first quarter was a challenging one as category growth remained soft in many markets around the world. While net sales grew 6.5%, organic sales grew 1.5%, below our expectations, due to flat unit volume growth in emerging markets. In developed markets, unit volume grew 4.5% and organic volume grew 3.0%, led by strong volume growth in North America and Europe. Encouragingly, worldwide pricing improved sequentially versus fourth quarter 2017.\n“Advertising investment increased in absolute dollars versus first quarter 2017 and we continue to plan for increased advertising investment, both absolutely and as a percent to sales, for the full year in support of new products, our base businesses and longer-term consumption-building activities.\n“Operating profit, net income and diluted earnings per share all increased versus the year ago period.\n“Colgate’s leadership of the global toothpaste market continued during the quarter with our global market share at 42.4% year to date. Our global leadership in manual toothbrushes also continued with Colgate’s global market share in that category at 32.5% year to date.”\nMr. Cook continued, “As we look ahead, while uncertainty in global markets and category growth worldwide remain challenging, we are maintaining our heightened focus on brand building and increased productivity while accelerating our change efforts. Based on current spot rates, we expect a mid-single-digit net sales increase and low-single-digit organic sales growth in 2018, with sequential improvement in organic sales growth in the balance of the year.\n“On a GAAP basis, based on current spot rates and including the impact of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, we are planning for a year of gross margin expansion and expect double-digit earnings per share growth.\n“Excluding charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program and the one-time charge related to U.S. tax reform in 2017, based on current spot rates, we are planning for a year of increased operating cash flow, gross margin expansion, increased advertising investment and low-double-digit earnings per share growth.”\nAt 11:00 a.m. ET today, Colgate will host a conference call to elaborate on first quarter results. To access this call as a webcast, please go to Colgate’s website at http://www.colgatepalmolive.com .\nThe following are comments about divisional performance for first quarter 2018 versus the year ago period.

This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses and an increase in Other (income) expense, net, partially offset by an increase in Gross profit, all as a percentage of Net sales. This increase in Gross profit was primarily due to cost savings from the Company’s funding-the-growth initiatives, partially offset by higher raw and packaging material costs. This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to higher overhead expenses, partially offset by decreased advertising investment. This increase in Other (income) expense, net was due to the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the professional skin care acquisitions.\nIn the U.S., Colgate maintained its leadership in the toothpaste category during the quarter with its market share at 35.2% year to date.

CL-E\nEffective January 1, 2018, as required, the Company adopted ASU No. 2017-07, “Compensation-Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost,” on a retrospective basis. As a result, for all periods presented, only the service related component of pension and other postretirement benefit costs is included in Operating profit. The non-service related components (interest cost, expected return on assets and amortization of actuarial gains and losses) are included in a new line item, “Non-service related postretirement costs,” which is below Operating profit. Adoption of this standard had no effect on Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company, Earnings per common share or Cash flow. See Table 1A “Supplemental Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income Information,” Table 4A “Supplemental Segment Information” and Table 6A “Supplemental Non-GAAP Reconciliations Information” for reconciliations to previously reported amounts for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Refer to the Company’s website at http://www.colgatepalmolive.com for reconciliations to previously reported amounts for all quarters of 2017 as well as for years 2017 and 2016.\nMarket Share Information\nManagement uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. References to market share in this press release are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily Nielsen, and internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the Company competes and purchases data (excluding Venezuela from all periods). The Company measures year-to-date market shares from January 1 of the relevant year through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. The Company believes that the third-party vendors it uses to provide data are reliable, but it has not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. In addition, market share information calculated by the Company may be different from market share information calculated by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors.\nCautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release and the related webcast may contain forward-looking statements (as that term is defined in the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in its rules, regulations and releases) that set forth anticipated results based on management’s current plans and assumptions. Such statements may relate, for example, to sales or volume growth, organic sales growth, profit or profit margin growth, earnings per share growth (including on a currency-neutral basis), financial goals, the impact of foreign exchange volatility, cost-reduction plans including the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, tax rates, U.S. tax reform, the need to repatriate undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, new product introductions or commercial investment levels, acquisitions, divestitures, or legal or tax proceedings, among other matters. These statements are made on the basis of the Company’s views and assumptions as of this time and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the SEC. Moreover, the Company does not, nor does any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these statements. The Company cautions investors that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual events or results may differ materially from those statements. For more information about factors that could impact the Company’s business and cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, investors should refer to the Company’s filings with the SEC (including, but not limited to, the information set forth under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q). Copies of these filings may be obtained upon request from the Company’s Investor Relations Department or on the Company’s website at http://www.colgatepalmolive.com .\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe following provides information regarding the non-GAAP financial measures used in this earnings release and/or the related webcast:\nThis release discusses Net sales growth (GAAP) and organic sales growth, which is Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments (non-GAAP). Management believes the organic sales growth measure provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign exchange as well as the impact from acquisitions and divestments. See “Geographic Sales Analysis Percentage Changes” for the three months ended March 31, 2018 vs 2017 included with this release for a comparison of organic sales growth to Net sales growth in accordance with GAAP.\nTo supplement Colgate’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income presented in accordance with GAAP, the Company has disclosed non-GAAP measures of operating results that exclude certain items. Worldwide Gross profit, Gross profit margin, Selling, general and administrative expenses, Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of Net sales, Other (income) expense, net, Operating profit, Operating profit margin, Non-service related postretirement costs, Effective income tax rate, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Diluted earnings per common share are discussed both as reported (on a GAAP basis) and excluding charges resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program (non-GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that, either by their nature or amount, management would not expect to occur as part of the Company’s normal business on a regular basis, such as restructuring charges, charges for certain litigation and tax matters, gains and losses from certain divestitures and certain unusual, non-recurring items. Investors and analysts use these financial measures in assessing the Company’s business performance, and management believes that presenting these financial measures on a non-GAAP basis provides them with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company’s underlying business performance and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures also enhance the ability to compare period-to-period financial results. See “Non-GAAP Reconciliations” for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 included with this release for a reconciliation of these financial measures to the related GAAP measures.\nThe Company uses these financial measures internally in its budgeting process, to evaluate segment and overall operating performance and as factors in determining compensation. While the Company believes that these financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s underlying business performance and trends, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies.\nThe Company defines free cash flow before dividends as Net cash provided by operations less Capital expenditures. As management uses this measure to evaluate the Company’s ability to satisfy current and future obligations, repurchase stock, pay dividends and fund future business opportunities, the Company believes that it provides useful information to investors. Free cash flow before dividends is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since the Company has certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. Free cash flow before dividends is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. See “Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows” for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 for a comparison of free cash flow before dividends to Net cash provided by operations as reported in accordance with GAAP.\n(See attached tables for first quarter results.)\nTable 1 Colgate-Palmolive Company Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (Dollars in Millions Except Per Share Amounts) (Unaudited) 2018 2017* Net sales $ 4,002 $ 3,762 Cost of sales 1,594 1,493 Gross profit 2,408 2,269 Gross profit margin 60.2 % 60.3 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,392 1,336 Other (income) expense, net 33 21 Operating profit 983 912 Operating profit margin 24.6 % 24.2 % Non-service related postretirement costs 24 27 Interest (income) expense, net 35 23 Income before income taxes 924 862 Provision for income taxes 246 251 Effective tax rate 26.6 % 29.1 % Net income including noncontrolling interests 678 611 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 44 41 Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company $ 634 $ 570 Earnings per common share Basic $ 0.72 $ 0.64 Diluted $ 0.72 $ 0.64 Average common shares outstanding Basic 875.4 884.7 Diluted 879.9 891.0 *The Company adopted ASU No. 2017-07, “Compensation–Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost,” on January 1, 2018. The adoption of this standard resulted in the non-service related postretirement costs being presented separately in the income statement from the service cost component and the non-service related postretirement costs no longer being included in Operating profit. As this standard was applied retrospectively, as required, the Company reclassified certain amounts to a new line below Operating profit called Non-service related postretirement costs.

As this standard was applied retrospectively, as required, the Company reclassified the non-service components from Operating profit to a new line below Operating profit called Non-service related postretirement costs.
