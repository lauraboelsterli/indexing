    "text": "Science Warhol’s Elvis portrait could fetch $30 million at Christie’s sale Andy Warhol's full-length portrait of Elvis Presley, \"Double Elvis (Ferus Type),\" is projected to sell at around $30 million. The pop artist's only full-length portrait is being auctioned by Christie's in New York on May 17. Published 7 Hours Ago The Associated Press Kirsty Wigglesworth | AP A painting by Andy Warhol called 'Double Elvis (1963) is displayed at Christie's auction rooms in London, Thursday, April 5, 2018. \nAn Andy Warhol painting of Elvis Presley — the pop artist's only full-length portrait — is for sale with an estimated price tag of around $30 million. \n\"Double Elvis (Ferus Type)\" depicts the hip-swiveling musician holding a revolver, as he appeared in the 1960 movie Western \"Flaming Star.\" A ghostly duplicate image hovers in the background. \nThe 1963 black-on-silver portrait is being auctioned by Christie's in New York on May 17, alongside Warhol's \"Most Wanted Men No. 11, John Joseph H., Jr.\" \nOne of a series of mug shot images created by Warhol for the 1964 New York World's Fair, it's also expected to fetch \"in the region of $30 million,\" Christie's says. \nThe portraits are on display at Christie's London showroom from Friday until Tuesday. \nChristie's contemporary art chairman Alex Rotter said the paintings — of \"the King of Rock 'n' Roll and the career criminal\" — are \"very memorable and early examples of Warhol's profound understanding of fame.\" \nThe record for a Warhol work is $105 million paid for \"Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster)\" at a 2013 Sotheby's auction.
