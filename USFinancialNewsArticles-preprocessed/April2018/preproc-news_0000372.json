    "text": "April 3, 2018 / 1:55 PM / Updated 4 minutes ago Temenos takeover target Fidessa to consider two potential offers Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - British software firm Fidessa ( FDSA.L ), which has been in takeover talks with Swiss banking software supplier Temenos ( TEMN.S ), said on Tuesday it was approached by two undisclosed buyers. \nOne of the possible offers would give Fidessa shareholders 38.297 pounds per share, representing a 5 percent premium to Temenos’ cash offer of 1.4 billion pounds ($1.97 billion) or 36.467 pounds per share. \nThe latest offer would value Fidessa at 1.48 billion pounds, according to a Reuters calculation. The company did not disclose any details on the second offer. \nFidessa said it would put off the meetings on April 5 to approve Temenos’ offer to explore the possible new offers. \n“Discussions with the third parties are ongoing and there can be no certainty that a formal offer from either will be forthcoming or as to the terms of any such offer,” Fidessa said. \nShare in Fidessa, which have risen over 12.4 pct since Temenos’s offer on Feb. 21, were up 11.3 percent at 1300 GMT. \nTemenos shares fell 2.6 pct to 111.40 Swiss francs ($116.25). \n($1 = 0.7108 pounds)",
