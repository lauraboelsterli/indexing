    "text": "(Reuters) - Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) is planning to raise salaries for junior bankers by as much as 25 percent, and offer them quicker promotions, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter.\nFILE PHOTO: The Morgan Stanley logo is displayed at the post where it is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, NY, U.S., April 19, 2017. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo The 20 percent to 25 percent pay raise for investment-banking associates will be the first in almost four years, and may differ by region, Bloomberg reported.\nAnalysts will be promoted to associate in two years rather than three, the report said, citing a memo sent to staff.\n(This version of the story has been refiled to add source in headline)\nReporting By Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru\n ",
