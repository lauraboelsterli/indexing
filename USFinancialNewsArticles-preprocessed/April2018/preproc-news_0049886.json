    "text": "MIAMI LAKES, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- BankUnited, Inc. (the “Company”) (NYSE: BKU) today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported net income of $85.2 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, compared to $62.3 million, or $0.57 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nThe annualized return on average stockholders’ equity for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 11.28% compared to 10.08% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 while the annualized return on average assets was 1.14% compared to 0.91% for the same periods.\nRajinder Singh, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"This was a strong quarter from an earnings perspective, with reported EPS increasing 35% over the comparable quarter of the prior year and pre-tax income increasing by 23%. We remain encouraged by positive tailwinds from tax reform, a strong job market and economic growth.\"\nPerformance Highlights\nNet interest income increased by $17.2 million to $247.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from $230.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Interest income increased by $44.2 million, driven by increases in the average balances of loans and investment securities outstanding as well as increases in tax-equivalent yields on interest earning assets. Interest expense increased by $27.0 million, driven primarily by increases in average interest bearing deposits and an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities. The net interest margin, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.56% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 3.52% for the immediately preceding quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 3.70% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Significant factors contributing to the decline in the net interest margin from the comparable quarter of the prior year were (i) an increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities; (ii) the impact on tax equivalent yields of the reduction in the statutory federal income tax rate; and (iii) although yields on all categories of interest earning assets increased, non-covered loans and investment securities were added to the balance sheet at yields lower than the existing yield on earning assets. The effective income tax rate declined to 23.1% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from 30.8% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to the reduction in the statutory federal income tax rate. Total deposits increased by $361 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, to $22.2 billion. Growth in non-interest bearing demand deposits accounted for $270 million of this increase. Non-covered loans and leases, including equipment under operating lease, grew by $66 million during the quarter. Loan growth was impacted during the quarter by continued runoff of the New York multi-family portfolio and seasonality in the mortgage warehouse and commercial and industrial lines of business. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, under the terms of the share repurchase program authorized by its Board of Directors, the Company repurchased 1.2 million shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $48.6 million. Book value per common share grew to $28.57 at March 31, 2018 from $28.32 at December 31, 2017 while tangible book value per common share increased to $27.83 from $27.59 over the same period.\nCapital\nThe Company and its banking subsidiary continue to exceed all regulatory guidelines required to be considered well capitalized. The Company’s and BankUnited, N.A.'s regulatory capital ratios at March 31, 2018 were as follows:\nBankUnited, Inc. BankUnited, N.A. Tier 1 leverage 9.6% 10.2% Common Equity Tier 1 (\"CET1\") risk-based capital 13.0% 13.9% Tier 1 risk-based capital 13.0% 13.9% Total risk-based capital 13.7% 14.5% Loans and Leases\nLoans, including premiums, discounts and deferred fees and costs, totaled $21.5 billion at March 31, 2018 compared to $21.4 billion at December 31, 2017. Non-covered loans grew to $21.0 billion while covered loans declined to $479 million at March 31, 2018.\nThe Florida franchise contributed $55 million of net loan growth for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, while balances for the New York franchise declined by $139 million, due primarily to a $121 million decline in the multi-family category. The Company's national platforms, including our commercial lending subsidiaries, our mortgage warehouse lending operations, our small business finance unit and our 1-4 family residential loan portfolio, contributed $158 million of net loan growth for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, primarily driven by growth of $165 million in 1-4 family residential loans.\nAt March 31, 2018, the non-covered loan portfolio included $7.4 billion, $6.0 billion and $7.6 billion attributable to the Florida franchise, the New York franchise and the national platforms, respectively.\nA comparison of loan portfolio composition at the dates indicated follows:\nNon-Covered Loans Total Loans March 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nResidential and other consumer loans 20.6% 19.8% 22.3% 21.7% Multi-family 14.8% 15.4% 14.5% 15.0% Non-owner occupied commercial real estate 21.6% 21.5% 21.0% 21.0% Construction and land 1.4% 1.5% 1.4% 1.5% Owner occupied commercial real estate 9.6% 9.7% 9.4% 9.4% Commercial and industrial 19.7% 19.9% 19.3% 19.4% Commercial lending subsidiaries 12.3% 12.2% 12.1% 12.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% Asset Quality and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nFor the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded provisions for loan losses of $3.1 million and $12.1 million, respectively, substantially all of which related to non-covered loans. The provision related to taxi medallion loans totaled $2.8 million and $9.5 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe most significant factor impacting the decrease in the provision for loan losses related to non-covered loans for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017, was the decline in the provision related to taxi medallion loans. Other offsetting factors contributing to the decline included (i) a net increase in the relative impact on the provision of changes in quantitative and qualitative loss factors; (ii) a decrease in the provision related to specific reserves; and (iii) lower loan growth.\nNon-covered, non-performing loans totaled $192.8 million or 0.92% of total non-covered loans at March 31, 2018, compared to $172.0 million or 0.82% of total non-covered loans at December 31, 2017. Non-performing taxi medallion loans comprised $98.4 million or 0.47% of total non-covered loans at March 31, 2018 and $106.1 million or 0.51% of total non-covered loans at December 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the entire taxi medallion portfolio was on non-accrual status.\nThe ratios of the allowance for non-covered loan and lease losses to total non-covered loans and to non-performing, non-covered loans were 0.65% and 71.03%, respectively, at March 31, 2018, compared to 0.69% and 84.03%, at December 31, 2017. The decrease in the ratio of the allowance for non-covered loan and lease losses to non-performing, non-covered loans was primarily a result of the increase in non-accrual multi-family loans during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and charge-offs related to taxi medallion loans. The annualized ratio of net charge-offs to average non-covered loans was 0.21% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 0.30% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The annualized ratio of charge-offs of taxi medallion loans to average non-covered loans was 0.10% and 0.13% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 ACI\nLoans Non-ACI\nLoans Non-Covered\nLoans Total ACI\nLoans Non-ACI\nLoans Non-Covered\nLoans Total Balance at beginning of period $ — $ 258 $ 144,537 $ 144,795 $ — $ 2,100 $ 150,853 $ 152,953 Provision (recovery) — 273 2,874 3,147 831 (52 ) 11,321 12,100 Charge-offs — (15 ) (10,617 ) (10,632 ) — (55 ) (14,769 ) (14,824 ) Recoveries — 2 164 166 — 65 987 1,052 Balance at end of period $ — $ 518 $ 136,958 $ 137,476 $ 831 $ 2,058 $ 148,392 $ 151,281 Charge-offs related to taxi medallion loans totaled $5.4 million and $5.9 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nDeposits\nAt March 31, 2018, deposits totaled $22.2 billion compared to $21.9 billion at December 31, 2017. The average cost of total deposits was 1.04% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to 0.94% for the immediately preceding quarter ended December 31, 2017, and 0.72% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nNet interest income\nNet interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased to $247.8 million from $230.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Increases in interest income were partially offset by increases in interest expense. The increases in interest income were primarily attributable to increases in the average balances of loans and investment securities and related average yields. Interest expense increased due to an increase in average interest bearing deposits and an increase in the cost of funds.\nThe Company’s net interest margin, calculated on a tax-equivalent basis, was 3.56% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to 3.52% for the immediately preceding quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 3.70% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nSignificant offsetting factors impacting the decrease in net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to three months ended March 31, 2017, included:\nThe tax-equivalent yield on loans increased to 5.26% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from 5.07% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, reflecting increased yields on both non-covered and covered loans. The tax-equivalent yield on non-covered loans was 3.83% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 3.62% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The most significant factor contributing to the increased yield on non-covered loans was the impact of increases in benchmark interest rates. The tax-equivalent yield on covered loans increased to 65.22% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from 49.83% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The tax-equivalent yield on investment securities increased to 3.04% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from 3.01% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Tax-equivalent yields on non-covered loans and investment securities were reduced by approximately 0.08% and 0.10%, respectively, and the net interest margin was reduced by approximately 0.08% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 due to the reduction of the statutory federal income tax rate. Growth of non-covered loans and investment securities at yields lower than the overall yield on interest earning assets. The average rate on interest bearing liabilities increased to 1.37% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from 0.98% for three months ended March 31, 2017, reflecting higher average rates on both interest bearing deposits and FHLB advances. Increases in the cost of interest bearing liabilities primarily reflect increases in market interest rates and extension of the duration of FHLB advances.\nThe Company’s net interest margin continues to be impacted by reclassifications from non-accretable difference to accretable yield on ACI loans. Non-accretable difference at acquisition represented the difference between the total contractual payments due and the cash flows expected to be received on these loans. The accretable yield on ACI loans represented the amount by which undiscounted expected future cash flows exceeded the recorded investment in the loans. As the Company’s expected cash flows from ACI loans have increased since the FSB Acquisition, the Company has reclassified amounts from non-accretable difference to accretable yield.\nChanges in accretable yield on ACI loans for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2017 were as follows (in thousands):\nBalance, December 31, 2016 $ 675,385 Reclassifications from non-accretable difference, net 81,501 Accretion (301,827 ) Balance, December 31, 2017 455,059 Reclassifications from non-accretable difference, net 41,739 Accretion (82,301 ) Balance, March 31, 2018 $ 414,497 Non-interest income\nNon-interest income totaled $28.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $28.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nNon-interest expense\nNon-interest expense totaled $161.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $156.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The most significant components of the $5.3 million increase for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017 were (i) an increase in employee compensation and benefits of $7.4 million mainly attributable to an increase in the number of employees, offset by (ii) a decrease in amortization of the FDIC indemnification asset of $4.1 million.\nAmortization of the FDIC indemnification asset was $40.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $44.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The amortization rate increased to 58.42% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from 36.38% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. As the expected cash flows from ACI loans have increased, expected cash flows from the FDIC indemnification asset have decreased, resulting in continued increases in the amortization rate. Although the amortization rate increased, total amortization expense declined due to the reduction in the average balance of the indemnification asset.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe effective income tax rate was 23.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 30.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to the reduction of the statutory corporate federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTangible book value per common share is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes this measure is relevant to understanding the capital position and performance of the Company. Disclosure of this non-GAAP financial measure also provides a meaningful base for comparison to other financial institutions. The following table reconciles the non-GAAP financial measurement of tangible book value per common share to the comparable GAAP financial measurement of book value per common share at March 31, 2018 (in thousands except share and per share data):\nTotal stockholders’ equity $ 3,032,672 Less: goodwill and other intangible assets 77,751 Tangible stockholders’ equity $ 2,954,921 Common shares issued and outstanding 106,160,751 Book value per common share $ 28.57 Tangible book value per common share $ 27.83 Earnings Conference Call and Presentation\nA conference call to discuss quarterly results will be held at 9:00 a.m. ET on Wednesday, April 25, 2018 with President and Chief Executive Officer, Rajinder P.

Concurrently with the FSB Acquisition, BankUnited entered into two loss sharing agreements, or the Loss Sharing Agreements, which covered certain legacy assets, including the entire legacy loan portfolio and OREO, and certain purchased investment securities. Assets covered by the Loss Sharing Agreements are referred to as “covered assets” (or, in certain cases, “covered loans”). The Loss Sharing Agreements do not apply to subsequently purchased or originated loans or other assets. Effective May 22, 2014 and consistent with the terms of the Loss Sharing Agreements, loss share coverage was terminated for those commercial loans and OREO and certain investment securities that were previously covered under the Loss Sharing Agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the Loss Sharing Agreements, the covered assets are subject to a stated loss threshold whereby the FDIC will reimburse BankUnited for 80% of losses, including certain interest and expenses, up to the $4.0 billion stated threshold and 95% of losses in excess of the $4.0 billion stated threshold. The Company’s current estimate of cumulative losses on the covered assets is approximately $3.6 billion. The Company has received $2.7 billion from the FDIC in reimbursements under the Loss Sharing Agreements for claims filed for incurred losses as of March 31, 2018.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that reflect the Company’s current views with respect to, among other things, future events and financial performance.\nThe Company generally identifies forward-looking statements by terminology such as “outlook,” “believes,” “expects,” “potential,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “could,” “should,” “seeks,” “approximately,” “predicts,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “anticipates” or the negative version of those words or other comparable words.
