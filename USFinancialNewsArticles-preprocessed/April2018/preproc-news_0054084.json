    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning,\nHistoric Step South We can all agree that these are unusual times. Kim Jong Un became the first North Korean leader to set foot in the South since the Korean War when he stepped across the military demarcation line Friday and shook hands with Moon Jae-in, the South Korean president. The two leaders agreed to pursue a peace agreement following historic talks, but largely steered clear of specifics on the question of Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons, leaving uncertainties about the regime’s willingness to cede ground on its arsenal ahead of a planned summit between Mr. Kim and President Trump . After an 8½-hour meeting at the demilitarized zone , the leaders agreed to take steps to dial down tensions and start talks with the U.S., and perhaps China, with a view to declaring within the year a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War. The conflict ended in an armistice that has held, despite occasional cross-border skirmishes, for 65 years. A joint statement also calls for a resumption of reunions of families separated by the war, and the establishment of an inter-Korean liaison office on the northern side of the DMZ. As part of the agreement, Mr. Moon will travel to Pyongyang in the fall for a summit meeting.\nPrime Advantage Investors have come to expect big things from Amazon. Profits haven’t always been among them. But that is quickly changing . Amazon delivered a double punch, reporting its best revenue growth in more than six years on Thursday while topping $1 billion in profit for the second straight quarter. The e-commerce giant is steadily making more of its money from businesses that are more profitable than shipping boxes of goods to consumers. Chief among those is its AWS cloud unit, which generated $5.4 billion in revenue during the quarter. Amazon also said it would raise the annual price of its Prime membership program 20% to $119, a sizable leap that could deliver meaningful revenue but also comes amid a sharp jump in fuel prices, the Journal’s Laura Stevens writes .\nBanking Trouble The Journal reports that the Labor Department is examining whether Wells Fargo has been pushing participants in low-cost corporate 401(k) plans to roll their holdings into more expensive individual retirement accounts at the bank. Labor Department investigators also are interested in whether Wells Fargo’s retirement-plan services unit pressed account holders to buy in-house funds, generating more revenue to the bank. At issue in the Labor Department’s investigation is how Wells Fargo handles its clients’ retirement savings. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, entities that serve these accounts are supposed to put their clients’ interests ahead of their own. A new federal investigation is unwelcome news for Wells Fargo, which has been dealing with an array of regulatory issues over the past two years.\nDraft Issues The clearest way to grasp the craziness of this NFL draft is by looking at the player who went No. 1 overall: Baker Mayfield. The Cleveland Browns tapped him as the first pick and the hope that he could—finally—turn their franchise around. That was the beginning of the mania. At No. 2 the New York Giants did something considered crazy by many. They didn’t take a quarterback. Instead, they took Saquon Barkley, a dynamic running back from Penn State. He became the first running back to go this high since Reggie Bush in 2006. Four quarterbacks were taken in the top-10 for the first time ever. Drew Hawkins, head of Morgan Stanley’s Global Sports & Entertainment practice, breaks down the best financial strategy for future NFL stars to follow after receiving a multimillion-dollar NFL deal.\nToday’s Video A Brief History of the Music Industry From the invention of the phonograph in 1877 to the boom in streaming services today, the music industry has had to constantly adapt to emerging technology.

Please include your name and location.\n—Compiled by Jessica Menton\nReader Response Responding to yesterday’s question on Facebook’s attempt to tackle its user-data crisis , Bob Jones of New Jersey shared: “It hardly seems like a crisis since they continue to sign up new users and earn record profits. Consumers seem far less concerned than Congress.” Jay Davidson of Quote: : “As evidenced by the performance of the stock and the number of new members, Facebook doesn’t have a user-data problem. However, they will have a federal-regulation problem soon.” And Bruno Momont of New York weighed in: “I certainly hope that the increase in Facebook users over a period steeped in data-privacy controversies isn’t interpreted by lawmakers to mean that no new regulation is required.”\nThis daily briefing is named “The 10-Point” after the nickname conferred by the editors of The Wall Street Journal on the lead column of the legendary “What’s News” digest of top stories.
