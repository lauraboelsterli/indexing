Net interest income in the first quarter 2018 includes $5.7 million of total accretion income from acquired loans, compared to $7.1 million in the fourth quarter 2017, and $6.4 million in the first quarter 2017.\nThe Company’s net interest margin in the first quarter 2018 was 4.60%, a decrease from 4.73% in the fourth quarter 2017, and from 4.63% in the first quarter 2017. However, adjusting net interest margin to exclude the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"), which reduced the tax equivalent adjustment from tax-exempt securities and loans, would result in net interest margin of 4.72% for the first quarter 2018.\nOperating non-interest income was $12.7 million for the first quarter 2018, compared to $12.3 million for the fourth quarter 2017, and $10.0 million for the first quarter 2017. 1 The increase in operating non-interest income for the first quarter 2018, compared to the same quarter in the prior year is a result of an increase in service charges and fees of $1.0 million and an increase of $0.8 million in warrant income.\nNet operating revenue was $226.9 million for the first quarter 2018, an increase of $3.7 million, compared to $223.3 million for the fourth quarter 2017, and an increase of $37.7 million or 19.9%, compared to $189.3 million for the first quarter 2017. 1\nOperating non-interest expense was $99.4 million for the first quarter 2018, compared to $95.4 million for the fourth quarter 2017, and $88.4 million for the first quarter 2017. 1 The Company’s operating efficiency ratio 1 on a tax equivalent basis was 42.7% for the first quarter 2018, compared to 40.7% for the fourth quarter 2017, and 44.4% for the first quarter 2017. The decrease in the tax equivalent adjustment was the primary driver of the change in the operating efficiency ratio from the fourth quarter 2017. Adjusting the operating efficiency ratio to exclude the effects of the lower statutory corporate federal tax rate would result in an operating efficiency ratio of 41.7% for the first quarter 2018.\nIncome tax expense was $20.8 million for the first quarter 2018, compared to $35.0 million for the fourth quarter 2017, and $24.5 million for the first quarter 2017. Income tax expense for the first quarter 2018 includes the effect of the TCJA, which lowered the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, as well as the cyclical excess tax benefits on share-based payment awards.\nNet income was $100.9 million for the first quarter 2018, an increase of $11.6 million from $89.3 million for the fourth quarter 2017, and an increase of $27.6 million or 37.6%, from $73.3 million for the first quarter 2017. Earnings per share was $0.96 for the first quarter 2018, compared to $0.85 for the fourth quarter 2017, and $0.70 for the first quarter 2017.\nThe Company views its operating pre-provision net revenue (\"PPNR\") as a key metric for assessing the Company’s earnings power, which it defines as net operating revenue less operating non-interest expense. For the first quarter 2018, the Company’s operating PPNR was $127.6 million, down from $127.8 million in the fourth quarter 2017, and up 26.4% from $100.9 million in the first quarter 2017. 1 The non-operating items 1 for the first quarter 2018 consisted primarily of a net gain on sales and valuations of repossessed and other assets of $1.2 million, offset by net unrealized losses on assets measured at fair value of $1.1 million.\nThe Company had 1,713 full-time equivalent employees and 47 offices at March 31, 2018, compared to 1,725 employees and 47 offices at December 31, 2017, and 1,560 employees and 48 offices at March 31, 2017.\nBalance Sheet\nGross loans totaled $15.56 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $466 million from $15.09 billion at December 31, 2017, and an increase of $1.90 billion from $13.66 billion at March 31, 2017. The increase from the prior quarter was driven by an increase of $325 million in construction and land development loans and $103 million in commercial and industrial loans. From March 31, 2017, loans increased across all loan types, with the largest increase in commercial and industrial loans of $905 million. At March 31, 2018, the allowance for credit losses to gross loans held for investment was 0.93%, compared to 0.93% at December 31, 2017, and 0.94% at March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, the allowance for credit losses to total organic loans was 1.02%, compared to 1.03% at December 31, 2017, and 1.08% at March 31, 2017. The Company defines its organic loans as those loans that have not been acquired in a transaction accounted for as a business combination.\nConsistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), the allowance for credit losses is not carried over in an acquisition because acquired loans are recorded at fair value, which discounts the loans based on expected future cash flows. Credit discounts on acquired loans are included as a reduction to gross loans. These discounts totaled $23.1 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $27.0 million at December 31, 2017, and $45.1 million at March 31, 2017.\nDeposits totaled $17.35 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $382 million from $16.97 billion at December 31, 2017, and an increase of $2.00 billion from $15.36 billion at March 31, 2017. The increase from both the prior quarter and from March 31, 2017 is the result of organic deposit growth. Non-interest bearing deposits were $7.50 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $7.43 billion at December 31, 2017, and $6.11 billion at March 31, 2017. Non-interest bearing deposits comprised 43.2% of total deposits at March 31, 2018, compared to 43.8% at December 31, 2017, and 39.8% at March 31, 2017. The proportion of savings and money market balances to total deposits was 36.4%, compared to 37.3% at December 31, 2017, and 40.7% at March 31, 2017. Certificates of deposit as a percentage of total deposits were 10.1% at March 31, 2018, compared to 9.6% at December 31, 2017, and 10.0% at March 31, 2017. The Company’s ratio of loans to deposits was 89.7% at March 31, 2018, compared to 88.9% at December 31, 2017, and 89.0% at March 31, 2017.\nBorrowings totaled $300 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $90 million from $390 million at December 31, 2017, and an increase of $300 million from zero at March 31, 2017. The change in borrowings from both the prior quarter and the prior year is due to fluctuations in FHLB overnight advances.\nQualifying debt totaled $364 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $377 million at December 31, 2017, and $367 million at March 31, 2017.\nStockholders’ equity at March 31, 2018 was $2.29 billion, compared to $2.23 billion at December 31, 2017, and $1.97 billion at March 31, 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, tangible common equity, net of tax, was 9.8% of tangible assets 1 and total capital was 13.2% of risk-weighted assets. The Company’s tangible book value per share 1 was $18.86 at March 31, 2018, up 18.9% from March 31, 2017.\nTotal assets increased 2.1% to $20.76 billion at March 31, 2018, from $20.33 billion at December 31, 2017, and increased 14.6% from $18.12 billion at March 31, 2017. The increase in total assets from the prior year relates primarily to organic loan growth and an increase in investment securities resulting from utilized cash from increased deposits.\nAsset Quality\nThe provision for credit losses was $6.0 million for the first quarter 2018, compared to $5.0 million for the fourth quarter 2017, and compared to $4.3 million for the first quarter 2017. Net loan charge-offs (recoveries) in the first quarter 2018 were $1.4 million, or 0.04% of average loans (annualized), consistent with $1.4 million, or 0.04%, in the fourth quarter 2017, and $1.3 million, or 0.04%, in the first quarter 2017.\nNonaccrual loans decreased $6.6 million to $37.3 million during the quarter and increased $2.8 million during past twelve months. Loans past due 90 days and still accruing interest totaled $37 thousand at March 31, 2018, compared to $43 thousand at December 31, 2017, and $3.7 million at March 31, 2017. Loans past due 30-89 days and still accruing interest totaled $6.5 million at quarter end, a decrease from $10.1 million at December 31, 2017, and a decrease from $10.8 million at March 31, 2017.\nRepossessed assets totaled $30.2 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of $1.7 million from $28.5 million at December 31, 2017, and a decrease of $15.0 million from $45.2 million at March 31, 2017. Adversely graded loans and non-performing assets totaled $378.7 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of $23.6 million from $355.2 million at December 31, 2017, and a decrease of $9.5 million from $388.2 million at March 31, 2017.\nAs the Company’s capital increased, the ratio of classified assets to Tier I capital plus the allowance for credit losses, a common regulatory measure of asset quality, was 9.4% at March 31, 2018, compared to 10.3% at December 31, 2017, and 12.6% at March 31, 2017. 1\n1 See reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\nSegment Highlights\nThe Company's reportable segments are aggregated primarily based on geographic location, services offered, and markets served. The Company's regional segments, which include, Arizona, Nevada, Southern California, and Northern California provide full service banking and related services to their respective markets. The operations from the regional segments correspond to the following banking divisions: Alliance Bank of Arizona, Bank of Nevada and First Independent Bank, Torrey Pines Bank, and Bridge Bank.\nThe Company's National Business Lines (\"NBL\") segment provides specialized banking services to niche markets. The Company's NBL reportable segments include Homeowner Associations (\"HOA\") Services, Hotel Franchise Finance (\"HFF\") Public & Nonprofit Finance, Technology & Innovation, and Other NBLs. These NBLs are managed centrally and are broader in geographic scope than our other segments, though still predominately located within our core market areas. The HOA Services NBL corresponds to the Alliance Association Bank division. The HFF NBL includes the hotel franchise loan portfolio purchased from GE Capital on April 20, 2016. The operations of Public and Nonprofit Finance are combined into one reportable segment. The Technology & Innovation NBL includes the operations of Equity Fund Resources, the Life Sciences Group, the Renewable Resource Group, and Technology Finance. The Other NBLs segment consists of the operations of Corporate Finance, Mortgage Warehouse Lending, and Resort Finance.\nThe Corporate & Other segment consists of corporate-related items, income and expense items not allocated to our other reportable segments, and inter-segment eliminations.\nKey management metrics for evaluating the performance of the Company's Arizona, Nevada, Southern California, Northern California, and NBL segments include loan and deposit growth, asset quality, and pre-tax income.\nThe regional segments reported gross loan balances of $8.58 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $199 million during the quarter, and an increase of $831 million during the last twelve months. The growth in loans during the quarter was primarily driven by increases of $149 million in Arizona and $79 million in Southern California. The loan growth during the quarter was partially offset by a decrease of $25 million in Nevada. The growth in loans during the last twelve months was primarily driven by increases of $433 million in Arizona, $207 million in Southern California, and $141 million in Northern California. Total deposits for the regional segments were $12.91 billion, a decrease of $29 million during the quarter, and an increase of $897 million during the last twelve months. During the quarter, Nevada and Southern California had decreases in deposits of $303 million and $37 million, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $179 million and $133 million in Arizona and Northern California, respectively. During the last twelve months, Arizona, Northern California, and Southern California had increased deposits of $766 million, $353 million, and $27 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in deposits of $248 million in Nevada.\nPre-tax income for the regional segments was $85.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $2.4 million from the three months ended December 31, 2017, and an increase of $13.4 million from the three months ended March 31, 2017. Nevada and Arizona had the largest increases in pre-tax income of $4.4 million and $0.8 million, respectively, compared to the three months ended December 31, 2017. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.2 million in Northern California. Arizona, Nevada, and Southern California had increases in pre-tax income from the three months ended March 31, 2017 of $6.6 million, $5.9 million, and $1.3 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.4 million in Northern California.\nThe NBL segments reported gross loan balances of $6.98 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $269 million during the quarter, and an increase of $1.07 billion during the last twelve months. The increase in loans for the NBL segments compared to the prior quarter relates primarily to the Other NBLs, Technology & Innovation, and HFF segments, which increased by $182 million, $71 million, $51 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $41 million in the Public & Nonprofit Finance segment. During the last twelve months, each of the NBL segments have had increases in loans. The largest drivers of the increase were the Other NBLs, Technology & Innovation, and HFF segments, with increases of $770 million, $158 million, and $99 million, respectively. Total deposits for the NBL segments were $4.21 billion, an increase of $241 million during the quarter, and an increase of $954 million during the last twelve months. The HOA Services segment increased deposits during the quarter of $245 million, while the Technology & Innovation segment remained relatively unchanged. The increase of $954 million during the last twelve months is the result of growth in the Technology & Innovation and HOA Services of $591 million and $363 million, respectively.\nPre-tax income for the NBL segments was $46.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, a decrease of $4.1 million from the three months ended December 31, 2017, and an increase of $9.2 million from the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in pre-tax income from the prior quarter relates primarily to the Public & Nonprofit and Other NBLs segments, which decreased by $3.3 million and $2.1 million, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in pre-tax income from the Technology & Innovation segment of $0.8 million. The primary drivers of the increase in pre-tax income from the same period in the prior year were the Other NBLs, Technology & Innovation, and HOA Services segments. These segments had increases of $5.5 million, $3.4 million, and $2.0 million, respectively. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $1.9 million in pre-tax income in the Public & Nonprofit segment.\nConference Call and Webcast\nWestern Alliance Bancorporation will host a conference call and live webcast to discuss its first quarter 2018 financial results at 12:00 p.m. ET on Friday, April 20, 2018. Participants may access the call by dialing 1-888-317-6003 and using passcode 1123074 or via live audio webcast using the website link https://services.choruscall.com/links/wal180420.html . The webcast is also available via the Company’s website at www.westernalliancebancorporation.com . Participants should log in at least 15 minutes early to receive instructions. The call will be recorded and made available for replay after 2:00 p.m. ET April 20th through 9:00 a.m. ET May 20th by dialing 1-877-344-7529 passcode: 10118783.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts in the Consolidated Income Statements for the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. The reclassifications have no effect on net income or stockholders’ equity as previously reported.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThis press release contains both financial measures based on GAAP and non-GAAP based financial measures, which are used where management believes them to be helpful in understanding the Company’s results of operations or financial position. Where non-GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure, can be found in this press release. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.\nAdoption of Accounting Standards\nDuring the first quarter 2018, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities and ASU 2018-02, Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.\nThe amendments in ASU 2014-09 create a common revenue standard and clarify the principles for recognizing revenue that can be applied consistently across various transactions, industries, and capital markets. Although this new accounting guidance brings considerable changes to how many companies account for revenue and disclose revenue-related information, the effect on the Company has not been significant as substantially all of the Company's revenue is generated from interest income related to loans and investment securities, which are not within the scope of this guidance. For the Company's revenue streams that are within the scope of this guidance, the guidance was adopted on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. Upon adoption, the Company's accounting policies did not change materially as the principles of revenue recognition in the ASU are largely consistent with current practices applied by the Company.\nThe amendments in ASU 2016-01 require that equity investments be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, rather than accumulated other comprehensive income. Upon adoption of the new accounting guidance, on January 1, 2018, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment of $0.4 million to decrease accumulated other comprehensive income with a corresponding increase to opening retained earnings. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recognized a loss of $1.1 million related to fair value changes in equity securities.\nThe amendments in ASU 2018-02 allow a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings from tax effects resulting from the TCJA so that tax effects of items within other comprehensive income reflect the current tax rate. Previously, the effect of a change in tax laws or rates on deferred tax liabilities and assets were included in income from continuing operations even in situations in which the related income tax effects of items in accumulated other comprehensive income were originally recognized in comprehensive income. Upon adoption of the new accounting guidance, on January 1, 2018, the Company recorded a cumulative-effect adjustment of $0.6 million to decrease accumulated other comprehensive income with a corresponding increase to opening retained earnings.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis release contains forward-looking statements that relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.

cash generating capacity of the Company. (2) We believe this non-GAAP measurement is a key indicator of the earnings power of the Company. (3) We believe this non-GAAP ratio provides an important metric with which to analyze and evaluate financial condition and capital strength. (4) We believe this non-GAAP measurement improves the comparability to other institutions that have not engaged in acquisitions that resulted in recorded goodwill and other intangibles. (5) We believe this non-GAAP ratio provides a useful metric to measure the operating efficiency of the Company. (6) Under the current guidelines of the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, common equity Tier 1 capital consists of common stock, retained earnings, and minority interests in certain subsidiaries, less most other intangible assets. (7) Common equity Tier 1 is often expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. Under the risk-based capital framework, a bank's balance sheet assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of the risk categories defined under new capital guidelines. The aggregated dollar amount in each category is then multiplied by the risk weighting assigned to that category. The resulting weighted values from each category are added together and this sum is the risk-weighted assets total that, as adjusted, comprises the denominator (risk-weighted assets) of the common equity Tier 1 ratio. Common equity Tier 1 is divided by the risk-weighted assets to determine the common equity Tier 1 ratio. We believe this non-GAAP ratio provides an important metric with which to analyze and evaluate financial condition and capital strength. (8) We believe this non-GAAP ratio provides an important regulatory metric to analyze asset quality.
