    "text": "April 2, 2018 / 2:12 PM / Updated 6 minutes ago Winnie Mandela, tainted anti-apartheid figurehead, dies at 81 Dinky Mkhize 4 Min Read \nSOWETO, South Africa (Reuters) - Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, who emerged as a combative anti-apartheid campaigner during her husband Nelson Mandela’s decades in jail but whose reputation was later tarnished by allegations of violence, died on Monday at the age of 81. \nMadikizela-Mandela died peacefully surrounded by her family following a long illness that kept her in and out of hospital since the start of the year, family spokesman Victor Dlamini said in a statement. \n“She fought valiantly against the apartheid state and sacrificed her life for the freedom of the country,” he said. \n“She kept the memory of her imprisoned husband Nelson Mandela alive during his years on Robben Island and helped give the struggle for justice in South Africa one its most recognisable faces.” \nThe nature of her illness was not disclosed. \nA crowd of around 200 people soon gathered outside her Soweto home, singing and dancing. A number of national and local politicians arrived and police closed the street to traffic. \nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa led an outpouring of grief over her death in South Africa.

REUTERS/Mike Hutchings/Files TIRELESS CAMPAIGNER \nBorn on Sept. 26, 1936, in Bizana, Eastern Cape province, Madikizela-Mandela became politicised at an early age in her job as a hospital social worker. \nThe 22-year-old Winnie caught the eye of Mandela at a Soweto bus-stop in 1957, starting a whirlwind romance that led to their marriage a year later. \nAfter Nelson Mandela was jailed for life in 1964 for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government, Madikizela-Mandela campaigned tirelessly for his release and emerged as a prominent anti-apartheid figure in her own right, undergoing detention, banishment and arrest. \nShe punched the air in the clenched-fist salute of black power as she walked hand-in-hand with Mandela out of Victor Verster prison, near Cape Town, on Feb. 11, 1990. \nFor husband and wife, it was a crowning moment that led four years later to the end of centuries of white domination when Mandela became South Africa’s first black president. \nBut their marriage began to fall apart in the years after his release. The couple divorced in 1996, nearly four decades after they were married. They had two children together. \nThe end of apartheid marked the start of a string of legal and political troubles for Madikizela-Mandela.

Her six-year jail term was reduced on appeal to a fine. Writing by Tanisha Heiberg and Joe Brock; editing by John Stonestreet and Adrian Croft",
