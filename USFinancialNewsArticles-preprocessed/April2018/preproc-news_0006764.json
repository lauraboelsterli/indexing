    "text": "Inclement weather led to the postponement of the Cincinnati Reds’ scheduled home game against the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday.\nThe clubs waited nearly an hour and a half after the scheduled start time before the decision was made to call the game. The contest will be made us as part of a day-night doubleheader on May 19 at Great American Ball Park.\nThe Reds also had their season opener against the Washington Nationals postponed last Thursday.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
