    "text": "LONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - The buck stops with Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg when it comes to the fallout from a recent data scandal that has impacted millions of users, the firm’s chief technology officer told UK lawmakers.\n“The buck stops with Mark,” Mike Schroepfer told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, adding “I don’t know” when asked whether Zuckerberg would answer the lawmakers’ questions.\nCommittee chairman Damian Collins said he would renew his request for Zuckerberg to give evidence to Britain’s parliament.
