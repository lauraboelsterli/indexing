    "text": "2 COMMENTS Facing the added challenge of dealing with legacy information-technology systems, many older firms worry about losing ground in the race to tap artificial intelligence, blockchain and other emerging IT tools.\nJust over half of senior-level decision makers at companies in business for 30 years or more say they “feel outdated” in the digital era, compared to 40% of officials at younger firms, according to a survey by IT consulting and developing firm PointSource.\nThe survey polled 679 senior officials at U.S.-based businesses in a range of industries, roughly a quarter with more than $500 million in annual revenue and 15% with more than $1 billion.\nNearly 40% of the businesses surveyed are more than 30 years old.\nAll told, 90% of all survey respondents said digital technologies play a “central role” in their business goals, while 94% said they have boosted their focus on shifting to digital capabilities in the past year alone.\nThat aligns with recent IT spending forecasts. Gartner last week projected worldwide IT spending this year would reach $3.7 trillion , a 6.2% increase over 2017. The gains are being driven by corporate spending on digital transformation efforts, Gartner said.\nYet, for many older firms, that process comes with added headaches, according to the PointSource survey.\nOn a daily basis, it found, older firms are far more likely to waste take longer tracking down and sharing data, or other digital assets, across their organization – as a result of insufficient or incompatible technologies, or a lack of staff training in the latest tools.\nOlder firms are also more likely to be wrestling with aging and often highly-customized IT systems that predate cloud-era capabilities, an issue not faced by younger, cloud-native competitors.\nTyson Food Inc. recently told CIO Journal about ongoing efforts to consolidate disparate IT systems and deploy new technologies, which the 83-year-old meat producer hopes will enable it to move faster, better predict demand and spur innovation.\nLikewise, Patrick Benson, CIO of golf and country club operator ClubCorp Holdings Inc., founded in 1957, told CIO Journal in February that legacy IT systems at different clubs across the country caused lengthy delays in modernization efforts, including some with membership data stored on paper forms.\nShare this: CLOUD IT IMPLEMENTATION LEGACY APPLICATIONS Previous The Morning Download: You Can Keep Your Data Next The Morning Download: Defense Department's Massive Cloud Contract Creates a Storm",
