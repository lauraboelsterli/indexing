    "text": " 06 PM / Updated 9 minutes ago Tokyo prosecutors probe Kobe Steel's data tampering - Nikkei Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Japanese prosecutors on Tuesday decided to work with Tokyo police on a joint probe relating to a data tampering scandal at Kobe Steel Ltd ( 5406.T ), the Nikkei business daily reported, citing a source familiar with the matter. FILE PHOTO: Kobe Steel's logo is seen through a fence at a facility of Kakogawa Works in Kakogawa, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan, November 13, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo \nProsecutors have already subpoenaed documents from Kobe, Japanâ€™s third-largest steelmaker, Nikkei reported. \nThe company admitted last year to supplying products with falsified specifications to about 500 customers, throwing global supply chains into turmoil. \nKobe said it had sold products that met safety and other standards but did not fulfil contract specifications agreed with customers. \nKobe could not immediately be reached for comment.
