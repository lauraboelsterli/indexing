It hit at 5:11 a.m. (4.11 a.m. BST). \nThe mayor of the town of Pieve Torina, which was hit hard by the 2016 quake, reported that Tuesdayâ€™s tremor had caused some damage. He said schools had been ordered close. \nTrain service in parts of the area was suspended to check for possible damage to tracks. \nThe 2016 quake, which was of magnitude 6.2, killed nearly 300 people and razed villages.
