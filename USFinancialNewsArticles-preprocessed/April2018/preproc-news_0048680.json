    "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala., April 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nNational Commerce Corporation (Nasdaq:NCOM) (“NCC” or the “Company”), the parent company of National Bank of Commerce (“NBC”), today reported first quarter 2018 net income to common shareholders of $9.1 million, compared to $5.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. Diluted net earnings per share were $0.52 in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.45 in the first quarter of 2017.\n“We are pleased with our first quarter performance, which provides us with a good start to 2018,” said Richard Murray, IV, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “Our first quarter loan and deposit growth was somewhat muted compared to our very strong fourth quarter 2017 growth, consistent with our prior growth history and some degree of seasonality. We look forward to the remainder of the year.”\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company successfully completed its acquisition of FirstAtlantic Financial Holdings, Inc. (“FirstAtlantic”) through a merger of the companies, followed by the merger of their respective bank subsidiaries, FirstAtlantic Bank and NBC. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company recognized $2.4 million in merger-related expenses ($1.8 million after-tax), reducing diluted net earnings per share by $0.10.\nSeveral important measures from the first quarter of 2018 are as follows:\nNet Interest Margin (taxable equivalent) of 4.80% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 4.63% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 4.18% for the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter 2018 margin increased 0.17% compared to the 2017 fourth quarter due primarily to higher loan yields, which were driven by higher accretion income and an increase in interest rates during the first quarter of 2018. If accretion is excluded from both periods, the 2018 first quarter margin would have been 4.45%, or 0.03% higher than the 2017 fourth quarter margin excluding accretion.\nReturn on Average Assets (“ROAA”) of 1.18% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 1.00% for the first quarter of 2017.\nReturn on Average Tangible Common Equity (“ROATCE”) of 11.27% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 11.45% for the first quarter of 2017.\nFirst quarter 2018 loan growth (excluding mortgage loans held-for-sale) of $342.5 million, including $303.9 million acquired in the FirstAtlantic transaction. Excluding loans acquired in the FirstAtlantic transaction, first quarter 2018 loan growth was approximately $38.6 million.\nFirst quarter 2018 deposit growth of $265.7 million. Excluding $374.3 million in deposits acquired in the FirstAtlantic transaction, deposits declined by $108.6 million, reflecting the loss of some deposits associated with the 2017 fourth quarter’s seasonal deposit growth.\n2018 first quarter mortgage production volume totaled $114.9 million, compared to $130.9 million for the first quarter of 2017, reflecting a higher interest rate environment.\n2018 first quarter purchased volume in the factoring division totaled $283.0 million, compared to $253.6 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-acquired non-performing assets of $1.1 million at March 31, 2018, an increase from $759 thousand at December 31, 2017 and a decrease from $2.5 million at March 31, 2017.\nAnnualized net charge-offs of 0.08% of average loans outstanding for the first quarter of 2018, compared to net recoveries of 0.07% for the first quarter of 2017.\nProvision for loan losses of $1.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $1.5 million for the 2017 fourth quarter and $156 thousand for the first quarter of 2017.\nEnding tangible book value per share of $19.21.\nEnding book value per share of $29.35.\nOn March 20, 2018, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire Premier Community Bank of Florida (“Premier”), headquartered in Bradenton, Florida, through a merger of Premier with and into NBC. As of March 31, 2018, Premier had total loans and deposits of approximately $161.0 million and $194.3 million, respectively. The acquisition of Premier is currently pending and remains subject to customary regulatory and shareholder approvals; accordingly, Premier’s assets, liabilities and results of operations are not included in the Company’s totals for the first quarter of 2018.\nThe Company will host a live audio webcast conference call beginning at 8:00 a.m. Central Time on April 25, 2018 to discuss earnings and operating results for the 2018 first quarter. Investors may call in (toll free) by dialing (844) 296-8205 (conference ID 2179627). A replay of the conference call will be available until April 27, 2018 and can be accessed by dialing (855) 859-2056.\nInvestors who plan to participate in the live webcast of the conference call should access the webcast by visiting www.nationalbankofcommerce.com , and then clicking on the “Investor Relations” link under the “Learn More” tab located on that webpage. A replay of the webcast will be available on the website for one year. A copy of the news release will also be available at the same location.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nSome of the financial measures presented in this press release and included in the accompanying unaudited financial statements are not measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures include tangible common equity, return on average tangible common equity, tangible book value per share, efficiency ratio and operating efficiency ratio. The Company’s management uses the non-GAAP financial measures set forth below in its analysis of the Company’s performance.\n“Tangible common equity” is defined as total shareholders’ equity less goodwill, other intangible assets and minority interest not included in intangible assets. “Average tangible common equity” is defined as the average of tangible common equity for the applicable period. “Return on average tangible common equity,” or ROATCE, is defined as net income available to common shareholders divided by average tangible common equity. “Tangible book value per share” is defined as tangible common equity divided by total common shares outstanding. This measure is important to investors interested in changes from period to period in book value per share, exclusive of changes in intangible assets.\nThe Company’s management believes that these measures, each of which utilizes the concept of tangible common equity rather than total common equity, provide useful information to management and investors because they eliminate the impact of goodwill and other intangible assets created in an acquisition. These measures are commonly used by investors when assessing financial institutions.\n“Efficiency ratio” is defined as noninterest expense divided by operating revenue (which is equal to net interest income plus noninterest income), excluding one-time gains and losses on sales of securities. This measure is important to investors looking for a measure of efficiency in productivity based on the amount of revenue generated for each dollar spent. “Operating efficiency ratio” is defined as noninterest expense divided by operating revenue, excluding one-time gains and losses on sales of securities and one-time gains and expenses related to merger and acquisition activities. This measure is important to investors looking for a measure of efficiency in productivity based on the amount of revenue generated for each dollar spent.\nThe Company’s management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP; however, the Company acknowledges that the non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. As such, the Company cautions readers that these disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, and that these disclosures are not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial measures that other companies use. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude various items detailed in the attached “Non-GAAP Reconciliation.”\nAbout National Commerce Corporation\nNational Commerce Corporation (Nasdaq:NCOM), a Delaware corporation, is a financial holding company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama.
