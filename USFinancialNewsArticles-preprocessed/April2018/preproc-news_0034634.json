    "text": "April 19, 2018 / 6:50 AM / Updated 29 minutes ago FCA sends 'Dear CEO' letter to preference share issuers Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s financial regulator on Thursday published a letter to issuers of listed irredeemable preference shares, urging them to ensure their investors have all information necessary to properly assess the risks and rewards attached to such shares. FILE PHOTO: Andrew Bailey, Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Conduct Authority, speaks during a \"Reuters Newsmaker\" interview at the Reuters offices in London, Britain, July 6, 2017. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo \nThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is reviewing certain fixed income shares, particularly those shares that are described as being perpetual, irredeemable or in some other way that suggests permanence, the ‘Dear CEO’ letter said. \nListed companies will need to consider whether any intention to cancel or otherwise retire a class of irredeemable shares, or similar shares, at a price based on factors other than prevailing market price, or their company’s deliberation on any such intention, constitutes inside information, said the letter. \n“We recognise that there is a tension between investors’ desire to see a permanent resolution to any remaining concerns and the desire of company boards not to limit their (and their successors’) scope for action,” it said. \nThe ‘Dear CEO’ letter on the subject of preference shares follows a phase of instability in the pricing of such instruments after insurer Aviva ( AV.L ) announced an intention to cancel certain irredeemable shares it had issued at or close to par value. \nAviva later scrapped its plan following a backlash among investors but other listed companies with irredeemable shares, or similar types of shares, have not clarified their position, the FCA said.
