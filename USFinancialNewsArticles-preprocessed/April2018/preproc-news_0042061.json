    "text": "MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines decried what it said was interference in its internal affairs by the European Parliament, which urged the Southeast Asian nation in a resolution to end “extrajudicial killings” and abandon plans to reintroduce death penalty. \n\nFILE PHOTO: Philippine Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano speaks during the closing ceremony of the 50th Association of Southeast Asia Nations (ASEAN) Regional Forum (ARF) in Manila, Philippines August 8, 2017. REUTERS/Erik De Castro About 4,100 people have been killed by police in the Philippines since President Rodrigo Duterte took power in June 2016 in what the authorities say were shootouts during anti-narcotics operations. \nAt least 2,300 drug-related deaths have occurred separately, at the hands of what police say are unknown assassins. \nThe European Parliament on Thursday adopted a resolution condemning Philippine authorities for “trying to justify these murders with falsified evidence”. \n“The European Parliament has crossed a red line when it called for unwarranted actions against the Philippines,” Philippine Foreign Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano said in a statement issued late on Thursday. \nThe European Parliament and its members have criticized the Philippines’ brutal “war on drugs” several times, infuriating Duterte, who has directed his frustration on the European Union as a bloc instead. \nEuropean lawmakers also called on Manila to remove “human rights defenders” from its list of what it considers as terrorists, including Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, the United Nations special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples. \nThey also condemned “the intimidation and the abuse” of human rights defenders, activists and journalists, and said reintroducing the death penalty in the Philippines was against its international obligations. \n“In case the members of the European Parliament are not aware of it, may we remind them that their recommended actions already constitute interference in the affairs of a sovereign state,” Cayetano said \nHe said the European Parliament’s resolution was based on “biased, incomplete and even wrong information and does not reflect the true situation on the ground”. \nReporting by Enrico dela Cruz; Editing by Michael Perry\n ",
