    "text": "FREEPORT, Pa., April 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Oberg Industries ( www.Oberg.com ), a full-service contract manufacturer of precision machined and stamped components located north of Pittsburgh, Pa., announced today that it has acquired Illinois-based X-L Engineering Corp ( www.XLEng.com ). The family-owned precision manufacturing business is headquartered in Niles, Ill., fourteen miles northwest of Chicago, with an additional facility in nearby Elk Grove Village.\nOriginally incorporated in 1943 as a grinding services company, X-L Engineering now has over ninety skilled machinists primarily focused on the medical device and aerospace markets. The organization will become an extension of Oberg Medical as its XL Division and will be re-branded externally as \"Oberg Medical – XL Division.\"\nX-L's strengths in thin-walled turning, Swiss machining and, in particular, gun drilling will provide new and expanded capabilities for Oberg to offer to its customer base as well as additional resources in engineering, new product development and prototyping.\nDavid Bonvenuto, Oberg's CEO, commented, \"The culture and passion that X-L's management and employees embrace for precision and advanced manufacturing is a perfect fit for Oberg Industries. We believe both Oberg's and X-L's customer partners will benefit from our consolidated ability to provide enhanced manufacturing capacity in core areas of our business while now having new manufacturing capabilities in house that were previously limited in capacity or outsourced.\"\nThe addition of the XL Division will expand Oberg's headcount to more than 900 skilled employees worldwide with combined sales expected to exceed $150 million by the end of 2018. With production facilities in Pennsylvania, Illinois and Costa Rica, Oberg is a strategic contract manufacturing partner for companies in the Aerospace, Automotive, Consumer/Industrial Products, Defense, Energy, Construction and Housing, Medical Device, Metal Packaging and Munitions markets.\nContact: Ken Eck, Manager of Corporate Communications • 1-724-294-1225 • e: ken.eck@oberg.com\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oberg-medical-expands-manufacturing-capabilities-with-x-l-acquisition-300623488.html\nSOURCE Oberg Industries",
