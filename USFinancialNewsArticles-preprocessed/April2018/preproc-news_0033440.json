    "text": "VIENNA (Reuters) - U.S. property investment firm Starwood Capital Group launched its bid for minority stakes in Austrian property companies CA Immo ( CAIV.VI ) and Immofinanz ( IMFI.VI ) as it seeks exposure to markets in central and eastern Europe.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Austrian property goup CA Immo is pictured during a news conference in Vienna, Austria, March 22, 2016. REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader/File Photo “Starwood Capital considers Austria, Germany and (central and eastern Europe) as attractive markets and is committed to increasing its real estate exposure there,” it said on Wednesday.\nStarwood, a private equity firm that says it has $56 billion in assets under management, last month said it wanted to acquire up to 26 percent of CA Immo and up to 5 percent of Immofinanz, at only slight premiums to their share prices at the time, minus any dividends paid before completion of the deals.\nStarwood is offering CA Immo shareholders 27.50 euros ($34.02) per share, minus any dividend paid. The stock slipped 0.2 percent in early trading to 27.44 euros.\nImmofinanz’s shares rose 0.3 percent to 2.196 euros, above the 2.10 euros per share, minus any dividend, Starwood is offering.\nNeither company had an immediate reaction to the offer, noting they had 10 trading days to comment.\nImmofinanz last month dismissed the offer as too low, while CA Immo said it needed more information to form an opinion.\nThe offer for CA Immo runs to May 16, while the offer for Immofinanz lasts until May 30.\nTogether they are worth up to around 824 million euros ($1.02 billion), according to Reuters calculations.\nBoth partial tender offers are independent and are not contingent on any minimum acceptance threshold.\nImmofinanz already owns 26 percent of CA Immo. It said in February it was considering selling that stake after it effectively abandoned its plan to take over the company.\nStarwood has said it supports both companies’ management teams and does not plan to acquire a majority stake in either firm. Both will remain listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange.\nReporting by Francois Murphy, Michael Shields and Alexandra Schwarz-Goerlich, editing by Louise Heavens and Jason Neely\n ",
