    "text": "Shares of the aerospace parts maker KLX rose more than 9 percent on Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported that Boeing is nearing a deal to buy it.\nThe report said a deal could be announced Monday, though it could also fall through. A Boeing spokesman had no comment. A spokesman for KLX wasn't immediately available.\nBoeing Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said in an interview with Reuters on March 8 that the company was looking into an acquisition of Brazilian aerospace company Embraer.\nMuilenburg said in the interview Boeing had enough cash \"horsepower\" to invest in its business, return money to shareholders, and \"make these targeted acquisitions.\"\nMuilenburg also said in a CNBC exclusive in February on the Embraer deal that \"We are making progress, still have some work to do but I am hopeful that we can bring that deal to a successful close.\"",
