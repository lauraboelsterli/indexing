(“American National”) (NASDAQ:AMNB), parent company of American National Bank and Trust Company, today announced net income for the first quarter of 2018 of $5,812,000 compared to $4,063,000 for the first quarter of 2017, a $1,749,000 or 43.0% increase. Basic and diluted net income per common share was $0.67 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.47 for the 2017 quarter. Net income for the first quarter of 2018 produced a return on average assets of 1.28%, a return on average equity of 11.10%, and a return on average tangible equity of 14.29%.\nFinancial Performance and Overview\nJeffrey V. Haley, President and Chief Executive Officer, reported, “We were pleased with our earnings for the first quarter of 2018. Earnings were strong, $5.8 million compared to $4.1 million for the comparable quarter of 2017, a 43.0% increase. There were two major causes of the increase: greater interest income and lower corporate taxes.\n“The main driver was higher net interest income, resulting mostly from greater interest income on the loan portfolio. Net interest income increased, resulting from higher yields and higher loan volume. Average loan volume for the 2018 quarter was up $142.5 million or 11.9% compared to the first quarter of 2017. First quarter of 2018 compared to first quarter of 2017, loans are up $101.3 million or 8.3%.\n“In the first quarter of 2018, our balance sheet experienced $24 million in payoffs associated with several large multifamily loans moving into the permanent, non-recourse market. Most of these projects started as construction loans on our balance sheet and achieved their projected occupancy and overall performance levels, allowing them to move off our balance sheet, as we anticipated. Overall, our loans outstanding declined on a net basis by $14.9 million, or 1.1% from year end because of these payoffs. Of these payoffs, $20 million was received on the last business day of the quarter.\n“We expect loan growth to continue in the remainder of 2018, though likely at a reduced pace compared to the past record year.\n“Deposits have grown substantially. Average deposits for the 2018 quarter were $165.0 million or 11.9% greater than the comparable quarter of 2017. Year over year deposits are up $143.1 million or 10.1%.\n“In this rising interest rate environment, our continuing challenge will be to maintain quality growth in assets and deposits and, at the same time, maintain and improve our net interest margin. Our margin for the 2018 quarter was 3.46%, a two basis point increase from the 2017 quarter.\n“The other driver on the earnings increase was a substantial decrease in our corporate tax rate. The tax cut, enacted in December 2017, reduced our statutory rate to 21% from 35% and our effective rate to 19.5% from 28.3%.”\nHaley concluded, “American National reports results on a quarterly basis, like most publicly traded companies. This inherently results in some volatility in the reporting process. We manage the Bank for the long term, and we believe this reflects the underlying strength of our balance sheet and franchise. We continue to be optimistic about our markets, our industry, and our community bank.”\nCapital\nAmerican National’s capital ratios remain strong and exceed all regulatory requirements.\nAverage shareholders’ equity was 11.52% of average assets for the 2018, compared to 11.97% for the 2017.\nBook value per common share was $24.19 at March 31, 2018, compared to $23.64 at March 31, 2017.\nTangible book value per common share was $19.00 at March 31, 2018, compared to $18.38 at March 31, 2017.\nCredit Quality Measurements\nNon-performing assets ($273,000 of 90 day past due loans, $1,598,000 of non-accrual loans and $1,716,000 of other real estate owned) represented 0.20% of total assets at March 31, 2018, compared to 0.30% at March 31, 2017.\nAnnualized net charge offs to average loans were zero basis points (0.00%) for the 2018 first quarter, unchanged from the same quarter in 2017.\nOther real estate owned was $1,716,000 at March 31, 2018, compared to $1,664,000 at March 31, 2017, an increase of $52,000 or 3.1%.\nAcquisition related financial impact\nThe acquisition accounting adjustments related to our two most recent acquisitions have had and continue to have a positive impact on net interest income and income before income tax. The impact of these adjustments is summarized below (dollars in thousands):\nFor the 2018 2017 Net Interest Income $ 427 $ 434 Income Before Income Taxes $ 350 $ 269 The first quarter of 2018 includes $255,000 in cash basis accretion income related to the early payoff of several acquired loans, compared to $78,000 for the comparable quarter of 2017.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income before the provision for loan losses increased to $14,543,000 in the first quarter of 2018 from $13,134,000 in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $1,409,000 or 10.7%.\nFor the 2018 quarter, the net interest margin was 3.46% compared to 3.44% for the same quarter in 2017, an increase of two basis points.\nProvision for Loan Losses and Allowance for Loan Losses\nProvision expense for the first quarter of 2018 was ($44,000) compared to $300,000 for the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of $344,000. The $44,000 negative provision related to a favorable adjustment on the specific reserve for an impaired loan loss allowance.\nThere was a decrease in the loans outstanding in the first quarter of 2018; loans were down from year-end of $14.9 million or 1.1%. This decline, combined with continued strong asset quality metrics, mitigated the need for provision expense.\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.03% at March 31, 2018 compared to 1.07% at March 31, 2017.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income totaled $3,333,000 in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $3,271,000 in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $62,000 or 1.9%.\nMortgage banking income decreased $79,000 (14.9%) compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nSecurities gains decreased $138,000 (53.3%) compared to the first quarter of 2017. Gains in the 2018 quarter were almost entirely related to changes in the market value of equity securities held by the company, recorded in conformity with new accounting requirements.\nSBIC income increased $129,000 compared to the first quarter of 2017. The Company believes this is a volatile revenue source.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense totaled $10,702,000 in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $10,441,000 in the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $261,000 or 2.5%.\nThe major factor affecting expense was salaries, which increased $198,000 or 4.1%, largely related to normal first of year adjustments. Total bank wide full-time equivalent employees were 326 at the end of the first quarter of 2018, unchanged from the first quarter of 2017.\nIncome taxes for the first quarter of 2018 were favorably impacted by the change in the corporate income tax rate. The effective tax rate for the 2018 quarter was 19.5%, compared to 28.3% for the same quarter of 2017.\nAbout American National\nAmerican National is a multi-state bank holding company with total assets of approximately $1.8 billion.
