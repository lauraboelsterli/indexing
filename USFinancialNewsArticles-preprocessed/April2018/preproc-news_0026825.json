FILE PHOTO: International Monetary Fund (IMF) logo is seen at the IMF headquarters building during the IMF/World Bank annual meetings in Washington, U.S., October 14, 2017. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas \nThe IMF also said in a statement late on Friday that it expects Chadâ€™s economy to grow by 3.5 percent this year, after it contracted by 3.1 percent last year, assuming the terms of the February agreement with its lenders are implemented.
