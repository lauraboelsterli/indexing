    "text": "MUST READ U.S. oil prices slide after IEA casts doubt over demand outlook \nNevertheless, rising rates always hurt fixed-income investments — floating-rate instruments being the exception. As interest rates rise, the prices of existing bonds fall in order to make the yield of their fixed coupons competitive in the market. After decades of generally declining rates and capital gains on bonds, investors may actually experience losses in 2018. \nThat doesn’t mean you should liquidate your fixed-income portfolio. Bonds remain the most important asset to diversify the risk of owning stocks. While most market analysts expect rates to rise from here, nothing is guaranteed, and when the stock market has its next 10 percent dip, you’ll be happy for your bond holdings. \n“When you build a portfolio, you don’t put 100 percent of your money into the highest-returning asset,” Diczok said. “We guess about where the economy and markets will go, but things we never thought possible can happen.” ",
