    "text": "Shares of China internet poker game firms drop on reports of ban April 27, 2018\nHONG KONG (Reuters) – Shares in Chinese companies offering online and mobile poker games have shed up to a fifth of their value over the past week, following reports in local media that the government would ban all poker-related applications from June 1.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria\nCompanies like Boyaa Interactive and Our Game have seen their stocks slide up to 18 percent since the informal directive from the country’s ministry of culture was reported in local media on April 19.\nThere has been no official statement so far and the ministry did not respond to a request from Reuters for comment on Friday.\nA copy of the directive – circulated in local media and seen by Reuters – asks gaming platforms to stop operating Texas Hold’em games, a variation of poker, forbid services that transfer or trade virtual currency and stop the publication of anything poker or gambling-related on Weibo and WeChat.\nBoyaa, Our Game and Chinese internet giant Tencent, which last year signed a multi-year agreement with the World Series of Poker brand, have responded by pulling poker-related games ahead of the deadline, local media said.\nBoyaa did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe company provides web and mobile games including Texas Hold’em and Big Two Poker, and gets over 70 percent of its revenue from online poker games. Our Game said in a statement dated April 19 that it had pulled some of its content.

The proliferation of online poker apps has spawned a black market for buying and selling game coins.\n“This is another concept of gambling. Now the amount and scale concerning Texas Hold’em is relatively large so it needs to be regulated,” said Su Guojing, a special adviser of China Center for Lottery studies.\n($1 = 7.8480 Hong Kong dollars) Reporting by Farah Master; additional reporting by Alexis Tan; Editing by Himani Sarkar ",
