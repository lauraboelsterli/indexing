Handelsbanken shares slid more than 6 percent.\nSweden’s housing market has been rocky for the past six months, with prices declining and activity slowing markedly.\nIn addition, the four biggest Swedish banks’ dominance of the mortgage market has been challenged by a number of newcomers offering cheaper loans and putting pressure on margins.\nThe new mortgage lenders, which can avoid some of the costly regulations imposed on the bigger banks, offer 3-year interest rates as low as 0.95 percent to lure customers.\nNordea’s website offers the same loans at an interest rate of 2.04 percent.\nMOVING HOME Quarterly revenues were down 6 percent compared to last year due to lower mortgage margins, higher resolution fund fees and lower activity in capital markets.\nNordea’s revenue guidance is for slightly higher revenue in 2018 compared to 2017. However, von Koskull said he remained confident that net profit would grow in 2018 compared to 2017.\nThe bank is moving to cut the costs of complying with Swedish regulations and to fall under the supervision of the European Central Bank (ECB).\nSmaller Handelsbanken’s operating profit in the quarter fell to 5.16 billion Swedish crowns ($606 million) compared to a year-ago 5.35 billion, undershooting a mean forecast of 5.25 billion seen in a Reuters poll of analysts.\n“Costs were considerably worse than expected,” Andreas Hakansson at Exane BNP Paribas said.\n$1 = 0.8185 euros Reporting by Johan Ahlander Editing by Keith Weir\n ",
