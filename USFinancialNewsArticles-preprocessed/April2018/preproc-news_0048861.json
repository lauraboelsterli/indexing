The Company’s non-GAAP financial measures presented in this release include core earnings, the efficiency ratio, tangible book value per common share, average tangible common equity, and normalized net interest margin. Management believes that core earnings provide the Company and investors a valuable tool to evaluate the Company’s financial results. Management believes that the efficiency ratio provides important information about the Company’s operating expense control and efficiency of operations. Management also believes this ratio focuses attention on the core operating performance of the Company over time and is highly useful in comparing period-to-period operating performance of core business operations. The efficiency ratio used by the Company may not be comparable to efficiency ratios reported by other financial institutions. The reconciliations of these measures to GAAP measures are provided within this news release.\nAbout First Community Bancshares, Inc.\nFirst Community Bancshares, Inc., a financial holding company headquartered in Bluefield, Virginia, provides banking products and services through its wholly owned subsidiary First Community Bank.
