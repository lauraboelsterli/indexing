    "text": "When it comes to productivity, we all face the same challenge — there are only 24 hours in a day. Yet some people seem to have twice the time; they have an uncanny ability to get things done. Even when juggling multiple projects, they reach their goals without fail.\n\"Time is really the only capital that any human being has, and the only thing he can't afford to lose.\" — Thomas Edison\nWe all want to get more out of life. There's arguably no better way to accomplish this than by finding ways to do more with the precious time you've been given.\nMore from LinkedIn: \nTen reasons nice bosses finish first \nTen habits of mentally strong people \nWant to hire people who are emotionally intelligent? Do these five things \nIt feels incredible when you leave the office after an ultra-productive day. It's a workplace high that's hard to beat. With the right approach, you can make this happen every day. You don't need to work longer or push yourself harder — you just need to work smarter.\nUltra-productive people know this. As they move through their days they rely on productivity hacks that make them far more efficient. They squeeze every drop out of every hour without expending any extra effort.\nThe best thing about these hacks is they're easy to implement. So easy that you can begin using them today. Give them a read, give them a whirl, and watch your productivity soar.\nThey fight the tyranny of the urgent The tyranny of the urgent refers to the tendency of little things that have to be done right now to get in the way of what really matters. This creates a huge problem as urgent actions often have little impact.\nIf you succumb to the tyranny of the urgent, you can find yourself going days, or even weeks, without touching the important stuff. Productive people are good at spotting when putting out fires is getting in the way of their performance, and they're willing to ignore or delegate the things that get in the way of real forward momentum.\n\"Time is what we want most, but what we use worst.\" — William Penn They never touch things twice Productive people never put anything in a holding pattern, because touching things twice is a huge time-waster. Don't save an email or a phone call to deal with later. As soon as something gets your attention you should act on it, delegate it or delete it.\nshow chapters Adopt these 3 habits to be productive every day      1:16 PM ET Wed, 18 Jan 2017 | 01:36 They eat frogs \"Eating a frog\" is the best antidote for procrastination, and ultra-productive people start each morning with this tasty treat. In other words, they do the least appetizing, most dreaded item on their to-do list before they do anything else. After that, they're freed up to tackle the stuff that excites and inspires them.\nThey don't multitask Ultra-productive people know that multitasking is a real productivity killer. Research conducted at Stanford University confirms that multitasking is less productive than doing a single thing at a time. The researchers found that people who are regularly bombarded with several streams of electronic information cannot pay attention, recall information or switch from one job to another as well as those who complete one task at a time.\nBut what if some people have a special gift for multitasking? The Stanford researchers compared groups of people based on their tendency to multitask and their belief that it helps their performance. They found that heavy multitaskers — those who multitask a lot and feel that it boosts their performance — were actually worse at multitasking than those who like to do a single thing at a time.\nThe frequent multitaskers performed worse because they had more trouble organizing their thoughts and filtering out irrelevant information, and they were slower at switching from one task to another. Ouch.\nThey get ready for tomorrow before they leave the office Productive people end each day by preparing for the next. This practice accomplishes two things: it helps you solidify what you've accomplished today, and it ensures you'll have a productive tomorrow. It only takes a few minutes and it's a great way to end your workday.\n\"For every minute spent organizing, an hour is earned.\" — Benjamin Franklin They stick to the schedule during meetings Meetings are the biggest time waster there is. Ultra-productive people know that a meeting will drag on forever if they let it, so they inform everyone at the onset that they'll stick to the intended schedule. This sets a limit that motivates everyone to be more focused and efficient.\n\"The bad news is time flies. The good news is you're the pilot.\" —Michael Altshuler show chapters How to be more productive      5:53 PM ET Thu, 25 May 2017 | 01:03 They say no No is a powerful word that ultra-productive people are not afraid to wield. When it's time to say no, they avoid phrases such as I don't think I can or I'm not certain. Saying no to a new commitment honors your existing commitments and gives you the opportunity to successfully fulfill them.\nResearch conducted at the University of California in San Francisco shows that the more difficulty that you have saying no, the more likely you are to experience stress, burnout, and even depression. Learn to use no, and it will lift your mood, as well as your productivity.\nThey only check email at designated times Ultra-productive people don't allow e-mail to be a constant interruption. In addition to checking e-mail on a schedule, they take advantage of features that prioritize messages by sender. They set alerts for their most important vendors and their best customers, and they save the rest until they reach a stopping point. Some people even set up an autoresponder that lets senders know when they'll be checking their e-mail again.\n\"One man gets only a week's value out of a year while another man gets a full year's value out of a week.\" — Charles Richards Bringing It All Together We're all searching for ways to be more efficient and productive. I hope these strategies help you to find that extra edge.\nDr. Travis Bradberry is the award-winning co-author of the #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0 , and the cofounder of TalentSmart , the world's leading provider of emotional intelligence tests and training , serving more than 75% of Fortune 500 companies.
