    "text": "April 20, 2018 / 8:08 PM / in 8 minutes Hungarian laboratory worker isolated after exposure to Ebola virus Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nBUDAPEST (Reuters) - A Hungarian laboratory worker has been isolated at a Budapest hospital after accidental exposure to the deadly Ebola virus but has shown no symptoms so far, health officials said on Friday. \nThe accident happened a week ago and the employee was under observation in a special unit in the hospital, the national health institute OKI said. \nThe World Health Organization said it had sent an experimental vaccine and other treatments which had been given to the scientist. \n“WHO assesses the risk of Ebola spreading from this event negligible,” it said in a statement emailed to Reuters. \n“The exposed scientist was immediately put under isolation according to standard operating procedures ... The person is showing no symptoms.” \nNeither organization gave any more information about the lab worker or the accident. \nOKI said there was no threat to co-workers or the public. \nMore than 11,300 people died in total during the worst outbreak of the highly contagious disease, which mainly affected Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone from 2013 to 2016.
