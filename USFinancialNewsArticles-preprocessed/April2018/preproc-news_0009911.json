Reuters has not edited the statements or confirmed their accuracy.\n@realDonaldTrump :\n- The Caravan is largely broken up thanks to the strong immigration laws of Mexico and their willingness to use them so as not to cause a giant scene at our Border. Because of the Trump Administrations actions, Border crossings are at a still UNACCEPTABLE 46 year low. Stop drugs! [0740 EDT]\n- The Fake News Washington Post, Amazon’s “chief lobbyist,” has another (of many) phony headlines, “Trump Defiant As China Adds Trade Penalties.” WRONG! Should read, “Trump Defiant as U.S. Adds Trade Penalties, Will End Barriers And Massive I.P. Theft.” Typically bad reporting! [0910 EDT]\n- Thanks to our historic TAX CUTS, America is open for business, and millions of American workers are seeing more take-home pay through higher wages, salaries and bonuses! [1612 EDT]\n- Thank you @WVGovernor Jim Justice. It was my great honor to be with the amazing people of West Virginia today! #MAGA [1628 EDT]\n-- Source link: ( bit.ly/2jBh4LU ) ( bit.ly/2jpEXYR )\nCompiled by Bengaluru bureau\n ",
