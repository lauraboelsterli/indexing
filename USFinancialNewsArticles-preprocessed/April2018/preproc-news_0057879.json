    "text": "0 COMMENTS The dollar notched its biggest weekly gain in a year-and-a-half Friday, powered by strong U.S. data and perceptions that Europe’s economy may be slowing.\nThe Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, rose 1.1% this week, its steepest gain since December 2016. It was recently down 0.1%, at 85.39, on the day.\nRobust U.S. economic numbers have helped buoy the U.S. currency and bolstered the case for the Federal Reserve to raise rates at a faster pace this year. Most recently, a Friday report showed that the U.S. economy grew at 2.3% in the first quarter, faster than analysts were expecting.\nExpectations of rising rates tend to make the dollar more attractive to yield-seeking investors.\nMeanwhile, evidence of a slowdown in Europe has piled up. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Thursday that policy makers needed to better understand what has caused a moderation in economic growth before they can decide on the future of the bank’s bond-buying program.\nThe euro was up 0.2% Friday, at $1.2131.\nWrite to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com",
