    "text": " 39 p.m. ET Share \nBy Jesse Newman \nThe North Carolina farm at the center of a large egg recall had ongoing problems with rodents along with other unsanitary conditions, according to a U.S. government report this week that has reignited concerns over food safety in an industry that has shrunk to a small number of producers. \nAn inspection report by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said poultry houses at a facility owned by Rose Acre Farms, one of the largest U.S. egg producers, had prolonged rodent infestation. In addition, the report Tuesday said conditions in its egg-processing facility allow for pathogens to survive and spread. \nRose Acre Farms, based in Seymour, Ind., voluntarily recalled nearly 207 million eggs on April 13 , after more than 20 people reported salmonella illnesses that have been tied to the eggs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday launched an investigation into a salmonella outbreak that has spread to nine states. \nMoneyish: These are the 12 ‘dirtiest’ fruits and veggies in your fridge \nThe FDA’s report “is based on raw observations and in some cases lack proper context,” said Gene Grabowski, a spokesman for Rose Acre Farms. He said the company was preparing a formal response to the FDA and urged “everyone to wait until all the facts are presented.”",
