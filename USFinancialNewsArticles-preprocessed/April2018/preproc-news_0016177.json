    "text": "LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - Yulia Skripal, who was poisoned in Britain last month along with her father, a former Russian double agent, issued a statement on Thursday saying the “entire episode is somewhat disorientating”.\n“I woke up over a week ago now and am glad to say my strength is growing daily,” the 33-year-old said in the statement issued on her behalf by London police.\n“I am sure you appreciate that the entire episode is somewhat disorientating, and I hope that you’ll respect my privacy and that of my family during the period of my convalescence.” (Reporting by Michael Holden; editing by Stephen Addison)\n ",
