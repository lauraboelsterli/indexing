    "text": "CAYCE, S.C., April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- SCANA Corporation (NYSE: SCG) today announced earnings for the first quarter of 2018 of $169 million, or $1.18 per share, compared to earnings of $171 million, or $1.19 per share, for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in earnings is primarily attributable to higher legal costs and financial advisory fees, as well as the impact of tax reform at the holding company, partially offset by higher gas revenues at its subsidiaries in North Carolina and South Carolina and a net 20 cents per share favorable variance in electric revenues due to the quarter over quarter impact of abnormal weather. During the quarter, electric and gas revenues in the regulated businesses were reduced to reflect estimated amounts to be refunded to customers as a result of the change in the Federal tax rate.\nFINANCIAL RESULTS BY MAJOR LINES OF BUSINESS\nSouth Carolina Electric & Gas Company\nSouth Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G), SCANA's principal subsidiary, reported first quarter 2018 earnings of $128 million, or 89 cents per share, compared to earnings of $112 million, or 78 cents per share for the first quarter of 2017. Abnormally mild winter weather decreased electric revenues by 4 cents per share in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a decrease of 24 cents per share in the first quarter of 2017. Other than the 20 cents per share increase from weather, this increase is primarily attributable to higher gas margins partially offset by lower AFUDC, as well as higher depreciation, and other taxes. Additionally, SCE&G settled interest rate swaps during the first quarter of 2018 and used the associated gains to offset fuel cost recovery. This resulted in a decrease in electric revenue offset by an equivalent increase in other income. SCE&G also recognized an impairment loss of approximately $4 million to further reduce the carrying value of nuclear fuel acquired for use in VC Summer Units 2 and 3 to its estimated fair value. As of March 31, 2018, SCE&G was serving approximately 723,000 electric customers and 371,000 natural gas customers, up 1.4 and 2.9 percent, respectively, over 2017.\nPSNC Energy\nPSNC Energy, the Company's North Carolina-based retail natural gas distribution subsidiary, reported earnings in the first quarter of 2018 of $49 million, or 34 cents per share, compared to $43 million, or 30 cents per share for the first quarter of 2017. This increase is primarily attributable to higher gas revenues arising from customer growth and an integrity management tracker, partially offset by increases in depreciation and interest expense. At March 31, 2018, PSNC Energy was serving approximately 566,000 customers, an increase of 2.6 percent over the previous year.\nSCANA Energy Marketing\nSCANA Energy Marketing, which markets natural gas in deregulated energy markets, including Georgia where the Company does business as SCANA Energy, reported earnings in the first quarter of 2018 of $17 million, or 12 cents per share, compared to $15 million, or 11 cents per share, in first quarter of 2017. This increase is primarily due to lower income taxes due to Federal tax reform, partially offset by the higher cost of gas during the colder than normal weather in January of 2018.\nCorporate and Other, Net\nSCANA's corporate and other businesses, which include the holding company, reported a loss of $25 million, or 17 cents per share in the first quarter of 2018, compared to near break-even results for the same quarter of 2017. This increased loss is primarily due to the anticipated loss of certain tax deductions as a result of Federal tax reform, as well as higher legal and financial advisory expenses.\nDIVIDENDS\nA decision regarding the Company's regular quarterly dividend for the quarter ending June 30, 2018 will be made by SCANA's Board of Directors closer to the record date. Dividends declared would be payable July 1, 2018 to shareholders of record on June 11, 2018. As previously noticed, the payment of dividends will be evaluated quarterly by SCANA's Board of Directors.\nEARNINGS OUTLOOK / CONFERENCE CALL\nConsistent with the fourth quarter of 2017, SCANA will not be providing 2018 or long-term earnings guidance or hosting a conference call due to the pending combination with Dominion Energy. In lieu of hosting a conference call, earnings presentation materials will be made available at the Company's website at www.scana.com .\nPROFILE\nSCANA Corporation, headquartered in Cayce, S.C., is an energy-based holding company principally engaged, through subsidiaries, in electric and natural gas utility operations and other energy-related businesses.
