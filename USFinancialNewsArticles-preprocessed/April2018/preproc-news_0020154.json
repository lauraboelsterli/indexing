    "text": "April 11 (Reuters) - British recruitment firm PageGroup Plc on Wednesday reported a rise in first-quarter gross profit as growth in international markets more than offset a steep drop in earnings from the UK.\nThe company, which finds candidates mainly to fill permanent positions rather than temporary roles, said gross profit rose 10.3 percent to 187.7 million pounds ($266.4 million) in the first quarter ended March 31.\nGross profit grew 12.3 percent on a constant currency basis.\nHowever, quarterly gross profit in the UK fell 7.1 percent, compared with a 2.8 percent decline reported in the fourth quarter.\n“Brexit related uncertainty continued to impact confidence, particularly within our Michael Page business, which was down 10 percent,” PageGroup said.\n$1 = 0.7045 pounds Reporting by Radhika Rukmangadhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri\n ",
