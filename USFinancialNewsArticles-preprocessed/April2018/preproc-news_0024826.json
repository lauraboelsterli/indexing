    "text": "April 13, 2018 / 2:57 PM / Updated an hour ago French journalist suspended by TV company after homophobic comments Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nPARIS (Reuters) - French journalist Denis Balbir was suspended by TV channel W9 after he made homophobic comments off-air during coverage of Olympique de Marseille’s 5-2 win at home to RB Leipzig in their Europa League quarter-final return leg on Thursday. \nTV footage leaked on the internet showing Balbir making the homophobic remarks about the German team after the game. \n“Following the comments made off-air by Denis Balbir after the OM v RB Leipzig game, for which he publicly apologised, the W9 channel has decided to suspended him provisionally from commentating on the competition,” W9 said in a statement on Friday. \nThe TV footage showed Balbir saying: “I’m happy for those faggots who were arrogant after the first leg.” \nOM, who lost 1-0 in the first game, advanced to the semi-finals with a 5-3 aggregate victory. They will face Salzburg. Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Ken Ferris",
