Complete definitions of Boeing's non-GAAP measures are on page 7, \"Non-GAAP Measures Disclosures.\"\nThe Boeing Company [NYSE: BA] reported first-quarter revenue of $23.4 billion reflecting higher commercial deliveries and mix, defense contract volume and services growth (Table 1). GAAP earnings per share increased to $4.15 and core earnings per share (non-GAAP)* increased to $3.64 reflecting strong performance across the company.\nThe company's cash flow guidance is increased to between $15.0 and $15.5 billion, driven by improved performance. Full year EPS guidance is increased by $0.50 to between $16.40 and $16.60, and core earnings per share (non-GAAP)* guidance is increased to between $14.30 and $14.50 on performance.\n\"Across Boeing, our teams performed at a high level in the quarter, driving revenue and earnings growth at all three business units, increasing profitability and operating cash flow, and delivering more value to our customers,\" said Boeing Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg. \"Customers continue to recognize the value of our products and services, with strong orders booked in the quarter for defense, services and commercial offerings, including 221 net commercial aircraft orders.\"\n\"During the quarter we captured important new business, including an initial contract for 28 F/A-18 Super Hornets for Kuwait, a Ground-based Midcourse Defense program contract extension from the Missile Defense Agency, and we delivered the first Space Launch System intertank hardware to NASA. We achieved the first flight of the 737 MAX 7, and delivered the first 787-10 Dreamliner and the first 737 MAX 9. Within our services business, we received a follow-on contract to support the Royal Canadian Air Force's Chinook fleet, captured a landing gear exchange contract for Aeromexico, and released Self-Service Analytics to complement our digital solutions portfolio. All of these milestones demonstrated the value we bring to our customers through the strength of our One Boeing offerings.\"\n\"Our team's strong first-quarter performance, combined with the positive market outlook across our businesses and our confidence in executing on our production and development programs, gives us a solid foundation to raise our guidance for the year. Going forward, we remain focused on our disciplined growth strategy, improved profitability and cash flow to ensure we meet our commitments to our customers and our shareholders.\"\nTable 2.

Complete definitions of Boeing's non-GAAP measures are on page 7, \"Non-GAAP Measures Disclosures.\"\nOperating cash flow in the quarter of $3.1 billion reflects planned higher commercial airplane production rates, improved performance, and favorable timing of receipts and expenditures (Table 2). During the quarter, the company repurchased 8.9 million shares for $3.0 billion, leaving $15.0 billion remaining under the current repurchase authorization which is expected to be completed over approximately the next two years. The company also paid $1.0 billion in dividends in the quarter, reflecting a 20 percent increase in dividends per share compared to the same period of the prior year.\nTable 3.

Debt was $12.5 billion, up from $11.1 billion at the beginning of the quarter, primarily due to the issuance of new debt.\nTotal company backlog at quarter-end was $486 billion and included net orders for the quarter of $34 billion. Backlog was up from $475 billion at the beginning of the quarter, which has been adjusted to reflect the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard (ASC 606).\nSegment Results\nCommercial Airplanes\nTable 4.

First-quarter operating margin increased to 11.0 percent, reflecting strong operating performance on production programs.\nDuring the quarter, Commercial Airplanes delivered 184 airplanes, including delivery of the first 787-10 Dreamliner to Singapore Airlines and delivery of the first 737 MAX 9 to Lion Air Group. The 737 program reached additional milestones during the quarter, including first flight of the 737 MAX 7 and firm configuration of the 737 MAX 10. The 737 program has captured over 4,400 orders since launch for the 737 MAX, including a recent order from Jet Airways for 75 additional airplanes. Reflecting the strength of the cargo market, we now plan to increase the production rate on the 767 program from 2.5 to 3 per month beginning in 2020. Development on the 777X program remains on track as production began on the first 777X fuselage for structural testing.\nCommercial Airplanes booked 221 net orders during the quarter. Backlog remains robust with over 5,800 airplanes valued at $415 billion.\nDefense, Space & Security\nTable 5.

First-quarter operating margin increased to 11.3 percent on solid execution and mix.\nDuring the quarter, Defense, Space & Security was awarded an initial contract for 28 F/A-18 Super Hornets for Kuwait, a contract for the final C-17 for India, and an extension for Ground-based Midcourse Defense development and sustainment from the Missile Defense Agency. We continue to progress on development programs as the KC-46 Tanker program completed fuel on-load certification testing, the first Space Launch System intertank hardware was delivered to NASA, and the second Commercial Crew spacecraft successfully achieved power-on.\nBacklog at Defense, Space & Security was $50 billion, of which 36 percent represents orders from international customers.\nGlobal Services\nTable 6.

Global Services also captured a contract from the Royal Saudi Air Force for F-15 repair support services and a contract from Aeromexico for the 787 landing gear exchange program. As part of Boeing AnalytX, we released Self-Service Analytics to complement our digital solutions portfolio, allowing customers to access data to develop deeper insights into their operations.\nAdditional Financial Information\nTable 7.

Total pension expense for the first quarter was $40 million, down from $97 million in the same period of the prior year. Revenue in other unallocated items and eliminations decreased primarily due to the sale of aircraft previously leased to customers in the first quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate for the first quarter decreased from the same period in the prior year primarily due to the reduction of the federal tax rate to 21%.\nOutlook\nThe Company's 2018 guidance is updated below (Table 8).\nTable 8. 2018 Financial Outlook\nCurrent\nPrior\n(Dollars in Billions, except per share data)\nGuidance\nGuidance\nThe Boeing Company\nRevenue\n$96.0 - 98.0\n$96.0 - 98.0\nGAAP Earnings Per Share\n$16.40 - 16.60\n$15.90 - 16.10\nCore Earnings Per Share*\n$14.30 - 14.50\n$13.80 - 14.00\nOperating Cash Flow\n$15.0 - 15.5\n~$15.0\nCommercial Airplanes\nDeliveries\n810 - 815\n810 - 815\nRevenue\n$59.5 - 60.5\n$59.5 - 60.5\nOperating Margin\n~11.5%\n>11.0%\nDefense, Space & Security\nRevenue\n$21.5 - 22.5\n$21.5 - 22.5\nOperating Margin\n~11.0%\n~11.0%\nGlobal Services\nRevenue\n$15.0 - 15.5\n$15.0 - 15.5\nOperating Margin\n~15.5%\n~15.5%\nBoeing Capital\nPortfolio Size\nStable\nStable\nRevenue\n~$0.2\n~$0.2\nPre-Tax Earnings\n~$0.05\n~$0.05\nResearch & Development\n~$3.7\n~$3.7\nCapital Expenditures\n~$2.2\n~$2.2\nPension Expense 1\n~$0.1\n~$0.1\nEffective Tax Rate\n~16.0%\n~16.0%\n1 Approximately $1.4 billion of pension expense is expected to be allocated to the business segments\n* Non-GAAP measures. Complete definitions of Boeing's non-GAAP measures are on page 7, \"Non-GAAP Measures Disclosures.\"\nNon-GAAP Measures Disclosures\nWe supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial information. The non-GAAP financial information presented excludes certain significant items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing business operations. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide investors with additional insight into the company's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. The following definitions are provided:\nCore Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share\nCore operating earnings is defined as GAAP earnings from operations excluding the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core operating margin is defined as core operating earnings expressed as a percentage of revenue. Core earnings per share is defined as GAAP diluted earnings per share excluding the net earnings per share impact of the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated to Commercial Airplanes and BGS businesses supporting commercial customers. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings/per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as they exclude non-service pension and post-retirement costs, which primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to government contracts. A reconciliation between the GAAP and non-GAAP measures is provided on page 14.\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is defined as GAAP operating cash flow without capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment additions. Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for shareholders, debt repayment, and acquisitions after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long term value creation. Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses free cash flow as a measure to assess both business performance and overall liquidity. Table 2 provides a reconciliation between GAAP operating cash flow and free cash flow.\nCaution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
