    "text": "1 COMMENTS With the stock market starting off the new quarter with a tumble and further into the red for 2018, it makes sense that yields on long-term Treasurys have fallen. What is notable is that they have fallen so little.\nStocks continued their selloff on Monday , putting the S&P 500 into unofficial correction territory, down by just over 10% from its peak in late January. No surprise, then, that investors have retreated to the relative safety of Treasurys. Over the past three weeks, the yield on the 10-year is down to 2.74% from 2.89%.\nThat doesn’t count as much of a decline, especially considering that the 10-year yield started the year at 2.41%. Contrast this year’s first quarter to the first quarter of 2016, when stocks last hit as rough a patch. Back then, the yield on the 10-year fell to 1.74% from 2.3%.\nOne difference between then and now is that in early 2016 a thicket of credit, emerging market and currency concerns had investors and policy makers worrying that the economy could crack . Indeed, the Federal Reserve was worried enough that it dialed back its plans to raise rates.\nSuch fears are largely absent now. Although trade tensions have played a role in the stock market selloff—and could, if they are exacerbated, weigh on the economy—worries over how much the Fed might raise rates and the regulatory blowback companies such as Facebook could face have been important, too. Then there is the simple fact that, at their peak, stocks were looking very expensive.\nPut otherwise, the setback in Treasury yields has less to do with the economy than with investors’ desire to park their money someplace safer while the stock market is unsettled. So what happens to yields if the stock market calms down in the weeks ahead?\nAt first, maybe not much. Treasury yields are still high relative to their overseas counterparts, and this makes them attractive to overseas investors. That is particularly important now, points out RBC Capital Markets strategist Michael Cloherty, because Japan is entering a new fiscal year, and that often leads to increased Treasury demand from institutional investors there.\nBut other factors are putting upward pressure on Treasury yields, and over time these seem likely to outpunch overseas demand. The supply of Treasurys is set to increase as the U.S. government funds its deficit and the Fed winds down its balance sheet. The job market is tight, inflation appears to be picking up, and the Fed is likely to keep raising rates.\nTreasury yields will likely end the year higher than they are now.\nWrite to Justin Lahart at justin.lahart@wsj.com",
