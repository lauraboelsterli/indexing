    "text": "19 COMMENTS \nTHE GREAT AMERICAN road trip still embodies that freedom so deeply rooted in our culture: uninhibited, spontaneous, independent—until you have to sleep, that is. Various options exist for roadside snoozing, from cookie-cutter motels to lumbering RVs . Lately, however, more travelers are embracing an old-school solution with a twist: perching tents atop of vehicles instead of pitching them deep in the woods. \nSpending the night on the roof of the car isn’t quite as precarious as it sounds. Years of engineering have refined these tents, originally made for overlanding expeditions in South Africa and Australia . The mini pop-up sleeping quarters are specifically designed to sit steadily on platforms anchored to the vehicle’s roof rack. Stowed, the tents collapse into slim cases about 8 inches high, like a cargo box. But when intrepid roadtrippers call it a day, they simply park, unlatch the tent, prop it up and climb in for the night, much easier than preparing a campsite.\nOver the last five years, a number of factors have led to rooftop tents’ rise in popularity in the U.S. These include the tiny-house craze, the #vanlife movement (social media users who document their adventures in vans retrofitted as living spaces), and a renewed interest in small travel-trailers among free spirits who seek unconventional vacations. \nRoof tents come in two categories. Soft shells are akin to your basic forest-floor tent but are typically crafted with tougher fabrics, like ripstop canvas. Hard-shell dwellings, on the other hand, cost more but feature sturdier, aerodynamic casings you can open more easily and quickly with help from hydraulic struts.\nMost rooftop tents come with folding access ladders and foam mattresses, which crucially elevate the comfort level compared to the bumpy slumber of sleeping on the ground. They don’t offer much more than sleeping space, but they free up the area near the vehicle for setting up chairs, building a campfire and the occasional Three Dog Night singalong.\nThough roof tents are still a fledgling market compared to RVs or traditional tents, U.S. sales increased fivefold in 2017, according to NPD Group, a market research firm that recently began tracking the category. Antonio Martins, export sales manager of Portugal-based James Baroud, said popularity of its tents is booming in the states and in Europe, where German motorists have become the brand’s largest customer base. In 2017, roof-rack giant Yakima eagerly joined the game, releasing a model of their own after assessing the potential market. \nThese rooftop tents offer a degree of convenience for millennials who are looking to execute easy weekend getaways without investing in gas guzzlers or buying trailers that require storage and maintenance, said Andrew Pasquella, a representative for Front Runner Outfitters. Most weekend explorers can install these tents on their current cars. \nBeyond their ease of use, rooftop tents have another key advantage: They let you access territory nowhere near the beaten path. On a whim you can pack the car, grab a map and head out without being confined to paved roads as you are in an RV. These tents go wherever nimble cars can: bumping up dirt roads in U.S. National Forests or exploring hard-to-access mountain passes, lakes and trailheads. The roof-level offers just enough elevation from dirt and critters to calm most nervous campers in need of a restful night. \nSnug and protected in your perch on the roof, you can enjoy nature from a new vantage point. The scenery is surprisingly different just 6 feet extra off the ground. And when the adventure is over, the tent can simply be unmoored from the vehicle’s roof rack and propped against a garage wall until the next time nature calls. \nGIMME SHELTER // Four Rooftop Tents That Rise to the Occasion POP-UP SLEEPER Front Runner’s Feather-Lite. Photo: Alex Strohl Tepui White Lightning Tepui developed their newly released hardshell roof tent specifically for action-sports enthusiasts looking to create a homebase for their adventures. The two-person White Lightning tent can support a roof rack to securely fasten gear like bikes, kayaks or surfboards on top of the shell. $3,800, tepui.com \nYakima Skyrise Designed for weekend road trippers and vacationers with small cars, the nylon Skyrise most closely resembles a traditional ground tent. Once you reach your destination, it flips open and sets up in minutes, and the Yakima rack system makes for quick installation and removal from roofs in the off-season. From $1,099, yakima.com \nFront Runner Feather-Lite Made from heavy-duty ripstop canvas, the Feather-Lite is crafted to hold up in hostile conditions. Campers can add a drop-down annex that forms a second room on the ground. The main tent opens easily in one motion and is about 8 inches high when closed. From $1,307, frontrunneroutfitters.com \nJames Baroud Evasion Designed for hard-core overlanders (who want relative luxury), the Portuguese-made Evasion won’t seem like overkill for casual campers. Using hydraulic struts, its fiberglass shell opens in 30 seconds. A 360-window offers panoramic views; the XXL size sleeps three. From $3,800, jamesbaroud.com \nMore from WSJ.
