U.S. President Donald Trump toasts French President Emmanuel Macron (not pictured) during a State Dinner at the White House in Washington, U.S. April 24, 2018. REUTERS/Carlos Barria\nA working visit would be more low-key than a full state visit. Prime Minister Theresa May invited Trump for a state visit when she went to Washington in January 2017, prompting protests, and a date for the visit has never been set.\nA spokesman for May declined to comment on the Sky story, but said discussions are ongoing about Trumpâ€™s visit and that it is expected later this year.
