South Korea typically switches to Qatari condensate to replace Iranian one.\nOverall, South Korea's   were 10.91 million tonnes, or 2.58 million bpd, down 14 percent from 12.68 million tonnes from last year, according to the data.\nIn the first three months of this year, South Korea imported 36.70 million tonnes of crude, or nearly 3 million bpd, down 0.4 percent from 36.88 million tonnes from the previous year.\nThe country's final data for March crude imports data will be released by state-run Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC) later this month.\n(Reporting by Jane Chung; Editing by Sam Holmes)",
