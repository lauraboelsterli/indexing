Tennis - ATP - Monte Carlo Masters - Monte-Carlo Country Club, Monte Carlo, Monaco - April 17, 2018 Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov celebrates winning his second round match against Pierre-Hugues Herbert of France REUTERS/Eric Gaillard \nDimitrov was far from his best in the first set, dropping his serve twice against French qualifier Herbert. \nThe 26-year-old Bulgarian rallied back in the second set with consecutive breaks before serving out to love. \nDimitrov secured a crucial break in the fifth game of the decider and went on seal a third round spot with a powerful forehand, which world number 82 Herbert returned long. Tennis - ATP - Monte Carlo Masters - Monte-Carlo Country Club, Monte Carlo, Monaco - April 17, 2018 Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov after winning his second round match against Pierre-Hugues Herbert of France REUTERS/Eric Gaillard \nFifth seed Thiem produced a battling display to save a match point and beat Andrey Rublev 5-7 7-5 7-5 in the second round. \nThiem led 4-1 in the final set before his 20-year-old Russian opponent recovered and was one point away from victory at 5-4 and 40-30 but hit a forehand narrowly wide. Slideshow (11 Images) \nThiem, a twice French Open semi-finalist, regained his timing to break back against Rublev before another break in the 12th game secured victory. \nThe 24-year-old Austrian, who is returning from a five-week absence due to an ankle injury, next faces former world number one Novak Djokovic or Croatia’s Borna Coric for a quarter-final berth. \n“I was 10 centimetres from being out of the tournament,” Thiem said. \n“But I’m happy that I played two hours and 40 (minutes). I’m looking forward to watching Djokovic and Coric in front of the TV, and then playing the winner on Thursday.” \nLast year’s semi-finalist Lucas Pouille blew a one-set lead to suffer a shock 2-6 6-1 7-6(3) defeat to German serve-and-volleyer Mischa Zverev. \nGermany’s Alexander Zverev recovered from a slow start to claim a 4-6 6-3 6-2 win over Gilles Muller of Luxembourg.
