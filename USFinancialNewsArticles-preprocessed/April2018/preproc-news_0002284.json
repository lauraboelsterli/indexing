    "text": "Jimmy Howard recorded his first shutout of the season and the Detroit Red Wings stretched their winning streak to three games by edging the Ottawa Senators 2-0 on Saturday afternoon.\nHoward made 31 saves while notching his first shutout since Oct. 22, 2016 and 24th of his career. Dylan Larkin and Andreas Athanasiou had the goals for the Red Wings, who have been eliminated from playoff contention.\nAnthony Mantha, Niklas Kronwall, Nick Jensen and Egveny Svechnikov were credited with assists.\nLarkin was thrilled to see the veteran goaltender end his shutout drought.\n“Someone who has battled for us all year,” Larkin said during the postgame interview. “He’s been our MVP in my eyes. Good for him. He earned that and our (penalty killing) defense did a great job blocking shots, so we’ve got to keep the momentum going.”\nMike Condon, who has a 5-17-5 record this season, stopped 25 shots for Ottawa.\nThe teams went a combined 0-for-9 on the power play.\nThe first period ended scoreless despite Ottawa holding a 10-5 advantage in shots on goal.\nLarkin’s goal came at 4:10 of the second period after an Ottawa giveaway during a line change. That gave the Wings a 2-on-1 break, and Mantha slid the puck over to Larkin, who fired it in before Condon could recover.\nThat gave Larkin his fifth goal in seven games and 14th of the season. He did not have a goal in 17 consecutive games prior to the hot streak.\nShortly after killing off a penalty, the Wings made it 2-0 at 4:29 of the third. Kronwall ripped a shot from the left boards that deflected off Svechnikov’s skate and onto Athanasiou’s stick. He then slipped the rebound past Condon for his 16th goal.\nAthanasiou also scored against Buffalo on Thursday to end a nine-game drought.\nThe teams split their first two meetings. Ottawa won the first matchup 3-1 on Nov. 2. Detroit pulled out a 2-1 overtime victory on Jan. 3.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
