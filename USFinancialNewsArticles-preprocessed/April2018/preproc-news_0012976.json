    "text": "In a game marred by a second inning altercation between Arizona Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo and St. Louis Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina, David Peralta snapped a tie in the eighth inning Sunday with a two-run homer as Arizona posted a 4-1 win in Busch Stadium.\nAfter Chris Owings opened the inning with a single off Dominic Leone (0-2), Peralta golfed a low breaking ball just over the wall in right-center for his second homer of the year, giving the Diamondbacks (7-2) a 3-1 lead.\nA.J. Pollock added a two-out solo homer off Mike Mayers in the eighth and the Arizona bullpen handled things from there, with Brad Boxberger pitching the ninth to garner his fourth save of the year.\nYoshihisa Hirano (1-0) picked up his first major league win with a scoreless seventh for the Diamondbacks, who won two of three in their first road series of the year.\nPitching ruled most of the cold day, with a brief interlude for a confrontation between Lovullo and Molina after Pollock was called out on strikes to start the second inning. Lovullo argued and was ejected by plate umpire Tim Timmons.\nLovullo appeared to point his finger in the direction of Molina, at which time Molina rose from his crouch behind the plate and tried to get at him. Molina appeared to bump Timmons but wasn’t ejected from the game. The teams congregated behind home plate, but nothing further occurred.\nMolina was involved in St. Louis’ only run, scoring from second in the fifth when Kolten Wong broke out of a 1-for-19 skid by grounding a single into left field.\nLuke Weaver made the lead stand until the seventh, when he allowed a one-out hit to Pollock and was lifted for Tyler Lyons. He appeared to pick Pollock off first, but Jose Martinez dropped the throw and\nPollock stole second. Three batters later, Nick Ahmed’s infield hit plated Pollock to tie the game.\nWeaver gave up just three hits in 6 1/3 innings, walking one and fanning seven in a no-decision. Arizona starter Taijuan Walker checked the Cardinals (4-5) on three hits over six innings, issuing two walks and whiffing three.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
