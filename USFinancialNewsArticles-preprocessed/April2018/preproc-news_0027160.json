    "text": "April 15, 2018 / 4:50 PM / Updated an hour ago PSV claim Dutch league title with 3-0 win over nine-man Ajax Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - PSV Eindhoven claimed a 24th Dutch league title at a jubilant Philips Stadion on Sunday after a comprehensive 3-0 victory over Ajax Amsterdam, who finished with nine men. \nGaston Pereiro and Luuk de Jong fired first-half goals and Steven Bergwijn scored a third after the break for PSV. \nThe victory took manager Phillip Cocu’s side to 80 points from 31 games, an unassailable 10-point lead over second-placed Ajax with three rounds of the season remaining. It was their third championship in four seasons. \nPereiro fired PSV ahead midway through the first half after he reacted quickest when Hirving Lozano’s shot was blocked on the line. \nThe pace of the game was relentless but home nerves were settled when De Jong headed home a second goal from Joshua Brenet’s cross. \nThe title was made safe nine minutes into the second period as Bergwijn showed neat control to bring down a high ball and fired low into the corner of the net. \nAjax had Argentine defender Nicolas Tagliafico sent off for a second bookable offence late on and minutes later they lost Siem de Jong to a straight red card as the visitors were left to contemplate a fourth season in a row without league success. \nPSV have led the league since mid-September, suffering just three defeats all campaign, and are second only to Ajax (33) for the most Dutch title wins.
