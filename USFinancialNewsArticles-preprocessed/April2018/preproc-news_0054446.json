    "text": "LAWRENCE, Mass., April 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Boston Therapeutics Inc. (the “ Company ” or “ BTI ”) (OTCQB:BTHE), an innovator in the design, development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for the potential treatment of diabetes and related complications, held a Corporate Update conference call on Wednesday, April 18, 2018.\nHighlights of the call include the recent acquisition of CureDM , a strategic move that significantly strengthened the Company’s product pipeline. CureDM developed the first in class peptide that stimulates beta cell maturation to restore insulin response. The drug is under further clinical development after achieving positive top-line results in earlier Ph I study. BTI’s existing investigative material, BTI-320 has been clinically shown to be effective in reducing post-prandial glucose excursion that lead to hyperinsulinemia. After the merger, the Company now includes two synergistic treatments that represent an innovative approach to current treatments and the potential to transform the progression of T2DM.\nAnother highlight is the proposed acquisition of Medical Technology Associates II, Inc ( MTA ) which is anticipated to provide the Company with additional areas of growth focused on metabolism and metabolic support. MTA is focused on the development of a safe and effective alternative fluid therapy for use in human and animals, in the field of critical care – the unmet medical need to correct oxygen debt. The MTA investigative materials are an ultra-purified protein-based iron and oxygen carriers that have unique perfusion characteristics since they are 1/1000 th the size of a red blood cell. This novel fluid therapy is designed to be stabilized and packaged for a long shelf life (3-5 years) at room temperature and is believed to be suitable for perfusion in all mammalian species. As noted by CEO, Carl W Rausch, “Also high on MTA’s customer list is the expanding veterinary field in general as there are no dedicated transfusion agents for animal care for companion animals or animals that are part of the various national and international support and care organizations.”\nThe conference call was broadcast live and both the transcript and the audio recording for the call is now available at www.bostonti.com .\nAbout Boston Therapeutics, Inc. www.bostonti.com\nBoston Therapeutics, headquartered in Lawrence, MA (OTCQB:BTHE) and with an office in Albuquerque, NM is an innovator in design, development and commercialization of novel compounds to treat diabetes and diabetes related complications.
