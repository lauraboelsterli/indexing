    "text": "CHICAGO April 20 (Reuters) - Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans on Friday said that because the Fed is aiming for an average of 2-percent inflation, it would not need to respond strongly if inflation rose a bit above 2 percent.\nIf inflation was at 2.25 percent for “some reasonable period of time,” he said, the Fed would only need to coax it lower, not slam on the brakes.
