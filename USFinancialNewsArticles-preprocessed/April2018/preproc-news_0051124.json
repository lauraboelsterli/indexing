    "text": "BERLIN, German business confidence deteriorated for a fifth consecutive month in April, a survey showed on Tuesday, in a further sign that Europe’s biggest economy is losing some of its growth momentum.\nThe Munich-based Ifo economic institute said its new business climate index, which for the first time incorporated responses from the services sector, fell to 102.1 from 103.3 in March. A Reuters poll had pointed to a reading of 102.7.\n“High spirits among German businesses have evaporated,” Ifo chief Clemens Fuest said. “The German economy is slowing down,” he added.
