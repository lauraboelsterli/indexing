    "text": "3 COMMENTS\nWhen the Gilmore Keyboard Festival launches its latest edition in Kalamazoo, Mich., on April 25, Dan Gustin, who has served for the past 18 years as its director and the executor of its radically different award—a $300,000 prize bestowed every four years to a pianist chosen through a unique, noncompetitive process—will be turning the reins over to Pierre van der Westhuizen, former CEO of the Cleveland International Piano Competition. It seems a natural moment to assess the impact the organization has had on the music world.\nCompetitions matter because they afford young classical talents the opportunity to be noticed in a world of ever-shrinking prospects, especially in light of contemporary cultural shifts, and this one certainly started with a bang. When the first Gilmore Award winner was announced in 1991, most professional critics were ecstatic. I was not one of them.\nThe idea, unveiled at a time of pervasive disdain for competitions, which had proliferated almost to the point of irrelevance, was to circumvent their perceived faults. These included artificial pressures on the competitors, repertoire rules that constrained their creativity, juries riddled with corruption (the Tchaikovsky, among others, became infamous in that respect for a while), and even the inevitability, in a format that often relies on simple mechanical polling, for strong personalities to be penalized while mediocre pianists who offended no one were elevated. The Gilmore solution was to first gather suggestions for prospects and then engage a jury to secretly attend real concerts, arriving at the decision through consensus and never informing the candidates that they were under consideration. The result: a winner without a formal competition.\nBut the Gilmore’s first director, David Pocock, had an even more ambitious goal: to find a virtual unknown with such remarkable gifts that he or she was clearly deserving of a major career. It was a Cinderella scenario. But mere talent is insufficient to sustain a career, and my objection was that someone destined for a place at the top of the concert field needed to demonstrate the ambition to get there.\nThat skepticism was borne out by the first winner, David Owen Norris. Immensely resourceful, he had already carved out his own interesting niche in Britain as a pianist, composer, radio broadcaster, columnist and festival director, never anticipating a career as a full-time concert pianist. Now he felt obligated to become one. That’s when his trials began.\nAt the first Gilmore Festival I was having a drink with André Watts when Mr. Norris stopped by my table to announce his intention to confront a New York Times critic who had predicted in a mean-spirited column that the pianist’s forthcoming recital was going to be a mistake. “Was that Norris?” Mr. Watts asked with rising alarm when the winner had scooted away. I nodded. “I have to stop him!” he said and gave chase. Mr. Norris was calmed for the moment, but the cumulative aggravations of a life he never meant to choose eventually took their toll on his well-being, his social life, and his creative aspirations.\nThe second Gilmore winner, Ralf Gothóni (1994), presented a different kind of problem. A devoted chamber player, he simply refused to become a solo celebrity, so opportunities for the organization to exploit the selection were small. Then the nature of the prize changed. Under the short-tenured Irma Vallecillo the award became the musical equivalent of a Pulitzer Prize rather than the unveiling of a diamond in the rough. Leif Ove Andsnes (1998), whose career was already off and running, was her winner.\nMr. Gustin, a solid choice for the leadership role, stayed with the new concept of the award. He steadied the ship and homed in on the nature of the jury, opting for generalists from all segments of the music world rather than teachers and pianists, who often have their own agendas—thus avoiding academic nitpicking as well as over-chumminess in a world where everyone knows who is studying with whom. (The jury is listed each time, after the fact, on the festival’s website, Gilmore.org.) The winners that followed have often been very interesting, beginning with Piotr Anderszewski (2002), a quirky, poetic musician from Poland. Ingrid Fliter (2006), who has become known as a Chopin specialist was next. Then came Kirill Gerstein (2010), trained in both the classics and jazz, who consistently finds new interpretive approaches to the standard repertoire, whether Tchaikovsky or Gershwin (his recent Gershwin album is stunning); Mr. Gerstein had previously been a recipient of the Gilmore Young Artists award. The introspective Rafał Blechacz (2014) took almost an entire year off after winning in order to earn a doctorate. The latest pick is Igor Levit, an adventurous pianist who is universally held in high esteem.\nContrast these winners with the recent results of other competitions, and the Gilmore comes off quite well. The Cliburn’s Yekwon Sunwoo, the Cleveland’s Nikita Mndoyants, and the Tchaikovsky’s Dmitry Masleev can all play piano. But few winners of traditional contests can be said to exhibit as much individuality and creative range as the players emerging from the Kalamazoo program.\nIf the names mentioned here are unfamiliar to you, you’ve confirmed the uphill battle faced by classical musicians today. Mr. Van der Westhuizen, appreciating this situation, plans on keeping the same process in place, while assembling a team that truly understands “the cultural moment” and will thereby find a way to “connect with the next generation.” Stay tuned.\n—Mr. Isacoff’s latest book is “When the World Stopped to Listen: Van Cliburn’s Cold War Triumph and Its Aftermath” (Knopf/Vintage).",
