    "text": "DELSON, Quebec, April 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Goodfellow Inc. (TSX:GDL) announced today its financial results for the three months ended February 28, 2018. The Company reported a net loss of $(1.4) million or $(0.17) per share compared to a net loss of $(5.4) million or $(0.63) per share a year ago.\nConsolidated sales for the three months ended February 28th, 2018 were $96.7 million compared to $113.5 million last year. Sales in Canada decreased 14% compared to the same period a year ago mainly due to a decrease in Pressure Treated Wood volume. Sales also declined in the export market and the USA by 16% and 22% respectively due to reduced demand for hardwood lumber. On the operating side, selling and administrative costs decreased overall by $1.7 million and overall gross profit before selling and administrative costs rose by $3.7 million.\n“It is clear we are moving towards historical result levels for the winter quarter. We are budgeting for a profitable balance of the year. Many measures are being taken to stimulate and grow profitable sales while we keep a very close watch on our cost base” said Patrick Goodfellow, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We continue to receive strong support from our customer and supplier base and employee morale has recovered from the dark days of last year”.\nGoodfellow Inc. is a distributor of lumber products, building materials, and hardwood flooring products. Goodfellow shares trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol GDL.\nGOODFELLOW INC.
