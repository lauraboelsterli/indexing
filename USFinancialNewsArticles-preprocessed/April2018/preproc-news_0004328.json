    "text": "NEW YORK, April 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Sidus Investment Management, LLC and BLR Partners LP (together, \"Sidus,\" \"we\" or \"us\"), collectively one of the largest stockholders of Acacia Research Corporation (\"Acacia\" or the \"Company\") (NASDAQ:ACTG), with aggregate ownership of approximately 4.2% of the Company's outstanding shares, today issued a statement in response to the Company's unilateral appointments of Joe Davis and Paul Falzone to the Board of Directors (the \"Board\").\nFollowing yesterday's appointments of Messrs. Davis and Falzone, who lack any record of public company board experience, the Board is now composed of eight directors â€“ four of whom have been hand-picked by the incumbent Board and never elected by stockholders . Rather than putting these directors up for election at the upcoming annual meeting, the Board appointed Messrs. Davis and Falzone into classes with terms that do not expire until 2019 and 2020, respectively. This is the same tactic used by the Board when it appointed Frank Walsh (appointed in 2016, but not subject to stockholder approval until 2018) and James Sanders (appointed in 2017, but not subject to stockholder approval until 2019). We believe it is important for stockholders to have an annual vote on the directors who are serving as stewards of their capital. Acacia's use of its classified Board to shield newly appointed nominees from a stockholder vote is another example, we believe, of why stockholder-driven change is needed at Acacia.\nWe also have serious concerns regarding the alleged process that was used to identify these two new directors. While Acacia now claims that their appointments \"follows a search process conducted by the Acacia Board of Directors within the past year,\" we note that the Nominating and Governance Committee held just one meeting during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 (the same number it held during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016), and that the Board first considered appointing Messrs. Davis and Falzone two weeks after receiving our director nominations.[1] Considering we know that the appointments of Messrs. Sanders and Walsh were accomplished with only one meeting of the Nominating and Governance Committee, we question how comprehensive the search process was for these latest appointments.\nFurther, to set the record straight regarding Acacia's \"attempt\" to interview our director candidates, we were first notified that the Nominating and Governance Committee would like to meet with our candidates after market close on Wednesday, March 28 th , but that the meetings needed to take place prior to the committee's scheduled meeting on Good Friday, March 30 th . Shortly after receiving the request, we advised that we were happy to make our candidates available but would like to have a dialogue with the Board to address the concerns that we have previously raised. Acacia's claims that our candidates' inability to meet on one day's notice on the day before a religious holiday somehow constitutes them not being made available on a timely basis is, in our view, a blatant attempt at justifying the Board's entrenchment tactics. If the Nominating and Governance Committee was truly interested in meeting our candidates, we doubt it would have given our nominees one day's notice or that it would have filed a preliminary proxy statement for its still unannounced annual meeting date the very next business day.\nIn our view, these actions are yet more evidence of the abysmal corporate governance practices at the Company, which we believe have contributed to Acacia's nearly 67% stock price decline during the last three years alone .[2] We believe the significant destruction of stockholder value highlights the need to overhaul Acacia's leadership.\nContacts:\nClifford Press\n(212) 277-5635\nAlfred V.
