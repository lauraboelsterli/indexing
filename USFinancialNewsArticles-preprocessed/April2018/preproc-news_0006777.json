    "text": "SAO PAULO, April 5 (Reuters) - Latin American equities posted large gains across the board on Thursday, following Wall Street amid more benign international trade talk, and led by Brazil's Bovespa index that also benefited from a key Supreme Court decision. Brazil's top court early on Thursday rejected former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's plea to avoid prison while he appeals a corruption conviction, a vote that likely ends his political career and hobbles any possible campaign for an October presidential election. Lula is Brazil's most popular politician, but is feared by investors for his redistributive policies and his belief in heavy state involvement in the economy. The corruption conviction likely bars him from running, and his imprisonment, which could happen within a week, would make campaigning all but impossible. Brazil's Bovespa climbed 1.67 percent, while the country's real currency rose 0.44 percent, the only significant move in Latin American currency markets. The region's markets were also supported by less bellicose rhetoric from international leaders on ongoing trade tiffs. Larry Kudlow, U.S. President Donald Trump's top economic advisor, said the United States and China were involved in a \"negotiation\" rather than a trade war, while China said the effective date of its planned tariffs on U.S. exports depended on when U.S. action took effect. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau offered a positive assessment of North American Free Trade Agreement negotiations, saying the talks were \"moving forward in a significant way.\" Analysts at multiple Mexican brokerages said optimism over a possible quick NAFTA resolution was supporting the nation's benchmark IPC index, which climbed 1.28 percent. Chile's benchmark IPSA index also jumped 1.44 percent, as the country's dominant export, copper, climbed more than 1 percent on easing trade tensions. While gains were generally well spread, about 20 percent of the IPSA's gain was due to LATAM Airlines Group SA, whose shares climbed 3.7 percent after Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock.
