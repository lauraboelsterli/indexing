    "text": "Boeing is nearing a deal to buy aerospace parts company KLX to expand into the aircraft-services business, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter.\nThe companies are expected to announce a deal on Monday, though the plans could be derailed, the report said, adding that the terms and structure of the deal could not be determined.\nKLX's shares jumped about 8 percent to $78.98 while Boeing's shares were flat at around $341.74.\nBoth KLX and Boeing were not immediately available for a comment.\nKLX said in December it was exploring strategic options, including sale of its divisions or the whole company.\nBoeing's chief executive officer said on Wednesday its services growth would be complemented by strategic acquisitions.\nLast year, Boeing launched a services business as it looks to capture more of the higher-margin services and spare-parts revenue after a plane is sold.\nThe company hopes to generate $50 billion a year in revenue within the next five to 10 years from the services unit that had annual revenue of $14.6 billion in 2017.\nWATCH: Jefferies values Boeing at $400 per share based on free cash flow yield show chapters Value Boeing at $400 based on free cash flow yield: Analyst 8:55 AM ET Wed, 25 April 2018 | 02:11",
