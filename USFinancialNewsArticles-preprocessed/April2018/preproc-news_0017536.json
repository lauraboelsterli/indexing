    "text": "TOKYO, April 10 (Reuters) - Japanese government bond prices were flat-to-slightly lower on Tuesday, capped by a bounce in Tokyo’s Nikkei after a speech by Chinese President Xi Jinping revived investors’ risk appetite.\nThe five-year JGB yield was flat at minus 0.120 percent while the benchmark 10-year yield rose 0.5 basis point to 0.035 percent.\nThe 30-year yield was unchanged at 0.735 percent.\nWhile gains in equities weighed, JGBs drew a degree of support after a liquidity-enhancing auction attracted robust investor demand.\nThe bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge of demand, at the 600 billion yen ($5.60 billion) auction designed to improve market liquidity, rose to 3.91 from 3.55.\nStocks in Asia gained across the board after Xi on Tuesday promised to open the country’s economy further and lower import tariffs on products including cars, in a speech that struck a conciliatory tone on the rising trade tensions between China and the United States.
