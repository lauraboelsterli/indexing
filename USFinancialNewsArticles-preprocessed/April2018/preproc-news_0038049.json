German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas speaks at a news conference in Brussels, Belgium, April 13, 2018. REUTERS/Yves Herman \nMaas was asked whether Syrian President Bashar al-Assad could be part of a solution to the crisis in Syria. \n“There will be a solution involving everyone who has influence on the region,” he told reporters on arrival to a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels. \n“Nobody can imagine someone who uses chemical weapons against his own people to be part of this solution.” Reporting by Robert-Jan Bartunek; editing by Philip Blenkinsop",
