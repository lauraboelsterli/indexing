A rainbow is seen over a pumpjack during sunset outside Scheibenhard, near Strasbourg, France, October 6, 2017. REUTERS/Christian Hartmann \nMarkets on Monday were also eyeing the situation in Syria after reports - denied by the Pentagon - that U.S. forces had struck a major air base there. \nU.S. WTI crude futures CLc1 were at $62.34 a barrel at 0355 GMT, up 28 cents, or 0.45 percent, from their previous settlement. \nBrent crude futures LCOc1 were at $67.43 per barrel, up 32 cents, or 0.5 percent. \nOil prices fell about 2 percent on Friday after   threatened new tariffs on China, reigniting fears of a trade war between   could hurt global growth. \nWith Chinese markets closed last Thursday and Friday, Shanghai crude futures ISCc1 played catch-up on Monday, dropping 0.6 percent to around 400 yuan ($63.43) per barrel. \n“Oil prices have been susceptible to the brewing   China and the U.S....However, fundamental support levels have been demonstrated with OPEC’s suggestion on an production limit extension into 2019,” said Singapore-based Phillip Futures. \nOil prices have generally been supported by healthy demand as well as by supply restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which started in 2017 in order to rein in oversupply and prop up prices. \nIn physical oil markets, OPEC’s number two producer Iraq said on Monday that it is keeping prices for its crude supplies in May steady. \nIn the United States, drillers added 11 rigs looking for new production in the week to April 6, bringing the total count to 808, the highest level since March 2015, General Electric’s ( GE.N ) Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. \nAs a result, U.S. exports have soared in recent months, “more than offsetting the Venezuelan supply disruption” as a result of the economic crisis in the South American OPEC-member, Innes said.
