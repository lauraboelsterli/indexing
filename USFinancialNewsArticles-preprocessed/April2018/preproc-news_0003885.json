(NYSE:MXL), a leading provider of radio frequency (RF), analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits for the connected home, wired and wireless infrastructure, and industrial and multimarket applications, today announced that Adam Spice, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has given notice that he will be leaving the Company on May 23, 2018.\n“I have made the very difficult decision to leave MaxLinear to pursue another opportunity,” said Mr. Spice. “I am proud to have been a member of an outstanding management team that has been successful in creating significant shareholder value, and in positioning MaxLinear to strongly grow across increasingly lucrative and scalable end-markets in the years ahead. I am eager to embark on my next adventure, in the role of Chief Financial Officer of Rocket Lab, an orbital launch provider based in Huntington Beach, California. I wish MaxLinear much continued success.”\n“Over the last seven years, starting in 2011, Adam played a key role as a part of our executive leadership team as we grew from a sub $100 million revenue company in 2011 to one that generated $421 million in revenues in 2017,” commented Dr. Kishore Seendripu, Chairman and CEO of MaxLinear. “Adam’s tireless efforts in this journey, both internally and externally, are greatly appreciated. He leaves a remarkable legacy and has built a highly competent and resilient finance, accounting, corporate development, IT & facilities team. At a personal level, I will miss working with Adam, who has been a great CFO and a close business advisor. On behalf of MaxLinear’s employees and the Board of Directors, I wish Adam great success in his new endeavor.”\n“Adam will continue to support us in the transition process as we recruit a new CFO to build upon the great foundation that Adam has laid out over the last seven years,” commented Dr. Kishore Seendripu, Chairman and CEO. MaxLinear will immediately begin a nationwide search to find a replacement for Mr. Spice.\nIn addition, the Company is reaffirming its guidance for the first quarter 2018.\nAbout Rocket Lab, Inc.
