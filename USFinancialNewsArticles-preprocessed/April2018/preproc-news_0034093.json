Gross margin decreased by 13.8 percentage points to 10.2%. The decrease in gross margin was across all product categories. Net loss was $1.6 million, or loss per share of $0.08, compared to net income of $3.1 million, or earning per share of $0.14, for the same period of the prior year. The Company booked loss on impairment of assets of $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\") decreased by 75.3% to $2.0 million.\n\"Revenue increased by 12.9% to $35.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, benefitted from an increase of 35.8% in blended ASP and partially offset by a decrease of 16.9% in overall sales volume,\" said Zhenyong Liu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Orient Paper.\nMr, Liu continued, \"As previously announced, the Company temporarily suspended its production in January 2018 due to a government-mandated restriction on the natural gas supply, which is the energy resource we need for production. As of March 14, 2018, the company resumed production at its manufacturing facilities. As a result of the temporary suspension of production, we expect revenue to be significantly impacted in the first quarter of 2018.\"\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue\nFor the fourth quarter of 2017, total revenue increased by $4.1 million, or 12.9%, to $35.4 million from $31.4 million for the same period of the prior year. The increase in total revenue was mainly due to increase in ASP and partially offset by decreases in sales volume across all product categories. Production of tissue paper was suspended in September and October for the replacement of coal boilers, and began intermittent production in the following months. In addition, we decreased the production volume of regular CMP, light-Weight CMP and offset printing paper and sales of these products due to environmental conditions in Northern China. The government strengthened its pollution control and rectification measures, resulting in restrictions on production in the manufacturing industry. As a result, the production volume of regular CMP, light-Weight CMP and offset printing paper and sales of these products decreased in the fourth quarter of 2017 as compared to the same period of the prior year. The following table summarizes revenue, volume and ASP by product for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively:\nRevenue from CMP, including both regular CMP and light-Weight CMP, increased by $6.2 million, or 26.5%, to $29.8 million and accounted for 84.1% of total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $23.6 million, or 75.1%, of total revenue for the same period of the prior year. The Company sold 53,705 tonnes of CMP at an ASP of $555/tonne in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 60,701 tonnes at an ASP of $388/tonne in the same period of the prior year.\nOf the total CMP sales, revenue from regular CMP increased by $6.4 million, or 34.8%, to $24.6 million, resulting from sales of 44,411 tonnes at an ASP of $555/tonne, during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to revenue of $18.3 million, resulting from sales of 47,338 tonnes at an ASP of $386/tonne, during the same period of the prior year. Revenue from light-weight CMP decreased by $0.1 million, or 2.5%, to $5.2 million, resulting from sales of 9,294 tonnes at an ASP of $554/tonne for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to revenue of $5.3 million, resulting from sales of 13,363 tonnes at an ASP of $395/tonne for the same period of the prior year.\nRevenue from offset printing paper decreased by $1.1 million, or 16.8%, to $5.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, from $6.5 million for the same period of the prior year. The Company sold 6,512 tonnes of offset printing paper at an ASP of $826/tonne in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 10,815 tonnes at an ASP of $598/tonne in the same period of the prior year.\nRevenue from tissue paper products decreased by $1.1 million, or 80.1%, to $0.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, from $1.4 million for the same period of the prior year. The Company sold 185 tonnes of tissue paper products at an ASP of $1,456/tonne in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 1,129 tonnes at an ASP of $1,201/tonne in the same period of the prior year.\nWe had no revenue from digital photo paper for the fourth quarter of 2017 and for the same period of the prior year. In June 2016, we suspended the production of digital photo paper due to low market demand for our products and are now upgrading the production line to produce more competitive products. We expect to resume our digital photo paper production in the near future.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nTotal cost of sales increased by $8.0 million, or 33.5%, to $31.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, from $23.8 million for the same period of the prior year. Cost of sales per tonne was $527 for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $328 for the same period of the prior year. The increase in overall cost of sales per tonne was mainly attributable to the higher average unit purchase costs of recycled paper board, cost of recycled white scrap paper and additional subsidies to the labors during the production restriction, and partially offset by the use of natural gas and liquefied gas to replace coal into the production. Costs of sales per tonne for regular CMP, light-weight CMP, offset printing paper, and tissue paper products were, $505, $499, $690, and $1,373, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $296, $281, $448, and $1,068, respectively, for the same period of the prior year.\nTotal gross profit decreased by $3.9 million, or 52.1%, to $3.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, from $7.5 million for the same period of the prior year. Overall gross margin was 10.2% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 24.0% for the same period of the prior year. Gross margins for regular CMP, light-weight CMP, offset printing paper, and tissue paper products were 8.9%, 10.0%, 16.5%, and 5.8%, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 23.2%, 28.8%, 25.1%, and 11.0%, respectively, for the same period of the prior year.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") increased by $0.3 million, or 9.3%, to $3.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $2.7 million for the same period of the prior year. As a percentage of total revenue, SG&A was 8.4% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 8.7% for the same period of the prior year.\nLoss on Impairment of Assets\nThe Company booked loss on impairment of assets of $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $nil in the same period of the prior year.\nIncome (loss) from Operations\nLoss from operations was $1.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to income from operations of $4.6 million for the same period of the prior year. Operating loss margin was 4.7% for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to operating income margin of 14.8% for the same period of the prior year.\nNet Income (loss)\nNet loss was $1.6 million, or $0.08 per loss basic and diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to net income of $3.1 million, or earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.14, for the same period of the prior year.\nEBITDA\nEBITDA decreased by $6.2 million, or 75.3%, to $2.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $8.3 million for the same period of the prior year.\nNote 1: Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our U.S. GAAP results, this press release includes a discussion of EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). The Company defines EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is a key measure used by management to evaluate our results and make strategic decisions. Management believes this measure is useful to investors because it is an indicator of operational performance. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, and should not be viewed as an alternative to measures of financial performance or changes in cash flows calculated in accordance with the U.S. GAAP.\nReconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA\n(Amounts expressed in US$)\nFor the Three Months Ended December 31,\n($ millions)\n2017\n2016\nNet income\n-1.6\n3.1\nAdd: Income tax\n-0.4\n1.0\nNet interest expense\n0.4\n0.5\nDepreciation and amortization\n3.7\n3.6\nEBITDA\n2.0\n8.3\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nFor the Twelve Months Ended December 31,\n($ millions)\n2017\n2016\n% Change\nRevenues\n117.0\n134.7\n-13.2%\nRegular Corrugating Medium Paper (\"CMP\")*\n80.4\n77.9\n3.2%\nLight-Weight CMP**\n15.6\n16.7\n-6.8%\nOffset Printing Paper\n18.7\n33.4\n-44.0%\nTissue Paper Products\n2.4\n6.1\n-61.2%\nDigital Photo Paper\n0.0\n0.7\n-100.0%\nGross profit\n20.0\n25.5\n-21.8%\nGross margin\n17.1%\n18.9%\n-1.9 pp\nRegular Corrugating Medium Paper (\"CMP\")*\n16.9%\n17.1%\n-0.2 pp\nLight-Weight CMP**\n18.9%\n25.5%\n-6.5 pp\nOffset Printing Paper\n17.3%\n22.7%\n-5.4 pp\nTissue Paper Products\n6.4%\n11.8%\n-5.4 pp\nDigital Photo Paper\nNA\n-58.7%\nNM\nOperating income\n4.7\n13.0\n-63.9%\nNet income\n1.7\n7.3\n-77.2%\nEBITDA\n19.4\n28.3\n-31.6%\nBasic and Diluted earnings per share\n0.08\n0.34\n-76.5%\n* Products from PM6\n** Products from PM1\n*** pp represents percentage points\nRevenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, total revenue decreased by $17.7 million, or 13.2%, to $117.0 million from $134.7 million for 2016. The decrease in total revenue was mainly decreases in sales volume across all product categories and partially offset by a moderate increase in blended ASP. Production of tissue paper was suspended in September and October for the replacement of coal boilers, and began intermittent production in the following months. In addition, we decreased the production volume of regular CMP, light-Weight CMP and offset printing paper and sales of these products due to environmental conditions in Northern China.

This was mainly a result of the decrease in volume sold, partially offset by increase in cost of recycled paper board. Cost of sales per tonne was $412 for 2017, compared to $325 for 2016. The increase in overall cost of sales per tonne was mainly due to higher average unit purchase costs of recycled paper board, cost of recycled white scrap paper and additional subsidies created by the Company to the labors suspending work during the production restriction in September and October 2017 and partially offset by the use of natural gas and liquefied gas to replace coal in the production. Costs of sales per tonne for regular CMP, light-weight CMP, offset printing paper, tissue paper products, and digital photo paper were, $385, $375, $581, $1,222, and $nil, respectively, for 2017, compared to $280, $261, $494, $1,089, and $2,805, respectively, for 2016.\nTotal gross profit decreased by $5.6 million, or 21.8%, to $20.0 million for 2017, from $25.5 million for 2016.

As a percentage of total revenue, SG&A was 9.7% for 2017, compared to 9.2% for 2016.
