    "text": "April 17, 2018 / 7:35 PM / Updated 5 minutes ago Icahn, Deason suggest monetizing Xerox assets over Fujifilm merger Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Top Xerox Corp ( XRX.N ) shareholders Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason on Tuesday suggested alternatives to the printer maker’s proposed merger with Japan’s Fujifilm ( 4901.T ), including a plan for the U.S. company to monetize some assets.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo \nIcahn and Deason, who own a combined 15 percent of Xerox, have repeatedly urged fellow shareholders to oppose the $6.1 billion Fuji-Xerox deal. \nThe shareholder duo has said the merger dramatically undervalues Xerox and criticized the deal structure, which calls for the U.S. firm to be combined into the Fuji Xerox joint venture, as being convoluted. \n“We believe our plan could create total value of $54 to $64 per share compared to (the approximate) $28 per share in the (Fujifilm deal),” Icahn and Deason said. \nXerox, in a statement, said on Tuesday its board of directors had followed a “comprehensive process” in reaching the decision to approve the Fujifilm deal, including a proper review of all strategic alternatives.
