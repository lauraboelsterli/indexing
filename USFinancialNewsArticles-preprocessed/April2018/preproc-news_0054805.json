We are excited about our long-term roadmaps and focused on delivering sustained revenue growth and profitability.”\nQ1 2018 Results\nAll AMD financial results are reported under the new revenue recognition accounting standard, ASC 606, with prior period financial results adjusted for comparison purposes. Revenue was $1.65 billion, up 40 percent year-over-year and 23 percent quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by higher revenue in the Computing and Graphics segment. Gross margin was 36 percent, up 4 percentage points year-over-year and 2 percentage points quarter-over-quarter. The gross margin percentage increase was driven by a greater percentage of revenue from Ryzen™, Radeon™ and EPYC™ products. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $120 million compared to operating income of $11 million a year ago and an operating loss of $2 million in the prior quarter. Net income was $81 million compared to net losses of $33 million a year ago and $19 million in the prior quarter. Diluted earnings per share was $0.08, compared to losses per share of $0.04 a year ago and $0.02 in the prior quarter. On a non-GAAP (1) basis, operating income was $152 million compared to operating income of $34 million a year ago and $19 million in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $121 million compared to net income of $2 million a year ago and $8 million in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.11, compared to break even from a year ago and diluted earnings per share of $0.01 in the prior quarter. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.04 billion at the end of the quarter.\nQuarterly Financial Segment Summary\nComputing and Graphics segment revenue was $1.12 billion, up 95 percent year-over-year and 23 percent quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by strong sales of Radeon and Ryzen products.\n◦ Client processor average selling price (ASP) increased year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter due to a greater percentage of revenue from our Ryzen products.\n◦ GPU ASP increased year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter driven by a greater percentage of revenue from our new Radeon products.\n◦ Operating income was $138 million, compared to an operating loss of $21 million a year ago and operating income of $33 million in the prior quarter. Operating income improvement was driven by higher revenue. Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom (EESC) segment revenue was $532 million, down 12 percent year-over-year due to lower semi-custom revenue, partially offset by higher server and embedded revenue. EESC segment revenue was up 23 percent quarter-over-quarter, driven by semi-custom, embedded and EPYC processor revenue.\n◦ Operating income was $14 million, compared to operating income of $55 million a year ago and an operating loss of $13 million in the prior quarter. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a licensing gain that occurred in Q1 2017. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to higher revenue. All Other operating loss was $32 million compared with operating losses of $23 million a year ago and $22 million in the prior quarter.\nQ1 2018 Highlights\nAMD continued returning innovation and excitement to the PC market with the introduction of new consumer-focused desktop processors.\n◦ AMD introduced the first AMD Ryzen desktop APUs, combining the high-performance Radeon “Vega” graphics architecture with revolutionary “Zen” CPU cores on a single chip.\n◦ AMD also delivered the next products in the Company’s strong multi-generational roadmap with the launch of its 2nd Generation Ryzen desktop CPUs just over one year after bringing the first Ryzen processors to market. The new 2nd Generation Ryzen processors can deliver up to 15% higher gaming performance compared to 1st Generation Ryzen processors, with the Ryzen 7 2700X processor delivering the highest multiprocessing performance available on a mainstream desktop PC. Adoption of AMD products for the datacenter continued with new AMD EPYC processor-powered platforms and deployments.\n◦ Dell EMC introduced three new PowerEdge platforms powered by AMD EPYC 7000 series server processors.\n◦ Yahoo Japan Corporation and Packet joined the expanding list of global businesses deploying EPYC processors to enhance the performance and efficiency of their datacenters.\n◦ Supercomputing leader Cray announced that it added EPYC processors to its Cray CS500 line of HPC offerings. AMD brought the powerful “Zen” architecture to a variety of new embedded markets with the launch of EPYC Embedded and Ryzen Embedded processors. AMD released new Radeon Software Adrenalin Edition updates to optimize the performance of some of the most popular PC games and improve the eSports experience for Radeon graphics card owners.

The Company also licenses portions of its intellectual property portfolio. (2) The Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment primarily includes server and embedded processors, semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products, development services and technology for game consoles. The Company also licenses portions of its intellectual property portfolio. (3) All Other category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the operating segments. Also included in this category is stock-based compensation expense. (4) Reconciliation of GAAP Operating Income (Loss) to Adjusted EBITDA*\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018 December 30,\n2017 April 1,\n2017 GAAP operating income (loss) $ 120 $ (2 ) $ 11 Stock-based compensation 32 21 23 Depreciation and amortization 44 39 34 Adjusted EBITDA $ 196 $ 58 $ 68 (5) Free Cash Flow Reconciliation** Three Months Ended March 31,\n2018 December 30,\n2017 April 1,\n2017 GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities $ (86 ) $ 383 $ (299 ) Purchases of property, plant and equipment (46 ) (44 ) (23 ) Free cash flow $ (132 ) $ 339 $ (322 )\n* The Company presents “Adjusted EBITDA” as a supplemental measure of its performance. Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting operating income (loss) for depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation expense. The Company calculates and communicates Adjusted EBITDA because the Company’s management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of operating income (loss) or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes that can affect cash flows. ** The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for capital expenditures. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities. The Company has provided reconciliations within the earnings press release of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nMedia Contact\nDrew Prairie\n512-602-4425\ndrew.prairie@amd.com\nInvestor Contact\nLaura Graves\n408-749-5467\nlaura.graves@amd.com\nSource: Advanced Micro Devices",
