    "text": "Net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 totaled $3.6 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, compared with $2.0 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, for the same period in 2017.\nGross loans outstanding at March 31, 2018, excluding loans held for sale, totaled $1.04 billion, an increase of $34.1 million, or 13.7% annualized, compared with the December 31, 2017 balance totaling $1.01 billion. Deposits totaled $1.30 billion at March 31, 2018, growing 6.6%, compared with the December 31, 2017 balance totaling $1.22 billion. Net interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 totaled $11.7 million, an increase of 14.1% over the quarter ended March 31, 2017, which totaled $10.2 million. Net interest margin, on a taxable-equivalent basis, totaled 3.26% in 2018 compared with 3.27% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 3.35% of 2017, with yields and interest income on tax-exempt assets computed on a taxable-equivalent basis assuming a 21% tax rate in 2018 and a 34% tax rate in 2017. The 21% tax rate became effective January 1, 2018, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.13 per common share, payable May 2, 2018, to shareholders of record as of April 24, 2018, a 30.0% increase over the dividend declared in the second quarter of 2017 and an 8.3% increase over the first quarter 2018 dividend.\nSHIPPENSBURG, Penn., April 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Orrstown Financial Services, Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:ORRF), the parent company of Orrstown Bank (the “Bank”) and Wheatland Advisors, Inc. (\"Wheatland\"), reported net income totaling $3.6 million compared with $2.0 million for the same period in 2017. Diluted earnings per share totaled $0.44 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared with $0.24 for the same period in 2017. Earnings in 2018 reflected increased interest income from expanding loan and investment portfolios in an increased rate environment, partially offset by increases in interest expense.\nThomas R. Quinn, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Our solid first quarter metrics validate the continuing effective execution of our strategic growth plan. Both our legacy and newer markets are receptive to our community banking model, and the investments we have made over the past several years are contributing to our improved results.”\nOPERATING RESULTS\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income totaled $11.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, a 14.1% increase compared with $10.2 million for the same period in 2017. Net interest margin on a taxable-equivalent basis totaled 3.26% of 2018, compared with 3.27% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 3.35% of 2017. Yields and interest income on tax-exempt assets were computed on a taxable-equivalent basis assuming a 21% tax rate in 2018 and a 34% tax rate in 2017, reflecting the 21% statutory tax rate that became effective for the Company on January 1, 2018, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The change in tax rate was the principal factor in the decrease in net interest margin on a taxable-equivalent basis from the quarter ended March 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe Company recorded a $200 thousand provision for loan losses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared with zero in the same period in 2017. In calculating the required provision for loan losses, both quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The Company has continued to experience growth in its loan portfolio, as well as the benefit of favorable historical charge-off statistics and generally stable economic and market conditions for the last few years. These factors have contributed to the determination that a modest provision for loan losses in the first quarter of 2018 was required to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses.\nChanges in historical charge-off statistics and additional loan portfolio growth are factors that may result in the need for a determination of additional provisions for loan losses in future quarters.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, excluding securities gains, totaled $4.9 million compared with $4.3 million in 2017.\nTrust, investment management and brokerage income increased $313 thousand in comparing the quarter ended March 31 from 2017 to 2018. Increased estate fees were recognized in 2018 compared with 2017. Overall, fees have increased as additional revenues have been generated from volatility in the marketplace which led to higher fees generated from increased volumes.\nMortgage banking income increased $132 thousand in comparing the first quarter of 2018 with 2017 as a result of the addition of lenders and improving strength in the housing market.\nInvestment securities gains totaled $816 thousand for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared with a small gain recognized for the same period in 2017. At times, the Company may accelerate earnings on securities through realized gains as opportunities become available to reposition part of the investment portfolio under asset/liability management strategies; or to improve responsiveness of the portfolio to interest rate conditions, while also considering funding requirements of anticipated lending activity.\nNoninterest Expenses\nNoninterest expenses totaled $13.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared with $12.1 million for the corresponding 2017 period.\nThe principal drivers of increases in noninterest expenses in comparing these periods were salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, furniture and equipment costs and data processing. The Company's expanded presence in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, contributed to these increases with the addition of branch banking locations in the second and third quarters of 2017. In the third quarter of 2017, the Company also expanded its lending activities in York County, Pennsylvania, with the addition of two lenders focused in that region.\nSalaries and employee benefits totaled $8.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared with $7.4 million for the same period in 2017. A higher level of expense has been incurred over the last several quarters for additional employees as a result of the Company's new branches and overall expansion efforts, increased incentive compensation and incremental expense for additional share-based awards granted in 2018. Costs associated with the Company's self-insured group health plan decreased year-over-year.\nOther line items within noninterest expenses showed fluctuations attributable to normal business operations between 2018 and 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense totaled $492 thousand, reflecting an effective tax rate of 12.0%, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared with $424 thousand, or an effective tax rate of 17.5%, for the same period in 2017. The Company's effective tax rate is significantly less than the federal statutory rate due to tax-exempt income, including interest earned on tax-exempt loans and securities and earnings on the cash value of life insurance policies, as well as tax credits. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2017 to 2018 is principally due to the decrease in the Company's federal statutory rate, which changed from 34% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nAssets totaled $1.64 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $77.1 million from $1.56 billion at December 31, 2017 and an increase of $182.0 million from March 31, 2017. The principal growth components were loans, which increased $34.1 million, or 3.4% (13.7% annualized) from $1.01 billion at December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018 and increased $142.8 million, or 15.8%, year-over-year, and are summarized in the following table, and securities available for sale, which increased $39.5 million from December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018 and $31.2 million year-over-year. Deposit growth of $115.6 million and an overall increase in borrowings of $60.0 million were the primary sources of funding for year-over-year growth in securities and loans.\nThe following table presents loan balances, by loan class within segments, at March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017.\n(Dollars in thousands) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Commercial real estate: Owner occupied $ 119,657 $ 116,811 $ 114,991 Non-owner occupied 247,097 244,491 209,601 Multi-family 53,812 53,634 47,893 Non-owner occupied residential 79,269 77,980 64,809 Acquisition and development: 1-4 family residential construction 9,408 11,730 5,790 Commercial and land development 30,003 19,251 27,648 Commercial and industrial 128,076 115,663 90,638 Municipal 41,679 42,065 53,225 Residential mortgage: First lien 165,499 162,509 143,282 Home equity – term 11,380 11,784 13,605 Home equity – lines of credit 132,684 132,192 122,473 Installment and other loans 25,550 21,902 7,376 $ 1,044,114 $ 1,010,012 $ 901,331 The Company continues to grow in both its legacy and newer markets through its expanded sales force. Loan portfolio growth was experienced in nearly all loan segments from December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018, with the largest dollar increase in the commercial and industrial segment, which grew by $12.4 million, or 10.7%, representing over one-third of the total loan portfolio dollar growth for the period. Beginning in 2017, the Company placed additional emphasis on growing commercial and industrial loans to increase diversification of its loan portfolio. Acquisition and development loans grew $8.4 million, or 27.2%, from December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018 as the need for new construction financing has increased in the market. The commercial real estate segment also grew $6.9 million, or 1.4%, during this period. Year-over-year dollar growth in the loan portfolio was principally in the commercial real estate segment. Year-over-year dollar growth in installment and other loans was principally attributable to purchases of automobile financing loans as the Company continued to increase diversification in the portfolio.\nThe Company has continued to increase both noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposit relationships from enhanced cash management offerings delivered by its expanded sales force. Total deposits grew $80.0 million, or 6.6% from $1.22 billion at December 31, 2017 to $1.30 billion at March 31, 2018 due principally to growth in interest-bearing accounts. Approximately half that growth occurred as certain larger depository relationships, previously enrolled in the Company's repurchase agreement program included in short-term borrowings, were enrolled in a program provided through a third party which provides full FDIC insurance on deposit amounts by exchanging or reciprocating larger depository relationships with other member banks. Year-over-year deposit growth totaled $115.6 million, or 9.8%, with growth principally in interest-bearing relationships.\nShareholders’ Equity\nShareholders’ equity totaled $142.6 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $2.2 million, or 1.5%, from $144.8 million at December 31, 2017. The increase from net income of 2018 was offset by dividends declared on common stock and by a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from changes in unrealized gains and losses in securities available for sale.\nAsset Quality\nThe allowance for loan losses balance totaled $13.0 million at March 31, 2018, compared with $12.8 million at December 31, 2017 and $12.7 million at March 31, 2017. Management believes the allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio remains adequate at 1.25% at March 31, 2018. Favorable historical charge-off data and management's emphasis on loan quality have been significant contributors to the determination that a relatively stable allowance for loan losses balance is adequate even as the loan portfolio has been increasing.\nNonperforming and other risk assets, consisting of nonaccrual loans, other real estate owned, restructured loans still accruing and loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing totaled $11.6 million at March 31, 2018, compared with $12.0 million at December 31, 2017 and $8.3 million at March 31, 2017. The increase from March 31, 2017 principally reflects the addition of one commercial loan downgraded to nonaccrual status in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans totaled 142.2% at March 31, 2018 compared with 130.0% at December 31, 2017 and 198.6% at March 31, 2017, reflecting the fourth quarter 2017 increase in nonaccrual loans. The allowance for loan losses to nonperforming and restructured loans still accruing was similarly impacted and totaled 126.1% at March 31, 2018, compared with 116.1% at December 31, 2017 and 173.5% at March 31, 2017.\nClassified loans, or loans rated substandard, doubtful or loss, totaled $17.5 million at March 31, 2018 (1.7% of total loans), compared with $20.0 million (2.0% of total loans) at December 31, 2017 and $21.9 million (2.4% of total loans) at March 31, 2017.\nORRSTOWN FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC.
