    "text": "Anticipates 39% Year-over-Year Product Revenue Growth; Reiterates $6 million 2018 Revenue Target\nSOUTH ORANGE, NJ, April 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nephros, Inc. (OTCQB: NEPH), a commercial stage medical device company that develops and sells high performance liquid purification ultrafilters and an on-line mid-dilution hemodiafiltration (HDF) system for use with a hemodialysis (HD) machine for the treatment of patients with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), today announced preliminary financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\nNephros expects product revenue for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, to be approximately $958,000, an increase of approximately 39% over the same period in 2017. Total revenue for the quarter is projected to be approximately $985,000, an increase of approximately 34% over the same period in 2017.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the first quarter 2018 is expected to be approximately $668,000, including approximately $588,000 of catch-up supplier payments and approximately $50,000 associated with the company’s move to a new headquarters. Nephros ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 million in cash.\n\"The first three months of 2018 reflected our typical seasonal pattern, yet still recorded robust growth compared to the same period of 2017,” said Daron Evans, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The first quarter is generally our slowest, largely due to fewer infection outbreaks during cold weather months. However, the second quarter is already off to a very strong start, and we remain confident about our 2018 revenue target of $6 million.”\n“We took advantage of our relatively strong cash position to invest in our new headquarters facility, and to bring our supplier payables up to date,” said Andy Astor, Chief Financial Officer. “This puts us in a strong position going into the second quarter, in which we anticipate positive cash flow from operating activities.”\nAbout Nephros, Inc.\nNephros is a commercial stage medical device company that develops and sells high performance liquid purification filters (known as ultrafilters), as well as a hemodiafiltration system for the treatment of patients with End Stage Renal Disease. Nephros ultrafilters are used primarily in hospitals and medical clinics to retaining bacteria (i.e. Legionella, Pseudomonas), viruses, and endotoxins from water.
