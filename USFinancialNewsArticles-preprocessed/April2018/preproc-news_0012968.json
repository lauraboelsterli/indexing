However, fundamental support levels have been demonstrated with OPEC's suggestion on a production limit extension into 2019,\" said Singapore-based Phillip Futures.\nOil prices have generally been supported by healthy demand as well as by supply restraint led by the Organization of the   (OPEC), which started in 2017 in order to rein in oversupply and prop up prices.\nIn physical oil markets, OPEC's number two producer Iraq said on Monday that it is keeping prices for its crude supplies in May steady.\nIn the United States, drillers added 11 rigs looking for new production in the week to April 6, bringing the total count to 808, the highest level since March 2015, General Electric's Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday.\n($1 = 6.2984 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein; editing by Richard Pullin)",
