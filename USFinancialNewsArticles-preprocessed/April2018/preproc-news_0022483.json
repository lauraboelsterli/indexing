The logo of a McDonald's Corp restaurant is seen in Los Angeles, California, U.S. October 24, 2017. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson \nThe moves are part of a turnaround drive led by Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook, who is aiming to recapture market share from rivals ranging from Yum Brands Inc’s ( YUM.N ) Taco Bell to Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc ( DNKN.O ). \nMcDonald’s, which in January reported its highest sales growth in six years, currently serves 150 million customers a year in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland from its around 430 restaurants in the region. \nStarting in May, the fast food chain will begin home delivery in Sweden and Finland, followed by Denmark and Norway in the second half of the year. Elsewhere in Europe, the company already offers home delivery in Britain, Germany and the Netherlands among other countries. \n“I think it’s about being where consumers want to meet us,” McDonald’s Nordic Group CEO Christer Aberg said in an interview. \nThe expansion will create 5,000 jobs in the region, the company said. \nLast year, McDonald’s sales the Nordic region grew 5 percent to 1.2 billion euros ($1.5 billion). \nMcDonald’s in the Nordics operates under a development license owned by British investor Guy Hands, who bought the rights to its Nordic operations in January 2017.
