    "text": "2017 Highlights:\n2017 marked by two transformative acquisitions, further expanding the Company’s real-time digital engagement portfolio and global customer footprint. 2017 revenue increased $4.0 million or 16.3% compared to 2016; Company reports profitability on an operating income ($5.4 million), net income ($2.5 million) and Adjusted EBITDA ($7.5 million) basis. Management unveiled its strategic investment program to enhance its R&D, Sales and Marketing initiatives to drive long-term growth, profitability and cash flow. Matthew Stecker, Chairman of the Board takes on a new role as Executive Chairman, responsible for driving the growth strategy, business development initiatives and long-term strategic planning.\nENGLEWOOD, Colo., April 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Evolving Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:EVOL), a leader in real-time digital engagement, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nCommenting on the Company’s 2017 progress, Thomas Thekkethala, Evolving Systems’ Chief Executive Officer, stated, “2017 was a transformative year for Evolving Systems, marked by the acquisitions of BLS and Lumata. The addition of these two companies significantly enhances our product solutions and further expands our customer base. Over the past two quarters, we have worked diligently to integrate their operations, learning more about their customers and future needs, and concurrently, have identified several growth opportunities that leverage our combined offerings. To capitalize on this, we intend to expedite our investment strategy in 2018. While we will always be focused on profitability and positive cash flow and expect to achieve both in 2018, we are going to invest more in innovation, build out our sales and marketing expertise, and expand our business development team globally to both better serve our ~100 mobile operator customers and broaden our customer base. We will also remain opportunistic with respect to potential accretive acquisitions and will intensify our efforts to market the Evolving Systems story and generate sustainable, long-term shareholder value.”\n2017 Financial Highlights\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $28.8 million, a $4.0 million or 16.3% increase over the comparable year-ago period. Services revenue of $25.4 million that are mostly recurring in nature, increased year-over-year by 15.8%.\nThe Company reported gross profit margins, excluding depreciation and amortization, of approximately 70.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to gross profit margins of approximately 79.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016. This decline was primarily related to the increase in cost of revenue associated with the Company’s acquisitions of BLS and Lumata which occurred in July 2017 and September 2017, respectively.\nTotal operating expenses of $14.7 million in the year-ended December 31, 2017 increased by approximately $0.8 million or 6.0%, as compared to $13.9 million in the corresponding year-ago period. The increase in total operating expenses was primarily related to added expenses associated with the BLS and Lumata acquisitions. Further, there were approximately $1.8 million of one-time charges associated with the acquisitions and other factors, that are not anticipated to repeat in future periods.\nThe Company reported operating income of $5.4 million as compared to $5.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. When comparing the 2017 and 2016 full-year periods, net income was $2.5 million as compared to net income of $3.4 million, with a higher foreign currency exchange loss ($0.6 million increase year-over-year). Net income per share, both basic and diluted was $0.21 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to net income per share, both basic and diluted of $0.29 in the comparable year-ago period. The Company reported Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) of $7.6 million as compared to $7.9 million in the 2017 and 2016 year-end periods, respectively.\nCash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 were approximately $7.6 million. Contract receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts were $10.2 million, an increase of $4.3 million or approximately 73.0%, compared to December 31, 2016. Working capital increased $1.3 million or approximately 16.0%, to $9.3 million as of December 31, 2017 from $8.0 million as of December 31, 2016. The increase in working capital is related to increases in contract receivables, unbilled work-in-progress, and prepaid and other current assets, which were directly related to the acquisitions made in 2017.\nThe Company also announced today that Matthew Stecker, Chairman of the Board of Directors has taken on a new role as Executive Chairman and will be working with the Company on a full-time basis to drive the growth strategy, business development initiatives and long-term strategic planning.\n“This is a pivotal year in Evolving Systems corporate transformation and I look forward to collaborating with Thomas and the team as we work to further integrate the acquisitions of BLS and Lumata, invest in our product solutions to better support our global customers and, seek new opportunities, whether through acquisitions, joint ventures, or strategic partnerships to drive both top- and bottom-line performance over the long-term. We have a very strong customer footprint and decades of proven performance. Key to our future is driving innovation and capturing more wallet share from our installed base, along with driving new engagements that can enhance our value proposition and expand our reach. We are going to invest in our foundation this year, with the sole purpose of strengthening our offering and increasing shareholder value.”\nFourth Quarter Comparisons\nTotal revenue in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $9.2 million as compared to $6.1 million in the comparable year-ago period, an increase of $3.1 million or 50.0%. Driving the year-over-year increase were higher revenues associated with the Company’s acquisitions. Further, the 2017 fourth quarter included a full quarter of revenue from Lumata.\nGross profit margins, excluding depreciation and amortization were approximately 67.0% and 78.0% for the fourth quarters ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.\nTotal operating expenses of $5.3 million increased by approximately $2.3 million when comparing the 2017 fourth quarter and 2016 fourth quarter periods. The increase in total operating expenses was directly attributable to the added expenses associated with both BLS and Lumata, related one-time costs associated with the acquisitions and other factors.\nThe Company reported operating income of $0.9 million for the 2017 fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, as compared to operating income of $1.8 million for the comparable year-ago period. The Company reported a net loss of $0.3 million in the 2017 fourth quarter, which was primarily driven by a $0.6 million foreign currency exchange loss. This compares to net income of $1.3 million in the comparable year-ago period. On a per share basis, both basic and diluted, the Company reported a loss of $0.03 per share for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 as compared to net income per share, both basic and diluted of $0.11 in the comparable year-ago period. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $1.6 million as compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 million in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016.\nConference Call\nThe Company will be conducting a conference call and webcast on Tuesday, April 3, 2018 at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time and 2:00 a.m. Mountain Time.

In addition, the Company is providing in this news release financial information in the form of non-GAAP net income and diluted net income per share and adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, impairment, stock compensation, restructuring and gain/loss on foreign exchange transactions). Management believes these non‑GAAP financial measures are useful to investors and lenders in evaluating the overall financial health of the Company in that they allow for greater transparency of additional financial data routinely used by management to evaluate performance. Investors and financial analysts who follow the Company use non‑GAAP net income and non‑GAAP diluted income per share to compare the Company against other companies. Adjusted EBITDA can be useful for lenders as an indicator of earnings available to service debt. Non‑GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from or as an alternative to the financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout Evolving Systems ®\nEvolving Systems, Inc.
