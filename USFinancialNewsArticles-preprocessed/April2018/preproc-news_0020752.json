    "text": "MIDLAND, Texas, April 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Viper Energy Partners LP (NASDAQ:VNOM) (“Viper” or the “Company”) today announced that production for the first quarter of 2018 was 14.1 Mboe/d (10.1 Mbo/d; 71% oil), an increase of approximately 14% from Q4 2017 average daily production of 12.4 Mboe/d.\nViper's first quarter 2018 average realized prices were $61.43 per barrel of oil, $2.22 per Mcf of natural gas and $24.17 per barrel of natural gas liquids, resulting in a total equivalent price of $49.09/boe, up 17% year over year from $41.80/boe in Q1 2017 and up 12% from the Q4 2017 total equivalent price of $43.76/boe.\nThe Board of Directors of Viper's general partner has declared a cash distribution of $0.480 per common unit for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, payable on April 27, 2018 to common unitholders of record as of the close of business on April 20, 2018.\nThe first quarter 2018 cash distribution increased 4% to $0.480 per unit from $0.460 per unit in the fourth quarter of 2017. When annualized, this distribution represents an approximate 7.5% yield based on the closing price for Viper's common units on April 9, 2018.\n\"During the first quarter, Viper achieved strong quarter over quarter production growth due to increased activity levels across our asset base and accretive acquisitions closed in the quarter, leading to a record distribution. As recently announced, Viper’s proposed tax status election to a taxable entity will expand our investor base and allow us to continue to consolidate the highly fragmented minerals market. Viper offers investors a unique value proposition as the only exclusively onshore focused high growth E&P income vehicle, with a 7.5% current yield that will continue to grow with Diamondback and Permian Basin production,\" stated Travis Stice, Chief Executive Officer of Viper’s general partner.\nThis release serves as qualified notice to nominees as provided for under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b)(4) and (d).

Accordingly, all of Viper’s distributions to foreign investors are subject to federal income tax withholding at the highest effective tax rate for individuals or corporations, as applicable. Nominees, and not Viper, are treated as withholding agents responsible for withholding distributions received by them on behalf of foreign investors.\nAbout Viper Energy Partners LP\nViper is a limited partnership formed by Diamondback to own, acquire and exploit oil and natural gas properties in North America, with a focus on oil-weighted basins, primarily the Permian Basin in West Texas.\nAbout Diamondback Energy, Inc.\nDiamondback is an independent oil and natural gas Company headquartered in Midland, Texas focused on the acquisition, development, exploration and exploitation of unconventional, onshore oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin in West Texas.
