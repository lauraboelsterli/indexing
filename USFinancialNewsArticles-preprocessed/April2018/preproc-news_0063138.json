FILE PHOTO: RWE logo in Essen, Germany, March 14, 2017. Reuters/Thilo Schmuelgen\nCompensation payments for utilities will not exceed a low single-digit billion euros amount and will more likely be in the high three-digit-million euros range, according to a draft proposal being reviewed by Germany’s Federal Environment Ministry.\nThe precise compensation sum depends on electricity prices, and will be finalised in 2023, the proposal showed.\nGermany’s Tageszeitung was first to report on the compensation amount.
