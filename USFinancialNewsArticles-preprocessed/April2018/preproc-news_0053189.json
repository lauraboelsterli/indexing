This compares with fourth-quarter 2017 earnings of $3.2 billion and adjusted earnings of $548 million. Fourth-quarter 2017 earnings included a $2.7 billion benefit from U.S. tax reform.\n“We had a strong start to the year,\" said Greg Garland, chairman and CEO of Phillips 66. \"We delivered solid earnings, operated well, advanced strategic initiatives, and continued rewarding our shareholders with significant distributions. Our earnings reflect the benefit of our diversified portfolio, and we are also seeing positive, ongoing impacts from U.S. tax reform. CPChem has fully recovered from Hurricane Harvey and contributed strong results in the quarter, while successfully starting up its new world-scale ethane cracker. We recently completed yield-enhancing projects at the Bayway and Wood River refineries, and successfully executed major turnarounds at multiple refineries.”\n“Building on our strong record of rewarding our shareholders, we distributed $3.8 billion through share repurchases and dividends during the quarter,\" Garland continued. \"We repurchased over 37 million of our shares, representing a 7 percent reduction in shares outstanding during the quarter. Since our company’s formation in 2012, we have returned over $20 billion to shareholders through dividends, share repurchases and share exchanges.”\nMidstream\nMillions of Dollars Net Income Adjusted Net Income Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Transportation $ 136 105 136 108 NGL and Other 73 20 73 20 DCP Midstream 24 14 24 14 Midstream $ 233 139 233 142 Midstream first-quarter net income was $233 million, compared with $139 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Midstream net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 included hurricane-related costs of $3 million.\nTransportation adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $136 million, an increase of $28 million from the prior quarter. The increase reflects lower taxes and operating costs, partially offset by lower volumes, primarily from the impact of refinery turnarounds.\nNGL and Other first-quarter adjusted net income was $73 million, compared with $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. First-quarter adjusted net income reflects improved realized margins and positive inventory impacts.\nThe company’s equity investment in DCP Midstream generated adjusted net income of $24 million in the first quarter, compared with $14 million in the prior quarter. First-quarter adjusted net income reflected hedging gains, lower taxes and the timing of incentive distributions. These items were partially offset by lower volumes in the quarter.\nChemicals\nMillions of Dollars Net Income Adjusted Net Income Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Olefins and Polyolefins (O&P) $ 224 20 224 95 Specialties, Aromatics and Styrenics (SA&S) 18 15 18 34 Other (10\n)\n(8\n)\n(10\n)\n(8\n)\nChemicals $ 232 27 232 121 The Chemicals segment reflects Phillips 66's equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). Chemicals' first-quarter net income was $232 million, compared with $27 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Chemicals net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 included hurricane-related costs of $75 million and an asset impairment of $19 million.\nCPChem's O&P business contributed $224 million of adjusted net income to the Chemicals segment in the first quarter of 2018. The $129 million increase from the prior quarter was primarily due to improved volumes and margins, reflecting the return to full operations at the Cedar Bayou facility, as well as lower taxes. Global O&P utilization was 96 percent for the quarter, up from 79 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCPChem's SA&S business contributed $18 million of adjusted net income in the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of $16 million from the prior quarter. The decrease was due to turnaround activity.\nRefining\nMillions of Dollars Net Income Adjusted Net Income Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Refining $ 91 371 89 358 Refining first-quarter net income was $91 million, compared with $371 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Refining results in the first quarter included biodiesel tax credits of $2 million. Prior-quarter net income included favorable U.K. tax credits of $23 million, partially offset by hurricane-related costs of $7 million and pension settlement expense of $3 million.\nRefining adjusted net income was $89 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $358 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease reflects lower volumes and higher costs due to heavy turnaround activity, partially offset by higher realized margins. Phillips 66’s worldwide crude utilization rate was 89 percent, compared with 100 percent in the fourth quarter. Pre-tax turnaround costs for the first quarter were $245 million, while clean product yield was 83 percent.\nMarketing and Specialties\nMillions of Dollars Net Income Adjusted Net Income Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Marketing and Other $ 139 86 129 87 Specialties 45 37 45 37 Marketing and Specialties $ 184 123 174 124 Marketing and Specialties (M&S) first-quarter net income was $184 million, compared with $123 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. M&S first-quarter net income included biodiesel tax credits of $10 million. Fourth-quarter 2017 results included pension settlement expense of $1 million.\nAdjusted net income for Marketing and Other was $129 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $42 million from the prior quarter. The increase was largely due to improved realized margins and lower operating costs and taxes, partially offset by decreased volumes. Refined product exports in the first quarter were 190,000 barrels per day (BPD).\nSpecialties generated adjusted net income of $45 million during the first quarter. The $8 million increase from the prior quarter was mainly due to lower taxes.\nCorporate and Other\nMillions of Dollars Net Income Adjusted Net Income Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Q1 2018 Q4 2017 Corporate and Other $ (155) 2,595 (162) (140) Corporate and Other first-quarter net costs were $155 million, compared with net income of $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. The results in both periods included benefits from U.S. tax reform, primarily associated with the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities.\nThe $22 million increase in adjusted net costs in the first quarter reflects the ongoing impact of lower U.S. tax rates on the net costs included in Corporate and Other.\nFinancial Position, Liquidity and Return of Capital\nDuring the first quarter, Phillips 66 generated $488 million in cash from operations. Excluding working capital impacts, operating cash flow was $1.3 billion. Additionally, the company issued $1.5 billion of senior notes.\nPhillips 66 funded $3.5 billion in share repurchases, $327 million in dividends and $328 million of capital expenditures and investments during the quarter. First-quarter share repurchases included the repurchase of 35 million shares in a single transaction for $3.3 billion. The company ended the quarter with 466 million shares outstanding.\nAs of March 31, 2018, cash and cash equivalents were $842 million, and consolidated debt was $11.6 billion, including $2.9 billion at PSXP. The company's consolidated debt-to-capital ratio and net-debt-to-capital ratio were 32 percent and 31 percent, respectively. Excluding PSXP, the debt-to-capital ratio was 28 percent and net-debt-to-capital ratio was 27 percent.\nStrategic Update\nIn Midstream, Phillips 66 Partners recently announced it has received sufficient binding commitments to proceed with construction of the Gray Oak Pipeline system. The Gray Oak Pipeline will provide crude oil transportation from West Texas to destinations in the Corpus Christi and Sweeny/Freeport markets, including the Phillips 66 Sweeny Refinery. A second binding open season is underway to determine the final scope and capacity of the pipeline system, which could be up to 700,000 BPD. Assuming the pipeline is fully subscribed, its capacity could ultimately be expanded to approximately 1 million BPD of long-haul takeaway. Phillips 66 Partners will initially own a 75 percent interest in the pipeline system. Other third parties have an option to acquire up to 32.75 percent interest in the joint venture. If all options are exercised, Phillips 66 Partners would own 42.25 percent. The pipeline is expected to be placed in service by the end of 2019.\nThe Bayou Bridge Pipeline, in which Phillips 66 Partners holds a 40 percent interest, currently operates from the Phillips 66 Beaumont Terminal to Lake Charles, Louisiana. Construction continues on the segment from Lake Charles to St. James, Louisiana, and commercial operations are expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nPhillips 66 Partners began construction of a new 25,000 BPD isomerization unit at the Lake Charles Refinery. The unit will increase production of higher octane gasoline blend components, with completion anticipated by the end of 2019.\nPhillips 66 is constructing 3.5 million barrels of additional crude oil storage at the Beaumont Terminal that will bring the terminal's total crude and products storage capacity to 14.6 million barrels. The new capacity is anticipated to be online by the end of 2018.\nDCP Midstream’s Sand Hills NGL Pipeline capacity was close to 400,000 BPD at the end of the first quarter. Further expansion of the line to above 450,000 BPD is expected in the second half of 2018. Sand Hills is owned two-thirds by DCP and one-third by Phillips 66 Partners.\nDCP continues construction of two additional gas processing plants in the high-growth DJ basin, each with a design capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day. The Mewbourn 3 plant is anticipated to be completed in the third quarter of 2018, and the O’Connor 2 plant is scheduled for completion in mid-2019.\nDCP is participating in the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline project, which will provide an outlet for natural gas production in the Permian Basin to markets along the Texas Gulf Coast and has a total design capacity of approximately 2 billion cubic feet per day. DCP holds a 25 percent equity interest in the project, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nIn Chemicals, CPChem has completed its world-scale U.S. Gulf Coast (USGC) Petrochemicals Project. The new ethane cracker at Cedar Bayou commenced operations in the first quarter, and reached full design rates in April. Along with the two polyethylene units that started up in the third quarter of 2017, the USGC project increased CPChem’s global ethylene and polyethylene capacity by approximately one-third.\nIn Refining, the company is progressing yield-enhancing projects that are expected to deliver a combined 25,000 BPD of additional clean products by the end of this year. This includes the modernization of fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units at both the Bayway and Wood River refineries that were recently completed. At the Lake Charles Refinery, crude unit modifications to run more domestic crudes and reduce feedstock costs were completed, with additional improvements anticipated in the fourth quarter.\nFour Phillips 66 refineries were recognized by the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) for exemplary safety performance in 2017. The Bayway Refinery received the Distinguished Safety Award, which is the highest annual safety award the industry recognizes, and the Sweeny Refinery received the second-highest recognition, the Elite Gold Award. The Alliance and Wood River refineries were both selected as recipients of the Elite Silver Award, which recognizes the top five percent of all sites for safety performance.\nInvestor Webcast\nLater today, members of Phillips 66 executive management will host a webcast at noon EDT to discuss the company’s first-quarter performance and provide an update on strategic initiatives.
