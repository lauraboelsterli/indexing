    "text": "BEIJING (Reuters) - Two dragon boats practising to race on a river in China have overturned and 17 people drowned, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Sunday.\nTelevision pictures showed one of the long, narrow boats packed with paddlers going over on Saturday on a stretch of a river near the city of Guilin where the current appeared to be strong.\nAnother dragon boat arrived at the scene, also full of paddlers, and it too capsized, the pictures showed.\nXinhua said 57 people had gone into the water and 200 rescuers were sent to help. The rescue effort went on late into the night.\nThe accident happened where two flows of the river converge causing a powerful current, the CCTV broadcaster said. Most of those who went into the river were not wearing life jackets, media reported.\nTwo people had been detained in connection with the accident, Xinhua said.\nDragon boat racing is popular in various parts of Asia and the Dragon Boat Festival is a traditional holiday in China, this year on June 18.\nReporting by Elias Glenn and Gao Lianping; Editing by Robert Birsel\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
