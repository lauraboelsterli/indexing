    "text": "April 19, 2018 / 7:11 AM / Updated 3 hours ago Strike cuts French power generation by over 4 GW on Thursday -RTE Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nPARIS, April 19 (Reuters) - A nationwide strike called by unions to protest against the government’s planned liberalisation reforms has reduced French electricity generation at nuclear and coal-fired plants by over 4 gigawatts on Thursday, showed data from grid operator RTE. \nRTE said output had been reduced to zero at the Cordemais 4 and 5 coal-fired units with an installed capacity of 580 megawatts each. \nProduction was also cut at five nuclear reactors. \nFrance’s far-left CGT trade union had called for a walkout at power generation sites and had said it will carry out targeted power cuts during the protest.
