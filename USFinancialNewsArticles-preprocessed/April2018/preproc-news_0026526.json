    "text": "TORONTO and SPOKANE, WA, April 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Hydro One Limited (\"Hydro One\") (TSX: H) and Avista Corporation (\"Avista\") (NYSE: AVA) today announced the achievement of an important milestone in the regulatory approval process of their proposed merger. The companies have filed an all-parties settlement agreement in the merger proceeding before the Idaho Public Utilities Commission (the \"Commission\"). This represents a full settlement which all parties have agreed is consistent with the public interest.\n\"I would like to thank all the parties in Idaho that worked together to reach this significant milestone,\" said Mayo Schmidt, President and CEO, Hydro One. \"The settlement agreements we have obtained in Washington, Idaho and Alaska speak to the long-term benefits of the merger of Hydro One and Avista for customers, communities, employees and shareholders. We are optimistic that we will satisfy all reasonable concerns in all jurisdictions.\"\n\"We believe this settlement agreement represents a positive outcome that is broadly supported by the parties and meets the standards for approval in Idaho,\" Avista Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Scott L. Morris said. \"The settlement agreement reinforces the commitments we've made to our stakeholders in each of the states we serve to maintain our local presence and decision-making, increase our charitable contributions and continue to support economic development, innovation and community involvement. We're confident our partnership with Hydro One enhances our ability to provide exceptional service and support to our customers and communities well into the future.\"\nThe settlement agreement includes financial and non-financial commitments that align in value with the settlement agreement reached in Washington. The settlement agreement in Idaho confirms our commitment to customers, community investment and long-term environmental protections. Under the settlement agreement, customers in Idaho would receive immediate financial benefits in the form of rate credits that would become effective at the close of the transaction. No costs associated with the transaction will be recovered from Avista or Hydro One customers.\nPlease refer to www.puc.idaho.gov for the joint applications and settlement agreement (which includes the complete list of commitments).\nThe settlement agreement is subject to Commission approval.\nIn addition to Hydro One and Avista, the parties to the merger proceeding in Idaho include Commission Staff, Idaho Forest Group, Clearwater Paper Corporation, Community Action Partnership Association of Idaho, Idaho Conservation League and the Washington and Northern Idaho District Council of Laborers.\nApplications for regulatory approval of the transaction are still pending with utility commissions in Washington, Idaho, Oregon, Montana and Alaska. An all-party, all issues settlement agreement was filed with the Regulatory Commission of Alaska on April 3, 2018. An all-party, all-issues settlement agreement was filed with the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission on March 27, 2018.\nApproval must be obtained from the Federal Communications Commission. Also required is clearance by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.\nHydro One and Avista received antitrust clearance on April 6, 2018 after the expiration of the waiting period under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. The transaction received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on January 16, 2018 and from Avista shareholders on November 21, 2017. Hydro One and Avista continue to anticipate closing the transaction in the second half of 2018.\nAbout Hydro One Limited\nWe are Ontario's largest electricity transmission and distribution provider with more than 1.3 million valued customers, over C$25 billion in assets and 2017 annual revenues of nearly C$6 billion.
