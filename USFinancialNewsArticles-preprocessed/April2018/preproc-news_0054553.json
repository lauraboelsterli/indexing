    "text": "GREENVILLE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Union Bank (OTCQX: UBNC) reports earnings results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and announces cash dividend of $0.09 per share.\nUnion Bank (the “Bank”) is pleased to report earnings results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Unaudited net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $1,501,000 or $.26 per basic share, compared to $674,000 or $.20 per basic share for the prior year. Core earnings, a non-GAAP measure, which excludes merger and conversion related expenses were approximately $1,505,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to core earnings of $782,000 for the same period in the prior year. This represents a 92.5% increase in core earnings.\nThe acquisition of Union Bank & Trust, and its holding company, Union Banc Corp., during the third quarter of 2017, resulted in significant increases in the Bank’s total assets, loans and deposits. Total assets as of March 31, 2018 were $706.3 million, compared to total assets of $702.5 million as of December 31, 2017. Total loans, net of reserves, were $501.7 million and deposits were $600.1 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to net loan balances of $505.0 million, and deposits of $593.7 million, as of December 31, 2017. Shares of common stock issued and outstanding totaled 5,816,138 as of March 31, 2018. First quarter financial activity included measurement period adjustments to recognize additional credit marks related to purchased credit impaired (PCI) loans acquired in the transaction with Union Bank & Trust. Recognition of these additional credit marks and related accounting adjustments resulted in the addition of $2.5 million in goodwill. PCI loans totaled $9.4 million and had total credit marks of $4.1 million (43.5%). Management does not anticipate any additional changes to the Day 1 acquisition accounting going forward.\nUnion Bank also announced today that its Board of Directors, on April 19, 2018, approved a semi-annual cash dividend of $0.09 per share on the Bank’s common stock. The dividend is payable on June 29, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 15, 2018.\nRob Jones, President and Chief Executive Officer stated, “We are pleased to announce a cash dividend and present this positive earnings report for the first quarter of 2018.” Jones further stated “As we have emerged from the completion of our merger that took place in the second half of 2017, I am pleased to report that total deposits, demand deposit accounts and non-interest income are all growing after a period of flatness just after the merger and conversion. For example, demand deposit accounts grew by over 100 accounts in March alone. Total non-brokered deposits have increased $10.2 million since January and total non-maturity deposits have grown $14.2 million since January. Loan levels have been flat as we have struggled to find loan demand outside of the commercial real estate space. Management will be turning its attention to overall loan growth and expense control in the coming quarters while maintaining an appropriate discipline around loan quality.”\nUnion Bank is headquartered in Greenville, North Carolina and operates 15 branches located in 11 counties throughout Eastern and Central North Carolina. Union Bank stock is traded on the OTCQX trading under the symbol UBNC.\nThis press release includes certain forward-looking statements in reliance on the “safe-harbor” provisions of The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
