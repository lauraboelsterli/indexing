Revenue soared 97 percent to 579.8 million pounds, ahead of company guidance.\nShares in Boohoo, which listed in 2014 at 50 pence, were up 21.4 pence at 176 pence at 0835 GMT, valuing the business at 2 billion pounds.\nThe stock has come off from 273 pence in June last year, on concerns profit growth will be held back by a step-up in investment.\nHowever, Boohoo said on Wednesday it could invest more in systems, technology, warehouses, distribution and marketing, while still delivering substantial sales and profit growth.\nCapital expenditure in 2018-19 would be 50-60 million pounds. Revenue growth was forecast at 35-40 percent, with a profit (EBITDA) margin of 9-10 percent.\nLooking beyond 2018-19 it forecast sales growth of “at least” 25 percent, whilst maintaining a 10 percent EBITDA margin.\n“Critically, fears of a ‘margin reset’ have not been realised,” said analysts at Peel Hunt, reiterating their “buy” recommendation.\n“Changes to distribution plans means the next move is likely to be overseas,” they said.
