    "text": "April 21, 2018 / 8:51 AM / Updated 12 hours ago U.S. President Trump to visit UK mid-year, possibly July - reports Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will visit Britain midway through 2018, possibly in July, British newspapers reported on Saturday, citing government sources in Washington and London. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a joint news conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., April 18, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque \nA spokeswoman for Prime Minister Theresa May’s office said officials were still working out the details of a visit by Trump after the Daily Mail, citing a British government source, said that dates in mid-July have been pencilled in. \nBritain is keen to reinforce its “special relationship” with the United States as May’s government prepares to leave the European Union, a divorce that will shape the country’s standing in the world, but Trump has yet to visit London. \nThe Daily Telegraph quoted an unnamed official in the Trump administration as saying the president was looking at a visit to Britain in “late summer”. \nMany British voters have said that if the U.S. President comes to Britain they would protest on a range of issues. \nThe U.S. Embassy in London was not immediately available for comment on the reports.
