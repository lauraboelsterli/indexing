(“Golden Leaf” or the “Company”) (CSE:GLH) (OTCQB:GLDFF), a leading cannabis oil solutions company built around recognized brands, today announced the appointment of Karl R. “Rick” Miller, Jr. to the Company’s Board of Directors, effective April 17, filling a previously vacated board position. With his addition to the Board, he will join the Audit and Nomination and Compensation Committees.\nMr. Miller is a seventh generation Oregonian with a prominent local presence as an entrepreneur, highlighted by his co-founding of Rogue Venture Partners, a private equity firm that provides funding and mentorship to other entrepreneurs in Oregon. He was also a founder and served as chairman of the Avamere Group, one of the Northwest's largest senior care and housing providers. Mr. Miller currently serves on the boards of the Oregon Investment Council, Diabetomics, Payless Pharmacy and is Chairman of Portland State University Board of Trustees. Rick is past chairman of the American Health Care Organization, the Oregon Health Care Association and the Portland-based chapter of the Young Presidents’ Organization. Mr. Miller also previously served as Chairman of the Board at Golden Leaf for approximately 2 months in late 2015, before stepping down due to personal reasons.\n“We are pleased to welcome Rick back to Golden Leaf’s Board. Rick has been involved with the Company since its early days. His proven expertise as an entrepreneur, mentorship to growing businesses, and affiliations across multiple healthcare-focused organizations make him an ideal fit for our Board,\" said William Simpson, CEO of Golden Leaf. \"We look forward to his contributions, as Golden Leaf looks to leverage its established presence in Portland, Oregon to expand its validated business model into new markets, with an initial focus on Nevada and Canada.”\nMr. Miller commented, “As an early investor in Golden Leaf, I am delighted to rejoin the Board at this exciting time in the Company’s history. Golden Leaf is well-positioned to achieve rapid growth as it continues to enhance its retail brand across its target markets. I look forward to working with my fellow directors and utilizing my background in venture capital and private equity, and my passion for helping companies grow to help drive value creation for all of our shareholders.”\nAmong multiple honors and awards received, Mr. Miller was recognized in Portland Business Journal’s “Forty Under 40” in 2004 and his company has repeatedly been selected as one of “Oregon’s Most Admired Companies”.
