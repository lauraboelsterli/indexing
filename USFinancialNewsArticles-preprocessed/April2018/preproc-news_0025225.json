S&P 500 e-minis fell 26.75 points, or 1.01 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis declined 68 points, or 1.03 percent.\nThe main U.S. indexes closed up nearly 2 percent on Tuesday after Chinese President Xi Jinping promised to lower import tariffs, in an attempt to defuse trade dispute with the United States.\nInvestors will also looking forward to an update on inflation and monetary policy.\nThe Labor Department is expected to say its seasonally adjusted consumer price index will remain unchanged in March, after a 0.2 percent gain in February.\nThe core CPI is seen increasing 2.1 percent year-on-year, up from 1.8 percent in the previous month. The report is due at 8:30 a.m. ET.\nThe Federal Reserve is set to release the minutes of its meeting held in mid-March, at which it voted to raise interest rates.\nThe minutes will also show the view within the Fed on the possible impact of the Trump administration’s trade policies.\nAmong stocks, Facebook Inc shares were down more than 1 percent in premarket trading.\nShares closed up 4.5 percent on Tuesday after Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, in the first of two U.S. congressional hearings, made no further promise to support new legislation or change how the social network does business.
