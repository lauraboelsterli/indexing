    "text": "April 3, 2018 / 11:20 AM / Updated 3 hours ago Trump on Twitter (April 3) - Sinclair, Honduras, CNN Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nThe following statements were posted to the verified Twitter accounts of U.S. President Donald Trump, @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS. U.S. President Donald Trump participates in the annual White House Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, April 2, 2018. REUTERS/Leah Millis \nThe opinions expressed are his own. Reuters has not edited the statements or confirmed their accuracy. \n@realDonaldTrump : \n- The Fake News Networks, those that knowingly have a sick and biased AGENDA, are worried about the competition and quality of Sinclair Broadcast. The “Fakers” at CNN, NBC, ABC & CBS have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction! [0634 EDT] \n- The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our “Weak Laws” Border, had better be stopped before it gets there. Cash cow NAFTA is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW! [0649 EDT] \n- Check out the fact that you can’t get a job at ratings challenged @CNN unless you state that you are totally anti-Trump? Little Jeff Zuker, whose job is in jeopardy, is not having much fun lately. They should clean up and strengthen CNN and get back to honest reporting! [0658 EDT] \n- Thank you to Rasmussen for the honest polling. Just hit 50%, which is higher than Cheatin’ Obama at the same time in his Administration. [0708 EDT]",
