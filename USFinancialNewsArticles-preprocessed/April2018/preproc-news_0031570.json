    "text": "(Reuters) - Indian shares ended higher for a ninth straight session on Tuesday, marking their longest winning streak in over three years, as consumer stocks gained on forecasts of average monsoon this year.\nThe Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) building is pictured next to a police van in Mumbai, India, August 24, 2015. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/File Photo After two years of normal monsoons, the India Meteorological Department on Monday predicted yet another year of normal rains, raising the possibility of higher farm and economic growth in Asiaâ€™s third-biggest economy.\nThe broader NSE Nifty ended 0.19 percent higher at 10,548.70, marking its longest winning streak since late January 2015.\nThe benchmark BSE Sensex posted its longest winning run since early September 2014, after closing 0.26 percent higher at 34,395.06.\nThe Nifty FMCG index ended nearly a percent higher, with Kit Kat chocolate maker Nestle India Ltd and diversified consumer goods manufacturer Hindustan Unilever Ltd hitting their record highs during the session.\nReporting by Vishal Sridhar in Bengaluru, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ",
