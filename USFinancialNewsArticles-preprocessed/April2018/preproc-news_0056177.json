    "text": "CARTHAGE, Mo., April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\n1Q sales were $1,029 million, a 7% increase versus 1Q 2017; same location sales grew 6% 1Q EPS was $.57, a decrease of $.05 versus 1Q 2017, primarily due to inflation impacts 2018 sales guidance raised to $4.3-4.4 billion; EPS guidance lowered $.05 to $2.60-2.80\nDiversified manufacturer Leggett & Platt reported first quarter sales of $1,029 million, an increase of 7% versus first quarter 2017. Raw material-related price increases and currency impact added 5% and volume grew 1%. Acquisitions also contributed 2% to sales growth but were partially offset by divestitures.\nFirst quarter earnings were $.57 per share, down 8% versus the $.62 per share earned in first quarter 2017, primarily from higher raw material costs. As expected, EBIT and EBIT margin declined due to the pricing lag the company experiences when passing along commodity inflation.\nCEO Comments\nPresident and CEO Karl G. Glassman commented, \"We are pleased to have started the year with 7% sales growth, benefiting meaningfully from inflation and currency. Volume growth reflected continued strength in Automotive and Adjustable Bed, but these gains were largely offset by soft demand in several other businesses. We continue to be encouraged by opportunities we have developed in our Bedding business and expect market improvement as 2018 progresses. We are benefiting from increased content as we continue to place higher value components in more of the mattresses that our customers produce. The PHC acquisition we completed at the end of January in our new Hydraulic Cylinders business unit also added to sales growth during the quarter.\n\"Inflation continues to be a significant margin headwind. Steel costs increased in late 2017 and have further accelerated this year. We are implementing price increases (with our normal 90-day lag) in the majority of our steel-consuming businesses to recover the higher costs. In our Home Furniture business, where we have not yet been able to fully recover inflation because of offshore competition, we are also reducing our cost structure and moving additional production to our Chinese operations to take advantage of lower input costs.\n\"We raised our full year sales guidance to reflect continued steel inflation, and now anticipate 2018 sales growth of 9-12%. We expect the pricing lag associated with steel cost inflation to again pressure margins in the second quarter, and have lowered our full-year EPS guidance by $.05 to allow for this impact.\n\"We are maintaining our strong financial base. We ended the quarter with nearly $660 million available through our commercial paper program and expect to repatriate approximately $300 million of offshore cash primarily in the second half of this year. Net debt to net capital 1 was 38%, within our 30% ‑ 40% target range. Our debt increased modestly to 2.4 times our trailing 12-month adjusted 1 EBITDA, reflecting working capital investment, our typically higher level of first quarter stock repurchases, and increased acquisition activity.\n\"For a decade our primary financial goal has been to achieve Total Shareholder Return (TSR) that ranks within the top third of the S&P 500 over rolling three-year periods. Since 2008, our rolling 3-year TSR rank among the S&P 500 was in or very close to the top third six out of eight periods, and near the midpoint twice. For the three years that began January 1, 2016, we have so far (over the last 28 months) generated TSR of 3% annually, which ranks in the bottom third of the S&P 500. Notwithstanding, we continue to strongly believe our disciplined growth strategy and use of capital will support achievement of our top-third goal over time.\"\nDividends and Stock Repurchases\nIn February, Leggett & Platt's Board of Directors declared a $.36 first quarter dividend, two cents higher than last year's first quarter dividend. Thus, 2018 marks 47 consecutive annual dividend increases for the company, a record that only ten S&P 500 companies currently exceed. Leggett & Platt is proud of its dividend record and plans to extend it. At yesterday's closing share price of $41.83, the indicated annual dividend of $1.44 per share generates a dividend yield of 3.4%, one of the highest dividend yields among the 53 stocks of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats.\nDuring the first quarter the company purchased 1.2 million shares of its stock at an average price of $45.09, and issued .5 million shares through employee benefit plans and option exercises. The number of shares outstanding declined to 131.2 million, a .8% reduction over the last 12 months. For the full year, the company expects to repurchase a total of 2 to 3 million shares, and issue about 1 million shares, primarily for employee benefit plans.\n2018 Guidance\nFor 2018, the company continues to expect that sales growth will lead to improved earnings. Sales are now expected to be $4.3–$4.4 billion, an increase of 9–12% versus 2017, and $100 million above the prior range of $4.2–$4.3 billion due to continued steel inflation. Volume growth is expected to be in the mid-single digits, from strength in Automotive, Bedding, Adjustable Bed, Work Furniture, Aerospace, and Geo Components. Raw material-related price increases and currency impact should also contribute to sales growth. The PHC acquisition is expected to add 2% to sales.\nContinuing operations EPS is now expected to be $2.60–$2.80, a $.05 per share reduction from the prior range of $2.65-$2.85. This decrease is due to the impact from continued steel cost inflation and the pricing lag the company experiences in recovering higher costs. EPS guidance assumes an approximate 22% tax rate.\nBased upon this guidance range, 2018 EBIT margin should be 11.5–12.0%. Ongoing steel cost inflation is expected to again pressure margins during the second quarter. Assuming costs stabilize, margins should improve in the second half of the year.\nCash from operations is expected to approximate $450 million in 2018. Capital expenditures should be approximately $160 million, and dividend payments should approximate $195 million. The company's target for dividend payout is 50–60% of adjusted 1 earnings; payout for 2018 is expected to be near the midpoint of the target range.\nThe company's top priorities for use of cash remain organic growth, dividends, and strategic acquisitions. After funding those priorities, the company generally intends to repurchase its stock (rather than repay debt early or stockpile cash). Management has standing authorization from the Board of Directors to buy up to 10 million shares each year; however, no specific repurchase commitment or timetable has been established.\nLIFO\nApproximately 50% of Leggett's inventories are valued on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. These are primarily the company's domestic, steel-related inventories. Increasing steel costs since the beginning of 2018 resulted in a first quarter LIFO expense of $6.0 million (pretax). In the first quarter of 2017, LIFO expense was $.4 million (pretax).\nSEGMENT RESULTS – First Quarter 2018 (versus the same period in 2017)\nResidential Products – Total sales grew 2%, from a slight increase in same location sales and a small acquisition completed in 2017. Volume decreased 3%, from soft demand in Geo Components and Flooring Products (formerly Carpet Cushion), along with lower pass-thru sales of adjustable beds; however this was more than offset by a 4% benefit from raw material-related price increases and currency impact. EBIT decreased $8 million primarily due to higher raw material costs (including LIFO expense) and lower volume.\nIndustrial Products – Total sales grew 13%, primarily from raw material-related price increases. EBIT was essentially flat with improved metal margins at our steel rod mill offset by higher LIFO expense and other costs.\nFurniture Products – Total sales increased 5%. Same location sales increased 3% from raw material-related price increases and currency impact. Volume was essentially flat, with strong growth in Adjustable Bed offset by declines in Home Furniture and Fashion Bed. A small Work Furniture acquisition completed in 2017 also contributed to sales growth. EBIT decreased $2 million, primarily from higher steel costs in Home Furniture.\nSpecialized Products – Total sales increased 13%. Same location sales increased 11%, primarily from volume gains in Automotive and currency impact. The PHC acquisition completed at the end of January added 6% to sales growth, but last year's divestiture of CVP reduced sales by 4%. EBIT increased $3 million primarily from higher volume, partially offset by growth-related costs.\nSlides and Conference Call\nA set of slides containing summary financial information is available from the Investor Relations section of Leggett's website at www.leggett.com .
