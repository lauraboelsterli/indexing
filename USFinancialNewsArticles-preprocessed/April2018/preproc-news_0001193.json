REUTERS/Jason Lee/File Photo \n(graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2JbkC4i ) \nThe craft re-entered the atmosphere around 8:15 a.m. Beijing time (0015GMT/ 8.15 p.m ET) and the “vast majority” of it had burnt up upon re-entry, the authority said in a brief statement on its website. \nIt had said shortly before that it was expected to re-enter off the Brazilian coast in the South Atlantic near the cities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. \nThe United States Air Force 18th Space Control Squadron, which tracks and detects all artificial objects in earth’s orbit, said they had also tracked the Tiangong-1 as it re-entered the atmosphere over the South Pacific. \nIt said in a statement they had confirmed re-entry in coordination with counterparts in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea and Britain. \nBeijing said on Friday it was unlikely any large pieces would reach the ground. \nThe 10.4-metre-long (34.1-foot) Tiangong-1, or “Heavenly Palace 1”, was launched in 2011 to carry out docking and orbit experiments as part of China’s ambitious space program, which aims to place a permanent station in orbit by 2023. \nIt was originally planned to be decommissioned in 2013 but its mission was repeatedly extended. \nChina had said its re-entry would occur in late 2017 but that process was delayed, leading some experts to suggest the space laboratory was out of control. \nThe Chinese tabloid Global Times said on Monday worldwide media hype about the re-entry reflected overseas “envy” of China’s space industry. \n“It’s normal for spacecraft to re-enter the atmosphere, yet Tiangong-1 received so much attention partly because some Western countries are trying to hype and sling mud at China’s fast-growing aerospace industry,” it said.
