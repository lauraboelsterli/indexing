    "text": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - Motiva Enterprises [MOTIV.UL] will shut a small crude distillation unit over the weekend at the largest U.S. crude oil refinery, sources familiar with plant operations said on Wednesday.\nMotiva will shut the 80,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) VPS-2 crude distillation unit (CDU) at its 603,000-bpd Port Arthur, Texas, refinery as early as Friday, the sources said.\nMotiva spokeswoman Angela Goodwin declined to comment.\nVPS-2 will be shut for about a month of work, the sources said. Two sulfur recovery units will also be shut while VPS-2 is down.\nThis is the second time this year Motiva has shut a crude distillation unit at the Port Arthur refinery.\nMotiva shut the 325,000-bpd VPS-5 CDU was for a month-long overhaul between early February and early March.\nThe Port Arthur refineryâ€™s three CDUs do the primary refining of crude oil and provide hydrocarbon feedstock to all other units.\nDuring the work on VPS-2, Motiva may also change the catalyst on a hydrotreating unit, the sources said.\nReporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Lisa Shumaker\n ",
