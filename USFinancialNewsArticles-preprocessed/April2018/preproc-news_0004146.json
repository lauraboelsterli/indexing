Williams tallied 16 points and Jordan contributed eight points and 11 rebounds for the Clippers. The Blazers shot 55.3 percent in the first half and owned a 38-28 edge in points in the paint.\nLillard bombed in a long 3-pointer to give Portland a 71-51 lead early in the third quarter. The Clippers got within 81-64, but Portland took an 87-66 edge into the final period.\nThe Clippers opened the fourth quarter on a 14-5 run to close to within 92-80 with eight minutes remaining. The Clippers trimmed the difference to 100-89 on a pair of free throws by Boban Marjonovic with 2:56 to play.\nNurkic scored on a driving layup to make it 102-89 with 2:02 to go. Marjonovic followed with a bank shot to cut it to 102-91 with 1:44 left. Sam Dekker split a pair at the line to make it 102-92 with 1:17 to play, and Marjonovic dunked to get the Clippers within 102-94 with 53.3 seconds remaining.\nPat Connaughton’s 3-pointer with 29.8 seconds on the clock put the game on ice for the Blazers.\nAfter starting 0-for-6 from the field, Portland made 11 of its last 15 attempts in the first to take a 26-23 advantage into the second quarter.\nThe Clippers went ahead 30-28, but the Blazers used a 23-5 run to go in front 51-35. They settled for a 15-point advantage at the half.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
