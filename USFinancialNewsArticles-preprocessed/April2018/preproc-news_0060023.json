    "text": "NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., April 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Magyar Bancorp (NASDAQ: MGYR) (the \"Company\"), parent company of Magyar Bank, reported today the results of its operations for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018.\nThe Company reported net income of $396,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to net income of $300,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net income for the six months ended March 31, 2018 was $725,000 compared to net income of $648,000 for the six months ended March 31, 2017.\nThe net income per share was $0.07 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $0.05 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net income per share was $0.12 for the six months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $0.11 for the six months ended March 31, 2017.\n\"The second quarter of our fiscal year produced another strong performance for Magyar Bank,\" stated John Fitzgerald, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased 32% compared to the same period last year as a result of an increase in loans and recent interest rate hikes. This, along with the Bank's ability to manage our funding costs in a rising rate environment, led to a 10 basis point increase in our net interest margin for the three month period ending March 31, 2018 compared to March 31, 2017.\"\nMr. Fitzgerald added, \"We continue to see improvement in our levels of non-performing assets which declined 15% in the first six months of our fiscal year thanks to the sale of three properties during this time. With continued improvement in our core earnings and further reduction in our levels of non-performing assets, we expect earnings to continue to improve during the second half of our fiscal year.\"\nAbout Magyar Bancorp\nMagyar Bancorp is the parent company of Magyar Bank, a community bank headquartered in New Brunswick, New Jersey.
