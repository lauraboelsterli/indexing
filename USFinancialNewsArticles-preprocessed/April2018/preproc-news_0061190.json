    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin on Friday hailed a historic summit between the leaders of North and South Korea as very positive news and said President Vladimir Putin had long advocated direct talks between the two countries.\nThe Kremlin’s comments came after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in embraced after pledging on Friday to work for the “complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.”\nWhen asked about the prospect of U.S. President Donald Trump also meeting the North Korean leader, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call that Moscow welcomed any steps that would ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\nReporting by Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber; Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Maria Kiselyova\n ",
