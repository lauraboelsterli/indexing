    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that U.S. “smart missiles” should be aimed at terrorists, and not at the Syrian government, as it commented on U.S. President Donald Trump’s warning of a missile strike in Syria.\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova attends a news conference after a meeting of Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov with his Indonesian counterpart Retno Marsudi in Moscow, Russia March 13, 2018. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin “Smart missiles should fly towards terrorists, and not towards the lawful government which has been fighting international terrorism on its territory for several years,” Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, wrote on Facebook.\nTrump on Wednesday warned of a forthcoming response to suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria, declaring that “smart” missiles will be coming and blasting Moscow for standing by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\nZakharova said that a possible U.S. missile strike could be an attempt to destroy evidence of an alleged chemical weapon attack in the Syrian town of Douma.\nReporting by Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Christian Lowe\n ",
