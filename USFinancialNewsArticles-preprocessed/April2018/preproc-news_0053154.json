(“Edge Therapeutics” or the “Company”) (NASDAQGS: EDGE) violated federal securities laws.\nClick here to learn about the case: http://docs.wongesq.com/EDGE-Info-Request-Form-1889 . There is no cost or obligation to you.\nOn March 28, 2018, Edge Therapeutics disclosed “that a pre-specified interim analysis on data from the Day 90 visit of the first 210 subjects randomized and treated in the Phase 3 NEWTON 2 study of EG-1962 demonstrated a low probability of achieving a statistically-significant difference compared to the standard of care in the study’s primary endpoint, if the study is fully enrolled.” As a result, the Data Monitoring Committee “recommended that the study be stopped based on its conclusion that the study has a low probability of meeting its primary endpoint.” Based on the DMC recommendation, Edge Therapeutics decided to discontinue the Phase 3 NEWTON 2 study. Upon this news, shares of Edge Therapeutics fell from a close of $15.59 on March 27, 2018, to a close of $1.31 per share on March 28, 2018.\nTo learn more about the investigation of Edge Therapeutics contact Vincent Wong, Esq. either via email vw@wongesq.com , by telephone at 212.425.1140, or visit http://docs.wongesq.com/EDGE-Info-Request-Form-1889 .\nVincent Wong, Esq. is an experienced attorney that has represented investors in securities litigations involving financial fraud and violations of shareholder rights.
