    "text": "Jose Abreu walloped a tiebreaking homer to lead off the eighth inning to lift the Chicago White Sox to a 4-3 victory over the host Toronto Blue Jays on Wednesday at Rogers Centre.\nAbreu slammed a 3-0 pitch from right-hander Ryan Tepera (1-1) a booming 430 feet into the restaurant level above the left-center field fence to help Chicago end a two-game slide.\nNate Jones (1-0) got four outs and fellow right-hander Joakim Soria struck out two in a perfect ninth for his second save as the White Sox halted Toronto’s four-game winning streak.\nMatt Davidson also homered for Chicago, which leads the majors with 14.\nToronto right-hander Aaron Sanchez allowed three runs and five hits in six innings, striking out seven and walking two. White Sox right-hander Carson Fulmer gave up three runs, five hits and one walk while striking out five in five innings.\nThe White Sox pushed across two runs in the fifth with help from a review to take a 3-1 lead.\nThe bases were loaded with one out when Yoan Moncada sent a deep blast to the wall in left. Toronto’s Curtis Granderson leaped and the ball appear to either deflect off the wall or off Granderson’s glove.\nGranderson fell to the ground and the ball followed and landed in his glove for what was ruled to be the second out.\nHowever, on review, the ball was ruled to hit the top of the fence behind Granderson’s glove before he made the grab, and the play was ruled to be a run-scoring single for Moncada. Sanchez hit the following batter, Adam Engel, to force in another run and make it 3-1.\nThe Blue Jays tied the score in the bottom of the sixth on two run-scoring singles. Steve Pearce delivered a pinch hit to left for the first run and Kendrys Morales tied it with a liner to center.\nChicago opened the scoring in the second when Davidson lined a 3-1 pitch over the wall in left for his fourth homer of the campaign.\nRussell Martin’s grounder pushed across a run in the fourth as Toronto tied the score at 1.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
