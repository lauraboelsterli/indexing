    "text": "UPDATE 3-Samsung Elec flags mobile weakness as chips power record Q1 profit April 26, 2018\n* Q1 op profit $14.4 bln, tops Q4 as highest-ever\n* Warns of slower earnings growth due to weaker smartphone market\n* Shares jump on chip outlook\n* Chip business top earner on strong server demand (Adds exec comments on chip demand, ZTE ban, updates share price)\nSEOUL, April 26 (Reuters) – Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said weakness in the global smartphone market would slow earnings growth, as it reported record quarterly profit on Thursday thanks to strong demand for semiconductors used in servers.\nThe world’s biggest maker of memory chips, smartphones and television sets also flagged softer demand for smartphone OLED panels as a challenge for the second quarter, while its cash-cow chip business should remain strong.\n“Generating overall earnings growth across the company will be a challenge due to weakness in the display panel segment and a decline in profitability in the mobile business amid rising competition in the high-end segment,” the South Korean giant said in a statement.\nSamsung Electronics shares were up 2.7 percent as of 0412 GMT, while the KOSPI benchmark share price index was 1.3 percent higher, as investors shrugged off concerns about the smartphone market and seized on the outlook for memory chips.\n“Shares are rising as Samsung Electronics’ outlook for its memory chip business appears more positive than we’ve heard from other companies,” said Greg Roh, analyst at HMC Investment & Securities.\nSouth Korean rival SK Hynix Inc and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) separately warned this month of slower growth in smartphone chip sales. TSMC, a key supplier for Apple Inc’s iPhones, cut its revenue target last week.

Revenue jumped 19.8 percent to 60.6 trillion won, also in line with its estimate.\nCHIPS UPSIDE\nThe chip business was Samsung’s top earner again as it booked a record 11.6 trillion won operating profit in January-March, from 10.9 trillion won in the previous quarter, despite signs the recent boom in memory chips was tapering off.\nSamsung hinted at further potential upside after the United States banned U.S. firms from doing business with Chinese mobile phone and telecommunications equipment maker ZTE Corp .\nZTE would be forced to look elsewhere for mobile chips if top supplier Qualcomm Inc is locked out by the U.S. ban.\nBen Hur, vice president of Samsung’s System LSI business, which competes with Qualcomm, said Samsung would “actively respond” to new clients when he was asked by analysts if the ban would help Samsung’s chip sales in China.\nSamsung said its mobile business booked 3.8 trillion won in quarterly profit, up 82 percent from a year ago. Its flagship Galaxy S9 smartphone hit the market in mid-March.

Demand was especially sluggish in China and North America, it said.\nHowever, the average sales price grew 21 percent year-on-year in the quarter, leading to an 18 percent rise in global smartphone revenue to $129.8 billion.
