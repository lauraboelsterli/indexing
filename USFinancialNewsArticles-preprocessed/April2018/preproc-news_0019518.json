It was headed for its third session of losses versus its Japanese peer.\n“We are still at a stage of trade tensions where the United States and China are exchanging threats. Algo-driven accounts react to each development and stir the equity market, in turn impact currencies,” said Yukio Ishizuki, senior currency strategist at Daiwa Securities.\n“Geopolitical risks are also weighing on the dollar against the yen, on concerns that U.S.-Russia relations could worsen over the Syria issue,” Ishizuki said.\nU.S. President Trump on Monday promised quick, forceful action in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria, appearing to suggest a potential military response. Trump has castigated Russia for backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\nThe euro was steady at $1.2324 after rising about 0.35 percent the previous day, when it touched a six-day high of $1.2331.\nThe common currency was lifted after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on Monday that the slide in stock markets this year has not materially impacted euro zone financial conditions, suggesting policymakers remain calm about the recent market volatility.\nThe dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was little changed at 89.829 after shedding 0.3 percent on Monday.\nThe Canadian dollar hovered near a six-week peak reached against the dollar overnight on higher oil prices and a business survey from the Bank of Canada that supported expectations for further interest rate hikes.\nThe loonie was steady at C$1.2703 per dollar and in close reach of C$1.2687, its strongest since Feb. 27 set on Monday.\nThe Australian dollar, another commodity-linked currency, was a shade higher at $0.7699 after advancing about 0.3 percent overnight.
