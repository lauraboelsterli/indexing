    "text": "Billionaire investor Carl Icahn says he hasn't spoken with President Donald Trump for months.\nIn a letter published Tuesday in The Washington Post , Icahn said he was concerned about the newspaper's characterization of his relationship with the president in a recent article.\n\"The article seemed to imply that I've been speaking regularly with the president,\" he said. \"I'd like to set the record straight: Neither I nor anyone in my office has spoken with the president or any high-level member of the Trump administration, including Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt , regarding government business since August.\"\nIcahn resigned from his post as special advisor on regulation to Trump last year, ahead of a critical New Yorker magazine article describing his potential conflicts of interest.\nIn the letter to the editor, Icahn reiterated that his White House departure stemmed from his distaste for partisan backbiting.\n\"While I agree with many of the things his administration has done, I do disagree with others,\" Icahn wrote. \"I simply found the constant drumbeat of vitriol and rhetoric in Washington — on both sides of the aisle — to be distasteful and a distraction from my busy schedule.\"\n\"Washington is not for me,\" Icahn added.\nRead Icahn's full letter to The Washington Post here.",
