    "text": "Net Income Increased 35% to $166 Million; Return on Equity of 12.3%\nGREENWICH, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nW. R. Berkley Corporation (NYSE:WRB) today reported net income of $166 million, or $1.30 per share.\nSummary Financial Data (Amounts in thousands, except per share data) First Quarter 2018 2017 Gross premiums written $ 1,979,421 $ 1,936,207 Net premiums written 1,665,338 1,646,838 Net income to common stockholders 166,396 123,447 Net income per diluted share 1.30 0.96 Return on equity (1) 12.3 % 9.8 % (1) Return on equity represents net income expressed on an annualized basis as a percentage of beginning of year stockholders’ equity. First quarter highlights included:\nWe reported annualized pre-tax return on equity of 15.5%, which adjusted for accounting changes for equity securities effective January 1, 2018 would have been 22.5%. The combined ratio was 94.6%, inclusive of 0.5 loss ratio points from catastrophes and an additional 0.7 loss ratio points from non-catastrophe weather. Total catastrophe losses were $7 million. Investment income increased 17.2%. Investment income attributable to the core investment portfolio increased 11.3% (1) . Net realized pre-tax gains and net unrealized pre-tax gains on equity securities of $44 million, net of performance-based compensatory costs (2) .\nThe Company commented:\nOur performance was strong, resulting from our ongoing strategy to minimize volatility in our underwriting results, combined with robust investment income. Our 12.3% annualized ROE is a reflection of our focus on delivering superior risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders.\nNet premiums written in the Insurance segment grew by 3.3% in the quarter, with steady price improvement in each month. This growth was partially offset by a decline of 20% in net premiums written in the Reinsurance segment, where the pricing environment remained exceptionally competitive. Similar to others, we experienced a higher level of non-catastrophe weather-related property losses in the quarter. However, the net impact of catastrophe losses was relatively modest, and our accident year loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses was stable. We remain optimistic that slow but steady improvements in pricing, along with growth in the economy benefiting from recent tax reform, will enable our underwriting results to improve.\nNet investment income was particularly strong this quarter as investment funds performed notably well. Investment funds have wide variations in income from quarter to quarter, but they continue to provide us with an enhanced overall long-term return. Recurring income from the core portfolio grew primarily due to an increase in invested assets. We realized gains on sales of investments of $142 million, before consideration of the change in accounting for unrealized gains on equity securities.\nOur first quarter results have provided a solid start to the year. The market is slowly moving in the right direction, and we anticipate that these trends, and consequently our results, will improve further during the remainder of the year. Changes in the tax code and accounting rules have made it more challenging to compare our current results with prior periods. We remain focused on creating shareholder value over the long-term.\n(1) Core portfolio includes fixed maturity securities, equity securities, cash and cash equivalents, real estate and loans receivable. (2) Net realized pre-tax gains and net unrealized pre-tax gains on equity securities before performance-based compensatory costs were $48 million.
