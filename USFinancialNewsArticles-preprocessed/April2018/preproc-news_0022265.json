    "text": "HELSINKI (Reuters) - “Angry Birds” maker Rovio, whose share price has nosedived since a sharp profit warning in February, said on Wednesday that its head of communications and investor relations was leaving the company after less than a year in the job.\nRovio said Rauno Heinonen, senior vice president of communications and investor relations and a member of the company’s leadership team, would leave immediately.\nHe is the second senior executive to leave the Finnish mobile game company in recent months after head of games Wilhelm Taht departed in February.\nHeinonen joined the company last September, helping the company to carry out an oversubscribed initial public offering.\nRovio spokeswoman gave no reasons for his departure but said it did not have to do with the company’s recent communications challenges.\nInvestor sentiment in Rovio has deteriorated this year, with Rovio’s share price plunging 50 percent in February after the company said its sales could fall this year after jumping 55 percent in 2017.\nRovio cited tough competition in the game industry, which also led to high marketing costs. A week after the profit warning, the company said Taht would leave Rovio immediately for personal reasons.\nHeinonen was not immediately available for a comment.\nRovio will hold its first annual general meeting on April 16.\nReporting by Jussi Rosendahl; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ",
