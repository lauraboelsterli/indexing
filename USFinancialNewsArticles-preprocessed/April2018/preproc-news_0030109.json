    "text": "April 16, 2018 / 7:35 PM / Updated 18 minutes ago White House cyber czar to leave, return to NSA - spokesman Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House cyber security coordinator Rob Joyce will leave his post and return to the National Security Agency, a White House spokesman said on Monday. \n“Joyce is three months past his detail of a year and is deciding to return to NSA,” a National Security Council spokesman said. \nHis departure follows that of his boss, Tom Bossert, who oversaw Joyce’s work on cyber security and was pushed out of the administration last week. \nAnother senior U.S. official said Joyce was leaving the White House of his own volition and not being forced out by President Donald Trump’s new national security adviser, John Bolton, or other personnel. \nIt was not immediately clear when Joyce would leave the White House. \nJoyce was well respected by cyber security experts and widely credited with steering the Trump administration toward trying to impose harsher penalties on foreign adversaries in response to cyber attacks. \nThe announcement of his departure came just hours after he and other U.S. and UK officials briefed reporters on a global cyber attack targeting routers and other networking equipment. They blamed Russian government-backed hackers for the campaign against government agencies, businesses and critical infrastructure operators.
