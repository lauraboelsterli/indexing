    "text": "EMLENTON, Pa., April 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Emclaire Financial Corp (NASDAQ:EMCF), the parent holding company of The Farmers National Bank of Emlenton, reported consolidated net income of $1.4 million, or $0.60 per common share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $406,000, or 42.5%, from $956,000, or $0.44 per common share, reported for the same period in 2017.\nThe increase in net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 resulted from increases in net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by increases in the provision for loan losses and noninterest expense. The Corporation realized an annualized return on average assets of 0.74% and an annualized return on average equity of 9.38% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to 0.56% and 7.12%, respectively, for the same period in 2017.\nWilliam C. Marsh, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation and the Bank, noted, “The Board of Directors, management and I are pleased to report strong earnings for the first quarter of 2018. We continue to experience sound loan and deposit growth while managing expenses and maintaining strong asset quality. We remain focused on sustaining a sound capital base while providing an attractive return to our shareholders and are well-positioned for future profitable growth.”\nOPERATING RESULTS OVERVIEW\nNet income increased $406,000, or 42.5%, to $1.4 million, or $0.60 per common share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $956,000, or $0.44 per common share, for the same period in 2017. The increase resulted from increases in net interest income and noninterest income of $689,000 and $43,000, respectively, partially offset by increases in the provision for loan losses and noninterest expense of $218,000 and $115,000, respectively.\nNet interest income increased $689,000, or 13.4%, to $5.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $5.2 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in net interest income resulted from an increase in interest income of $822,000, or 13.3%, as the Corporation experienced a $50.0 million increase in the average balance of loans. Partially offsetting the increase in interest income, interest expense increased $133,000, or 13.1%, as the Corporation's average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased $67.0 million, partially offset by a $20.1 million decrease in the average balance of borrowed funds. The increases in the Corporation's loans and interest-bearing deposit balances resulted from strong production across the Bank's franchise and the third quarter 2017 acquisition of Northern Hancock Bank and Trust Co. (NHBT) which added approximately $18.5 million in loans and $19.7 million in deposits to the Bank.\nNoninterest income increased $43,000, or 5.0%, to $899,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $856,000 for the same period in 2017. Fees and service charges increased $29,000 as overdraft charges for the three month ended March 31, 2018 outpaced the same period in the prior year and other income increased $29,000 due to increased interchange fee income.\nThe provision for loan losses increased $218,000, or 134.6%, to $380,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $162,000 for the same period in 2017 due to general increases in the Corporation's loan portfolio and higher than normal loan charge-offs experienced in the first quarter of 2018.\nNoninterest expense increased $115,000, or 2.5%, to $4.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $4.6 million for the same period in 2017. The increase primarily related to increases in compensation and benefits expense and federal deposit insurance of $130,000 and $29,000, respectively. The increase in compensation and benefits expense related to costs associated with the operation of the new full-service banking office in Chester, West Virginia which was acquired from NHBT, increased health insurance costs and normal salary and benefit increases.\nThe provision for income taxes decreased $7,000, or 2.6%, to $266,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $273,000 million for the same period in 2017. The Corporation estimates that tax savings realized as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the decrease in the corporate tax rate to 21% were approximately $175,000.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET & ASSET QUALITY OVERVIEW\nTotal assets increased $5.7 million to $755.8 million at March 31, 2018 from $750.1 million at December 31, 2017. Asset growth was driven by increases in net loans receivable and cash and equivalents of $6.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in investment securities of $4.3 million. Liabilities increased $5.9 million to $696.9 million at March 31, 2018 from $691.0 million at December 31, 2017 due to an increase in customer deposits of $12.1 million, partially offset by a $5.7 million reduction in borrowed funds.\nTotal nonperforming assets decreased to $4.0 million, or 0.53% of total assets at March 31, 2018, compared to $4.2 million, or 0.56% of total assets at December 31, 2017.\nStockholders’ equity decreased $214,000 to $58.9 million at March 31, 2018 from $59.1 million at December 31, 2017 primarily due to a $1.2 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by a $912,000 increase in retained earnings as a result of $1.4 million of net income, partially offset by $635,000 of common dividends paid. The Corporation remains well capitalized and is positioned for continued growth with total stockholders’ equity at 7.8% of total assets. Tangible book value per common share was $21.21 at March 31, 2018, compared to $21.28 at December 31, 2017.\nEmclaire Financial Corp is the parent company of The Farmers National Bank of Emlenton, an independent, nationally chartered, FDIC-insured community bank headquartered in Emlenton, Pennsylvania, operating 17 full service banking offices in Venango, Allegheny, Butler, Clarion, Clearfield, Crawford, Elk, Jefferson and Mercer counties, Pennsylvania and Hancock County, West Virginia.
