    "text": "President Donald Trump is calling for new border wall and immigration legislation, tweeting that moving to the \"nuclear option\" in the Senate is only way to muscle such a measure through Congress. But that would require changing Senate rules, something for which Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has shown no enthusiasm.\nIn early morning tweets Monday, Trump says \"Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation, use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People.\" He added, \"Act now, Congress, our country is being stolen.\"\nDonald Trump tweet 1\nTrump also tweeted that the U.S. must build a border wall, but argued that \"Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crime!\" He also said that a deal to help \"Dreamer\" immigrants is \"dead because the Democrats didn't care or act.\"\nDonald Trump tweet 2\nDonald Trump tweet 3\nThe $1.3 trillion funding package Congress passed last month included $1.6 billion in border wall spending. But much of that money can only be used to repair existing segments, not build new sections. Congress also put restrictions on the types of barriers that can be built.",
