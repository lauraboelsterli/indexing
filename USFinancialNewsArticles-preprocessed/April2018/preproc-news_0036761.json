    "text": "LA JOLLA, Calif., April 17, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Regulus Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: RGLS), a biopharmaceutical company leading the discovery and development of innovative medicines targeting microRNAs, today announced Kathryn J. Collier has joined the Company's board of directors. She will be a member of the Company's Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Audit Committee.\n\"We are pleased to add Kate to the Regulus board. She brings a depth of experience that we believe will add significant value to our board and Company,\" said Stelios Papadopoulos, Ph.D., Chairman of the Board of Directors of Regulus.\n\"I am honored to join the Regulus board and look forward to bringing my strategic, financial, and operational experience and expertise to serve Regulus' board and management,\" said Kate Collier.\nMs. Collier is currently vice president and treasurer for Sempra Energy, a San Diego-based Fortune 500 energy services holding company. Prior to joining Sempra in 2012, Ms. Collier spent 17 years at Bank of America Merrill Lynch where she held several executive positions within global corporate and investment banking. Ms. Collier serves on the boards of two Sempra-owned South American electric utilities. She holds a bachelor's degree in accounting from Valparaiso University.\nAbout microRNAs\nThe discovery of microRNAs in humans during the last decade is one of the most exciting scientific breakthroughs in recent history. microRNAs are small RNA molecules, typically 20 to 25 nucleotides in length, that do not encode proteins but instead regulate gene expression. More than 800 microRNAs have been identified in the human genome, and over two-thirds of all human genes are believed to be regulated by microRNAs. A single microRNA can regulate entire networks of genes. As such, these molecules are considered master regulators of the human genome. microRNA expression, or function, has been shown to be significantly altered or dysregulated in many disease states, including oncology, fibrosis, metabolic diseases, immune-inflammatory diseases and HCV. Targeting microRNAs with anti-miRs, chemically modified, single-stranded oligonucleotides, offers a unique approach to treating disease by modulating entire biological pathways and may become a new and major class of drugs with broad therapeutic application.\nAbout Regulus\nRegulus Therapeutics Inc. (Nasdaq: RGLS) is a biopharmaceutical company leading the discovery and development of innovative medicines targeting microRNAs. Regulus has leveraged its oligonucleotide drug discovery and development expertise to develop a well-balanced microRNA therapeutics pipeline complemented by a rich intellectual property estate to retain its leadership in the microRNA field. Regulus is advancing several programs in renal, hepatic and central nervous systems diseases, both independently and with our strategic alliance partners, Sanofi and AstraZeneca. Regulus maintains its corporate headquarters in La Jolla, CA.
