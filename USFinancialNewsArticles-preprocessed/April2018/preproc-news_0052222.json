QG was appointed in 2012, with most investments made in 2015.\n“FSDEA has great concerns about Quantum Global’s approach to investment of the FSDEA funds, as it believes that is not fully aligned with the principles for which the FSDEA was established,” it said in a statement.\n“As a consequence of investigations through leading international global consultants and advisers, FSDEA is taking steps to remove Quantum as its asset manager,” it added.\nQuantum Global said any moves could result in losses from the investments.\n“Any hasty move to withdraw these funds or wind down the funds would run counter to existing contractual arrangements and would lead to a significant loss of value because many of these projects are in the early phase of development,” it said in a statement.\nThe Zurich-based firm said it looked forward to resolving the situation with the FSDEA in an amicable manner.\nSince he succeeded longtime leader Jose Eduardo dos Santos last September, President Joao Lourenco has Lourenço has moved against a number of dos Santos allies and removed family members from key positions.\nThey include his daughter Isabel from the state oil company Sonangol and his son José Filomeno from the sovereign wealth fund.\nFriday’s announcement comes just weeks after Mauritius froze bank accounts and suspended business licences linked to QG Investments Africa Management following a visit by Angolan officials.\nQG Investments Africa Management, which said it was cooperating with authorities in Mauritius, is run by Jean-Claude Bastos de Morais, QG founder and group chairman and a business partner of Jose Filomeno dos Santos.\nQuantum Global has demanded that Mauritius authorities explain their decision to suspend its business licenses on the Indian Ocean island nation.
