Unpaid refunds from those returns total more than $1 billion, according to the Internal Revenue Service. The median refund is $847.\nThe deadline for filing late returns for 2014 is April 17. If you miss that deadline, any money that would have been refunded to you goes to the U.S. Treasury.\nYou may also be eligible for the earned income tax credit if you had low or moderate income. That credit was valued at up to $6,143 in 2014, according to the IRS.\nshow chapters Hereâ€™s why that tax refund might not be a good thing      2:19 PM ET Fri, 6 April 2018 | 00:52 Watch out for reasons that could prevent you from collecting your refund money.\nIf you have not filed tax returns for 2015 or 2016, your refund for 2014 may be held by the IRS.\nPlus, your refund money could be used to pay debts owed to the IRS or state tax agency, such as unpaid child support or student loans.\nHere are the states with the highest total potential refunds, excluding the earned income tax credit.\nState-by-state estimates of 2014 income tax refunds State or District Estimated Number of Individuals Median Potential Refund Total Potential Refunds Texas 108,100 $899 $121,956,100 California 93,600 $785 $95,745,100 Florida 69,800 $865 $74,040,300 New York 53,600 $913 $60,135,600 Illinois 39,500 $895 $43,600,000 Pennsylvania 39,300 $907 $42,866,100 Ohio 38,100 $826 $38,956,700 Michigan 34,100 $845 $36,505,700 Georgia 34,800 $772 $35,006,000 New Jersey 28,600 $928 $32,452,500 Source: Internal Revenue Service More from Investor Toolkit: \nThe wrong investments are sabotaging your retirement plans \nHere's how to maximize those retirement 'sweet spot' years \nHere's how an investor can take advantage of market volatility",
