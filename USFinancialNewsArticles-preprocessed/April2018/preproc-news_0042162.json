    "text": "Final Agreement to Provide New Offices and New Production Studios\nBeverly Hills, Calif., April 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MC Endeavors, Inc. ( MSMY ), an innovator in social commerce platforms, is committed to becoming a leading global social commerce company that utilizes a single core platform, Room 21™, to produce, distribute and monetize online communities for individuals and businesses that interact with industries ranging from industrial business to healthcare to entertainment.\nManagement is proud to announce that the company officially entered into negotiations to acquire its own network studio production facility in Laguna Hills, CA. Mr. Stippick, CEO, states “We are a digital media company and with this studio agreement, our company will save months of valuable time and millions of dollars in equipment. Given our wide range of capabilities, it is natural for MC Endeavors/Room 21 Media to acquire its own studios, production teams, copy writers, and editors to create its own content for TheShare.TV and to produce commercials, infomercials, and video educational content for our clients with greater profitability and quality. Given that all social platforms such as Facebook, SnapChat, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Google Plus utilize both live video and taped broadcast, this is a strategic decision that will powerfully enable our company to become a major content producer. Finally, given that TheShare.TV is a wholly owned subsidiary with its own revenues, contracts, and cost centers, management felt that Room 21 Media needed to own its own studios to ensure that Production agreements generated by TheShare.TV would be awarded to the parent company at a comparable price and quality as if delivered by the larger studios. This ensures that monies generated by TheShare.TV can and will be spent with Room 21 Media studios providing production.”\nOur management will be releasing finalized information regarding the final terms of this agreement and additional distribution partners with the anticipated revenue streams for MC Endeavors, Inc./Room 21 Media.\nFor further information contact:\nJohn Stippick\nCEO\nMC Endeavors, Inc/Room 21 Media\nPhone: (310) 986-6373\nE-mail: johns@room21media.com\nSafe Harbor Statement - In addition to historical information, this press release may contain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
