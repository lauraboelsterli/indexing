    "text": "HAMILTON, Bermuda, April 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Till Capital Ltd. (Nasdaq:TIL) (TSX.V:TIL) (the “ Company ” or “ Till ”), announces that the TSX Venture Exchange (the “TSX.V”) has accepted the Company’s notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid (“ NCIB ”).\nUnder the new NCIB, Till Capital intends to bid for up to 246,240 common shares, representing 10% of the 2,462,425 shares forming Till's public float. As at March 31, 2018, there were 3,290,884 shares of Till outstanding.\nThe board of directors of the Company believes that the current and recent market prices for the Company's common shares do not give full effect to their underlying value and that, accordingly, the purchase of common shares under the NCIB will increase the proportionate share interest of, and be advantageous to, all remaining shareholders. The Company also believes the NCIB purchases will provide increased liquidity to current shareholders who would like to sell their shares. Purchased shares will be returned to treasury and cancelled. The bid will commence no earlier than three trading days following receipt of approval of the TSXV and will terminate one year from such date, or such earlier time as the applicable bid is completed or at the option of the Company. Purchases subject to the bid will be carried out pursuant to open market transactions through the facilities of the “TSX.V” by Canaccord Genuity on behalf of Till.\nUnder a prior normal course issuer bid, which commenced on December 7, 2016 and expired on December 6, 2017, Till purchased 59,400 common shares through open market purchases, all of which have been returned to treasury.\nReported by:\nJohn T. Rickard\nDirector and Chief Executive Officer\n(208) 635-5415\nTill Capital Ltd.\nTill Capital Ltd. is a Bermuda-domiciled company with two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Omega Insurance Holdings Inc. and Resource Re Ltd.

However, if any one shareholder of Till Capital beneficially owns, or exercises control or direction over, more than 50% of the issued and outstanding Till Capital shares, the 9.9% Restriction will cease to apply to the Till Capital shares.\nThis news release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities of Till Capital or any other securities, and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful. Trading in the securities of Till Capital should be considered speculative.\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulatory Service Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) nor the Bermuda Monetary Authority accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information\nExcept for statements of historical fact, this news release may contain certain “forward-looking information” within the meaning of applicable securities laws.
