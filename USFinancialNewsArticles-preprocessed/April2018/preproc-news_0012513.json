FILE PHOTO: A man covers his head as he crosses a road during heavy rain in Kolkata, India, July 7, 2017. REUTERS/Rupak De Chowdhuri/File photo \nMonsoon rains are expected to be 100 percent of the long-term average, Skymet said in a Tweet. \nIndia defines average, or normal, rainfall as between 96 percent and 104 percent of a 50-year average of 89 cm for the entire four-month season beginning June. \nThe state-run India Meteorological Department will come out with its monsoon forecast in mid-April.
