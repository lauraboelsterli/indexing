    "text": "AUGUSTA, Ga. (Reuters) - A heavyweight group of golfing royalty lurked on the fringes of contention after 54 holes at the U.S. Masters, all aware that nothing less than final-round perfection on Sunday would give them a chance of donning the Green Jacket.\nHenrik Stenson of Sweden watches his sand trap shot go in the hole on the 7th for a birdie during third round play of the 2018 Masters golf tournament at the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, U.S. April 7, 2018. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Henrik Stenson, a distant seven strokes behind leader Patrick Reed (14-under), probably best summed up the hopes of the chasing pack at Augusta National.\n“I think I’m a bit too far back,” the 2016 British Open champion told reporters after battling his long game for a hard-fought two-under 70.\nOne stroke further back, Bubba Watson and Marc Leishman were marginally more upbeat.\n“We’re playing a great golf tournament,” said two-times Masters champion Watson, whose game clicked into gear late in the first round on Thursday.\nLeishman started the third round two strokes behind halfway leader Reed, but a birdie-free 73 all but ended his chances.\n“I hit it well enough to hit a really good score, but it just wasn’t to be,” the Australian lamented. “Putts just weren’t going in.”\nThe eight strokes Jack Burke (1956) and Gary Player (1978) overcame remain the largest final-round deficits ever wiped out to win the Masters, so at least Watson, Leishman and Tommy Fleetwood can draw some slight inspiration from history.\nMarc Leishman of Australia looks over the 14th green with his putter leaning on his mouth during third round play of the 2018 Masters golf tournament at the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, U.S. April 7, 2018. REUTERS/Brian Snyder However, Justin Thomas and Jordan Spieth will have to do the unprecedented and rally from nine back.\nThomas needs a minor miracle to make it back-to-back major victories after his PGA Championship triumph last August.\n“Putter just didn’t feel good in my hands again today,” he said.\nSpieth, meanwhile, has never been so far adrift starting the final round in his previous four starts at Augusta.\n“I’m not down. I get to go out for one of my only stress-free rounds that I’ve ever played at Augusta National,” said the 2015 champion, who also finished second in 2014 and 2016.\nBut with 22 of the past 27 winners coming from the final Sunday pairing, the odds are that either American Reed or second-placed Briton Rory McIlroy, three off the lead, will slip on the Green Jacket in Butler Cabin.\nSpieth seemed to acknowledge as much.\n“Patrick, I think he’s come in here with the mentality that he’s fully capable of winning here, and he’s proving what he is capable of doing here,” the American added. “It’s going to be a pretty cool showdown with Rory tomorrow.”\nReporting by Andrew Both; Editing by John O'Brien\n ",
