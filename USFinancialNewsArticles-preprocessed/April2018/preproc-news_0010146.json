    "text": "ALHAMBRA, Calif., April 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EMCORE Corporation (NASDAQ:EMKR), a leading provider of advanced Mixed-Signal Optics products that provide the foundation for today's high-speed communications network infrastructures and leading-edge defense systems, today announced preliminary financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nEMCORE expects its revenues for the quarter to be approximately $18M to $19M compared to its previous revenue guidance for the quarter of a range of $21M to $23M. Certain principal factors that contributed to the lower than expected revenues in the quarter ended March 31, 2018 include:\nImpact of a major CATV customer working through a large inventory accumulation was greater than anticipated, resulting in lower than expected revenues from the customer during the quarter. Although other CATV customers showed strong demand in the quarter, a portion of the orders were received too late to ship before the end of Q2.\nJeffrey Rittichier, EMCORE's President and CEO commented, “CATV experienced significant demand shortfall from one major customer but saw bright spots in terms of LEML adoption and strength from our other customers. During the quarter, our Chip and Navigation businesses performed well and demonstrated the expected strength in demand.”\nThese preliminary, unaudited results are based on the most current information available to management following its initial review of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and remain subject to completion of EMCORE's customary closing procedures, including external auditor review.\nAbout EMCORE\nEMCORE Corporation is a leading provider of advanced Mixed-Signal Optics products that provide the foundation for today’s high-speed communication network infrastructures and leading-edge defense systems.
