    "text": "Russell Martin hit a go-ahead, two-run home run in the seventh inning, and the Toronto Blue Jays held on for a 4-2 win over the visiting Chicago White Sox on Monday night at Rogers Centre.\nJosh Donaldson and Aledmys Diaz also homered for Toronto, which improved to 3-2 on its opening homestand.\nWelington Castillo homered twice in a losing effort as Chicago took its first loss in three games this season.\nMartin put the Blue Jays on top 3-2 with a two-run shot over the left field wall off right-handed reliever Danny Farquhar (1-1). The blast marked the first home run of the season for Martin, who clubbed 13 homers in 91 games in 2017.\nDiaz added a home run off Farquhar in the eighth to make it a two-run lead for Toronto.\nToronto’s comeback spoiled a strong outing by White Sox right-hander Reynaldo Lopez, who carried a no-hitter into the fifth. Curtis Granderson broke up the no-hit bid on an infield single that shortstop Tim Anderson failed to corral.\nLopez yielded one run on two hits in six innings. He walked two and fanned six.\nBlue Jays right-hander Seung Hwan Oh (1-0) earned the victory despite surrendering a solo shot in one inning of relief. Oh followed left-hander Jaime Garcia, who allowed one run in six innings in his Toronto debut.\nToronto closer Roberto Osuna pitched a scoreless ninth for his second save.\nChicago opened the scoring on a solo home run by Castillo in the fourth. On a 2-1 pitch, the journeyman catcher belted a 409-foot shot over the left-center-field wall for his first home run with the White Sox.\nToronto evened the score at 1 on a blast by Donaldson in the sixth. He tracked a fastball on the outside corner and lofted an opposite-field shot to right field for his first home run.\nDonaldson stared into the White Sox dugout and mock-whistled as he crossed home plate. The gesture reportedly was aimed at Chicago first base coach Daryl Boston, who blows a whistle when his team makes good plays on defense. Boston chuckled at Donaldson’s home run celebration.\nCastillo struck again in the seventh to give Chicago a 2-1 lead. His 389-foot blast marked his sixth career multi-homer game.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
