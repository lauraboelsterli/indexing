    "text": "(New throughout; updates prices to close)\nTORONTO, April 16 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index rose on Monday, led by industrial and financial shares, as fears waned of an escalating conflict in Syria following the weekend’s U.S.-led air strikes.\n* The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index closed up 26.41 points, or 0.17 percent, at 15,300.38. It was the third straight day that the index has ended modestly higher.\n* Gains for the TSX came as investors on Wall Street turned their focus to earnings season and appeared less worried about the Middle East.\n* Industrials rose 0.8 percent, including gains for railroad shares. The financials group, which accounts for more than one-third of the weight of the TSX, gained 0.2 percent.\n* Eight of the index’s 10 main groups rose.\n* The energy group fell 1.7 percent as oil prices declined.\n* U.S. crude oil futures settled 1.7 percent lower at $66.22 a barrel.\n* The largest percentage gainer on the TSX was Aphria Inc , which rose 7.4 percent, while the largest decliner was Enerflex Ltd, down 6.9 percent.\n* The TSX posted four new 52-week highs and four new lows.
