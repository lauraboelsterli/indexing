    "text": "VANCOUVER, April 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - SSR Mining Inc. (NASDAQ: SSRM) (TSX: SSRM) (\"SSR Mining\") reports first quarter 2018 operating results at our three mines.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operating Highlights\nProduction in line with guidance at Marigold: Produced 42,960 ounces of gold and stacked a near-record 7.1 million tonnes of ore during the quarter.\nRecord quarterly throughput at Seabee: Achieved record mill throughput of 93,269 tonnes, or 1,036 tonnes per day, for 23,717 ounces of gold production.\nSolid quarterly production at Puna Operations: Produced 0.9 million ounces of silver as performance from stockpiles continued to exceed expectations.\nPaul Benson, President and CEO said, \"Each of our operations performed well during the quarter. Particularly pleasing was the continued increase in mill throughput at Seabee where our ongoing Operational Excellence initiatives have seen mill throughput and gold production continue to rise since we acquired the mine in 2016.\"\nMarigold Mine, U.S.\nQ1 2018\nQ4 2017\n% Change (1)\nTotal material mined\nkt\n16,150\n13,979\n15.5%\nWaste removed\nkt\n9,052\n8,136\n11.3%\nOre to leach pad\nkt\n7,099\n5,843\n21.5%\nStrip ratio\nw/o\n1.3\n1.4\n(7.1%)\nGold grade to leach pad\ng/t\n0.37\n0.37\n0.0%\nGold recovery\n%\n74%\n74%\n0.0%\nGold produced\noz\n42,960\n52,768\n(18.6%)\nGold sold\noz\n42,078\n51,420\n(18.2%)\nNotes:\n(1)\nPercent changes are calculated using rounded numbers presented in the table.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Marigold mine produced 42,960 ounces of gold, in line with guidance expectations. Production was 19% less than the previous quarter, due to lower ore stacked in the fourth quarter of 2017. Gold sales totaled 42,078 ounces for the quarter.\nDuring the quarter, 16.2 million tonnes of material were mined, 16% more than the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting an increase in operating days for the quarter due to a resumption of normal mining activities. We expect quarterly material movement to increase in the second quarter of 2018, and further in the second half of the year as four additional haul trucks are added to the fleet. Approximately 7.1 million tonnes of ore were delivered to the heap leach pads at an average gold grade of 0.37 g/t. This compares to 5.8 million tonnes of ore delivered to the heap leach pads at a gold grade of 0.37 g/t in the fourth quarter of 2017. The strip ratio was 1.3:1 for the quarter, a 7% decrease compared to the previous quarter.\nSeabee Gold Operation, Canada\nQ1 2018\nQ4 2017\n% Change (1)\nTotal ore milled\nt\n93,269\n89,237\n4.5%\nOre milled per day\nt/day\n1,036\n970\n6.8%\nGold mill feed grade\ng/t\n8.95\n8.89\n0.7%\nGold recovery\n%\n97.4%\n97.4%\n0.0%\nGold produced\noz\n23,717\n24,227\n(2.1%)\nGold sold (2)\noz\n20,012\n23,969\n(16.5%)\nNotes:\n(1)\nPercent changes are calculated using rounded numbers presented in the table.\n(2)\nBeginning with the first quarter of 2018, the holder of a 3% net smelter returns royalty elected to receive its royalty in-kind and we will no longer report these ounces within gold sold.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, Seabee Gold Operation produced 23,717 ounces of gold. With the commissioning of the new gravity circuit at the end of the quarter, in circuit gold inventory increased by approximately 2,400 ounces of gold, which is expected to positively impact gold production through the remainder of 2018. Gold sales were 20,012 ounces, lower than gold production due to bullion inventory increasing relative to the previous quarter.\nDuring the first quarter, total ore milled increased 5% over the previous quarter, with the Santoy mine supplying 73% of ore milled. Following an extensive underground exploration program, ore extraction at the Seabee mine completed during the first quarter and it is currently undergoing decommissioning in advance of closure later this year. Going forward, all ore will be sourced from the Santoy mine.\nThe mill achieved an average throughput of 1,036 tonnes per day during the quarter, 7% higher than the previous quarter due to a combination of Operational Excellence initiatives at both the mill and the Santoy mine. Gold recovery remained consistent at 97.4%.\nPuna Operations, Argentina (1)\nQ1 2018\nQ4 2017\n% Change (3)\nOre milled\nkt\n373\n442\n(15.6%)\nSilver mill feed grade\ng/t\n115\n125\n(8.0%)\nSilver recovery\n%\n67.7%\n66.0%\n2.6%\nSilver produced\nkoz\n938\n1,169\n(19.8%)\nSilver produced (attributable) (2)\nkoz\n704\n877\n(19.7%)\nSilver sold\nkoz\n1,064\n820\n29.8%\nSilver sold (attributable) (2)\nkoz\n798\n615\n29.8%\nNotes :\n(1)\nFigures are on 100% basis unless otherwise noted.\n(2)\nFigures are on a 75% attributable basis.\n(3)\nPercent changes are calculated using rounded numbers presented in the table.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the operation produced 0.9 million ounces of silver, in line with expected silver production from stockpiles of 1.6 million ounces in the first half of 2018. Silver sales were 1.1 million ounces for the quarter as concentrate inventories were reduced. Our attributable share of silver production and sales in the third quarter was 0.7 million ounces and 0.8 million ounces, respectively.\nOre was milled at an average rate of 4,144 tonnes per day in the first quarter, 14% below the previous quarter. Crusher operations in the first quarter were constrained by construction of the crushed ore stockpile dome and wetter than normal weather conditions. Ore milled in the first quarter of 2018 contained an average silver grade of 115 g/t, 8% lower than the 125 g/t reported in the fourth quarter of 2017 as we process increasingly lower grade stockpiles. The average silver recovery in the third quarter was 67.7%, marginally above the previous quarter.\nPartial Disposal of Pretium Common Shares\nDuring the first quarter, we sold 4.0 million common shares of Pretium Resources Inc. (\"Pretium\"), realizing pre-tax net cash proceeds of C$35.1 million. At quarter end, we held 5.0 million common shares, representing approximately 2.8% of Pretium.\nQualified Persons\nThe scientific and technical data contained in this news release relating to the Marigold mine has been reviewed and approved by Thomas Rice, SME Registered Member, a qualified person under National Instrument 43-101 â€“ Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI 43-101\") and our Technical Services Manager at the Marigold mine.
