    "text": "42 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—White House Chief of Staff John Kelly told President Donald Trump last week that he is convinced Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt needs to step down after a series of negative reports about his spending habits and management style, a White House official said Friday.\nThough Mr. Kelly and other White House aides have concluded Mr. Pruitt should leave, the president is not ready to fire him, the official said. Mr. Trump welcomes the deregulatory measures taken by Mr. Pruitt and also values him as a strong advocate for the president’s agenda, this person said.\nThe president, in a tweet Friday, said Mr. Pruitt is doing “a great job,” adding that he is “TOTALLY under siege.”\nThat comment follows remarks aboard Air Force One on Thursday in which he described Pruitt as doing “a fantastic job.” He also said Mr. Pruitt is a “fantastic person,” adding that he still has confidence in the EPA administrator.\nHowever, the president said he would look into the various controversies surrounding Mr. Pruitt. “I have to look at them,” Mr. Trump said, during a flight home from a public appearance in West Virginia. “I’ll make that determination.”\nAn exit by Mr. Pruitt would come in the midst of a high-level staff shake-up by the president. Mr. Trump recently dismissed his secretary of state and national security adviser, and tapped a new appointee for the Central Intelligence Agency. Two of those positions will require Senate approval for their replacements, as would be the case for the EPA administrator.\nThe EPA declined to comment. Over his first year, Mr. Pruitt, a skeptic of climate change, repealed some of former President Barack Obama’s clean-air and other environmental policies. He also urged Mr. Trump to pull out of the Paris climate agreement—advice the president followed.\nThe White House said earlier this week it was conducting a review of Mr. Pruitt’s activities after news reports that he had rented accommodations in Washington at below-market rates from the family of an energy lobbyist .\nMr. Pruitt also has faced questions over his travel expenses , and he had a testy interview with Fox News when he was pressed over large pay raises reportedly given to two EPA employees.\nInside the White House, aides have concluded that Mr. Pruitt’s position is untenable, with a drumbeat of news reports raising questions about his managerial judgment and spending practices.\nThe New York Times reported late Thursday that Mr. Pruitt had reassigned or demoted several officials who raised concerns about spending and management at the EPA.\nAn EPA spokesman responded to the report by calling the officials “disgruntled employees who have either been dismissed or reassigned.”\nMr. Pruitt has defended his living arrangements and said he reversed the pay raises given to two staff members once he found out about them. On the travel costs, the EPA has said Mr. Pruitt’s protective services detail moved him to a higher class due to security protocols.\nWhite House officials were also upset about reports that Mr. Trump phoned Mr. Pruitt on Monday night in an effort to encourage him. Two White House officials said it was the EPA, not the White House, that alerted media to the calls.\n—Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.\nWrite to Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com",
