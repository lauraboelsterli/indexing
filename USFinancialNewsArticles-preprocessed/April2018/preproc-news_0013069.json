    "text": "Good morning. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll reveals a demographic shift that could sway U.S. Congressional elections, Syria and Russia blame Israel for a strike on an air base near Homs and the pope says fighting social injustice is as important as fighting abortion.\nPriests are seen as Pope Francis leads a Holy Mass to mark the feast of Divine Mercy at the Vatican April 8, 2018.

The best of Reuters news delivered right into your inbox absolutely free.\nU.S. politics\nOlder, white, educated voters helped Donald Trump win the White House in 2016. Now, they are trending toward Democrats in such numbers that their ballots could tip the scales in tight congressional races from New Jersey to California, a new Reuters/Ipsos poll and a data analysis of competitive districts shows.\n“The real core for the Republicans is white, older white, and if they’re losing ground there, they’re going to have a tsunami,” said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist who closely tracks political races. “If that continues to November, they’re toast.”\nTrump, who has disparaged Latin American countries over immigration, narcotics and trade, heads to the region this week for a summit that diplomats say is likely to be awkward and tense. “We all know how to smile and nod along , so we’re not too worried,” a Peruvian diplomat said.\nWorld\nThe Russian and Syrian military said Israeli war planes carried out missile strikes on a Syrian air base , hours after Trump warned of a “big price to pay” following reports of a poison gas attack on a rebel-held town.\nNorth Korea has told the United States for the first time that it is prepared to discuss the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula when North Korean leader Kim Jong Un meets President Donald Trump, a U.S. official said yesterday.\nPope Francis said that Catholics should not give “ excessive importance ” to certain Church rules while disregarding others, urging opponents of abortion to show equal passion for the lives of the poor and oppressed. The pope made his appeal in a major document known as an Apostolic Exhortation called “Gaudete et Exsultate” (Rejoice and be Glad), a 100-page booklet on how people can be holy in a modern world filled with secular distractions and materialism.\nCommentary\nNo matter what punitive measures are imposed on Iran, Tehran sees its missile program as essential for its self-preservation and is unlikely to agree to any restrictions beyond a superficial “cap” on the range of its missiles, writes Maysam Behravesh .\n“Decades of deep-rooted mistrust and institutionalized hostility between the Islamic Republic and Western powers have convinced Iranian leaders that the more they retreat and compromise, the more their rivals will advance and demand.” Business\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will hold meetings with some U.S. lawmakers today , a day before he is due to appear at Congressional hearings over a political consultancy’s use of customer data, two congressional aides said.\nChristian Sewing must quickly come up with a coherent strategy for Deutsche Bank after the retail banking veteran was promoted to chief executive of Germany’s largest lender.\nWith General Motors cutting some 2,600 jobs and threatening to leave South Korea in the absence of steep union concessions, the once sympathetic public is nowhere to be seen .\nDavid Solomon, soon to be the sole No. 2 to Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, still finds time to pursue a beloved hobby: spinning records at big-city nightclubs under the handle DJ D-Sol .\nReuters TV\nPrime Minister Viktor Orban wins a third straight term in power in Sunday elections after his anti-immigration campaign message helps him cinch a strong majority for his party in parliament.\n ",
