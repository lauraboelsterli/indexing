    "text": "TORONTO, April 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GrowMax Resources Corp. (the “ Company ” or “ GrowMax Resources ”) (TSX-V:GRO) announces today that it has filed its 2017 audited consolidated financial statements, including the Auditor’s Report thereon, and Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) relating to its 2017 year-end results. These filings can be accessed on SEDAR’s website at www.sedar.com and on the Company’s website at www.growmaxcorp.com .\nThe following Summary of Selected Financial and Operational Highlights have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements and MD&A. Readers are strongly encouraged to review the entire audited consolidated financial statements, including the Auditor’s Report thereon, and MD&A.\nAll amounts are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated.\nSUMMARY OF SELECTED FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS\n($ in thousands) December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Cash and cash equivalents 39,157 42,896 Working capital (1) 39,560 49,634\nYear ended December 31 ($ in thousands) 2017 2016 General and administrative expenses\n(excluding stock-based compensation and depreciation) 3,522 4,276 Foreign exchange loss (gain) 2,994 (75 ) Net cash used by operating activities 4,507 12,613 Capital expenditures, net 5,273 10,777 Note:\n(1) Working capital is calculated as current assets (December 31, 2017 - $43.3 million; December 31, 2016 - $52.4 million) less current liabilities (December 31, 2017 - $3.7 million; December 31, 2016 - $2.8 million). Working capital is a non-GAAP measure and is calculated as current assets less current liabilities. Working capital is used to assess liquidity and general financial strength. Working capital does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS. It is unlikely for non-GAAP measures to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. Working capital should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than current assets or current liabilities as determined in accordance with IFRS.\nJAMIE SOMERVILLE DEPARTS GROWMAX RESOURCES\nMr. Jamie Somerville, who has been the Company’s Executive Vice President, will be leaving GrowMax effective May 1, 2018. In order to assist in the transition of his responsibilities, the Company has hired a project management consultant to take over Mr. Somerville’s responsibilities related to the brine project.\n“On behalf of our Board of Directors and everyone at GrowMax Resources, I want to thank Jamie for his dedication and numerous contributions during his time with the Company. We wish him success in his future endeavors,” stated Stephen Keith, President and CEO of GrowMax Resources.\nFor more information, please contact:\nStephen Keith, P.
