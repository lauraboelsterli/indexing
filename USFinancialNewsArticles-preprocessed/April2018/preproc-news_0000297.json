    "text": "First Quarter 2018 Redneck Riviera Launch Exceeds Expectations, Wine Canning Sales Commence, and the Sandstrom-Rebranded Burnside Line Gets Traction and Resumes Its Growth\nPORTLAND, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Eastside Distilling, Inc. (NASDAQ: EAST), a producer of craft spirits, reported fourth quarter and year-end 2017 financial results. Management also addressed trends in Eastside’s business as of the end of Q1 2018.\n2017 Financial Results:\nGross sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 were of $3,791,382, an increase of 25% compared to $3,042,527 in 2016, led by record sales of our Portland Potato Vodka, which increased around 250% during the year. Total shipments increased to 23,471 cases during 2017 (19,567 for branded products and 3,904 for private label) from 15,596 cases in 2016, an increase of 50.5% Adjusted EBITDA improved to $(3,370,320) compared to $(3,656,196) in 2016. Our net loss of $5.3 million in 2017 was similar to the $5.3 million in 2016.\nThe Company believes its new business strategies started in 2017 have laid the foundation for accelerated growth in 2018. During 2017, the Burnside product line, which accounted for 40% of 2016 revenue, was discontinued and rebranded into the new Burnside product line, and was introduced in the last quarter of 2017. Despite this interruption and transition of a major part of our product offering, and unexpected shortfalls related to the Motherlode acquisition, our business maintained growth during 2017.\nKey Operational Highlights from 2017:\nWorking closely with Sandstrom Partners, a spirits branding powerhouse, we completed the rebranding of our flagship product, Burnside, in Q4 2017; We negotiated an agreement with country music star John Rich for a new whiskey product under the brand “Redneck Riviera,” which we began shipping in Q1 2018; We consolidated our production facilities and made significant investments to expand production, including adding the new “slim line” canning capability; We completed a public offering of $6.2 million in gross proceeds and “up-listed” to NASDAQ; The December 2017 tax legislation, which went into effect Jan 1 of this year, is expected to add more than ten points to gross profit margins during in 2018; The new product pipeline with Sandstrom remains strong, with several new product launches expected in 2018; and We added industry veteran Tom Wood as VP of Production to further professionalize our Motherlode canning operations and assist with spirit production.\n2018 Outlook:\nWe exited Q1 2018 with strong and building momentum in all of our major strategic initiatives—the Redneck Riviera brand, the new Sandstrom branding and wine canning. We expect Q1 2018 to be a record sales quarter for the Company, driven by:\nEastside shipped over 2,800 9L cases of Redneck Riviera Whiskey during Q1 2018; Rebranded Burnside product lineup continues to gain momentum in our home state of Oregon, as well as other key markets; and Our wine canning business launched in March 2018 with production for our first two Pacific Northwest wineries.\nRedneck Riviera Whiskey Launch Highlights Since January 2018:\nSigned distribution agreement with the country’s two largest spirit distributors, including Republic National Distributing Company (“RNDC”), to distribute Redneck Riviera Whiskey throughout the Gulf Coast, upper Midwest and California. Redneck Riviera Whiskey is currently distributed in 14 states, including Texas, California, Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Florida, North Carolina, North and South Dakota, Oregon, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Nebraska. Strong promotional support has been provided for Redneck Riviera Whiskey since its launch, with John Rich making appearances on national TV shows, including Today Show with Megyn Kelly ; local TV shows, including NBC , ABC and Fox affiliates; in-store appearances to support retailers; performances at numerous events, including the ROTH Capital Partners 2018 Conference ; participation in the Nasdaq Closing Bell ceremony ; as well as distributor and customer events . Significant retailer adoption, including authorization by Walmart in Florida, Louisiana and California; the largest liquor retailer in Texas, Spec’s ; as well as one of the largest independent supermarkets in the Gulf Coast, Rouses .\nManagement Commentary\nGrover Wickersham, CEO of Eastside Distilling, commented, “Our hard work in 2017 set the stage for accelerated growth in 2018 – our Sandstrom rebranded products, our deal with John Rich, our increased spirit production and canning capability, our uplisting to the Nasdaq, and hiring of key new people in sales, marketing and operations. These investments are all paying off in 2018.”\n“We are extremely excited by how well our Redneck Riviera Whiskey launch is going. Our partnering with John Rich to offer a high-quality American blended whiskey to compete against imported whiskey at an attractive price point, looks to be a home run. We are gearing up to meet customer demand by ramping up our production capabilities. 2018 is off to a great start, and we believe it will only get better each quarter.”\n“We discontinued our flagship Burnside product line through much of 2017 and sold through in-store inventory. Obviously, this killed growth of Burnside in Oregon and we also stopped our out of state effort. Now our rebranded Burnside Bourbon lineup is once again seeing its growth accelerate.”\nMr. Wickersham concluded, “Our strategy of creating a ‘brand factory’ at Eastside Distilling is going according to plan. In addition to our Redneck Riviera Whiskey and Burnside products, the rebranding of our coffee rum product to Hue-Hue Cold Brew Coffee Rum in early 2018 was also met with tremendous reviews. The branding by Sandstrom Partners highlights Hue-Hue’s full flavor cold brew coffee, without the syrupy sweetness of coffee liqueurs. Hue-Hue sales should grow in 2018 and other new products will follow. Sandstrom has many more innovations in the works. By leveraging our successes to date, we hope to create greater shareholder value in 2018.”\nFinancial Results\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Eastside Distilling reported record gross sales of $3,791,382, an increase of 25% compared to $3,042,527 in 2016. As previously discussed, sales growth was driven by increased wholesale sales traction within the Pacific Northwest, especially with our Vodka product, as we strategically invested in programs to promote the Vodka product while waiting for our new Burnside Bourbon branding launch. With the launch of Redneck Riviera Whiskey, introduction of our wine canning operations and re-introduction of our Burnside product lineup in earnest occurring subsequent to the end of the year, we anticipate growth increasing significantly during 2018.\nGross profit margins (as a percent of Net Sales) were 37% during 2017 compared to 39% during 2016. As previously discussed, gross profit margins in 2018 will benefit by the Craft Modernization and Tax Reform Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) enacted by Congress as part of the 2017 tax legislation package. The Tax Act reduced the Federal Excise Tax (“FET”) from $13.50 to $2.70 per gallon for the first 100,000 proof gallons per year, an 80% tax reduction. In the event that Eastside’s production reaches the 100,000 proof gallons per annum needed to fully utilize the tax benefits of the Tax Act, annual savings will exceed $1 million. The Tax Act expires in two years unless renewed. In addition to benefits to gross profit margins by the Tax Act, Eastside is focused on other operational and purchasing initiatives to improve margins.\nAdvertising, promotional and selling expenses increased to $2,219,168 in 2017 from $1,244,152 in 2016, however, general and administrative expense decreased to $3,546,659 during 2017 compared to $3,881,771 in 2016, as the Company focused on driving sales growth, while tightening cost controls.\nAdjusted EBITDA during 2017 was $(3,370,320), which compared to $(3,656,196) in 2016.\nNet loss attributable to common shareholders was $(5,277,316), or $(1.42) per basic and diluted share for 2017, compared $(5,251,293), or $(1.40) per basic and diluted share in the year ago period.\nThe company ended the year with $2.6 million in cash and inventories of $4.1 million. The inventory balance was an increase of $3.3 million compared to the year ago period as the company purchased bulk spirits to meet the anticipated demand of its newly launched Redneck Riviera Whiskey.\nRecent Securities Issuances and Additions to Liquidity\nSubsequent to the end of the 2017 fiscal year, the Company issued $2.2 million of principal amount of 5% Notes maturing May 1, 2021, accompanied by approximately 135,000 callable Common Stock Purchase Warrants with an exercise price of $5.40 per share. Additionally, we received approximately $680,400 from the early exercise of our publicly traded $5.40 warrants that were part of the August 2017 “uplisting” public offering.\nConference Call\nThe Company will hold a conference call today to discuss these results.\nDate and Time : 4:30 p.m. ET on Monday, April 2, 2018\nCall-in Information : Interested parties can access the conference call by dialing (844) 889-4332 or (412) 717-9595.\nLive Webcast Information : Interested parties can access the conference call via a live Internet webcast, which is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at https://www.eastsidedistilling.com/investors/ .\nTo Ask a Question : The conference call will be moderated by Lytham Partners, an investor relations firm.
