    "text": "LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - The European Union should not stop its accession talks with Turkey despite a lack of progress and questions about the rule of law in the country, Germany’s EU minister said on Tuesday.\nGerman Minister of State for Europe Michael Roth attends a European Union foreign ministers meeting in Brussels, Belgium May 15, 2017. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir The European Commission is expected to hand out its most critical report on talks with Turkey since the country launched its bid to join the European Union over a decade ago.\n“It is in the hands of those responsible in Turkey to decide whether they want to be a member of this European community of values,” Michael Roth said on arrival to a meeting of EU ministers in Luxembourg.\n“I would suggest we do not slam the door shut. That would be a wrong signal toward those in Turkey who still long for European values,” he added.\nBut Austria’s minister Gernot Bluemel said the talks should be halted. “We don’t believe Turkey should become a part of the European Union,” Bluemel said.\nReporting by Gabriela Baczynska, Robert-Jan Bartunek\n ",
