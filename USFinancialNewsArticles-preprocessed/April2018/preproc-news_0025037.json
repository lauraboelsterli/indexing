    "text": "Published: Apr 12, 2018 5:17 p.m. ET Share \nThe alternatives to Hong Kong’s current currency peg are worse AFP/Getty Images \nBy Jacky Wong \nHong Kong’s currency peg with the U.S. dollar has many problems. It is still the city’s least worst option. \nThe Hong Kong dollar USDHKD, +0.0089% on Thursday briefly touched the bottom of its permitted trading band against the U.S. dollar for the first time since the peg took its current form in 2005. That stoked concerns that the city’s de facto central bank would step in to drain some of the money sloshing around in the banking system—money that has fueled gains in the city’s stock and property markets. \nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority stands ready to step in when the Hong Kong dollar falls to 7.85 to the U.S. dollar—as it did Thursday—or rises to 7.75. \nIt isn’t the first time Hong Kong’s 35-year-old dollar peg has come under strain.",
