FILE PHOTO: A Flybe aircraft takes off from George Best Belfast City airport in Belfast, Northern Ireland, June 27, 2017. Picture taken June 27, 2017. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne/File Photo \nA Siberian weather system that British forecasters dubbed the “beast from the east” brought snow, strong winds and the coldest temperatures in several years to many regions in the two months through March. \nFlybe said it was particularly affected by the cold spell as all of its operations are based within the UK and near continent. \nThe airline cancelled 994 flights due to bad weather in its fourth quarter, compared with 372 flight cancellations in the same period a year earlier. \nFlybe said it would book about 4 million pounds in lost revenue and additional care and assistance costs in annual results on cancelled and delayed flights. \nThe company, however, said load factor in the fourth quarter ended March 31 was up 6.8 percentage points to 73.5 percent, as it reduced capacity. \nThe carrier estimated a 7.5 percent increase in passenger revenue per seat in the summer, offsetting an expected 7.9 percent decrease in capacity.
