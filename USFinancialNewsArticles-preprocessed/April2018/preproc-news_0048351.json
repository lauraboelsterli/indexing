    "text": "HOUSTON, April 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Flotek Industries, Inc. (\"Flotek\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: FTK) provided an update on the Company's revenue and EBITDA expectations regarding its results for the three months-ended March 31, 2018.\nFlotek expects its consolidated revenues for the first quarter of 2018 to be in the $59 million - $62 million range. Energy Chemistry Technologies (\"ECT\") segment revenues are expected to be in the $40 million - $42 million range and Consumer and Industrial Chemistry Technologies (\"CICT\") segment revenues are expected to be in the $19 million - $20 million range. Flotek expects to report negative EBITDA (non-GAAP) for the first quarter.\nJohn Chisholm, Flotek's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer commented, \"At the start of the quarter, our revenues were impacted by weather-related delays in activity. While we continued to focus on fixed cost reductions, our efforts did not keep pace with revenue declines. Looking ahead, we will focus on accelerating product introductions to increase market share and remain diligent on cost control efforts.\"\nFlotek plans to release its financial and operating results in a press release after the market close on May 9, 2018. The press release will contain dial-in information for Flotek's results conference call, which is scheduled for Thursday, May 10, 2018 at 9:30 a.m. CT (10:30 a.m. ET).\nAll estimated financial information contained herein are preliminary estimates determined in good faith based on Flotek's internal reporting for the first quarter of 2018 and remain subject to the completion of the Company's customary quarterly close and review procedures related to its quarterly financial statement closing process and review by the Company's independent public accounting firm. Material adjustments may arise between the date of this press release and the date on which the Company announces its full first quarter 2018 results and files its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 with the SEC.\nEBITDA is a Non-GAAP financial measure, is not prepared in accordance with, or as an alternative for, GAAP financial measures, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Explanations of why the Company finds EBITDA useful and a reconciliation of EBITDA to a comparable GAAP financial measure will be included in the earnings press release along with the disclosure of EBITDA.\nAbout Flotek Industries, Inc.\nFlotek develops and delivers prescriptive chemistry-based technology, including specialty chemicals, to clients in the energy, consumer industrials and food & beverage industries.
