    "text": "THE WOODLANDS, Texas, April 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CB&I (NYSE:CBI) today announced preliminary financial results for the first quarter of 2018. The company expects to report:\nRevenue of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion Income from operations of $100 million to $110 million EBITDA 1 of $118 million to $128 million Net income of $37 million to $43 million Fully diluted earnings per share of $0.37 to $0.43 New awards of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion Backlog 2 of $10.5 billion to $10.6 billion Net cash used in operating activities of $220 million to $240 million Total debt of $2.5 billion to $2.55 billion\nCB&I's preliminary results reflect:\nExcellent operating performance across the company's portfolio of projects, including the Cameron and Freeport LNG projects and the Calpine combined-cycle natural gas power project, which respectively reached 84%, 82% and 84% completion and incurred no material project charges during the quarter; Restructuring charges of between $4 million and $6 million, or $0.03 to $0.05 per diluted share, related primarily to professional fees incurred in connection with the company's strategic activities; and Excess interest expense of between $20 million and $22 million, or $0.16 to $0.17 per diluted share, associated with higher interest rates versus the year-ago quarter due to previous debt covenant amendments.\nThe company continues to have a robust prospect list for potential new awards in 2018. In particular, CB&I is experiencing a high level of bid activity and expects customer investment decisions to be made this year on a number of very large projects in LNG, petrochemical and other markets.\n1\nEBITDA is defined as income from operations plus depreciation and amortization, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. See reconciliation of Non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures below.\n2\nBacklog includes values associated with our unconsolidated equity method joint ventures. See reconciliation of Non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures below.\nAs previously announced, the company will report its financial results for the first quarter of 2018 on April 23, 2018 after the close of the U.S. market. Due to the company's pending combination with McDermott International, Inc., CB&I will not conduct an earnings conference call to discuss these results. CB&I and McDermott remain fully committed to completing their proposed combination during the second quarter of 2018.\nChicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to GAAP Financial Measures\nCB&I reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). This communication also includes Non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the SEC's Regulation G. We included EBITDA as it is widely used by investors for valuation and comparing financial performance with the performance of other companies. Our backlog includes amounts associated with our equity method joint ventures to provide an indication of the total unearned value of our new awards. The following table reconciles Non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP financial measures:\n(In millions)\nEstimate for\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\n(Unaudited)\nIncome from Operations\n$100 - $110\nDepreciation & Amortization\n~19\nNoncontrolling Interest\n~(1)\nEBITDA\n$118 - $128\n(In billions)\nEstimate as of\nMarch 31, 2018\n(Unaudited)\nGAAP Backlog\n$9.4 - $9.5\nBacklog of unconsolidated equity method joint ventures\n~1.1\nNon-GAAP Backlog\n$10.5 - $10.6\nAbout CB&I\nCB&I (NYSE:CBI) is a leading provider of technology and infrastructure for the energy industry.
