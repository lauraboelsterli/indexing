The Company reported net income of $12.3 million, or $0.25 per diluted common share for the fourth quarter of 2017 and net income of $15.2 million, or $0.39 per diluted common share for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income 1 for the first quarter of 2018 was $24.9 million, or $0.51 per diluted common share compared to $22.5 million, or $0.46 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $15.8 million, or $0.41 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nIn addition to the Company’s organic growth, first quarter of 2018 results compared to the first quarter of 2017 benefitted from the acquisition of First Community Financial Partners, Inc. (“First Community”), since the closing of the transaction on July 2, 2017 and Mid Illinois Bancorp, Inc. (“Mid Illinois”), the holding company of South Side Trust & Savings Bank (“South Side”) of Peoria, since the closing of the transaction on October 1, 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity was 1.16% and 14.18%, respectively, on a basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Based on adjusted net income 1 , return on average assets was 1.32% and return on average tangible common equity was 16.13% for the same period.\nThe Company views certain non-operating items including, but not limited to, acquisition and restructuring charges, as adjustments to net income. Non-operating adjustments for the first quarter of 2018 include $1.7 million in compensation and severance and $2.3 million in legal, data processing conversion, and other expenses related to acquisitions. The reconciliation of Non-GAAP measures (including adjusted net income, adjusted efficiency ratio, adjusted return on average assets (“ROA”), return on average tangible common equity, tangible book value and tangible book value per share), which the Company believes facilitates the assessment of its banking operations and peer comparability, is included in tabular form at the end of this release.\n1 Adjusted net income, a Non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Information” below for reconciliation\nOverview and Strategy:\nWe continue to focus on our Company’s organic growth and to evaluate and execute on acquisitions which fit our strategy. We are pleased to have completed the merger of South Side at the close of business on March 16, 2018. The addition of South Side has enhanced the Company’s deposit, commercial banking and trust and investment presence in the greater Peoria area.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we continued to emphasize our key priorities - balance sheet strength, profitability and growth -achieved within a framework of safety and soundness. Our capital position remains strong and we continue to focus on a sound credit foundation. We believe our emphasis on commercial banking and wealth management, supplemented by our remittance processing activities will drive growth in 2018 and beyond.\nBusey recently received its third consecutive honor as one of the best places to work voted on by associates. The 2018 Best Places to Work in Illinois award program, by Best Companies Group and Daily Herald Business Ledger, identifies, recognizes and honors the best places of employment in Illinois – benefiting the state’s economy, workforce and businesses.\nBusey takes pride in its culture and its commitment to the communities we serve. We are grateful to you for allowing us the opportunity to serve you and your community.\n/s/ Van A.

First quarter 2018 commercial loan production of $30.4 million was driven by organic originations, particularly in the Missouri market, and was offset by a decline in retail loan balances of $18.4 million. The balance of loans held for sale at March 31, 2018 was $29.0 million compared to $94.8 million at December 31, 2017. Average portfolio loans increased to $5.508 billion for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $3.862 billion for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 42.6%.\nAverage interest-earning assets for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased to $6.976 billion compared to $6.933 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 42.3% compared to $4.904 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nTotal deposits were $6.331 billion at March 31, 2018 an increase of 3.3% from $6.126 billion at December 31, 2017 and 41.1% from $4.486 billion at March 31, 2017. The Company remains funded primarily through core deposits with solid liquidity and significant market share in core Illinois markets.\nNet Interest Margin and Net Interest Income: Net interest income of $59.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 decreased by 5.2% from $63.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased by 42.2% from $42.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net purchase accounting accretion and amortization included in interest income and interest expense was $3.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease from $5.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase from $1.9 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe net interest margin decreased to 3.52% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 3.68% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 3.53% for the first quarter of 2017. Net of purchase accounting accretion and amortization, the net interest margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 3.32%, a decrease from 3.34% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 3.38% for the first quarter of 2017. Changes in net interest margin were driven by the pricing on deposits obtained through the South Side acquisition.\nAsset Quality: As of March 31, 2018, non-performing loans increased to $33.6 million, compared to $27.4 million as of December 31, 2017, and $20.9 million as of March 31, 2017. The increase in non-performing loans is driven by two large commercial relationships which the Company is actively working to resolve. Non-performing loans were 0.61% of total portfolio loans as of March 31, 2018, compared to 0.50% as of December 31, 2017 and 0.54% as of March 31, 2017.\nThe Company recorded net charge-offs of $1.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase compared to $0.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, and net recoveries of $0.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of portfolio loans was 0.95% at March 31, 2018 as compared to 0.97% at December 31, 2017 and 1.25% at March 31, 2017. As a result of acquisitions, the Company is holding acquired loans that are carried net of a fair value adjustment for credit and interest rate marks and are only included in the allowance calculation to the extent that the reserve requirement exceeds the fair value adjustment. The Company recorded provision for loan losses of $1.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nWith a continued commitment to asset quality and the strength of our balance sheet, near-term loan losses are expected to remain generally low. While these results are encouraging, asset quality metrics can be generally influenced by market specific economic conditions and specific measures may fluctuate from period to period.\nAsset Quality 1 As of and for the Three Months Ended (dollars in thousands) March 31, December 31, September 30, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 2017 Portfolio loans $ 5,531,453 $ 5,519,500 $ 5,085,864 $ 3,872,952 Non-performing loans Non-accrual loans 32,588 24,624 27,430 20,544 Loans 90+ days past due 995 2,741 439 311 Non-performing loans, segregated by geography Illinois/ Indiana 28,743 23,093 23,680 16,778 Missouri 3,641 2,964 2,682 3,154 Florida 1,199 1,308 1,507 923 Loans 30-89 days past due 9,506 12,897 11,556 9,804 Other non-performing assets 1,001 1,283 1,172 739 Non-performing assets to portfolio loans and non-performing assets 0.63 % 0.52 % 0.57 % 0.56 % Allowance as a percentage of non-performing loans 156.77 % 195.80 % 183.13 % 232.28 % Allowance for loan losses to portfolio loans 0.95 % 0.97 % 1.00 % 1.25 % Net charge-offs (recoveries) $ 1,941 $ 262 $ (340 ) $ (147 ) Provision for loan losses 1,008 2,809 1,494 500 1 Results are unaudited except for amounts reported as of December 31, 2017 Fee-based Businesses: Revenues from trust fees, commissions and brokers’ fees, and remittance processing activities represented 53.4% of the Company’s non-interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, providing a balance to revenue from traditional banking activities. Two of the Company’s acquisitions, Pulaski Financial Corp. and First Community had no legacy fee income in these businesses; therefore, the addition of these fee-based service offerings in these acquired bank markets is expected to continue providing attractive growth opportunities in future periods.\nTrust fees and commissions and brokers’ fees of $8.6 million for the first quarter of 2018 increased from $7.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $6.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net income from the wealth management segment increased to $2.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $1.5 million or a notable 88.2% increase from the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1.8 million or 49.6% increase from the first quarter of 2017. Market expansion resulting from the South Side acquisition and strong performance from Busey Ag Services, a wealth management division of Busey Bank, contributed to the positive results. Busey Wealth Management ended the first quarter of 2018 with $6.910 billion in assets under care, a 15.9% increase from the fourth quarter of 2017 creating positive momentum going forward.\nRemittance processing revenue of $3.4 million for the first quarter of 2018 increased from $2.8 million for the first and fourth quarters of 2017. Net income from the remittance processing segment was $1.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase from $0.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $0.6 million for the first quarter of 2017. The positive 2018 results are a reflection of new customer activity and volume increases from existing customers.\nMortgage revenue decreased to $1.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $2.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $2.1 million for the first quarter of 2017, reflecting the realignment of mortgage origination resources to the Company’s current market through the sale of certain mortgage locations in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOperating Efficiency: An active business outreach across the Company’s footprint continues to support ongoing business expansion and effectively underlies the combination of the operations acquired from recent acquisitions with that of the Company. The Company expects to see greater operating efficiencies from the South Side integration beginning in the second quarter of 2018. The efficiency ratio, inclusive of acquisition and restructuring costs, of 59.7% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased slightly from 58.8% for the same period of 2017. The adjusted efficiency ratio 2 was 55.4% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and 57.3% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The Company remains consistently focused on expense discipline.\nSpecific areas of operating performance are detailed as follows:\nSalaries, wages and employee benefits increased to $28.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $28.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $21.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. The recent acquisitions added to the Company’s headcount and the Company recorded total restructuring costs of $1.7 million in 2018.\nData processing expense in the first quarter of 2018 decreased to $5.2 million, compared to $6.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, but increased compared to $3.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Variances are largely related to payment of deconversion expenses related to acquisitions.\nOther operating expenses decreased to $9.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $11.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, but increased compared to $6.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 across multiple categories.\nCapital Strength: The Company's strong capital levels, coupled with its earnings, have allowed it to provide a steady return to its stockholders through dividends. The Company will pay a cash dividend on April 27, 2018 of $0.20 per common share to stockholders of record as of April 20, 2018. The Company has consistently paid dividends to its common stockholders since the bank holding company was organized in 1980.\nAs of March 31, 2018, First Busey continued to exceed the capital adequacy requirements necessary to be considered “well-capitalized” under applicable regulatory guidelines. The Company’s tangible stockholders’ common equity 3 (“TCE”) increased to $646.9 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $638.0 million at December 31, 2017 and $489.2 million at March 31, 2017. TCE represented 8.64% of tangible assets at March 31, 2018, compared to 8.43% at December 31, 2017 and 9.19% at March 31, 2017. 4\n2 Adjusted efficiency ratio, a Non-GAAP financial measure, see “Non-GAAP Financial Information” below for reconciliation\n3 Tangible stockholders’ common equity, see “Non-GAAP Financial Information” below for reconciliation\n4 Tangible assets, see “Non-GAAP Financial Information” below for reconciliation\nCorporate Profile\nAs of March 31, 2018, First Busey Corporation (Nasdaq:BUSE) was a $7.8 billion financial holding company headquartered in Champaign, Illinois.

Elliott, Chief Operating Officer & Chief Financial Officer, 217-365-4120\nJennifer L. Simons, Chief Accounting Officer, 217-365-4309\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThis press release contains certain financial information determined by methods other than GAAP. These measures include adjusted net income, adjusted ROA, adjusted net interest margin, adjusted efficiency ratio, tangible common equity, tangible common equity to tangible assets and return on average common equity. Management uses these Non-GAAP measures, together with the related GAAP measures, in analysis of the Company’s performance and in making business decisions. Management also uses these measures for peer comparisons.\nA reconciliation to what management believes to be the most direct compared GAAP financial measures – net income in the case of adjusted net income and adjusted ROA, total net interest income, total non-interest income and total non-interest expense in the case of adjusted efficiency ratio, total stockholders’ equity in the case of the tangible book value per share – appears below. The Company believes each of the adjusted measures are useful for investors and management to understand the effects of certain non-interest items and provides additional perspective on the Company’s performance over time as well as comparison to the Company’s peers.\nThese Non-GAAP disclosures have inherent limitations and are not audited. They should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the results reported in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to Non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.
