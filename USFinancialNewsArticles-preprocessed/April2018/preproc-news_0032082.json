    "text": "BRASILIA, April 16 (Reuters) - Economic activity in Brazil barely expanded in February after contracting the month before, central bank data showed on Monday, suggesting the recovery hit a bump in the first months of the year.\nThe central bank’s economic activity index rose 0.09 percent from the month before, less than the 0.15 percent median estimate in a Reuters survey of economists.\nThe bank also revised the January reading to show a larger contraction of 0.65 percent, compared to the previously published 0.56 percent decline, adding to a string of weak readings on retail sales and services activity suggesting sluggish first-quarter economic growth.\nThis highlights an uneven pickup from the deepest recession in decades, which slashed Brazil’s gross domestic product by 8 percent between the fourth quarter of 2014 and end-2016.\nIt also suggests the central bank will find no resistance to cutting interest rates once again to a new record low next month, with inflation stagnated below the bottom end of its target range amid double-digit unemployment rates.\nIn a report, JPMorgan economists said the latest batch of disappointing activity figures may prompt them to revise down their forecast for a 3.2 percent pace of economic growth in the first quarter.\nYields paid on interest rate future contracts were slightly lower in early trading as investors increased their bets on a 25 basis-point rate cut at the central bank’s May meeting.\nCentral bank chief Ilan Goldfajn has repeatedly stated plans to cut the benchmark Selic rate next month and then stand pat.
