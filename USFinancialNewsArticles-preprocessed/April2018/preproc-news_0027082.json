He says, \"We want one message to be clear: We are with the people of Venezuela.\"\nThe funds are through the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development.\nPence is in Lima for an international summit. He was meeting with Venezuelan opposition leaders. They include National Assembly President Julio Borges and former Caracas mayor Antonio Ledezma.\n3:05 p.m.\nVice President Mike Pence has arrived in Peru for a Latin American summit at which he's expected to push a tough line on Venezuela and point to the U.S. as an ideal trading partner in the region.\nPence is filling in for   at the Summit of the Americas in Lima after the president pulled out to focus on the U.S. response to an apparent chemical weapons attack in Syria.\nThe vice president is expected to urge Latin American leaders to maintain pressure on the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
