    "text": "April 4, 2018 / 9:42 AM / Updated 4 hours ago In boost for Britain, Peugeot to build new van at Vauxhall plant Costas Pitas 3 Min Read \nLUTON, England (Reuters) - Peugeot-maker PSA ( PEUP.PA ) has unveiled plans to raise output at its British Vauxhall van plant, in a pre-Brexit show of confidence that will raise pressure on sister brand Opel’s German workforce to offer concessions in labor talks. \nPSA, which last year acquired Opel/Vauxhall from General Motors ( GM.N ), will build Peugeot and Citroen models as well as the next Vauxhall Vivaro van in Luton, north of London. Production will rise to 100,000 vehicles from 60,000 in 2017. \nThe French group, which is locked in labor talks with Opel’s German workers, said the Luton investment was helped by “responsible social dialogue with the Unite union guaranteeing production flexibility”, as well as UK government support. \nThe union said 350-400 jobs would be created as a result of the investment, which PSA said would amount to about 100 million euros ($123 million). Around 1,400 people are currently employed at the site, which is Britain’s only van plant. \nThe announcement is a boost to Prime Minister Theresa May ahead of talks to decide Britain’s long-term trading relationship with the European Union, although PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares underscored the need for free trade. Related Coverage \n“I take on board the assurances that the UK government have provided us on seeking tariff-free and frictionless trade with the EU going forward,” he said at the plant on Wednesday. \n“There is still work to do to ensure frictionless trade.” \nThe Vivaro, which currently shares underpinnings with Renault’s ( RENA.PA ) Trafic van, will in future be assembled on PSA’s EMP2 vehicle platform.
