    "text": "INDIANAPOLIS, Calumet Specialty Products Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ: CLMT) (the \"Partnership,\" \"Calumet,\" \"we,\" \"our\" or \"us\"), a leading independent producer of petroleum-based specialty products, today reported revised results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, as follows:\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(Dollars in millions, except per unit data)\nNet loss\n$\n(83.6)\n$\n(79.6)\n$\n(103.8)\n$\n(328.6)\nLimited partners' interest basic and diluted net loss per unit\n$\n(1.06)\n$\n(1.01)\n$\n(1.31)\n$\n(4.18)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n41.2\n$\n27.7\n$\n317.2\n$\n158.2\nThe Partnership's $83.6 million Net loss for the fourth quarter 2017 included the impact of: (1) a $173.4 million net gain on sale from the divestitures of both the Superior, Wisconsin refinery (\"Superior Refinery\") and Anchor Drilling Fluids USA, LLC; (2) $206.9 million non-cash impairment charges primarily related to the revaluation of the Partnership's property, plant and equipment at several facilities; and (3) a $6.1 million adjustment related to allowances for bad debt reserves. Without these adjustments, Net loss for the fourth quarter 2017 would have been $44.0 million or $(0.56) per unit.\nThe Partnership's $41.2 million Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2017 included: (1) a $9.6 million favorable net impact related to lower of cost or market (\"LCM\") inventory adjustments and last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") inventory layers; (2) a $12.9 million net expense related to enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\") system expenses and realized hedging losses; and (3) a $6.1 million adjustment related to allowances for bad debt reserves. Without these impacts, Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2017 would have been $50.6 million.\nInvestors are advised to review the annual results on Form 10-K filed today for further details of the results, as well as the investor relations section of our website where we have provided an updated investor presentation for the quarter. For detailed information on Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the nearest comparable GAAP measure for the periods presented above, please see the sections of this release entitled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" and \"Reconciliation of Net Loss To EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow.\"\nManagement Commentary\n\"I am pleased to report that we have successfully turned the corner. We have delivered five consecutive quarters of improved earnings results on a year-over-year basis. We called our high-interest senior secured notes last month. We recently extended our corporate revolver to a new five-year term, which is a great sign that our lenders have recognized the positive steps we have taken to improve the Partnership's operational and financial performance,\" said Tim Go, Chief Executive Officer of Calumet. \"While we are disappointed the implementation of our enterprise planning system has been more challenging than envisioned and has caused delays in the filings of our third and fourth quarters results, our momentum and forward outlook remains intact. At this time last year, I stated that 2017 was going to be our year to execute on our strategic efforts. Our management team and all of our employees have delivered on that promise. Our self-help program continued to structurally improve our base business and exceed the run-rate of our initial projections, and we made significant strides towards our long-term strategic goals. Our liquidity continued to strengthen, and our leverage has declined significantly from roughly 13 times Adjusted EBITDA last year to under five times today. We also continued to expand our high-value specialty products business through new product innovation, production capacity expansions, and by growing our branded products business.\"\nGo continued, \"On the strategic front, 2017 was a very important year for Calumet, as we completed the divestitures of two significant non-core assets during the period: our Superior Refinery and our oilfield services business. These transactions will reduce volatility in our business and allow Calumet to focus on our core specialties business. Further, the proceeds from these transactions will allow us to retire our high-yield senior secured notes, with an expected closing date of April 9th.\"\nGo concluded, \"As we look forward, we need to carry the momentum we have generated into 2018 and beyond. We remain committed to driving further self-help across our portfolio and have set a 2018 target to realize an additional $40 to $50 million in Adjusted EBITDA. This will be driven by new product growth, margin enhancements and cost savings, some of which we have identified through our newly implemented ERP system. All of these initiatives will be key to our efforts to further reduce balance sheet leverage and enhance our profitability as we work to transform the business and execute our vision to become the premier specialty petroleum products company in the world.\"\nSpecialty Products Segment | Results Summary\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(Dollars in millions, except per barrel data)\nSpecialty products segment gross profit\n$\n64.2\n$\n59.3\n$\n319.2\n$\n338.1\nSpecialty products segment Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n30.8\n$\n28.0\n$\n186.5\n$\n188.9\nSpecialty products segment gross profit per barrel\n$\n30.07\n$\n25.30\n$\n33.93\n$\n34.57\nSpecialty products segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin\n9.8\n%\n9.2\n%\n14.3\n%\n15.1\n%\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, total specialty products segment gross profit increased 8.3% compared to the year-ago period, driven by healthier market conditions, offset somewhat by rising crude feedstock costs. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2017 was $30.8 million, which was a 10.0% improvement compared to the year-ago period, despite the lower sales volumes associated with the lubes turnaround at Shreveport. Specialty products segment gross profit per barrel in the period was $30.07, which grew 18.9% compared to last year's comparable quarter despite a nearly nine dollars per barrel increase in the cost of West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") during the fourth quarter. The segment's Adjusted EBITDA Margin for the fourth quarter was 9.8% versus 9.2% for the prior year comparable period, despite some additional charges associated with the ERP implementation. The segment also benefited from a $2.5 million favorable LCM inventory adjustment, which was partially offset by a $2.1 million LIFO inventory liquidation loss.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, total specialty products sales volumes decreased 3.8% year-over-year, driven primarily by supply-chain disruptions that took place in the third quarter and the lubes turnaround at Shreveport in the fourth quarter. Specialty products segment Adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly due to consistently rising feedstock costs throughout 2017 and decreased sales volumes, partially offset by record volume and profit performance in the higher-margin packaged and synthetic specialty products and record throughput at the Cotton Valley refinery. Specialty products segment gross profit per barrel during fiscal year 2017 of $33.93 was down slightly compared to 2016 gross profit per barrel of $34.57, primarily due to the increase in the price of crude. On an annual basis, the specialty products segment's Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 14.3% in 2017, compared to 15.1% in 2016, which was due to the higher price of crude and the additional charges associated with the ERP implementation. Specialty products segment performance for 2017 was also impacted by a $10.9 million favorable LCM inventory adjustment and a $3.0 million LIFO inventory liquidation loss.\nFuel Products Segment | Results Summary\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(Dollars in millions, except per barrel data)\nFuel products segment gross profit\n$\n33.1\n$\n13.2\n$\n179.0\n$\n48.2\nFuel products segment Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n10.7\n$\n3.2\n$\n127.8\n$\n(10.1)\nFuel products segment gross profit per barrel (excluding hedging activities)\n$\n4.07\n$\n1.19\n$\n4.61\n$\n0.96\nDuring the fourth quarter 2017, improved fuel products segment gross profit performance was driven primarily by a 41.3% year-over-year increase in the benchmark Gulf Coast 2/1/1 crack spread, better product mix, and improved distribution channels. Fuel products segment sales volumes decreased by 23.2% primarily as a result of the sale of the Partnership's Superior Refinery during the fourth quarter. Quarterly Adjusted EBITDA and gross profit per barrel materially increased relative to the year-ago period, driven by a year-over-year increase in benchmark refined product margins and improved local rack differentials, offset somewhat by lower volumes and the additional charges associated with the ERP implementation. Fuel products segment performance for the fourth quarter 2017 was also impacted by a favorable LCM inventory adjustment of $11.6 million and a LIFO inventory liquidation loss of $0.8 million.\nGross profit for the fiscal year increased by nearly 300% to $179.0 million, as average refining margins rebounded meaningfully from the prior year levels, and initiatives to improve fuels profitability at the Shreveport refinery led to better capture and record premium gasoline sales. Fuel products segment results for fiscal year 2017 were positively impacted by a 36.0% average year-over-year improvement in the benchmark Gulf Coast 2/1/1 crack spread, lower RFS compliance costs and record production and record Canadian crude runs at the Great Falls refinery, offset somewhat by the additional charges associated with the ERP implementation. For fiscal year 2017, total fuel products sales volumes were down slightly year-over-year. Also, the segment was impacted by a favorable LCM inventory adjustment of $19.7 million as well as a LIFO inventory liquidation loss of $0.7 million during fiscal year 2017.\nDiscontinued Operations Oilfield Services| Results Summary\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(Dollars in millions, except per barrel data)\nDiscontinued operations gross profit\n$\n10.0\n$\n8.0\n$\n60.5\n$\n22.0\nDiscontinued operations Adjusted EBITDA\n$\n(0.3)\n$\n(3.5)\n$\n2.9\n$\n(20.6)\nU.S. land-based rig counts continued to improve relative to 2016 levels, experiencing a 41.2% increase across 2017. The rise in land-based rig count caused quarterly gross profit to increase to $10.0 million, compared to $8.0 million in the fourth quarter 2016, despite only retaining the asset for a portion of the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA of ($0.3) million improved relative to the $3.5 million loss experienced in the prior year period, despite the negative impacts of a $1.6 million unfavorable LCM inventory adjustment, that outpaced the LCM adjustment from the prior-year period. For the full-year, segment gross profit increased 175.0% to $60.5 million, and annual Adjusted EBITDA improved markedly to $2.9 million compared to the $20.6 million loss exhibited in the year prior. Improved results were driven by increased drilling activity, and the continued benefits of cost-containment efforts by the business segment. Calumet sold the oilfield services segment on November 21, 2017 and thus results from this segment are now included in discontinued operations.\nPartnership Liquidity\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Partnership had availability under its revolving credit facility of approximately $252.0 million, based on a borrowing base of approximately $319.0 million, $67.3 million in outstanding standby letters of credit and $0.2 million in outstanding borrowings. In addition, the Partnership had $514.3 million of cash on hand (including $350.0 million of restricted cash held for the purpose of redeeming the senior secured notes) as of December 31, 2017. The Partnership believes it will continue to have sufficient liquidity from cash on hand, cash flow from operations, borrowing capacity and other means by which to meet its financial commitments, debt service obligations, contingencies and anticipated capital expenditures.\n2018 Outlook\nFor fiscal 2018, total capital spending is expected to be between $80 million and $90 million. Included in the forecast is maintenance capital, expected turnaround activity at the Great Falls and Shreveport refineries and smaller growth capital projects.\nThe Partnership remains on schedule to achieve the high end of its $150 million to $200 million in Adjusted EBITDA operations excellence initiative objectives by the end of 2018, with a projected $40 million to $50 million expected to be realized during fiscal year 2018. The Partnership is unable to provide a reconciliation of these projected Adjusted EBITDA amounts to projected net income (loss), the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, due to the unknown effect, timing and potential significance of certain income statement items.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Timing Expectations\nWest Griffin, Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer of Calumet, concluded, \"In regards to our first quarter filing expectations, we plan to issue our earnings release concurrent with the filing of the fiscal first quarter 10-Q. Our first priority is the integrity of our numbers; secondarily we will prioritize the timely reporting of our results.\"\n2018 Renewable Fuel Standard (\"RFS\") Compliance Impact Forecast\nThe Partnership records its outstanding Renewable Identification Numbers (\"RINs\") obligation as a balance sheet liability. This liability is marked-to-market on a quarterly basis to reflect the market price of RINs on the last day of each quarter. The Partnership expects its gross estimated annual RINs obligation, which includes RINs that are required to be secured through either blending or through the purchase of RINs in the open market, will be up to 85 million RINs for the full-year 2018, excluding the potential for any hardship waivers that may or may not be granted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") to any of the Partnership's fuel refineries at a later time. Calumet expects to be able to satisfy a portion of its 2018 gross RINs obligation through internal blending efforts.\nOperations Summary\nThe following table sets forth information about our combined operations, excluding the results of discontinued operations. Facility production volume differs from sales volume due to changes in inventories and the sale of purchased fuel product blendstocks such as ethanol and biodiesel and the resale of crude oil in our fuel products segment.\nThree Months Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\n(In bpd)\n(In bpd)\nTotal sales volume (1)\n111,522\n140,521\n132,082\n140,180\nTotal feedstock runs (2)\n108,415\n132,271\n128,624\n134,163\nFacility production: (3)\nSpecialty products:\nLubricating oils\n13,155\n15,373\n14,606\n14,697\nSolvents\n7,589\n6,901\n7,761\n7,427\nWaxes\n1,381\n1,728\n1,423\n1,571\nPackaged and synthetic specialty products (4)\n1,720\n1,816\n2,206\n1,777\nOther\n1,177\n1,835\n1,811\n1,850\nTotal\n25,022\n27,653\n27,807\n27,322\nFuel products:\nGasoline\n29,461\n39,719\n35,713\n37,713\nDiesel\n28,985\n33,670\n33,277\n34,808\nJet fuel\n4,054\n5,806\n5,368\n5,306\nAsphalt, heavy fuel oils and other\n22,550\n26,838\n29,396\n29,780\nTotal\n85,050\n106,033\n103,754\n107,607\nTotal facility production (3)\n110,072\n133,686\n131,561\n134,929\n(1)\nTotal sales volume includes sales from the production at our facilities and certain third-party facilities pursuant to supply and/or processing agreements, sales of inventories and the resale of crude oil to third party customers.

All comments concerning our expectations for future sales and operating results are based on our forecasts for our existing operations and do not include the potential impact of any future acquisitions. Our forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or projections.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date they are made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe include in this press release the non-GAAP financial measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. We provide reconciliations of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow to Net loss, our most directly comparable financial performance measure. We also provide a reconciliation of Distributable Cash Flow to Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, our most directly comparable liquidity measure. Both Net loss and Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities are calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\").\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Distributable Cash Flow and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are used as supplemental financial measures by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts and others, to assess:\nthe financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis;\nthe ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs and support our indebtedness;\nour operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in our industry, without regard to financing or capital structure; and\nthe viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to analysts and investors as they exclude transactions not related to our core cash operating activities and provide metrics to analyze our ability to pay distributions and interest costs. We believe that excluding these transactions allows investors to meaningfully analyze trends and performance of our core cash operations.\nWe define EBITDA for any period as net income (loss) plus interest expense (including debt issuance costs), income taxes and depreciation and amortization.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA for any period as: (1) net income (loss) plus (2)(a) interest expense (including debt issuance and extinguishment costs); (b) income taxes; (c) depreciation and amortization; (d) impairment; (e) unrealized losses from mark to market accounting for hedging activities; (f) realized gains under derivative instruments excluded from the determination of net income (loss); (g) non-cash equity-based compensation expense and other non-cash items (excluding items such as accruals of cash expenses in a future period or amortization of a prepaid cash expense) that were deducted in computing net income (loss); (h) debt refinancing fees, premiums and penalties, (i) any net loss realized in connection with an asset sale that was deducted in computing net income (loss) and (j) all extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring items of gain or loss, or revenue or expense; minus (3)(a) unrealized gains from mark to market accounting for hedging activities; (b) realized losses under derivative instruments excluded from the determination of net income and (c) other non-recurring expenses and unrealized items that reduced net income (loss) for a prior period, but represent a cash item in the current period.\nWe define Distributable Cash Flow for any period as Adjusted EBITDA less replacement and environmental capital expenditures, turnaround costs, cash interest expense (consolidated interest expense less non-cash interest expense), income (loss) from unconsolidated affiliates, net of cash distributions and income tax expense (benefit).\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by sales.\nThe definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow that are presented in this press release are consistent with the calculation of \"Consolidated Cash Flow\" contained in the indentures governing our 7.625% senior notes due January 15, 2022, that were issued in November 2013 (the \"2022 Notes\"), our 6.50% senior notes due April 15, 2021, that were issued in March 2014 (the \"2021 Notes\"), our 7.75% senior notes due April 15, 2023 (the \"2023 Notes\"), that were issued in March 2015 and our 11.50% senior secured notes due January 15, 2021 (the \"2021 Secured Notes\"), that were issued in April 2016. We are required to report Consolidated Cash Flow to the holders of our 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes, 2023 Notes and 2021 Secured Notes and Adjusted EBITDA to the lenders under our revolving credit facility, and these measures are used by them to determine our compliance with certain covenants governing those debt instruments. Please see our filings with the SEC, including our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, for additional details regarding the covenants governing our debt instruments.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow should not be considered alternatives to Net loss, Operating income (loss), Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. In evaluating our performance as measured by EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow, management recognizes and considers the limitations of these measurements. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect our obligations for the payment of income taxes, interest expense or other obligations such as capital expenditures. Accordingly, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow are only three of several measurements that management utilizes. Moreover, our EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow in the same manner. The following tables present a reconciliation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Distributable Cash Flow to Net loss, our most directly comparable GAAP financial performance measure, and Distributable Cash Flow to net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, our most directly comparable GAAP liquidity measure, for each of the periods indicated.\nCALUMET SPECIALTY PRODUCTS PARTNERS,
