    "text": "April 19, 2018 / 6:22 PM / Updated 27 minutes ago Canada energy minister: Ottawa still in talks with Kinder Morgan Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nOTTAWA, April 19 (Reuters) - Canada’s energy minister said on Thursday the government is talking to Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd on Trans Mountain and that nothing has changed after the company said Ottawa’s promise of financial support does not necessarily resolve the political risk around the pipeline. \nNatural Resources Minister Jim Carr told reporters that the government is treating the company’s May 31 deadline as real and that Kinder Morgan is feeling pressure from its investors.
