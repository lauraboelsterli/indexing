    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - The nerve agent used to poison former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter at his home in England last month was delivered in a liquid form, the BBC reported officials as saying.\nA parademic carries equipment near to where former Russian intelligence officer Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found poisoned in Salisbury, Britain, March 28, 2018. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia were found slumped on a bench in the city of Salisbury on March 4.\nBritain has blamed Russia for the attack which the authorities said was carried out using a Novichok form of nerve agent. Moscow denies the accusation and says Britain is trying to whip up anti-Russian hysteria.\nThe BBC said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs which is handling a clean-up operation in Salisbury had said a “very small amount” of Novichok was used with the substance delivered in a “liquid form”.\nPolice have previously said they believed the poison had been applied to the front door of Skripal’s modest home.\nYulia Skripal, 33, was discharged from hospital a week ago while her father is no longer in a critical condition.\nReporting by Michael Holden; editing by Stephen Addison\n ",
