    "text": "April 10 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc will build a $165 million next-generation biopharmaceutical plant adjacent to its existing West Greenwich, Rhode Island manufacturing campus, the state governor's office told Reuters on Tuesday.\nAmgen, headquartered in Thousand Oaks, California, in January announced plans to build a $300 million plant using new more flexible, reconfigurable technology in the United States, due in part to a lower effective tax rate stemming from U.S. tax reform.\nBecause the selected site is adjacent to an existing plant, the cost is now estimated at $165 million. The plant is expected to create at least 150 new manufacutring jobs, about half of Amgen's initial estimate of 300. (Reporting By Deena Beasley; Editing by David Gregorio)",
