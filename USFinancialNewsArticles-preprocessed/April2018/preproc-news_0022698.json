    "text": "April 9 (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Canada said on Monday its dividend payouts would not be affected by the suspension of works on C$7.4 billion ($5.8 billion) oil pipeline expansion.\nChief executive Steve Kean said on Sunday he would scrap plans to nearly triple the capacity of the Trans Mountain pipeline, unless legal challenges are resolved by May 31.\nThe pipeline carries crude from Albertaâ€™s oil sands to a facility in the Pacific province of British Columbia.
