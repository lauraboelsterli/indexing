    "text": "FINDLAY, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cooper Tire & Rubber Company (NYSE: CTB) today reported first quarter 2018 net income of $8 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.16, compared with $31 million, or $0.57 per share, for the same period last year.\nFirst Quarter Highlights:\nConsolidated unit volume decreased 6.1 percent compared to the prior year, with decreases in both the Americas and International segments. Net sales decreased 6.5 percent to $601 million. Operating profit was $26 million, or 4.4 percent of net sales, which is a decrease of $32 million from the prior year. The company repurchased $16 million of its common stock during the quarter at an average price of $33.15 per share.\n“Cooper’s first quarter U.S. volume performance was generally aligned with USTMA trends, which were weaker than expected due to slow consumer sell-out within the industry that continued from 2017,\" said Brad Hughes, President & Chief Executive Officer. \"The decrease in our first quarter operating profit, adjusted for one-time items, was more than explained by weaker volume and higher manufacturing costs as we made production adjustments to keep our inventories in line with current market conditions.\n“As the tire business navigates through current weak U.S. demand and raw material prices inch up, we expect our performance to be choppy in the months ahead. However, we believe that underlying macroeconomic factors support improvement in tire industry demand within the second half of this year. We expect that this, together with our initiatives to increase unit volumes and reduce costs, will drive improvements in our operating profit in the second half of the year. Our initiatives will be detailed at our investor event on May 11. Cooper has a strong brand with great consumer loyalty and we are poised to succeed when conditions improve and our efforts take hold.\n“We are pleased with the volume performance of our truck and bus radial tire (TBR) business, which was up 25 percent in the first quarter, well above the industry trend. In March, we announced a Cooper branded TBR product line to complement our successful Roadmaster brand, and it has been very well received. In addition, we are encouraged by the profitability within our International segment, which continues to grow and demonstrate the value of our flexible global footprint. In the long-term, we believe Cooper will continue to be a strong global tire competitor that delivers value to our shareholders.\"\nConsolidated Results:\nCooper Tire Q1 2018 ($M) Q1 2017 ($M) Change Net Sales $601 $643 (6.5)% Operating Profit $26 $58 (54.4)% Operating Margin 4.4% 9.0% (4.6) ppts. First quarter net sales were $601 million, a decrease of 6.5 percent compared with $643 million in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter net sales were negatively impacted by $39 million of lower unit volume and $20 million of unfavorable price and mix, partially offset by $17 million of favorable foreign currency impact.\nFirst quarter 2018 operating profit was $26 million compared with $58 million for the same period last year. Operating profit for 2017 has been restated to reclassify $9 million of other pension and postretirement benefit costs out of operating profit.\nOperating profit for the first quarter 2018 included $12 million of higher manufacturing costs and $11 million of lower unit volume. This was partially offset by $6 million of lower raw material costs, net of price and mix. Higher manufacturing costs reflect decisions to align production to demand and control inventory levels.\nThere were multiple unique items that impacted the comparison of first quarter 2018 to first quarter 2017. The non-recurrence of the Q1 2017 tariff reversal created an unfavorable variance of $22 million in the first quarter of this year. This was partially offset by $7 million of costs related to tornado damage at a North American distribution center in 2017 and $3 million of net insurance recoveries in the first quarter of 2018 related to that event.\nIn addition, there were $3 million of higher other costs in the quarter. Other costs included expenses related to workforce actions in the U.S. and Mexico as well as start-up costs related to two new U.S. distribution warehouses that will be operational this year.\nCooper's first quarter raw material index decreased 5.8 percent from the first quarter of 2017. The raw material index increased 2.3 percent sequentially from 153.1 in the fourth quarter of 2017 to 156.6 in the first quarter of 2018.\nThe effective tax rate for the first quarter was 27.8 percent, compared to 30.7 percent in the prior year. The first quarter 2018 tax rate includes discrete items related to the accrual of additional uncertain tax positions pertaining to previous years. The rate is based on forecasted annual earnings and tax rates for the various jurisdictions in which the company operates.\nAt quarter end, Cooper had $213 million in cash and cash equivalents, compared with $365 million at the end of the same period last year. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were $60 million compared with $45 million in the same period of last year.\nCooper generated a return on invested capital, excluding the impact of discrete tax items in the fourth quarter of 2017, of 12.3 percent for the trailing four quarters.\nIn February 2017, the company announced an increased and extended $300 million share repurchase program through December 2019. During the first quarter, 469,581 shares were repurchased for $16 million at an average price of $33.15 per share. Since share repurchases began in August 2014, the company has repurchased a total of 15.2 million shares at an average price of $34.38 per share.\nAmericas Tire Operations:\nAmericas Tire Operations Q1 2018 ($M) Q1 2017 ($M) Change Net Sales $485 $531 (8.7)% Operating Profit $31 $71 (55.9)% Operating Margin 6.4% 13.3% (6.9) ppts. First quarter net sales in the Americas segment declined 8.7 percent as a result of $30 million of lower unit volume, $19 million of unfavorable price and mix, and $3 million of favorable foreign currency impact. Segment unit volume decreased 5.6 percent from the prior year, with unit volume decreases in North America and Latin America.\nCooper’s first quarter total light vehicle tire shipments in the U.S. decreased 6.4 percent. The U.S. Tire Manufacturers Association (USTMA) reported that its member shipments of light vehicle tires in the U.S. were down 5.3 percent. Total industry shipments (including an estimate for non-USTMA members) decreased 1.9 percent for the period. The U.S. market performance reflected weaker than expected sell-out volume and corresponding pricing and promotional activity.\nFirst quarter operating profit was $31 million, or 6.4 percent of net sales, compared with $71 million, or 13.3 percent of net sales, a year ago. Operating profit for the first quarter was impacted by $10 million of lower unit volume, $12 million of unfavorable manufacturing costs, related to lower unit volumes, and $14 million of unfavorable price and mix, which was offset by favorable raw material costs of $14 million.\nAs mentioned previously, there were multiple unique items that impacted the quarter. The non-recurrence of the first quarter 2017 tariff reversal created an unfavorable variance of $22 million in the first quarter of this year. This was partially offset by $7 million of costs related to tornado damage at a North American distribution center in 2017 and $3 million of net insurance recoveries in the first quarter of 2018 related to that event.\nOther costs increased $6 million in the quarter, and included expenses related to workforce actions in Mexico as well as start-up costs related to two new U.S. distribution warehouses that will be operational in 2018.\nInternational Tire Operations:\nInternational Tire Operations Q1 2018 ($M) Q1 2017 ($M) Change Net Sales $161 $142 13.6% Operating Profit $7 $3 145.6% Operating Margin 4.6% 2.1% 2.5 ppts. First quarter net sales in the International segment increased 13.6 percent as a result of $13 million of favorable price and mix and $14 million of favorable foreign currency impact, partially offset by $8 million of lower unit volume. Segment unit volume decreased 5.4 percent from the prior year, driven by a unit volume decrease in Europe, which was partially offset by a slight increase in Asia unit volume.\nFirst quarter operating profit was $7 million, or 4.6 percent of net sales, compared with $3 million, or 2.1 percent of net sales, a year ago. The increase was driven by $6 million of favorable price and mix, which was partially offset by $1 million of lower unit volume. Other costs increased $1 million in the quarter.\nOutlook\n“Operating profit margin performance in the second quarter is expected to be similar to the first quarter, as we continue to navigate through a turbulent market environment. However, we expect industry demand to improve in the back half of the year. We expect that this, along with our actions to drive volume and reduce costs, will result in operating profit margin approaching our stated 9 percent to 11 percent range for the second half of 2018,” Hughes said. “In addition, with growth in the International segment, led by Asia, we expect Cooper to generate full-year unit volume growth on a consolidated basis compared to 2017.”\nAdditional management expectations for 2018 include:\nEffective tax rate in a range between 23 and 26 percent. Capital expenditures in a range between $200 and $220 million.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Conference Call Today at 10 a.m. Eastern\nManagement will discuss the financial and operating results for the first quarter, as well as the company’s business outlook, on a conference call for analysts and investors today at 10 a.m. EDT.

Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to measures used by other companies. As required by SEC rules, detailed reconciliations between the company’s GAAP and non-GAAP financial results are provided on the attached schedule. The company believes return on invested capital (“ROIC”) provides additional insight for analysts and investors in evaluating the company’s financial and operating performance. The company defines ROIC as the trailing four quarters’ after tax operating profit, utilizing the company's adjusted effective tax rate excluding discrete Q4 2017 tax items affecting comparability of results from period to period, divided by the total invested capital, which is the average of ending debt and equity for the last five quarters. The company believes ROIC is a useful measure of how effectively the company uses capital to generate profits.\nAbout Cooper Tire & Rubber Company\nCooper Tire & Rubber Company (NYSE: CTB) is the parent company of a global family of companies that specializes in the design, manufacture, marketing and sale of passenger car, light truck, medium truck, motorcycle and racing tires.

2017-07 on January 1, 2018, all net periodic pension benefit costs were included within operating profit. Prior year quarters have been adjusted to reflect the adoption of the new accounting standard. ** - Fourth quarter 2017 provision for income taxes included $35,378 of deemed repatriation tax and $20,413 for the re-measurement of deferred tax assets related to U.S. tax reform. Q4 2017 also included a U.K. valuation allowance charge of $18,915, less the reversal of an Asia valuation allowance of $6,672. These items have been excluded from the provision for income taxes as they are deemed to impact the comparability of results from period to period.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180430005192/en/\nCooper Tire & Rubber Company\nInvestor Contact:\nJerry Bialek, 419-424-4165\ninvestorrelations@coopertire.com\nor\nMedia Contact:\nAnne Roman, 419-429-7189\nalroman@coopertire.com\nSource: Cooper Tire & Rubber Company",
