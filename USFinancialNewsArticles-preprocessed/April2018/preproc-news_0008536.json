The exercises unnerved the West because of their scale, scope and what NATO said was a lack of transparency.\nAt a time of high East-West tensions, NATO officials worry that any accident involving military weapons and a civilian ship or plane could spark a wider conflict.\nMoscow accuses NATO of stirring up anti-Russian propaganda.\n“PROVOCATIVE ACTION” Latvia said Russian drills have never taken place so near its territory. Kucinskis noted that the decision to test so close to Latvian waters came after the West’s expulsion of Russian diplomats last month, the largest since the Cold War.\nThe diplomats were expelled after a nerve agent attack on March 4 against a former Russian double agent and his daughter in Salisbury, England. Britain, with strong Western backing, blames Russia for the poisoning. Moscow denies any involvement or wrongdoing.\nLatvian officials said Russia is not breaking any international rules and has the right to exercise. But the Latvian defence ministry summoned Russia’s military attache to express its concern and to raise the issue of the timing. Russia says it is testing its forces after the winter.\n“Drills lasting for three days in the region where there is very intensive aviation traffic, and given everything else that is happening in relations between the West and Russia, I think that it is a rather provocative action,” Latvia’s ambassador to Russia, Maris Riekstins, told Latvian Television.\nLatvia will raise the issue at a regular meeting of NATO envoys in Brussels next week, officials said.
