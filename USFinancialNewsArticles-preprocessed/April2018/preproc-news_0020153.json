    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Air France unions have agreed to meet management on Thursday to discuss wage demands after several days of strikes, a pilots union official said.\nA passenger walks as Air France planes are parked on the tarmac at Orly Airport near Paris as Air France pilots, cabin and ground crews unions call for a strike over salaries, France, April 10, 2018. REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes Strike notice could be withdrawn if a suitable offer was forthcoming, added the official.\nThe head of Air France-KLM ( AIRF.PA ) earlier on Wednesday denounced trade unionsâ€™ demands for a 6 percent pay increase as unrealistic, as the airline braced for the start of a seventh day of strikes that have hurt its financial performance.\nLate on Tuesday, Air France doubled the 1 percent immediate pay increase previously offered to unions and proposed talks on a deal for the 2019-21 period, in response to union demands for a 6 percent wage hike.\nReporting by Caroline Pailliez; Writing by Brian Love; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ",
