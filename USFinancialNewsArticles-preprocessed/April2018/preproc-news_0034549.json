    "text": "April 18, 2018 / 3:10 PM / Updated 10 minutes ago TREASURIES-Range-bound trade across bond maturities despite Wall St's gains Reuters Staff 5 Min Read By Kate Duguid NEW YORK, April 18 (New York) - - Trading across U.S. government bond maturities was range-bound on Wednesday, with yields little changed in spite of gains in the equity market. A sell-off at the front end of the curve caused two-year Treasury yields to rise from 2.386 percent at Tuesday's close to 2.423 on Wednesday morning. That move continued the flattening trend of the yield curve, as 10-year yields and 30-year yields both rose less than 3 basis points. The bigger moves at the front end were still minor, however, despite gains on Wall Street on strong corporate earnings. Bond yields are correlated with equity prices, as money will move out of fixed income when investments in stocks become more attractive. But despite the stock market's move higher this week, yields have not risen proportionally. \"The reaction in the bond market seems to be a lot more muted relative to the big moves we've seen in the equities rally in the past few sessions. Generally, the bond market seems to be under-reacting to both the sell-off and the rally,\" said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale in New York. The S&P 500 Index was up 11 basis points on Wednesday morning, bolstered by strong earnings from Morgan Stanley among others, which rose 3 percent after it reported a 40 percent jump in quarterly profit, driven by its trading business. Although disappointing earnings from IBM and a sell-off in semiconductor stocks weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq, both indexes were still up 1.2 percent and 2.1 percent this week respectively. \"I think bonds are resisting selling off too much because of the fact that global bond yields are still very low and that spread between Bunds and Treasuries is close to its widest levels, and thatâ€™s anchoring 10-year Treasury yields somewhat,\" said Rajappa. The spread between U.S. and German benchmark government bonds is -232.00 basis points, near the multi-year low of -237.30 hit on March 16. \"We really need to see a rise in global yields for Treasury yields to rise meaningfully from here,\" said Rajappa. The gap between short- and long-dated Treasuries is at its lowest in over a decade, which suggests the market anticipates the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates in 2018. The spread between two- and 10-year Treasuries is at 41.8 basis points, and the spread between five- and 30-year yields is at 29.8 basis points, both below Tuesday's close.
