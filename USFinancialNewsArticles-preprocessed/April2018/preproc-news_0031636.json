    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Celanese Corporation (NYSE: CE), a global technology and specialty materials company, today reported first quarter 2018 GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.68, its second highest ever, and record adjusted earnings per share of $2.79. Net sales in the quarter expanded 26 percent year over year to $1.9 billion. Growth in both Engineered Materials and the Acetyl Chain contributed to a robust quarter. Engineered Materials expanded earnings through pipeline commercialization and successful integration of recent acquisitions. The Acetyl Chain's expansive network and ability to respond quickly to improved industry utilization rates enabled it to leverage regional momentum to grow earnings meaningfully.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (As Adjusted) (unaudited) (In $ millions) Operating Profit (Loss) Engineered Materials 127 104 Acetate Tow 46 62 Acetyl Chain Industrial Specialties 23 25 Acetyl Intermediates 231 27 Eliminations (1 ) — Subtotal 253 52 Other Activities (83 ) (48 ) Total 343 170 Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (unaudited) (In $ millions, except per share data) Net Earnings (Loss) 365 184 Adjusted EBIT (1)(2) Engineered Materials 182 150 Acetate Tow 78 93 Acetyl Chain Industrial Specialties 23 25 Acetyl Intermediates 231 83 Eliminations (1 ) — Subtotal 253 108 Other Activities (39 ) (18 ) Total 474 333 Equity Earnings, Cost-Dividend Income, Other Income (Expense) Engineered Materials 54 43 Acetate Tow 32 29 Operating EBITDA (1) 553 404 Diluted EPS - continuing operations $ 2.68 $ 1.30 Diluted EPS - total $ 2.66 $ 1.30 Adjusted EPS (1) $ 2.79 $ 1.81 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (235 ) (64 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (2 ) (270 ) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 143 192 Free cash flow (1) 55 126 (1)\nSee \"Non-US GAAP Financial Measures\" below. (2)\nThe Company's discussion of adjusted earnings includes use of terms such as \"segment income\" and \"core income\". Those non-GAAP terms are defined below and reconciled in our Non-US GAAP Financial Measures and Supplemental Information document referenced below. First Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nCompleted the acquisition of Omni Plastics and its subsidiaries. Omni specializes in custom compounding of various engineered thermoplastic materials with a compounding facility and headquarters in Evansville, Indiana. Commercialized a record 742 projects in Engineered Materials in the first quarter of 2018, a 45 percent increase over the first quarter of last year. On-track to deliver approximately 3,000 project wins in 2018. Began the final, large scale installation of critical processing equipment associated with the 150 kt expansion of the Clear Lake, Texas VAM unit. Abandoned the joint venture agreement with Blackstone’s Rhodia Acetow business as parties were unable to reach an agreement with the European Commission on acceptable conditions. Received the 2018 ENERGY STAR® Partner of the Year Sustained Excellence Award for continued leadership and superior contributions to ENERGY STAR.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Business Segment Overview\nEngineered Materials (EM)\nEngineered Materials delivered record net sales of $665 million in the first quarter, 29 percent higher than the prior year. Both GAAP operating profit of $127 million and segment income of $182 million were all-time highs. Growth in adjusted earnings resulted from the success of the opportunity pipeline, growth in Asia, and recent acquisitions. A record 742 projects were commercialized in the quarter, 45 percent higher than the first quarter of 2017. Customers continue to value the project-based approach in EM that constantly matches Celanese's broad solution set and customer-specific needs to uncover opportunities for partnership. Volume in the first quarter of 2018 increased over last year primarily from the Nilit and Omni acquisitions. Operating profit and segment income margins were slightly lower than the same quarter last year, primarily due to acquisitions, while improving sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2017, and in-line with expectations for 2018. Affiliate earnings in Engineered Materials increased year over year to $54 million driven by Ibn Sina.\nAcetate Tow\nAcetate tow volume and price in the first quarter were lower than the same quarter last year due to unique positive carryovers from 2016 into the first quarter of 2017 as customers transitioned to new contracts that did not repeat in 2018. Affiliate earnings of $32 million were higher mainly due to favorable currency.\nAcetyl Chain\nThe Acetyl Chain recorded its highest ever net sales of over $1 billion, a 32 percent increase year over year. GAAP operating profit and core income of $253 million each, were both records. Operating profit expanded $201 million compared to the first quarter in 2017, while core income was $145 million higher. The business leveraged progressively improving industry fundamentals in the quarter to deliver a step-change in earnings growth. More opportunities were pursued to activate the expansive network and drive growth than any other previous quarter. Price and Volume increased year-over-year as a result of the improved industry utilization rates regionally and globally. Record margins of 24.1 percent were driven by higher acetic acid and derivative prices globally, led by China.\nCash Flow\nOperating cash flow in the first quarter was $143 million. Free cash flow was $55 million driven by timing of sales and collections, on-track for more than $900 million for 2018. Capital expenditures were $86 million in the quarter. Cash of $63 million was returned to shareholders in the quarter in the form of dividends.\nOutlook\n\"The first quarter of 2018 represents a combination of stronger industry fundamentals and the strength of our commercial models. In Engineered Materials, there is a continued need for customized solutions to reduce complexity for customers. The breadth of polymers and customer enabling competencies have made the business an important partner for our customers. In the Acetyl Chain, improving global supply and demand dynamics in the industry led by China, have raised base profitability levels. A very responsive commercial structure coupled with a global manufacturing footprint will continue to enable the Acetyl Chain in translating this momentum into earnings growth around the world. We believe that the improvement in the acetyls industry will be sustained in the longer term but expect some moderation in instantaneous utilization rates as we go through the year. The on-going success in our businesses gives us confidence that we can grow adjusted earnings per share by 20-25 percent in 2018,\" said Mark Rohr, chairman and chief executive officer.\nWe are unable to reconcile forecasted adjusted earnings per share growth to US GAAP diluted earnings per share without unreasonable efforts because a forecast of Certain Items, such as mark-to-market pension gains/losses, is not practical.\nThe Company's earnings presentation and prepared remarks related to the first quarter results will be posted on its website at www.celanese.com under Investor Relations/Events and Presentations after market close on April 16, 2018. Information about Non-US GAAP measures is included in a Non-US GAAP Financial Measures and Supplemental Information document posted on the website and available at the link below.

The Acetyl Chain includes the Company's Acetyl Intermediates segment and the Industrial Specialties segment.\nUse of Non-US GAAP Financial Information\nThis release uses the following Non-US GAAP measures: adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBIT margin, operating EBITDA, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. These measures are not recognized in accordance with US GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to US GAAP measures of performance or liquidity. The most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with US GAAP in our consolidated financial statements for adjusted EBIT and operating EBITDA is net earnings (loss) attributable to Celanese Corporation; for adjusted EBIT margin is operating margin; for adjusted earnings per share is earnings (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Celanese Corporation per common share-diluted; and for free cash flow is net cash provided by (used in) operations.\nDefinitions of Non-US GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBIT is a performance measure used by the Company and is defined by the Company as net earnings (loss) attributable to Celanese Corporation, plus (earnings) loss from discontinued operations, less interest income, plus interest expense, plus refinancing expense and taxes, and further adjusted for Certain Items (refer to Table 8 of our Non-US GAAP Financial Measures and Supplemental Information document). We do not provide reconciliations for adjusted EBIT on a forward-looking basis (including those contained in this document) when we are unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and amount of Certain Items, such as mark-to-market pension gains and losses, that have not yet occurred, are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Adjusted EBIT margin is defined by the Company as adjusted EBIT divided by net sales. Adjusted EBIT by core (i.e., the Acetyl Chain) may also be referred to by management as core income. Adjusted EBIT margin by core may also be referred to by management as core income margin. Adjusted EBIT by business segment may also be referred to by management as segment income. Adjusted EBIT margin by business segment may also be referred to by management as segment income margin. Operating EBITDA is a performance measure used by the Company and is defined by the Company as net earnings (loss) attributable to Celanese Corporation, plus (earnings) loss from discontinued operations, less interest income, plus interest expense, plus refinancing expense, taxes and depreciation and amortization, and further adjusted for Certain Items, which Certain Items include accelerated depreciation and amortization expense. Operating EBITDA is equal to adjusted EBIT plus depreciation and amortization. Adjusted earnings per share is a performance measure used by the Company and is defined by the Company as earnings (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Celanese Corporation, adjusted for income tax (provision) benefit, Certain Items, and refinancing and related expenses, divided by the number of basic common shares and dilutive restricted stock units and stock options calculated using the treasury method. We do not provide reconciliations for adjusted earnings per share on a forward-looking basis (including those contained in this document) when we are unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and amount of Certain Items, such as mark-to-market pension gains and losses, that have not yet occurred, are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.\nNote: The income tax expense (benefit) on Certain Items (\"Non-GAAP adjustments\") is determined using the applicable rates in the taxing jurisdictions in which the Non-GAAP adjustments occurred and includes both current and deferred income tax expense (benefit). The income tax rate used for adjusted earnings per share approximates the midpoint in a range of forecasted tax rates for the year. This range may include certain partial or full-year forecasted tax opportunities and related costs, where applicable, and specifically excludes changes in uncertain tax positions, discrete recognition of GAAP items on a quarterly basis, other pre-tax items adjusted out of our GAAP earnings for adjusted earnings per share purposes and changes in management's assessments regarding the ability to realize deferred tax assets for GAAP. In determining the adjusted earnings per share tax rate, we reflect the impact of foreign tax credits when utilized, or expected to be utilized, absent discrete events impacting the timing of foreign tax credit utilization. We analyze this rate quarterly and adjust it if there is a material change in the range of forecasted tax rates; an updated forecast would not necessarily result in a change to our tax rate used for adjusted earnings per share. The adjusted tax rate is an estimate and may differ from the actual tax rate used for GAAP reporting in any given reporting period. Table 3a of our Non-US GAAP Financial Measures and Supplemental Information document summarizes the reconciliation of our estimated GAAP effective tax rate to the adjusted tax rate. The estimated GAAP rate excludes discrete recognition of GAAP items due to our inability to forecast such items. As part of the year-end reconciliation, we will update the reconciliation of the GAAP effective tax rate to the adjusted tax rate for actual results. Free cash flow is a liquidity measure used by the Company and is defined by the Company as cash flow from operations, less capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment, and adjusted for capital contributions from or distributions to Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (\"Mitsui\") related to our methanol joint venture, Fairway Methanol LLC (\"Fairway\").\nReconciliation of Non-US GAAP Financial Measures\nReconciliations of the Non-US GAAP financial measures used in this press release to the comparable US GAAP financial measure, together with information about the purposes and uses of Non-US GAAP financial measures, are included in our Non-US GAAP Financial Measures and Supplemental Information document filed as an exhibit to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on or about April 16, 2018 and also available on our website at www.celanese.com under Financial Information, Non-GAAP Financial Measures, or at this link: http://investors.celanese.com/interactive/lookandfeel/4103411/Non-GAAP.PDF .\nResults Unaudited\nThe results in this document, together with the adjustments made to present the results on a comparable basis, have not been audited and are based on internal financial data furnished to management. Quarterly results should not be taken as an indication of the results of operations to be reported for any subsequent period or for the full fiscal year.\nSupplemental Information\nAdditional information about our prior period performance is included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and in our Non-US GAAP Financial Measures and Supplemental Information document.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations - Unaudited\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (As Adjusted) (In $ millions, except share and per\nshare data)\nNet sales 1,851 1,471 Cost of sales (1,336 ) (1,121 ) Gross profit 515 350 Selling, general and administrative expenses (147 ) (103 ) Amortization of intangible assets (6 ) (4 ) Research and development expenses (18 ) (17 ) Other (charges) gains, net — (55 ) Foreign exchange gain (loss), net (1 ) — Gain (loss) on disposition of businesses and assets, net — (1 ) Operating profit (loss) 343 170 Equity in net earnings (loss) of affiliates 58 47 Non-operating pension and other postretirement employee benefit (expense) income 26 22 Interest expense (33 ) (29 ) Interest income 2 — Dividend income - cost investments 32 29 Other income (expense), net 4 1 Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before tax 432 240 Income tax (provision) benefit (65 ) (56 ) Earnings (loss) from continuing operations 367 184 Earnings (loss) from operation of discontinued operations (2 ) — Income tax (provision) benefit from discontinued operations — — Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations (2 ) — Net earnings (loss) 365 184 Net (earnings) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (2 ) (1 ) Net earnings (loss) attributable to Celanese Corporation 363 183 Amounts attributable to Celanese Corporation Earnings (loss) from continuing operations 365 183 Earnings (loss) from discontinued operations (2 ) — Net earnings (loss) 363 183 Earnings (loss) per common share - basic Continuing operations 2.69 1.30 Discontinued operations (0.02 ) — Net earnings (loss) - basic 2.67 1.30 Earnings (loss) per common share - diluted Continuing operations 2.68 1.30 Discontinued operations (0.02 ) — Net earnings (loss) - diluted 2.66 1.30 Weighted average shares (in millions) Basic 135.9 140.6 Diluted 136.4 141.0 Consolidated Balance Sheets - Unaudited\nAs of As of March 31, December 31, 2018 2017 (In $ millions) ASSETS Current Assets Cash and cash equivalents 490 576 Trade receivables - third party and affiliates, net 1,205 986 Non-trade receivables, net 271 244 Inventories 955 900 Marketable securities, at fair value 32 32 Other assets 53 54 Total current assets 3,006 2,792 Investments in affiliates 979 976 Property, plant and equipment, net 3,801 3,762 Deferred income taxes 182 366 Other assets 369 338 Goodwill 1,107 1,003 Intangible assets, net 336 301 Total assets 9,780 9,538 LIABILITIES AND EQUITY Current Liabilities Short-term borrowings and current installments of long-term debt - third party and affiliates 425 326 Trade payables - third party and affiliates 797 807 Other liabilities 266 354 Income taxes payable 114 72 Total current liabilities 1,602 1,559 Long-term debt, net of unamortized deferred financing costs 3,343 3,315 Deferred income taxes 219 211 Uncertain tax positions 152 156 Benefit obligations 582 585 Other liabilities 217 413 Commitments and Contingencies Stockholders' Equity Preferred stock — — Common stock — — Treasury stock, at cost (2,031 ) (2,031 ) Additional paid-in capital 192 175 Retained earnings 5,220 4,920 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net (128 ) (177 ) Total Celanese Corporation stockholders' equity 3,253 2,887 Noncontrolling interests 412 412 Total equity 3,665 3,299 Total liabilities and equity 9,780 9,538 Non-US GAAP Financial Measures and Supplemental Information\nApril 16, 2018\nIn this document, the terms the \"Company,\" \"we\" and \"our\" refer to Celanese Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this document is to provide information of interest to investors, analysts and other parties including supplemental financial information and reconciliations and other information concerning our use of non-US GAAP financial measures. This document is updated quarterly.\nPresentation\nThis document presents the Company's four business segments, Engineered Materials, Acetate Tow, Industrial Specialties and Acetyl Intermediates, with one subtotal reflecting our core, the Acetyl Chain, which is based on similarities among customers, business models and technical processes. The Acetyl Chain includes the Company's Industrial Specialties segment and Acetyl Intermediates segment.\nUse of Non-US GAAP Financial Measures\nFrom time to time, management may publicly disclose certain numerical \"non-GAAP financial measures\" in the course of our earnings releases, financial presentations, earnings conference calls, investor and analyst meetings and otherwise. For these purposes, the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") defines a \"non-GAAP financial measure\" as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes amounts, or is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude amounts, included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with US GAAP, and vice versa for measures that include amounts, or are subject to adjustments that effectively include amounts, that are excluded from the most directly comparable US GAAP measure so calculated and presented. For these purposes, \"GAAP\" refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.\nNon-GAAP financial measures disclosed by management are provided as additional information to investors, analysts and other parties because the Company believes them to be important supplemental measures for assessing our financial and operating results and as a means to evaluate our financial condition and period-to-period comparisons. These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplemental to, and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to, net earnings (loss), operating profit (loss), operating margin, cash flow from operating activities (together with cash flow from investing and financing activities), earnings per share or any other US GAAP financial measure. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered within the context of our complete audited and unaudited financial results for the given period, which are available on the Investor Relations/Financial Information/SEC Filings page of our website, www.celanese.com . The definition and method of calculation of the non-GAAP financial measures used herein may be different from other companies' methods for calculating measures with the same or similar titles. Investors, analysts and other parties should understand how another company calculates such non-GAAP financial measures before comparing the other company's non-GAAP financial measures to any of our own. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be indicative of the historical operating results of the Company nor are they intended to be predictive or projections of future results.\nPursuant to the requirements of SEC Regulation G, whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also present in this document, in the presentation itself or on a Form 8-K in connection with the presentation on the Investor Relations/Financial Information/Non-GAAP Financial Measures page of our website, www.celanese.com , to the extent practicable, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure we reference and such comparable GAAP financial measure.\nThis document includes definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures used from time to time by the Company.\nSpecific Measures Used\nThis document provides information about the following non-GAAP measures: adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBIT margin, operating EBITDA, operating EBITDA margin, operating profit (loss) attributable to Celanese Corporation, adjusted earnings per share, net debt, free cash flow and return on invested capital (adjusted). The most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with US GAAP in our consolidated financial statements for adjusted EBIT and operating EBITDA is net earnings (loss) attributable to Celanese Corporation; for adjusted EBIT margin and operating EBITDA margin is operating margin; for operating profit (loss) attributable to Celanese Corporation is operating profit (loss); for adjusted earnings per share is earnings (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Celanese Corporation per common share-diluted; for net debt is total debt; for free cash flow is net cash provided by (used in) operations; and for return on invested capital (adjusted) is net earnings (loss) attributable to Celanese Corporation divided by the sum of the average of beginning and end of the year short- and long-term debt and Celanese Corporation stockholders' equity.\nDefinitions\nAdjusted EBIT is a performance measure used by the Company and is defined by the Company as net earnings (loss) attributable to Celanese Corporation, plus (earnings) loss from discontinued operations, less interest income, plus interest expense, plus refinancing expense and taxes, and further adjusted for Certain Items (refer to Table 8). We believe that adjusted EBIT provides transparent and useful information to management, investors, analysts and other parties in evaluating and assessing our primary operating results from period-to-period after removing the impact of unusual, non-operational or restructuring-related activities that affect comparability. Our management recognizes that adjusted EBIT has inherent limitations because of the excluded items. Adjusted EBIT is one of the measures management uses for planning and budgeting, monitoring and evaluating financial and operating results and as a performance metric in the Company's incentive compensation plan. We do not provide reconciliations for adjusted EBIT on a forward-looking basis (including those contained in this document) when we are unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and amount of Certain Items, such as mark-to-market pension gains and losses, that have not yet occurred, are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Adjusted EBIT margin is defined by the Company as adjusted EBIT divided by net sales. Adjusted EBIT margin has the same uses and limitations as Adjusted EBIT. Adjusted EBIT by core (i.e. the Acetyl Chain) may also be referred to by management as core income. Adjusted EBIT margin by core may also be referred to by management as core income margin. Adjusted EBIT by business segment may also be referred to by management as segment income. Adjusted EBIT margin by business segment may also be referred to by management as segment income margin. Operating EBITDA is a performance measure used by the Company and is defined by the Company as net earnings (loss) attributable to Celanese Corporation, plus (earnings) loss from discontinued operations, less interest income, plus interest expense, plus refinancing expense, taxes and depreciation and amortization, and further adjusted for Certain Items, which Certain Items include accelerated depreciation and amortization expense. Operating EBITDA is equal to adjusted EBIT plus depreciation and amortization. We believe that Operating EBITDA provides transparent and useful information to investors, analysts and other parties in evaluating our operating performance relative to our peer companies. Operating EBITDA margin is defined by the Company as Operating EBITDA divided by net sales. Operating EBITDA margin has the same uses and limitations as Operating EBITDA. Operating profit (loss) attributable to Celanese Corporation is defined by the Company as operating profit (loss), less earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (\"NCI\"). We believe that operating profit (loss) attributable to Celanese Corporation provides transparent and useful information to management, investors, analysts and other parties in evaluating our core operational performance. Operating margin attributable to Celanese Corporation is defined by the Company as operating profit (loss) attributable to Celanese Corporation divided by net sales. Operating margin attributable to Celanese Corporation has the same uses and limitations as Operating profit (loss) attributable to Celanese Corporation. Adjusted earnings per share is a performance measure used by the Company and is defined by the Company as earnings (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Celanese Corporation, adjusted for income tax (provision) benefit, Certain Items, and refinancing and related expenses, divided by the number of basic common shares and dilutive restricted stock units and stock options calculated using the treasury method. We believe that adjusted earnings per share provides transparent and useful information to management, investors, analysts and other parties in evaluating and assessing our primary operating results from period-to-period after removing the impact of the above stated items that affect comparability and as a performance metric in the Company's incentive compensation plan. We do not provide reconciliations for adjusted earnings per share on a forward-looking basis (including those contained in this document) when we are unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing and amount of Certain Items, such as mark-to-market pension gains and losses, that have not yet occurred, are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information.\nNote: The income tax expense (benefit) on Certain Items (\"Non-GAAP adjustments\") is determined using the applicable rates in the taxing jurisdictions in which the Non-GAAP adjustments occurred and includes both current and deferred income tax expense (benefit). The income tax rate used for adjusted earnings per share approximates the midpoint in a range of forecasted tax rates for the year. This range may include certain partial or full-year forecasted tax opportunities and related costs, where applicable, and specifically excludes changes in uncertain tax positions, discrete recognition of GAAP items on a quarterly basis, other pre-tax items adjusted out of our GAAP earnings for adjusted earnings per share purposes and changes in management's assessments regarding the ability to realize deferred tax assets for GAAP. In determining the adjusted earnings per share tax rate, we reflect the impact of foreign tax credits when utilized, or expected to be utilized, absent discrete events impacting the timing of foreign tax credit utilization. We analyze this rate quarterly and adjust it if there is a material change in the range of forecasted tax rates; an updated forecast would not necessarily result in a change to our tax rate used for adjusted earnings per share. The adjusted tax rate is an estimate and may differ from the actual tax rate used for GAAP reporting in any given reporting period. Table 3a summarizes the reconciliation of our estimated GAAP effective tax rate to the adjusted tax rate. The estimated GAAP rate excludes discrete recognition of GAAP items due to our inability to forecast such items. As part of the year-end reconciliation, we will update the reconciliation of the GAAP effective tax rate to the adjusted tax rate for actual results. Free cash flow is a liquidity measure used by the Company and is defined by the Company as net cash provided by (used in) operations, less capital expenditures on property, plant and equipment, and adjusted for capital contributions from or distributions to Mitsui & Co., Ltd. (\"Mitsui\") related to our methanol joint venture, Fairway Methanol LLC (\"Fairway\"). We believe that free cash flow provides useful information to management, investors, analysts and other parties in evaluating the Company's liquidity and credit quality assessment because it provides an indication of the long-term cash generating ability of our business. Although we use free cash flow as a measure to assess the liquidity generated by our business, the use of free cash flow has important limitations, including that free cash flow does not reflect the cash requirements necessary to service our indebtedness, lease obligations, unconditional purchase obligations or pension and postretirement funding obligations.\nSupplemental Information\nSupplemental Information we believe to be of interest to investors, analysts and other parties includes the following:\nFor those consolidated ventures in which the Company owns or is exposed to less than 100% of the economics, the outside stockholders' interests are shown as NCI. Beginning in 2014, this includes Fairway for which the Company's ownership percentage is 50%. Amounts referred to as \"attributable to Celanese Corporation\" are net of any applicable NCI.\nRecent Developments\nEffective January 1, 2018, we reorganized our operating and reportable segments to align with recent structural and management reporting changes. The change reflects the movement of our food ingredients business from the Consumer Specialties reportable segment into the Engineered Materials reportable segment. The former Consumer Specialties reportable segment is being renamed the Acetate Tow segment and the former Advanced Engineered Materials reportable segment is being renamed the Engineered Materials segment. This reorganization better reflects how we manage our food ingredients' related products commercially. Engineered Materials and food ingredients are both project-based models which focus on delivering customized solutions and are led by the same senior management team. These changes in operating and reportable segments were applied retrospectively to prior periods through 2014.\nResults Unaudited\nThe results in this document, together with the adjustments made to present the results on a comparable basis, have not been audited and are based on internal financial data furnished to management. Quarterly results should not be taken as an indication of the results of operations to be reported for any subsequent period or for the full fiscal year.\nTable 1\nAdjusted EBIT and Operating EBITDA - Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures - Unaudited\nQ1 '18 2017 Q4 '17 Q3 '17 Q2 '17 Q1 '17 (In $ millions) Net earnings (loss) attributable to Celanese Corporation 363 843 203 226 231 183 (Earnings) loss from discontinued operations 2 13 1 4 8 — Interest income (2 ) (2 ) — (1 ) (1 ) — Interest expense 33 122 31 32 30 29 Refinancing expense — — — — — — Income tax provision (benefit) 65 213 60 57 40 56 Certain Items attributable to Celanese Corporation (Table 8)\n13 167 57 27 18 65 Adjusted EBIT 474 1,356 352 345 326 333 Depreciation and amortization expense (1) 79 303 79 78 75 71 Operating EBITDA\n553 1,659 431 423 401 404 Q1 '18\n2017\nQ4 '17\nQ3 '17\nQ2 '17\nQ1 '17\n(In $ millions) Engineered Materials — — — — — — Acetate Tow — — — — — — Industrial Specialties — 2 — 2 — — Acetyl Intermediates — — — — — — Other Activities (2) — — — — — — Accelerated depreciation and amortization expense — 2 — 2 — — Depreciation and amortization expense (1) 79 303 79 78 75 71 Total depreciation and amortization expense 79 305 79 80 75 71 (1) Excludes accelerated depreciation and amortization expense as detailed in the table above, which amounts are included in Certain Items above.
