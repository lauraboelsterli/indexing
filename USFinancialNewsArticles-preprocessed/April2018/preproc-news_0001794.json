    "text": "April 4, 2018 / 5:11 PM / Updated 41 minutes ago Ford Motor urges U.S., China to resolve trade issues Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nApril 4 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Wednesday said it encouraged the U.S. and Chinese governments to “work together to resolve issues” after China retaliated against U.S. plans to impose tariffs with a list of similar duties. \n“We encourage both governments to work together to resolve issues between these two important economies,” Ford said in a statement. \nResponding to tariffs imposed by the Trump government less than 11 hours later, China issued a list of duties on key American imports including soybeans, planes, cars, beef and chemicals in a move that sent global markets lower.
