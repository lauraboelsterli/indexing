    "text": "BETHESDA, Md., April 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eagle Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:EGBN), the parent company of EagleBank, today announced record quarterly net income of $35.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 (basic and diluted earnings per common share of $1.04), a 32% increase over the $27.0 million net income (basic and diluted earnings per common share of $0.79) for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\n“We are very pleased to report another quarter of favorable earnings, which continued to exhibit positive trends of balance sheet growth, revenue growth, solid asset quality and favorable operating leverage,” noted Ronald D. Paul, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Eagle Bancorp, Inc. Mr. Paul continued, “The Company’s assets ended the quarter at $7.7 billion, representing 9% growth over the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 earnings resulted in a return on average assets of 1.91% and a return on average common equity (“ROACE”) of 14.99%.” Mr. Paul added, “We believe our financial results in the first quarter continue to exhibit balanced and consistent performance across all financial measures.”\nThe Company’s performance in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017 was highlighted by growth in average total loans of 13%, growth in average total deposits of 9%, by an increase in the net interest margin to 4.17% from 4.14% and by 11% growth in total revenue to $81.1 million. Mr. Paul noted that the Company focuses more on growth of average balances year over year since that measure relates more directly to income statement results. For the first quarter of 2018, the annualized net charge-off ratio to average loans was 0.06%; the level of nonperforming assets to total assets remained low at 0.19% and the Company’s operating leverage remained very strong with an efficiency ratio of 38.38%. Mr. Paul added, “In the first quarter of 2018, total loans grew 3.0% over December 31, 2017, and total deposits increased 4.6% over December 31, 2017. The pipeline of loan commitments and new relationship opportunities remains strong. The Company continues to emphasize strategies and focus on achieving core deposit growth. Importantly, the mix of noninterest deposits to total deposits averaged 33.5% in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to 32.3% for the first quarter of 2017.”\nThe net interest margin was 4.17% for the first quarter of 2018, up four basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017 and three basis points higher than the first quarter in 2017 due substantially to a higher percentage of loans in the asset mix, coupled with higher loan yields. Mr. Paul noted, “While we are seeing a higher cost of funds, we are also experiencing improved loan yields, in part due to rate adjustments on our predominately variable and adjustable rate loan portfolio.” The Company’s net interest income increased 13% in the first quarter of 2018 over 2017 as the Company continues to see good lending opportunities and has continued its emphasis on disciplined pricing for both new loans and funding sources. The Company believes that it has a superior net interest margin compared to peers, but it is also focused on all factors that contribute to Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) growth.\nTotal revenue (net interest income plus noninterest income) for the first quarter of 2018 was $81.1 million, or 11% above the $73.0 million of total revenue earned for the first quarter of 2017. The primary driver of revenue growth for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017 was net interest income growth of 13% ($75.8 million versus $66.9 million). Noninterest income declined in the first quarter 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, due substantially to lower net investment gains and lower gains on sales of loans in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to 2017. Excluding net gains on sales of investment securities, noninterest income was $5.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $5.6 million for the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of 5%.\nWhile the Company’s primary focus continues to be on generating spread income, management also looks to the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans, Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loan activity and FHA Multifamily lending and securitization as components of the Company’s ongoing noninterest income initiatives. For the first quarter of 2018, gains on the sale of residential mortgage loans were $1.4 million as compared to $2.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. The lesser revenue was due to lower volumes. Sales of SBA guaranteed loans resulted in modest gains of $169 thousand on sales for the first quarter of 2018 versus $57 thousand for the same period in 2017. Gains on sales of FHA multifamily loans in the first quarter of 2018 were $48 thousand versus no revenue in the first quarter of 2017.\nAsset quality measures remained solid at March 31, 2018. Annualized net charge-offs were 0.06% of average loans for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to 0.04% of average loans for the first quarter of 2017. At March 31, 2018, the Company’s nonperforming loans amounted to $13.4 million (0.20% of total loans) as compared to $14.4 million (0.25% of total loans) at March 31, 2017 and $13.2 million (0.21% of total loans) at December 31, 2017. Nonperforming assets amounted to $14.8 million (0.19% of total assets) at March 31, 2018 compared to $15.7 million (0.22% of total assets) at March 31, 2017 and $14.6 million (0.20% of total assets) at December 31, 2017.\nManagement continues to remain attentive to any signs of deterioration in borrowers’ financial conditions and is proactive in taking the appropriate steps to mitigate risk, including placing loans on nonaccrual status. Based on a thorough risk analysis and consistent application of allowance methodology, management believes that its allowance for credit losses, at 1.00% of total loans (excluding loans held for sale) at March 31, 2018, is adequate to absorb potential credit losses within the loan portfolio at that date. The allowance for credit losses was 1.03% at March 31, 2017 and 1.01% of total loans at December 31, 2017. The allowance for credit losses represented 492% of nonperforming loans at March 31, 2018, as compared to 417% at March 31, 2017 and 489% at December 31, 2017.\n“The Company’s productivity remained quite strong in the quarter,” noted Mr. Paul. The efficiency ratio of 38.38% reflects management’s ongoing efforts to maintain superior operating leverage. Further, the annualized level of noninterest expenses as a percentage of average assets has declined to 1.64% in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to 1.73% in the first quarter of 2017. The Company’s goal is to maximize operating performance without inhibiting growth or negatively impacting our ability to service our customers. Mr. Paul further noted, “Our favorable efficiency ratio is due in a large part to our streamlined branch system and control of occupancy costs. We maintain $298 million of average deposits per branch as compared to the regional average of $125 million per branch.”\nTotal assets at March 31, 2018 were $7.70 billion, a 9% increase as compared to $7.09 billion at March 31, 2017, and a 3% increase as compared to $7.48 billion at December 31, 2017. Total loans (excluding loans held for sale) were $6.60 billion at March 31, 2018, a 13% increase as compared to $5.82 billion at March 31, 2017, and a 3% increase as compared to $6.41 billion at December 31, 2017. Loans held for sale amounted to $25.9 million at March 31, 2018 as compared to $29.6 million at March 31, 2017, a 13% decrease, and $25.1 million at December 31, 2017, a 3% increase. The investment portfolio totaled $578.3 million at March 31, 2018, a 16% increase from the $499.8 million balance at March 31, 2017. As compared to December 31, 2017, the investment portfolio at March 31, 2018 decreased by $11.0 million or 2%.\nTotal deposits at March 31, 2018 were $6.12 billion compared to deposits of $5.79 billion at March 31, 2017, a 6% increase and $5.85 billion at December 31, 2017, a 5% increase. We continue to work on expanding the breadth and depth of our existing customer relationships while we pursue new relationships. Total borrowed funds (excluding customer repurchase agreements) were $492.0 million at March 31, 2018, $291.6 million at March 31, 2017 and $541.9 million at December 31, 2017.\nTotal shareholders’ equity at March 31, 2018 increased 13%, to $985.2 million, compared to $873.0 million at March 31, 2017, and increased 4%, from $950.4 million, at December 31, 2017. The increase in shareholders’ equity at March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 was primarily the result of retained earnings. The Company’s capital position remains substantially in excess of regulatory requirements for well capitalized status, with a total risk based capital ratio of 15.32% at March 31, 2018, as compared to 14.97% at March 31, 2017, and 15.02% at December 31, 2017. In addition, the tangible common equity ratio was 11.57% at March 31, 2018, compared to 10.97% at March 31, 2017 and 11.44% at December 31, 2017.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported an annualized ROAA of 1.91% as compared to 1.62% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The annualized ROACE for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was 14.99% as compared to 12.74% for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nNet interest income increased 13% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 over the same period in 2017 ($75.8 million versus $66.9 million), resulting from growth in average earning assets of 13%. The net interest margin was 4.17% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to 4.14% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The Company believes its current net interest margin remains favorable compared to peer banking companies and that its disciplined approach to managing the loan portfolio yield to 5.30% for the first quarter of 2018 (as compared to 5.13% for the same period in 2017) has been a significant factor in its overall profitability.\nThe provision for credit losses was $2.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The higher provisioning in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the first quarter of 2017, is due to higher loan growth coupled with higher net charge-offs. Net charge-offs of $921 thousand in the first quarter of 2018 represented an annualized 0.06% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, as compared to $623 thousand, or an annualized 0.04% of average loans, excluding loans held for sale, in the first quarter of 2017. Net charge-offs in the first quarter of 2018 were attributable primarily to commercial loans ($981 thousand) and commercial real estate loans ($61 thousand) offset by a net recovery in consumer loans ($120 thousand).\nNoninterest income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased to $5.3 million from $6.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, a 13% decrease, due substantially to lower net investment gains in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to 2017 and due to lower gains on the sale of residential mortgage loans ($1.4 million versus $2.0 million) resulting from lower volume. Residential mortgage loans closed were $100 million for the first quarter of 2018 versus $150 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net investment gains were $42 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $505 thousand for the same period in 2017.\nThe efficiency ratio, which measures the ratio of noninterest expense to total revenue, was 38.38% for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to 40.06% for the first quarter of 2017. Noninterest expenses totaled $31.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $29.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, a 6% increase.\nCost increases for salaries and benefits were $181 thousand, due primarily to increased staff and merit increases. Data processing expense increased by $276 thousand due primarily to increased vendor fees associated with higher volumes and rates. Legal, accounting and professional fees increased $2.0 million, a significant portion of which was due to independent consulting and professional services associated with the internet event late in 2017. FDIC expenses increased $131 thousand due to a higher assessment base resulting from growth in total assets. Other expenses decreased $795 thousand, due primarily to a net loss on the sale of Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) in the first quarter of 2017 ($361 thousand), lower business development expenses ($172 thousand), and lower costs to maintain OREO properties pending sale ($90 thousand).\nThe effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 25.6% as compared to 36.2% for the first quarter of 2017 due largely to a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% pursuant to The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nThe financial information which follows provides more detail on the Company’s financial performance for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017 as well as providing eight quarters of trend data. Persons wishing additional information should refer to the Company’s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).\nAbout Eagle Bancorp: The Company is the holding company for EagleBank, which commenced operations in 1998.

The Company calculates the tangible common equity ratio by excluding the balance of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity and dividing by tangible assets. The Company calculates tangible book value per common share by dividing tangible common equity by common shares outstanding, as compared to book value per common share, which the Company calculates by dividing common shareholders' equity by common shares outstanding. The Company considers this information important to shareholders as tangible equity is a measure that is consistent with the calculation of capital for bank regulatory purposes, which excludes intangible assets from the calculation of risk based ratios and as such is useful for investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate capital adequacy and to compare against other financial institutions. The table below provides a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures with financial measures defined by GAAP.\nGAAP Reconciliation (Unaudited) (dollars in thousands except per share data) Three Months Ended Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Common shareholders' equity $ 985,180 $ 873,042 Less: Intangible assets (107,097 ) (107,124 ) Tangible common equity $ 878,083 $ 765,918 Book value per common share $ 28.72 $ 25.59 Less: Intangible book value per common share (3.12 ) (3.14 ) Tangible book value per common share $ 25.60 $ 22.45 Total assets $ 7,698,060 $ 7,090,163 Less: Intangible assets (107,097 ) (107,124 ) Tangible assets $ 7,590,963 $ 6,983,039 Tangible common equity ratio 11.57 % 10.97 % (2) Computed by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income.\n(3) Excludes loans held for sale.\nEagle Bancorp, Inc.

The Company calculates the tangible common equity ratio by excluding the balance of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity and dividing by tangible assets. The Company calculates tangible book value per common share by dividing tangible common equity by common shares outstanding, as compared to book value per common share, which the Company calculates by dividing common shareholders' equity by common shares outstanding. The Company considers this information important to shareholders as tangible equity is a measure that is consistent with the calculation of capital for bank regulatory purposes, which excludes intangible assets from the calculation of risk based ratios and as such is useful for investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate capital adequacy and to compare against other financial institutions. (2) Computed by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income. (3) Excludes loans held for sale.\nEAGLE BANCORP, INC.\nCONTACT:\nMichael T.
