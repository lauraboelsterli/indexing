FILE PHOTO: Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani speaks during a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin in Moscow, Russia March 26, 2018. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin \n“The leaders discussed Iran’s increasingly reckless behaviour in the region and the threat it poses to regional stability,” the White House said in a statement. Trump emphasized to the emir “that it is critical to end the Gulf dispute,” it said. \nThe White House said Trump spoke on Monday with King Salman of Saudi Arabia about the split in the Gulf Cooperation Council, as well as other regional issues, including Syria and Yemen.
