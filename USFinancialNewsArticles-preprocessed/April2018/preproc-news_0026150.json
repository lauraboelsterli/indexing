    "text": "facebook email copy link \nLeah Millis/Reuters Mark Zuckerberg has agreed to meet with Andrus Ansip, the European Union's digital chief, on Tuesday following Facebook's privacy scandal with Cambridge Analytica. Ansip will also meet with Google CEO Sundar Pichai to discuss issues such as data protection, online privacy, and fake news. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg spoke to a justice counterpart of Ansip's last week in what was described as an open and constructive discussion. \nThe European Union's digital chief will meet with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in San Francisco as the world's largest social network faces increasing scrutiny over its use of personal data. \nPrivacy concerns have swamped Facebook since it acknowledged last month that information about millions of users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, a firm that has counted U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 electoral campaign among its clients. \nAndrus Ansip, European Commission Vice President in charge of digital issues will meet with Zuckerberg on Tuesday, as well as meeting with Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, to discuss issues such as data protection, online privacy, illegal content and fake news. \nFacebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg spoke to Ansip's justice counterpart last week in what was described as an open and constructive discussion. \nA tough new EU data protection law entering into force on May 25 has acquired new prominence following the Cambridge Analytica scandal, with European policymakers saying it will set a standard worldwide. \nZuckerberg has also been asked to speak before the European Parliament to explain how Europeans' Facebook data may have been misused.",
