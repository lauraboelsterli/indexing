    "text": "(Reuters) - Reuters covers dozens of high-profile Congressional hearings each year, but few draw the intensity and urgency of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s visit to Capitol Hill this week.\nFILE PHOTO: Silhouettes of mobile users are seen next to a screen projection of Facebook logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File photo Zuckerberg was in Washington, D.C., to answer lawmakers’ questions about data privacy in the wake of revelations that millions of users’ personal information was harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that has counted U.S. President Donald Trump’s election campaign among its clients.\nAt least 70 Reuters journalists covered the hearings from every angle and across all platforms. Mobile readers, for example, received push alerts as soon as the hearings began, and the Reuters live blog monitored Zuckerberg’s comments in real-time, curated by social media editor Jamillah Knowles.\nThe markets team in the United States and Bangalore monitored Facebook’s stock performance.\nLess than 20 minutes after Zuckerberg started his Senate testimony on Tuesday, Reuters TV published a video about the hearings and subsequently produced seven other segments relating to Zuckerberg’s comments. Overall, some 10,000 people viewed Reuters’ live stream of the hearing on Tuesday.\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg listens while testifying before a joint Senate Judiciary and Commerce Committees hearing regarding the company’s use and protection of user data, on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., April 10, 2018. REUTERS/Leah Millis To our readers, from the Editor-in-Chief Read about Reuters Backstory and the Trust Principles We used Twitter to share some 150 tweets about the two days of testimony to various Reuters social media accounts.\nAnd, we also covered Facebook on Facebook. As Zuckerberg spoke to the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Wednesday, our Facebook audience griped about the legislative process.\nA commentary piece by Jess Kimball Leslie about Facebook haters drew this comment from a follower, “If they keep up the censorship, I guarantee I will be using an alternative means to connect with people.”\nReporting by Lauren Young; Editing by Toni Reinhold\n ",
