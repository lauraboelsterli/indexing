    "text": "Todd Frazier collected three RBIs and gave the New York Mets a lead they would never relinquish with a two-run double in the first inning Saturday afternoon, when the Mets cruised to a 6-2 win over the St. Louis Cardinals at Citi Field.\nThe Mets scored with one out in the first against Cardinals right hander Michael Wacha, who gave up a leadoff double to Asdrubal Cabrera and walked Yoenis Cespedes before giving up Frazier’s double.\nCabrera had three hits, including an eighth-inning RBI double, while Cespedes and Travis d’Arnaud each hit solo homers for the Mets, who improved to 2-0 for the first time since 2013.\nJuan Lagares added two hits for New York.\nJacob deGrom, the only member of the Mets rotation who escaped injury last year, earned the win after allowing one run on four hits and one walk while striking out seven over 5 2/3 innings.\nThree pitchers combined to limit the Cardinals to one run over the final 3 1/3 frames. Jeurys Familia recorded his first save with a pair of strikeouts in 1 1/3 hitless innings. It was the first time Familia recorded more than three outs in a save since he got the final four outs on June 24, 2016.\nFamilia entered in the eighth because right hander Anthony Swarzak exited with a sore left oblique.\nJose Martinez had an RBI single in the fourth while Matt Carpenter lofted a solo homer in the eighth for the Cardinals, who are 0-2 for the first time since 2016. Martinez and Yadier Molina each had two hits. Martinez is 5-for-7 on the young season.\nWacha took the loss after allowing four runs on five hits and two walks while striking out two over 4 2/3 innings.\nLeft hander Ryan Sherriff, the third of five Cardinals pitchers, made his season debut by allowing one run over one-third of an inning. Sherriff was recalled from Triple-A Memphis prior to the game to replace Brett Cecil, who was placed on the disabled list with a strained left shoulder.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
