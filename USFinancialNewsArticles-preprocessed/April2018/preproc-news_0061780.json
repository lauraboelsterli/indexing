Allergan is clearly focused on strong operational performance and disciplined capital allocation,\" said Brent Saunders, Chairman and CEO of Allergan. \"Allergan revenues grew 3 percent driven by a 13 percent increase in our core business amid exclusivity challenges for older products, and our tight expense management enabled maintenance of strong margins. We drove strong cash flow, continued to pay down debt to further de-lever our balance sheet while accelerating and completing our $2 billion share repurchase program.\"\n\"Our team has continued to drive development of the R&D pipeline and we have achieved several key milestones, including delivering two positive pivotal phase 3 studies for Ubrogepant in acute migraine and the third positive pivotal study for VRAYLAR ® in bipolar depression. This is just the beginning of the clinical data read-outs and pipeline accomplishments we expect to achieve this year. I thank our 17,000 global colleagues for their important work in delivering innovation for patients and I'm extremely proud of their commitment to making Allergan BOLD For Life,\" added Saunders.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Performance\nGAAP operating loss from continuing operations in the first quarter 2018 was $654.0 million, including the impact of amortization and in-process research and development (R&D) impairments. Non-GAAP adjusted operating income from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2018 was $1.76 billion, an increase of 8.7 percent versus the prior year quarter.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal GAAP Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expense was $1.10 billion for the first quarter 2018, compared to $1.19 billion in the prior year quarter. Total non-GAAP SG&A expense decreased to $1.05 billion for the first quarter 2018, compared to $1.11 billion in the prior year period, driven in large part by a reduction in selling and marketing spending, including the impact of previous restructurings. GAAP R&D investment for the first quarter of 2018 was $474.7 million, compared to $759.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2017 was impacted by R&D milestone and acquisition charges of $291.1 million versus $113.4 million in the first quarter of 2018. Non-GAAP R&D investment for the first quarter 2018 was $355.8 million, a decrease of 9.7 percent over the prior year quarter, due to reprioritization of R&D programs.\nAsset Sales & Impairments, Net and In-Process R&D Impairments\nThe Company recorded impairment charges of $535.1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018, primarily due to an impairment of the Company's RORyT IP-R&D project for its Psoriasis indication. The Company excludes asset sales and impairments, net and in-process research and development impairments from its Non-GAAP performance net income attributable to shareholders as well as Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Operating Income.\nAmortization, Other Income (Expense) Net, Tax and Capitalization\nAmortization expense from continuing operations for the first quarter 2018 was $1.70 billion, compared to $1.74 billion in the first quarter of 2017. The Company's GAAP continuing operations tax rate was 70.6 percent in the first quarter of 2018. The Company's non-GAAP adjusted continuing operations tax rate was 14.1 percent in the first quarter 2018. As of March 31, 2018, Allergan had cash and marketable securities of $2.0 billion and outstanding indebtedness of $26.6 billion.\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\nU.S. Specialized Therapeutics\nU.S. Specialized Therapeutics net revenues grew 6.5 percent in the first quarter of 2018 from the prior year quarter to $1.58 billion, driven primarily by the addition of ALLODERM ® and CoolSculpting ® , as well as growth in BOTOX ® , offset in part by decreased revenues in Medical Dermatology. Segment gross margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 91.5 percent, also impacted by CoolSculpting ® and a full quarter of Regenerative Medicine.

Segment gross margin for the first quarter of 2018 decreased to 85.1 percent.

Key development highlights included:\nRegulatory Milestones & Clinical Updates\nAllergan announced positive top line results in the second of two pivotal phase 3 clinical trials evaluating Ubrogepant - an oral CGRP receptor antagonist for the acute treatment of migraine. The results from the ACHIEVE I (UBR-MD-01) and ACHIEVE II (UBR-MD-02) studies support the efficacy, safety and tolerability profile of Ubrogepant. Allergan anticipates filing of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2019. Allergan plc and Gedeon Richter plc announced positive topline results from the third of three pivotal trials of Cariprazine in bipolar I depression. Allergan plans to include data from all three pivotal trials in the Company's Supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA in the second half of 2018. Cariprazine is currently approved in the U.S. under the brand name VRAYLAR ® for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults, and acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults. Allergan was notified by the FDA that the PDUFA target action date of the NDA for ESMYA ® (Ulipristal Acetate) has been extended to August 2018. Allergan and Medicines360 announced that the FDA accepted for filing the companies' sNDA for LILETTA ® (Levonorgestrel-releasing Intrauterine System) 52 mg to potentially extend the duration of use for the prevention of pregnancy from up to four years to up to five years. Allergan announced the launch of OZURDEX ® (Dexamethasone Intravitreal Implant 0.7 mg) in China for the treatment of adult patients with macular edema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO).

We believe that Non-GAAP performance net income per share enhances the comparability of our results between periods and provides additional information and transparency to investors on adjustments and other items that are not indicative of the Company's current and future operating performance. These are the financial measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make day to day operating decisions. We define non-GAAP adjustments to the reported GAAP measures as GAAP results adjusted for the following net of tax: (i) amortization expenses, (ii) global supply chain and operational excellence initiatives or other restructurings of a similar nature, (iii) acquisition, divestiture, integration and licensing charges, (iv) accretion and fair market value adjustments on contingent liabilities, (v) impairment/asset sales and related costs, including the exclusion of discontinued operations, (vi) legal settlements and (vii) other unusual charges or expenses. Non-GAAP performance net income per share is not, and should not be viewed as, a substitute for reported GAAP continuing operations loss per share. The Company has consistently excluded amortization of all intangible assets, including the product rights that generate a significant portion of our ongoing revenue. The Company's total accumulated amortization, including impairments of currently marketed products, related to our intangible assets as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 was $27.5 billion and $25.8 billion, respectively, and is expected to continue to be a material non-GAAP adjustment.
