    "text": "EAST AURORA, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Moog Inc. (NYSE: MOG.A and MOG.B) announced today financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nSecond Quarter Highlights\nSales of $689 million, up 9% from a year ago; Decision to wind down the pitch control portion of the wind energy business in 2018, while continuing to support current customer needs; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $.39 includes restructuring expenses of $0.72 per share related to the wind energy pitch control business and $0.05 per share charge related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; Non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share from operations of $1.16, up from $0.88 a year ago; Announcement of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share, starting in June; Acquisition of VUES Brno s.r.o, a customized motion controls manufacturer in the Czech Republic; Cash flow from operations of $1 million, including $81 million of pension contributions.\nSegment Results\nTotal Aircraft Controls segment sales in the quarter were $311 million, up 8% year over year. Military aircraft sales of $156 million were 14% higher. F-35 Joint Strike Fighter sales increased 12%. Other OEM sales were up 29%, to $76 million, attributed to foreign military sales and helicopter programs. Military aftermarket sales were $47 million, down 3%.\nCommercial aircraft revenues increased 2%, to $156 million. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 39% on strong initial provisioning and spares, offsetting lower OEM sales. Airbus OEM sales were down 10% due to timing of deliveries. Boeing 787 sales were flat while other legacy OEM sales to Boeing were down 17%, mostly due to a decline in 777 volume.\nSpace and Defense segment sales were $144 million, up 3% year over year. Space sales were very strong, 19% higher, attributed to increases in sales of space avionics and launch vehicle controls. Defense sales were down 5%, mostly due to lower demand for military vehicle controls and naval products.\nIndustrial Systems segment sales in the quarter were $234 million, 15% higher from a year ago. Excluding currency effects and acquisitions, sales increased 6%. Industrial automation sales were up a healthy 16%, to $108 million. Energy sales were up 19% on sales of exploration and power generation products. Simulation and test sales were up 12% on strong sales of test equipment. Medical market sales were 10% higher.\nConsolidated 12-month backlog was $1.3 billion.\nFiscal 2018 Outlook\nThe Company updated its projections for fiscal 2018.\nSales of $2.69 billion, up 8% over last year and increased $70 million from 90 days ago; GAAP earnings per share of $2.67, plus or minus $0.20, including the impact of wind energy restructuring and one-time tax reform effects; Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.40, plus or minus $0.20; Adjusted operating margins of 10.9% and GAAP margins of 9.7%; Cash flow from operating activities of $170 million.\n“Our underlying operations had another solid quarter,” said John Scannell, Chairman and CEO. “Six months into the year we’re comfortable with our earnings projections and have increased our sales forecast by $70 million. During the quarter, we announced an acquisition and initiated a quarterly cash dividend. We also decided to wind down our activities in the wind pitch control business by year end, resulting in a charge of $0.72 per share. Over the next six months, we’ll continue to meet the needs of our present wind customers and develop long-term support solutions for their products in the field. As we look out to fiscal ’19, we’ll see a benefit from this decision of 100 basis points in our Industrial Systems margins.”\nIn conjunction with today’s release, Moog will host a conference call beginning at 10:00 a.m. ET, which will be broadcast live over the Internet. John Scannell, Chairman and CEO, and Don Fishback, CFO, will host the call. Listeners can access the call live or in replay mode at www.moog.com/investors/communications .

New factors, risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time that may affect the forward-looking statements made herein. Given these factors, risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as predictive of future results.
