Neptune Stake seeks to create a rebalancing portfolio of staked cryptocurrency assets where investors receive a return on investment proportional to the total cryptocurrency market capitalization.\nCale Moodie, President and CEO states, “In spite of the general crypto market pullback we have been able to significantly cut costs related to Masternode hosting and operations. In addition to our Masternode revenues, we are very excited to provide existing shareholders with substantial upside exposure to a diverse portfolio of cryptocurrency and reinvested income through our proof of stake operations subsidiary.”\nOTC Quotation\nNeptune announces that its common shares are Quote: d on the OTC under trading symbol “NPPTF”.\nDash Masternode\nNeptune builds and operates Dash Masternodes and invests in Dash Blockchain related technologies.

Generally, any statements that are not historical facts may contain forward-looking information, and forward-looking information can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as \"plans\", \"expects\" or \"does not expect\", \"is expected\", \"budget\", \"scheduled\", \"estimates\", \"forecasts\", \"intends\", \"anticipates\" or \"does not anticipate\", or \"believes\", or variations of such words and phrases or indicates that certain actions, events or results \"may\", \"could\", \"would\", \"might\" or \"will be\" taken, \"occur\" or \"be achieved\". Forward-looking information includes, but is not limited to the viability of proof-of-stake mining, commencing the mining of Ethereum, EOS and Cardano, that Ethereum, EOS and Cardano will proceed with protocol implementations that include proof-of-stake mining; the Company's projected asset allocations; business strategy and investment criteria; corporate governance standards applicable to cryptocurrencies; the rate of cryptocurrency adoption and the resultant effect on the growth of the global cryptocurrency market capitalization. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in such forward-looking information include, but are not limited to, the construction and operation of proof-of-stake mining may not occur as currently planned, or at all; the digital currency market; the Company's ability to successfully operate Neptune Dash and Neptune Stake and securely custody digital asset coins; revenue of the Company may not increase as currently anticipated, or at all; the Company may not be able to profitably liquidate its current digital currency inventory, or at all; a decline in digital currency prices may have a significant negative impact on the Company's operations; the volatility of digital currency prices; and other related risks as more fully set out in the Listing Application of the Company dated January 15, 2018.\nThe forward-looking information in this news release reflects the current expectations, assumptions and/or beliefs of the Company based on information currently available to the Company. In connection with the forward-looking information contained in this news release, the Company has made assumptions about the Company's ability to complete the construction and operation of mining operations; the Company will be able to profitably liquidate its digital currency inventory if required; historical prices of digital currencies and the ability of the Company to securely custody the digital assets required to operate each proof-of-stake miner; and there will be no regulation or law that will prevent the Company from operating its business. The Company has also assumed that no significant events occur outside of the Company's normal course of business. Although the Company believes that the assumptions inherent in the forward-looking information are reasonable, forward-looking information is not a guarantee of future performance and accordingly undue reliance should not be put on such information due to the inherent uncertainty therein. Any forward-looking information speaks only as of the date on which it is made and, except as may be required by applicable securities laws, the Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update any forward-looking information, whether as a result of new information, future events or results or otherwise.\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nSource:Neptune Dash Technologies Corp.",
