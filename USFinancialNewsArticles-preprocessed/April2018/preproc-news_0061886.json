    "text": "April 30, 2018 / 8:41 PM / Updated 11 minutes ago Canada seeks to prevent foreign interference in elections Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nOTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada on Monday unveiled measures to prevent foreign interference in elections of the type allegedly seen in the United States, including a clamp down on advertisements and funding. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau participates in a round table with Vancouver business leaders in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada April 30, 2018. REUTERS/Ben Nelms\nThe Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acted amid growing fears that outside actors, using social media and other methods, could seek to influence a vote.\nCanada is due to hold a national election in October 2019.\nUnder the proposals, which must be approved by Parliament, foreign entities would be banned from spending any money to influence elections. Previously they were able to spend up to C$500 ($389) without any regulation.\nOrganizations selling advertising space would not be allowed to knowingly accept elections advertisements from foreign entities, according to an official statement.\nRussia ran an information warfare campaign to disrupt the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Republicans on a congressional panel said in a report released last Friday.\nRussia has repeatedly denied any effort to influence the U.S. election.
