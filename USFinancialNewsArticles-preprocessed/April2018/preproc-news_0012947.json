    "text": "BUDAPEST, April 8 (Reuters) - Voter turnout in Hungaryâ€™s parliamentary election reached 53.64 percent by 1300 GMT on Sunday, a higher interim tally than in 2002, when turnout in the second round of that election was 53.59 percent, National Election Office data showed.\nIn the previous election in 2014, turnout at 1300 GMT was 45.02 percent. Some pollsters said voter turnout above 70 percent could signal efficient mobilisation by the opposition, which may cause Fidesz to lose its parliamentary majority .\nPolls close at 1700 GMT.
