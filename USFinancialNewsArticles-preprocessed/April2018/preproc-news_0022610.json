REUTERS/Daniel Becerril Total said it was buying a 20 percent stake in the North Platte asset. Following this move, Total will have a 60 percent overall stake in North Platte, with Statoil holding the remaining 40 percent.\nTotal also bought a further 20 percent stake in the Anchor discovery, increasing its overall holding in that asset - which is operated by Chevron - to 32.5 percent.\nThe French group also said it was buying 13 offshore exploration blocks in the Gulf of Mexico region.\nReporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ",
