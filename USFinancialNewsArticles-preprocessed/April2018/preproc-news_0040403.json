    "text": "ARCHBOLD, Ohio, April 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Farmers & Merchants Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq:FMAO) today reported financial results for the 2018 first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n2018 First Quarter Financial Highlights Include (on a year-over-year basis unless noted):\n60 consecutive quarters of profitability Total loans increased 8.2% to $834,737,000, and were up 1.4% from the fourth quarter Net interest income after provision for loan losses increased 13.7% to $9,633,000 Net income increased 32.7% to $3,767,000 Earnings per basic and diluted share increased 32.3% to $0.41 Return on average assets was 1.35%, up from 1.07% Return on average equity was 11.20%, up from 8.97%\nPaul S. Siebenmorgen, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “I am pleased with the strong start to the new year as we continue to execute our growth-oriented business plan. From 2007 to March 31, 2018, F&M has expanded its footprint by opening 11 new locations. Total loans at these branches have grown from 7% of our loan portfolio to nearly 49% of our loan portfolio at March 31, 2018. The success of F&M’s de novo growth strategy provides us with growing confidence in our real estate strategy and belief that there are many compelling markets around our core geographies that need the community oriented financial services F&M provides. Most recently we opened our 25 th full-service office in Findlay, Ohio. This full-service office will offer the latest banking technology to serve customers, enabling F&M to offer the benefits of both self-service video banking and the branch experience in one solution. I am pleased with the continued strength of our business, and expect 2018 to be another good year for F&M.”\nIncome Statement\nNet income for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $3,767,000, or $0.41 per basic and diluted share, compared to the same period last year’s net income of $2,839,000, or $0.31 per basic and diluted share, which was adjusted for a two-for-one stock split paid in September 2017. The 32.7% improvement in net income for the 2018 first quarter was primarily due to a 13.7% increase in net interest income after provision for loan losses, partially offset by an 8.0% increase in noninterest expense. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Job Act, the Bank’s tax rate was lowered which benefitted earnings.\nLoan Portfolio and Asset Quality\nTotal loans at March 31, 2018, increased 8.2% to a record $834,737,000, compared to $771,206,000 at March 31, 2017, and up 1.4% from $823,024,000 at December 31, 2017. The year-over-year improvement resulted primarily from an 8.5% increase in commercial real estate loans, a 7.0% increase in commercial and industrial loans, a 14.8% increase in agricultural loans, a 14.0% increase in consumer loans, and a 7.6% increase in agricultural real estate loans.\nThe company’s provision for loan losses for the 2018 first quarter was $40,000, compared to $73,000 for the 2017 first quarter.\nF&M’s loan quality remains strong as the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was 755.2% at March 31, 2018, compared to 479.0% at March 31, 2017. Net charge-offs for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, were $108,000, or 0.01% of average loans, compared to $7,000 or 0.00% of average loans for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nStockholders’ Equity and Dividends\nTangible stockholders’ equity increased to $130,668,000 at March 31, 2018, compared to $129,667,000 at December 31, 2017, and $122,984,000 at March 31, 2017. On a per share basis, tangible stockholders’ equity at March 31, 2018, was $14.06, compared to $13.99 at December 31, 2017, and $13.31, at March 31, 2017. The increase in tangible stockholders’ equity is the result of growth in retained earnings due to increased profitability. At March 31, 2018, the company had a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.11%, compared to 11.81% at March 31, 2017.\nFor the 2018 first quarter, the company declared cash dividends of $0.13 per share, which represents a dividend payout ratio of 31.7% compared to 37.1% for the same period last year.\nMr. Siebenmorgen concluded, “Economic trends remain stable within our local communities. Loan demand was strong for the 2018 first quarter, compared to the same period last year, as total loans increased 8.2%, while non-performing assets declined 29.6%. The year-over-year growth in loans was a result of strong demand across all our loan segments. Net charge-offs for the quarter were very low at 0.01%, compared to last year when they were 0.00%. Total interest income was up 14.6% during the 2018 first quarter, driven by loan growth and higher yield on earnings assets. Overall, we are pleased with the direction we are headed, and optimistic favorable financial and business trends will continue in 2018, as we focus on proactively managing risk with asset growth, expanding market share in our Fort Wayne and Toledo markets, and executing our de-novo and acquisition growth strategies.”\nAbout Farmers & Merchants State Bank:\nThe Farmers & Merchants State Bank is a local independent community bank that has been serving Northwest Ohio and Northeast Indiana since 1897.
