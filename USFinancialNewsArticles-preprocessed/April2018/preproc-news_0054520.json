She was a Principal in the Airline practice at Bain & Company and has held senior executive positions at Hawaiian Airlines and Booking.com .\n“I’m thrilled to welcome Vicki to Stellar’s management team,” said Stellar CEO David Fox. “Her experience managing partnerships in both the digital and airline sectors will be critical as Stellar enhances its relationship with Rockwell Collins and strikes new deals with strategic partners.”\nStellar, in partnership with Rockwell Collins, is developing a next-generation, cloud-based operating platform that will combine the market-leading flight operations planning functionality of ARINCDirect SM Flight Operations System (“FOS”) with Stellar’s global distribution systems and commercial operations technology.\nIn February 2018, the company launched the Stellar Cloud as the preferred infrastructure environment for FOS and the foundation of the future jointly developed unified platform.\n“Vicki joins the team at a critical inflection point for Stellar’s business,” said Stellar Chairman Dean Donovan. “The company is transitioning from primarily product development to managing growth. Vicki has the experience to help our partners and customers seamlessly transition into the Stellar Cloud and onto the next generation of FOS software. We are also very excited to bring an accomplished female executive onto the team and build on our commitment to making women successful at Stellar.”\n“I’m extremely excited to join the Stellar team as we prepare to launch an industry-changing business aviation platform,” said Vicki Nakata. “As the last major travel industry to ‘go digital,’ the opportunities to eliminate inefficiencies and create real value for both operators and travelers are massive.”\nAn avid traveler and airplane enthusiast, Vicki received her MBA from Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management and her BA in economics from Amherst College.\nABOUT STELLAR LABS\nStellar Labs builds and delivers innovative flight operations management, commercial management, and global distribution systems for business aviation.
