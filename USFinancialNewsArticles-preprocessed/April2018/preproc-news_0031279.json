    "text": "BOULDER, Colo.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Clovis Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ:CLVS) announced today the upsizing and pricing of an underwritten public offering of $300 million aggregate principal amount of its 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2025 at a price to the public of 100% of the principal amount of the notes, before underwriting discounts and commissions. Clovis also granted to the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $45 million aggregate principal amount of the notes on the same terms and conditions. The notes will bear interest at a rate of 1.25% per annum, payable semi-annually on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The notes will mature on May 1, 2025 unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The holders of the notes may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date at an initial conversion rate of 13.1278 shares of Clovis Oncology’s common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which is equivalent to the initial conversion price of approximately $76.17 per share of common stock.\nClovis also announced today the pricing of 1,837,898 shares of its common stock in an underwritten public offering at a price to the public of $54.41 per share for gross proceeds of approximately $100 million, before underwriting discounts and commissions.
