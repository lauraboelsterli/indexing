    "text": "April 28, 2018 / 3:58 PM / Updated 8 minutes ago Zimbabwe says will issue cannabis licences to growers Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nHARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabweans can now apply for licences to grow cannabis for medical and research purposes, the government has said in a legal notice, making the southern African nation the second country in Africa to legalise cultivation of the plant. FILE PHOTO: Droplets of oil form on the surface of a Cannabis plant in a state-owned agricultural farm in Rovigo, about 60 km (40 miles) from Venice, September 22, 2014. REUTERS/Alessandro Bianchi/File Photo\nLesotho last year announced the continent’s first licence to grow cannabis legally.\nUntil now, it has been illegal to grow, possess or use cannabis in Zimbabwe, with offenders facing up to 12 years in jail.\nHealth Minister David Parirenyatwa published new regulations, seen by Reuters on Saturday, allowing individuals and companies to be licenced to cultivate marijuana, known locally as mbanje.\nThe five-year renewable licences will allow growers to possess, transport and sell fresh and dried cannabis as well as cannabis oil.\nApplications should include plans of the growing site, quantity to be produced and sold and the production period.\nA licence can be refused when information has been received from a “peace officer, a competent authority or the United Nations” that an applicant was involved in the diversion of a controlled substance or precursor to an illicit market or use”, the regulations said.\n“The Minister may not oblige if the issuance, renewal or amendment of the licence is likely to create a risk to public health, safety or security.” Reporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe; Editing by Andrew Bolton",
