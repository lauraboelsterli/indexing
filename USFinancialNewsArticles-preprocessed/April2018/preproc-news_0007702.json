    "text": "April 8, 2018 / 5:41 PM / Updated 17 minutes ago Hernandez earns West Ham a valuable point at Chelsea Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nLONDON, April 8 (Reuters)- - CHELSEA 1 WEST HAM UNITED 1 Soccer Football - Premier League - Chelsea vs West Ham United - Stamford Bridge, London, Britain - April 8, 2018 West Ham United's Javier Hernandez and Patrice Evra celebrate after the match Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Couldridge \nSubstitute Javier Hernandez stole an equaliser to earn West Ham United an unlikely point in a 1-1 draw with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. \nThe home side had dominated the London derby for 73 minutes, leading for almost half that time after Cesar Azpilicueta poked home in following a short corner. \nTheir Spanish striker Alvaro Morata also had the ball in the net twice but was narrowly offside each time. \nWest Ham, who had been much improved in beating Southampton 3-0 a week ago, offered little until Hernandez’s intervention soon after coming on. Related Coverage \nChelsea midfielders Willian and Eden Hazard were the game’s most creative forces and were both involved in the few scoring opportunities before their team finally struck. \nHazard linked up cleverly with Willian, the Brazilian bringing a good save from Joe Hart. \nFrom the subsequent corner, however, West Ham switched off and allowed Azpilicueta two bites before he jabbed the ball in. Soccer Football - Premier League - Chelsea vs West Ham United - Stamford Bridge, London, Britain - April 8, 2018 West Ham United's Javier Hernandez scores their first goal Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Couldridge \nWillian squandered a good chance early in the second half, shooting wide of the far post, and Chelsea were made to pay when Marko Arnautovic set up Hernandez to score only a few minutes after the Mexican striker had come on. \nHart, keen to restore his reputation as England’s best goalkeeper before the World Cup finals, made fine saves from Marcos Alonso and substitute Olivier Giroud late in the game. \n“We did well in the first half apart from the goal which was really poor,” Hart told Sky Sports. \n“They are the champions, let’s not forget. They created a lot but we stood strong.” \nWith six games left, the draw left West Ham in 14th place, only six points short of the target of 40 for survival that their manager David Moyes has set them. \nChelsea’s prospects of catching fourth-placed Tottenham, who are 10 points ahead of them, now look even more remote. \nThere was an emotional tribute before the game, and after eight minutes of play, to Ray Wilkins, the former Chelsea captain and assistant manager, who died in midweek.
