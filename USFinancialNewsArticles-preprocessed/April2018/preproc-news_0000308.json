Australian shares were off 0.3 percent.\nThe losses in tech shares came after U.S. President Donald Trump attacked Amazon.com over the pricing of its deliveries through the United States Postal Service and promised unspecified changes.\nInvestors were also on the backfoot as China imposed extra tariffs on 128 U.S. products, deepening a dispute between the world’s two biggest economies and stoking concerns about the impact on global growth.\nFears of a full blown trade war became a clear focus in a U.S. manufacturing activity report for March which showed new orders index at its lowest since August.\n“The China tariffs didn’t seem too bad but combined with editorials in the state press they do suggest China is ready to escalate if negotiations fail,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at AxiTrader.\n“And of course, the U.S. President’s tweets about Amazon just added fuel to the fire started by a recognition maybe the ‘FANGS’, and thus the overall market, had got ahead of themselves.”\nSo called FANG stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google - have been largely responsible for a multi-year bull run in world shares, although the threat of government regulation has raised worries about their outlook.\nFacebook, Apple and some of their peers had a woeful last quarter as investors reassessed the high U.S. stock valuations in light of the cocktail of negative factors.\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq declined 2.4 percent on Monday, wiping out all of its gains this year while the S&P 500 crashed through its 200-day moving average, a closely watched technical indicator.\nChina’s tit-for-tat tariffs also hurt the U.S. dollar which fell for a fourth straight day against the Japanese yen.\nThe dollar index was stable around recent ranges against a basket of currencies.\nU.S. Treasury prices rose, with yields on benchmark 10-year notes near the lowest since early February.\nOil prices were left licking their wounds after falling more than 3.7 percent on Monday weighed by higher Russian output, the escalating U.S.-China trade dispute and expectations Saudi Arabia will cut prices of crude.\nBrent crude inched 14 cents higher to $ 67.78 a barrel. U.S. crude rose 13 cents to $63.14.\nGold, which is often seen as a store of value during times of financial or political uncertainty, rose.\nSpot gold ticked up to $1,341.38.\nEditing by Shri Navaratnam\n ",
