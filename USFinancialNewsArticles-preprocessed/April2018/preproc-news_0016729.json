    "text": "Published: Apr 9, 2018 5:54 p.m. ET Share \nApple exec says aim is to turn supply chain green as well AFP/Getty Images Apple's new headquarters building in Cupertino, Calif., is one of the largest on-site solar installations in the world. \nBy Tripp Mickle Timothy Puko \nApple Inc. said on Monday that it has achieved a decade-old goal of having its facilities worldwide powered exclusively by renewable energy, an achievement that will shift the company’s sustainability efforts to its supply chain, where about 10% of suppliers have made a similar commitment. \nThe tech giant said it has improved to be 100% reliant on clean energy from 96% last year in part by contracting renewable energy for the first time in India, Turkey, Brazil and Mexico. The figure covers all of its retail stores, offices, data centers and partner data centers, as well as Apple Park, its new spaceshiplike headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., that features rooftop solar panels and is one of the largest on-site solar installations in the world. \nApple US:AAPL is just one of many global corporations trying to cut energy consumption and shift to renewable power including wind and solar, both to cut costs and slow climate change. More than 100 companies worldwide, including Apple, IKEA, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA US:BUD and Starbucks Corp. US:SBUX , pledged in 2014 to shift to 100% renewable energy. By the end of 2016, 25 had already met the pledge, according to the collaborative, named RE100. \nMany of the RE100 companies are now trying to accelerate efforts to convince their suppliers to join them. While becoming 100% dependent on clean energy at its facilities is an achievement, environmental experts said the bigger challenge will be making the manufacturers of the more than 200 million iPhones and 43 million iPads it sells annually wholly dependent on renewable energy. “We’re not going to stop until our supply chain is 100% renewable,” said Apple Vice President of Environment Lisa Jackson in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.",
