Chicago Board of Trade May wheat rose 0.7 percent to $4.65-1/2 a bushel at 1122 GMT. May soybeans increased 0.2 percent to $10.44-3/4 a bushel and May corn rose 0.3 percent to $3.84 a bushel. Wheat saw a large drop on Monday on forecasts for much-needed rain in the U.S. Plains which took a fair level of risk out of the market, Clack said. This could be viewed as presenting a good buying opportunity today with some regarding the market as oversold. Although U.S. crop conditions are showing an improvement, there is still a long time to go in the season and the risk to the U.S. crop is far from over yet. The winter in the U.S. was dry so there remains the question whether crop abandonment will creep up. The USDA said late on Monday that 31 percent of the U.S. wheat crop is in good to excellent condition, up from 30 percent last week and surpassing market expectations of 30 percent. Corn was following wheat on Monday and is also seeing some influence from wheat today, Clack said. There is also some worry about the slow start to U.S. corn sowings which is supportive, with 3 percent planted against 6 percent this time last year. \"U.S. farmers are starting to get behind with corn plantings and weather forecasts are not favorable for sowings. The U.S. planting delays are not a huge concern but it is a factor which could start to play on peoples minds. Soybeans were supported by renewed signs of trade friction as China announced new measures aimed at imports of the feed grain sorghum from the U.S. \nU.S. oilseed processors crushed a record volume of soybeans in March, the U.S. National Oilseed Processors Association (NOPA) said on Monday. There is again focus in the soybean market on bullish factors after falls on Monday,\" Clack said. \"The U.S./China trade war is again in view, Argentinas crop is poor and high U.S. crushing figures underline strong demand. \nGrains prices at 1122 GMT \nContract Last Change Pct chg Two-day chg MA 30 RSI CBOT wheat 465.50 3.25 +0.70% -1.48% 470.87 43 CBOT corn 383.75 1.25 +0.33% -0.65% 384.34 45 CBOT soy 1044.50 2.50 +0.24% -0.92% 1040.06 51 CBOT rice $13.00 -$0.06 -0.46% -0.88% $12.51 71 WTI crude $66.25 $0.03 +0.05% -1.69% $63.72 60 \nCurrencies \nMost active contracts Wheat, corn and soy US cents/bushel.
