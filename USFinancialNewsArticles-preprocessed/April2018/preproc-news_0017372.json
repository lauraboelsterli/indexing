    "text": "IBEX 35 --- \nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 closed 2.4 percent higher provisionally with every sector rising. Basic resources and technology stocks were the top-performing sectors, each up over 3 percent. \nOverall, market sentiment was driven by news that the U.S. is willing to sit down with the Chinese authorities and fix their trade divergences. China presented Wednesday a list of retaliatory measures against recent proposals for U.S. tariffs on a range of Chinese products. \nLooking across the European benchmark, Ubisoft topped the gains, up by 10.77 percent. The success of its latest video game \"Far Cry 5\" led to a ratings upgrade and drove the shares higher. Meanwhile, the health care firm BTG dropped more than 10 percent after taking an impairment charge of around 150 million pounds ($211 million), Reuters reported. ",
