    "text": "LOS ANGELES, April 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Social Reality, Inc. (Nasdaq: SRAX), a digital marketing and consumer data management and distribution technology platform company, reported GAAP net income of $178,000, $0.02 per share, and Adjusted EBITDA gain of $1.2 million for the fourth quarter 2017.\nSRAX's CEO and Chairman Christopher Miglino, stated, \"Our focus on high margin revenue for the past year culminated in a very strong fourth quarter with a positive bottom line and substantial annual improvements. In 2017, gross margin reached 60%, increasing from 35%, and Adjusted EBITDA improved over $750,000, both when compared to 2016. To broaden our growth opportunities, we also invested in sales talent, including in our consumer-packaged goods vertical, and engineering resources in the past year. Now, we are well positioned to leverage our successful healthcare vertical, both as a model to grow other verticals and as an asset to be monetized. In fact, we are now in the final phase of this process. While we cannot discuss more until a definitive agreement has been signed, we are happy with our progress.\"\n\"Additionally, we are excited to be in the next development phase of our consumer data management and distribution system with the Alpha release of our BIG platform. This is particularly relevant since consumers are increasingly realizing the true value of their data as they see large companies monetarily benefiting from their information. We believe our BIG platform will markedly expand the digital data ecosystem by providing consumers the ability to own, verify and sell access to their data, and by improving the quality of enriched data available to advertisers and marketing companies. Overall, we believe 2018 will be a year of strategic change and growth for our verticals and BIG platform.\"\nFinancial Results: Fourth Quarter 2017 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2016\nGross revenue was $6.5 million, compared to $11.5 million of 2016, which included revenue from a large, non-recurring SRAX Reach customer that was partially offset by an increase in revenue from SRAX buy-side and sell-side clients as well as continuing growth in SRAXmd. Gross profit was $5.5 million, increasing from $4.7 million of 2016. Gross margin was 85%, compared 41% of 2016, reflecting the focus on high-margin revenue and the impact of several one-time year-end adjustments. Operating expenses were $5.6 million, compared to $5.6 million in fourth quarter of 2016. The 2017 cost levels reflect first quarter cost management measures offset by product development costs related to the BIG platform. Loss from operations decreased to $67,000, up from $849,000 the fourth quarter of 2016. Other income improved to $244,000, compared to other expense of $494,000 of 2016. Net income improved to $178,000, or $0.02 per share, compared a net loss of $1.3 million, or $0.22 per share of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA gain improved to $1.2 million, compared to a gain of $581, 000 of 2016. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.0 million at December 31, 2017, compared to $216,000 at September 30, 2017 and $1.0 million at December 31, 2016. Working capital at December 31, 2017 was positive $1.1 million, improved from negative $8.3 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and certain additional one-time expenses. It is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). A detailed description and reconciliation of EBITDA and management's reasons for using this measure is set forth at the end of this press release.\n2017 Financial Results:\nGross revenue was $23.3 million, compared to $35.8 million in 2016. Gross profit increased to $14.3 million, from $12.5 million in 2016. Gross margin was 60%, up from 35% in 2016. Loss from operations decreased to $3.8 million, up from $4.8 million in 2016. Net loss was $6.7 million, or $0.81 per share. 2016 net loss including a $3.7 million benefit from a contingent consideration write-off was $4.2 million, or $0.69 per share. Adjusted EBITDA loss improved to $382,000, up from and Adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.1 million in 2016.\nOther Recent Corporate Highlights:\nReleased the Alpha version of the BIG platform consumer data management and distribution system to a limited, by invitation only group of users. Made significant progress toward the monetization of SRAXmd, including starting an auction process that management believes has entered its final stage. Expended SRAX human capital to support the development of the BIG platform and expand the sales force, particular for the consumer-packaged goods vertical.\nAs the company is evaluating strategic alternatives for SRAXmd, management has elected not to provide financial guidance at this time.\nConference Call\nManagement will review the results on a conference call with a live question and answer session today, April 2, 2018, at 1:30 p.m. ET.

In addition to the company's GAAP results, management also considers the non-GAAP measure of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as income from operations before depreciation and amortization expenses, stock-based compensation and one-time financing and transaction expense. Management believes that this non-GAAP measure provides useful information about Social Reality's operating results. The tables below provide a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP measure should be considered a supplement to, and not a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThree Months ended December 31,\nTwelve Months ended December 31,\n2017\n2016\n2017\n2016\nNet loss\n$16,507,703\n$12,392,394\n$16,507,703\n$12,392,394\nPlus:\nEquity Based compensation\n1,138,021\n1,319,817\n2,085,988\n2,303,843\nAccretion of put warrants\n1,934,663\n-\n-\n-\nAccretion of debenture discount and warrants\n(788,873)\n-\n-\n-\nAccretion of Leapfrog warrants\n(336,348)\n-\n-\n-\nAccretion of put liability\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAccretion of contingent consideration\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAdjusted net loss\n2,125,538\n(24,117)\n(4,572,894)\n(1,944,390)\nLoss on repurchase of Series B warrants\n(2,053,975)\n-\n-\n-\nLoss on repricing of Series A warrants\n(99,820)\n-\n-\n274,695\nDerivative liabilities for convertible debentures and warrants\n-\n-\n-\nRestructuring Costs\n-\n-\n377,961\n-\nWrite-off of non-compete agreement\n-\n-\n468,750\n-\nExchange Gain or Loss\n10,622\n-\n10,622\n-\nGain on settlement\n(45,125)\n-\n(45,125)\n-\nWrite-off of contingent consideration\n-\n-\n-\n(3,744,496)\nImpairment of goodwill\n-\n-\n-\n670,000\nInterest Expense\n1,134,064\n504,891\n2,849,706\n3,220,489\nDepreciation and amortization\n155,682\n100,090\n528,622\n387,034\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$ 1,226,986\n$ 580,864\n$ (382,358)\n$ (1,136,668)\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/srax-reports-positive-net-income-and-positive-adjusted-ebitda-for-the-fourth-quarter-of-2017-300622796.html\nSOURCE Social Reality, Inc.",
