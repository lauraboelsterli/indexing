    "text": "MUSCATINE, Iowa--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Iowa First Bancshares Corp. (OTC Pink: IOFB) today reported operating results for the three month period ended March 31, 2018. Consolidated net income totaled $733,000 compared to net income of $393,000 for the same period last year, an increase of $340,000 or 86.5%. Comparing first quarter 2018 and first quarter 2017 results: net interest income decreased $29,000 or 0.8%; provision for loan losses decreased $540,000 or 50.0%; noninterest income declined by $22,000 or 2.6%; noninterest expense increased $119,000 or 4.0%; and income tax expense increased $30,000 or 16.0%.\nBasic and diluted earnings per share were $.65 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $.30 from the same period in 2017. The Company’s annualized return on average assets for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 was .62% and .33%, respectively. The Company’s annualized return on average equity for the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 was 6.4% and 3.5%, respectively.\nTotal assets at March 31, 2018 were nearly $477.7 million, an increase of approximately $7.7 million (1.6%) from March 31, 2017. Deposits totaled $407.6 million, an increase of approximately $9.0 million (2.3%) when comparing the end of the first quarter of 2018 to 2017. Gross loans outstanding at March 31, 2018, decreased $7.6 million (1.9%), compared to March 31, 2017.\nThe allowance for loan losses totaled $5.75 million at March 31, 2018, or 1.44% of gross loans outstanding compared to 1.13% of gross loans at March 31, 2017. Net loans charged-off during the first quarter of 2018 and 2017 totaled $478,000 and $1,160,000, respectively. The vast majority of first quarter 2018 net charge-offs have been in the agriculture loan portfolio. Nonaccrual loans totaled $7.6 million or 1.9% of gross outstanding loans at March 31, 2018, a substantial increase from $2.4 million or .6% of gross outstanding loans at March 31, 2017. This disappointing increase in nonaccrual loans has occurred primarily at the Fairfield subsidiary bank and partially accounts for the decline in consolidated net interest margin from 3.47% for the year ended December 31, 2017 to 3.40% during the first quarter of 2018. At March 31, 2018, approximately 48% of nonaccrual loans are in the agriculture loan portfolio and approximately 30% are in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio. The remaining nonaccrual loans are in commercial and residential real estate and consumer loans. Management is focused on improving the quality of the overall loan portfolio and reducing the amount of nonaccrual loans. Realistically, however, it will likely take several quarters of hard work to reduce this nonaccrual loan total to a more acceptable level.\nOver the past year, the Fairfield subsidiary bank has had its President and CEO retire and two senior lending officers resign to pursue other career opportunities. Fortunately, a very experienced President and CEO and a new, experienced Chief Credit Officer have joined our management team. Together these very talented bankers have been focusing on enhancing the bank’s policies, procedures, training and overall lending culture.\nTo provide these leaders the opportunity to succeed in their efforts to restore the Fairfield bank to a position as a significant contributor to shareholder value, Iowa First completed during the first quarter of 2018 a capital (cash) injection of $2.0 million into the Fairfield bank. This capital injection was funded by cash on hand combined with $1.4 million of borrowed funds. As a result of this capital injection, the bank’s tier 1 capital to average assets ratio increased from 7.8% on December 31, 2017 to 9.1% at March 31, 2018, and its total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio increased from 11.0% to 12.5%.\nThe board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.29 per share payable April 24, 2018, to shareholders of record April 2, 2018. On an annualized basis this dividend represents a return of 2.6% on the December 31, 2017 stock price. Iowa First Bancshares Corp. has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1989.\nAt the annual shareholders meeting held April 19, 2018, the shareholders voted in favor of the election of all four director nominees. The shareholders also voted in favor of each of the other proposals which had been recommended by the Company.\nIowa First Bancshares Corp. is a bank holding company headquartered in Muscatine, Iowa. The Company provides a wide array of banking and other financial services to individuals, businesses and governmental organizations through its two wholly-owned national banks located in Muscatine and Fairfield, Iowa.\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements.
