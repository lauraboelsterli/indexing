    "text": "(Repeats to attach to alerts)\nBEIJING, April 13 (Reuters) - China’s total social financing (TSF), a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, rose to 1.33 trillion yuan ($211.63 billion) in March from 1.17 trillion yuan in February, data from the central bank showed on Friday.\nTSF includes off-balance sheet forms of financing that exist outside the conventional bank lending system, such as initial public offerings, loans from trust companies and bond sales.\nThe TSF economic barometer has become a gauge of fundraising trends and can provide hints of activity in China’s vast and unregulated shadow banking sector.\nChinese authorities have been trying to clamp down on riskier forms of lending as part of a broader campaign to contain and reduce systemic financial risks.
