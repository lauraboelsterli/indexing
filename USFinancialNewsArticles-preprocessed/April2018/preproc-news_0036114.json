    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Atlas Cloud Enterprises Inc. (CSE:AKE) (XFRA:A49) (OTCPINK:ATLEF) (the “Company” or “Atlas Cloud”), an experienced IT service provider focused on becoming the lowest cost producer in the blockchain and digital currency mining sector, is pleased to announce the appointment of Mr. Charlie Kiser to the position of Chief Executive Officer effective immediately.\nMr. Kiser is a cryptocurrency and technology veteran. Along with his 20 years of technology experience, Charlie recognized and advocated for the disruptive potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain in 2014 when he helped take the first pure-play bitcoin and blockchain company public in North America. As the earliest public crypto company, they leveraged both an operational and holding company strategy, investing in 4 crypto start-ups; GoCoin, covering payment processing; Coin Outlet, a bitcoin ATM and distribution network; Gem, a multi factor authentication wallet, and Expresscoin, a retail cryptocurrency outlet. The company built out one of the largest eCommerce platforms that accepted digital currencies, and ultimately moved into the emerging industrial cryptocurrency mining space.\nDuring his tenure at the company, Charlie developed a marketing strategy for eCommerce and Digital Currency products, as well as a framework to help acquire cryptocurrency mining equipment through a grassroots acquisition program. He supported two additional rounds of capital investment and led the marketing strategy for the initial launch of a dedicated cryptocurrency mining facility.\nIn his advocacy role at the first public blockchain company, Charlie became deeply embedded in the early crypto community, and helped form an Advisory Board consisting of notable crypto industry veterans. This experience gave Charlie a unique awareness of the regulatory environment for public companies, and he was one of the leading advocates in the first ever Bitcoin Awareness Day on Capitol Hill in Washington DC. During a period as CEO of Griot Inc, he helped build a FinTech accounting and financial platform poised to assist federal contractors and agencies investigate procurement and audit of federal contracts on the blockchain. Charlie is an Advisor to several crypto and technology start-ups including Loci and Build1X and obtained his degree in Finance from West Virginia University.\nIn related news, Fred Stearman moves to the role of Chief Operating Officer, and the Company thanks him for his service as CEO since inception. As a veteran of IT infrastructure, Mr. Stearman’s operational experience is invaluable in the identification and buildout of cryptocurrency mining data centres. Mr. Stearman notes, “I am delighted to welcome Charlie to the team and look forward to working closely with him as we move ahead with our strategic plans for 2018 and beyond. It's an exciting time in our industry, and today’s announcement is further evidence of our commitment towards building a sector-leading concept and company aimed at increasing shareholder value.”\nThe development of the Company’s business to digital currency mining has been deemed a fundamental change under the policies of the Canadian Securities Exchange. As a result, the Company’s expansion of its business remains subject to the approval of the Company shareholders and the Exchange.\nAbout Atlas Cloud Enterprises Inc.
