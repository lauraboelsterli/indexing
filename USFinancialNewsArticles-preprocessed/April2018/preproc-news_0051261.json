GLOBAL TOP NEWS • Shire says willing to recommend Takeda's $64 bln offer to shareholder London-listed drugmaker Shire said it was willing to recommend a deal with Takeda Pharmaceutical to its shareholders, after the Japanese company sweetened its acquisition offer to $64 billion. • Trump and France's Macron seek new measures on Iran as deadline looms U.S. President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron pledged on Tuesday to seek stronger measures to contain Iran,but Trump refrained from committing to staying in a 2015 nuclear deal and threatened Tehran with retaliation if it restarted its nuclear program. • South Korea's LG Display looks up after posting first loss in 6 yrs South Korea's LG Display forecast higher panel shipments and more stable prices in the second quarter as it reported its first operating loss in six years on Wednesday, hit by a flood of supply from Chinese rivals. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • The SGX Nifty nearest-month futures were trading at 10,555.50, down 0.6 percent from its previous close. • The Indian rupee is seen lower against the dollar today as Wall Street’s overnight slide and higher U.S. yields hurt demand for regional assets. • Indian government bonds will likely trade lower in early session as U.S. Treasury prices fall, while higher crude oil prices may continue to weigh on investor sentiment. The yield on the 7.17 percent bond maturing in 2028 is likely to trade in a 7.65 percent - 7.71 percent band today. GLOBAL MARKETS • Wall Street dropped sharply on Tuesday as warnings by bellwether companies of higher costs reverberated as the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield pierced the 3 percent level for the first time in four years. • Asian shares were under pressure, with a rise in U.S. bond yields above the 3 percent threshold and warnings from bellwether U.S. companies of higher costs driving fears that corporate earnings growth may peak soon. • The dollar was steady, just below a four-month high reached after the U.S. 10-year bond yield hit 3 percent for the first time since early 2014, as a slide in Wall Street stocks slowed the pace of the greenback rally. • The U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose to 3 percent for the first time in more than four years on Tuesday, reflecting the durability of the U.S. economic expansion and stoking views the three-decade-old bull market in bonds is coming to an end. • Oil prices fell back from more than three-year highs reached the previous session as rising U.S. fuel inventories and production weighed on an otherwise bullish market. • Gold prices edged higher as most global stock markets fell and as the U.S. dollar eased below an over three-month high hit in the previous session.
