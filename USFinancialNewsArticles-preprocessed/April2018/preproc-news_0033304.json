Earnings growth was driven by our continued strong execution as well as the benefits of tax reform. Our two-point strategy of accelerating growth and driving operational excellence continues to produce results.\"\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nChange\n(dollars in millions, except per share data)\nReported:\nNet revenues (a)\n$\n1,884\n$\n1,817\n3.7\n%\nDiagnostic Information Services revenues (a)\n$\n1,803\n$\n1,730\n4.1\n%\nRevenue per requisition\n1.6\n%\nRequisition volume\n2.2\n%\nOperating income (a) (b)\n$\n272\n$\n279\n(2.5)\n%\nOperating income as a percentage of net revenues (a) (b)\n14.5\n%\n15.4\n%\n(90)\nbps\nNet income attributable to Quest Diagnostics (b)\n$\n177\n$\n164\n8.2\n%\nDiluted EPS (b)\n$\n1.27\n$\n1.16\n9.5\n%\nCash provided by operations\n$\n180\n$\n196\n(8.5)\n%\nCapital expenditures\n$\n73\n$\n42\n75.4\n%\nAdjusted:\nOperating income (a)\n$\n303\n$\n297\n1.9\n%\nOperating income as a percentage of net revenues (a)\n16.1\n%\n16.3\n%\n(20)\nbps\nNet income attributable to Quest Diagnostics\n$\n192\n$\n159\n20.8\n%\nDiluted EPS excluding amortization\n$\n1.52\n$\n1.22\n24.6\n%\n(a) Net revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 have been\nrestated to reflect the impact of new revenue recognition rules that are effective January 1, 2018 and were adopted on\na retrospective basis. Under the new rules, the Company reports uncollectible balances associated with patient\nresponsibility as a reduction in net revenues when historically these amounts were classified as bad debt expense\nwithin selling, general and administrative expenses.\n(b) For further details impacting the year-over-year comparisons related to operating income, operating income as a\npercentage of net revenues, net income attributable to Quest Diagnostics, and diluted EPS, see note 2 of the financial\ntables attached below.\nOutlook for Full Year 2018\nThe company's outlook for full year 2018 remains unchanged as follows:\nCurrent Outlook\nLow\nHigh\nRevenues (a)\n$7.70 billion\n$7.77 billion\nRevenue increase (a)\n4%\n5%\nReported diluted EPS\n$5.42\n$5.62\nAdjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization\n$6.50\n$6.70\nCash provided by operations\nApproximately $1.3 billion\nCapital expenditures\n$350 million\n$400 million\n(a) The outlook for 4% to 5% revenue growth in 2018 represents management's estimates for 2018 versus 2017\nreported revenues adjusted to reflect the impact of new revenue recognition rules that are effective January\n1, 2018. Full year 2017 revenues adjusted to reflect the new rules were $7,402 million. See note 5 of the\nfinancial tables attached below.\nNote on Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAs used in this press release the term \"reported\" refers to measures under the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"). The term \"adjusted\" refers to non-GAAP measures as follows: (i) for the purpose of income measures the term \"adjusted\" refers to operating performance measures that exclude special items such as restructuring and integration charges, excess tax benefit (\"ETB\") associated with stock based compensation and other items; and (ii) the term \"adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization\" represents the company's diluted EPS before the impact of special items (described above) and amortization expense.\nNon-GAAP adjusted measures are presented because management believes those measures are useful adjuncts to GAAP results. Non-GAAP adjusted measures should not be considered as an alternative to the corresponding measures determined under GAAP. Management may use these non-GAAP measures to evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to establish operational budgets and forecasts and for incentive compensation purposes. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors and analysts to evaluate our performance period over period and relative to competitors, as well as to analyze the underlying trends in our business and to assess our performance. The additional tables attached below include reconciliations of adjusted measures to GAAP measures.\nConference Call Information\nQuest Diagnostics will hold its quarterly conference call to discuss financial results beginning at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time today.

For the three months ended March 31, 2017, represents costs\nprimarily associated with systems conversions and integration incurred in connection with further\nrestructuring and integrating our business. The following table summarizes the pre-tax impact of\nrestructuring and integration charges on the company's consolidated statements of operations:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n(dollars in millions)\nCost of services\n$\n12\n$\n10\nSelling, general and administrative\n18\n8\nOther operating expense, net\n1\n—\nOperating income\n$\n31\n$\n18\n(b) For restructuring and integration charges, income tax impacts, where recorded, were calculated using\ncombined tax rates of 25.5% and 38.7% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. The following table\nsummarizes the income tax benefit associated with special items:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n(dollars in millions)\nRestructuring and integration charges\n$\n(8)\n$\n(7)\nETB (d)\n(8)\n(16)\n$\n(16)\n$\n(23)\n(c) Represents the impact of amortization expense on diluted earnings per common share, net of the income tax\nbenefit. The income tax benefit was primarily calculated using combined tax rates of 25.5% and 38.7% for\n2018 and 2017, respectively. The pre-tax amortization expense that is excluded from the calculation of\nadjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense is recorded in the company's statements of operations\nas follows:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n(dollars in millions)\nAmortization of intangible assets\n$\n22\n$\n17\nEquity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes\n4\n4\n$\n26\n$\n21\n(d) Represents the impact of ETB recorded in income tax expense.\n3) For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the company repurchased 0.5 million shares of its common\nstock for $50 million. At March 31, 2018, $0.9 billion remained available under the company's share\nrepurchase authorizations.\n4) The outlook for adjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense represents management's estimates\nfor the full year 2018 before the impact of special items, including ETB, and amortization expense. Further\nimpacts to earnings related to special items may be incurred throughout the remainder of the year.\nAdditionally, the amount of ETB is dependent upon employee stock option exercises and the company's\nstock price, which are difficult to predict. The following table reconciles our 2018 outlook for adjusted diluted\nEPS excluding amortization expense to the corresponding amounts determined under GAAP:\nLow\nHigh\nDiluted earnings per common share\n$\n5.42\n$\n5.62\nRestructuring and integration charges (a)\n0.59\n0.59\nAmortization expense (b)\n0.58\n0.58\nETB (c)\n(0.09)\n(0.09)\nAdjusted diluted EPS excluding amortization expense\n$\n6.50\n$\n6.70\n(a) Represents estimated full year pre-tax charges of $110 million primarily associated with systems conversions,\nintegration and workforce reductions incurred in connection with further restructuring and integrating our\nbusiness. Income tax benefits were calculated using a combined tax rate of 25.5%.\n(b) Represents the estimated impact of amortization expense for 2018 on the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS\nexcluding amortization expense. Amortization expense used in the calculation is as follows (dollars in millions):\nAmortization of intangible assets\n$\n91\nAmortization expense included in equity in earnings of equity method investees, net of taxes\n16\nTotal pre-tax amortization expense\n$\n107\nTotal amortization expense, net of an estimated tax benefit\n$\n80\n(c) Represents the estimated full year impact of ETB.\n5) The outlook for 4% to 5% revenue growth in 2018 represents management's estimates for 2018 versus\n2017 reported revenues adjusted to reflect the impact of new revenue recognition rules that became\neffective January 1, 2018. Under the new rules, the Company will report uncollectible balances\nassociated with patient responsibility as a reduction in net revenues when historically these amounts\nwere classified as bad debt expense within selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe following tables reconcile our 2017 net revenues determined under previous revenue recognition rules with 2017 net revenue adjusted to reflect the impact of the new revenue recognition rules:\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nMarch 31,\n2017\nJune 30,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2017\nDecember 31,\n2017\n(dollars in millions)\n2017 Revenue on an adjusted basis:\nNet revenues\n$\n1,899\n$\n1,943\n$\n1,931\n$\n1,936\n$\n7,709\nAdjustment for adoption of new revenue\nrecognition rules\n(82)\n(79)\n(75)\n(71)\n(307)\n2017 Revenue on an adjusted basis\n$\n1,817\n$\n1,864\n$\n1,856\n$\n1,865\n$\n7,402\n2018 Revenue outlook:\n2017 Revenue on an adjusted basis\n$\n7,402\n$\n7,402\n2018 Equivalent revenue growth\n4\n%\n5\n%\n2018 Revenue outlook\n$\n7,698\n$\n7,772\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/quest-diagnostics-reports-first-quarter-2018-financial-results-300632579.html\nSOURCE Quest Diagnostics",
