    "text": "Net Income Rises 51 Percent to $1.73 Million Compared to Same Quarter Last Year\nNet Interest Margin Expands 15 Basis Points to 3.23% Compared to Prior Sequential Quarter\nNet Interest Income Rises Six Percent from the Same Quarter Last Year\nNon-Interest Expense Declines 10 Percent from the Same Quarter Last Year\nNon-Performing Assets Decline 21 Percent to $7.6 Million from June 30, 2017\nRIVERSIDE, Calif., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. (“Company”), (NASDAQ:PROV), the holding company for Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B. (“Bank”), today announced third quarter results for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported net income of $1.73 million, or $0.23 per diluted share (on 7.62 million average diluted shares outstanding), an increase of 51 percent from net income of $1.15 million, or $0.14 per diluted share (on 8.09 million average diluted shares outstanding), in the comparable period a year ago. Compared to the same quarter last year, the increase in earnings was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income, an increase in the recovery from the allowance for loan losses, and decreases in salaries and employee benefits and sales and marketing expenses, partly offset by a decrease in the gain on sale of loans and an increase in other non-interest expense.\n“Our community banking results continue to strengthen and the outlook for our community banking business is favorable,” said Craig G. Blunden, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “Unfortunately, and despite our aggressive response to date, weaker mortgage banking fundamentals have resulted in poorer performance from the business. We will continue to adjust our mortgage banking business model to improve on our results,” Mr. Blunden concluded.\nReturn on average assets for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased to 0.59 percent from 0.39 percent for the same period of fiscal 2017; and return on average stockholders’ equity for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased to 5.76 percent from 3.46 percent for the comparable period of fiscal 2017.\nOn a sequential quarter basis, the net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 of $1.73 million reflects a $2.51 million improvement from the net loss of $777,000 in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The increase in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 results compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to a $373,000 increase in net interest income, a $494,000 increase in the recovery from the allowance for loan losses, a $774,000 decrease in other non-interest expense and a $1.40 million decrease in the provision for income taxes, partly offset by a $720,000 decrease in the gain on sale of loans. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $0.23 per share, up from the $0.10 loss per share during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Return on average assets increased to 0.59 percent for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from a loss on average assets of 0.27 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2018; and return on average stockholders’ equity for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 5.76 percent, compared to a loss on average stockholders’ equity of 2.50 percent for the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nFor the nine months ended March 31, 2018, net income decreased $3.51 million, or 83 percent, to $731,000 from net income of $4.24 million in the comparable period ended March 31, 2017; and diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 decreased 81 percent to $0.10 per share (on 7.63 million average diluted shares outstanding) from $0.52 per share (on 8.13 million average diluted shares outstanding) for the comparable nine month period last year.\nNet interest income increased $477,000, or six percent, to $9.12 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from $8.65 million for the same quarter of fiscal 2017, attributable to an increase in the net interest margin, partly offset by a lower average interest-earning assets balance. The net interest margin during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 23 basis points to 3.23 percent from 3.00 percent in the same quarter last year, primarily due to an increase in the average yield of earning assets and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in the average cost of costing liabilities. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased by 22 basis points to 3.78 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from 3.56 percent in the same quarter last year and the average cost of liabilities decreased by two basis points to 0.62 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from 0.64 percent in the same quarter last year. The average balance of interest-earning assets decreased by $23.80 million, or two percent, to $1.13 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from $1.15 billion in the same quarter last year.\nThe average balance of loans receivable, including loans held for sale, decreased by $12.4 million, or one percent, to $961.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from $974.2 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2017, primarily due to a decrease in average loans held for sale attributable to a decrease in mortgage banking activity (primarily due to higher mortgage interest rates and the resulting lower refinance volume), partly offset by an increase in average loans held for investment. The average yield on loans receivable increased by 15 basis points to 4.13 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from an average yield of 3.98 percent in the same quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in the average loan yield was primarily attributable to an increase in the average yield of loans held for investment and an increase in the average yield of loans held for sale with a lower percentage of loans held for sale to total loans receivable. The average balance of loans held for investment in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $888.6 million with an average yield of 4.13 percent, up from $869.5 million with an average yield of 4.00 percent in the same quarter of fiscal 2017; while the average balance of loans held for sale in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $73.3 million with an average yield of 4.13 percent, down from $104.7 million with an average yield of 3.87 percent in the same quarter of fiscal 2017. The outstanding balance of “preferred loans” (multi-family, commercial real estate, construction and commercial business loans) decreased by $6.1 million, or one percent, to $579.0 million at March 31, 2018 from $585.1 million at June 30, 2017, net of undisbursed loan funds of $5.6 million and $9.0 million, respectively. The percentage of preferred loans to total loans held for investment at March 31, 2018 increased to 65 percent from 64 percent at June 30, 2017. Loan principal payments received in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $43.2 million, compared to $46.2 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2017.\nThe average balance of investment securities increased by $52.1 million, or 110 percent, to $99.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from $47.3 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to mortgage-backed securities purchases, partly offset by principal payments received on mortgage-backed securities. The average yield on investment securities increased 34 basis points to 1.54 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from 1.20 percent for the same quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in the average yield was primarily attributable to mortgage-backed securities purchases which had higher average yields than the existing portfolio and the repricing of variable rate investment securities to higher market interest rates.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) – San Francisco distributed $144,000 of quarterly cash dividends to the Bank, a $40,000 or 22 percent decrease from the cash dividends received by the Bank in the same quarter last year.\nThe average balance of the Company’s interest-earning deposits, primarily cash with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, decreased $63.6 million, or 51 percent, to $61.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from $125.2 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease in interest-earning deposits was primarily due to the purchases of investment securities. The average yield earned on interest-earning deposits in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 1.51 percent, up 71 basis points from 0.80 percent in the same quarter of fiscal 2017 as a result of the impact of the increases in the federal funds rate over the last year.\nAverage deposits decreased $16.0 million, or two percent, to $912.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from $928.0 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2017. The average cost of deposits decreased by two basis points to 0.38 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from 0.40 percent in the same quarter last year, primarily due to a lower percentage of time deposits to total deposit. Transaction account balances or “core deposits” increased $18.4 million, or three percent, to $677.0 million at March 31, 2018 from $658.6 million at June 30, 2017, while time deposits decreased $22.4 million, or eight percent, to $245.5 million at March 31, 2018 from $267.9 million at June 30, 2017, consistent with the Bank’s strategy to decrease the percentage of time deposits in its deposit base and to increase the percentage of checking and savings accounts.\nThe average balance of borrowings, which consisted of FHLB – San Francisco advances, increased $1.3 million, or one percent, to $112.6 million and the average cost of advances decreased four basis points to 2.56 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to an average balance of $111.3 million with an average cost of 2.60 percent in the same quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease in the average cost of advances was primarily due to the maturity of a long-term advance which was renewed at a lower cost in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded a recovery from the allowance for loan losses of $505,000, compared to the recovery from the allowance for loan losses of $165,000 recorded during the same period of fiscal 2017 and the recovery from the allowance for loan losses of $11,000 recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 (sequential quarter). The recovery from the allowance for loan losses was primarily attributable to the improving risk profile of the loan portfolio as reflected in the asset quality ratios and loan balances shifting to lower risk categories from higher risk categories.\nNon-performing assets, with underlying collateral located in California, decreased $2.0 million, or 21 percent, to $7.6 million, or 0.64 percent of total assets, at March 31, 2018, compared to $9.6 million, or 0.80 percent of total assets, at June 30, 2017. Non-performing loans decreased $1.2 million, or 15 percent, to $6.8 million at March 31, 2018 from $8.0 million at June 30, 2017. The non-performing loans at March 31, 2018 are comprised of 24 single-family loans ($6.7 million) and one commercial business loan ($58,000). At March 31, 2018, real estate owned was $787,000, a decline of $828,000, or 51%, from $1.6 million at June 30, 2017 and was comprised of two single-family real estate owned properties acquired during the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\nNet loan charge-offs for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $39,000 or 0.02 percent (annualized) of average loans receivable, compared to net loan recoveries of $49,000 or (0.02) percent (annualized) of average loans receivable for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and net loan recoveries of $23,000 or (0.01) percent (annualized) of average loans receivable for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 (sequential quarter).\nClassified assets at March 31, 2018 were $11.9 million, comprised of $2.8 million of loans in the special mention category, $8.3 million of loans in the substandard category and $787,000 in real estate owned; while classified assets at June 30, 2017 were $13.3 million, comprised of $3.7 million of loans in the special mention category, $8.0 million of loans in the substandard category and $1.6 million in real estate owned.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, two loans totaling $2.2 million were restructured from their original terms and classified as restructured loans. The outstanding restructured loans at March 31, 2018 were $5.4 million, up from $3.6 million at June 30, 2017, of which $3.7 million or 68 percent were current at March 31, 2018, with respect to their modified payment terms.\nThe allowance for loan losses was $7.5 million at March 31, 2018, or 0.84 percent of gross loans held for investment, compared to $8.0 million at June 30, 2017, or 0.88 percent of gross loans held for investment. Management believes that, based on currently available information, the allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb potential losses inherent in loans held for investment at March 31, 2018.\nNon-interest income decreased by $1.58 million, or 23 percent, to $5.21 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from $6.79 million in the same period of fiscal 2017, primarily as a result of a decrease in the gain on sale of loans during the current quarter as compared to the comparable period last year. On a sequential quarter basis, non-interest income decreased $531,000, or nine percent, primarily as a result of a decrease in the gain on sale of loans.\nThe gain on sale of loans decreased $1.80 million, or 33 percent, to $3.60 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from $5.40 million in the comparable quarter last year, and decreased $720,000 or 17 percent from the quarter ended December 31, 2017 (sequential quarter), reflecting the impact of a lower loan sale volume and a lower average loan sale margin. Total loan sale volume, which includes the net change in commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for sale, was $235.5 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, down $106.7 million or 31 percent, from $342.2 million in the comparable quarter last year and decreased $52.3 million or 18 percent from $287.8 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2017 (sequential quarter). The average loan sale margin from mortgage banking was 153 basis points for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, a decrease of five basis points from 158 basis points in the same quarter last year, yet four basis points higher than 149 basis points in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 (sequential quarter). The gain on sale of loans includes an unfavorable fair-value adjustment on loans held for sale and derivative financial instruments (commitments to extend credit, commitments to sell loans, commitments to sell mortgage-backed securities, and option contracts) that amounted to a net loss of $844,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to a favorable fair-value adjustment that amounted to a net gain of $635,000 in the same period last year and an unfavorable fair-value adjustment that amounted to a net loss of $1.30 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 (sequential quarter).\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2018, $220.2 million of loans were originated and purchased for sale, 31 percent lower than the $317.9 million for the same period last year, and 34 percent lower than the $331.9 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 (sequential quarter). The loan origination volume has decreased from the previous year as a result of increased mortgage interest rates reducing refinance activity. Total loans sold during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $225.9 million, 39 percent lower than the $369.5 million sold during the same quarter last year, and 37 percent lower than the $361.4 million sold during the second quarter of fiscal 2018 (sequential quarter). Total loan originations (including loans originated and purchased for investment and loans originated and purchased for sale) were $269.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, a decrease of 28 percent from $375.9 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2017, and 27 percent lower than the $366.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 (sequential quarter).\nNon-interest expenses decreased $1.33 million, or 10 percent, to $12.44 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 from $13.77 million in the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.56 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense and a $208,000 decrease in sales and marketing expense, partly offset by a $373,000 increase in other non-interest expenses (primarily attributable to the $668,000 reversal of loan origination liability accruals in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 which was not replicated this quarter). The decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense was primarily related to lower variable compensation resulting from lower mortgage banking loan originations and staff reductions in mortgage banking. On a sequential quarter basis, non-interest expenses decreased $774,000 or six percent from $13.21 million, primarily as a result of a $773,000 decrease in other non-interest expenses (primarily attributable to the $650,000 litigation expense accrual recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 which was not replicated this quarter).\nThe Company’s efficiency ratio in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was 87 percent, an improvement from 89 percent in the same quarter last year and an improvement from 91 percent in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 (sequential quarter).\nThe Company’s income tax provision was $667,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, down three percent from the $690,000 provision for income taxes in the same quarter last year. The decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction of the federal income tax rate resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, partly offset by higher income before taxes. In addition, our fiscal year end requires the use of a blended rate as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code, which is 28.06% and will be used through June 30, 2018. On a sequential quarter basis, the provision for income taxes decreased $1.40 million, or 68 percent, from $2.07 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily attributable to the $1.84 million write-down of net deferred tax assets following a deferred tax revaluation resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The Company believes that the tax provision recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 reflects its current income tax obligations.\nThe Company repurchased 77,681 shares of its common stock during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 at an average cost of $18.21 per share. As of March 31, 2018, a total of 344,207 shares or 89 percent of the shares authorized in the June 2017 stock repurchase plan have been purchased, leaving 40,993 shares available for future purchases through June 19, 2018.\nThe Bank currently operates 14 retail/business banking offices in Riverside County and San Bernardino County (Inland Empire). Provident Bank Mortgage operates two wholesale loan production offices and nine retail loan production offices located throughout California.\nThe Company will host a conference call for institutional investors and bank analysts on Thursday, April 26, 2018 at 9:00 a.m. (Pacific) to discuss its financial results.
