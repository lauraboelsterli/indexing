    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, April 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Kindred Biosciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: KIN), a biopharmaceutical company focused on saving and improving the lives of pets, today announced that it has received a response from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls technical section for Zimeta IV for the control of fever in horses. The FDA has no additional questions or requests for KindredBio regarding this submission. The FDA stated that the approval is pending the pre-approval inspection, or PAI, at the contract manufacturer of Zimeta IV scheduled for July 2018, and an acceptable resolution by the contract manufacturer of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) dipyrone of findings identified during an inspection conducted this month. KindredBio believes that the findings at the API manufacturer are minor and addressable.\nKindredBio continues to anticipate approval of its first product, Miratazâ„¢ (mirtazapine transdermal ointment), for the management of weight loss in cats on or before the May 6, 2018 action date. The FDA does not have any additional questions or requests from KindredBio, final label negotiations have been completed, and all of the required inspections have been completed successfully at the contract manufacturers.\nThe Company will provide further program and corporate updates during its first quarter 2018 financial call on Tuesday, May 8, 2018 at 4:30 PM Eastern Time / 1:30 PM Pacific Time.
