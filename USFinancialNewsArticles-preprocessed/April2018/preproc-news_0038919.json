    "text": "AMMAN (Reuters) - Pro-Iranian-Hezbollah militiaâ€™s media unit said on Tuesday Syrian air defenses had intercepted three missiles aimed at Dumair military airport north east of Damascus.\nSyrian state media made no mention of the strike on Dumair but earlier said its air defenses had shot down missiles above the main Shuyrat air base in Homs province.\nOpposition forces say Dumair airport had been used in the military campaign to regain eastern Ghouta, a rebel enclave on the outskirts of Damascus that the Syrian army, backed by Russian air power, completely retook in the last few days after a relentless bombing offensive.\nReporting by Suleiman Al-Khalidi; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ",
