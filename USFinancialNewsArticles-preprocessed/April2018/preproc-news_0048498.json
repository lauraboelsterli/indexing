Adjusted 1 net income of $51.2 million, or $0.34 per share.\nCEO COMMENTARY:\n“Our record start to 2018 was driven by continued strong commercial loan growth, disciplined expense management, controlled deposit costs and excellent credit quality,” said Old National Bancorp Chairman and CEO Bob Jones. “In keeping with our ongoing focus on improving the operating dynamics of the franchise, we also announced our decision to sell 10 branches and consolidate an additional 10 branches throughout our franchise.”\nFIRST-QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS 2 :\nNet Income\nNet income of $48.0 million, an increase of 33.3% from first quarter of 2017 Earnings per share of $0.31, an increase of 14.8% from first quarter of 2017\nNet Interest Income/NIM\nNet interest income was $128.5 million, up 8.4% Net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was 3.45% compared to 3.47%\nOperating Performance\nPre-provision net revenue 1 (“PPNR”) was $56.1 million Adjusted PPNR 1 was $61.1 million, up 5.9% Noninterest expense was $117.6 million Adjusted noninterest expense 1 was $111.8 million, compared to $110.2 million Efficiency ratio 1 was 65.94% Adjusted efficiency ratio 1 was 62.59%, a 118 basis point improvement from first quarter of 2017\nLoans and Credit Quality\nEnd-of-period total loans 3 were $11,256.3 million compared to $11,136.1 million Represents 4.3% annualized growth End-of-period commercial and commercial real estate loans were $7,261.6 million compared to $7,071.8 million Represents 10.7% annualized growth Non-performing loans were 1.28% of total loans compared to 1.30% Provision for loan losses was $0.4 million compared to $1.0 million Net charge-offs were $0.4 million, or 0.01% annualized, compared to 0.03%\nCapital Returns\nReturn on average equity was 8.86% Return on average tangible common equity 1 was 15.80% Adjusted return on average tangible common equity 1 was 16.81%\nNotable Items\n$2.3 million in merger and integration charges $2.8 million for branch consolidation charges $0.7 million in tax credit amortization Footprint rationalization continues with 10 branch consolidations and the pending sale of 10 branches\n1 Non-GAAP financial measure that Management believes is useful in evaluating the financial results of the Company. Please refer to the Non-GAAP reconciliations contained in this release 2 Comparisons are on a linked-quarter basis, unless otherwise noted 3 Includes loans held for sale\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOld National Bancorp reported first-quarter 2018 net income of $48.0 million, or $0.31 per diluted share.\nIncluded in the first quarter were pre-tax charges of $2.3 million for merger and integration and $2.8 million for branch consolidations. Excluding these items from the current quarter and netting out securities gains, Old National would have reported net income of $51.2 million, or $0.34 per share.\nWith a continued focus on expense management, 10 branches located throughout the footprint are scheduled to be consolidated; 9 in the second quarter and 1 in the third quarter of this year. In addition, Old National entered into a branch purchase and assumption agreement for the sale of 10 Old National branches in Wisconsin to Marine Credit Union of La Crosse, Wisconsin. The branch sale includes the assumption of approximately $274 million in deposits and no loans. Subject to regulatory approval and other terms and conditions, the sale is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018.\nLOANS\nRecord first quarter performance was fueled by double-digit commercial loan growth.\nPeriod-end total loans increased to $11,256.3 million at March 31, 2018, up from $11,136.1 million at December 31, 2017. End-of-period total loan growth in the first quarter was $120.2 million, or 4.3% on an annualized basis. End-of-period growth in total commercial and commercial real estate loans was $189.8 million, or 10.7% on an annualized basis. On average, total loans in the first quarter were $11,179.3 million, up from $10,516.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Average total loans increased $662.9 million, or 25% annualized, benefitting from a full quarter’s impact of loans acquired from the Minnesota partnership, which closed on November 1, 1017. Average total commercial and commercial real estate loan growth was $683.0 million, or 42.2% on an annualized basis, including impact of loans acquired from the Minnesota partnership.\nDEPOSITS\nA low-cost core deposit franchise continues to be one of Old National’s strengths.\nPeriod-end total deposits increased to $12,788.6 million at March 31, 2018, up from $12,605.8 million at December 31, 2017. End-of-period deposit growth in the first quarter was $182.8 million, or 5.8% on an annualized basis. On average, total deposits in the first quarter were $12,579.2 million, increasing from the $11,994.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Average total deposits increased $584.4 million, or 19.5% annualized, benefitting from a full quarter’s impact of deposits assumed from the Minnesota partnership.\nNET INTEREST INCOME AND MARGIN\nWell-controlled deposit costs and higher accretion income offset lower fully taxable equivalent (FTE) interest income resulting from income tax rate change.\nNet interest income increased to $128.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $118.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The net interest margin (on a fully taxable equivalent basis) declined just 2 basis points to 3.45% compared to 3.47% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Benefiting net interest income and net interest margin during the quarter was the increase in short term rates, strong loan production and accretion income given a full quarter of the Minnesota partnership. Partially offsetting these benefits was higher interest expense, lower interest collected on nonaccrual loans, and a decline in fully taxable equivalent interest income as a result of lower corporate income tax rates. Accretion income increased to $11.0 million, or 28 basis points of net interest margin, in the first quarter of 2018 from $7.5 million, or 21 basis points of net interest margin, in the fourth quarter of 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, accretion income was 6% of adjusted total revenue compared to 8% in the first quarter of 2017. The cost of total deposits rose just 3 basis points to 0.23% while the cost of total interest-bearing deposits rose just 4 basis points to 0.33%.\nCREDIT QUALITY\nExceptional credit quality remains a hallmark of the Old National franchise.\nAsset quality remained strong with net charge-offs of just $0.4 million, or 0.01% of total average loans, and 30-89 day delinquencies of 0.33%. Provision expense for the first quarter was $0.4 million, matching net charge-offs of $0.4 million. Non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans continued to decline to 1.28% from 1.30%. In accordance with current accounting practices, the loans acquired from recent acquisitions were recorded at fair value with no allowance recorded at the acquisition date. As of March 31, 2018, the remaining discount on these acquired loans was $125.6 million. The allowance for loan losses was $50.4 million, or 0.45% of total loans at March 31, 2018.\nNONINTEREST INCOME\nNoninterest income dipped slightly due to seasonality and other factors.\nTotal noninterest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $42.4 million, or a decline of $2.4 million from the fourth quarter of 2017. Lower capital markets income ($0.4 million), a decline in other income ($0.5 million), a decline in wealth management revenue ($0.8 million) and the seasonal decline in deposit service charges ($0.2 million) were the main drivers of the quarterly decline. Securities gains were $0.8 million, down $0.8 million from the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNONINTEREST EXPENSE\nDisciplined expense management drives positive operating leverage 1 .\nNoninterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $117.6 million and included $2.3 million in merger and integration charges, $2.8 million in branch charges and $0.7 million in tax credit amortization. Excluding these items, adjusted noninterest expense for the first quarter was $111.8 million, slightly higher than the $110.2 million in adjusted noninterest expense in the fourth quarter of 2017. The first quarter included a full quarterly impact of the Minnesota partnership. Adjusted operating leverage 1 improved 184 basis points in the first quarter compared to a year ago. First quarter includes typical seasonal factors, including higher snow removal costs ($0.7 million), higher postage costs ($0.4 million) and higher salary expense due to payroll tax reset and annual HSA contribution. The first quarter efficiency ratio was 65.94% while the adjusted efficiency ratio was 62.59%.\nINCOME TAXES\nChanges in the corporate tax rate as well as benefits of tax credits result in lower tax rates.\nOn a fully taxable-equivalent basis, income tax expense in the first quarter was $7.7 million, resulting in a 13.9% FTE tax rate.\nCAPITAL\nStrong quarterly earnings drive capital ratios higher.\nAt the end of the first quarter, total risk-based capital was 11.7% and regulatory tier 1 capital was 10.7%. Tangible common equity to tangible assets was 7.83% at the end of the first quarter compared to 7.65% in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS\n($ in millions, except EPS, shares in 000s) 1Q18 Adjustments 4 Adjusted 1Q18 Total Revenues (FTE) $ 173.7 ($ 0.8 ) $ 172.9 Less: Provision for Loan Losses (0.4 ) - (0.4 ) Less: Noninterest Expenses (117.6 ) 5.1 (112.5 ) Income before Income Taxes (FTE) $ 55.7 $ 4.3 $ 60.0 Income Taxes (7.7 ) (1.1 ) (8.8 ) Net Income $ 48.0 $ 3.2 $ 51.2 Average Shares Outstanding 152,370 - 152,370 Earnings Per Share $ 0.31 $ 0.03 $ 0.34 4 Tax-effect calculations use the 2018 statutory FTE tax rates (federal + state)\n($ in millions) 1Q18 4Q17 Net Interest Income $ 128.5 $ 118.6 FTE Adjustment 2.8 6.1 Net Interest Income (FTE Basis) $ 131.3 $ 124.7 Average Earning Assets $ 15,205.9 $ 14,389.5 Net Interest Margin 3.45 % 3.47 %\n($ in millions) 1Q18 4Q17 Net Interest Income $ 128.5 $ 118.6 FTE Adjustment 2.8 6.1 Net Interest Income (FTE Basis) $ 131.3 $ 124.7 Total Noninterest Income $ 42.4 $ 44.8 Noninterest Expense 117.6 140.4 Pre-Provision Net Revenue $ 56.1 $ 29.1 Less: Securities Gains (0.8 ) (1.6 ) Add: Merger and Integration Charges 2.3 11.9 Add: Branch Consolidations, Severance, Foundation Funding and Client Experience Initiative Charges 2.8 6.6 Add: Amortization of Tax Credit Investments 0.7 11.7 Adjusted Pre-Provision Net Revenue $ 61.1 $ 57.7\n($ in millions) 1Q18 4Q17 1Q17 Noninterest Expense $ 117.6 $ 140.4 $ 101.9 Less: Merger and Integration Charges (2.3 ) (11.9 ) - Less: Branch Consolidations, Severance, Foundation Funding and Client Experience Initiative Charges (2.8 ) (6.6 ) (1.4 ) Noninterest Expense less Charges $ 112.5 $ 121.9 $ 100.5 Less: Amortization of Tax Credit Investments (0.7 ) (11.7 ) - Adjusted Noninterest Expense $ 111.8 $ 110.2 $ 100.5 Less: Intangible Amortization (3.6 ) (3.4 ) (3.0 ) Adjusted Noninterest Expense Less Intangible Amortization $ 108.2 $ 106.8 $ 97.5 Net Interest Income $ 128.5 $ 118.6 $ 105.8 FTE Adjustment 2.8 6.1 5.7 Net Interest Income (FTE) $ 131.3 $ 124.7 $ 111.5 Total Noninterest Income $ 42.4 $ 44.8 $ 42.9 Total Revenue (FTE) $ 173.7 $ 169.5 $ 154.4 Less: Securities Gains (0.8 ) (1.6 ) (1.5 ) Adjusted Total Revenue (FTE) $ 172.9 $ 167.9 $ 152.9 Efficiency Ratio 65.94 % 81.60 % 64.66 % Adjusted Efficiency Ratio 62.59 % 63.58 % 63.77 % Operating Leverage 5 (basis points) (295 ) Adjusted Operating Leverage 6 (basis points) 184 5 Year-over-year basis point change in noninterest expenses plus change in total revenue\n6 Year-over-year basis point change in adjusted noninterest expense plus change in adjusted total revenue\n($ in millions) 1Q18 4Q17 Net Income (Loss) $ 48.0 $ (18.5 ) Add: Intangible Amortization (net of tax) 2.8 2.2 Tangible Net Income (Loss) $ 50.8 $ (16.3 ) Less: Securities Gains (net of tax 7 ) (0.6 ) (1.1 ) Add: Merger & Integration Charges (net of tax 7 ) 1.8 8.4 Add: Branch Consolidations, Severance, Foundation Funding, Client Experience Initiative Charges (net of tax 7 ) 2.1 4.6 Add: Estimated DTA Revaluation - 39.3 Adjusted Tangible Net Income (Loss) $ 54.1 $ 34.9 Average Total Shareholders’ Equity $ 2,166.1 $ 2,104.6 Less: Average Goodwill (828.1 ) (776.9 ) Less: Average Intangibles (51.1 ) (37.8 ) Average Tangible Shareholders’ Equity $ 1,286.8 $ 1,289.9 Return on Average Tangible Common Equity 15.80 % (5.05 %) Adjusted Return on Average Tangible Common Equity 16.81 % 10.83 % 7 Tax-effect calculations use the 2018 statutory FTE tax rates (federal + state)\nCONFERENCE CALL AND WEBCAST\nOld National will host a conference call and live webcast at 7:00 a.m. Central Time on Monday, April 23, 2018, to review first-quarter 2018 financial results.
