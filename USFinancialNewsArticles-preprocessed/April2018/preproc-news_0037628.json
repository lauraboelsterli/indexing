    "text": "19 COMMENTS The world’s biggest consumer-products makers are struggling to raise prices, as increasingly fierce competition keeps a lid on sales growth.\nProcter & Gamble Co. PG -3.15% , the maker of Tide and Bounty, on Thursday said prices fell by 2% for the first three months of 2018. Prices fell across P&G’s businesses, with the biggest decline at its Gillette shaving brand, which has slashed prices to fend off low-cost rivals Dollar Shave Club, owned by rival Unilever UL -2.79% PLC, and Harry’s.\nUnilever, which sells Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream, said it was able to raise prices just 0.1% in the first quarter, while Nestlé SA reported price growth of 0.2%. The growth rates were the weakest for those European companies since 2010 and 2000, respectively, according to analysts at Bernstein.\nThe consumer-products industry has long relied on selling new or improved versions of products at higher prices to boost growth. That practice is now challenged by weak inflation, Amazon.com Inc.’s rising prowess in selling more household staples, and a decline in brand loyalty as consumers use the internet to shop around. A shift to discount retailers, from dollar stores to Germany’s Aldi, are further pushing down prices.\nAll three consumer-goods giants had to rely, instead, on selling more products to lift sales in the latest quarter.\nP&G Chief Executive David Taylor said there has been a fundamental shift in dynamics around pricing and how consumers shop. P&G, years into a turnaround that as recently as last year executives said was working, needs to step up those efforts, he said.\n“Changes must be made, and the cost structure demands are real,” Mr. Taylor said. “What we anticipated is not sufficient. We need to do more.”\nMr. Taylor said he continues to believe shoppers will still pay more for products that offer significant benefits, such as Tide Pods laundry packets.\nP&G executives said the planned $4.2 billion acquisition of the consumer-health business from Germany’s Merck KGaA adds products, namely vitamins and supplements, that succeeded in holding the line on price.\nP&G reported a 4.3% rise in net sales to $16.28 billion, helped by currency movements. Stripping out foreign exchange and deal making, sales rose 1%, thanks to a volume increase of 2%. Net profit slipped 0.4%, however, as input costs rose.\nThe company said price cuts on Gillette razors and volatility in some international markets, including Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Nigeria, contributed to weakness. Retailers are slashing inventory as they work to improve cash flow, P&G said. It is a “very tough environment,” said finance chief Jon Moeller.\nUnilever on Thursday reported a 3.4% rise in first-quarter underlying sales, which strip out foreign-exchange movements. Nestlé posted 2.8% growth in organic sales, which exclude currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures.\n“Pricing is the big theme for this morning,” Unilever’s finance chief, Graeme Pitkethly, said in an interview. “It looks like we’ve gone from all price and no volume to all volume and no price.”\nRelated\nP&G Slogs Through ‘Difficult’ Markets for Sales Growth Prices for the Anglo-Dutch maker of Hellmann’s mayonnaise were held back by a handful of big markets like India, Brazil, Indonesia and the U.K., which together make up 25% of Unilever’s sales, Mr. Pitkethly said. He also said it was harder to charge more in the U.S., which accounts for 15% of sales, where there was heavy discounting.\nMr. Pitkethly said Unilever was able to raise prices in other markets, like Turkey, Mexico, the Netherlands and Eastern Europe. He said he expects the company to strike a better balance between volume and price growth in the second half of the year.\n“We’re not concerned about relatively low pricing in aggregate,” he said on an investor call. “It’s really not worth overthinking the price growth in any given quarter.”\nUnilever is less exposed to the price wars hitting some of its big U.S.-based rivals because it doesn’t sell products like diapers and toilet paper, which have been fiercely hit by Amazon and the rise of discounters Aldi and Lidl.\nThe company also announced a share-buyback program of up to €6 billion ($7.43 billion) starting next month to return cash accrued from the sale of its spreads business. Unilever in December agreed to sell the unit to U.S. private-equity firm KKR for €6.83 billion after years of declines.\nUnilever reported a 5.2% fall in first-quarter revenue to €12.6 billion from a year earlier.\nNestlé blamed weak price growth on lower levels of inflation in emerging markets, saying prices declined in Brazil as well as Western and Eastern Europe. Prices in North America were slightly positive. The owner of Purina pet foods and Nescafé coffee said total sales for the three months to March 31 were 21.26 billion Swiss francs ($21.97 billion), compared with 21 billion francs a year earlier.\nLike other consumer-goods companies, Nestlé has struggled to keep pace with changing consumer tastes toward locally grown, organic food, while at the same time being limited in raising prices amid a weak inflation trend globally.\nOn Thursday, Nestlé reported a return to growth in its biggest market, the U.S., with the company citing “an improved performance in pet care, particularly in the natural segment and the e-commerce channel.”\nWrite to Saabira Chaudhuri at saabira.chaudhuri@wsj.com , Brian Blackstone at brian.blackstone@wsj.com and Sharon Terlep at sharon.terlep@wsj.com",
