    "text": "By Grace Donnelly April 11, 2018 \nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) announced Wednesday that he will not seek re-election this fall , making him just the latest of more than two dozen Congressional Republicans who have decided against running for another term. \nRyan’s departure leaves 24 Republican-held seats open for the 2018 midterms. Another three Republican senators are also not seeking re-election. \nMany attribute their decision to leave Congress to the hyper-polarized environment, poor approval ratings and difficulties the Trump administration has created for Republicans in re-election campaigns. Republican lawmakers were more likely to resign or retire if Trump was less popular in their district in 2016 , according to CNN. \nHere’s a list of all the Republican lawmakers who have announced their resignation from Congress, where the GOP currently holds a 51-49 majority in the Senate and a 237-192 majority in the House : Senate Republicans not seeking re-election \nSen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) \nAfter flirting with the idea of a third term, Corker decided against re-election in February . The announcement came after several public feuds with President Trump beginning in May 2017, in which the president tweeted that he advised Corker on his plans to run in 2018. Strange statement by Bob Corker considering that he is constantly asking me whether or not he should run again in '18. Tennessee not happy! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2017 \nOne of the wealthiest members of the Senate, Corker was criticized for reversing his opposition to the Republican tax cut plan in December after raising concerns about the federal deficit. He has since called the Trump Administration “fiscally irresponsible” and said the tax bill was “one of the worst votes” he’s made during his tenure. \nSen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) \nSenator Jeff Flake said in Oct. 2017 that he would not seek re-election . “Mr. President, I will not be complicit,” he said in a speech on the Senate floor that sharply criticized President Trump . Flake, who has served in the Senate since 2013, has been one of the most outspoken members of the GOP when it comes to the Trump presidency along with fellow Arizona Senator John McCain, who is not expected to run again. \nSen. Orrin Hatch (R- Utah) \nHatch announced in January that he would not run for a third term. The 86-year-old is the longest-sitting member of the Senate. “I’ve always been a fighter,” he said in a statement. “I was an amateur boxer in my youth, and I brought that fighting spirit with me to Washington. But every good fighter knows when to hang up the gloves .” Former Massachusetts governor and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney will run for Hatch’s open seat in Utah . House Republicans not seeking re-election \nThe midterm elections will include battles for 24 open House seats currently held by Republicans, with six of these races in Texas, three in Pennsylvania, and three in California: \nRep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) ",
