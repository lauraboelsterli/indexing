    "text": "ANDOVER, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ndd Medical Technologies, Inc., the leader in lung function testing, announced that Patti Peters, the long-term Vice President of Sales and Marketing, handed over the reins to Thomas Sinclair. Tom has held several positions at Medtronic, most recently as Director of Sales, Alternate Site in Boulder, CO. Patti will continue her full-time role at ndd and assumes the title of Senior Director Strategic Accounts.\n“Patti joined ndd in 1999 and pioneered the establishment of the EasyOne brand and instituted ndd products as market leader in spirometry in the U.S. among opinion leaders in clinical research, the medical community and with our distribution partners,” noted ndd Medical Technologies, Inc. Founder and Chairman of the Board, Dr. Karl Harnoncourt. “Her deep understanding of the ndd brand and more importantly, the ever-evolving needs of our customers will be crucial assets to support the continuous growth of ndd’s innovative products for early diagnosis of lung disease.”\nPatti Peters: “The past 19 years have been a rewarding experience for me and I’m thrilled we have identified Tom Sinclair as my successor. I feel extremely confident in his ability to lead the continuous expansion of the ndd brand in the US and Canadian medical community.”\nTom Sinclair joins ndd after more than 13 years with Medtronic. Tom’s leadership experience in both Acute and Alternate Site markets has him uniquely positioned to help ndd execute on our core mission of driving early detection for people living with COPD and other chronic lung diseases. “It is an exciting opportunity to join an organization with tremendous potential and superior technology and grow the business in a meaningful way to create better patient outcome and reduce cost for the medical community,” says Tom. In his nearly 20 years of sales and marketing experience, he has a proven track record of success in driving market growth in mature product lines and successful new product launches, which makes his hiring a perfect fit with ndd’s expanding market presence.\nAbout ndd Medical Technologies\nFor more than 20 years ndd has worked to improve the early detection and accurate diagnosis for people living with COPD and other chronic lung diseases with EasyOne products. In that time, ndd has grown to be the leading global innovator in PFT devices by supporting research, helping to create awareness, launching innovative products and making them available in over 100 countries.\nThe EasyOne product line was developed for physicians to offer accurate and reliable diagnosis at the point of care and start immediate treatment.
