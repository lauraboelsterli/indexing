View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180411005018/en/\nMichael Fabry, General Manager, DSP Concepts GmbH (Photo: Business Wire)\nFabry is best-known as one of the founders of automotive audio engineering firm S1nn Gmbh & Co. KG, where he played a key role in the development of the sound systems in the Tesla Model X and S, which Germany’s Auto Motor und Sport called “extraordinary.” He joined DSP Concepts GmbH in 2016 as senior director of automotive audio systems, where he oversaw growth of the Stuttgart engineering team and expanded the adoption of DSP Concepts’ Audio Weaver voice UI and automotive audio algorithms to a broader base of automotive OEMs and Tier 1s.\nIn his new role, Fabry will focus on further enhancing and expanding Audio Weaver’s capabilities, while helping DSP Concepts customers improve the performance of their automotive voice command, audio entertainment and sound synthesis systems—all of which are increasingly important to automotive sales, safety and the end-user experience.\nPrior to his work at DSP Concepts and S1nn, Fabry has also held senior engineering positions at Harman Becker Automotive Systems and Bose Corporation.\n“We’re extremely fortunate to have Michael leading our European business effort. His deep knowledge and extensive contacts in the automotive industry have been instrumental in creating and expanding our relationships with the key players in that field,” said Dr. Paul Beckmann, founder and CTO of DSP Concepts. “Thanks largely to Michael, we’ve seen our technologies incorporated into some of the most advanced vehicles on the road today, and they’ll be included in many of the key product introductions of the next five years.”\nAbout DSP Concepts\nDSP Concepts, Inc. provides embedded audio digital signal processing solutions delivered through its Audio Weaver® platform.
