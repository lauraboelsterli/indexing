    "text": "PHILADELPHIA and ABU DHABI, UAE , April 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hill International (NYSE:HIL), the global leader in managing construction risk, announced today Abdo E. Kardous, currently Hill’s Senior Vice President and Managing Director for the Asia/Pacific Region, will assume the post of Regional President for the Middle East. Kardous replaces Mohammed Al Rais, who is resigning his position with the company as of April 19.\nKardous joined Hill in 1997 as part of the Hill team managing the Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan Mosque in Abu Dhabi. He was promoted to Vice President in Hill’s Dubai office, and rose to SVP Middle East before assuming leadership of Hill’s Asia/Pacific work operations.\nAbdo is a member of both the American Society of Civil Engineers and the Institute of Transportation Engineers. He holds a B.S., Magna Cum Laude, in Civil Engineering, from the University of Maryland and an M.S. in Civil Engineering from the University of California, Berkley. He was also Hill International’s Project Manager of the Year in 2001. In total, Abdo brings more than 30 years of experience to the Middle East region, with expertise in the design, procurement, construction, and delivery of multi-billion dollar projects in the residential, hospitality, energy, infrastructure, and marine sectors, among others.\nRaouf S. Ghali, Hill’s President and Chief Operating Officer, said of the promotion, “Mohammed’s work in growing our MER business and overseeing our many mega-projects in the area was exceptional, and we thank him for his leadership and dedication. Going forward, Abdo brings the right experience to continue to refine and improve our MER operations, and to build on the hard work accomplished to date in the region.”\nHill International, with more than 3,000 professionals in more than 50 offices worldwide, provides program management, project management, construction management and other consulting services to clients in a variety of market sectors. Engineering News-Record magazine recently ranked Hill as the eighth-largest construction management firm in the United States.
