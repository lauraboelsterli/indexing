    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon said on Sunday it was not conducting air strikes in Syria “at this time,” formally denying a Syrian state television report that the U.S. military had fired missiles at a Syrian government air base.\n“At this time, the Department of Defense is not conducting air strikes in Syria,” the Pentagon said in a statement. “However, we continue to closely watch the situation and support the ongoing diplomatic efforts to hold those who use chemical weapons, in Syria and otherwise, accountable.”\nReporting by Matt Spetalnick; Editing by Stephen Coates\n ",
