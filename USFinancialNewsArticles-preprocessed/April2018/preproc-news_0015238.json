    "text": "0 COMMENTS LONDON—BSG Resources Ltd., the mining company formerly controlled by Israeli tycoon Beny Steinmetz, has suffered a legal setback in its efforts to win compensation for being stripped of the rights to one of the world’s richest iron-ore deposits.\nThe dispute over Guinea’s highly prized iron-ore field, named after the West African nation’s remote Simandou mountain range, has been one of the most contentious in the mining industry over the past decade.\nIt has involved allegations of corruption and some of the industry’s biggest names.\nGuinea, in 2014, withdrew BSGR’s mining rights at Simandou, alleging bribes were paid to win the concession. BSGR rejected the claim and challenged the Guinean government’s decision at the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, or ICSID.\nBSGR said it was the victim of a conspiracy to strip it of its concession and that numerous documents Guinea presented to support the government’s corruption allegations were forgeries. Two BSGR executives testified in an ICSID hearing in Paris last year that their signatures on certain documents in the case were forged.\nBSGR asked the ICSID, the globally recognized arbiter in such disputes involving governments, to throw out an independent report commissioned by the World Bank body that determined there was no sign the documents or signatures were forged. The ICSID on Wednesday rejected BSGR’s motion to throw out the report, according to a procedural order reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The document didn’t detail why the tribunal rejected BSGR’s motion to disqualify the final report.\nDaniel Balint-Kurti, a researcher for London-based corruption watchdog Global Witness, which has closely tracked BSGR’s business in Guinea, said the tribunal’s decision to allow the final report could make it harder for the company to rebut allegations that it paid bribes to win the iron-ore concessions. It is unclear when the tribunal will issue a final ruling in the case.\nJames Lisbon, a lawyer for Mishcon de Reyna LLP, which has represented BSGR in the ICSID case said “there has been no determination of the authenticity of the documents.” A World Bank representative declined to comment.\nThe World Bank body’s decision marks another setback for Mr. Steinmetz, who last year testified before the tribunal. The diamond magnate in August was detained by Israeli authorities for questioning in a fraud probe.\nHe has been released though the government has restricted his travel.\nMr. Steinmetz has denied accusations of wrongdoing.\nBSGR, through the ICSID process, is seeking to have either the Simandou rights returned or as much as $5 billion in compensation, according to a spokesman. Guinea believes its claim in the case could be more than $1 billion, a spokesman for the government said.\nIn March, BSGR placed itself into voluntary administration, a proceeding similar to U.S. bankruptcy filing, a move that can protect it from creditors. BSGR is registered in Guernsey, a U.K. territory.\nIn 2008, the mining company, which Guinea officials say at the time was controlled by Mr. Steinmetz, won the rights to mine Simandou after the Guinea government, then led by President Lasana Conte, stripped them from British-American mining giant Rio Tinto PLC. The government said Rio Tinto had failed to develop the resource. Rio Tinto eventually reached a settlement with the Guinean government.\nAfter securing its rights to Simandou, BSGR agreed to a $2.5 billion deal with Brazil’s state mining firm, Vale SA, to split development of the concession .\nA new government took power in late 2010 pledging to stamp out corruption. It stripped BSGR of its mining rights in 2014 over the allegations of paying bribes.\nWrite to Scott Patterson at scott.patterson@wsj.com",
