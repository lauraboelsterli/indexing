    "text": "STAMFORD, Conn., April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Affinion Group Holdings, Inc. (\"Affinion Holdings\" or the \"Company\"), a global leader in loyalty and customer engagement, announced today the financial results for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 (the \"first quarter\" or \"quarter\").\nKey Highlights\nNet revenues were $238.5 million in the first quarter of 2018. Income from operations was $42.4 million in the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in Note (e) of Table 6) was $61.7 million in the first quarter.\n\"2018 is off to a very strong start as we continued our trend of revenue growth in our core businesses, led by double digit increases in our Global Loyalty segment and high single digit growth in our Global Customer Engagement segment in the first quarter,\" said Todd Siegel, the Company's Chief Executive Officer. \"We believe we have a solid foundation for sustained long-term success with our leading capabilities in loyalty and customer engagement solutions, and we continue to add compelling new functionality and pursue exciting new partnerships. Further, the market trends we have seen during the first few months of the year support our 2018 outlook; accordingly, we continue to expect growth in our core businesses in 2018, as compared to 2017 results.\"\nResults Highlights\nNotes: Adjusted EBITDA as referred to above excludes any pro forma impact of acquisitions and other actions. See Table 5 for a complete description of Adjusted EBITDA by segment and the related reconciliations to GAAP measures. See Table 6 for a complete description of Adjusted EBITDA and the related reconciliations to GAAP measures.\nFirst Quarter Net Revenues\nNotes: As of January 1, 2018, the Company has adopted the new Revenue Recognition Standard (\"ASC 606\") using the modified retrospective transition method. For more details regarding ASC 606 and its impact on the Company's financial results, see the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nNet revenues for the first quarter of 2018 decreased 1.1%, from $241.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $238.5 million. The decrease in overall net revenues was primarily due to the expected revenue declines in our non-core Legacy Membership and Package segment and lower revenues in our Insurance segment, partially offset by higher Global Loyalty and Global Customer Engagement revenues. Under the prior revenue recognition guidance, net revenues for the first quarter would have increased 1.7%, from $241.1 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $245.3 million. Net revenues for the three core business segments (Global Loyalty, Global Customer Engagement and Insurance Solutions) for the first quarter of 2018 increased 3.1%, from $202.9 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $209.1 million. Under the prior revenue recognition guidance, net revenues for the three core business segments for the first quarter of 2018 would have increased 6.4%, from $202.9 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $215.9 million. Net revenues for the Legacy Membership and Package segment decreased 23.0%, from $38.2 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $29.4 million.\nFirst Quarter Operating Results\nIncome from operations was $42.4 million as compared to $38.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in Note (e) of Table 6) was $61.7 million as compared to $59.9 million for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of 3.0%. Segment EBITDA (as defined in Note (1) of Table 5) increased $5.1 million primarily as a result of lower marketing and commission expenses and lower operating costs, which were partially offset by lower net revenues and higher general and administrative expenses. Segment EBITDA for the three core business segments increased $6.6 million primarily due to an increase in both Global Loyalty and Global Customer Engagement Segment EBITDA, partially offset by lower Insurance Segment EBITDA. Segment EBITDA for the Legacy Membership and Package segment increased $3.5 million as lower net revenues were more than offset by lower marketing and commissions and lower operating and general and administrative costs. As compared to Segment EBITDA of $54.5 million, first quarter Adjusted EBITDA of $61.7 million reflects the exclusion of, among other items, $2.7 million in costs related primarily to restructuring of certain operations including related severance costs, $0.7 million related to facility exit costs, $0.5 million of stock compensation expense, and $0.3 million in costs related to certain litigation matters.\nSegment Commentary\nGlobal Loyalty net revenues increased by $6.8 million, or 11.9%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 to $63.8 million as compared to $57.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net revenues include a $6.9 million reduction as a result of the January 1, 2018 adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance. Under the prior revenue recognition guidance, net revenues would have increased $13.7 million, or 24.0%. Global Loyalty net revenues increased primarily due to increased growth with existing clients and launches with new clients.\nGlobal Loyalty Segment EBITDA increased by $4.9 million to $25.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $20.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The first quarter of 2017 included a charge of $5.2 million recorded in relation to the remediation of an external gift card inventory cyber theft. The first quarter of 2018 includes a $6.9 million reduction from the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance. Excluding the gift card cyber theft and under the prior revenue recognition guidance, Segment EBITDA would have increased by $6.6 million, or 26.1%, primarily due to the higher net revenue partially offset by higher servicing costs.\nGlobal Customer Engagement net revenues increased by $6.5 million, or 7.3%, to $95.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $89.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net revenues increased $7.5 million from the favorable impact of foreign exchange and decreased $1.0 million on a currency consistent basis.\nGlobal Customer Engagement Segment EBITDA increased by $8.4 million to $21.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $12.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, Global Customer Engagement Segment EBITDA increased from the higher net revenues along with lower operating expenses.\nInsurance Solutions net revenues decreased by $7.1 million, or 12.5%, to $49.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $56.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Insurance Solutions net revenues decreased primarily from a higher cost of insurance, principally from higher claims experience, and the impact of slightly lower supplemental insureds.\nInsurance Solutions Segment EBITDA decreased by $6.7 million to $13.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $20.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Insurance Solutions Segment EBITDA decreased as the impact of lower net revenues was partially offset by slightly lower operating expenses.\nLegacy Membership and Package net revenues decreased by $8.8 million, or 23.0%, to $29.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $38.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Legacy Membership and Package net revenues decreased primarily due to the expected attrition of legacy members and cessation of new marketing campaigns and terminated programs with partners, including large financial institutions, as well as a decline in package revenue primarily due to the impact of lower average package members.\nLegacy Membership and Package Segment EBITDA increased by $3.5 million to $12.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $9.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Legacy Membership and Package Segment EBITDA increased as the impact from lower net revenues was more than offset by lower marketing and commission expense, lower operating costs, and lower general and administrative expenses.\nCorporate costs include certain departmental service costs such as human resources, legal, corporate finance and accounting functions, and unallocated portions of information technology. Expenses, such as professional fees related to debt financing activities and stock compensation costs, are also recorded in corporate. Corporate costs increased by $5.0 million to $17.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $12.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to higher employee related costs and higher professional fees.\nSelected Liquidity Data\nAt March 31, 2018, there was $1,299.1 million of Affinion Group, Inc.'s term loans outstanding (net of discounts) and $573.6 million (net of discounts) outstanding under Affinion Group, Inc.'s senior cash 12.5%/PIK step-up to 15.5% notes due 2022.\nAt March 31, 2018, there were outstanding borrowings of $49.7 million (net of discounts) against Affinion Group, Inc.'s revolving credit facility and $53.0 million of Affinion Group, Inc.'s credit facility was available for borrowing, after giving effect to the issuance of $5.0 million of letters of credit.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Affinion Group, Inc. was in compliance with the restrictive covenants under Affinion Group Inc.'s debt agreements.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, Affinion Holdings' net cash provided by operating activities was $31.1 million and the net loss attributable to Affinion Holdings was $18.8 million.\nAt March 31, 2018, Affinion Holdings had $52.1 million of unrestricted cash on hand.\nConference Call Information\nAffinion Holdings will hold an informational call to discuss the results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. (ET) on Thursday, April 26, 2018.

clients' programs that we support and excludes cash redemptions and revenue generated from programming, platform, administration and other non-transactional services. Gross Transactional Sales Volume per Transaction is calculated by taking the Gross Transactional Sales Volume reported for the period and dividing it by the total transactions for the same period.\n(2)\nAverage Subscribers, Average Supplemental Insureds and Average Legacy Members for the period are all calculated by determining the average subscribers, insureds or members, as applicable, for each month in the period (adding the number of subscribers, insureds or members, as applicable, at the beginning of the month with the number of subscribers, insureds or members, as applicable, at the end of the month and dividing that total by two) and then averaging that result for the period. A subscriber's, insured's or member's, as applicable, account is added or removed in the period in which the subscriber, insured or member, as applicable, has joined or cancelled.\n(3)\nAnnualized Net Revenue per Average Subscriber, Supplemental Insured and Legacy Member are all calculated by taking the revenues from subscribers or insureds, as applicable, for the period and dividing it by the average subscribers or insureds, as applicable, for the period. Quarterly periods are then multiplied by four to annualize this amount for comparative purposes. Upon cancellation of a subscriber or an insured, as applicable, the subscriber's or insured's, as applicable, revenues are no longer recognized in the calculation.\nTABLE 5\nAFFINION GROUP HOLDINGS, INC.\nUNAUDITED OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS\n(In millions)\nNet revenues, Segment EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by operating segment are as follows, including a reconciliation of Affinion Holdings' income from operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 to Affinion Holdings' Segment EBITDA, defined as income from operations before depreciation and amortization, and Adjusted EBITDA as defined in note (e) of Table 6:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\nNet Revenues\nSegment EBITDA (1)\nAdjusted EBITDA (1)\nIncrease\nIncrease\nIncrease\n2018\n2017\n(Decrease)\n2018\n2017\n(Decrease)\n2018\n2017\n(Decrease)\n(in millions)\nGlobal Loyalty\n$\n63.8\n$\n57.0\n$\n6.8\n$\n25.0\n$\n20.1\n$\n4.9\n$\n25.5\n$\n25.0\n$\n0.5\nGlobal Customer Engagement\n95.7\n89.2\n6.5\n21.3\n12.9\n8.4\n23.0\n14.8\n8.2\nInsurance Solutions\n49.6\n56.7\n(7.1)\n13.3\n20.0\n(6.7)\n13.4\n20.2\n(6.8)\nSubtotal\n209.1\n202.9\n6.2\n59.6\n53.0\n6.6\n61.9\n60.0\n1.9\nLegacy Membership and Package\n29.4\n38.2\n(8.8)\n12.5\n9.0\n3.5\n12.6\n10.9\n1.7\nCorporate\n—\n—\n—\n(17.6)\n(12.6)\n(5.0)\n(12.8)\n(11.0)\n(1.8)\nTotal\n$\n238.5\n$\n241.1\n$\n(2.6)\n54.5\n49.4\n5.1\n61.7\n59.9\n1.8\nBusiness optimization expenses and\nrestructuring charges or expenses\n(5.5)\n(3.2)\n(2.3)\nExtraordinary or nonrecurring or\nunusual losses, expenses or charges\n(0.1)\n(6.2)\n6.1\nOther, net\n(1.6)\n(1.1)\n(0.5)\nDepreciation and amortization\n(12.1)\n(11.3)\n(0.8)\n(12.1)\n(11.3)\n(0.8)\nIncome from operations\n$\n42.4\n$\n38.1\n$\n4.3\n$\n42.4\n$\n38.1\n$\n4.3\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018\nGlobal Loyalty\nGlobal Customer Engagement\nInsurance Solutions\nLegacy\nMembership\nand Package\nCorporate\nTotal\n(in millions)\nBusiness optimization expenses and\nrestructuring charges or expenses\n$\n0.7\n$\n1.7\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n3.1\n$\n5.5\nExtraordinary or nonrecurring or unusual\nlosses, expenses or charges\n(0.2)\n—\n0.1\n0.1\n0.1\n0.1\nOther, net\n—\n—\n—\n—\n1.6\n1.6\nTotal\n$\n0.5\n$\n1.7\n$\n0.1\n$\n0.1\n$\n4.8\n$\n7.2\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2017\nGlobal Loyalty\nGlobal Customer Engagement\nInsurance Solutions\nLegacy\nMembership\nand Package\nCorporate\nTotal\n(in millions)\nBusiness optimization expenses and\nrestructuring charges or expenses\n$\n—\n$\n1.6\n$\n0.1\n$\n0.8\n$\n0.7\n$\n3.2\nExtraordinary or nonrecurring or unusual\nlosses, expenses or charges\n5.2\n0.1\n—\n1.0\n(0.1)\n6.2\nOther, net\n(0.3)\n0.2\n0.1\n0.1\n1.0\n1.1\nTotal\n$\n4.9\n$\n1.9\n$\n0.2\n$\n1.9\n$\n1.6\n$\n10.5\n(1)\nSegment EBITDA consists of income from operations before depreciation and amortization. Segment EBITDA is the measure management uses to evaluate segment performance, and we present Segment EBITDA to enhance your understanding of our operating performance. We use Segment EBITDA as one criterion for evaluating our performance relative to that of our peers. We believe that Segment EBITDA is an operating performance measure, and not a liquidity measure, that provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies. However, Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider Segment EBITDA as an alternative to operating or net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity. For a reconciliation of Affinion Holdings' consolidated net income (loss) attributable for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018 and three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 to Affinion Holdings' Segment EBITDA, see Table 6.\nWe believe that Adjusted EBITDA for each segment provides supplemental information useful to investors as it is frequently used by the financial community to analyze performance period to period, to analyze a company's ability to service its debt and to facilitate comparisons among companies. We believe Adjusted EBITDA also provides additional supplemental information to compare results among our segments. However, Adjusted EBITDA by segment is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and Adjusted EBITDA by segment may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA by segment as an alternative to operating or net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity. For a discussion of the definition of Adjusted EBITDA and the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated net income (loss) attributable to Affinion Group Holdings, Inc., see Table 6.\nTABLE 6\nAFFINION GROUP HOLDINGS, INC.\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nTO GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES (UNAUDITED)\n(In millions)\nSet forth below is a reconciliation of Affinion Holdings' consolidated net income (loss) attributable to Affinion Group Holdings, Inc. for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018 and the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 to Affinion Holdings' Adjusted EBITDA.\nFor the Twelve\nFor the Three Months\nMonths Ended\nEnded March 31,\nMarch 31, 2018 (a)\n2018\n2017\n(in millions)\nNet income (loss) attributable to Affinion Group Holdings, Inc.\n$\n(51.8)\n$\n(18.8)\n$\n7.8\nInterest expense, net\n217.9\n59.2\n27.5\nIncome tax provision (benefit)\n(19.0)\n1.3\n2.4\nNon-controlling interest\n1.0\n0.5\n0.3\nOther expense, net\n0.5\n0.2\n0.1\nGain on extinguishment of debt\n(3.5)\n—\n—\nDepreciation and amortization\n47.6\n12.1\n11.3\nBusiness optimization expenses and restructuring charges or expenses (b)\n18.5\n5.5\n3.2\nExtraordinary or nonrecurring or unusual losses, expenses or charges (c)\n21.8\n0.1\n6.2\nOther, net (d)\n4.0\n1.6\n1.1\nAdjusted EBITDA, excluding pro forma adjustments (e) (f)\n237.0\n$\n61.7\n$\n59.9\nEffect of the pro forma adjustments (g)\n—\nAdjusted EBITDA, including pro forma adjustments (h)\n$\n237.0\n(a)\nRepresents consolidated financial data for the year ended December 31, 2017, minus consolidated financial data for the three months ended March 31, 2017, plus consolidated financial data for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\n(b)\nRepresents the elimination of the effect of business optimization expenses and restructuring charges or expenses.\n(c)\nRepresents the elimination of extraordinary or nonrecurring or unusual losses, expenses or charges.\n(d)\nPrimarily represents the elimination of (i) net changes in certain reserves, (ii) share-based compensation expense and (iii) foreign currency gains and losses related to unusual, non-recurring intercompany transactions.\n(e)\nAdjusted EBITDA consists of income from operations before depreciation and amortization further adjusted to exclude non-cash and unusual items and other adjustments permitted in our debt agreements to test the permissibility of certain types of transactions, including debt incurrence. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an operating performance measure, and not a liquidity measure, that provides investors and analysts with a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures, capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies. We use Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance and as a basis for determining payment of bonuses under our annual incentive plan. We present Adjusted EBITDA to enhance your understanding of our operating performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. You should not consider Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to operating or net income determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP or as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or as an indicator of cash flows, or as a measure of liquidity.\n(f)\nAdjusted EBITDA, excluding pro forma adjustments, does not give pro forma effect to the projected annualized benefits of restructurings and other cost savings initiatives.
