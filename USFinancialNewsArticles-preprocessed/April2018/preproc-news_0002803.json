    "text": "  3:07 p.m. ET Share \nLauer also selling 25-acre Hamptons estate, whose price has been cut to $12.75 million from $18 million, according to Corcoran Group Getty Images Katherine Clark \nMatt Lauer has put his Manhattan apartment on the market for $7.35 million. \nThe listing comes four months after he was fired from NBC’s CMCSA, -2.27% “Today” show over allegations of sexual misconduct. \nLauer bought the four-bedroom, 4½-bathroom co-op for $5.882 million in 2004, according to property records. Located on East 64th Street, less than three blocks from Central Park, the sprawling apartment features a long living room with three large windows, custom bookshelves and a fireplace, according to the listing. There’s also a corner library, a powder room with midnight blue Venetian plaster walls, a dining room and an entire bedroom wing. The master bedroom has two large dressing rooms, two marble master bathrooms and a sitting room, according to the listing. \nReal-estate agents Alexa Lambert, Julie Soffen and Marc Achilles of Stribling & Associates are representing Lauer. They declined to comment on the listing, which appears on real estate listings website StreetEasy. \nLauer, 60, co-anchored “Today” for more than 20 years. In November, he released a statement apologizing for the alleged sexual misconduct but disputed some accounts of his behavior.",
