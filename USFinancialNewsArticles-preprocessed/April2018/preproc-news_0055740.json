    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Klondex Mines Ltd. (TSX:KDX) (NYSE American:KLDX) (“Klondex” or the “Company”) reported today its preliminary operating results for the first quarter of 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nAnnounced proposed acquisition of Klondex by Hecla Mining Company (Hecla) for US$462 million Mined 49,873 gold equivalent ounces (“GEOs”) Produced 43,525 GEOs Mined and production results in-line with Company expectations Sold 42,541 GEOs\nProposed Transaction with Hecla:\nOn March 19, 2018, the Company announced that Hecla will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Klondex through a plan of arrangement. Hecla will acquire Klondex for consideration of US$462 million comprised of cash and shares of Hecla common stock. Klondex shareholders will receive US$2.47 per share in cash or shares of Hecla which represents a 59% premium to Klondex's 30-day volume-weighted average price at March 16, 2018 and a premium of approximately 72% based on the closing price on March 16, 2018. Klondex's Canadian assets will be spun out to its existing shareholders. Klondex shareholders will receive, for each Klondex share, 0.125 of a common share of a newly formed company which will own Klondex's Canadian assets.\nThe closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions including shareholder and regulatory approvals. Additional details regarding the transaction will be available in the preliminary proxy statement that is expected to be filed with regulatory agencies in May. Pending receipt of all required approvals, the Company anticipates that the transaction will be completed in the second quarter of 2018.\nNevada Operations:\nThe Company mined and produced a total of 47,499 and 41,415 GEOs, respectively, at its Nevada operations during the first quarter of 2018. Total GEOs produced for the first quarter included approximately 3,700 ounces from the Hollister ore stockpile that were sold to and processed by a third party.\nCanada Operations:\nThe Company mined and produced a total of 2,374 and 2,111 GEOs, respectively, at its Canada operations during the first quarter of 2018. These ounces were mined from areas that were developed prior to the Company's decision to place the True North operation on care and maintenance in early January of 2018. Consistent with management plans, no ounces were processed from tailings at True North during the first quarter of 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Operating Results:\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 Consolidated Nevada Total Canada Total Total Ore tons mined 92,303 19,301 111,604 Gold equivalent grade mined (opt) (1) 0.51 0.12 0.45 Gold equivalent ounces mined (1) 47,499 2,374 49,873 Ore tons milled 89,772 19,390 109,162 Gold equivalent grade milled (opt) (1) 0.54 0.12 0.40 Gold equivalent ounces produced (1) 41,415 2,111 43,525 Gold equivalent ounces sold (1) 37,370 5,171 42,541 GEO Ratio (1) 80.4 79.6 80.4 (1) Gold equivalent ounces (\"GEO\") and grades are computed as the applicable gold ounces/grade plus the silver ounces/grade divided by a GEO ratio.
