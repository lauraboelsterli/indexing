    "text": "SAN DIEGO, April 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Turtle Beach Corporation (NASDAQ: HEAR), a leading gaming headset and audio accessory company, is announcing that its board of directors have approved a 1-for-4 reverse split of its common stock, effective as of the close of business today.\nAs a result of the reverse stock split, every four shares of the Company's common stock will be converted into one share of common stock, reducing the number of issued and outstanding shares from approximately 49.4 million to approximately 12.4 million.
