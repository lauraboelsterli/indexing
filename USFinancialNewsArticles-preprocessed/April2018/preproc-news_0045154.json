    "text": "Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth and her newborn daughter, Maile, made history on Thursday â€” again.\nDuckworth, who earlier this month became the first U.S. senator to give birth while in office, brought baby Maile with her to vote on the Senate floor, just a day after rules were changed to allow Duckworth and other senators to bring children younger than 1 with them to vote. Duckworth suggested the policy, arguing that Senate attendance requirements would be at odds with the difficulties of caring for a newborn.\nðŸš¨ðŸš¨ SENATE BABY ALERT ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ pic.twitter.com/3VeYjudp8L\nâ€” Ryan Struyk (@ryanstruyk) April 19, 2018\nAhead of the historic appearance, Duckworth tweeted a photo of the outfit sheâ€™d laid out for her daughter, poking fun at a separate controversy over the Senate dress code .\nI may have to vote today, so Maileâ€™s outfit is prepped. I made sure she has a jacket so she doesnâ€™t violate the Senate floor dress code (which requires blazers). Iâ€™m not sure what the policy is on duckling onesies, but I think weâ€™re ready pic.twitter.com/SsNHEuSVnY\nâ€” Tammy Duckworth (@SenDuckworth) April 19, 2018\nDuckworth made her return to the U.S. Capitol just nine days after giving birth. She voted against President Donald Trumpâ€™s nominee for NASA administrator, Jim Bridenstine. Despite her vote, Bridenstine was confirmed by a vote of 50 to 47 .",
