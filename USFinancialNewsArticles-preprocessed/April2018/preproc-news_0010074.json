    "text": "Allen Crabbe’s back-to-back 3-pointers snapped a late tie Thursday night as the Brooklyn Nets notched a 119-111 win over the Milwaukee Bucks at BMO Harris Bradley Center in Milwaukee.\nBrooklyn did much of its damage from the arc, connecting on 19-of-39 3-pointers. Crabbe sank five treys and scored 25 points, while D’Angelo Russell bagged 22 points and five assists, adding four 3-pointers.\nJoe Harris contributed 17, reserve Caris LeVert hit for 13 and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson chipped in 14 points, 11 rebounds and five assists.\nKhris Middleton pumped in a game-high 31 points for the Bucks, while Eric Bledsoe added 18. Giannis Antetokounmpo contributed 19 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists, although he made only 7-of-21 shots. Jabari Parker came off the bench to score 13 points and John Henson netted 12.\nTied at 105, Brooklyn took the lead for good when Crabbe drilled a three with 2:43 left. Two possessions later, Crabbe canned another three for a 111-105 margin with 1:18 remaining, and the Nets protected their lead by going 8-for-8 at the foul line in the final 33.3 seconds.\nBrooklyn controlled most of the first half against a team that clinched its Eastern Conference playoff spot Wednesday night with Detroit’s home loss to Philadelphia.\nThe Nets established a 12-5 lead less than four minutes into the game on a running hook by Allen Crabbe and took a 30-24 advantage to the second quarter when Hollis-Jefferson made two foul shots with 33.9 seconds left.\nMilwaukee surged to start the second and grabbed a brief 36-35 edge, but Brooklyn went on a 17-7 run, upping its lead to nine on a Quincy Acy 3-pointer with 1:21 remaining in the half. Bledsoe’s jumper in the last 30 seconds left the Nets with a 52-45 halftime lead.\nThe Bucks made their move in the third quarter, wiping out a 10-point deficit and taking a 75-71 advantage when Bledsoe drained a 3-ball with 2:23 left. Brooklyn rallied, however, and earned an 83-81 edge going to the fourth quarter.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
