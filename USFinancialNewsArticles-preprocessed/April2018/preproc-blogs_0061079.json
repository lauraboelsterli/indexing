Photo: AP\nNorfolk Southern Corp. has ramped up its use of data analytics to boost operations as well as back-office functions over the past year, said Chief Financial Officer Cynthia Earhart.\nMs. Earhart, previously the company’s chief information officer, said she has introduced a new method of revenue forecasting that incorporates more macroeconomic indicators. And diving into a deep pool of data about how the company’s trains are running is helping her decide how to allocate funds in areas such as maintenance, she said.\nThe revenue-forecasting system, a mix of new technologies and processes, was developed internally and uses macroeconomic data to be more predictive, Ms. Earhart said.\nPreviously, the process of revenue forecasting was a more “bottom-up” process that focused on individual customer’s needs, said Ms. Earhart, a more than 30-year veteran of the railroad.\n“It takes some time to train someone to be on a locomotive, you need to have visibility nine months ahead of time” to make hiring decisions, she said. “If you think about revenue forecasting, that’s where everything starts. That’s going to drive a lot of things.”\nA government mandate has forced the railway industry to introduce new technology to boost safety. Complying has yielded data that Norfolk Southern has put to use, Ms. Earhart said.\nThe Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 called for passenger and freight railroads to install “positive train control” technologies–systems to automatically stop a train to prevent accidents– by 2015, according to the Association of American Railroads. The deadline was later moved to the end of this year, and further extensions are available through 2020 to allow for testing.\nMs. Earhart said Norfolk Southern locomotives now have roughly 100 sensors sending out data in real time. That stream of information is not only helping to comply with the safety mandate but also giving rise to applications that can help operations run smoothly and even help Ms. Earhart decide where to spend the hundreds of millions of dollars allocated annually for track maintenance, for example.\n“We call it the ‘data lake.’ We’re fairly new to it. It’s been less than a year, ” she said. “We can predict component failure ahead of time.”\nShe said her team is still developing the various uses of all the information being collected. “It’s so much data and it can get overwhelming,” she said. “First you have to figure out how to store it, no matter what kind of data it is, and then figure out a way to mesh the data together to produce something you can use.”\nShare this: BIG DATA Previous The Weekend Reader: Three Must-Reads Content from our sponsor Deloitte CFO insight and analysis written and compiled by Deloitte SEC Issues Cybersecurity Guidance In response to the increase in digital technology, and the severity and frequency of cybersecurity threats and incidents, the SEC issued interpretive guidance. The guidance does not establish new disclosure obligations but rather presents the SEC’s views on how its existing rules should be interpreted in connection with cybersecurity threats and incidents. It also emphasized that registrants are responsible for disclosing appropriate information to keep investors informed and must balance the need for timely disclosure with the level of detail they can provide about such incidents.\nPlease note: The Wall Street Journal News Department was not involved in the creation of the content above.
