It ranks among the world's top public restaurant brands with a global enterprise of more than 14,800 stores in over 85 markets. Domino's had global retail sales of over $12.2 billion in 2017, with more than $5.9 billion in the U.S. and more than $6.3 billion internationally. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Domino's had global retail sales of nearly $4.0 billion, with nearly $1.9 billion in the U.S. and over $2.1 billion internationally. Its system is comprised of independent franchise owners who accounted for over 97% of Domino's stores as of the fourth quarter of 2017. Emphasis on technology innovation helped Domino's achieve more than half of all global retail sales in 2017 from digital channels, primarily online ordering and mobile applications. In the U.S., Domino's generates over 60% of sales via digital channels and has produced several innovative ordering platforms, including Google Home, Facebook Messenger, Apple Watch, Amazon Echo, Twitter and text message using a pizza emoji. In late 2017, as part of an industry-first collaboration with Ford Motor Company, Domino's began a meaningful test of delivery using self-driving vehicles.\nOrder – dominos.com\nAnyWare Ordering – anyware.dominos.com\nCompany Info – biz.dominos.com\nTwitter – twitter.com/dominos\nFacebook – facebook.com/dominos\nInstagram – instagram.com/dominos\nYouTube – youtube.com/dominos\nPlease visit our Investor Relations website at biz.dominos.com to view news, announcements, earnings releases and conference webcasts.\nView original content with multimedia: releases/dominos-pizza-announces-q1-2018-earnings-webcast-300630388.html\nSOURCE Domino's Pizza",
