    "text": "* Q1 lfl sales up 2 pct vs 2.6 pct consensus\n* Company stands by full-year target\n* Shares down 5 pct to lowest since 2015 (Adds analyst comment, share reaction, bullet points)\nBy Martinne Geller\nLONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - Reckitt Benckiser lagged other consumer good makers in the first quarter as further falls in Scholl footcare and lower prices hit the British company’s sales growth.\nBernstein analysts said Reckitt’s like-for-like sales growth was “bottom of class” of the five European food and packaged goods companies that have reported quarterly sales so far, and it shares fell 5 percent on Friday to their lowest level since August 2015.\nNestle, Procter & Gamble and Unilever also saw very little first-quarter pricing growth as packaged goods makers face pressure from retailers fighting off drug store chains and Amazon.com.\nReckitt, which makes Durex condoms, Lysol disinfectant and Mucinex cold medicine said like-for-like sales rose 2 percent in the first quarter, below analysts’ average estimate of 2.6 percent, according to a company-supplied consensus.\nVolume was up 3 percent, implying that overall pricing had a negative 1 percent impact, which was worse than what Nestle and Unilever experienced.\n“This year’s earlier Easter doesn’t seem to have helped Q1’s performance – or if it has, the underlying picture is pretty grim, in our view,” analysts at RBC Capital markets said.\nWEAK HEALTH Reckitt’s health-related products, which make up 62 percent of the business, saw like-for-like sales up just 1 percent, held back by a 2 percentage point drag from Scholl, which has struggled for two years in the wake of a failed product launch.\n“We are addressing our performance in Scholl through acceleration of our pipeline, penetration improvement programmes and streamlining our range,” Reckitt said in a statement.\nSales in the smaller home and hygiene business rose 4 percent.\nReported sales were 3.11 billion pounds ($4.37 billion), just shy of the 3.12 billion in analysts’ consensus.\nThe company said it still expects 2018 revenue up 13 to 14 percent, with like-for-like sales up 2 to 3 percent. That would be an improvement from flat sales growth in 2017, due to a spate of issues from a product failure to a cyber attack.
