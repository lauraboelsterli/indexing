    "text": "H&P’s U.S. Land contracted rig count increased by approximately 4% from 204 rigs at December 31, 2017 to 213 rigs at March 31, 2018 Quarterly U.S. Land average rig revenue per day increased by over $500 per day or over 2% sequentially Upgraded 30 FlexRigs® to super-spec (1) capacity since the beginning of fiscal 2018 (October 1, 2017) resulting in 183 super-spec rigs in our fleet today H&P has been rated 1 st in total customer satisfaction for 10 years in a row by EnergyPoint Research (2)\nTULSA, Okla., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Helmerich & Payne, Inc. (NYSE:HP) reported a net loss of $12 million or $(0.12) per diluted share from operating revenues of $577 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The net loss per diluted share includes $(0.07) of after-tax losses comprised of select items(3). Net cash provided by operating activities was $125 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nPresident and CEO John Lindsay commented, “Second quarter operational results were strong and our team continued to execute in superb fashion in this steadily improving environment. Higher crude oil prices bolstered increases in the U.S. rig count which in turn supported rig pricing improvements during the quarter.\n“The demand for super-spec rigs continues to persist as the industry’s super-spec fleet remains nearly 100% utilized. H&P leads the way with more than 40% of the super-spec market share in U.S. Land. We also have approximately 50% of the industry’s idle rig capacity not already at super-spec capability that can be readily upgraded to those specifications in the current pricing environment. Our robust financial position and the composition of our fleet continues to drive our ability to respond to current and future FlexRig demand. Given the tightening market conditions for FlexRigs and the value proposition we provide for customers, we expect increases in average dayrates for our rigs in the U.S. Land spot market to accelerate during the next few months.\n“The Permian is the most active basin in the U.S. and has been the epicenter of the industry’s recovery. H&P has 107 rigs operating in the region, providing us with a leading market share of more than 20% and we expect our rig count to continue to grow throughout the next several months. Our attention to work-force staffing during the last downturn continues to enable us to effectively manage tightening labor market conditions in the Permian.\n“The strengthening of crude oil prices has also been encouraging for our international and offshore businesses as we have seen a rise in the number of inquiries and opportunities in these segments.\n“Our subsidiaries, MOTIVE® Drilling Technologies, Inc. and MagVAR, remain at the technological forefront of providing value-added services in improving overall well economics for our customers. These businesses are growing activity at impressive rates as the importance of wellbore quality and placement is increasing, while at the same time longer laterals and tighter well spacing are becoming more and more prevalent. These technology offerings, combined with our digital FlexRig platform, continue to provide significant value for our customers going forward.\n“Our relentless focus on our customers was recognized by EnergyPoint Research during the second quarter. For 10 years in a row, H&P has received the top customer satisfaction ranking in the industry. This is driven by our commitment to service, but also our ability to deliver stellar performance with our Family of Solutions TM .”\nOperating Segment Results for the Second Quarter of Fiscal 2018\nU.S. Land Operations:\nSegment operating income increased by $2.3 million to $27.1 million sequentially. Positive operating results continue to be supported by sequential increases in both quarterly revenue days and average rig revenue per day. The segment’s depreciation expense for the quarter includes non-cash charges of $7.1 million for abandonments of used drilling rig components related to rig upgrades, compared to similar non-cash charges of $7.2 million during the first fiscal quarter of 2018.\nThe number of quarterly revenue days increased sequentially by approximately 2%. Adjusted average rig revenue per day increased by $544 to $22,711(4) as pricing continued to improve throughout the quarter. The average rig expense per day increased sequentially by $540 to $14,086. The corresponding adjusted average rig margin per day was roughly flat at $8,625(4) for the second fiscal quarter.\nOffshore Operations:\nSegment operating income decreased by $3.3 million to $5.4 million sequentially. The number of quarterly revenue days on H&P-owned platform rigs decreased sequentially by approximately 2%, and the average rig margin per day decreased sequentially by $2,871 to $9,504 primarily due to unfavorable adjustments to self-insurance expenses. Management contracts on customer-owned platform rigs contributed approximately $5.1 million to the segment’s operating income, compared to approximately $6.5 million during the prior quarter.\nInternational Land Operations:\nThe segment had an operating loss this quarter as compared to operating income during the previous quarter. The $4.2 million sequential decrease in operating income was primarily attributable to favorable adjustments that benefited the prior quarter (ended December 31, 2017). Revenue days decreased during the quarter by 4% to 1,530. The average rig margin per day decreased by $2,818 to $8,533.\nOperational Outlook for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2018\nU.S. Land Operations:\nQuarterly revenue days expected to increase by approximately 7% sequentially Average rig revenue per day expected to be roughly $23,000 (excluding any impact from early termination revenue, including impact of labor cost adjustments) Average rig expense per day expected to be roughly $14,400 (including impact of labor cost adjustments)\nOffshore Operations:\nQuarterly revenue days expected to increase by approximately 15% sequentially Average rig margin per day expected to be approximately $10,500 Management contracts expected to generate approximately $4 to $5 million in operating income\nInternational Land Operations:\nQuarterly revenue days expected to increase by approximately 5% to 10% sequentially Average rig margin per day expected to be roughly $9,000\nOther Estimates for Fiscal 2018\nCapital expenditures are still expected to be in the range of approximately $400 to $450 million. The estimate for general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2018 is now approximately $190 million. Depreciation is now expected to be approximately $585 million, inclusive of abandonment charges estimated at roughly $35 million.\nOther Highlights\nUpgraded 30 FlexRigs to super-spec (1) capacity since the beginning of fiscal 2018 (October 1, 2017) resulting in 183 super-spec rigs in our fleet today. On March 5, 2018, MOTIVE, a wholly-owned subsidiary of H&P, announced that the company had set a new record of five million feet of directional drilling using its automated bit guidance system. Recently, Rig 608, a super-spec FlexRig3, working for an operator in the Utica Shale, drilled a total measured depth well of approximately 30,130 feet with an extended reach lateral measuring approximately 19,300 feet. This was completed in approximately 20 days (from spud to release). On March 7, 2018, Directors of the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share on the Company’s common stock payable June 1, 2018 (as filed on Form 8‑K at the time of the declaration).\nSelect Items Included in Net Income (or Loss) per Diluted Share\nSecond Quarter of Fiscal 2018 net loss of $(0.12) per diluted share included $(0.07) in after-tax losses comprised of the following:\n$0.01 of incremental income tax adjustments related to the recognition of the new corporate tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (5) in calculating the Company’s new deferred income tax liability $0.03 of after-tax income from long-term contract early termination compensation from customers $0.04 of after-tax gains related to the sale of used drilling equipment $(0.09) of after-tax losses from discontinued operations related to adjustments resulting from currency devaluation $(0.06) of after-tax losses from abandonment charges related to the decommissioning of used drilling equipment\nFirst Quarter of Fiscal 2018 net income of $4.55 per diluted share included $4.57 in after-tax gains comprised of the following:\n$4.55 of income tax adjustments related to the recognition of the new corporate tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in calculating the Company’s new deferred income tax liability $0.03 of after-tax income from long-term contract early termination compensation from customers $0.04 of after-tax gains related to the sale of used drilling equipment $(0.05) of after-tax losses from abandonment charges related to the decommissioning of used drilling equipment\nAbout Helmerich & Payne, Inc.\nHelmerich & Payne, Inc. is primarily a contract drilling company.

The Company considers segment operating income to be an important supplemental measure of operating performance for presenting trends in the Company’s core businesses. This measure is used by the Company to facilitate period-to-period comparisons in operating performance of the Company’s reportable segments in the aggregate by eliminating items that affect comparability between periods. The Company believes that segment operating income is useful to investors because it provides a means to evaluate the operating performance of the segments and the Company on an ongoing basis using criteria that are used by our internal decision makers. Additionally, it highlights operating trends and aids analytical comparisons. However, segment operating income has limitations and should not be used as an alternative to operating income or loss, a performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as it excludes certain costs that may affect the Company’s operating performance in future periods.\nThe following table reconciles operating income per the information above to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes as reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations (in thousands).\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended March 31 December 31 March 31 March 31 2018 2017 2017 2018 2017 Operating income (loss) U.S. Land $ 27,075 $ 24,745 $ (51,850 ) $ 51,820 $ (82,738 ) Offshore 5,449 8,725 5,912 14,174 12,696 International Land (695 ) 3,534 (10,977 ) 2,839 (10,152 ) Other (7,015 ) (7,317 ) (1,134 ) (14,332 ) (3,183 ) Segment operating income (loss) $ 24,814 $ 29,687 $ (58,049 ) $ 54,501 $ (83,377 ) Corporate general and administrative (28,267 ) (28,549 ) (19,124 ) (56,816 ) (40,159 ) Other depreciation (3,418 ) (3,545 ) (3,822 ) (6,963 ) (7,899 ) Inter-segment elimination 363 362 434 725 868 Income from asset sales 5,255 5,565 14,889 10,820 15,731 Operating income (loss) $ (1,253 ) $ 3,520 $ (65,672 ) $ 2,267 $ (114,836 ) Other income (expense): Interest and dividend income 1,847 1,724 1,338 3,571 2,328 Interest expense (6,028 ) (5,773 ) (6,084 ) (11,801 ) (11,139 ) Other (121 ) 530 174 409 561 Total other income (expense) (4,302 ) (3,519 ) (4,572 ) (7,821 ) (8,250 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes $ (5,555 ) $ 1 $ (70,244 ) $ (5,554 ) $ (123,086 )\nSUPPLEMENTARY STATISTICAL INFORMATION\nThe tables and information that follow are additional statistical information that may also help provide further clarity and insight into the operations of the Company.\nSELECTED STATISTICAL & OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS (Used to determine adjusted per revenue day statistics, which is a non-GAAP measure) Three Months Ended March 31 December 31 2018 2017 (in dollars per revenue day) U.S. Land Operations Early contract termination revenues $ 217 $ 233 Total impact per revenue day: $ 217 $ 233\nU.S. LAND RIG COUNTS & MARKETABLE FLEET STATISTICS April 26 March 31 December 31 Q2FY18 2018 2018 2017 Average U.S. Land Operations Term Contract Rigs 128 125 102 118.5 Spot Contract Rigs 88 88 102 88.9 Total Contracted Rigs 216 213 204 207.4 Idle or Other Rigs 134 137 146 142.6 Total Marketable Fleet 350 350 350 350.0\nH&P GLOBAL FLEET UNDER TERM CONTRACT STATISTICS Number of Rigs Already Under Long-Term Contracts (1) (Estimated Quarterly Average — as of 04/26/18) Q3 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q1 Segment FY18 FY18 FY19 FY19 FY19 FY19 FY20 U.S. Land Operations 124.5 103.1 89.1 51.2 38.8 30.4 21.4 International Land Operations 10.0 10.0 10.0 10.0 10.0 10.0 9.0 Offshore Operations 1.9 0.3 — — — — — Total 136.4 113.4 99.1 61.2 48.8 40.4 30.4",
