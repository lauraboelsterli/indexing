    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif., April 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- eBay Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY), a global commerce leader, delivered revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 of $2.6 billion, increasing 12% on an as-reported basis and 7% on a foreign exchange (FX) neutral basis, primarily driven by gross merchandise volume (GMV) of $23.6 billion, up 13% on an as-reported basis and 7% on an FX-Neutral basis.\nDuring the quarter, eBay delivered GAAP net income from continuing operations of $407 million, or $0.40 per diluted share and Non-GAAP net income from continuing operations of $548 million, or $0.53 per diluted share. The company generated $495 million of operating cash flow and $337 million of free cash flow from continuing operations while also repurchasing $1.0 billion of its common stock in the quarter.\n\"In Q1 we drove good growth and made further progress with our multi-year effort to transform our customer experience and sharpen the eBay brand,\" said Devin Wenig, President and CEO of eBay Inc.\nIn the first quarter, eBay grew active buyers by 4% across its platforms, for a total of 171 million global active buyers. Underlying total eBay Inc. performance, the Marketplace platforms delivered $2.1 billion of revenue and $22.5 billion of GMV. Marketplace revenue growth was 11% on an as-reported basis and 7% on an FX-Neutral basis and GMV was up 13% on an as-reported basis and 7% on an FX-Neutral basis, aided by continued expansion of new user experiences. StubHub drove revenue of $232 million, up 9% on both an as-reported basis and FX-Neutral basis, and GMV of $1.0 billion, up 14% on an as-reported basis and 13% on an FX-Neutral basis, driven by a robust sports landscape, including a record Super Bowl, and strong international growth. Classifieds platforms delivered another quarter of double-digit growth with revenue of $246 million, up 24% on an as-reported basis and 10% on an FX-Neutral basis, driven primarily by strength in Germany.\nThe company continues to innovate and transform the shopping experience for its customers. In the first quarter, eBay launched a new product based commerce experience to a subset of its users, leveraging its structured data foundation. As part of its effort to build immersive and engaging buying and selling experiences, eBay also introduced a new augmented reality shipping tool to help customers find the right box to ship an item that is as easy as holding up a mobile phone. eBay's development teams are using artificial intelligence (AI) to sharpen the overall search experience, leveraging data and AI to improve recall and relevance on the eBay platform. During the quarter, eBay also appointed Jan Pedersen, a proven leader in AI, as Chief Scientist, Artificial Intelligence.\neBay recently released its 2017 Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Report, which highlights momentum in the company's D&I programs and partnerships across its workforce, workplace and marketplace, along with changes in eBay's people data. The report also discloses the results of eBay's second annual global study of gender pay equity, which found that women earn 100% of what men earn in terms of total compensation in the U.S., and women earn 100.1% of what men earn in terms of total compensation globally.\nDuring the quarter, eBay announced that it will acquire Giosis' Japan business, including the Qoo10.jp platform. This acquisition will significantly expand eBay's footprint in Japan, one of the largest e-commerce markets in the world, and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.\nFirst Quarter Financial Highlights (presented in millions, except per share data and percentages)\nFirst Quarter\n2018\n2017\nChange\neBay Inc.\nNet revenues\n$2,580\n$2,303\n$277\n12%\nGAAP - Continuing Operations\nIncome from continuing operations\n$407\n$1,035\n$(628)\n(61)%\nEarnings per diluted share from continuing operations\n$0.40\n$0.94\n$(0.54)\n(58)%\nNon-GAAP - Continuing Operations\nNet income\n$548\n$538\n$10\n2%\nEarnings per diluted share\n$0.53\n$0.49\n$0.04\n9%\nOther Selected Financial and Operational Results\nOperating margin — GAAP operating margin decreased to 22.5% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 23.7% for the same period last year.

Such guidance is based on information available on the date of this press release, and the company assumes no obligation to update it.\nThe company's future performance involves risks and uncertainties, and the company's actual results could differ materially from the information below and elsewhere in this press release. Some of the factors that could affect the company's operating results are set forth under the caption \"Forward-Looking Statements\" above in this press release. More information about factors that could affect the company's operating results is included under the captions \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, copies of which may be obtained by visiting eBay's investor relations website at https://investors.ebayinc.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov .\neBay Inc.\nThree Months Ending\nJune 30, 2018\n(In billions,\nGAAP\nNon-GAAP (a)\nNet Revenue\n$2.64 - $2.68\n$2.64 - $2.68\nDiluted EPS from continuing operations\n$0.33 - $0.37\n$0.50 - $0.52\nTwelve Months Ending\nDecember 31, 2018\n(In billions,\nGAAP\nNon-GAAP (b)\nNet Revenue\n$10.9 - $11.1\n$10.9 - $11.1\nDiluted EPS from continuing operations\n$1.65 - $1.75\n$2.25 - $2.30\n(a) Estimated non-GAAP amounts above for the three months ending June 30, 2018 reflect adjustments that exclude the estimated amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately $10 - $15 million and estimated stock-based compensation expense and associated employer payroll tax expense of approximately $160 - $170 million, as well as the related income tax impact. Estimated non-GAAP amounts above for the three months ending June 30, 2018, reflect adjustments that exclude tax impacts of the company's legal entity realignment, which are not reduced by the effects of the global minimum tax associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, of approximately $30 - $40 million.\n(b) Estimated non-GAAP amounts above for the twelve months ending December 31, 2018 reflect adjustments that exclude the estimated amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately $40 - $50 million and estimated stock-based compensation expense and associated employer payroll tax expense of approximately $560 - $580 million, as well as the related income tax impact. Estimated non-GAAP amounts above for the twelve months ending December 31, 2018, reflect adjustments that exclude tax impacts of the company's legal entity realignment, which are not reduced by the effects of the global minimum tax associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, of approximately $130 - $150 million.\neBay Inc.\nNon-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance\nTo supplement the company's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate, and free cash flow. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented on a continuing operations basis.\nThese non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the company's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should only be used to evaluate the company's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.\nReconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release can be found in the tables included in this press release.\nThese non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses, or net purchases of property and equipment, as the case may be, that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because the company has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting.\nFor its internal budgeting process, and as discussed further below, the company's management uses financial measures that do not include stock-based compensation expense, employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation, amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, amortization of deferred tax assets associated with the realignment of its legal structure and related foreign exchange effects, significant gains or losses from the disposal/acquisition of a business, certain gains and losses on investments, restructuring-related charges and the income taxes associated with the foregoing. In addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, the company's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing the financial results of the company.\nThe company excludes the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP effective tax rate:\nStock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes. This expense consists of expenses for stock options, restricted stock and employee stock purchases. The company excludes stock-based compensation expense from its non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses that management does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. The related employer payroll taxes are dependent on the company's stock price and the timing and size of exercises by employees of their stock options and the vesting of their restricted stock, over which management has limited to no control, and as such management does not believe it correlates to the company's operation of the business.\nAmortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, certain amortization of deferred tax assets and related foreign exchange effects, significant gains or losses and transaction expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and certain gains or losses on investments. The company incurs amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions and may incur significant gains or losses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and therefore excludes these amounts from its non-GAAP measures. The company also excludes certain gains and losses on investments. The company excludes the non-cash amortization of deferred tax assets associated with the realignment of its legal structure, which is not reduced by the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and related foreign exchange effects. The company excludes these items because management does not believe they correlate to the ongoing operating results of the company's business.\nRestructuring. These charges consist of expenses for employee severance and other exit and disposal costs. The company excludes significant restructuring charges primarily because management does not believe they are reflective of ongoing operating results.\nOther certain significant gains, losses, or charges that are not indicative of the company's core operating results. These are significant gains, losses, or charges during a period that are the result of isolated events or transactions which have not occurred frequently in the past and are not expected to occur regularly or be repeated in the future. The company excludes these amounts from its results primarily because management does not believe they are indicative of its current or ongoing operating results.\nTax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. This amount is used to present stock-based compensation and the other amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income.\nIn addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, the company also uses free cash flow. Free cash flow represents operating cash flows less purchases of property and equipment. The company considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property, buildings, and equipment, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in the company's business, make strategic acquisitions, and repurchase stock. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the company's cash balance for the period.\neBay Inc.\nReconciliation of GAAP Operating Margin to Non-GAAP Operating Margin\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n(In millions, except percentages)\nGAAP operating income\n$\n579\n$\n547\nStock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes\n126\n103\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets within cost of net revenues\n6\n7\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets within operating expenses\n10\n9\nTotal non-GAAP operating income adjustments\n142\n119\nNon-GAAP operating income\n$\n721\n$\n666\nNon-GAAP operating margin\n27.9\n%\n28.9\n%\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP Net Income and\nGAAP Effective Tax Rate to Non-GAAP Effective Tax Rate*\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n(In millions, except per share\namounts and percentages)\nGAAP income from continuing operations before income taxes\n$\n547\n$\n558\nGAAP provision for income taxes\n(140)\n477\nGAAP net income from continuing operations\n$\n407\n$\n1,035\nNon-GAAP adjustments to net income from continuing operations:\nNon-GAAP operating income from continuing operations adjustments (see table above)\n142\n119\nGains or losses on investments\n—\n(16)\nTax effect of step-up of intangible assets basis\n—\n(695)\nForeign exchange effect of step-up of intangible assets basis\n—\n65\nTax effect of non-GAAP adjustments\n(1)\n30\nNon-GAAP net income from continuing operations\n$\n548\n$\n538\nDiluted net income from continuing operations per share:\nGAAP\n$\n0.40\n$\n0.94\nNon-GAAP\n$\n0.53\n$\n0.49\nShares used in GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income (loss) per-share calculation\n1,029\n1,102\nGAAP effective tax rate - Continuing operations\n25.6\n%\n(85.4)\n%\nTax effect of non-GAAP adjustments to net income from continuing operations\n(5.2)\n%\n104.1\n%\nNon-GAAP effective tax rate - Continuing operations\n20.4\n%\n18.7\n%\n*Presented on a continuing operations basis\nReconciliation of Operating Cash Flow to Free Cash Flow*\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n(In millions)\nNet cash provided by continuing operating activities\n$\n495\n$\n582\nLess: Purchases of property and equipment\n(158)\n(135)\nFree cash flow from continuing operations\n$\n337\n$\n447\n*Presented on a continuing operations basis\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ebay-inc-reports-first-quarter-2018-results-300636638.html\nSOURCE eBay Inc.",
