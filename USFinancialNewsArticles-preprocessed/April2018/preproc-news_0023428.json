(“Mason Graphite” or the “Company”) (TSX.V:LLG) (OTCQX:MGPHF) is pleased to announce that Mario Felicetti has joined the Company as Vice-President, Sales effective immediately. In the immediate future, he will be based in Amsterdam and will eventually relocate to the Company’s Head Office in Montreal.\nMario Felicetti, MBA, Eng., is a Chemical Engineer with more than 15 years of experience in Sales and Marketing in several industrial areas including the last 5 years with Johnson Matthey, a global leader in sustainable technologies, where he had a special focus on energy storage materials. He was instrumental in defining and implementing their global commercial strategy as he negotiated several multiyear contracts with Li-ion battery manufacturers. He managed five regional sales offices in Tokyo, Seoul, Shanghai, Munich and Montreal through which he successfully commercialized new materials for cathodes and anodes.\nAs he joins the team, Mario will further advance discussions with customers, establish the required sales structure and develop the customers’ needs management system on which the production planning system will be based.\nBenoît Gascon, President and CEO of Mason Graphite commented: “We are very enthusiastic and eager to have Mario join us. After spending some time with our team in Montreal and reviewing the development work achieved so far, we all believe that he is the perfect fit for the Company and the upcoming commercialization of our battery materials. Having said this, his experience also includes several other industrial fields and Mario will be instrumental in the commercialization of our graphite products across all applications where he will be able to leverage our team’s experience.”\nThe management team of Mason Graphite has a proven track record in the commercialization of graphite products in all major applications and geographic areas. This is the result of a continuous effort to establish and maintain strong and long-term relationships with customers as well as properly understanding and meeting their specific needs. Flexibility to meet those needs, which can be significantly different from an application to another, was therefore incorporated right from the beginning in the design of Mason Graphite’s operations.\nAbout Mason Graphite and the Lac Guéret Project\nMason Graphite is a Canadian mining and processing company focused on the development of its 100% owned Lac Guéret natural graphite deposit located in northeastern Québec. The Company is led by a highly experienced team that has over five decades of experience in graphite production, sales, and research and development.
