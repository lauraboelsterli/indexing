    "text": "VALBONNE, France--(BUSINESS WIRE)--\nRegulatory News:\nTxCell SA (Paris:TXCL) (FR0010127662 – TXCL), a developer of cellular immunotherapies based on regulatory T cells (Tregs) for inflammation, autoimmunity and transplantation, today announces that its annual general meeting of shareholders held in Valbonne approved all proposed resolutions.\nThe quorum amounted to over 54%, with a number of 11,948,444 expressed votes, out of a total 21,831,009 voting rights.\nAll resolutions proposed by the management were voted in accordance with recommendations from the board of directors, with more than 94% of the voting rights. Details of votes are available on the company’s website: www.txcell.com .\nDuring the meeting, the terms of corporate officers of François Meyer Ph.D, Auriga Partners, Bpifrance Investissement and David Horn Solomon Ph.D were renewed for a period of four years until the ordinary general meeting that will vote on the financial statements for the financial year ending on December 31, 2021.\nIn addition, Stéphane Boissel’s mandate as CEO was renewed by the board of directors for a period of three years until the ordinary general meeting that will vote on the financial statements for the financial year ending on December 31, 2020.\n“During the general meeting, shareholders reiterated their continued support of the strategy set by the board of directors and executed by the management at TxCell,” said François Meyer, Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, TxCell. “The board of directors is convinced that the decision to focus TxCell’s research activities on the engineering of Tregs will lead to an improved Treg platform. TxCell is making significant progress and is on the right path to succeed.”\n“Firstly, I would like to thank the board of directors as well as the shareholders for their continuous support through the process of turning TxCell around strategically,” said Stéphane Boissel, CEO, TxCell. “We are strongly encouraged by the data obtained so far. Industry’s interest for Tregs as a therapeutic has never been so high and we see traction for TxCell’s positioning. In just 18 months we have put a new team in place and we believe to have demonstrated the proof of concept for CAR-Tregs, created a robust and scalable manufacturing process as well as a portfolio of patents to efficiently leverage on in the coming years.”\nAbout TxCell – www.txcell.com\nTxCell is a biotechnology company that develops platforms for innovative, personalized T cell immunotherapies for the treatment of severe inflammatory and autoimmune diseases with high unmet medical need. TxCell is targeting transplantation as well as a range of autoimmune diseases (both T-cell and B-cell-mediated), such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases or inflammatory skin diseases.\nTxCell’s cellular immunotherapies are based on regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs). Tregs are a T cell population discovered in the nineties for which anti-inflammatory properties have been demonstrated. Contrary to conventional approaches based on non-specific polyclonal Tregs, TxCell is exclusively developing engineered antigen-specific Tregs, where the antigen specificity is brought by a Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) (CAR-Treg cells).\nBased in Sophia-Antipolis, France, TxCell is listed on Euronext Paris and currently has 46 employees.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of TxCell, which shall not be considered per se as historical facts, including TxCell’s ability to develop, market, commercialize and achieve market acceptance for specific products, estimates for future performance and estimates regarding anticipated operating losses, future revenues, capital requirements, needs for additional financing.
