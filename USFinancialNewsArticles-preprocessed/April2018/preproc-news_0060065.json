    "text": "TOKYO, April 27 (Reuters) - Sony Corp said on Friday it expects operating profit to fall 8.8 percent in the financial year through March 2019 as a stronger yen eats into profits from the image sensor business.\nThe electronics and entertainment firm forecast profit to fall to 670 billion yen ($6.13 billion) from 734.86 billion yen a year prior, when earnings exceeded the previous peak set in the year through March 1998.\nThe outlook compared with the 765.04 billion average of 23 analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters. ($1 = 109.2800 yen) (Reporting by Makiko Yamazaki Editing by Christopher Cushing)\n ",
