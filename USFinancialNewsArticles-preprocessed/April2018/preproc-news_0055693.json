    "text": "April 26 (Reuters) - AbbVie Inc’s first-quarter revenue beat analysts’ estimates on Thursday on higher sales of its rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira and cancer treatment Imbruvica, while raising full-year earnings forecast.\nThe company’s net revenue rose 21.4 percent to $7.93 billion, ahead of average estimate of $7.59 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nSales of Humira, which account for nearly two-thirds of the company’s total revenue, rose to $4.71 billion, beating estimates of $4.64 billion.\nImbruvica raked in $762 million in sales, above expectations of $755.77 million.\nThe drugmaker raised its 2018 adjusted earnings per share expectation to between $7.66 and $7.76, from between $7.33 and $7.43 previously forecast.\nThe forecast accounts for an effective tax rate approaching 9 percent this year, AbbVie said.\nNet earnings rose to $2.78 billion, or $1.74 per share, in the three months ended March 31, from $1.71 billion, or $1.06 per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, AbbVie earned $1.87 per share.
