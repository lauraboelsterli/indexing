    "text": "April 6, 2018 / 12:57 PM / Updated 38 minutes ago Farnese blue diamond goes on sale after 300 years of royal history Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - The historically important Farnese Blue diamond, which was passed down through European royal families for some 300 years, is to go on sale for the first time next month, auctioneers Sotheby’s said. A model poses with 'The Farnese Blue' diamond at Sotheby's auction house in London, Britain, April 6, 2018. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls \nExpected to fetch between $3.7 and 5.3 million, the 6.1 carat, dark grey-blue stone from the Golconda diamond mines of India was first given to Elisabeth Farnese, daughter of the Duke of Parma, in 1715 when she married Philip V of Spain. \nIt was passed down through more than seven generations and, as their descendants married into other European families, it travelled from Spain to France, Italy and Austria.

Except for close relatives, and of course the family jewellers, no one knew about its existence,” Sotheby’s said. \nThe stone will appear in Sotheby’s Geneva Jewellery sale on 15 May.
