REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett/File Photo \nThe British company, which targets twenty-something shoppers, reported retail sales of 1.13 billion pounds, and pretax profit of 29.9 million pounds, just shy of average market forecasts. \nChief Executive Nick Beighton said the company was trading strongly, with visits to its site exceeding 1 billion in the six months to end-February for the first time. \n“Alongside our investment in our people and our technology, we are accelerating investment in our distribution and logistics, laying the foundation for 4 billion pounds of net sales,” he said. \nThe company said capital expenditure for the full year was now expected to be 230-250 million pounds, an increase on the 200-220 million pounds it predicted in January. \nIt kept its forecast for around 25-30 percent reported sales growth for the year unchanged, along with its target of an operating profit margin of about 4 percent. \nAnalysts were expecting retail sales of 1.15 billion pounds and pretax profit of 30.8 million pounds for its first half, according to a consensus of 19 analysts.
