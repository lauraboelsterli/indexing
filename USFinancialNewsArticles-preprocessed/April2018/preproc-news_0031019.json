Total tonnes milled during the period was 3.5 million tonnes at an average head grade of 0.328% copper.\nMining production : Open pit mining averaged 184,300 tonnes of material per day during the first quarter, within 3% of our 190,000 tpd guidance with the slight decrease related to the abnormal high snow fall.\nMining activities continued from the Pit 2, Saddle and Oriole areas during the quarter. A total of 16.6 million tonnes of material was mined, including 6.5 million tonnes of ore and 10.1 million tonnes of waste, resulting in a strip ratio of 1.54 to 1.\nMr. Jim O'Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer of Copper Mountain Mining, said \"The operation performed well during the quarter despite the abnormally high snow fall causing some challenges in the pit and a minor disruption in power supply. These challenges were handled well by the crew which has kept us on track to meet our 2018 production guidance of 80 million pounds copper.\"\nCopper Mountain will hold a conference call on Friday April 27, 2018 at 7:30 am (Pacific Standard Time) for management to discuss the Q1 2018 Financial and Operating Results.

The Company has a strategic alliance with Mitsubishi Materials Corporation who owns 25% of the mine. The Copper Mountain mine has a large resource of copper that remains open laterally and at depth. This significant exploration potential will be explored over the next few years in order to fully appreciate the property's full development potential. Recently, Copper Mountain shareholders approved the acquisition of Altona Mining Limited which brings with it approximately A$30M cash, the Cloncurry project with development-ready Eva Copper Project and a massive exploration potential in the acquired ~ 4,000 square km (379,000 hectare) mineralized land package within the highly prospective Mt. Isa inlier area in Queensland, Australia.\nAdditional information is available on the Company's web page at www.CuMtn.com .\nOn behalf of the Board of\nCOPPER MOUNTAIN MINING CORPORATION\n\"Jim O'Rourke\"\nJim O'Rourke, P.Eng.\nChief Executive Officer\nNote: This release contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
