Investors would also need more details on the IHH offer, the analyst said. \nIHH operates healthcare facilities across nine countries via a network of 49 hospitals including Mount Elizabeth and Gleneagles in Singapore. \nSeparately, two Indian investors - Sunil Munjal’s Hero Enterprise and the Burman Family Office — offered last week to make an investment worth 12.5 billion rupees ($191.5 million) in Fortis.
