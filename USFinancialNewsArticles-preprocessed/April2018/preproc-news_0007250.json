    "text": "April 3 (Reuters) - Aircraft parts maker Triumph Group Inc and Gulfstream Aerospace, a unit of General Dynamics Corp, plan to reallocate the assembly of components jointly produced at both companies to fewer and more automated plants.\nTriumph said the agreement includes a plan for reallocating work between Triumph’s Tulsa, Oklahoma and Nashville, Tennessee plants and Gulfstream’s Savannah, Georgia facility.\nThe G650 jet’s wing box and wing completion work, which are now co-produced at the three plants, are expected to move to Gulfstream’s Savannah factory, Triumph said.\nThe aircraft parts maker said it would maintain its role as the supply chain integrator on the program, and that it expects the actions to have a positive impact on its long-term financial performance.\nTriumph makes parts for Gulfstream’s business jet wings, leading edges, stringers, skins, flaps, and composite components.
