    "text": "FRANKFURT, April 20 (Reuters) - European prompt power prices fell on Friday ahead of a week that will bring more renewable and thermal supply while demand is gradually falling in line with the season.\n* “There is a high wind ramp-up in Germany while thermal capacity is also solid,” one trader said.\n* Germany’s baseload delivery contract for Monday slipped 19.8 percent from the Friday delivery price to 31 euros ($38.14) a megawatt hour (MWh).\n* The same French price dropped 13.2 percent to 33 euros.\n* Daily German power demand will tick up 0.2 gigawatts (GW) on Monday to reach 59.7 GW but drop by an average 1.7 GW over next week compared with the level recorded for Friday, Thomson Reuters data showed.\n* French power usage will likely be down 0.4 GW from Friday’s level on Monday, standing at 45.1 GW, and lose 0.5 GW on a weekly average, it showed.\n* In the nuclear sector, French generation availability has risen 2.2 percentage points since Wednesday to 73.3 percent of total capacity while in Germany, the Gundremmingen C reactor will start its long-planned outage on Saturday.\n* However, thermal capacity in Germany and interconnected Austria, put together, is likely to remain strong next week and add 0.2 percent to perhaps 51.2 GW over the next seven days to April 27, EEX bourse data showed.\n* Along the forward curve, Germany’s Cal’19 key contract was 0.7 percent off at 37.75 euros, having hit 38.75 euros on Monday, a contract record.\n* The equivalent French contract for 2019 was 0.5 percent down at 42.8 euros.\n* European carbon emissions rights for December 2018 expiry plummeted by 4 percent to 12.92 euros a tonne, following rallies earlier in the week.\n* Cif Europe coal for 2019 added 0.9 percent to $83.25 a tonne.\n* The fuels price environment overall remains bullish in Europe, traders said, despite falling oil and carbon prices on Friday. They cited low gas storage levels and ongoing attempts to create a minimum price level for emissions certificates.\n* In eastern Europe, the Czech Monday contract, was untraded after a 46.75 euros close seen for Friday. Czech Year-Ahead was 45 cents down at 38.95 euros. ($1 = 0.8129 euros) (Reporting by Vera Eckert Editing by Edmund Blair)\n ",
