Think about going to an office, getting on a plane, logging to a website or making an online purchase. Identity is the key that determines the particular transactions in which we can rightfully participate as well as the information we’re entitled to access. But we generally don’t pay much attention to the management of our identity credentials unless something goes seriously wrong.\nFor much of history, our identity systems have been based on face-to-face interactions and on physical documents and processes. But the transition to a digital economy requires radically different identity systems. In a world that’s increasingly governed by digital transactions and data, our existing methods for managing digital identities and privacy are proving inadequate. Data breaches, large-scale fraud, and identity theft are becoming more common.\nData attributes associated with identity are generally siloed within different private and public sector institutions, each using its data for its own purposes. To reach a higher level of privacy and security, we need to establish trusted data ecosystems, which requires the exchange and sharing of data across a variety of institutions. The more data sources a trusted ecosystem has access to, the higher the probability of detecting fraud and identity theft while reducing false positives.\nBut safeguarding the data used to validate identities creates security and privacy issues of its own. It’s unsafe to gather all the needed attributes within one institution or central data location, making it a target for data breaches. But, it’s also highly unfeasible, as few institutions will let their critical data out of their premises.\nThere are innovative ways to move forward. One such approach is the identity and data sharing framework being developed by MIT’s Trust::Data Consortium, which was founded by Media Lab professor Sandy Pentland to create an open platform, tools and services that foster the development of a secure internet-based network of trusted data. The Trust::Data Consortium is part of the MIT Connection Science initiative, which I’m involved with as a Fellow.\nA few weeks ago, Mr. Pentland and Connection Science CTO Thomas Hardjono published Digital Identity is Broken. Here’s a Way to Fix It , a guest column in the WSJ CIO Journal. “Most people today suffer from a strange sort of psychosis: we are uncertain of our identity. For although we are (mostly) certain of who we are in our own minds, the identity we use to interact with the government, obtain services, and pay for goods is unreliable.”\nThe Trust::Data Consortium has been developing a digital identity and data sharing framework called Open Algorithms for Identity Federation. “The identity problem today is a data-sharing problem,” they write right up front. But just having access to static or fixed attributes is of limited value to the participants in an identity ecosystem, in addition to potentially compromising the information being shared. What’s needed is the ability to share information in a privacy-preserving manner. Instead of exchanging static attributes, the paper proposes the collective exchange of vetted algorithms among the participants in the trust network ecosystem, a paradigm it calls Open Algorithms, whose tagline is bring the code to the data .\nOPAL is designed to address a number of key challenges relating to the safe management of identities, starting with the unmanageable proliferation of identity identifiers, such as an e-mail address, which are created to support access to each separate internet account. This results in a massive and risky duplication of our personal data, as internet services needlessly hold the same set of attributes associated with each user. In many cases users have little knowledge about the actions taken with their data beyond what they initially consented to. Not surprisingly, we’ve seen a diminishing trust in the institutions holding our data, especially given the recent spate of attacks, thefts and misuse of massive amounts of data.\nThe OPAL paradigm is based on several key principles, including:\nMove the algorithm to the data. Instead of gathering raw data into a central location for processing, the algorithms or queries should be sent to the repositories and be processed there. Only “safe” answers are returned. Decentralized data architecture. Raw data must always remain in its permanent repository under the control of the repository owners. Only the “safe” results of applying the algorithm or query against the data are returned. Open, vetted algorithms. Algorithms must be openly published, agreed to, and vetted by experts to be “safe” from privacy violations, bias, and other unintended consequences. Subject consent. Data repositories must obtain explicit consent from the subjects whose data they hold for the execution of an algorithm against their data; the vetted algorithms should be made available and understandable to subjects. Data Federation. In a group-based trust network ecosystem, algorithms must be vetted collectively by all the members of the ecosystem; each member must observe the OPAL principles and legal frameworks. Data is always in an encrypted state. Data must be encrypted while stored, transmitted and when algorithms are applied against it. Transparency and regulatory compliance. All requests and responses must be logged, to enable the auditing of all interactions, as well as proof of regulatory compliance. Blockchain technologies could be used to provide a shared, immutable log of events. Apply correct pricing models for algorithms and data. A correct pricing structure needs to be developed by the members of a trust network ecosystem, to encourage data owners to develop new business models based on the OPAL paradigm. “Instead of sharing fixed-attributes regarding a user or subject, the OPAL paradigm offers a way… to share vetted algorithms,” says the article in conclusion. “This in turn provides better insight into the user’s behavior, with their consent. It also allows for the development of a trust network ecosystem consisting of these entities, providing new revenue sources, governed by relevant legal agreements and contracts that form the basis for a information sharing legal trust framework.”\nIrving Wladawsky-Berger worked at IBM for 37 years and has been a strategic advisor to Citigroup and to HBO.
