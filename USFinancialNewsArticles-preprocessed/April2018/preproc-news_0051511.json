    "text": "ONTARIO, Calif. (AP) â€” All gates at Southern California's Ontario International Airport are open again after part of a terminal was briefly evacuated while a bomb squad investigated a suspicious device.\nFire Department Battalion Chief Jim Schiller says the item found in a passenger's luggage around 5 a.m. Monday was determined to be an inert device typically used for military training.\nSchiller says the male passenger, a member of the military, was cooperative. He was not detained, but authorities confiscated the device.\nDuring the investigation, authorities evacuated three gates in Terminal 4 at the airport 40 miles (65 kilometers) east of Los Angeles. Travelers were let back in after about an hour and a half.",
