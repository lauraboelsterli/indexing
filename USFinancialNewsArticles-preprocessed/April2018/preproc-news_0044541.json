    "text": "54 COMMENTS JERUSALEM—Israel faces a harsh new world as Syria’s civil war winds down: while Iran remains far away, the Iranian threat now is next door.\nThere are several hundred miles and two countries separating Israel and Iran, whose leaders openly seek to dismantle the Jewish state. Iranian military forces, however, are already entrenching themselves in Syrian bases within striking distance of Israeli towns.\nIn Israeli assessments, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and other units in Syria have now switched their primary mission from preventing a collapse of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s regime to preparing for a future confrontation with Israel.\nMore Middle East Crossroads\nIsrael Caught in U.S.-Russia Rift Over Syria April 11, 2018 Turkey and Russia Forge Bond as Trump Weighs Syria Exit April 5, 2018 How the Middle East’s Conflicts Shut Down Its Skies March 29, 2018 Saudis, U.A.E.

Now their first priority has changed and Israel is the target,” said retired Maj. Gen. Yaakov Amidror, who served as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s national security adviser from 2011 to 2013. “They want to prevent Israel from reacting in any way to the next stage, in which Iran is building its nuclear capability. For us it is essential to stop Iran and for that we are ready to take the risk of a war.”\nIsrael’s nightmare scenario is that of South Korea, which watched helplessly as the North developed a nuclear bomb because any military action to stop that program could have resulted in the destruction of Seoul by North Korea’s conventional artillery barrages.\nThe Feb. 10 incursion of an Iranian drone (armed, according to Israel), and at least two Israeli raids on the Iranian drone center at Syria’s T-4 air base since then, have marked the first direct skirmishes between these two regional powers. Iran has vowed to avenge the death of its personnel in the Israeli strikes.\nUnless Iran backs down on its Syrian buildup—something that Tehran shows no intention of doing so far—this confrontation is only bound to escalate in coming weeks and months, potentially embroiling the U.S. and Russia , the two superpowers that are also actively engaged in Syria.\nIranian troops marched during a parade outside Tehran on Wednesday. Photo: Ebrahim Noroozi/Associated Press Letting Tehran solidify its military presence in Syria would be “agreeing to the Iranians placing a noose around our necks,” Israel’s Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman warned on a visit near the cease-fire line with Syria in the Golan Heights last week.\nRussia, which—unlike the U.S.—is friendly with both nations, has been trying to defuse this looming clash.\n“The situation is getting more dangerous with every day. But Russia is employing all efforts so that things don’t take a turn for the worse,” said Elena Suponina, a Middle East expert at the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies in Moscow. “A direct confrontation between Israel and Iran is not in Russia’s interests.”\nFor Iran, seeking to wipe out the Israeli state has become a central tenet of the Islamic Republic’s ideology since the 1979 revolution.\nEmbracing a Pan-Islamic cause such as the liberation of Palestine permits Iran’s regime to shore up its legitimacy and to stake a claim on leading not just Shiite Muslims but the wider Muslim world—a valuable tool in Tehran’s separate confrontation with a rival Sunni bloc led by Saudi Arabia .\nRelated Video The recent airstrikes against the Syrian regime, in response to a suspected poison gas attack, underscore the West's shift from pursuing a diplomatic solution to a militaristic one.

Still, until recently, Iran stayed out of direct conflict with Israel and mostly relied on proxies such as Lebanon’s Hezbollah militia —which, too, refrained from significant military action against Israel since a bloody war in 2006 established a tenuous calm on the Israeli-Lebanese frontier.\nThe Feb. 10 Iranian dispatch of a non-stealth knockoff of the American RQ-170 Sentinel drone, which penetrated Israel via Jordan carrying an explosive payload, according to Israeli officials, represented the first direct hostile action by the Iranian military.\n“Both sides are testing each other’s limits in a game that is really dangerous. There are unwritten understandings between Syria and Israel, and even between Israel and Hezbollah, but in the current case the rules of the game are not clear,” said Ali Vaez, Iran expert at the International Crisis Group conflict-resolution think tank. “The situation is ripe for a single miscalculation and could then spiral out of control.”\nWhile Israelis are divided over how to handle the Palestinian issue, officials across the country’s mainstream political spectrum agree that a war with Iran may soon become inevitable.\n“Iran is the cancer in the Middle East. We will not give it a chance to sit next to our border,” said Akram Hasson, a member of Israel’s parliament from Mr. Netanyahu’s government coalition and a representative of the country’s Arab Druze minority. “And if it doesn’t work in a diplomatic way, then we will use every other solution. If it will have to be a war to defend our cities and our citizens, then we will have to go to war.”\nKsenia Svetlova, a lawmaker from the center-left opposition’s Zionist Union party, also warned about a likely escalation. “The strengthening of Iranian positions would force Israel to act—and not like now, but in a different fashion,” she said. “Everything would be engulfed in flames. All scenarios are possible.”\nIn this environment, President Donald Trump’s stated desire to withdraw U.S. forces from Syria—which, if it happens, would be a major strategic boon to Iran and Russia—is only fueling Israel’s sense that it must act against Iran before it’s too late, potentially making a conflict more likely.\n“The consequences [of Trump’s statements] are clear,” said Mr. Amidror, the former Israeli national security adviser. “Israel may find itself having to do the critical job of containing Iran in the Levant by itself.”\nWrite to Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.com",
