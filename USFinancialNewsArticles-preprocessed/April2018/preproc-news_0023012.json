REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader “I believe in this situation around 60 (dollars per barrel) is a good price,” said Zangeneh, who was attending the International Energy Forum.\n“I think we should look at the market not for short-term, long-term, mid-term is important for us,” he said. “It is very important for producers and consumers not to have volatility in the market.”\nWhen asked if global benchmark Brent oil trading at $70 a barrel were too high, Zangeneh answered, “Yes.”\nZangeneh added that he hopes India and Iran can finalize the main issue on the development of the Farzad B natural gas field in the next two months.\nEditing by Christian Schmollinger\n ",
