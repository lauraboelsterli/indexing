    "text": "Oakland’s 3-4-5 hitters, Jed Lowrie, Khris Davis and Matt Chapman, all homered as the A’s pounded out a season-high 21 hits in a 16-6 rout of the host Los Angeles Dodgers on Wednesday.\nLowrie had three hits and drove in four runs, Davis had three hits and two RBIs and Chapman added two hits and three RBIs.\nMarcus Semien had two hits and four RBIs as every A’s starter had at least one hit in support of right-hander Daniel Mengden (1-2). Jonathan Lucroy and Matt Olson had three hits apiece.\nYasmani Grandal had three hits including a homer, Matt Kemp had three hits, and Enrique Hernandez homered for the Dodgers, who were looking for their first three-game winning streak of the season.\nThe A’s jumped to a 7-1 lead off Dodgers left-hander Alex Wood (0-2) in the fourth inning. Davis hit a two-run homer in the first and doubled to open a five-run fourth that included a two-run double by Semien and an RBI single by Mengden, who had his first major league RBI on his second career hit.\nChapman hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning, and Lowrie added a three-run shot in the ninth.\nMengden gave up seven hits and four runs (three earned) in five-plus innings. He struck out five and did not walk a batter. He had the first RBI for an Oakland pitcher since Scott Kazmir collected one in 2015.\nWood gave up seven hits and seven runs in 3 2/3 innings, allowing four runs with two outs in the fourth. He struck out five and did not walk a batter. He has not issued a walk in his first three starts covering 17 2/3 innings.\nThe Dodgers had won their past 10 interleague home games and 14 of their past 15.\nThe Dodgers closed to 9-4 with two runs in the last of the sixth inning, but former Dodgers center fielder Trayce Thompson kept the A’s comfortably ahead when he reached his glove over the fence to take a two-run homer away from Yasiel Puig to end the sixth.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
