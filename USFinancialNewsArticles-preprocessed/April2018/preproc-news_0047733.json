Forward-looking statements may be identified by words like \"anticipate,\" \"expect,\" \"project,\" \"believe,\" \"plan,\" \"estimate,\" \"intend,\" \"aiming\" and similar words. These forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and estimates using information available to us at the time and are not intended to be guarantees of future events or performance. These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements regarding our expected net sales, GAAP, operational and organic revenue growth rates, GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings for the second quarter and full year 2018, our financial performance, our business plans and our positioning for revenue and earnings growth. If our underlying assumptions turn out to be incorrect, or if certain risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties, in some cases, have affected and in the future could affect our ability to implement our business strategy and may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the statements expressed in this press release. As a result, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any of our forward-looking statements.\nRisks and uncertainties that may cause such differences include, among other things: future economic, political, competitive, reimbursement and regulatory conditions, new product introductions and the market acceptance of those products, markets for our products, expected pricing environment, expected procedural volumes, the closing and integration of acquisitions, clinical trial results, demographic trends, intellectual property rights, litigation, financial market conditions, the execution and effect of our restructuring program, the execution and effect of our business strategy, including our cost-savings and growth initiatives and future business decisions made by us and our competitors. New risks and uncertainties may arise from time to time and are difficult to predict. All of these factors are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of them are beyond our control. For a further list and description of these and other important risks and uncertainties that may affect our future operations, see Part I, Item IA - Risk Factors in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we may update in Part II, Item 1A - Risk Factors in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q we have filed or will file hereafter. We disclaim any intention or obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement to reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions, or circumstances on which those expectations may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. This cautionary statement is applicable to all forward-looking statements contained in this press release.\nNote : Amounts reported in millions within this press release are computed based on the amounts in thousands. As a result, the sum of the components reported in millions may not equal the total amount reported in millions due to rounding. Certain columns and rows within tables may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying numbers in dollars. Prior year balances were subject to rounding.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nA reconciliation of the company's non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measures, and an explanation of the company's use of these non-GAAP financial measures, is included in the exhibits attached to this press release.\nCONTACT:\nMedia:\nKate Haranis\nInvestors:\nSusie Lisa, CFA\n508-683-6585 (office)\n508-683-5565 (office)\nMedia Relations\nInvestor Relations\nBoston Scientific Corporation\nBoston Scientific Corporation\nkate.haranis@bsci.com\nBSXInvestorRelations@bsci.com\nBOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORPORATION\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED GAAP RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31,\nin millions, except per share data\n2018\n2017\nNet sales\n$\n2,379\n$\n2,160\nCost of products sold\n672\n650\nGross profit\n1,707\n1,510\nOperating expenses:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n860\n794\nResearch and development expenses\n261\n235\nRoyalty expense\n18\n17\nAmortization expense\n141\n143\nIntangible asset impairment charges\n1\n—\nContingent consideration expense (benefit)\n5\n(50)\nRestructuring charges (credits)\n13\n4\nLitigation-related net charges (credits)\n—\n3\n1,300\n1,146\nOperating income (loss)\n407\n364\nOther income (expense):\nInterest expense\n(61)\n(57)\nOther, net\n(23)\n(2)\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n323\n305\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n26\n15\nNet income (loss)\n$\n298\n$\n290\nNet income (loss) per common share -

These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Further, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nTo calculate adjusted net income (earnings) and adjusted net income (earnings) per share we exclude certain charges (credits) from GAAP net income, including amortization expense, intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related net charges (credits), restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits), litigation-related net charges (credits), certain investment impairment charges and certain discrete tax items, including net income tax charges resulting from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017. Amounts are tax effected at the company's effective tax rate, unless the amount is a significant unusual or infrequently occurring item in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification section 740-270-30, \"General Methodology and Use of Estimated Annual Effective Tax Rate.\" Please refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our most recent Annual Report filed on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an explanation of each of these adjustments and the reasons for excluding each item.\nThe GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share is GAAP net income and GAAP net income per share.\nTo calculate operational net sales, which exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we convert actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period. To calculate organic net sales, we remove the impact of recent acquisitions with significant sales from operational net sales. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to operational net sales and organic net sales is net sales on a GAAP basis.\nReconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included in the accompanying schedules.\nManagement uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors, and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments. With the exception of the impact of recent acquisitions with significant sales, the adjustments excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments' measures of net sales and profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance.\nWe believe that presenting adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share, operational net sales and organic net sales, in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results \"through the eyes\" of management. We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/boston-scientific-announces-results-for-first-quarter-2018-300636027.html\nSOURCE Boston Scientific Corporation",
