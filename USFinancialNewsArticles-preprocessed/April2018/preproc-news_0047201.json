    "text": "HANOVER, N.H.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Ledyard Financial Group, Inc. (ticker symbol LFGP), the holding company for Ledyard National Bank, today reported record quarterly earnings for the first quarter of 2018. Net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $1,207,304 or $0.39 per share compared to $1,006,669 or $0.33 per share for the same period in 2017, an increase of $200,635. The strength of the Company’s core businesses combined with a lower federal tax rate due to the adoption of tax reform are the primary contributing factors to the improvement in operating results and returns to shareholders.\nThe Company reported total revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, of $6,679,840 compared to $5,986,556 for the same period in 2017, for an increase of $693,284 or 11.6%.

The factors contributing to increased expense were costs associated with a new core system search, the filling of previously open positions, and increased costs associated with a new operations center.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company’s shareholders’ equity stood at $46 million compared to $44 million for the same period in 2017.
