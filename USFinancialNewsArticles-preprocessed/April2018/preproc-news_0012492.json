    "text": "SAN DIEGO, April 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Turtle Beach Corporation (NASDAQ: HEAR), a leading gaming headset and audio accessory company, is providing selected preliminary results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Per share information reflects the Company's 1-for-4 reverse split effective April 6, 2018.\nBased on preliminary unaudited information, Turtle Beach expects to report first quarter 2018 net revenue ranging between $39.5 and $40.5 million (prior guidance of approximately $29 million), up 174%-181% compared to $14.4 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet income in the first quarter of 2018 is expected to range between $(0.05) and $0.03 per share (prior guidance of approximately $(0.48) per share on a split-adjusted basis), up significantly compared to $(0.81) per share in the first quarter of 2017 on a split-adjusted basis.\nThe Company expects adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2018 to range between $3.5 and $4.5 million (prior guidance of $(1.5) million), up significantly compared to $(6.2) million in the first quarter of 2017.\n\"The strong start we experienced early in the first quarter has accelerated, further increasing our significant Q1 growth,\" said Juergen Stark, CEO, Turtle Beach. \"The blockbuster releases of Fortnite and PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds have helped fuel strong consumer demand, driving new gamers into the market and increasing headset attach rates. In parallel, we've gained additional market share resulting in substantial Q1 growth that exceeded healthy console headset market growth, translating into strong expected revenue and earnings growth, both relative to last year and our prior outlook.\n\"In fact, according to gaming console headset market data in NPD's North American video games update, year-to-date through February 2018 we grew our revenue share 640 basis points to 45.4% versus 39.0% in the same period in 2017. While the market was up 67% on a sell-through basis during the same time period, Turtle Beach was up 94%. The U.K. has shown similar trends, with our revenue share in the first three months of 2018 climbing to 55.8% from 42.5% in the same period in 2017.\n\"Turtle Beach has continued to outpace a healthy market with a product portfolio for every gamer, global distribution and retail partnerships, all supported by strong marketing and merchandising. We expect our first quarter results to enable further reduction in our debt over time and selective growth investments, setting the stage for a strong 2018.\"\nTurtle Beach expects to update its full year outlook when it announces its first quarter 2018 earnings, which is expected to be released in early May.\nImportant Note on First Quarter 2018 Preliminary Estimates:\nThe financial information included herein for the first quarter of 2018 are preliminary, unaudited estimates and may change materially, including as a result of the finalization of financial statements for the Company's first quarter ended March 31, 2018, review of inventory levels that could require additional reserves, review of sales-related reserves, completion of review procedures performed by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, and other factors and adjustments related to the Company's financial reporting process. The preceding estimates are based on the Company's internal estimates and information available as of the date hereof. There can be no assurance that our final results for the quarter will not differ from these estimates and that such changes will not be material; accordingly, these statements should not be viewed or relied upon as a substitute for complete financial statements to be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or as a measure of our actual performance. The Company's final results for the first quarter of 2018 are expected to be released in early May.\nWith respect to the Company's preliminary, expected adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of 2018, a reconciliation to net income has not been provided because certain reconciling items between adjusted EBITDA and net income cannot be reasonably and accurately predicted at this time without unreasonable effort and the investment of undue time, cost and other resources. Accordingly, the Company will include a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the related GAAP measure in the release reporting the Company's final results for the first quarter.\nAbout Turtle Beach Corporation\nTurtle Beach ( www.turtlebeach.com ) has been revolutionizing console multiplayer gaming since the very beginning with its wide selection of industry leading, award-winning gaming headsets.
