I’m personally committed so that the transformation is successful,” Mustier said referring to his “Transform 2019” turnaround plan launched last year. \n“I’m certain that also for all of 2018 we will work together to ensure that UniCredit is a truly pan-European winning lender.” (Reporting by Stefano Bernabei, writing by Agnieszka Flak, editing by Valentina Za)",
