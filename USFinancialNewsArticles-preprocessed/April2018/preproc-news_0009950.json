    "text": "LAKE OSWEGO, Ore., April 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. (NYSE: GBX) today reported financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended February 28, 2018.\nSecond Quarter Highlights\nNet earnings attributable to Greenbrier for the quarter were $61.6million, or $1.91 per diluted share, on revenue of $629.3 million. Quarterly results included $0.89 per diluted share related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted December 22, 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $79.1 million, or 12.6% of revenue. Orders for 3,400 diversified railcars were received during this quarter, valued at over $265 million. New railcar backlog as of February 28, 2018 was 24,100 units with an estimated value of $2.3 billion. New railcar deliveries totaled 4,900 units for the quarter. Board increases quarterly dividend 9% to $0.25 per share, payable on May 16, 2018 to shareholders as of April 25, 2018. Subsequent to quarter end, Greenbrier's $119 million of 3.5% convertible notes converted into equity. Under the \"if-converted\" method, the shares were already included in EPS calculations and guidance. If the conversion would have occurred in February, total equity would have been $1.4 billion with total assets of $2.4 billion.\nWilliam A. Furman, Chairman and CEO, said, \"The North American railcar market is improving but remains competitive. Greenbrier's performance reflects the creativity and flexibility of its people and the strength of our strategy in North America and around the world. Greenbrier's international expansion now meaningfully contributes each quarter with new sources of revenue and diversification of backlog. Nearly half of year-to-date order activity was generated in markets outside of North America. We are replicating Greenbrier's core business model as part of the railcar renewal cycles in Brazil and parts of Europe.\"\nFurman continued, \"For the quarter we secured orders for 3,400 units globally, ending the quarter with 24,100 units in backlog, valued at $2.3 billion. At the midpoint of the fiscal year we are confident of achieving full year guidance; a validation of the strength and value of Greenbrier's market approach. Cash flow remains strong, enabling us to continue a balanced capital allocation strategy. The Board of Directors approved a 9% increase in quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share, part of Greenbrier's ongoing commitment to returning capital to shareholders in a prudent and efficient manner.\"\nFurman concluded, \"Greenbrier's strong backlog, driven by a broad product line and innovative service offerings, allows discipline in the current competitive environment. Growing customer confidence and increased utilization of the North American rail fleet is generating increased demand for Greenbrier products and services. Greenbrier creates transactions tailored for customers' success. Our strategy remains to grow the business, domestically and internationally, well beyond the current fiscal year.\"\nBusiness Outlook\nBased on current business trends, industry forecasts and production schedules for fiscal 2018, Greenbrier believes:\nDeliveries will be approximately 20,000 – 22,000 units including Greenbrier-Maxion (Brazil) which will account for up to 10% of deliveries Revenue will be $2.4 – $2.6 billion Diluted EPS will be $5.00 including a second quarter benefit of $0.89 from the Tax Act and a lower tax rate going forward\nAs noted in the \"Safe Harbor\" statement, there are risks to achieving this guidance.

Greenbrier uses words such as \"anticipates,\" \"believes,\" \"forecast,\" \"potential,\" \"goal,\" \"contemplates,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"projects,\" \"hopes,\" \"seeks,\" \"estimates,\" \"strategy,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"likely,\" \"will,\" \"may,\" \"can,\" \"designed to,\" \"future,\" \"foreseeable future\" and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to, reported backlog and awards that are not indicative of Greenbrier's financial results; uncertainty or changes in the credit markets and financial services industry; high levels of indebtedness and compliance with the terms of Greenbrier's indebtedness; write-downs of goodwill, intangibles and other assets in future periods; sufficient availability of borrowing capacity; fluctuations in demand for newly manufactured railcars or failure to obtain orders as anticipated in developing forecasts; loss of one or more significant customers; customer payment defaults or related issues; policies and priorities of the federal government regarding international trade, taxation and infrastructure; sovereign risk to contracts, exchange rates or property rights; actual future costs and the availability of materials and a trained workforce; failure to design or manufacture new products or technologies or to achieve certification or market acceptance of new products or technologies; steel or specialty component price fluctuations and availability and scrap surcharges; changes in product mix and the mix between segments; labor disputes, energy shortages or operating difficulties that might disrupt manufacturing operations or the flow of cargo; production difficulties and product delivery delays as a result of, among other matters, costs or inefficiencies associated with expansion, start-up, or changing of production lines or changes in production rates, changing technologies, transfer of production between facilities or non-performance of alliance partners, subcontractors or suppliers; ability to obtain suitable contracts for the sale of leased equipment and risks related to car hire and residual values; integration of current or future acquisitions and establishment of joint ventures; succession planning; discovery of defects in railcars or services resulting in increased warranty costs or litigation; physical damage or product or service liability claims that exceed Greenbrier's insurance coverage; train derailments or other accidents or claims that could subject Greenbrier to legal claims; actions or inactions by various regulatory agencies including potential environmental remediation obligations or changing tank car or other railcar or railroad regulation; and issues arising from investigations of whistleblower complaints; all as may be discussed in more detail under the headings \"Risk Factors\" and \"Forward Looking Statements\" in Greenbrier's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017, Greenbrier's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2017, and Greenbrier's other reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management's opinions only as of the date hereof. Except as otherwise required by law, Greenbrier does not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This metric is a performance measurement tool commonly used by rail supply companies and Greenbrier. You should not consider this metric in isolation or as a substitute for other financial statement data determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because this metric is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and is susceptible to varying calculations, this measure presented may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as Net earnings before Interest and foreign exchange, Income tax expense (benefit) and Depreciation and amortization. We believe the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information as it excludes the impact of financing, foreign exchange, income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending. These items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to the overall operating performance of a company's core business. We believe this assists in comparing our performance across reporting periods.\nTHE GREENBRIER COMPANIES, INC.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands, unaudited)\nFebruary 28,\n2018\nNovember

The first approach includes the dilutive effect of using the treasury stock method, associated with shares underlying the 2024 Convertible notes and performance based restricted stock units that are subject to performance criteria, for which actual levels of performance above target have been achieved. The second approach supplements the first by including the \"if converted\" effect of the 2018 Convertible notes. Under the \"if converted method\" debt issuance and interest costs, both net of tax, associated with the convertible notes are added back to net earnings and the share count is increased by the shares underlying the convertible notes. The 2024 Convertible notes are included in the calculation of both approaches using the treasury stock method when the average stock price is greater than the applicable conversion price.\nThree Months Ended\nFebruary 28,\n2018\nNovember 30,\n2017\nNet earnings attributable to Greenbrier\n$ 61,642\n$ 26,253\nAdd back:\nInterest and debt issuance costs on the 2018 Convertible notes, net of tax\n843\n733\nEarnings before interest and debt issuance costs on convertible notes\n$ 62,485\n$ 26,986\nWeighted average diluted common shares outstanding\n32,711\n32,696\nDiluted earnings per share\n$ 1.91\n$ 0.83\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/greenbrier-reports-second-quarter-results-300625487.html\nSOURCE The Greenbrier Companies, Inc.
