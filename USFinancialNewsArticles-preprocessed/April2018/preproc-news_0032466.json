    "text": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - Phillips 66 was restarting the gasoline-producing units at its 146,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Borger, Texas, refinery on Monday, said sources familiar with plant operations.\nAll other units at the Borger refinery have restarted following a planned overhaul that finished last week, the sources said.\nPhillips 66 said on Monday that planned maintenance was under way at the refinery, but declined to say which units were involved.\nThe two 30,000-bpd catalytic cracking units were shut on April 11 because of a malfunction on the hydrotreater serving both units, according to the sources. The hydrotreater restarted over the weekend.\nThe Borger refinery is a 50-50 joint venture between Phillips 66 and Cenovus Energy. Phillips 66 is the managing partner.\nReporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Jonathan Oatis and Sandra Maler\n ",
