    "text": "SKOPJE (Reuters) - Macedonia expects to secure a date soon to start membership talks with the European Union and will step up its efforts to implement the reforms needed to join, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev said on Friday.\nMacedonia won its candidacy status in 2005, but the accession talks remain blocked by Greece due to a decades-long dispute about the name of the former Yugoslav republic.\nSince he took over last year, Zaev has stepped up efforts to resolve the dispute with Greece, which says the name Macedonia implies a territorial claim over its northern region which has the same name.\nGreece is also blocking Macedonia’s membership of NATO.\n“We have a concrete goal ahead of us. We have never been closer to receiving a date to open membership talks with the EU,” Zaev said after meeting Donald Tusk, head of the European Council which groups the bloc’s 28 national governments.\n“We are working to successfully solve the name issue. Solving this issue will open the doors to begin membership talks with the EU and to enter NATO.”\nHe said his administration would “double” its efforts to ensure that reforms are “more visible, concrete and efficient”.\nWestern governments see NATO and European Union membership for the Western Balkan countries as the best way to stabilize a region still recovering from armed conflicts in the 1990s.\nIn its latest report on progress of the six Western Balkan countries, the European Commission gave a recommendation for Albania and Macedonia to start accession talks. All member states have to give the green light for negotiations to begin.\nBut until the name issue is resolved, Greece is unlikely to give a green light to Macedonia’s accession talks.\nTusk was in Skopje for a meeting of regional heads of state, including the presidents of Croatia and Slovenia, the only two former Yugoslav republics so far to have joined the EU.\nReporting by Kole Casule; Writing by Ivana Sekularac; Editing by Gareth Jones\n ",
