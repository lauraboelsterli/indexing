Subscribe to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity for in-depth coverage on cybersecurity trends, breaches and best practices. Good morning, CIOs. The Internal Revenue Service, struggling to update badly out-of-date systems that were overwhelmed on tax day, is bringing in a CIO to oversee the effort. “A federal bill aimed at updating the Internal Revenue Service’s decades-old IT systems sets out the duties and responsibilities of a new IRS chief information officer, among other modernization efforts,” CIO Journal’s Angus Loten reports . IT systems currently are led by a CTO, who reports to the deputy IRS commissioner for operations support. Two deputy CIOs oversee IT operations and strategy.\nThe new CIO faces a big challenge. Rep. Suzan DelBene (D., Wash.) said as a former tech industry chief executive she was “astounded to learn that the IRS is still using fax equipment to conduct regular business and has IT systems still running from the 1960s.” Rep. DelBene held a number of roles at Microsoft Corp.\nDavid A. Powner, director of information technology management issues at the United States Government Accountability office, told CIO Journal last week that federal government IT modernization efforts often are thwarted by the short tenures of agency CIOs, who serve for just two years on average. Like many federal agencies, he added, the IRS is struggling with aging backend IT systems, tight budgets and pressure to offer better front-end services.\nSECURITY AND PRIVACY\nEmployees watch electronic boards monitoring possible cyberattacks at the Korea Internet & Security Agency in Seoul, South Korea, in May last year.

Yahoo Inc. ’s response–or rather, lack of response–to a 2014 hack of hundreds of millions of user accounts drew a $35 million fine from regulators Tuesday. It was the first time a public company has been penalized over its handling of a cybersecurity breach, says the WSJ’s Dave Michaels. The Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday that the company failed to properly investigate the breach and consider whether it should be disclosed to shareholders. Yahoo sold its core internet business to Verizon Communications Inc. in 2017 for about $4.5 billion, renaming what was left as Altaba Inc.\n‘Duel-hat’ leader of Cyber Command, NSA approved.

Google is rolling out a redesign to the Gmail web experience, its biggest change since 2011. New features include Confidential Mode, where senders can set a message to be deleted after a period of time, and Smart Reply, which provides three guesses as to what a sender might write back in response to an email. Says WSJ tech reviewer David Pierce : “In my tests, I found the new Gmail is remarkably more powerful, with overdue productivity and security enhancements.”\nGartner: AI to be $1.2 trillion in 2018.

Boeing Co. is enhancing software on current and future 787 jetliners to prevent electrical spikes generated by lightning storms from potentially disabling cockpit instruments, the Journal’s Andy Pasztor reports .
