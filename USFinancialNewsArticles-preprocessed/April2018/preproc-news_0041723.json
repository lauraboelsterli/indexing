    "text": "LAKEWOOD, Colo., April 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Solera National Bancorp, Inc. (OTC:SLRK) (“Company”), the holding company for Solera National Bank (“Bank”), a business-focused bank primarily serving the Denver metropolitan area, today reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 include:\nGross loan growth of $21.7 million, or 17% versus linked-quarter Noninterest-bearing deposit growth of $18.6 million, or 77% versus linked-quarter Net interest margin of 3.36% increased 32 basis points from same period last year Strong asset quality; no nonperforming assets and modest level of criticized assets Return on Average Assets and Return on Average Equity of 0.86% and 6.30%, respectively Commencement of rights offering; $3 million in capital raised through quarter-end Ranked 11 th Healthiest Bank out of 5,557 FDIC-insured banks in the United States (1)\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported net income of $400,000, or $0.15 per share, compared to a net loss of $279,000, or $0.10 per share, for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and net income of $200,000, or $0.07 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The fourth quarter of 2017 included a one-time income tax expense of approximately $610,000, or $0.22 per share, from revaluing the Company’s net deferred tax asset position as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted into law on December 22, 2017.\nMartin P. May, President and CEO, commented: “The Company is off to a strong start this year. We are particularly pleased with our solid loan and deposit growth. Net interest margin and other key profitability measures improved markedly versus the same quarter last year. The incremental capital from our rights offering will enable us to increase our legal lending limit, while exploring additional growth opportunities. Our balance sheet strength and the vibrant market we operate in give us reasons to be confident about the future.”\nMay continued, “We look forward to updating shareholders on our performance at the upcoming annual meeting which is scheduled for Wednesday, May 9th at 5:30 p.m. local time at the Company’s Lakewood, Colorado location. Shareholders of record as of March 26, 2018 will be entitled to attend and vote at the annual meeting.”\nOperational Highlights\nNet interest income after provision for loan and lease losses was $1.38 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $1.35 million and $1.10 million in the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively. The Company recorded provision for loan and lease losses of $68,000 in the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to no provision for loan and lease losses throughout 2017.\nThe Company's net interest margin in first quarter 2018 of 3.36% compared to 3.33% in the linked-quarter and 3.04% in the first quarter 2017. The increase in net interest margin compared to first quarter 2017 is attributed to higher loan portfolio yields, a shift in mix from lower yielding investment securities to higher yielding loans, along with significant growth in noninterest-bearing deposits.\nTotal noninterest income in first quarter 2018 was $62,000 compared to $58,000 in fourth quarter 2017 and $55,000 in first quarter 2017. Customer service and other fees increased versus the fourth quarter 2017 and first quarter 2017. The Company recorded no gains on loans sold or gains on sale of available-for-sale securities in first quarter 2018 or during 2017.\nTotal noninterest expense of $918,000 in first quarter 2018, essentially unchanged from $910,000 in the linked-quarter, increased $77,000, or 9%, from $841,000 in the first quarter of 2017. The increase from the prior year is principally due to higher employee compensation and benefits to support franchise growth along with expenses associated with the Company’s capital raise. The Company’s efficiency ratio (non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income FTE and non-interest income) for the first quarter of 2018 was 63.9% compared to 72.6% for the first quarter of 2017.\nIn first quarter 2018, the Company recorded income tax expense of $119,000 compared to income tax expense of $790,000 in the fourth quarter 2017 and income tax expense of $118,000 in the first quarter of 2017. The fourth quarter of 2017 included a one-time income tax expense of approximately $610,000 from revaluing the Company’s net deferred tax asset position as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nBalance Sheet Review and Asset Quality Strength\nTotal assets of $198.04 million at March 31, 2018 increased from $173.90 million at December 31, 2017 and $157.09 million at March 31, 2017. The increase versus March 31, 2017 was due to significant growth in gross loans.\nNet loans, after allowance for loan and lease losses, were $146.57 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $125.14 million at December 31, 2017 and $103.51 million at March 31, 2017. Net loan growth of $21.43 million during the first quarter of 2018 was driven by commercial loan originations of $13.18 million and a net increase of $9.28 million in student loans, partly offset by payoffs, pay downs and an increase in the allowance for loan losses totaling $1.03 million. The Company leveraged a portion of its excess capital by increasing its interest in the rehabilitated student loan pool, originally purchased in 2016, by approximately $10 million. Melissa K. Larkin, the Company’s Chief Financial Officer stated: “The student loan pool has performed as expected since our first purchase in the second quarter of 2016. They provide interest rate risk protection given their variable rate structure and limited credit risk given their government guarantee.”\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses at March 31, 2018 of $1.80 million, or 1.21% of gross loans, compared to $1.75 million, or 1.37% at December 31, 2017, and $1.60 million, or 1.52% of gross loans at March 31, 2017. The decline in the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of gross loans is primarily due to the growth in the student loan portfolio which contains minimal risk of loss given a U.S. government guarantee of approximately 97.5%.\nTotal investment securities available-for-sale were $31.71 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $31.95 million at December 31, 2017 and $34.65 million at March 31, 2017. Investment securities held-to-maturity of $4.90 million at March 31, 2018 were unchanged compared to December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017.\nTotal deposits at March 31, 2018 were $156.52 million compared to $137.51 million at December 31, 2017 and $128.04 million at March 31, 2017. The Company continued to make significant progress growing its core deposit franchise. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits of $42.68 million at March 31, 2018 increased $18.62 million, or 77%, versus the linked-quarter, and increased $34.0 million from $8.69 million at March 31, 2017. Mr. May commented, “We established a goal last year to substantially increase noninterest-bearing deposits. As a result of this focused effort, we identified a market opportunity which lead to a significant number of new relationships. I’m proud of our team and the superior customer service they deliver day in and day out.”\nThe Company continues to experience sound asset quality metrics. At March 31, 2018, the Company had no non-performing loans, non-performing assets or other real estate owned. Total criticized assets of $5.74 million at March 31, 2018, or 2.90% of total assets, increased slightly from the linked-quarter and has declined from $6.12 million, or 3.90% of total assets, at March 31, 2017.\nThe Company had no past due commercial loans as of March 31, 2018 and $133,000 from one past due residential mortgage loan. Additionally, $5.16 million of the student loan participation pool were 30 days+ past due at March 31, 2018, of which $3.01 million were 90 days+ past due. The student loans are backed by an approximately 97.5% guarantee of the U.S. Treasury under the Higher Education Act of 1965. This guarantee includes all principal and interest so net credit losses in this portfolio are expected to be minimal. Additionally, the Bank purchased the pool at a discount resulting in the Bank’s maximum exposure to credit losses slightly less than 1%.\nCapital Strength\nThe Company’s capital ratios continue to be well in excess of the highest required regulatory benchmark levels. As of March 31, 2018, the Bank’s Tier 1 leverage ratio was 14.8%, Tier 1 risk-based capital was 18.1%, and total risk-based capital was 19.4%.\nTangible book value per share, including accumulated other comprehensive income, was $8.52 at March 31, 2018, compared to $8.67 at December 31, 2017 and $8.52 at March 31, 2017. Total stockholders' equity was $26.98 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $23.83 million at December 31, 2017 and $23.40 million at March 31, 2017. Total stockholders' equity at March 31, 2018 included an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $573,000 compared to a loss of $243,000 at December 31, 2017 and a loss of $308,000 at March 31, 2017. The fair value of the Bank's available-for-sale investment portfolio has declined from a year ago due to an increase in interest rates.\nReferences\n(1) “How Healthy Is Your Bank?” DepositAccounts , by LendingTree LLC, 5 Apr. 2018, www.depositaccounts.com/banks/health.aspx .\nAbout Solera National Bancorp, Inc.\nSolera National Bancorp, Inc. was incorporated in 2006 to organize and serve as the holding company for Solera National Bank, which opened for business in September 2007.
