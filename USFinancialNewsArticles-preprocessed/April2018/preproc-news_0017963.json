    "text": "TORONTO, April 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Index Exchange today announced the promotion of executive team members as a result of rapid expansion and projected growth for 2018. The changes come at a time of unprecedented growth for the company as it looks to further establish its position as the leading independent global advertising exchange. Alex Gardner, former Senior Vice President, Partner Development, and long-time leader at Index, is elevated to Chief Revenue Officer. Gardner will oversee the now combined sales and services divisions and remain responsible for Index’s corporate revenue targets. Will Doherty will move from Vice President, Business Development to Senior Vice President, Global Marketplace Development to oversee strategy and execution for agency, marketer, and demand side platforms globally.\n“Index has experienced incredible momentum over the past year, and our new leadership structure strategically positions our team to meet and exceed the needs of publishers,” said Andrew Casale, President & CEO of Index Exchange. “Over 200 new employees will join us globally over the course of 2018, and these promotions will allow our team to provide greater global insight and the highest level of service. Alex and Will’s combined experience and breadth of knowledge will continue to positively impact our publisher and buyer partners along with the industry at large.”\nIn addition to the promotions of Gardner and Doherty, Index Exchange promoted James Prudhomme from Managing Director, EMEA, to Head of International where he’ll oversee successful scaling of Index operations outside of North America, including Index’s newest offices in Sydney and Dusseldorf. In this role, Prudhomme will expand his duties beyond Europe and support country managers and regional managing directors in Europe and APAC while sourcing and building channels of business in new markets.\n“I’ve had the pleasure of working with the entirety of Index’s executive team across borders over the past several years,” said Rich Caccappolo, Chief Operating Officer, MailOnline. “Index approaches programmatic advertising with a strategic and long lens, never rushing to produce a product or initiative without thoroughly vetting the idea both technically and commercially. I respect and trust the leadership team and look to them as a source of insight and ideas for MailOnline’s programmatic efforts. I’m excited to see them continue to expand into new horizons.”\nGardner, Doherty, Prudhomme along with the newly appointed sales and services leaders will oversee the success and growth of Index’s global publisher and buyer partnerships. They’ll also dedicate resources to the day-to-day education and strategic advisory for industry players looking to leverage the benefits of programmatic across a range of channels and locations.\nAbout Index Exchange\nIndex Exchange is a global advertising marketplace where premium digital media companies sell their ad impressions transparently and in real-time.
