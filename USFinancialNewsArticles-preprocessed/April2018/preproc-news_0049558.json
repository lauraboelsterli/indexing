    "text": "HOUSTON, April 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Luby's, Inc. (NYSE: LUB) (\"Luby's\") today announced unaudited financial results for its twelve-week second quarter fiscal 2018, which ended on March 14, 2018. Comparisons in this earnings release for the second quarter fiscal 2018 are referred to as \"second quarter.\"\nSecond Quarter Key Metrics\n(comparisons to second quarter fiscal 2017)\nTotal sales were $82.2 million, a decrease of 4.8% Same-store sales decreased 3.7% Culinary Contract Services sales increased $3.0 million; Opened three new locations in the second quarter Loss from continuing operations of $11.1 million in the second quarter compared to loss from continuing operations of $12.8 million in the second quarter fiscal 2017 Adjusted EBITDA decreased $5.3 million (see non-GAAP reconciliation below) Re-opened one company-owned Fuddruckers location that was restored after Hurricane Harvey and one new Fuddruckers franchise location opened (in Florida) in the second quarter\nChris Pappas, President and CEO, commented, \"In Culinary Contract Services we opened three new locations and sales increased $3.0 million compared to the second quarter last year. At our restaurant brands, we experienced a transitional quarter compared to the year ago quarter as we reduced the level of discounting and promotional activity while focusing on product quality and service. The change in the level of discounting led to a higher average price per guest, but a decrease in guest traffic in the quarter. We have since renewed our marketing and promotion plans to encourage guest frequency by delivering compelling value offerings, balanced with a pricing and discounting level that we expect will result in improved profit margins.\n\"We also made additional investments in our team members and in research and development during the quarter and our entire team across all of our business segments remains focused on enhancing our guests' experiences through superior service, excellent product quality and variety, and speed of service. In a very competitive restaurant market, we closely evaluate all of our restaurants to enhance performance and to identify underperforming locations. We continue to believe that our iconic restaurant brands remain well positioned for the long-term to enhance our financial performance.\"\nThe Company has entered into an amended credit facility which permits higher financial leverage in the short term, but shortens the loan maturity to May 1, 2019. We have identified approximately 9 owned properties, in addition to other properties previously identified as property held for sale or part of discontinued operations, that we plan to sell as part of a limited asset sales plan. These properties (totaling approximately 14 locations) are expected to be sold over the next 18 months and estimated proceeds of approximately $25 million will be used to accelerate repayment of the outstanding term loans totaling $25.2 million, as of April 23, 2018.\nThis limited asset sales plan, in conjunction with other operational changes, is designed to lower the outstanding debt and improve our financial condition as we pursue a new credit facility.\nSame-Store Sales Year-Over-Year Comparison\nQ1\n2018 (3)\nQ2\n2018 (3)\nYTD\n2018\nLuby's Cafeterias\n1.5%\n(1.8)%\n0.1%\nFuddruckers\n0.6%\n(6.4)%\n(2.5)%\nCombo locations (1)\n1.3%\n(5.4)%\n(1.5)%\nCheeseburger in Paradise\n(10.5)%\n(13.9)%\n(11.9)%\nTotal same-store sales (2)\n0.8%\n(3.7)%\n(1.1)%\n(1)\nCombo locations consist of a side-by-side Luby's Cafeteria and Fuddruckers Restaurant at one property location.\n(2)\nLuby's includes a restaurant's sales results into the same-store sales calculation in the quarter after that store has been open for six complete consecutive quarters. In the second quarter, there were 80 Luby's Cafeterias locations, 59 Fuddruckers locations, all six Combo locations, and all seven Cheeseburger in Paradise locations that met the definition of same-stores.\n(3)\nQ1 2018 and Q2 2018 same-store sales reflect the change in restaurant sales for the locations included in the same-store grouping for each of the comparable periods.\nSecond Quarter Restaurant Sales:\n($ thousands)\nRestaurant Brand\nQ2\n2018\nQ2\n2017\nChange\n($)\nChange\n(%)\nLuby's Cafeterias\n$\n47,261\n$\n49,975\n$\n(2,714)\n(5.4)%\nFuddruckers\n19,941\n22,860\n(2,919)\n(12.8)%\nCombo locations\n4,685\n4,951\n(266)\n(5.4)%\nCheeseburger in Paradise\n2,465\n3,278\n(813)\n(24.8)%\nTotal Restaurant Sales\n$\n74,352\n$\n81,064\n$\n(6,712)\n(8.3)%\nLuby's Cafeterias sales decreased $2.7 million versus the second quarter fiscal 2017, due to the closure of six locations over the prior year and a 1.8% decrease in Luby's same-store sales. The 1.8% decrease in same-store sales was the result of a 8.6% decrease in guest traffic, partially offset by a 7.5% increase in average spend per guest. Fuddruckers sales at company-owned restaurants decreased $2.9 million versus the second quarter fiscal 2017, due to eight restaurant closings (seven permanent closings and one temporary closing which we re-opened during the second quarter) and a 6.4% decrease in same-store sales. The 6.4% decrease in same-store sales was the result of a 11.8% decrease in guest traffic, partially offset by a 6.0% increase in average spend per guest. Combo location sales decreased $0.3 million, or 5.4%, versus second quarter fiscal 2017. Cheeseburger in Paradise sales decreased $0.8 million. The closure of one location in the first quarter fiscal 2018 reduced sales by $0.4 million and declines in sales at the remaining seven locations reduced sales by $0.4 million. Loss from continuing operations was $11.1 million, or a loss of $0.37 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $12.8 million, or a loss of $0.44 per diluted share, in the second quarter fiscal 2017. Excluding special non-cash items, loss from continuing operations was $5.2 million, or a loss of $0.17 per diluted share, in the second quarter compared to a loss of $2.1 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, in the second quarter fiscal 2017. Loss from continuing operations, excluding special items, is a non-GAAP measure, and reconciliation to loss from continuing operations is presented on page 10 of this release. Store level profit, defined as restaurant sales plus vending revenue less cost of food, payroll and related costs, other operating expenses, and occupancy costs, was $5.7 million, or 7.7% of restaurant sales, in the second quarter compared to $10.2 million, or 12.6% of restaurant sales, during the second quarter fiscal 2017. The decline in store level profit was primarily the result of the decline in same-store sales combined with increased investment in hourly labor, restaurant supplies, and repairs and maintenance. The decline in same-store sales was partially impacted by a significant reduction in menu item discounting and reduced promotional activity compared to the second quarter fiscal 2017. In addition, we accepted a reduced level of catering orders, re-directing focus on our restaurant teams excelling at core operations within the restaurant. Furthermore, sales were adversely impacted to a lesser extent by a disruption in our point of sale system functioning which also affected our volume of mobile ordering through third party channels. The increase in hourly labor was due in part to a concerted effort to reinvest in training programs as well as continue to increase the service level offered to our guests. The increase in restaurant supplies and repairs and maintenance was part of our program to refresh our stores in lieu of completing full remodels in the current fiscal year. Store level profit is a non-GAAP measure, and reconciliation to loss from continuing operations is presented after the financial statements. Culinary Contract Services revenues increased by $3.0 million to $6.3 million with 24 operating locations during the second quarter. New Culinary Contract Services locations and retail sales combined contributed approximately $3.7 million (primarily driven by the addition of one higher sales volume location) in revenue which was partially offset by a $0.5 million decrease in revenue from locations that ceased operations and an approximate $0.2 million decrease in revenue at locations continually operated over the prior full year. Culinary Contract Services profit margin decreased to 9.5% of Culinary Contract Services sales in the second quarter compared to 10.5% in the second quarter fiscal 2017. Franchise revenue decreased $418 thousand, or 23.0%, in the second quarter compared to the second quarter fiscal 2017. The decrease reflects 1) a $348 thousand decrease in non-royalty fee income mostly due to comparison to the second quarter fiscal 2017 when approximately $365 thousand in fee income was realized related to franchise development fees and franchise store openings and 2) a $71 thousand decrease in franchise royalty income. In the second quarter, one franchise location opened in Florida.\nBalance Sheet and Capital Expenditures\nWe ended the second quarter with a debt balance outstanding of $38.2 million (less deferred financing costs of $0.2 million), an increase from $31.0 million (less deferred financing costs of $0.3 million) at the end of fiscal 2017. During the second quarter, our capital expenditures increased to $3.7 million compared to $3.0 million in the second quarter fiscal 2017. At the end of the second quarter, we had $1.6 million in cash and $129.2 million in total shareholders' equity.\nRestaurant Counts:\nAugust 30,\n2017\nFY18\nYTDQ2\nOpenings\nFY18\nYTDQ2\nClosings\nMarch 14,\n2018\nLuby's Cafeterias (1)\n88\n—\n(2)\n86\nFuddruckers Restaurants (1)\n71\n—\n(4)\n67\nCheeseburger in Paradise\n8\n—\n(1)\n7\nTotal\n167\n—\n(7)\n160\n(1)\nIncludes 6 restaurants that are part of Combo locations\nConference Call\nLuby's will host a conference call on April 23, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Central Time to discuss further its second quarter fiscal 2018 results.

Rather, the Company believes that the presentation of income (loss) from continuing operations, before special items, provides additional information to investors to facilitate the comparison of past and present operations, excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of our ongoing operations due to their size and/or nature.\nReconciliation of loss from continuing operations to loss from continuing operations, before special items (1,2) :\nQ2 FY2018\nQ2 FY2017\nItem\nAmount\n($000s)\nPer Share\n($)\nAmount\n($000s)\nPer Share\n($)\nLoss from continuing operations\n$\n(11,074)\n$\n(0.37)\n$\n(12,836)\n$\n(0.44)\nProvision for asset impairments\n1,112\n0.04\n3,936\n0.13\nNet loss (gain) on disposition of property and equipment\n(161)\n(0.01)\n217\n0.01\nDeferred tax valuation allowance\n1,720\n0.06\n6,627\n0.22\nRevaluation of Deferred Tax asset related to changed federal statutory tax rates\n3,166\n0.11\n—\n—\nLoss from continuing operations, before special items\n$\n(5,237)\n$\n(0.17)\n$\n(2,056)\n$\n(0.07)\n(1)\nWe use income (loss) from continuing operations, before special items, in analyzing results, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. This information should be considered in addition to the results presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for the GAAP results. Luby's has reconciled loss from continuing operations, before special items, to loss from continuing operations, the nearest GAAP measure in context.\n(2)\nPer share amounts are per diluted share after tax (adjustments assume an effective 21% tax rate in second quarter fiscal 2018 and an effective 34% tax rate in second quarter fiscal 2017 )\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as income (loss) from continuing operations before interest, provision (benefit) for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, and excluding net loss (gain) on disposing of property and equipment, provision for asset impairments and restaurant closings, non-cash compensation expense, franchise taxes, and decrease / (increase) in fair value of derivatives.\nAdjusted EBITDA is intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to management and investors in valuing the Company and evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our results to other competitors. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA in evaluating management's performance when determining incentive compensation.\nAdjusted EBITDA, as defined, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures as computed by other companies. These measures should be considered supplemental and not a substitute or superior to other GAAP performance measures.\n($ thousands)\nQuarter Ended\nTwo Quarters Ended\nMarch 14,\n2018\nMarch 15,\n2017\nMarch 14,\n2018\nMarch 15,\n2017\n(12 weeks)\n(12 weeks)\n(28 weeks)\n(28 weeks)\nLoss from continuing operations\n$\n(11,074)\n$\n(12,836)\n$\n(15,941)\n$\n(18,350)\nDepreciation and amortization\n3,998\n4,788\n9,351\n11,338\nProvision for income taxes\n3,382\n3,603\n3,373\n2,145\nInterest expense\n545\n727\n1,194\n1,330\nInterest income\n(5)\n(1)\n(11)\n(3)\nNet loss (gain) on disposition of property and equipment\n(204)\n329\n18\n414\nProvision for asset impairments and restaurant closings\n1,407\n5,963\n2,252\n6,250\nNon-cash compensation expense\n291\n689\n848\n1,458\nFranchise taxes\n42\n42\n101\n97\nDecrease / (Increase) in Fair Value of Derivative\n(454)\n(46)\n(627)\n45\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n(2,072)\n$\n3,258\n$\n558\n$\n4,724\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lubys-reports-second-quarter-fiscal-2018-results-300634217.html\nSOURCE Luby's, Inc.",
