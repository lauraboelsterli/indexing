    "text": "COPPELL, Texas, April 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Costar Technologies, Inc. (the \"Company\") (OTC Markets Group: CSTI) announced today its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 that have been reviewed by the independent accounting firm BKD, LLP.\nFinancial Highlights for the Fourth Quarter and Year Ended December 31, 2017\nRecord revenue of $44,266, an increase of $5,706 or 14.8% from the year ended December 31, 2016. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 was up approximately $3,500 or 37% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. GAAP net loss of ($371) or ($0.25) per share based on 1,513 fully diluted shares outstanding, compared to GAAP net income of $634 or $0.41 per share based on 1,541 fully diluted shares for the year ended December 31, 2106. The primary driver of the GAAP net loss in 2017 was approximately $2,700 in income tax expense relating to the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax asset under the new tax legislation effective in 2018. Adjusted earnings of $1,837 or $1.21 per diluted share compared to $1,586 or $1.03 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase per share of 17.5%. The Company defines adjusted earnings, a non-GAAP measure, as net income excluding stock-based compensation, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, adjustments to the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration, transaction related expenses and the income tax effect relating to the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax asset. Adjusted EBITDA of $3,731 compared to $2,040 for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 82.9%. The Company defines adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, transaction and related expenses and adjustments to the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration. Cash flow from operations of $2,805 for the 2017 year, allowing the Company to pay the balance on its line of credit and make additional payments on its long term debt.\nBusiness Highlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nCohuHD launched the new RISE 4290, a dual-head thermal and visual camera which secured a $2,400 order of which $2,200 was included in revenue during the fourth quarter of 2017. CohuHD's RISE 4290 has been awarded the 2017 GSN Airport, Seaport, Border Security Award for Best Long-Range/High-Res Camera by Government Security News. The Company made several long-term investments in its business including a new IT infrastructure and the successful implementation of NetSuite, a new ERP system, bringing all three of the Company's locations onto the same platform and providing enhanced analytics, efficiency and security.\nJames Pritchett, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated, \"In 2013, two customers accounted for more than 60% of our revenue, prompting us to set a goal to reduce revenue reliance through acquisition and organic growth. I am pleased to announce that we have substantially achieved that goal in 2017 where our two largest customers accounted for only 19% of our total revenue. The acquisition of Innotech in late 2016 and the increase in revenue generated by the CohuHD business segment provide improved earnings quality for the Company and our investors. In 2017, we delivered record revenue and continued margin improvement. We also received our largest single order with the new RISE 4290 camera. With our refreshed product portfolio, expanded retail markets and share gains in the transportation market, we anticipate ongoing revenue and earnings growth in the future.\"\nThe Company reevaluated its deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2017 in relation to the new tax regulations effective in 2018. See Footnote 9 in the Company's consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017 for further information.\nThe Company's outside independent auditors completed their analysis of the Company's financial condition.
