Soccer Football - Ligue 1 - Olympique Lyonnais v FC Nantes - Groupama Stadium, Lyon, France - April 28, 2018 Lyon's Nabil Fekir in action REUTERS/Emmanuel Foudrot\nDutchman Memphis Depay scored the first goal, his seventh in the last six league games, and set up the second as Lyon moved above AS Monaco who were held 0-0 at home by Amiens.\nDepay broke the deadlock five minutes before halftime with a superb strike as he collected Nabil Fekirâ€™s pass on the edge of the penalty area, moved the ball to his left foot and scored with a low drive.\nBertrand Traore slotted home the second midway through the second half after Depay beat two defenders before slipping the ball to the Burkinabe forward. Slideshow (9 Images)\nThe top two teams qualify for the Champions League next season and third place earns a spot in the qualifying rounds.\nLyon have 72 points from 35 games with Monaco on 71 and Olympique de Marseille, who visit Angers on Sunday, fourth with 69. Paris St Germain have already wrapped up the title.\nMaverick forward Mario Balotelli converted a second-half penalty to give sixth-placed Nice a 1-1 draw at Strasbourg.
