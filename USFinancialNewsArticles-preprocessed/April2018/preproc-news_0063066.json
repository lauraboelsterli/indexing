    "text": "April 30, 2018 / 2:12 AM / Updated 15 hours ago With warning drums and river clean-ups, Indonesian women head off disasters Michael Taylor 6 Min Read\nYOGYAKARTA, Indonesia (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Whenever heavy rains come at night in her neighborhood in the ancient Indonesian city of Yogyakarta, schoolteacher Muryani remembers the worst floods she experienced, almost 35 years ago. Muryani, a resident of Pedak Baru in Yogyakarta, poses outside her family home, April 22, 2018, Thomson Reuters Foundation/Michael Taylor\nSleeping with her mother and two young siblings in a bamboo hut to guard a farmer’s goats from thieves, Muryani feared for their lives as flash floods burst through the door.\n“Suddenly the water was so high ... it came very fast,” she said. “I was so worried about my mother, who was already quite old. I was afraid we would drown.”\nMuryani, 44, who goes by one name only, still lives in the same area, now a small settlement of about 300 residents called Pedak Baru which sits by a river close to Mount Merapi volcano.\nAs floods have become more frequent over the last five years, Muryani and 25 other local women have teamed up with the YAKKUM Emergency Unit, a project that runs activities to help women protect their communities from disasters in Central Java and Yogyakarta.\nLocated along the Pacific Rim of Fire, Indonesia has more than 17,000 islands, and faces many natural threats, including earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions.\nThe effects of climate change, such as worsening floods and drought, present further risks.\nThe Indonesian government spends an estimated $300 million-$500 million annually on building back after disasters, according to World Bank resilience officials.\nWhile the Southeast Asian nation has reduced poverty over the last 20 years, many hover just above the poverty line and can easily be pushed back under it by a disaster.\nBut women can play a crucial role in minimizing the risks for their families and neighbors, experts say.\nFor Muryani and her family, regular floods have often destroyed their possessions and furniture - which she cannot afford to replace - and forced her two children to miss school.\nBut the disaster training she has received is helping.\n“It gives us an awareness for what to do when flooding happens and how to prepare,” she said. Participants of the YAKKUM resilience project pose by the river in Pedak Baru, a small settlement near Mount Merapi volcano in Yogyakarta, April 22, 2018, Thomson Reuters Foundation/Michael Taylor POLICY CHANGE\nIndonesia has experienced an average of 290 significant natural disasters annually over the past 30 years, according to the World Bank officials.\nThey include the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that killed about 167,000 Indonesians. After that shock, Jakarta reformed its institutions, laws and policies to better manage disaster risk.\nThe government introduced a disaster management bill in 2007 that shifted the emphasis from merely responding to disasters toward trying to stop them happening and curbing their impact.\nThe new approach led to the strengthening of Indonesia’s disaster management agency, with representatives and branches put in place across districts.\nThe disaster agency now encourages civil society groups like YAKKUM to involve women more in efforts to build resilience.\nDespite the huge progress made in recent years, more work is needed, and a larger number of government departments should include disaster risk reduction in their projects, especially at the local level, said Arghya Sinha Roy of the ADB in Manila.\n“Every disaster is not on a nationwide scale - it can be a localized district or village-level disaster,” he added. WOMEN LEFT BEHIND\nOften marrying early, Indonesian women’s traditional role in running the household means they are sometimes forgotten when a community draws up plans to deal with disasters.\nThis can lead to them being left behind at home during evacuations, or being unaware of safety procedures.\n“When you look back at the 2004 tsunami, most of the casualties are women,” said Irina Rafliana, a researcher at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences.\nAnd women who survive a major catastrophe are often the ones responsible for getting their families back on their feet in tough circumstances, she added. Slideshow (3 Images)\nIn Indonesia, as in many Asian countries, women often take care of the family and its finances, meaning they are best placed to suggest ways of protecting lives, property and incomes, experts said.\nWhen disasters happen, women tend to quickly grasp the importance of saving key documents, for example.\nAnd because women spend more time in their neighborhoods, they can pinpoint high-risk areas and influence their peers.\n“If you compare Indonesia with other countries in Southeast Asia, the role of women ... in disaster risk reduction is among the strongest,” said Rafliana. FLOODS AND VOLCANOES\nPedak Baru faces twin threats of flooding and damage to infrastructure caused by eruptions from nearby Mount Merapi.\nThe only access to the settlement is via a narrow, potholed road, while many of its two-storey houses are in a state of disrepair due to regular inundations.\nThings are changing, however, especially since YAKKUM began working with women in the community three years ago.\nPedak Baru’s women first mapped out their neighborhood to identify the risks, and now regularly collect rubbish from the river, recycling plastic waste for money.\nThe women are trained in evacuation procedures and first aid, and help fill and place sandbags along the river’s embankment when waters rise.\nDespite scant funding, they have made life-buoys from rope and tyres, and early-warning drums from bamboo.\nSignposts on walls point out escape routes and an evacuation point positioned on higher ground.\nThe women also hold regular talks with the local branch of the Indonesian disaster agency, and are campaigning for the permanent reinforcement of their river embankment.\nPedak Baru resident Farida Estiningrum, 39, said the scheme had been useful in helping young people too.\n“We have even trained the children on how to save themselves when the flood comes to the houses,” she said. “We are prepared for everything.” Reporting by Michael Taylor, Editing by Megan Rowling.
