Revenues increased 12.8% primarily due to the increase in volume described above as well as an increase in the average price of cement. Net income of S/29.8 million, a 37.3% increase mainly due to higher sales and operating profit. Consolidated EBITDA of S/94.3 million; a 14.4% increase compared to 1Q17. Cement EBITDA margin of 30.0%. Excluding one-off expenses related to the repair of La Niña highway, Cement EBITDA margin would have been 31.6%.
