    "text": "April 14, 2018 / 5:36 PM / Updated an hour ago CSKA dismiss Reuters report on racial abuse at Arsenal match in Moscow Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nMOSCOW (Reuters) - CSKA Moscow on Saturday dismissed a Reuters report that their fans had chanted racist abuse at Arsenal’s black players during a Europa League quarter-final match on Thursday. \nA Reuters photographer at the game, which ended in a 2-2 draw, heard dozens of home supporters make monkey chants at Arsenal’s Danny Welbeck and Alex Iwobi when they neared a particular section of the stands as the ball went out of play. \nOn Saturday, an individual at Arsenal indicated that the club had not made a complaint about racial abuse. \nThe chants were repeated when Welbeck celebrated his 75th-minute goal, which brought Arsenal back into the game from 2-0 down. \nA third Arsenal player who did not come off the substitute’s bench was targeted with the same chants after the final whistle as he jogged to warm down on the pitch at the CSKA Arena. The player, who Reuters was unable to identify, was also black. \nCSKA, who did not respond to requests for comment on Friday, said in a statement on Saturday that they were “outraged” by what they called a “slanderous” report. \n“The match, which will be remembered for its bright soccer, was held in an excellent atmosphere,” the CSKA statement said, characterising the report as a “cheap provocation”. \nReuters stood by its story, a company spokesperson said. \nWelbeck and Iwobi did not reply to messages sent to their verified Instagram accounts. \nRussia has pledged to crack down on racism in sport as it faces increased scrutiny before it hosts the soccer World Cup from June 14 to July 15. \nUEFA told Reuters on Friday that no racist behaviour had been reported to it by match officials at the game. \nHowever, UEFA said it had opened disciplinary proceedings against CSKA for infractions, including throwing objects and setting off fireworks, that were not connected to racist or discriminatory behaviour. \n“UEFA opened the case, not us,” CSKA spokesman Sergei Aksyonov said on Saturday. “There were no fireworks, and as for the objects, there were only papers carried by the wind.” \nArsenal’s draw with CSKA saw them reach the Europa League semi-finals 6-3 on aggregate after a 4-1 win in the first leg. They face Spanish club Atletico Madrid in the last four. Reporting by Gabrielle Tétrault-Farber; Editing by Angus MacSwan and Kevin Liffey",
