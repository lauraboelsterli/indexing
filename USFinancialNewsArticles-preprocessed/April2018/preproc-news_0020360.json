    "text": "(Reuters) - The planned detonation of a silo in southern Denmark went spectacularly wrong on Friday when the silo fell in the opposite direction intended.\nNobody was injured as the 53-metre (170-foot) silo at Vordingborg Harbour fell, but it damaged a small section of an adjacent library.\nThe blast had been prepared for six months and an investigation has begun into what went wrong.\nVordingborgâ€™s mayor, Mikael Smed, told the Ritzau news agency that dust and glass would need to be cleared up from the damaged area and a structural assessment of the damaged building carried out.\nWriting by Ilze Filks and Mark Hanrahan, editing by Larry King\n ",
