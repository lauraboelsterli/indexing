NIM excluding accretion income improves to 4.14% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 3.96% for the fourth quarter of 2017 Loan originations of $65.5 million and lease originations of $21.8 million Loans were $2.3 billion as of March 31, 2018, an increase of $2.9 million over the fourth quarter of 2017, and $136.9 million over the first quarter of 2017 Originated loans and leases grew to $1.6 billion as of March 31, 2018, an increase of $45.4 million from the fourth quarter of 2017, and $302.9 million from first quarter of 2017 Total deposits were stable at $2.5 billion and core deposits were 85.3% of total deposits Received regulatory and stockholder approval for the First Evanston Bancorp, Inc. acquisition\nCHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Byline Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”)(NYSE: BY), the parent company of Byline Bank (the “Bank”), today reported net income of $6.8 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared with a net loss of $766,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, and net income of $6.6 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017.\n“Our first quarter results reflect solid growth in net interest income and an expanding net interest margin, offset by higher credit costs primarily related to a single commercial relationship,” said Alberto J. Paracchini, President and Chief Executive Officer of Byline Bancorp, Inc. “We continue to see solid loan growth in our originated portfolio, driven by strong increases in the commercial and industrial and construction portfolios, although payoffs and seasonal fluctuations moderated our overall net loan growth in the quarter. Our loan pipeline remains healthy, which we believe will result in higher levels of loan growth later in 2018.\n“We continually evaluate all areas of the organization for opportunities to increase efficiencies. We have identified six branch and two other facilities within our current network that we believe can be consolidated with minimal impact on our customer service levels, convenience, and business development capabilities. We anticipate these consolidations to occur during June 2018. We estimate that the consolidations will result in approximately $1.4 million in one-time charges and approximately $2.0 million in annual cost savings that will be re-invested over time into our infrastructure.\n“Completing the First Evanston Bancorp, Inc. acquisition and ensuring a smooth transition for customers and colleagues remains our top priority for 2018. To that end, we have received all required approvals and expect the transaction to close by the end of May 2018. The addition of First Evanston will solidify our position as the largest community bank in Chicago under $10 billion in assets and we believe sets forth a strong foundation for continued growth,” said Mr. Paracchini.\nSTATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nNet Interest Income\nThe following table presents net interest income for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, (dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME\nInterest and fees on loans and leases\n$ 33,654 $ 31,896 $ 30,933 $ 29,181 $ 28,396 Interest on taxable securities 4,055 3,679 3,720 3,703 3,790 Interest on tax-exempt securities 174 176 174 151 133 Other interest and dividend income\n259 205 217 280 169 Total interest and dividend income\n38,142 35,956 35,044 33,315 32,488 INTEREST EXPENSE Deposits 2,498 2,218 2,112 1,923 1,483 Federal Home Loan Bank advances 1,358 1,009 850 772 660 Subordinated debentures and other borrowings\n591 578 670 809 807 Total interest expense 4,447 3,805 3,632 3,504 2,950 Net interest income $ 33,695 $ 32,151 $ 31,412 $ 29,811 $ 29,538 The following table presents the quarter-to-date schedule of average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities for the periods indicated:\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, December 31, 2018 2017 (dollars in thousands) Average Balance (5)\nInterest Inc / Exp\nAverage Yield /\nRate\nAverage Balance (5)\nInterest Inc / Exp\nAverage Yield /\nRate\nASSETS Cash and cash equivalents $ 38,490 $ 80 0.85 % $ 38,908 $ 74 0.75 % Loans and leases (1) 2,275,274 33,654 6.00 % 2,233,863 31,896 5.66 % Securities available-for-sale 628,879 3,623 2.34 % 588,482 3,166 2.13 % Securities held-to-maturity 101,834 611 2.43 % 106,367 644 2.40 % Tax-exempt securities (2) 27,480 174 2.57 % 27,504 176 2.55 % Total interest-earning assets $ 3,071,957 $ 38,142 5.04 % $ 2,995,124 $ 35,956 4.76 % Allowance for loan and lease losses (17,360 ) (16,844 ) All other assets 307,474 325,393 TOTAL ASSETS $ 3,362,071 $ 3,303,673 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nDeposits Interest checking $ 186,686 $ 38 0.08 % $ 188,457 $ 31 0.07 % Money market accounts 345,545 370 0.43 % 384,864 344 0.35 % Savings 436,935 76 0.07 % 436,916 78 0.07 % Time deposits 733,753 2,014 1.11 % 709,044 1,765 0.99 % Total interest-bearing deposits\n1,702,919 2,498 0.59 % 1,719,281 2,218 0.51 % Federal Home Loan Bank advances 363,540 1,358 1.52 % 261,888 1,009 1.53 % Other borrowed funds 56,471 591 4.25 % 58,794 578 3.90 % Total borrowings 420,011 1,949 1.88 % 320,682 1,587 1.96 % Total interest-bearing liabilities $ 2,122,930 $ 4,447 0.85 % $ 2,039,963 $ 3,805 0.74 % Non-interest bearing demand deposits 743,827 767,985 Other liabilities 35,779 32,424 Total stockholders’ equity 459,535 463,301 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\n$ 3,362,071 $ 3,303,673 Net interest spread (3) 4.19 % 4.02 % Net interest income $ 33,695 $ 32,151 Net interest margin (4) 4.45 % 4.26 % Net loan accretion impact on margin $ 2,336 0.31 % $ 2,301 0.30 % Net interest margin excluding loan accretion (6)\n4.14 % 3.96 % (1) Loan and lease balances are net of deferred origination fees and costs and initial indirect costs.

See “Reconciliation of non-GAAP Financial Measures” for a reconciliation of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Net interest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $33.7 million, an increase of $1.5 million, or 4.8%, from $32.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe increase in net interest income was primarily due to:\nAn increase of $1.8 million in interest and fees on loans and leases, primarily due to the increase in average yield on loans and leases of 24 basis points to 6.00% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 5.66% for the fourth quarter of 2017; and An increase of $374,000 in interest income on securities, primarily due to additional purchases during the quarter.\nPartially offset by:\nAn increase of $349,000 in interest expense on Federal Home Loan Bank advances, primarily due to an increase in advances outstanding during the quarter; and An increase of $280,000 in interest expense on deposits, primarily due to increases in time deposits resulting from promotions during the quarter.\nNet interest margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 4.45%, an increase of 19 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017. The net interest margin increase was primarily driven by the increased loan and lease yields during the quarter. Total net loan accretion on acquired loans contributed 31 basis points to the net interest margin for the first quarter of 2018 and 30 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2017. Net interest margin excluding loan accretion expanded 18 basis points to 4.14% during the first quarter of 2018, compared to 3.96% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe cost of average total deposits was 0.41% for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of six basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017 due to slightly higher rates on interest bearing deposits, growth in average time deposits of $24.7 million, and a decrease in average non-interest bearing demand deposits of $24.2 million.\nProvision for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe provision for loan and lease losses was $5.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $1.8 million compared to $3.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The first quarter provision included allocations of $1.0 million for acquired non-impaired loans, $3.7 million for originated loans and leases and a $451,000 provision for acquired impaired loans. The increased provision during the first quarter of 2018 was mainly due to an increase in a specific reserve on a commercial loan relationship, slight credit deterioration in the government guaranteed acquired non-credit impaired portfolio, and an increase to the general reserve driven by new loan originations.\nNon-interest Income\nThe following table presents the components of non-interest income for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, (dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 NON-INTEREST INCOME Fees and service charges on deposits\n$ 1,312 $ 1,304 $ 1,418 $ 1,348 $ 1,219 Net servicing fees 563 704 959 1,076 919 ATM and interchange fees 1,218 1,498 1,495 1,499 1,348 Net gains on sales of securities available-for-sale\n— — — — 8 Net gains on sales of loans 7,476 9,036 7,499 8,445 8,082 Other non-interest income 859 97 547 825 732 Total non-interest income $ 11,428 $ 12,639 $ 11,918 $ 13,193 $ 12,308 Non-interest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $11.4 million, a decrease of $1.2 million from $12.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe decrease in total non-interest income was primarily due to:\nA decrease of $1.6 million in net gains on sales of loans, primarily due to lower volumes of loans sold; A decrease of $280,000 in ATM and interchange fees, primarily due to the revision of our assessment schedule; and A decrease of $141,000 in net servicing fees, primarily due to the change in fair value of the servicing asset as a result of increases in prepayment speed assumptions on government guaranteed loans.\nPartially offset by:\nAn increase of $762,000 in other non-interest income, primarily due to a $189,000 gain on sale of an asset held for sale during the first quarter of 2018, compared to a $384,000 loss on sale of assets held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company sold $78.6 million of government guaranteed loans compared to $87.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, contributing to the decrease in net gains on sale of loans for the quarter.\nNon-interest Expense\nThe following table presents the components of non-interest expense for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, (dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 NON-INTEREST EXPENSE Salaries and employee benefits $ 18,278 $ 17,118 $ 16,323 $ 17,226 $ 16,602 Occupancy expense, net 3,755 3,553 3,301 3,485 3,739 Equipment expense 603 663 630 616 563 Loan and lease related expenses 1,400 1,116 891 801 877 Legal, audit and other professional fees 1,851 2,658 1,608 1,090 1,671 Data processing 2,301 2,284 2,399 2,447 2,409 Net (gain) loss recognized on other real estate owned and other related expenses\n(1 ) (430 ) 565 141 (570 ) Regulatory assessments 241 299 326 384 184 Other intangible assets amortization expense 767 767 769 769 769 Advertising and promotions 249 232 196 318 289 Telecommunications 418 428 351 396 418 Other non-interest expense 2,057 1,670 3,706 1,576 1,900 Total non-interest expense $ 31,919 $ 30,358 $ 31,065 $ 29,249 $ 28,851 Non-interest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $31.9 million, an increase of $1.6 million from $30.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe increase in total non-interest expense was primarily due to:\nAn increase of $1.2 million in salaries and employee benefits, primarily due to merit increases, organizational growth, higher payroll taxes, and increased employer costs related to benefits; A decrease of $429,000 in net gain recognized on other real estate owned and other related expenses, primarily due to a decreased number of sales of other real estate owned properties during the quarter; An increase of $387,000 in other non-interest expense, primarily due to a $223,000 increase in the reserve for unfunded loan commitments; and An increase of $284,000 in loan and lease related expenses, primarily due to further loan originations during the quarter.\nPartially offset by:\nA decrease of $807,000 in legal, audit and other professional fees, primarily due to professional services incurred related to the First Evanston Bancorp, Inc. acquisition compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe Company’s efficiency ratio was 69.04% for the first quarter of 2018, compared with 66.06% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $1.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, an effective tax rate of 16.3%, compared to $11.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, a decrease of $10.5 million. The decrease was primarily due to the “H.R. 1”, commonly known as the “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” which President Donald Trump signed into law on December 22, 2017. Among other items, the law reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the new 21% corporate federal tax rate, the Company expects its effective tax rate for 2018 to be approximately 27% to 29%.\nAlso on December 22, 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance on accounting for the Tax Act’s impact. SAB 118 provides a measurement period, not to extend beyond one year from the date of enactment during which a company, acting in good faith, may complete the accounting for the impacts of the Tax Act. At March 31, 2018, the Company’s accounting for the impact of the Tax Act on its net deferred tax assets is based upon reasonable estimates of the tax effects of the Tax Act; however, these estimates may change as additional information and interpretive guidance regarding the provisions of the Tax Act become available. As a result of the rate change, the Company’s net deferred tax assets were required to be revalued during the period in which the new legislation was enacted, and we recorded net income tax expense of $7.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2017, and net income tax benefit of $724,000 during the first quarter of 2018.\nSTATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nTotal assets were $3.5 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $96.2 million from $3.4 billion at December 31, 2017, and an increase of $177.7 million compared to $3.3 billion at March 31, 2017.\nThe increase was primarily due to:\nAn increase in interest bearing deposits with other banks of $71.7 million, primarily due to an increase in deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank at March 31, 2018, due to timing of public funds returning on the last day of the quarter;

The increase was partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $4.9 million, from $42.6 million at December 31, 2017 to $37.7 million at March 31, 2018, primarily due to loan purchases not yet settled of $9.8 million during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nStockholders’ Equity\nTotal stockholders’ equity was $462.9 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of $4.4 million from $458.6 million at December 31, 2017, and an increase of $70.9 million from $389.7 million at March 31, 2017.\nThe following table presents the actual regulatory capital dollar amounts and ratios of the Company and Byline Bank as of March 31, 2018:\nActual\nMinimum Capital Required\nRequired for the Bank to be Considered\nWell Capitalized\nMarch 31, 2018 Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Total capital to risk weighted assets: Company $ 415,805 16.05 % $ 207,254 8.00 % N/A N/A Bank 372,267 14.34 % 207,608 8.00 % $ 259,510 10.00 % Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets: Company $ 396,406 15.30 % $ 155,440 6.00 % N/A N/A Bank 352,868 13.60 % 155,706 6.00 % $ 207,608 8.00 % Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) to risk weighted assets:\nCompany $ 349,468 13.49 % $ 116,580 4.50 % N/A N/A Bank 352,868 13.60 % 116,780 4.50 % $ 168,682 6.50 % Tier 1 capital to average assets: Company $ 396,406 12.14 % $ 130,626 4.00 % N/A N/A Bank 352,868 10.79 % 130,845 4.00 % $ 163,557 5.00 % Capital ratios for the period presented are based on the Basel III regulatory capital framework as applied to the Company’s current business and operations, and are subject to, among other things, completion and filing of the Company’s regulatory reports and ongoing regulatory review and implementation guidance.\nConference Call, Webcast and Slide Presentation\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast at 9:00 a.m. Central Time (10:00 a.m. Eastern Time) on Friday, April 27, 2018 to discuss its quarterly financial results.

These measures include adjusted net income, non-interest income to total revenues, pre-tax pre-provision return on average assets, tangible book value per share, tangible common equity to tangible assets, and net interest margin excluding loan accretion. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP; however, management acknowledges that our non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. As such, these disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP financial measures that we and other companies use. Management also uses these measures for peer comparison. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” in the financial schedules included in this press release for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures.\nAdjusted net income and earnings per share exclude certain significant items, which include dividends on preferred shares, incremental income tax benefit related to Illinois corporate income tax rate increase, incremental income tax expense or benefit related to federal corporate income tax reduction, impairment charges on assets held for sale, and merger related expense, adjusted for applicable income tax. Management believes the significant items are not indicative of or useful to measure the Company’s operating performance on an ongoing basis.\nNon-interest income to total revenues is non-interest income divided by net interest income plus non-interest income. Management believes that it is standard practice in the industry to present non-interest income as a percentage of total revenue. Accordingly, management believes providing these measures may be useful for peer comparison.\nPre-tax pre-provision income is pre-tax income plus the provision for loan and lease losses. Management believes this metric is important due to the tax benefit resulting from the reversal of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, the decrease in the federal corporate income tax rate, and the increase in the Illinois state corporate income tax rate.\nPre-tax pre-provision return on average assets is pre-tax income plus the provision for loan and lease losses, divided by average assets. Management believes this metric is important due to the change in tax expense or benefit resulting from the decrease in the federal corporate income tax rate and the increase in the Illinois state income tax rate. The ratio demonstrates profitability excluding the tax provision or benefit and excludes the provision for loan and lease losses.\nTangible common equity is defined as total stockholders’ equity reduced by preferred stock and goodwill and other intangible assets. Management does not consider servicing assets as an intangible asset for purposes of this calculation.\nTangible assets is defined as total assets reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets. Management does not consider servicing assets as an intangible asset for purposes of this calculation.\nTangible book value per share is calculated as tangible common equity, which is stockholders’ equity reduced by preferred stock and goodwill and other intangible assets, divided by total shares of common stock outstanding. Management believes this metric is important due to the relative changes in the book value per share exclusive of changes in intangible assets.\nTangible common equity to tangible assets is calculated as tangible common equity divided by tangible assets, which is total assets reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets. Management believes this measure is important to investors and analysts interested in relative changes in the ratio of total stockholders’ equity to total assets, each exclusive of changes in intangible assets.\nNet interest margin excluding loan accretion is calculated as reported net interest margin less the effect of accretion income net of contractual interest collected on acquired loans. Management believes that this metric is important as it illustrates the impact of net accretion income from acquired loans on the net interest margin.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis communication contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws.
