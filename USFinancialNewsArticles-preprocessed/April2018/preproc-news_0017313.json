    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia is able to complete the construction of Turkey’s Akkuyu nuclear power plant even if it is unable to attract other investors, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said.\nConstruction site of the Akkuyu Nuclear Power Plant is seen during the groundbreaking ceremony in Mersin, Turkey April 3, 2018. Depo Photos via REUTERS “Already, $3 billion has been invested... If they won’t find an investor, it means that the plant will be built by Akkuyu Nuclear,” Novak said, referring to a company owned by the Russian state nuclear company Rosatom.\nRussian firm Rosatom has been seeking investors for a 49 percent stake in the Akkuyu nuclear power plant project.\nThe project is planned to be financed by Rosatom and its partners involving loans from export-import agencies and banks.\nReporting by Anastasia Lyrchikova, Olesya Astakhova and Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Katya Golubkova\n ",
