    "text": "83 COMMENTS The National Enquirer’s parent company, American Media Inc., has said the tabloid’s plentiful and positive coverage of President Donald Trump has been good for business.\nIf so, it hasn’t been enough to boost the company’s overall performance.\nNonpublic AMI financial reports reviewed by The Wall Street Journal reveal a company with ballooning debt, falling revenue and shrinking newsstand sales at its print magazines, including the flagship Enquirer as well as OK! and Star.\nRevenue for the fiscal year that ended in March 2017 was $203.8 million, down 9% from the prior year and 29% from 2014, when the company completed a substantial restructuring. Its outstanding debt load stood at $920 million at the end of December. Acquisitions of Us Weekly and Men’s Journal in 2017 helped increase revenue in the first three quarters of fiscal 2018 to $195.5 million, from $154 million in the year-earlier period, but they also added more than $100 million in debt. \nAggressive cost-cutting has kept AMI hovering around profitability on an operating basis, but the company has routinely booked quarterly and annual losses in the tens of millions of dollars due to amortization costs related to its debt, the financial reports show.\nAMI Chief Executive David Pecker has sought to turn the company around, in part by pursuing acquisitions. Earlier this year, the company bid $325 million to acquire several former Time Inc. publications from Meredith Corp. , but was rejected, according to people familiar with the matter. The move was partly aimed at bolstering AMI’s digital strategy, the people said.\nAMI isn’t alone in struggling as younger readers shift away from print. The decline in newsstand sales the company has experienced is in line with its competitors. \nMr. Pecker, a longtime friend of the president, threw the full weight of his supermarket tabloid behind Mr. Trump, especially during the 2016 election and its aftermath. Nearly a third of National Enquirer’s 122 covers since the beginning of 2016 have featured Mr. Trump or an attack on one of his opponents, with headlines like “Trump Must Build the Wall!”\nThe Anti-Hillary Effect National Enquirer editions with covers featuring President Trump have performed in line with regular celebrity covers, while anti-Hillary Clinton covers during election season outperformed.

But Enquirer editions with Mr. Trump on the cover have sold roughly on par with those featuring celebrities during 2016 and 2017, though covers attacking his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton were especially hot sellers, according to circulation data that AMI provides to the Alliance for Audited Media.\nThe Enquirer’s editor in chief, Dylan Howard, said from June 2016 to Election Day, the tabloid’s overall circulation was up 3% for issues that featured Mr. Trump, citing the company’s internal data. \n“Our coverage of President Trump is and always has been a business decision—one in keeping with how the Enquirer has conducted business since the 1970s,” he said.\nAMI is facing potential complications stemming from payments it made to acquire stories that could be damaging to Mr. Trump and that it never ran. The Journal first reported in 2016 , for example, that AMI had paid former Playboy model Karen McDougal $150,000 for her story alleging an affair with Mr. Trump in 2006, but never published it. \nIntentionally burying such a story is called “catch and kill” in the tabloid world. The Enquirer has said it declined to publish certain stories because it couldn’t verify that they were true. The White House has denied the affair.\nOn Wednesday, AMI reached a settlement with Ms. McDougal releasing her from her nondisclosure agreement and allowing her to tell her story publicly.\nFederal prosecutors are investigating Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, who people familiar with the matter say discussed the payments with the Enquirer. AMI has also become the target of a complaint filed with the Federal Election Commission by a government watchdog, Common Cause, into whether the payments violated campaign-finance laws.\nWith respect to the federal probe, the company has said it would continue to comply with requests that don’t violate its sources or materials according to the First Amendment. It has called the FEC complaint “meritless” and an “unprecedented attack on a media company by an organization that purports to value free speech.”\nAMI’s business woes stretch back several years. The company declared bankruptcy in 2010 and underwent a restructuring in 2014 that handed control to its two biggest creditors, Chatham Asset Management LLC and hedge-fund manager Leon Cooperman. Chatham owns 80% of the company, with Messrs. Cooperman and Pecker holding 10% each.\nChatham executives and Mr. Cooperman referred inquiries to AMI.\nDebt on AMI’s balance sheet has nearly doubled from the $513 million it was carrying after the 2014 restructuring, in part because of its complex deals with creditors. Company officials say the debt load is manageable because only about $225 million of it—held largely by outside lenders including Apollo Investment Corp.—needs to be serviced now.\nThe rest of the notes, almost all of which are held by AMI’s owners, don’t come due until 2022. Those notes are significantly discounted, with the company receiving just 50 cents in cash for every dollar accrued as zero coupon debt. \nAMI executives also note that the company’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization have remained strong, at $71 million in the 2017 fiscal year, down from $94.7 million in 2014. In its December quarterly report, the company said it would owe just under $50 million in interest and principal payments on its debt.\nIn 2016 and 2017, Mr. Pecker explored acquiring Time Inc. or some of its properties, hoping to boost AMI’s online business and capitalize on its brand to expand in podcasting, television production and events, people familiar with the matter said. Meredith eventually bought the publisher.\nMr. Pecker’s offer to Meredith earlier this year, first reported by Vanity Fair, was for Time Inc. weeklies including TIME magazine, Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money, the people said. Meredith rejected the offer, but has since put those titles on the block . AMI said in March it no longer had any interest in acquiring any former Time Inc. brands.\nTo finance the potential deals, Mr. Pecker has engaged in talks with financiers in Saudi Arabia on and off, although no deal was reached, people familiar with the matter said. In one instance, Mr. Pecker invited a Saudi-connected businessman to the White House for an Oval Office tour in July 2017 along with the Enquirer’s Mr. Howard, during which they met with the president.\nA White House official said that Mr. Trump recalled the Oval Office meeting with Mr. Pecker and others and that he called the AMI CEO a “great guy.”\nThe company confirmed the contacts but said the only deal that has ever been discussed with Saudi investors is the expansion of the Mr. Olympia bodybuilding competition, which AMI owns, into the Middle East and North Africa.\n—Jeffrey A.
