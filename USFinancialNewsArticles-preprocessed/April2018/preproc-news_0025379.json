    "text": "17 COMMENTS Syrians reacted with a mix of defiance and disappointment to early-morning missile strikes from the U.S., U.K. and France , demonstrating how divided the country has become over seven long years of civil war.\nAntiaircraft tracers lit up the skies over Damascus and explosive sounds bounced off the city’s hills, mixing with the mosques’ calls to prayer. Journalists in Damascus reported loud explosions shaking the capital for nearly an hour before falling quiet shortly before dawn.\nU.S. officials said the strikes were limited to destroying President Bashar al-Assad’s chemical-weapons capabilities, a week after a suspected regime attack with chlorine and a nerve agent killed more than 40 people in Douma .\nU.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called the Saturday strikes a “one-time shot.”\nStrikes on Syria Beginning at 9 p.m ET, U.S., British and French forces struck three targets associated with chemical weapons in Syria: Areas of control\nRussia/Iran/Syrian regime\nSyrian Kurds\nIslamic State\nOpposition/Turkey\nOpposition\n50 miles\nTURKEY\n50 km\nAfrin\nHasakah\nAleppo\nRaqqa\nIdlib\nDeir Ezzour\n3\n2\nSYRIA\nHoms\nPalmyra\nLEB.\nDamascus\nDouma\nIRAQ\nSite of\nsuspected\nchemical\nattack\n1\nJORD.\nGreater Damascus area: Chemical weapons cientific research center\n1\nArea west of Homs: Chemical-weapons storage site and command post\n3\n2\nSources: Institute for the Study of War (control areas as of April 2); Defense Department (strike locations)\nSome Syrians said they were upset to see that the strikes were limited and weren’t likely to change the course of war.\n“There were more statements than missiles in the last week,” Mazer, a Syrian Facebook user commented.\nOthers feared the regime would retaliate and let Syrian civilians pay the price. “People of Idlib, be ready. The regime and the Russians will respond here in Idlib,” Mohammad al-Salloum, an antiregime activist in the northern city, said on Facebook.\nSyria’s state and pro-regime media early Saturday claimed its air defense systems had repelled the strikes by shooting down 13 incoming missiles. State media reported that life is normal in Damascus and posted photos from around the country of people at vegetable stalls and walking at a racetrack.\nIn a show of defiance following the attack, regime supporters took to the streets of the capital and danced while singing songs praising Mr. Assad.\nState media acknowledged that a research center north of Damascus was hit and laboratories and a building used for teaching had been destroyed, but claimed no casualties were sustained.\nMedia allied with the regime often play down any negative news, while independent verification is difficult in the areas controlled the government.\nIt wasn’t immediately clear how widespread the strikes were and what damage they caused on the ground.\nPresident Donald Trump said the recent suspected chemical attack in Syria was the crime of a “monster” and the strikes aim to deter the production and use of chemical weapons. Photo: AP Initial reports suggested more than 100 missiles were launched, about twice as many as the U.S. launched last year on a Syrian air base in response to a chemical-weapons attack by the Assad regime.\nThis latest operation was more targeted to facilities connected with Syria’s chemical weapons program rather than its military. The Pentagon said the strikes will set back Syria’s chemical weapons program for years.\nSuch focused strikes will likely do little to affect Assad government forces from continuing with its deadliest form of warfare: airstrikes from its numerous military bases. Those regime attacks—with rockets launched from airplanes and barrel bombs dropped from helicopters—have killed the vast majority of people in the civil war.\nThough the use of chemical weapons has provoked the most significant international condemnation, they have killed fewer than 2,000 people in a conflict that has left more than 400,000 dead.",
