    "text": "BERLIN, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday that the European Union should seek to negotiate a modern free trade agreement with New Zealand.\n“We should have close relations between the European Union and New Zealand, especially in terms of trade, and we should aim for a modern free trade agreement that includes issues of social elements, climate protection, biodiversity and sustainability,” Merkel told a news conference.\nVisiting New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said a free trade agreement with the EU would be an “opportunity to send a clear signal that not only does rules-based trade benefit us all but there is an opportunity to show our respective citizens the benefits that can develop from solid agreements”.
