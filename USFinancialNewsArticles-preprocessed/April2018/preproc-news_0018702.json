    "text": "NEW YORK, April 11 (Reuters) - Wall Street fell on Wednesday as possible U.S. military action against Syria stoked investor concerns about geopolitical risks and minutes from the latest Federal Reserve meeting sparked worries about a more hawkish view on interest rate increases.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 218.62 points, or 0.9 percent, to 24,189.38, the S&P 500 lost 14.68 points, or 0.55 percent, to 2,642.19 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 25.28 points, or 0.36 percent, to 7,069.03.
