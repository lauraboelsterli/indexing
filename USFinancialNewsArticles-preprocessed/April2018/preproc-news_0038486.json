    "text": "STOCKHOLM, April 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The operations show strong growth and are currently expected to generate quarterly sales of approximately EUR 200,000, with an operating margin of approximately 75%. About 75% of the revenues are generated via revenue sharing.\n\"I am very pleased that we have the opportunity to strengthen our position in the DACH region. This is an exciting market which we consider to have good growth opportunities ahead. In addition, completion of this transaction will give us further opportunities to grow our existing operations in the region, and expand these assets to other markets,\" comments Marcus Teilman, CEO of Net Gaming.\nThe acquisition of the operations is expected to take place after completion of a due diligence process. The initial purchase consideration of EUR 2.29 million will be settled with existing cash resources. Payment of a maximum additional consideration of EUR 1.25 million may also be required.
