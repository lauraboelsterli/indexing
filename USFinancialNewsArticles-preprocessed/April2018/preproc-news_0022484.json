Great benefits and perks also don’t hurt. To compile this list, Fortune partner Great Place to Work interviewed thousands of staffers about their jobs. Below, the top companies in both industries that get the highest marks for work/life balance, and whose employees actually love coming to work.\nRead more about how companies create cultures that land them on this list.\nTop Heath Care Companies to Work For 1. Texas Health Resources Courtesy of Texas Health Resources Headquarters: Arlington, Texas\nNumber of U.S. employees: 21,686\nCompany type: Non-Profit\nEmployees say:\n“I appreciate that everyone at the table is encouraged to speak up and offer a perspective. I like that our leaders subscribe to a ‘best idea wins’ mentality rather than relying only on leaders for input and guidance.”\n“The teamwork on my unit and a few others that I have experience with are unmatched. I have worked here for a year and still love coming to work because I feel supported and love my coworkers. You can’t find that everywhere. I’m also a student and I have felt welcomed with many encouraging my education through words of affirmation and learning opportunities in the clinical setting. I couldn’t imagine working anywhere else.”\n2. Encompass Home Health And Hospice Headquarters: Dallas, Texas\nNumber of U.S. employees: 8,453\nCompany type: Private\nEmployees say:\n“What makes this a great place to work for me is feeling like management actually cares about me as a person. I have been made to feel like part of a team. Everyone does their share and helps each other when necessary.”\n“I am very new here, just over 2 months. From day one there has been an abundance of help, from the people in the office that I work with daily to preceptors who have been sent in to help the new hires. I can honestly say no other company I have ever worked for has gone the extra mile like Encompass has. I look forward to a very long and rewarding career here.”\n3. Southern Ohio Medical Center Courtesy of Southern Ohio Medical Center Headquarters: Portsmouth, Ohio\nNumber of U.S. employees: 2,586\nCompany type: Non-Profit\nEmployees say:\n“I have always been encouraged to take steps to improve myself and to grow within the organization. I have been offered assistance to obtain a higher level of education and support in doing so.”\n“SOMC is a great place to work, mainly because of the attitudes of everyone here. If you pass someone in the hallway, they will smile or say hi. Everyone is usually willing to help a customer find their way, or help in any way possible. I feel like most everyone who works here strives to provide excellent care. When you care about your patients and feel like you have provided them excellent service, it gives purpose to your work and really helps you have a great attitude about having to come to work here every day. I personally feel that way myself, and you can look around at other employees and its obvious many others here feel the same way that I do.”\n4. Caring Nurses Headquarters: Las Vegas, Nevada\nNumber of U.S. employees: 103\nCompany type: Private\nEmployees say:\n“Caring goes beyond a name. I have seen management pay to assist patients with medications, to clean their homes, and buy food for them. We started a food pantry so any of our field staff is welcome to come take food to our patients.”\n“I’ve worked for multiple home health agencies but Caring Nurses is my favorite. I love that we have the stock program and get statements every year on how well the company is doing. It makes you feel like you are on the winning team. I’ve seen the owners do a lot of pro-bono stuff for patients who don’t have money for meds or food and it’s heartwarming to work for people who care about more than just profit.”\n5. Scripps Health Headquarters: San Diego, California\nNumber of U.S. employees: 14,496\nCompany type: Non-Profit\nEmployees say:\n“Our CEO is approachable and listens to questions from all employees. We are kept informed regarding changes in our industry. The management approach is proactive rather than reactive to any changes that the organization needs to make.”\n“Scripps does a wonderful job of selecting talent that mirrors the organization’s mission. This makes it easier to work with your fellow colleagues because they go beyond their job description to ensure the best result for the patient, program, or overall outcome for the organization. There is a sense of pride the employees have that stems from the synergy from one another which makes you automatically feel a part of the Scripps family. Chris Van Gorder is an excellent leader as he is very inclusive and egalitarian in his leadership which makes everyone feel special regardless of their role. You automatically sense that he would roll up his sleeves and get dirty just to get the job done. He also believes in leadership rounding which is something I wish more of the C-level executives would emulate as that further makes employees feel valued.”\n6. Jackson Healthcare Headquarters: Alpharetta, Georgia\nNumber of U.S. employees: 1,208\nCompany type: Private\nEmployees say:\n“The difference is night and day from other places I’ve worked. From the minute you walk in the door here, you can feel the positive energy. The benefits and support Jackson Healthcare provides have enabled me to discover and nurture my true talents.”\n“The atmosphere and culture of the company is the most unique of any company I’ve ever experienced. It is a very family-oriented company that encourages everyone to improve the lives of everyone they touch, both in and outside of the company. Giving back is a huge part of the company culture and is one of the main things that drew me to the company in the first place. Not only do I feel like the company really cares about each employee, but they also do a great job of showing their appreciation by providing great amenities.”\n7. Baptist Health South Florida Courtesy of Baptist Health South Florida Headquarters: Coral Gables, Florida\nNumber of U.S. employees: 16,210\nCompany type: Non-Profit\nEmployees say:\n“The organization is very transparent from the CEO down. They make their expectations clear and will provide support and guidance for you to succeed. There is always an opportunity to grow and advance if you are willing to take the challenge.”\n“Leaders take the time to listen to employees’ concerns and respond appropriately with actions. There is a great focus on creating a workforce that is engaged and is able to contribute to its community. At the end of the day, our leaders care that we are able to do a good job and provide great care to our patients. Healthcare is not an easy industry to be in these days, but we have done remarkably well in weathering the storm by staying ahead of the game and strategizing to remain financially stable, while staying focused on our core values.”\n8. Atlantic Health System Headquarters: Morristown, New Jersey\nNumber of U.S. employees: 12,183\nCompany type: Non-Profit\nEmployees say:\n“You are appreciated, educated, and rewarded in many ways. As such, employees are loyal and committed. The values of the company maintain a leading organization in medicine with the highest quality and standard of healthcare in our communities.”\n“I have worked here for 31 years, and plan to stay here through retirement. I have had incredible opportunities to learn, grow, and develop personally and professionally. I truly feel that I make a difference in my work, relationships, and opportunities to mentor my staff each and every day. In a hospital setting, any given day can be the worst day of someone’s life who may be dealing with an unexpected diagnosis, a critical loved one, or an end-of-life situation. Although we may not be able to change the outcome, each of us have the opportunity to make that experience easier and that memory better for a family through our caring and support.”\n9. St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital Headquarters: Memphis, Tennessee\nNumber of U.S. employees: 4,355\nCompany type: Non-Profit\nEmployees say:\n“St. Jude does an excellent job making sure everyone knows how important their job is to the institution. Working in the executive branch is not ‘better’ than working as a cashier. Everyone contributes to the mission.”\n“They listen to employee suggestions and implement as many as are feasible (bike share, umbrella sharing, mobile app, butterfly/hummingbird garden, to mention a few of the employee suggestions that have been implemented). The top executive has monthly Town Hall meetings to which all employees are invited. Employees can vote on topics to be discussed at the Town Hall ahead of time online. HR examines our benefit package periodically and makes it competitive and attractive to potential employees. We have a nice fitness center on campus and they emphasize work/life balance for all employees.”\n10. BayCare Health System Courtesy of Baycare Health System Headquarters: Clearwater, Florida\nNumber of U.S. employees: 23,459\nCompany type: Non-Profit\nEmployees say:\n“There is a lot of longevity here at BayCare which means and says a lot. The fact that you can learn and move to different positions is great and you are encouraged to better yourself. BayCare also helps out the communities in which we are located.”\n“The opportunities for advancement are amazing. I have worked as a tech and Baycare is helping me pay for nursing school. On top of that, fellow employees and doctors love to teach and help me get better for when I am a nurse. On top of that, the culture that we develop of trying to work like a family sometimes comes across really well. I love telling people where I work.”\n11. Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare Headquarters: Memphis, Tennessee\nNumber of U.S. employees: 11,402\nCompany type: Non-Profit\nEmployees say:\n“Le Bonheur truly has strong culture which offers mutual support, promotes trust, rewards associates’ efforts, and ensures that we know their work is meaningful. Le Bonheur’s executive team continually asks how I’d like to see my career unfold.”\n“MLH cares for the well being of all of its patients and employees. Their first priority is every patient that walks through its doors. It provides top-quality healthcare and a clean environment for each patient. It also provides healthcare for the ones in our community who would not seek out medical attention due to financial and/or transportation issues. This type of behavior is also shown to its employees. It provides a great amount of opportunities for employees to receive help for education (employee and family members), financial issues, healthier lifestyles, and emotional stress that an employee might be under due to home life or work, plus much more. I left another healthcare facility to join Methodist LeBonhuer Hospitals and do not regret a single moment.”\n12. Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta Courtesy of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Headquarters: Atlanta, Georgia\nNumber of U.S. employees: 9,090\nCompany type: Non-Profit\nEmployees say:\n“Our culture recognizes the significant importance of our patients to their families and this frequently drives the decisions we make in caring for them. We grant families a huge amount of decision making power into the care of their child. I have seen this company go beyond the basics by providing therapy dogs not only for patients, but also for staff which can truly help make a day brighter and happier. They provide resiliency retreats and pay you while there for you to be able to take time for yourself since our work environment can be very stressful. They are very aware of the stresses on nurses and don’t understaff units or ask nurses to take assignments that are not safe.”\n13. Northwell Health Headquarters: New Hyde Park, New York\nNumber of U.S. employees: 52,007\nCompany type: Non-Profit\nEmployees say:\n“Everybody is always willing to go an extra mile which I find admirable and encouraging. I’ve seen nothing but camaraderie from every one as a unit and team. The managers are always willing to assist with anything that is needed to accomplish goals.”\n“Northwell truly invests in its employees, and they offer employees many opportunities to grow, whether it is through the classes they offer at their Corporate University, or through the tuition reimbursement they offer for employees to continue their education and receive a degree. They also provide their employees with many different and unique healthcare resources to improve their wellness by partnering with various outside organizations. For example, at the Northwell Health Center for Wellness and Integrative Medicine, employees have access to different offerings, including yoga, Pilates, acupuncture, and meditation. Northwell invests in its employees mentally, physically, and academically, and that is what makes this organization a great place to work.”\n14. Signature HealthCARE Headquarters: Louisville, Kentucky\nNumber of U.S. employees: 18,000\nCompany type: Private\nEmployees say:\n“They are always celebrating the achievements and milestones of stakeholders and the contributions they provide as well as their backgrounds and the experiences that have impacted them.”\n“The vision from the CEO/President to have a ‘servant leader’ mentality is what makes this organization so different from the rest. All stakeholders are treated with respect and supported in a way to learn and grow, not in a punitive or degrading way. The pillars of our organization allow us to stay focused on what matters, which is the elders that we serve, the stakeholders that we employ, and the family members and communities in which we reside. I am empowered to make a difference every day and to always do what is right!”\n15. Kettering Health Network Headquarters: Miamisburg, Ohio\nNumber of U.S. employees: 10,464\nCompany type: Non-Profit\nEmployees say:\n“We are committed to providing better access to quality healthcare in our community. There is a lot of growth in this organization and there will be many potential opportunities for career advancement within this organization as I grow in my care.”\n“Management makes every effort to keep employees informed of changes, accomplishments, and areas that need improvement. They are quick to celebrate when it’s warranted and very generous in those celebrations. The President has an open door policy and truly cares about the employees. He strives to improve the work environment and to help us grow as an organization.”\n16. Kaiser Permanente Headquarters: Oakland, California\nNumber of U.S. employees: 190,125\nCompany type: Non-Profit\nEmployees say:\n“The collaboration and team mentality is strong, and I truly feel like my career matters to my managers and colleagues. Everyone makes an effort to boost each other up. The company provides opportunities to enhance your career and do your job efficiently.”\n“Kaiser Permanente is really committed to ensuring that its employees thrive, and it puts a lot of resources into providing opportunities for this to happen both at work and for employees at home. Additionally, Kaiser maintains a strong commitment to the surrounding communities—we have so many innovative programs and community benefit projects that are ensuring that our communities are healthy and thriving, too. There aren’t many organizations that will allow you to volunteer during paid work hours. That’s really something special and something that makes me proud to work for Kaiser.”\n17. Licking Memorial Health Systems Headquarters: Newark, Ohio\nNumber of U.S. employees: 1,989\nCompany type: Non-Profit\nEmployees say:\n“I love working for an organization whose mission is to improve the health of the community. I like knowing that what I do impacts my friends and neighbors, but what makes it a great place to work is the way it shows its appreciation to its employees.”\n“There is a feeling of team work and personal responsibility which I admire. I see it at all levels, including in the administration. Another great feature is the fact that for a smaller community hospital, we are proactive in staying up-to-date with new technology, and in observing current guidelines for practicing medicine.”\n18. OhioHealth Courtesy of Ohio Health Headquarters: Columbus, Ohio\nNumber of U.S. employees: 22,920\nCompany type: Non-Profit\nEmployees say:\n“OhioHealth values the dignity and worth of each person, both the associates and patients, and this is demonstrated by decisions and actions made from leadership, to middle management to front-line staff.”\n“The culture at OhioHealth is one of strength, support, compassion, and excellence. The team works together to care for our associates and serve our community well. The leadership team here understands the work, the challenges, the dynamics, and the vision.

Benco Dental Headquarters: Pittston, Pennsylvania\nNumber of U.S. employees: 1,500\nCompany type: Private partnership\nEmployees say:\n“Direct access to top-level management for questions or concerns about anything at any given time. Instead of jumping through hoops to get a question answered, management is always there to help with anything.”\n“This company provides resources to improve your health by offering programs to promote a healthy lifestyle. They provide various opportunities to develop yourself personally and professionally through offering various learning and development programs. They are extremely active in the surrounding community. They have emergency funds for employees in need, just to name a few. In addition, I’m provided adequate guidance and the owners make a concerted effort to ensure employees know where the company stands and where it’s going. They take the time to answer questions from the employees and show appreciation for the employees.”\n20.

It’s a wonderful experience to be able to work where so many people of different backgrounds get along so well.”\n22.

We know why and believe in what we do. There are many great professions, but ours is truly inspiring and humbling.

I love working with such a true variety of people with very different views, backgrounds, and ideas. I can be myself and not be concerned about presenting dissenting ideas.
