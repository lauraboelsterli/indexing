    "text": "April 3 (Reuters) - British software firm Fidessa, which has been in takeover talks with Swiss banking software supplier Temenos, said on Tuesday it was approached by two separate undisclosed buyers.\nOne of the possible offers would give Fidessa shareholders 38.297 pounds per share, representing a 5 percent premium to Temenosâ€™ cash offer to buy Fidessa for 1.4 billion pounds ($1.97 billion) or 36.467 pounds per share.\nThe latest offer at 38.297 pounds would value Fidessa at 1.48 billion pounds, according to Reuters calculation.\nThe company did not disclose any details on the second offer.
