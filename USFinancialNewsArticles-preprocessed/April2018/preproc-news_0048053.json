    "text": "SANTA CLARA, Calif., April 24, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nInphi Corporation (NYSE:IPHI), a leader in high-speed data movement interconnects, today announced financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nGAAP Results\nRevenue was $60.1 million on a U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, down 35.7% year-over-year, compared with $93.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was due to lower demand for linear transimpedance amplifier and linear driver products.\nGross margin under GAAP was 54.1%, compared with 57.2% in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a change in the product mix.\nGAAP operating loss was $28.0 million or (46.5%) of revenue, compared to GAAP operating loss in the first quarter of 2017 of $4.5 million or (4.8%) of revenue. The loss was mainly due to lower revenue.\nGAAP net loss was $23.0 million or ($0.53) per diluted common share, compared with GAAP net loss of $11.3 million or ($0.27) per diluted common share in the first quarter of 2017. In the first quarter of 2018 we recorded a tax benefit of $8.3 million primarily due to partial release of valuation allowance.\nInphi reports revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, net income (loss), and earnings per share in accordance with GAAP and on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, net income, earnings per share, as well as a description of the items excluded from the non-GAAP calculations, is included in the financial statements portion of this press release.\nNon-GAAP Results\nGross margin on a non-GAAP basis was 66.4%, compared with 71.3% in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was due to change in product mix.\nNon-GAAP operating loss was $2.1 million, compared with operating income of $21.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease is primarily due to lower revenue.\nNon-GAAP net loss was $2.0 million, or ($0.05) per diluted common share. This compares with non-GAAP net income of $19.5 million, or $0.44 per diluted common share in the first quarter of 2017.\n“As our guidance for Q2 shows, we believe ​Q1 ​represented the bottom of a down cycle driven by inventory buildups in China long-haul and metro markets. We met our Q1 guidance on revenue and EPS, and guided for 15 percent sequential revenue growth in Q2, while guiding up for Q2 EPS,” said Ford Tamer, President and CEO of Inphi. “Our product innovation continues. We unveiled our newest 400G PAM DSP at the recent Optical Fiber Conference (OFC), along with our 56Gbaud linear TiA and driver. We look forward to a growing presence in the data center, resulting in a continued diversification of our business, which we expect to help drive our growth in the second half of 2018 and beyond.”\nBusiness Outlook\nThe following statements are based on the company’s current expectations for the second quarter of 2018. These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially. A reconciliation between the GAAP and Non-GAAP outlook is included at the end of this press release.\nRevenue in Q2 2018 is expected to be in a range of $67.3 million to $71.3 million. The midpoint being $69.3 million. GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 56.5% to 58.1%. Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 67.8% to 68.8%. Stock-based compensation expense is expected to be in the range of $16.5 million to $17.1 million. GAAP results are expected to be a net loss in a range between $23.7 million to $24.3 million, or ($0.54) – ($0.56) per basic share, based on 43.763 million estimated weighted average basic shares outstanding. Non-GAAP net income, excluding stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles and inventory step up fair value related to acquisitions and noncash interest on convertible debt, is expected to be in the range of $5.3 million to $6.1 million, or $0.12 - $0.14 per weighted average diluted share, based on 44.992 million estimated weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nQuarterly Conference Call Today\nInphi plans to hold a conference call today at 5 p.m. Eastern Time / 2 p.m. Pacific Time with Ford Tamer, president and chief executive officer, and John Edmunds, chief financial officer, to discuss the first quarter 2018 results.\nThe call can be accessed by dialing (765) 507-2591, participant passcode: 1067179.

These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with GAAP. These results should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Company believes that its non-GAAP financial information provides useful information to management and investors regarding financial and business trends relating to its financial condition and results of operations because it excludes charges or benefits that management considers to be outside of the Company’s core operating results. The Company believes that the non-GAAP measures of gross margin, income from operations, net income and earnings per share, in combination with the Company’s financial results calculated in accordance with GAAP, provide investors with additional perspective and a more meaningful understanding of the Company’s ongoing operating performance. In addition, the Company’s management uses these non-GAAP measures to review and assess the financial performance of the Company, to determine executive officer incentive compensation and to plan and forecast performance in future periods. The Company’s non-GAAP measurements are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and are not an alternative to GAAP financial information, and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP financial information disclosed by other companies.\nRECONCILIATION OF GAAP NET INCOME TO NON-GAAP NET INCOME (in thousands of dollars, except share and per share amounts) (Unaudited) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 GAAP gross margin to Non-GAAP gross margin GAAP gross margin $ 32,546 $ 53,513 Adjustments to GAAP gross margin: Stock-based compensation 569 (a) 561 (a) Acquisition related expenses 11 (b) 59 (b) Amortization of inventory step-up - 5,317 (c) Amortization of intangibles 6,699 (d) 7,250 (d) Depreciation on step-up values of fixed assets (14 ) (e) 16 (e) Restructuring expenses 105 (f) - Non-GAAP gross margin $ 39,916 $ 66,716 GAAP operating expenses to Non-GAAP operating expenses GAAP research and development $ 42,938 $ 40,288 Adjustments to GAAP research and development: Stock-based compensation (8,498 ) (a) (5,915 ) (a) Acquisition related expenses (305 ) (b) (670 ) (b) Depreciation on step-up values of fixed assets (133 ) (e) (154 ) (e) Restructuring expenses (885 ) (f) - Non-GAAP research and development $ 33,117 $ 33,549 GAAP sales and marketing $ 11,342 $ 10,941 Adjustments to GAAP sales and marketing: Stock-based compensation (3,242 ) (a) (1,682 ) (a) Acquisition related expenses (142 ) (b) (235 ) (b) Amortization of intangibles (2,431 ) (d) (2,431 ) (d) Depreciation on step-up values of fixed assets (23 ) (e) (29 ) (e) Restructuring expenses (359 ) (f) - Non-GAAP sales and marketing $ 5,145 $ 6,564 GAAP general and administrative $ 6,218 $ 6,795 Adjustments to GAAP general and administrative: Stock-based compensation (2,244 ) (a) (1,072 ) (a) Acquisition related expenses (3 ) (b) (722 ) (b) Amortization of intangibles (116 ) (d) (116 ) (d) Depreciation on step-up values of fixed assets 41 (e) 69 (e) Restructuring expenses (133 ) (f) - Non-GAAP general and administrative $ 3,763 $ 4,954 Non-GAAP total operating expenses $ 42,025 $ 45,067 Non-GAAP income (loss) from operations $ (2,109 ) $ 21,649 GAAP net loss to Non-GAAP net income GAAP net loss $ (22,991 ) $ (11,273 ) Adjusting items to GAAP net loss: Operating expenses related to stock-based compensation expense 14,553 (a) 9,230 (a) Acquisition related expenses 461 (b) 1,685 (b) Amortization of inventory fair value step-up - 5,317 (c) Amortization of intangibles related to purchase price 9,246 (d) 9,797 (d) Depreciation on step-up values of fixed assets 101 (e) 131 (e) Restructuring expenses 1,482 (f) - Loss on retirement of certain property and equipment from ClariPhy acquisition - 44 (g) Accretion and amortization expense on convertible debt 6,330 (h) 5,895 (h) Unrealized gain on equity investment (3,022 ) (i) - Valuation allowance and tax effect of the adjustments above from GAAP to non-GAAP (8,130 ) (j) (1,277 ) (j) Non-GAAP net income (loss) $ (1,970 ) $ 19,549 Shares used in computing non-GAAP basic earnings per share 42,998,819 41,570,629 Shares used in computing non-GAAP diluted earnings per share\nbefore offsetting shares from call option 42,998,819 45,685,636 Offsetting shares from call option - 802,021 Shares used in computing non-GAAP diluted earnings per share 42,998,819 44,883,615 Non-GAAP earnings per share: Basic $ (0.05 ) $ 0.47 Diluted $ (0.05 ) $ 0.44 GAAP gross margin as a % of revenue 54.1 % 57.2 % Stock-based compensation 0.9 % 0.6 % Amortization of inventory fair value step-up and intangibles 11.4 % 13.5 % Non-GAAP gross margin as a % of revenue 66.4 % 71.3 %\n(a) Reflects the stock-based compensation expense recorded relating to stock based awards.
