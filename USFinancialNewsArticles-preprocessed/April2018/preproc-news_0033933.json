The record revenue was a result of a $2.1 million increase in product sales coupled with a $375,000 increase in services revenue. The revenue gains were mainly attributable to the Company's acquisition of Virtual Surveillance, LLC and ApexCCTV, LLC., two Texas-based video security and surveillance companies.\nGross Profit and Margin: Gross profit rose to $1.3 million in 2017, a 450% increase compared to gross profit of $229,000 in 2016. Product sales accounted for 98% of gross profit dollars compared to 76% in 2016. Gross margin percentage was 43.4% in 2017 compared to 49.8% in 2016.\nOperating Expenses: Operating expenses in 2017 increased by 30.9% to $2.1 million compared to $1.6 million in 2016. The increase in operating expenses is mainly attributed to a $326,000 increase in compensation and taxes, a $146,000 increase in amortization, and a $127,000 increase in depreciation, partially offset by a $100,000 decrease in debt expense and a $50,000 decrease in marketing and public relations expenses.\nLoss from Operations: The Company's operating loss narrowed to $(873,000) in 2017 compared to an operating loss of $(1.4) million in 2016. Net loss attributable to DirectView shareholders in 2017 narrowed by $3.2 million to $(1.6 million) or $(0.22) per share on 6.98 million weighted average shares outstanding compared to a net loss of $(6.7 million) or $(16.95) per share on 280,943 weighted average shares outstanding.\n\"We are pleased to have achieved record revenue and gross profit in 2017 as well as a significant improvement in our overall operating results,\" said Roger Ralston, CEO of DirectView. \"We have successfully integrated our Virtual Surveillance, LLC and ApexCCTV, LLC into our operations and are poised to achieve continued improvement in our performance in the years to come.\"\n\"As we move through 2018, our entire team will work diligently to continue driving sales growth while managing expenses to achieve future profitability and build lasting value for our stockholders.\"\nAbout DirectView Holdings, Inc.\nDirectView Holdings, Inc., (DIRV) together with its subsidiaries, provides video surveillance solutions and teleconferencing products and services to businesses and organizations.
