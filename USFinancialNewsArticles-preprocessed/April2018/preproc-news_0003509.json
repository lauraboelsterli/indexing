    "text": "0 COMMENTS Disney DIS 0.77% has put the contest for pay-TV leader Sky on a more even playing field. Investors are right to expect healthy bidding from 21st Century Fox FOX -0.25% and Comcast . CMCSA 0.42% \nFox submitted Tuesday two new “remedies” to the U.K. antitrust watchdog, which in January raised concerns that its bid for full control of Sky would weaken the “plurality” of the local media landscape. \nUnder the first remedy, Fox would give operational independence and 15 years of guaranteed funding to the broadcaster’s news arm, Sky News; under the second, Disney, which in December mounted a bid for Fox, would acquire Sky News.\nIf the first remedy doesn’t cut it, the second should. It makes clear that Disney now stands behind the bid for Sky . \nSky shares rose Tuesday to £13.25, 6% ahead of Comcast’s informal offer. Photo: Chris Radburn/Zuma Press The U.K. antitrust body’s problem with Fox—that it is controlled by the Murdoch Family Trust, which also controls key U.K. newspapers (and The Wall Street Journal)—doesn’t apply to Disney. Fox said Disney was interested in Sky News even if its bid for Fox, which faces antitrust questions of its own, doesn’t work out.\nA final answer from the U.K. establishment is expected by mid-June, paving the way for a Sky shareholder vote on the Fox offer in July.\nComcast has also signaled its interest in Sky—at a higher price—but hasn’t made a concrete offer under U.K. takeover rules. It should formalize its bid in time to gain regulatory approval at the same time as Fox, giving Sky shareholders a choice of like-for-like bids. After that point Fox, backed by Disney, seems likely to increase its offer. \nSky shares rose Tuesday to £13.25, 6% ahead of Comcast’s informal offer, as investors interpreted Fox’s remedies as evidence of Disney’s tenacity.\nWhether Comcast then comes back with an even higher offer is a key uncertainty. Its shares have fallen 16% since it unveiled its interest in Sky; the benchmark is down 9%. Investors are fearful that the U.S. cable giant will overpay for a business offering few synergies. Ultimately, though, the controlling Roberts family may take a longer-term perspective than other shareholders.\nAnother wild card is the possibility that Comcast makes a play for all of Fox, rather than just Sky. This only seems likely if AT&T wins its antitrust case against the U.S. government to take control of Time Warner . A judgment may not emerge before June. Stay tuned.\nWrite to Stephen Wilmot at stephen.wilmot@wsj.com",
