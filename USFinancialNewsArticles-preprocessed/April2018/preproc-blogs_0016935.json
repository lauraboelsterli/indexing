    "text": "U.S. Orders Americans to Leave Blacklisted Russian Firms Policy comes alongside U.S. sanctions on oligarchs By 0 COMMENTS Aluminium ingots are seen stored at the foundry shop of the Rusal Krasnoyarsk aluminium smelter in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, on July 27, 2016. Photo: Reuters \nThe Trump administration’s latest round of sanctions on Russian oligarchs will echo through the U.S., as well as Moscow: Americans at blacklisted companies—or on their boards of directors—will have to leave their roles. \nThe sanctions announced on Friday were the latest salvo fired by the West against Russia as officials say tensions are rising to levels not seen since the end of the Cold War. Washington described the measures as a response to Moscow’s subversion of democracy , its hostile cyber activities and intervention in the Syrian war . \n“The Russian government operates for the disproportionate benefit of oligarchs and government elites,” said Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. “Russian oligarchs and elites who profit from this corrupt system will no longer be insulated from the consequences of their government’s destabilizing activities.” \nThe U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control issued guidance alongside the sanctions announcement in the form of an update to its frequently-asked-questions page. OFAC said any person working as an employee or sitting on the board of an entity placed on the sanctions list authorized under executive orders from 2014 targeting Russia can no longer keep that role. \n“You should review the actions you view as necessary to sever your ties with the blocked entity against applicable OFAC regulations, authorizations, and public guidance,” the document said. \nTreasury issued general licenses giving people a limited amount of time to cut their ties with the blacklisted firms. Anyone unsure whether actions needed to sever their relationships are prohibited should apply for a license or contact the office, the document said. \nTreasury recognizes how the sanctions are far-reaching, said Andrew Keller, a partner at the law firm Hogan Lovells LLP who previously served as a deputy assistant secretary in the U.S. State Department. The licenses and the guidance are OFAC’s attempt to grapple with the impact, he said. \n“It’s not a blank check for U.S. persons. They have to act now, or in very short order,” said Mr. Keller. \nThe U.S. action on Friday targeted seven Russian oligarchs, including Oleg Deripaska and Kirill Shamalov, as well as 17 Russian government officials, which included Alexander Torshin and Vladimir Kolokoltsev. They also hit companies tied to oligarchs or the Russian state. Those include a number of firms Treasury said were controlled by Mr. Deripaska, such as EN+ Group, which in turn controls United Co. Rusal PLC, one of the world’s largest aluminum producers. \nThe sanctions freeze the U.S. assets of those targeted, and they prohibit Americans from doing business with them. \nThe list of companies tied to the oligarchs shouldn’t be seen as exhaustive, Treasury said, reminding the corporate compliance community to do its due diligence regarding its so-called 50% rule. That rule automatically treats any entity more than half-owned by a blacklisted person as blocked property. \nSanctions attorneys have said for a long time that companies need to be careful about the ownership of their counterparties, especially in Russia, said Sanjay Mullick, a partner at the firm Kirkland & Ellis LLP. Friday’s action is a clear signal about the outlook for U.S. sanctions on Russia, he said. \n“Even if you don’t have present-day risk, you have to have eyes wide open for the risk coming down the pike,” he said. \nWrite to Samuel Rubenfeld at Samuel.Rubenfeld@wsj.com.
