(3) See notes (1) through (3) to the condensed consolidated statements of income and supplemental information for more information on as adjusted items and the reconciliation to GAAP.\nBlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK) today reported financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\n“Paced by a strong January, long-term net inflows of $55 billion, representing 5% annualized organic base fee growth, were positive across active and index strategies,\" commented Laurence D. Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock. \"Momentum continued in technology and risk management, with 19% year-over-year revenue growth, further highlighting the strength and diversity of our global platform.\n“Investors experienced a spike in market volatility during the quarter, driven by concerns over global trade policies, a heightened focus on rates and inflation, and headlines in the technology sector. Institutional investors, in particular, reacted to these factors, by de-risking and re-balancing. At the same time, we also saw many corporate clients adapting to U.S. tax reform by seeking liquidity to fund future capital investment or more aggressive share repurchases. As a result of these various crosscurrents, BlackRock experienced a significant number of both large inflows and large outflows from institutional clients in the first quarter. Total institutional net inflows were $3 billion, but reflected active net outflows from multi-asset strategies, primarily related to the loss of a single client from M&A activity, and from active fixed income strategies, linked to profit-taking and cash repatriation planning.\n“Driven by strong flows in our retail channels, BlackRock saw continued demand for a diverse range of fixed income strategies, including unconstrained, total return, short duration and emerging market debt, as well as alpha-seeking equity strategies. Our top performing fixed income platform saw $27 billion of net inflows across active and index. Active equities generated $1 billion of net inflows as performance improved, with 78% of fundamental equities and 90% of systematic active equity assets above benchmark or peer median for the five-year period.\n“iShares ® saw quarterly net inflows of $35 billion, as clients continued to use iShares at the core of their portfolios to drive active returns and as simple, efficient tools to manage risk exposure amid market volatility.\n“Growth in technology and risk management revenue was powered by demand for institutional Aladdin ® and expansion of our digital wealth and distribution technologies, including Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management and Cachematrix. We continue to invest in technology to enhance our distribution capabilities and help partners efficiently scale their businesses and construct better portfolios.\n“In a challenging environment, BlackRock continued to perform well. Building on a strong start to 2018, we remain committed to investing for growth and delivering the benefits of our scale to both clients and shareholders.”\nRESULTS BY CLIENT TYPE March 31, 2018 Q1 2018 Q1 2018 March 31, 2018 Q1 2018 AUM Base fees (1) (in millions), (unaudited) Net flows AUM Base fees (1) % of Total % of Total Retail $ 16,686 $ 638,363 $ 855 10 % 29 % iShares ETFs 34,649 1,767,925 1,158 28 % 39 % Institutional: Active (7,088 ) 1,130,446 527 18 % 18 % Index 10,378 2,324,327 256 37 % 9 % Total institutional 3,290 3,454,773 783 55 % 27 % Long-term 54,625 5,861,061 2,796 93 % 95 % Cash management 2,674 454,784 151 7 % 5 % Advisory (353 ) 1,139 - - - Total $ 56,946 $ 6,316,984 $ 2,947 100 % 100 % RESULTS BY INVESTMENT STYLE March 31, 2018 Q1 2018 Q1 2018 March 31, 2018 Q1 2018 AUM Base fees (1) (in millions), (unaudited) Net flows AUM Base fees (1) % of Total % of Total Active $ 5,513 $ 1,693,883 $ 1,365 27 % 46 % Index and iShares ETFs 49,112 4,167,178 1,431 66 % 49 % Long-term 54,625 5,861,061 2,796 93 % 95 % Cash management 2,674 454,784 151 7 % 5 % Advisory (353 ) 1,139 - - - Total $ 56,946 �� $ 6,316,984 $ 2,947 100 % 100 % RESULTS BY PRODUCT TYPE March 31, 2018 Q1 2018 Q1 2018 March 31, 2018 Q1 2018 AUM Base fees (1) (in millions), (unaudited) Net flows AUM Base fees (1) % of Total % of Total Equity $ 26,514 $ 3,363,237 $ 1,540 53 % 52 % Fixed income 26,683 1,886,523 757 30 % 26 % Multi-asset (1,987 ) 476,697 296 8 % 10 % Alternatives 3,415 134,604 203 2 % 7 % Long-term 54,625 5,861,061 2,796 93 % 95 % Cash management 2,674 454,784 151 7 % 5 % Advisory (353 ) 1,139 - - - Total $ 56,946 $ 6,316,984 $ 2,947 100 % 100 % (1) Base fees include investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS\nLong-term net inflows of $57.3 billion and $3.2 billion from clients in the Americas and Asia-Pacific regions, respectively, were partially offset by net outflows of $5.9 billion from clients in EMEA. At March 31, 2018, BlackRock managed 63% of its long-term AUM for clients in the Americas, 29% for clients in EMEA and 8% for clients in Asia-Pacific.\nThe Company’s net flows by client type for the first quarter of 2018 are presented below.\nRetail long-term net inflows of $16.7 billion reflected net inflows of $8.7 billion in the United States and $8.0 billion internationally. Fixed income net inflows of $10.0 billion were diversified across the Company’s top-performing active platform, led by net inflows into unconstrained, emerging market and municipals categories. Equity net inflows of $4.2 billion reflected inflows into index mutual funds and international active equities. Multi-asset net inflows of $2.0 billion were largely due to inflows into the Multi-asset Income fund family. iShares ETFs long-term net inflows of $34.6 billion reflected strength in iShares Core ETFs. Equity net inflows of $29.7 billion were driven by both U.S. and international equity market exposures. Fixed income and commodity iShares generated $3.2 billion and $1.7 billion of net inflows, respectively. Institutional active long-term net outflows of $7.1 billion were driven by fixed income outflows of $4.1 billion linked to profit-taking and cash repatriation planning, and multi-asset net outflows of $4.1 billion resulting from a single redemption associated with client M&A activity. Alternatives net inflows of $1.4 billion were led by inflows into hedge funds, private equity solutions and infrastructure offerings. Institutional index long-term net inflows of $10.4 billion included fixed income net inflows of $17.5 billion, led by demand for liability-driven solutions, partially offset by equity net outflows of $7.2 billion.\nCash management AUM increased 1% from the prior quarter to $454.8 billion.\nINVESTMENT PERFORMANCE AT MARCH 31, 2018 (1)\nOne-year period Three-year period Five-year period Fixed income: Actively managed AUM above benchmark or peer median Taxable 83% 72% 90% Tax-exempt 63% 58% 74% Index AUM within or above applicable tolerance 96% 99% 100% Equity: Actively managed AUM above benchmark or peer median Fundamental 66% 77% 78% Systematic 84% 89% 90% Index AUM within or above applicable tolerance 96% 98% 98% (1) Past performance is not indicative of future results.

Highlights\nInvestment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue increased $424 million from the first quarter of 2017, reflecting the impact of higher markets and organic growth on average AUM and the impact of foreign exchange movements, partially offset by previously announced pricing changes to select investment products. Securities lending revenue of $155 million in the current quarter compared with $141 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nInvestment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue increased $50 million from the fourth quarter of 2017, driven by higher average AUM and foreign exchange movements, partially offset by the effect of two less days in the current quarter. Securities lending revenue of $155 million in the current quarter compared with $150 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Performance fees decreased $215 million from the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to seasonally higher fees from funds with a performance measurement period that ended in the fourth quarter of 2017. Technology and risk management revenue increased $30 million from the first quarter of 2017 and $8 million from the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting ongoing demand for institutional Aladdin and expansion of digital wealth and distribution technologies, including Aladdin Risk for Wealth Management and Cachematrix.

Direct fund expense increased $55 million from the first quarter of 2017 and $24 million from the fourth quarter of 2017, reflecting higher average AUM.\nINCOME TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT)\nThree Three Months Ended Months Ended March 31, December 31, (in millions), (unaudited) 2018 2017 (a) Change 2017 (a) Change Income tax expense (benefit) $ 265 $ 268 $ (3 ) $ (815 ) $ 1,080 Effective tax rate 19.6 % 23.8 % (420 ) bps (55.1 )% 7,470 bps (a) Financial results for 2017 were recast to reflect the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard.

Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nManagement uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.\nComputations for all periods are derived from the condensed consolidated statements of income as follows:\n(1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors.\nOperating income, as adjusted, includes non-GAAP expense adjustments. The portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded, or to be funded, through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) has been excluded because it ultimately does not impact BlackRock’s book value. Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods.\nRevenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to third parties. Management believes such costs represent a benchmark for the amount of revenue passed through to external parties who distribute the Company’s products. BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to distribution and servicing costs as a proxy for such offsetting revenue.\n(2) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted: Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.\nSee aforementioned discussion regarding operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, for information on the PNC LTIP funding obligation.\nFor each period presented, the non-GAAP adjustment related to the PNC LTIP funding obligation was tax effected at the respective blended rates applicable to the adjustments. The fourth quarter of 2017 noncash deferred tax revaluation benefit of $1,758 million and the other income tax matters were primarily associated with the revaluation of certain deferred tax liabilities related to intangible assets and goodwill. Amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. A deemed repatriation tax expense of $477 million has been excluded from the fourth quarter of 2017 as adjusted results due to the one-time nature and to ensure comparability among periods presented.\nPer share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.\n(3) Nonvoting participating preferred stock is considered to be a common stock equivalent for purposes of determining basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis earnings release, and other statements that BlackRock may make, may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, with respect to BlackRock’s future financial or business performance, strategies or expectations.
