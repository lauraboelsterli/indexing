    "text": "SPOKANE, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Clearwater Paper Corporation (NYSE:CLW) today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\nThe company reported net sales of $437.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, essentially flat with net sales of $437.5 million for the first quarter of 2017. Net earnings determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, for the first quarter of 2018 were $2.6 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to net earnings for the first quarter of 2017 of $7.5 million, or $0.45 per diluted share. The decrease in net earnings was due primarily to challenging industry-wide economic conditions, which include lower non-ultra grade tissue pricing and higher input costs for transportation, wood fiber, external pulp and chemicals. In addition, shipment volumes were lower and the company incurred reorganization related expenses associated with its selling, general and administrative cost reduction efforts. Those items were partially offset by higher paperboard pricing, operating productivity improvements, improved product mix for both businesses, and a lower tax rate. Excluding certain non-core items identified in the attached Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, first quarter 2018 adjusted net earnings were $5.2 million, or $0.31 per diluted share, compared to first quarter 2017 adjusted net earnings of $10.7 million, or $0.64 per diluted share.\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, were $35.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $48.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $39.8 million, down 19.3% compared to first quarter 2017 Adjusted EBITDA of $49.3 million.\n“The first quarter showed solid demand for our consumer tissue and paperboard products. This demand was offset by continued competitive pressures especially in conventional grades of retail tissue and higher input costs for both businesses,” said Linda K. Massman, president and chief executive officer. “We will continue to enhance our leading position in at-home private label tissue and SBS paperboard while continuing to aggressively improve our cost position and efficiencies to generate strong cash flow and improved Return On Invested Capital.”\nFIRST QUARTER 2018 SEGMENT PERFORMANCE\nConsumer Products\nNet sales in the Consumer Products segment were $238.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, down 1.5% compared to first quarter 2017 net sales of $242.4 million. This decrease was due primarily to lower shipment volumes of parent rolls and away-from-home tissue, partially offset by a 2.9% increase in retail tissue volumes.\nOperating income and margin for the first quarter of 2018 decreased to $1.6 million and 0.7%, compared to $6.2 million and 2.6%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2017. After adjusting for certain non-core items identified in the attached Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, adjusted operating income and margin of $3.1 million and 1.3% for the first quarter of 2018 were down from $12.4 million and 5.1% for the same period in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment decreased from $27.0 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $17.4 million in the first quarter of 2018. These decreases were primarily due to higher input costs for transportation and external pulp.\nTissue Sales Volumes and Prices:\nTotal tissue volumes sold were 92,207 tons in the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 3.3% compared to 95,364 tons in the first quarter of 2017. Converted product cases shipped were 13.3 million in the first quarter of 2018, 1.1% higher than 13.1 million cases shipped in the first quarter of 2017. Average tissue net selling prices increased 1.1% or $29 per ton to $2,568 per ton in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $2,539 per ton in the first quarter of 2017, due to improved product mix.\nPulp and Paperboard\nNet sales in the Pulp and Paperboard segment were $198.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, up 1.5% compared to first quarter 2017 net sales of $195.1 million. The increase was primarily due to higher paperboard prices.\nOperating income for the first quarter of 2018 decreased $1.0 million to $26.2 million, compared to operating income of $27.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. Pulp and paperboard's operating margin decreased to 13.2% in the first quarter of 2018 from 13.9% in the first quarter of 2017. These decreases were primarily due to higher input costs for chemicals and wood fiber, as well as higher planned maintenance at the Arkansas mill and increased depreciation expense, partially offset by increased net sales. After adjusting for the increased depreciation expense and certain non-core items identified in the attached Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, Adjusted EBITDA for the segment was $35.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $35.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nPaperboard Sales Volumes and Prices:\nPaperboard sales volumes were 206,309 tons in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 210,382 tons in the first quarter of 2017. Paperboard net selling prices increased 3.6% to $960 per ton for the first quarter 2018, compared to $927 per ton in the first quarter of 2017.\nTaxes\nThe company's consolidated tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was a benefit of 16.1%. This compares to a 40.0% tax rate in the first quarter of 2017. The favorable tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was primarily the result of the federal corporate rate reduction enacted with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In addition, during the first quarter of 2018 the company recognized income tax benefits from a federal tax law extension on a previously expired credit and the remeasurement of deferred tax items reflecting enacted state tax rate changes.\nNote Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn this press release, the company presents certain non-GAAP financial information for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017, including adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per diluted share, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin. Because these amounts are not in accordance with GAAP, reconciliations to net earnings, net earnings per diluted share and operating income as determined in accordance with GAAP are included in the tables at the end of this press release. The company presents these non-GAAP amounts because management believes they assist investors and analysts in comparing the company's performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. In addition, the company uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA: (i) as factors in evaluating management’s performance when determining incentive compensation, (ii) to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and (iii) because our credit agreement and the indentures governing our outstanding notes use metrics similar to EBITDA to measure our compliance with certain covenants.\nWEBCAST INFORMATION\nClearwater Paper Corporation will discuss these results during an earnings conference call that begins at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time today. A live webcast and accompanying supplemental information will be available on the company's website at http://ir.clearwaterpaper.com . A replay of today's conference call will be available on the website at http://ir.clearwaterpaper.com/results.cfm beginning at 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time today.\nABOUT CLEARWATER PAPER\nClearwater Paper manufactures quality consumer tissue, away-from-home tissue, parent roll tissue, bleached paperboard and pulp at manufacturing facilities across the nation.
