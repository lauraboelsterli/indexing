    "text": "PARIS, April 27 (Reuters) - Airbus posted a slender first-quarter profit after delays in engine deliveries for its A320neo passenger jet, and it also cut production of the larger A330 due to weak demand.\nEuropeâ€™s largest aerospace group reported an adjusted quarterly operating profit of 14 million euros ($17 million), compared with a restated year-earlier loss of 19 million. Revenues fell 12 percent to 10.119 billion euros. Airbus reaffirmed forecasts.\nAnalysts were on average expecting a 23.9 million euro operating loss on revenues of 10.209 billion, according to a Reuters poll.\nAirbus said it had decided to reduce A330 deliveries to around 50 per year in 2019 amid weak demand, without giving a comparison figure.\n$1 = 0.8258 euros Reporting by Tim Hepher, Cyril Altmeyer; Editing by Sudip Kar-Gupta\n ",
