Photo: Associated Press \nThe Trump administration accused a Syrian organization of attempting to smuggle migrants to the U.S. border, imposing sanctions on the group and its leader.\nThe Homs-based organization, led by Syrian Nasif Barakat, facilitated the movement since 2013 of hundreds of people from Syria and Lebanon to the U.S. border, operating through a global network of smugglers, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The smuggling network uses a route that begins in Syria, travels through Lebanon, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, and then to Brazil, through South and Central American countries before reaching the Southwest border in Mexico, the U.S. alleged.\nMr. Barakat’s organization charged migrants an average of $20,000 per person, which included fees to obtain fraudulent documents, such as fake passports from many countries, to facilitate their movement, Treasury said.\nIt isn’t clear whether any migrants utilizing the network crossed into the U.S. A Treasury Department spokesman declined to comment, and representatives of U.S. Customs and Border Protection didn’t immediately reply to requests for comment.\nAs a result of the sanctions, all of Mr. Barakat’s U.S. assets, and those of his organization, are frozen. Americans are barred from transactions involving Mr. Barakat or his group.\nWednesday’s action, taken by Treasury under an executive order targeting transnational organized crime, follows airstrikes on Syria over the weekend in response to a suspected chemical-weapons attack that killed 43 civilians and injured hundreds. The Syrian government has repeatedly been accused of using chemical weapons on civilians during the seven-year civil war. Syria and its chief patron, Russia, have denied that chemical weapons were used in the attack.\nThe Trump administration has struggled in recent days to decide whether to impose sanctions on Russia over its support for the Syrian regime. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations had said Washington was set to act, but White House officials backed off, saying the earlier comments were premature.\nRefugee settlement in the U.S. of Syrians fleeing the conflict has slowed to a trickle: Only 11 were accepted so far this year, according to an NPR report citing State Department figures.\nThe sanctions on Wednesday also come as the administration heightens its efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the U.S. illegally. Immigration advocates have decried the crackdown.\n“The day I was sworn in as attorney general, President Trump sent me an executive order to dismantle transnational criminal organizations. Many of these organizations use human smugglers to bring people across our borders with little regard to their safety or our national sovereignty,” said Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\nWrite to Samuel Rubenfeld at Samuel.Rubenfeld@wsj.com Follow him on Twitter at @srubenfeld .\nShare this: Previous The Morning Risk Report: Commerce Dept.
