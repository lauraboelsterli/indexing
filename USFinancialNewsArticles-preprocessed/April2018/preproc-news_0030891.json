    "text": "April 16, 2018 / 7:51 PM / Updated 9 minutes ago MOVES-Morgan Stanley loses co-head of consumer and retail investment banking -sources Harry Brumpton , Greg Roumeliotis 1 Min Read \nApril 16 (Reuters) - Benjamin Frost, global co-head of consumer retail investment banking at Morgan Stanley, has departed the bank and is in talks to join Goldman Sachs Group Inc, people familiar with the matter on Monday. \nFrost has not yet agreed terms with Goldman Sachs, the sources cautioned, asking not to be identified because the matter is not public. \nGoldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. \nUntil leaving Morgan Stanley, New York-based Frost had been with the bank for more than 15 years, according to his LinkedIn page. He had been a managing director since December 2009. \nFrost was among the bankers at Morgan Stanley advising Unilever Plc after the Anglo-Dutch household goods company became a takeover target of consumer products peer Kraft Heinz Inc early last year. \nHe also advised Mars Inc in its $9.1-billion acquisition of animal-hospital chain VCA Inc last year.
