    "text": "0 COMMENTS A Levi's store Photo: Bloomberg \nLevi Strauss & Co. is introducing robotic software to its finance function as the company’s efforts to automate the production of its iconic jeans have extended to the back office, said Chief Financial Officer Harmit Singh.\n“We are introducing bots where it makes sense,” he said. “The idea is not to eliminate jobs. We are going to upskill employees and have them spend more time on analysis.”\nThe move mirrors Levi’s recent push to use lasers to create the holes , fraying and fading to give jeans a worn look, and replace a labor-intensive hand-finishing process.\nThe San Francisco-based company posted revenue of $4.9 billion in its 2017 fiscal year ended in November up 7.7% from the prior year, according to regulatory filings. Income reached $281.4 million in 2017, down from $291 million a year ago.\nLevi’s is also exploring the greater flexibility to repatriate foreign profits under the new U.S. tax law, Mr. Singh said. The company typically brings home between $100 million and $150 million annually, he said. Levi’s has about $600 million in cash with roughly 80% of it overseas, he added.\n“There’s no real impact on cash flow. What the law has provided is more flexibility in bringing cash home from international jurisdictions,” he said.\nHe didn’t provide an exact figure on how much the company plans to bring home. He said the great flexibility hasn’t changed the company’s strategic aims, which include investing in the international segment, which has grown larger than the domestic business, he said. “That was not the case five years ago,” he said.\nThe privately-owned company has booked a one-time charge of $136 million dollars in its latest quarter linked to the tax legislation. The overhaul lowered the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% previously and introduced a mandatory one-time tax of 15.5% on unrepatriated foreign cash.\nShare this: ACCOUNTING AUTOMATION tax Previous The Morning Ledger: Volkswagen's CEO Set to Be Replaced Next The Morning Ledger: U.S. Trade Groups Lobby Against China Tariffs  ",
