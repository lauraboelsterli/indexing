    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Vocera Communications, Inc. (NYSE:VCRA), a recognized leader in clinical communication and workflow solutions, today announced the company’s board of directors elected President and CEO Brent D. Lang to chairman of the board, effective June 1, 2018, following the annual shareholder meeting. Lang succeeds Robert J. Zollars, who will be transitioning off the board at the same time, having reached the end of his term. Lang has been a member of the Vocera board since his appointment to CEO in 2013 when he succeeded Zollars in that position as well. Howard Janzen will continue to serve as the board’s lead independent director.\n“It’s time to complete the passing of the baton to Brent, who is doing a stellar job leading Vocera and driving the company’s growth and innovations to improve the healthcare experience,\" Zollars said. “The Vocera board fully supported this transition and is fortunate to have someone with Brent's experience, vision and successful track record.”\nZollars has served as chairman of the board since June 2007, and served as CEO of Vocera for six years. For more than 30 years, Zollars has made a significant impact on many people, products and businesses, leading 11 businesses as president or chief executive officer (CEO), in a range of different markets, including distribution, medical products, pharmaceutical services, and healthcare communication. In 2012, he worked closely with Lang to successfully lead Vocera through its journey to become a publicly traded company.\n\"Bob has made a lasting impression on Vocera both as the CEO and as board chairman,” said Lang. “He has worked tirelessly to help build a solid foundation for the company’s growth and continued innovation. He has been a great mentor to me and our employees. We are grateful for his many years of service and support.\"\nAbout Vocera\nThe mission of Vocera Communications, Inc. is to simplify and improve the lives of healthcare professionals and patients, while enabling hospitals to enhance quality of care and operational efficiency.
