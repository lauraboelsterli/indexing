    "text": "Japan's Nintendo Co Ltd said on Thursday it expects operating profit to rise 26.7 percent in the year through March to a nine-year high, as its Switch games console maintains sales momentum in its second year.\nNintendo estimated profit to reach 225 billion yen ($2.06 billion) from 177.56 billion yen a year prior. If achieved, it would be Nintendo's highest operating profit since the year ended March 2010.\nThe outlook compared with the 308.72 billion yen average of 21 analyst estimates in a survey by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nKyoto-based Nintendo is aiming to sell 20 million Switch consoles in the financial year started April, confirming its previous forecast made in January.\nSales of the hybrid home-portable console reached 15 million units in the year ended March, bringing the cumulative total to 17.8 units since its global release in March last year.",
