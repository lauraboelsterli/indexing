    "text": "April 16, 2018 / 3:58 AM / Updated 2 hours ago Moyes happy to give Arnautovic 'leg room' Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - West Ham United are willing to give playmaker Marko Arnautovic the space he needs to flourish as long as the Austrian delivers for the team, manager David Moyes has said ahead of Monday’s Premier League clash against Stoke City. Soccer Football - Premier League - West Ham United vs Southampton - London Stadium, London, Britain - March 31, 2018 West Ham United's Marko Arnautovic applauds fans after the match Action Images via Reuters/Tony O'Brien \nArnautovic, 28, had a poor start to his West Ham career and failed to score in his first 11 league appearances but has found a rich vein of form and scored nine in his last 14 outings. \n\"Players like Marko need a little bit of leg room, maybe more than others, and I think we gave Marko his leg room but I want to make sure he knows he has got to do the job here,\" Moyes told West Ham's website www.whufc.com . \n“I don’t think he will (slack off) now, because he knows what got the crowd from booing him to cheering him every week and becoming one of their heroes.” \nWest Ham, who have yet to win consecutive home league games this season, can climb to 12th in the table, nine points clear of the relegation zone, if they beat Stoke.
