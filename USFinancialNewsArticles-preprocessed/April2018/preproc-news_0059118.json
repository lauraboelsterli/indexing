    "text": "MICHIGAN CITY, Ind., April 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Horizon Bancorp (“Horizon” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:HBNC) today announced its unaudited financial results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018.\nSUMMARY:\nNet income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $12.8 million, or $0.50 diluted earnings per share, compared to $8.2 million, or $0.37 diluted earnings per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. This represents the highest quarterly net income and diluted earnings per share in the Company’s 145-year history.\nReturn on average assets was 1.32% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 1.07% for the first quarter of 2017.\nReturn on average equity was 11.29% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 9.66% for the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal loans increased by an annualized rate of 3.4%, or $23.7 million, during the first quarter of 2018.\nConsumer loans increased by an annualized rate of 17.6%, or $20.0 million, during the first quarter of 2018.\nResidential mortgage loans increased by an annualized rate of 7.6%, or $11.4 million, during the first quarter of 2018.\nNet interest income increased $7.8 million, or 30.7%, to $33.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $25.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nNet interest margin was 3.81% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 3.80% for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nHorizon’s tangible book value per share increased to $12.86 compared to $12.72 and $11.79 at December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively. This represents the highest tangible book value per share in the Company’s 145-year history.\nCraig Dwight, Chairman and CEO, commented: “We are pleased to announce record 2018 first quarter earnings of $0.50 diluted earnings per share. Horizon’s net income of $12.8 million was an increase of $4.6 million, or 55.7%, when compared to the prior year. Diluted earnings per share increased $0.13 per share, or 35.1%, to $0.50, for the first quarter of 2018 when compared to the prior year.”\nDwight continued, “Horizon’s total loans increased at an annualized rate of 3.4% for the first quarter led by consumer and mortgage loan annualized growth of 17.6% and 7.6%, respectively. Our organic loan growth was somewhat tempered during the first quarter of 2018 due to approximately $64.7 million of commercial loan payoffs, the majority of which were expected or requested by Horizon Bank. The Bank originated approximately $116.0 million in commercial loans during the first quarter of 2018; however, only $41.2 million of these loan originations had been funded as of March 31, 2018. Horizon’s growth markets of Fort Wayne, Grand Rapids, Indianapolis and Kalamazoo, grew loans by $14.8 million, for an annualized rate of 11.8%, during the first quarter of 2018.”\nMr. Dwight concluded, “As expected, Horizon started to fully realize the cost savings from our 2017 acquisitions of Lafayette Community Bancorp and Wolverine Bancorp, Inc. during the first quarter of 2018. Increases in net interest income and non-interest income of $7.6 million and $759,000, respectively, more than offset an increase in non-interest expense of $4.3 million when compared to the prior year helping to improve our efficiency ratio to 61.92% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 64.97% for the same period in the prior year. Given that the first quarter is typically Horizon’s seasonally slow period, we expect continued growth and further improvement in our efficiency during the year.”\nIncome Statement Highlights\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $12.8 million, or $0.50 diluted earnings per share, compared to $7.6 million, or $0.30 diluted earnings per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $8.2 million, or $0.37 diluted earnings per share, for the first quarter of 2017. Excluding acquisition-related expenses, gain on sale of investment securities, gain on the accounting for Horizon’s equity interest in Lafayette Community Bancorp, tax reform bill impact and purchase accounting adjustments (“core net income”), net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $11.2 million, or $0.44 diluted earnings per share, compared to $10.1 million, or $0.40 diluted earnings per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $7.5 million, or $0.34 diluted earnings per share, for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe increase in net income and diluted earnings per share from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018 reflects an increase in net interest income of $2.0 million and decreases in income tax expense of $3.2 million, provision for loan losses of $533,000 and non-interest expense of $454,000, partially offset by a decrease in non-interest income of $1.0 million.\nThe decrease in non-interest income from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018 was due to lower fiduciary fees as ESOP fees were lower during the first quarter of 2018, lower gain on sale of mortgage loans and lower other income as the previous quarter included $530,000 gain on the accounting for Horizon’s equity interest in Lafayette Community Bancorp prior to the 2017 merger.\nThe increase in net income and diluted earnings per share from the first quarter of 2017 to the same 2018 period reflects an increase in net interest income of $7.8 million, an increase in non-interest income of $759,000 and a decrease in income tax expense of $531,000, partially offset by increases in non-interest expense of $4.3 million and provision for loan losses of $237,000. The increase in diluted earnings per share was due to an increase in net income of $4.6 million when compared to the prior year, offset by an increase in average diluted shares outstanding as a result of issuing shares as part of the consideration for the acquisitions of Lafayette Community Bancorp and Wolverine Bancorp, Inc.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation of Net Income and Diluted Earnings per Share (Dollars in Thousands, Except per Share Data, Unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31 December 31 March 31 2018 2017 2017 Non-GAAP Reconciliation of Net Income Net income as reported $ 12,804 $ 7,650 $ 8,224 Merger expenses - 1,444 - Tax effect - (418 ) - Net income excluding merger expenses 12,804 8,676 8,224 Gain on sale of investment securities (11 ) - (35 ) Tax effect 2 - 12 Net income excluding gain on sale of investment securities 12,795 8,676 8,201 Gain on remeasurement of equity interest in Lafayette - (530 ) - Tax effect - 78 - Net income excluding gain on remeasurement of\nequity interest in Lafayette 12,795 8,224 8,201 Tax reform bill impact - 2,426 - Net income excluding tax reform bill impact 12,795 10,650 8,201 Acquisition-related purchase accounting adjustments (\"PAUs\") (2,037 ) (868 ) (1,016 ) Tax effect 428 304 356 Core Net Income $ 11,186 $ 10,086 $ 7,541 Non-GAAP Reconciliation of Diluted Earnings per Share Diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") as reported $ 0.50 $ 0.30 $ 0.37 Merger expenses - 0.06 - Tax effect - (0.02 ) - Diluted EPS excluding merger expenses 0.50 0.34 0.37 Gain on sale of investment securities - - - Tax effect - - - Diluted EPS excluding gain on sale of investment securities 0.50 0.34 0.37 Gain on remeasurement of equity interest in Lafayette - (0.02 ) - Tax effect - - - Diluted EPS excluding gain on remeasurement of\nequity interest in Lafayette 0.50 0.32 0.37 Tax reform bill impact - 0.10 - Diluted EPS excluding tax reform bill impact 0.50 0.42 0.37 Acquisition-related PAUs (0.08 ) (0.03 ) (0.05 ) Tax effect 0.02 0.01 0.02 Core Diluted EPS $ 0.44 $ 0.40 $ 0.34\nHorizon’s net interest margin increased to 3.81% for the first quarter of 2018 when compared to 3.71% for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 3.80% for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in net interest margin from the fourth quarter of 2017 reflects an increase in the yield of interest-earning assets of 18 basis points, offset by an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities of nine basis points. The increase in the yield of interest-earning assets was due to an increase in the yield on loans receivable and non-taxable investment securities of 22 and 18 basis points, respectively. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was due to an increase in the cost of interest-bearing deposits and borrowings of six and nine basis points, respectively.\nThe increase in net interest margin from the first quarter of 2017 reflects an increase in the yield of interest-earning assets of 22 basis points, offset by an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities of 26 basis points. The increase in yield of interest-earning assets was due to an increase in the yield on loans receivable of 25 basis points. The increase in cost of interest-bearing liabilities was due to increases in the cost of interest-bearing deposits and borrowings of 15 and 46 basis points, respectively.\nExcluding acquisition-related purchase accounting adjustments (“core net interest margin”), the margin was 3.55% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 3.61% for the prior quarter and 3.66% for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in core net interest margin was due to an increased cost of funding when comparing the periods. Interest income from acquisition-related purchase accounting adjustments was $2.0 million, $868,000 and $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation of Net Interest Margin (Dollars in Thousands, Unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31 December 31 March 31 2018 2017 2017 Non-GAAP Reconciliation of Net Interest Margin Net interest income as reported $ 33,411 $ 31,455 $ 25,568 Average interest-earning assets 3,580,143 3,471,169 2,797,429 Net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets\n(\"Net Interest Margin\") 3.81 % 3.71 % 3.80 % Acquisition-related purchase accounting adjustments (\"PAUs\") (2,037 ) (868 ) (1,016 ) Core net interest income 31,374 30,587 24,552 Core net interest margin 3.55 % 3.61 % 3.66 %\nLending Activity\nTotal loans increased $23.7 million from $2.835 billion as of December 31, 2017 to $2.859 billion as of March 31, 2018 as consumer loans increased by $20.0 million, residential mortgage loans increased by $11.4 million and mortgage warehouse loans increased by $6.8 million. These increases were offset by a decrease in commercial loans of $13.4 million from December 31, 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, $64.7 million in commercial loan payoffs occurred, the majority of which were either expected or requested by the Bank. The Bank originated approximately $116.0 million in commercial loans during the first quarter of 2018; however, only $41.2 million of these loans funded as of March 31, 2018.\nLoan Growth by Type, Excluding Acquired Loans (Dollars in Thousands, Unaudited) March 31 December 31 Amount Percent 2018 2017 Change Change Commercial $ 1,656,374 $ 1,669,728 $ (13,354 ) -0.8 % Residential mortgage 618,131 606,760 11,371 1.9 % Consumer 480,989 460,999 19,990 4.3 % Subtotal 2,755,494 2,737,487 18,007 0.7 % Held for sale loans 1,973 3,094 (1,121 ) -36.2 % Mortgage warehouse loans 101,299 94,508 6,791 7.2 % Total loans $ 2,858,766 $ 2,835,089 $ 23,677 0.8 %\nResidential mortgage lending activity for the three months ended March 31, 2018 generated $1.4 million in income from the gain on sale of mortgage loans, a decrease of $565,000 from the fourth quarter of 2017 and a decrease of $491,000 from the first quarter of 2017. Total origination volume for the first quarter of 2018, including loans placed into portfolio, totaled $72.3 million, representing a decrease of 19.8% from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of 9.7% from the first quarter of 2017. Revenue derived from Horizon’s residential mortgage lending activities was only 5.4% of Horizon’s total revenue for the first quarter of 2018.\nPurchase money mortgage originations during the first quarter of 2018 represented 76.6% of total originations compared to 73.7% of total originations during the fourth quarter of 2017 and 69.8% during the first quarter of 2017.\nThe provision for loan losses totaled $567,000 for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $1.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $330,000 for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in the provision for loan losses from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018 was due to the reduction in total commercial loans and good credit quality. The increase in the provision for loan losses from the first quarter of 2017 to the first quarter of 2018 was due to additional general and non-specific allocations for loan growth in new markets and an increase in allocation for other economic factors during 2018.\nThe ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans remained at 0.58% as of March 31, 2018 when compared to December 31, 2017 and decreased from 0.70% as of March 31, 2017 due to an increase in gross loans. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans, excluding loans with credit-related purchase accounting adjustments, was 0.77% as of March 31, 2018 compared to 0.81% as of December 31, 2017. Loan loss reserves and credit-related loan discounts on acquired loans as a percentage of total loans was 1.15% as of March 31, 2018 compared to 1.23% as of December 31, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Allowance for Loan and Lease Loss Detail As of March 31, 2018 (Dollars in Thousands, Unaudited) Pre-discount\nLoan\nBalance Allowance\nfor Loan\nLosses\n(ALLL) Loan\nDiscount ALLL\n+\nLoan\nDiscount Loans, net ALLL/\nPre-discount\nLoan Balance Loan\nDiscount/\nPre-discount\nLoan Balance ALLL + Loan\nDiscount/\nPre-discount\nLoan Balance Horizon Legacy $ 2,152,002 $ 16,474 N/A $ 16,474 $ 2,135,528 0.77 % 0.00 % 0.77 % Heartland 10,848 - 742 742 10,106 0.00 % 6.84 % 6.84 % Summit 35,397 - 2,147 2,147 33,250 0.00 % 6.07 % 6.07 % Peoples 105,363 - 2,609 2,609 102,754 0.00 % 2.48 % 2.48 % Kosciusko 52,298 - 664 664 51,634 0.00 % 1.27 % 1.27 % LaPorte 121,265 - 3,445 3,445 117,820 0.00 % 2.84 % 2.84 % CNB 5,561 - 152 152 5,409 0.00 % 2.73 % 2.73 % Lafayette 118,829 - 2,170 2,170 116,659 0.00 % 1.83 % 1.83 % Wolverine 257,203 - 4,346 4,346 252,857 0.00 % 1.69 % 1.69 % Total $ 2,858,766 $ 16,474 $ 16,275 $ 32,749 $ 2,826,017 0.58 % 0.57 % 1.15 %\nAs of March 31, 2018, non-performing loans totaled $15.1 million, which reflects a five basis point decrease in non-performing loans to total loans, or a $1.3 million decline from $16.4 million in non-performing loans as of December 31, 2017. Compared to December 31, 2017, non-performing commercial loans decreased by $576,000, non-performing real estate loans decreased by $440,000 and non-performing consumer loans decreased by $317,000.\nExpense Management\nTotal non-interest expense was $454,000 lower in the first quarter of 2018 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017; however, excluding merger-related expenses of $1.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, total non-interest expense increased $990,000, or 4.0%. The increase in non-interest expense, after excluding merger-related expenses, was due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, net occupancy, data processing and other expense.\nSalaries and employee benefits expense was $284,000 higher during the first quarter of 2018 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, when adjusted for merger-related expenses, due to higher employment and unemployment taxes, health insurance, 401K and supplemental employee retirement plan match expenses. Employment and unemployment taxes and health insurance expense is typically higher during the first quarter of the year due to the nature of these expenses. Expenses related to the Company’s match on 401K and supplemental employee retirement plans were higher during the first quarter as a result of the 2017 bonuses paid in March 2018. Net occupancy expense, adjusted for merger-related expenses, was $499,000 higher during the first quarter of 2018 when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 due to an increase in snow removal costs and market expansions. Data processing and other expense increased $124,000 and $177,000, respectively, when adjusted for merger-related expenses, due to market expansions and recent acquisitions. These increases were offset by a decrease in loan expense of $141,000 due to a decrease in collection-related expenses when comparing the first quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2017.\nTotal non-interest expense was $4.3 million higher in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period of 2017. The increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $2.7 million, other expenses of $526,000, net occupancy expenses of $514,000, data processing expenses of $389,000 and loan expense of $150,000. The increase in salaries and employee benefits reflects overall company growth and recent acquisitions. Other expense and data processing increased as a result of market expansions and acquisitions. Net occupancy expense increased due to increased snow removal costs incurred in 2018, along with market expansions and acquisitions. Loan expense increased due to a higher level of loan originations in the first quarter of 2018 when compared to the same period of 2017.\nIncome tax expense totaled $2.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of $3.2 million and $531,000 when compared to the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2017, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of the new corporate tax rate which was signed into law at the end of 2017. An adjustment to Horizon’s net deferred tax asset of $2.4 million ($1.7 million of net deferred tax assets and $766,000 of net deferred tax assets related to accumulated other comprehensive income) was recorded to income tax expense during the fourth quarter of 2017 to reflect the new corporate tax rate.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nCertain information set forth in this press release refers to financial measures determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, we have included non-GAAP financial measures relating to net income, diluted earnings per share, net interest margin, total loans and loan growth, the allowance for loan and lease losses, tangible stockholders’ equity, tangible book value per share, the return on average assets and the return on average equity. In each case, we have identified special circumstances that we consider to be non-recurring and have excluded them, to show the impact of such events as acquisition-related purchase accounting adjustments, prepayment penalties on borrowings and the tax reform bill, among others we have identified in our reconciliations. Horizon believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are helpful to investors and provide a greater understanding of our business without giving effect to the purchase accounting impacts and one-time costs of acquisitions and non-core items. These measures are not necessarily comparable to similar measures that may be presented by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measure. See the tables and other information below and contained elsewhere in this press release for reconciliations of the non-GAAP figures identified herein and their most comparable GAAP measures.\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation of Tangible Stockholders' Equity and Tangible Book Value per Share (Dollars in Thousands Except per Share Data, Unaudited) March 31 December 31 September 30 June 30 March 31 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 Total stockholders' equity $ 460,416 $ 457,078 $ 392,055 $ 357,259 $ 348,575 Less: Intangible assets 131,724 132,282 103,244 86,726 87,094 Total tangible stockholders' equity $ 328,692 $ 324,796 $ 288,811 $ 270,533 $ 261,481 Common shares outstanding 25,555,235 25,529,819 23,325,459 22,176,465 22,176,465 Tangible book value per common share $ 12.86 $ 12.72 $ 12.38 $ 12.20 $ 11.79\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation of Return on Average Assets and Return on Average Common Equity (Dollars in Thousands, Unaudited) Three Months Ended March 31 December 31 March 31 2018 2017 2017 Non-GAAP Reconciliation of Return on Average Assets Average Assets $ 3,942,837 $ 3,841,551 $ 3,103,468 Return on average assets (\"ROAA\") as reported 1.32 % 0.79 % 1.07 % Merger expenses 0.00 % 0.15 % 0.00 % Tax effect 0.00 % -0.04 % 0.00 % ROAA excluding merger expenses 1.32 % 0.90 % 1.07 % Gain on sale of investment securities 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % Tax effect 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.00 % ROAA excluding gain on sale of investment securities 1.32 % 0.90 % 1.07 % Gain on remeasurement of equity interest in Lafayette 0.00 % -0.05 % 0.00 % Tax effect 0.00 % 0.01 % 0.00 % ROAA excluding gain on remeasurement of equity\ninterest in Lafayette 1.32 % 0.86 % 1.07 % Tax reform bill impact 0.00 % 0.25 % 0.00 % ROAA excluding tax reform bill impact 1.32 % 1.11 % 1.07 % Acquisition-related purchase accounting adjustments (PAUs) -0.21 % -0.09 % -0.13 % Tax effect 0.04 % 0.03 % 0.05 % Core ROAA 1.15 % 1.05 % 0.99 % Non-GAAP Reconciliation of Return on Average Common Equity Average Common Equity $ 460,076 $ 449,318 $ 345,092 Return on average common equity (\"ROACE\") as reported 11.29 % 6.75 % 9.66 % Merger expenses 0.00 % 1.28 % 0.00 % Tax effect 0.00 % -0.37 % 0.00 % ROACE excluding merger expenses 11.29 % 7.66 % 9.66 % Gain on sale of investment securities -0.01 % 0.00 % -0.04 % Tax effect 0.00 % 0.00 % 0.01 % ROACE excluding gain on sale of investment securities 11.28 % 7.66 % 9.63 % Gain on remeasurement of equity interest in Lafayette 0.00 % -0.47 % 0.00 % Tax effect 0.00 % 0.07 % 0.00 % ROACE excluding gain on remeasurement of equity\ninterest in Lafayette 11.28 % 7.26 % 9.63 % Tax reform bill impact 0.00 % 2.14 % 0.00 % ROACE excluding tax reform bill impact 11.28 % 9.40 % 9.63 % Acquisition-related purchase accounting adjustments (\"PAUs\") -1.80 % -0.77 % -1.19 % Tax effect 0.38 % 0.27 % 0.42 % Core ROACE 9.86 % 8.90 % 8.86 %\nAbout Horizon\nHorizon Bancorp is an independent, commercial bank holding company serving northern and central Indiana, and southern, central and the Great Lakes Bay regions of Michigan through its commercial banking subsidiary Horizon Bank.
