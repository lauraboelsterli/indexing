    "text": "1 COMMENTS Lawrence, Kan.\nIn an odd and turbulent political year, no state has more odd and turbulent forces in play than does Kansas.\nKansas, as reliably red as any state in the nation in recent years, could elect a Democrat to the U.S. House this year for the first time in a decade. It might even elect two. That’s as good a sign as any of the Democratic tide building in 2018.\nThe state’s congressional delegation and its farmers, generally friendly to Republican President Donald Trump, are squirming over the damage the trade war the president threatens with China could do to agriculture markets . The political consequences of that unease are yet to play out.\nNewsletter Sign-up Meanwhile, Kansas is staging its own version of the national tax-cut debate, though at a more advanced stage. The state legislature passed its own big tax cut six years ago, then last year reversed it amid persistent fiscal problems and a school-funding crisis, and now is debating whether to partially roll back taxes again.\nAbove all, Kansas hosts one of the year’s most intriguing governor’s races. It features Gov. Jeff Colyer, a pleasant, pro-business, antiabortion, Reagan-admiring physician, who in more normal times would be considered the unquestioned conservative champion. But he is being attacked from the right by the state’s hard-edge, Trump-friendly secretary of state, Kris Kobach, who is best known not for his work in the state but outside of it on national immigration and voter-identification causes —and who recently was found to be in contempt of court in a voting-rights case.\nWaiting in the wings are newly optimistic Democrats, though their prospects are clouded by a wealthy independent candidate, Greg Orman, who could play the role of spoiler in the governor’s race.\nAll told, it’s quite the political stew. Much of it is a reaction to the era of Sam Brownback, the former U.S. senator who was elected governor in 2010, and immediately sponsored a big tax cut, which he argued would lure in businesses and usher in robust growth.\nInstead, in part because lawmakers bought into the tax cut but not some of the offsetting measures Mr. Brownback proposed to lessen the revenue loss, fiscal problems arose and persisted. Ratings on state debt were downgraded. Economic growth disappointed, and public dissatisfaction grew as education funding was squeezed.\nRelated Video The Democrats have a \"blue wave\" of momentum building for the 2018 midterms, thanks to a motivated base, success in special elections and a low approval rating for President Trump. Will that be enough to take back the House and the Senate? Burdett Loomis, a political-science professor at the University of Kansas, says of Mr. Brownback policies: “Generally, they were considered a failure here.”\nMr. Brownback was re-elected in 2014, but barely, and other conservatives suffered at the polls. Finally, last year, the legislature rolled back much of the tax cut—and Mr. Brownback resigned to head the State Department’s Office of International Religious Freedom.\nThat brought to office Mr. Colyer, who had been lieutenant governor. He has moved quickly to improve relations with the state legislature and establish an image as a low-key problem-solver. In an interview, he describes Kansans’ view of state government as: “We have challenges here. Fix them.” The influential Kansas City Star, which had been critical of Mr. Brownback, wrote in a Sunday editorial praising Mr. Colyer: “On key issues, he’s demonstrated steady and productive leadership.”\nYet, oddly, the governor finds he has lower name identification at this point than does Mr. Kobach, who has become well-known for a relentless focus on illegal immigration. He helped Arizona write a tough-on-immigration law, worked on homeland-security issues for the Trump transition and was co-chairman of a now-disbanded national commission investigating voter fraud.\nMr. Kobach has carried those issues into the governor’s race, along with full-throated defense of gun owners. He has invited the National Rifle Association to meet in Kansas, and he hosted a gun-rights rally at which he declared that students marching for greater protections against gun violence in schools should “stay in class and spend that half hour studying the history of the Second Amendment.” Mr. Kobach seems intent on ensuring that “nobody’s getting around him on the right,” Mr. Loomis says.\nThe question, though, is whether Kansans are moving back toward a more centrist politics—and the biggest test is over school funding. After the Kansas Supreme Court ruled that the state hadn’t met its constitutional requirements to adequately fund education, the legislature in early April narrowly passed a bill boosting school funding by $534 million.\nMr. Colyer, sensing public unease with the state of schools, has embraced the increase, arguing that improving state finances make it affordable and that improved education is necessary to provide trained workers needed by a now-expanding business sector. Mr. Kobach has called the plan a disaster.\n“The two big issues for us are education and growing the economy,” Mr. Colyer says. (Mr. Kobach’s campaign didn’t respond to multiple requests for an interview.) Their battle reflects the unsettled political climate of Kansas—but also the national struggle of a Republican Party still seeking its identity in the Trump era.\nWrite to Gerald F.
