    "text": "April 6, 2018 / 9:02 AM / Updated 7 hours ago Man City's style convinced De Bruyne to snub Bayern, PSG   Manchester City’s playing style convinced playmaker Kevin De Bruyne to snub top European teams and join the Premier League club, the 26-year-old said ahead of Saturday’s potential title-clinching derby against Manchester United. Soccer Football - Champions League - Manchester City Press Conference - Anfield, Liverpool, Britain - April 3, 2018 Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne during the press conference Action Images via Reuters/Carl Recine \nThe Belgium international, who joined City from Wolfsburg in 2015, has notched 11 goals and 20 assists across all competitions for the league leaders this season. \nDe Bruyne said Germany’s Bayern Munich and French side Paris St Germain were among the teams he turned down to move to City. \n“I had the option of going to Munich, PSG or staying in Wolfsburg. But I thought for me the probability of the type of football that I can play at City will suit me the best,” De Bruyne told BBC’s Premier League show. \nThe move has paid off with De Bruyne, who leads the league’s assist charts this campaign, on the verge of winning his third trophy at City in as many seasons. Soccer Football - Champions League Quarter Final First Leg - Liverpool vs Manchester City - Anfield, Liverpool, Britain - April 4, 2018 Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola gives instructions to Kevin De Bruyne REUTERS/Andrew Yates \nManager Pep Guardiola’s side have lost just once this campaign and hold a 16-point lead over second-placed United and De Bruyne believes that clinching the league title against their bitter rivals would add to City’s joy. \n“It would help us if we win it against United. It’s maybe better for the future,” he added. \n“Fans will mock each other, that is the way it goes. So for them it’s the biggest thing.” \nCity are also competing in the Champions League quarter-finals, where they lost 3-0 at Liverpool in the first leg on Wednesday.
