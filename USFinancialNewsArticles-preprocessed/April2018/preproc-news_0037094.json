    "text": "QUINCY, Calif., April 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Plumas Bancorp (Nasdaq:PLBC), the parent company of Plumas Bank, today announced first quarter 2018 earnings of $3.3 million or $0.65 per share, an increase of $1.2 million from $2.1 million or $0.42 per share during the first quarter of 2017. The $3.3 million in net income represents the largest net income for any one quarter in the Company’s history. Diluted earnings per share increased to $0.63 per share during the three months ended March 31, 2018 from $0.40 per share during the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Return on average equity increased to 23.6% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, up from 16.9% during the first quarter of 2017. Return on average assets was 1.82% during the current quarter, up from 1.26% during the first quarter of 2017.\n“On behalf of the Board of Directors, I am very pleased to report that the Company delivered record earnings performance in the first quarter of 2018,” commented Andrew J. Ryback, director, president and chief executive officer of Plumas Bancorp and Plumas Bank. “We continued our strong performance in the first quarter by achieving increases in interest income, non-interest income, pretax income and net income. These achievements are reflective of our team’s continued hard work and dedication to meeting the needs of our clients and helping them attain their financial goals.”\nRyback added, “We are extremely proud to announce that our Company was recently recognized by two prestigious firms. First, Raymond James and Associates awarded Plumas Bancorp with the Community Bankers Cup for operating one of the top performing community banks in the country. After evaluating 272 banks and awarding 28 (the top 10%) with the Cup, we were thrilled that Plumas Bancorp ranked 5 th overall. One of the key takeaways of their analyses was our five-year stock performance. With our stock price increasing over 600%, we significantly outperformed all of the other Cup winners. Secondly, for the third consecutive year, Plumas Bank was named a ‘Super Premier’ performing bank in 2017 by the Findley Reports. This recognition was based upon multiple factors, including profitability, return on equity and loan performance. We were very pleased that our efforts are being recognized both regionally and nationally.”\nRyback continued, “In addition to our financial news, Plumas Bank has some other news to report. April is Community Banking month and Plumas Bank is sharing the ‘Bank Local’ message throughout our footprint. Banking local creates a symbiotic relationship between community banks and the communities that they serve. Funds taken in as deposits by community banks are put to productive use by being lent back out into the local economy — to small businesses, individuals and families. By advocating for banking local, we are encouraging our clients to put their money to work in the communities that they call home. Finally, April is Financial Literacy month. Our website, plumasbank.com , offers tips on how to manage and protect your money, while our branch offices have a variety of financial materials on hand for clients and local citizens to take and share with family and friends. Our goal is to educate for financial success.”\nRyback continued, “While educating our clients and communities on financial health is a major initiative, we are also very focused on the health and well-being of our employees; for the past two years, Plumas Bank has offered a robust corporate wellness plan that provides incentives for our team members to live more active, healthy lives. Our employees have embraced the program and continue to develop fun, creative ways to challenge each other to obtain their wellness goals. And in addition to investing in their physical wellness, Plumas Bank is also investing in the financial wellness of our team by expanding our bonus plan beyond corporate officers to include all employees.”\nRyback concluded, “As we share a glimpse of what our Company is doing to create a successful environment for our employees, clients, shareholders and communities, rest assured that we are well-positioned to continue our solid financial performance and take advantage of, appropriate growth opportunities.”\nFinancial Highlights\nMarch 31, 2018 compared to March 31, 2017\nTotal assets increased by $73 million, or 11%, to $737 million.

The three largest areas of growth in the Company’s loan portfolio were $10.1 million in real estate construction loans, $8.5 million in automobile loans and $6.3 million in agricultural loans. The largest decrease was $4.6 million in residential real estate loans.\nTotal deposits increased by $63.5 million from $589 million at March 31, 2017 to $653 million at March 31, 2018. This $63.5 million increase includes increases of $26.8 million in non-interest bearing demand deposits, $7.7 million in interest bearing transaction accounts and $34.6 million in money market and savings accounts. Non-interest bearing demand deposits totaled 41% of the Bank’s total deposits at March 31, 2018. Time deposits declined by $5.6 million to $42.4 million or 7% of total deposits. The Company has no brokered deposits.\nTotal investment securities increased by $37.3 million from $110.9 million at March 31, 2017 to $148.2 million at March 31, 2018. Cash and due from banks increased by $12.7 million from $52.0 million at March 31, 2017 to $64.7 million at March 31, 2018.\nAsset Quality\nNonperforming assets (which are comprised of nonperforming loans, other real estate owned (“OREO”) and repossessed vehicle holdings) at March 31, 2018 were $2.1 million, down from $3.8 million at March 31, 2017. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets decreased to 0.29% at March 31, 2018 down from 0.57% at March 31, 2017.

Nonperforming loans at March 31, 2018 were $1.0 million, down $2.1 million, or 68% from $3.1 million at March 31, 2017. Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans decreased to 0.21% at March 31, 2018, down from 0.66% at March 31, 2017.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 we recorded a provision for loan losses of $200 thousand. Net charge-offs totaled $247 thousand and $6 thousand during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The allowance for loan losses totaled $6.6 million at March 31, 2018 and $6.7 million at March 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans decreased from 1.43% at March 31, 2017 to 1.35% at March 31, 2018 related to a decline in specific reserves on impaired loans.\nShareholders’ Equity\nTotal shareholders’ equity increased by $6.8 million from $50.5 million at March 31, 2017 to $57.3 million at March 31, 2018. The $6.8 million includes earnings during the twelve-month period totaling $9.4 million, the reclassification from other compressive loss to retained earnings of $0.1 million in stranded tax effects from a change in Federal tax rates and stock option activity totaling $0.4 million. These items were partially offset by a decrease in net unrealized gains on investment securities of $1.7 million and cash dividends totaling $1.4 million consisting of two dividends of $0.14 per share one paid in May of 2017 and the other paid in November 2017.\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income, on a nontax-equivalent basis, was $7.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $1.1 million, or 16%, from $6.5 million for the same period in 2017. Interest income increased by $1.1 million, the largest component of which was an increase in interest and fees on loans of $669 thousand. This increase in interest and fees on loans was related to an increase in average loan balances of $27 million and an increase in yield on loans of 26 basis points from 5.36% during the 2017 quarter to 5.62% during the current quarter. Net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased 22 basis points to 4.52%, up from 4.30% for the same period in 2017.\nNon-Interest Income/Expense\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, non-interest income totaled $2.5 million, an increase of $484 thousand from the three months ended March 31, 2017. Gains on sale of SBA loans increased by $138 thousand from $528 thousand during the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $666 thousand during the current quarter. Proceeds from SBA loan sales totaled $11.9 million during the current quarter and $9.2 million during the 2017 quarter. Loans originated for sale totaled $12.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and $11.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017. Non-interest income also includes a $209 thousand gain recorded upon the prospective adoption of a newly effective accounting pronouncement impacting the measurement of equity securities, which in our case consists of stock in our correspondent banks, without a readily determinable fair market value.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, total non-interest expense increased by $366 thousand, or 7%, to $5.4 million, up from $5.1 million for the comparable period in 2017. Salary and benefit expense increased by $186 thousand the largest component of which was a $105 thousand increase in accrued bonus expense. Professional fees increased by $60 thousand related to a $20 thousand increase in accrued audit expense and a $35 thousand increase in consulting expense. The increase in accrued audit expense includes costs associated with the annual audit of internal control over financial reporting which is required for public companies who are accelerated filers. We recently met this requirement. The increase in consulting costs primarily represents costs related to an external review of our compliance management system and ongoing bank compliance consulting. In addition, other non-interest expense included a $50 thousand increase to the reserve for undisbursed loan commitments related to an increase in total loan commitments as the Bank continues to grow it loan portfolio.\nFounded in 1980, Plumas Bank is a locally owned and managed full-service community bank headquartered in Northeastern California.
