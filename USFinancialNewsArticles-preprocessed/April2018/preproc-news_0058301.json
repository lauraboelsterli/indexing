and free cash flow. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS exclude the impact of amortization expense, share-based compensation expense, restructuring and acquisition-related, excess tax benefit, and adjustment to tax valuation allowance items. Free cash flow excludes capital expenditures and dividends paid. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of recurring business results including significant non-cash expenses. We believe management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow for greater transparency with respect to key measures used by management in its financial and operating decision-making.\nFAIR ISAAC CORPORATION\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP GUIDANCE\n(In millions, except per share data)\n(Unaudited)\nPrevious Fiscal 2018 Guidance\nUpdated Fiscal 2018 Guidance\nGAAP net income\n$ 136\n$ 140\nAmortization of intangible assets\n7\n7\nStock-based compensation expense\n67\n76\nIncome tax adjustments\n(16)\n(21)\nExcess tax benefit\n(20)\n(20)\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\n17\n17\nNon-GAAP net income\n$ 191\n$ 200\nGAAP diluted earnings per share\n$ 4.34\n$ 4.47\nAmortization of intangible assets\n0.22\n0.22\nStock-based compensation expense\n2.14\n2.44\nIncome tax adjustments\n(0.52)\n(0.66)\nExcess tax benefit\n(0.64)\n(0.64)\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\n0.54\n0.54\nNon-GAAP diluted earnings per share\n$ 6.09\n$ 6.38\nNote: The numbers may not sum to total due to rounding.\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the consolidated GAAP financial statements, the company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP EPS, and free cash flow.
