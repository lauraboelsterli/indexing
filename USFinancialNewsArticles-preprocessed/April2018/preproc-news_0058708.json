    "text": "IRVINE, Calif., April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- CalAmp (NASDAQ: CAMP), a telematics pioneer leading transformation in a global connected economy, today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended February 28, 2018.\n\"We achieved several transformative business and operational milestones during fiscal 2018, realizing record revenues and delivering strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flows,\" said Michael Burdiek, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We realigned our global sales organization, armed our team with a comprehensive suite of SaaS solutions, and succeeded on closing several global enterprise opportunities in multiple market verticals. We are realizing the benefits of our investments and have a strong foundation to drive long-term profitable growth and increased recurring revenue.\"\nFourth Quarter and Fiscal 2018 Financial Highlights\nConsolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $94.4 million, up 10% year over year. Telematics Systems revenue for the fourth quarter was $78.3 million, driven by growth in our MRM Telematics product revenue, up 29% year over year. Software & Subscription Services revenue for the fourth quarter was $16.1 million, driven by 31% year over year revenue growth in our LoJack Italia business. International revenue for fiscal 2018 was $100.3 million, up 10% year over year and representing 27% of consolidated revenue. Adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2018 was $52.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA margin was 14%. Free cash flows for fiscal 2018 was $58.6 million including a non-operating gain of $28.3 million from a settlement with a former LoJack supplier, which represents an increase of 228% over the prior year. Operating cash flow of $66.9 million, an increase of 159% over the prior year.\nBusiness Highlights\nWe partnered with Trimble to provide customized telematics and device management systems designed for high-value asset tracking to support a wide array of field service management and asset monitoring applications. We announced the nationwide availability of LoJack's next generation of dual-mode telematics and SVR technology that combines connected car features and real-time CrashBoxx accident reporting with the proprietary LoJack Stolen Vehicle Recovery System, all supported by LoJack's unique law enforcement ecosystem. We announced a partnership with TransUnion to monetize the installed base of dormant LoJack devices, enabling stolen vehicle recovery to benefit both insurance companies and their consumers. This is a fundamental step in expanding CalAmp's total addressable market through data monetization of the installed base of millions of LoJack and CalAmp devices. LoJack Italia entered into an agreement to provide real-time vehicle data and crash management capabilities to European fleet management and long-term lease leader ALD Automotive Italia (\"ALD\"), making LoJack Italia the primary supplier of telematics solutions to ALD customers in Italy. We received $13.3 million of net proceeds in April 2018 from a legal settlement with a former LoJack supplier. We expect to receive the final payment of $5.0 million of additional net proceeds in fiscal 2019 thereby further contributing to our strong free cash flows.\nSummary Financial Information:\n(In thousands except per share amounts)\nThree Months Ended\nYear Ended\nFebruary 28,\nFebruary 28,\nDescription\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nRevenues:\nTelematics Systems\n$\n78,285\n$\n70,912\n$\n302,126\n$\n274,314\nSoftware & Subscription Services\n16,110\n15,214\n63,786\n61,719\nSatellite (1)\n-\n-\n-\n15,069\n$\n94,395\n$\n86,126\n$\n365,912\n$\n351,102\nGross margin\n41%\n42%\n41%\n41%\nNet income (loss)\n$\n(4,767)\n$\n(4,239)\n$\n16,617\n$\n(7,904)\nNet income (loss) per diluted share\n$\n(0.13)\n$\n(0.12)\n$\n0.46\n$\n(0.22)\nNon-GAAP measures:\nAdjusted basis net income\n$\n10,949\n$\n9,852\n$\n42,161\n$\n38,557\nAdjusted basis net income per diluted share\n$\n0.30\n$\n0.28\n$\n1.17\n$\n1.06\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n13,062\n$\n12,831\n$\n52,382\n$\n49,368\nAdjusted EBITDA margin\n14%\n15%\n14%\n14%\n(1) The Satellite business ceased operations effective August 31, 2016.\nAs of February 28,\nDescription\n2018\n2017\nCash and marketable securities\n$\n156,003\n$\n100,428\nWorking capital\n180,356\n128,864\nDeferred revenue\n34,520\n26,919\n1.625% convertible senior unsecured notes (carrying value)\n154,299\n146,827\nFiscal 2019 First Quarter Business Outlook\n(In thousands except per share amounts)\nRange\nDescription\nLow\nHigh\nGAAP financial information:\nRevenues\n$\n91,000\n$\n95,000\nNet income per diluted share\n$\n0.26\n$\n0.32\nNon-GAAP financial information:\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n12,000\n$\n14,000\nAdjusted basis net income per diluted share\n$\n0.26\n$\n0.32\nEffective March 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue recognition standard entitled Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\").

We use these to enhance the investor's overall understanding of the financial performance and future prospects of our core business activities. Management does not believe that these items are reflective of our underlying performance. However, internally, these non-GAAP measures are significant measures used by management for purposes of evaluating our core operating performance, establishing internal budgets, calculating return on investment for development programs and growth initiatives, comparing performance with internal forecasts and targeted business models, strategic planning, evaluating and valuing potential acquisition candidates and how their operations compare to our operations, and benchmarking performance externally against our competitors.
