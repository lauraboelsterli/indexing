    "text": "TORONTO, April 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ZoomerMedia Limited (TSX-V:ZUM) (the “Company”), the leader in serving the interests of the 45+ “Zoomer” market in Canada, today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended February 28, 2018.\nConsolidated Results\nFor the three months ended February 28, 2018 the Company had revenues of $11.4 million, operating expenses of $11.6 million and negative EBITDA of $0.3 million. Net loss for the three months ended February 28, 2018 was $0.6 million. For the comparative three months ended February 28, 2017 the Company had revenues of $11.8 million, operating expenses of $12.6 million and negative EBITDA of $0.8 million. Net loss for the three months ended February 28, 2017 was $1.0 million.\nFor the six months ended February 28, 2018 the Company had revenues of $25.4 million, operating expenses of $24.2 million and EBITDA of $1.2 million. Net loss for the six months ended February 28, 2018 was $59 thousand. For the comparative six months ended February 28, 2017 the Company had revenues of $26.1 million, operating expenses of $24.8 million and EBITDA of $1.3 million. Net income for the six months ended February 28, 2017 was $177 thousand.\nEBITDA is a non-IFRS earnings measure which does not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to EBITDA presented by other companies. EBITDA represents earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. This measure is important to management since it is used by potential investors to evaluate the Company’s operating performance and ability to incur and service debt, and as a valuation metric. Investors are cautioned that this non-IFRS financial measure should not be construed as an alternative to other measures of financial performance calculated in accordance with IFRS.\nAdditional Information\nDetailed financial information and Management’s Discussion and Analysis for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 can be found on SEDAR’s website at www.sedar.com . The financial information included in this release is qualified in its entirety and should be read together with the interim consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, including the notes thereto.\nAbout ZoomerMedia Limited\nZoomerMedia is a multimedia company that serves the 45plus “Zoomer” demographic through television, radio, magazine, internet and trade shows.
