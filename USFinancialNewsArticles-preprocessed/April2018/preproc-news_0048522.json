As the company has recently implemented new accounting standards, including the standards relating to revenue recognition and retirement benefits, 2017 financial information has been adjusted. Reported first quarter 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.14 compared to $0.99 reported in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter adjusted net income excluding special items such as merger-related costs, an employee bonus awarded in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and mark-to-market fuel hedge accounting adjustments was $18 million, compared to $124 million in the first quarter of 2017. This quarter's adjusted results compare to the First Call analyst consensus estimate of $0.12 per share. Paid a $0.32 per-share quarterly cash dividend in the first quarter, a 7% increase over the dividend paid in the first quarter of 2017. Repurchased a total of 185,661 shares of common stock for approximately $12 million in the first three months of 2018. Generated approximately $310 million of operating cash flow and used approximately $235 million for capital expenditures, resulting in approximately $75 million of free cash flow for the first three months of 2018. Held $1.5 billion in unrestricted cash and marketable securities as of March 31, 2018.\nOperational Highlights:\nObtained a single operating certificate (SOC) from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for Alaska Airlines and Virgin America, our most significant integration milestone to date. The SOC recognizes Alaska and Virgin America as one airline. Reached an agreement in early April 2018 with mainline flight attendants that includes a merger transition plan and a two-year extension from December 2019 to December 2021. The agreement provides pay increases and paves the way to fully align nearly 5,700 mainline flight attendants under a single agreement. Expanded our codeshare partnerships with Japan Airlines, Fiji Airways, Cathay Pacific and Finnair. Began installation of next-generation Gogo satellite-based Wi-Fi in the first quarter of 2018, which will provide guests a faster internet connection across the Boeing and Airbus fleets. Added one Boeing 737-900ER aircraft and two Airbus A321neo aircraft to the mainline operating fleet in the first quarter of 2018. Added one Embraer 175 (E175) regional jet to Horizon Air's fleet in the first quarter of 2018 and added two E175 aircraft operated by SkyWest Airlines.\nRecognition and Awards:\nRanked No. 1 in the \"Airline Quality Rating\" of performance and quality for the second year in a row — a study performed by Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University focused on four major areas of airline performance.

We believe that consideration of these non-GAAP financial measures may be important to investors for the following reasons:\nBy eliminating fuel expense and certain special items (including merger-related costs) from our unit metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of operations and our non-fuel cost-reduction initiatives. Our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can result in a significant improvement in operating results. In addition, we believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run, so it is important for management (and thus investors) to understand the impact of (and trends in) company-specific cost drivers such as labor rates and productivity, airport costs, maintenance costs, etc., which are more controllable by management. Cost per ASM (CASM) excluding fuel and certain special items, such as merger-related costs, is one of the most important measures used by management and by the Air Group Board of Directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance. Adjusted income before income tax and CASM excluding fuel (and other items as specified in our plan documents) are important metrics for the employee incentive plan, which covers the majority of Air Group employees. CASM excluding fuel and certain special items is a measure commonly used by industry analysts, and we believe it is the basis by which they compare our airlines to others in the industry. The measure is also the subject of frequent questions from investors. Disclosure of the individual impact of certain noted items provides investors the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without these special items. We believe that disclosing the impact of certain items, such as merger-related costs and mark-to-market hedging adjustments, is important because it provides information on significant items that are not necessarily indicative of future performance. Industry analysts and investors consistently measure our performance without these items for better comparability between periods and among other airlines. Although we disclose our passenger unit revenues, we do not (nor are we able to) evaluate unit revenues excluding the impact that changes in fuel costs have had on ticket prices. Fuel expense represents a large percentage of our total operating expenses. Fluctuations in fuel prices often drive changes in unit revenues in the mid-to-long term. Although we believe it is useful to evaluate non-fuel unit costs for the reasons noted above, we would caution readers of these financial statements not to place undue reliance on unit costs excluding fuel as a measure or predictor of future profitability because of the significant impact of fuel costs on our business.\nGLOSSARY OF TERMS\nAircraft Utilization - block hours per day; this represents the average number of hours per day our aircraft are in transit\nAircraft Stage Length - represents the average miles flown per aircraft departure\nASMs - available seat miles, or \"capacity\"; represents total seats available across the fleet multiplied by the number of miles flown\nCASM - operating costs per ASM, or \"unit cost\"; represents all operating expenses including fuel and special items\nCASMex - operating costs excluding fuel and special items per ASM; this metric is used to help track progress toward reduction of non-fuel operating costs since fuel is largely out of our control\nDebt-to-capitalization ratio - represents adjusted debt (long-term debt plus the present value of future operating lease payments) divided by total equity plus adjusted debt\nDiluted Earnings per Share - represents earnings per share (EPS) using fully diluted shares outstanding\nDiluted Shares - represents the total number of shares that would be outstanding if all possible sources of conversion, such as stock options, were exercised\nEconomic Fuel - best estimate of the cash cost of fuel, net of the impact of our fuel-hedging program\nFree Cash Flow - total operating cash flow generated less cash paid for capital expenditures\nLoad Factor - RPMs as a percentage of ASMs; represents the number of available seats that were filled with paying passengers\nMainline - represents flying Boeing 737 and Airbus 320 family jets and all associated revenues and costs\nProductivity - number of revenue passengers per full-time equivalent employee\nRASM - operating revenue per ASMs, or \"unit revenue\"; operating revenue includes all passenger revenue, freight & mail, Mileage Plan and other ancillary revenue; represents the average total revenue for flying one seat one mile\nRegional - represents capacity purchased by Alaska from Horizon, SkyWest and PenAir.
