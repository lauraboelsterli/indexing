    "text": "GOLETA, Calif., April 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Community West Bancshares (Community West or the Company), (NASDAQ:CWBC), parent company of Community West Bank (Bank), today reported net income increased 33.8% to $1.8 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018 (1Q18), compared to $1.4 million, or $0.16 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17) and $449,000, or $0.05 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017 (4Q17).\n“We continue to see solid growth opportunities in the Central Coast markets we serve,” stated Martin E. Plourd, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Assets grew 15.7% to $865.7 million over prior year, contributing to increased revenues and profitability for the first quarter of the year. Total loans increased 11.6% year over year and generated an above-industry net interest margin. We had a good year, but noted an economic slowdown in the first quarter primarily from the impact in our local economy from the fires and debris slides.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nNet income increased 33.8% to $1.8 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, in 1Q18, compared to $1.4 million, or $0.16 per diluted share in 1Q17. Return on average common equity of 10.30%. Return on average assets of 0.91%. Net loans increased $11.1 million to $737.3 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $726.2 million three months earlier and increased $76.6 million compared to $660.8 million a year ago. Total deposits increased $10.4 million to $710.0 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $699.7 million three months earlier and increased $69.9 million compared to $640.1 million a year ago. Net interest margin was 4.25%. Book value per common share increased to $8.73 at March 31, 2018, compared to $8.22 a year ago. The Bank continues to be well-capitalized per banking regulations with its total capital ratio at 11.38%, its Tier 1 capital ratio at 10.19% and Tier 1 leverage ratio at 8.96% at March 31, 2018.\nIncome Statement\nFirst quarter net interest margin was 4.25% compared to 4.26% in 4Q17 and 4.45% in 1Q17. “Our net interest margin remained stable during the quarter, despite compression compared to the year ago quarter,” said Susan C. Thompson, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nNet interest income for 1Q18 was $8.4 million, compared to $8.5 million in the preceding quarter and a 7.4% increase compared to $7.8 million in 1Q17. Non-interest income was $639,000 in 1Q18, compared to $896,000 in 4Q17 and $641,000 in 1Q17.\nNon-interest expenses totaled $6.5 million in 1Q18, compared to $6.4 million in 4Q17 and $5.9 million in 1Q17. The year-over-year increase was largely due to an increase in salary and employee benefits.\nBalance Sheet\n“Net loans increased 1.5% during the quarter and increased 11.6% year over year, with good production in targeted loan types, including commercial real estate, manufactured housing and commercial loans,” said Plourd. “We continue to be encouraged by the robust economic activity in the markets that we serve and see potential for additional growth.”\nNet loans increased to $737.3 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $726.2 million at December 31, 2017, and increased $76.6 million compared to $660.8 million a year ago. Commercial real estate loans outstanding were up 19.2% from year ago levels to $362.2 million at March 31, 2018, and comprise 48.6% of the total loan portfolio. Manufactured housing loans were up 13.3% from year ago levels to $229.2 million and represent 30.7% of total loans. Commercial loans increased 6.0% from year ago levels to $109.8 million and represent 14.7% of the total loan portfolio.\nDeposits increased 1.5% to $710.0 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $699.7 million at December 31, 2017, and increased $69.9 million, or 10.9% compared to $640.1 million a year earlier. Non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased 15.3% to $118.2 million, at March 31, 2018, when compared to the prior year. Core deposits, defined as non-interest-bearing checking, interest-bearing checking, money market accounts, savings accounts and retail certificates of deposit totaled $485.7 million at March 31, 2018 and comprise 68.4% of total deposits.\nTotal assets were $865.7 million at March 31, 2018, a $32.4 million increase compared to three months earlier and a $117.4 million, or 15.7% increase compared to $748.3 million one year ago.

Book value per common share improved to $8.73 at March 31, 2017, compared to $8.55 at December 31, 2017, and $8.22 a year ago.\nCredit Quality\n“We had net loan recoveries again during the quarter, and as a result we recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $144,000 in the first quarter,” said Thompson. This compares to a negative provision for loan losses of $12,000 in 4Q17 and a provision for loan losses of $144,000 in 1Q17. Net loan recoveries were $182,000 in 1Q18 compared to $120,000 in 4Q17 and $177,000 in 1Q17.\nThe allowance for loan losses was $8.5 million at March 31, 2018, or 1.22% of total loans held for investment, compared to 1.24% at December 31, 2017, and 1.28% a year ago. Net nonaccrual loans were $4.2 million, or 0.57% of total loans at March 31, 2018, compared to $4.5 million, or 0.61% of total loans, three months earlier, and to $2.3 million, or 0.34% of total loans, a year ago. The increase in nonaccrual loans was primarily in the commercial loan segment.\nOf the $4.2 million in net nonaccrual loans, $2.5 million were commercial loans primarily from one relationship and not systemic to the whole portfolio, $527,000 were commercial agricultural loans, $347,000 were manufactured housing loans, $210,000 were home equity loans, $175,000 were SBA 504 1st loans, $172,000 were single-family real estate loans, $166,000 were SBA 7A loans and $117,000 were commercial real estate loans.\nOther assets acquired through foreclosure totaled $233,000 at March 31, 2018, compared to $372,000 three months earlier and $145,000 a year earlier.\nCash Dividend Declared\nThe Company’s Board of Directors increased its quarterly cash dividend by 25% to $0.05 per common share, payable May 31, 2018 to common shareholders of record on May 11, 2018.
