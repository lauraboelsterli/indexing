    "text": "BOTHELL, Wash., Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALDR) (“Alder” or the “Company”), a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of migraine, today announced it has appointed Erin Lavelle to the newly created role of Chief Operating Officer, effective April 16, 2018.\nMs. Lavelle brings to Alder 20 years of cross-functional experience leading strategic and operational initiatives in the biopharmaceutical industry. She will be responsible for leading the Company’s operational strategies and planning, and driving continued progress towards the commercialization of eptinezumab. She will report to Paul B. Cleveland, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer.\nMs. Lavelle most recently served as the General Manager of Amgen’s Taiwan affiliate, where she was responsible for managing a portfolio of six commercialized products and leading a team of 80 cross-functional colleagues. Prior to that role, Ms. Lavelle was based in Hong Kong as an Executive Director for the Japan Asia-Pacific region, leading Commercial Excellence and Digital Health, where she was responsible for establishing the business analytics team, the brand strategy process and the region’s governance model during the region’s initial build. Prior to that, she held roles as Executive Director in the areas of Global Marketing, Global Commercial Finance and Strategy, and Corporate Development. Ms. Lavelle began her career in 1998 as an investment banker in the healthcare group at Merrill Lynch & Co. Ms. Lavelle holds a Bachelor of Arts in Economics from Yale University.\n“We are very pleased to have Erin join the Alder team and look forward to benefiting from her experience implementing strategic and operational initiatives to drive commercial development as we enter the next phase of Alder’s growth,” said Mr. Cleveland. “Erin brings a proven track record of managing complex operations within the biopharmaceutical industry, and her appointment to the newly-created COO role is another significant step in Alder’s process to build out our team with talented leaders to ensure we are well-positioned for a successful commercialization of eptinezumab.”\n“I am excited to join Alder at such an important point in the Company’s path toward commercialization,” said Ms. Lavelle. “Eptinezumab represents a meaningful opportunity to transform treatment for migraine patients, and I look forward to working alongside Alder’s talented team of scientists, physicians and employees.”\nAbout Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.\nAlder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc., is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to transforming the treatment paradigm for patients with migraine and other serious neurological or inflammatory conditions. Leveraging its pioneering monoclonal antibody technologies, Alder discovers and develops novel therapeutic antibodies designed to deliver highly differentiated, best-in-class clinical profiles. Alder's lead pivotal-stage product candidate, eptinezumab, is being evaluated as potentially the first-to-market migraine prevention infusion therapy. Eptinezumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) inhibiting calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which is believed to play a key role in mediating and initiating migraine. Alder is additionally evaluating ALD1910, a preclinical product candidate also in development as a migraine prevention therapy. ALD1910 is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-38 (PACAP-38), another protein that is active in mediating the initiation of migraine. Clazakizumab, Alder's third program, is a monoclonal antibody candidate that inhibits interleukin-6 and is licensed to Vitaeris, Inc.
