His value and leadership became quickly apparent to me and to our Board of Directors. Our shareholders and the broader community will soon be witness to Phil’s creativity and product development acumen, as he moves into the CEO role.”\nBosua said, “The time I have spent in the Visualant lab working on advancing their technology has been some of the most scintillating moments of my career. Ron Erickson and Visualant have provided support to allow me and the lab team to explore new products and discover new technologies. I’m excited by the technology platform we are creating, knowing that it will benefit millions of people around the world and be equally as good for our shareholders.”\nAbout Visualant, Inc .\nVisualant™ is a public company whose shares trade under the stock symbol “VSUL.” The Visualant technology directs structured light or radio waves through a substance or material to capture a unique molecular signature.
