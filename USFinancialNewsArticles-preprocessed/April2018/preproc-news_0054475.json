(NYSE:RS) today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nNet sales of $2.76 billion set a new Company record, and were up 14.0% from $2.42 billion in the first quarter of 2017 and up 16.0% from $2.38 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. Tons sold were a record at 1.6 million tons, up 3.6% from the first quarter of 2017 and up 10.0% from the fourth quarter of 2017, with the average selling price per ton sold up 10.3% from the first quarter of 2017 and up 5.6% from the fourth quarter of 2017. Gross profit dollars were a record $819.9 million with a gross profit margin of 29.7%, compared to 29.8% in the first quarter of 2017 and 28.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017. FIFO gross profit margin was 30.6%, compared to 30.2% in the first quarter of 2017 and 28.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income attributable to Reliance was $169.0 million, compared to $111.7 million in the first quarter of 2017 and $301.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income attributable to Reliance in the fourth quarter of 2017 included a provisional/one-time income tax benefit of $207.3 million as a result of the December 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform”). Earnings per diluted share were $2.30, compared to $1.52 in the first quarter of 2017 and $4.09 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, earnings per diluted share were $1.28 for the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $2.30, up 51.3% from $1.52 in the first quarter of 2017 and up 88.5% from $1.22 in the fourth quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate was 24.0%, compared to 32.7% in the first quarter of 2017 and 20.0%, excluding the impact of Tax Reform, in the fourth quarter of 2017. Cost of sales includes a pre-tax net LIFO inventory valuation charge, or expense, of $25.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $10.0 million in the first quarter of 2017 and $4.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Cash flow from operations was $13.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 and net debt-to-total capital was 28.6% at March 31, 2018. Reliance repurchased $50.0 million of its common stock, or 0.6 million shares, at an average cost of $84.38 per share during the first quarter of 2018, and $25.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. A quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share was declared on April 25, 2018 for stockholders of record as of May 25, 2018 and will be payable on June 15, 2018.\nManagement Commentary\n“The positive pricing and demand fundamentals experienced in the fourth quarter of 2017 continued through the first quarter of 2018, with pricing momentum building throughout the quarter. This resulted in record quarterly sales of $2.76 billion, driven by higher selling prices and record volume of 1.6 million tons sold. Our strong gross profit margin of 29.7% along with our record sales generated the highest quarterly gross profit dollars in our Company’s history of $819.9 million,” said Gregg Mollins, President and Chief Executive Officer of Reliance. “Continued strong execution by our managers in the field, supported by the positive business environment, produced the second highest quarterly earnings in our Company’s history of $2.30 per diluted share, exceeding our expectations. If not for the benefit from Tax Reform in the fourth quarter of 2017, our earnings per diluted share of $2.30 in the first quarter of 2018 would have been our highest on record.”\nMr. Mollins continued, “The metal pricing environment remained very strong throughout the quarter, resulting in a 5.6% increase in our average selling price compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, near the high-end of our expected range of 4% to 6%. Strong demand, along with anticipated Section 232 actions, drove higher metal pricing on nearly every product we sell. We experienced a limited amount of pre-buying activity from certain of our customers as a result of the rapid price increases throughout the quarter and concern about metal availability. This pre-buying, coupled with improved demand and the normal seasonal increase in shipping volume during the first quarter, drove a 10.0% increase in our tons sold compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, exceeding the high-end of our expected range by 2%.”\nMr. Mollins concluded, “We are extremely proud of the performance by our managers in the field. Their strong execution resulted in our third highest quarterly pre-tax income dollars ever of $225.2 million, surpassed only by our pre-tax income levels in 2008. We remain encouraged by the positive pricing momentum and improved demand environment. While there is still some uncertainty in the market, we are confident in our ability to maximize opportunities in the current environment with a focus on further increasing value to our stockholders.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Business Metrics (tons in thousands; percentage change) Q1\n2018 Q4\n2017 Sequential\nQuarter\nChange Q1\n2017 Year-Over-\nYear\nChange Tons sold 1,595.7 1,451.0 10.0% 1,540.4 3.6% Tons sold (same-store) 1,593.7 1,449.6 9.9% 1,540.4 3.5% Average selling price per ton sold $1,724 $1,632 5.6% $1,563 10.3% Average selling price per ton sold (same-store) $1,719 $1,628 5.6% $1,563 10.0%\nFirst Quarter 2018 Major Commodity Metrics Tons Sold (tons in thousands; percentage change) Average Selling Price per Ton\nSold (percentage change) Q1 2018\nTons Sold Q4 2017\nTons Sold Sequential\nQuarter\nChange Q1 2017\nTons Sold Year-Over-\nYear Change Sequential\nQuarter\nChange Year-Over-\nYear Change Carbon steel 1,271.8 1,158.8 9.8% 1,235.5 2.9% 6.3% 10.5% Aluminum 98.3 86.9 13.1% 92.7 6.0% 3.3% 7.3% Stainless steel 86.1 75.6 13.9% 79.8 7.9% 1.9% 7.6% Alloy 59.5 53.5 11.2% 56.3 5.7% 3.2% 10.1%\nSales ($'s in millions; percentage change) Q1 2018\nSales Q4 2017\nSales Sequential\nQuarter\nChange Q1 2017\nSales Year-Over-\nYear Change Carbon steel $1,461.2 $1,252.8 16.6% $1,285.5 13.7% Aluminum $550.2 $470.7 16.9% $483.1 13.9% Stainless steel $403.2 $347.7 16.0% $347.3 16.1% Alloy $169.0 $147.4 14.7% $145.3 16.3%\nEnd Market Commentary\nImproved demand, a limited amount of customer pre-buying as a result of announced tariffs, and normal seasonal patterns increased Reliance’s shipments by 10% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, resulting in record quarterly volume of 1.6 million tons sold. Reliance continues to benefit from its strategy of serving a broad spectrum of diverse end markets and providing superior quality products and processing services, generally in small quantities on a just-in-time basis.\nAerospace demand remains strong, and continues to be one of the Company’s top-performing end markets. Reliance maintains its positive outlook for aerospace as build rates and the backlog for orders of commercial planes continues to improve. Reliance expects to continue growing its market share in aerospace given its increased exposure to the defense market and international expansion activities. Automotive demand also remains strong. Reliance services the automotive market mainly through its toll processing operations in the U.S. and Mexico. Reliance maintains its positive outlook for this market as the usage of aluminum in the automotive industry continues to rise. Reliance is well positioned to continue increasing its processing capacity through the Company’s recent investments in new facilities and equipment. Non-residential construction demand, including infrastructure, continues to steadily improve. Reliance remains optimistic that the Administration’s stated focus on infrastructure spending will help strengthen demand in this market. Reliance is well positioned to absorb increased volume into its existing facilities and cost structure as this important end market improves. Heavy industry demand continues to strengthen, with Reliance experiencing ongoing improvements in activity in the industrial equipment markets, primarily related to construction and agricultural equipment. Energy (oil and gas) demand continues to gradually recover for the products Reliance sells into this end market. Rig counts and drilling activity continue to progress and completion activity is gaining strength. Reliance expects to see quoting and overall activity in this market continue to gain traction.\nBalance Sheet & Liquidity\nReliance ended the first quarter of 2018 with total debt outstanding of $2.06 billion, for a net debt-to-total capital ratio of 28.6%. The Company had $757.1 million available for borrowings on its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility at March 31, 2018.\n“We are extremely pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter of 2018,” commented Karla Lewis, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Reliance. “Our strong gross profit margin coupled with the higher pricing and demand environment drove increased earnings that generated positive cash flow from operations of $13.3 million. We typically use cash from operations to build our working capital during the first half of the year, however, our strong execution generated cash from operations. In the first quarter, we completed an acquisition, invested $41.8 million in capital expenditures, paid $38.5 million in dividends and repurchased $50.0 million of our stock. Our balance sheet remains healthy and enables us to continue executing on our growth and stockholder return activities.”\nAcquisition of DuBose National Energy Services, Inc. and DuBose National Energy Fasteners & Machined Parts, Inc.\nAs previously announced, effective March 1, 2018, Reliance acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of DuBose National Energy Services, Inc. (“DuBose Energy”) in Clinton, North Carolina and its affiliate, DuBose National Energy Fasteners & Machined Parts, Inc. (“DuBose Fasteners”) in Cleveland, Ohio. DuBose Energy and DuBose Fasteners specialize in global fabrication, supply and distribution of metal and metal products to the nuclear industry, including utilities, component manufacturers and contractors. The DuBose acquisition aligns with Reliance’s growth strategy of acquiring niche businesses that provide specialty products with high levels of value-added processing at attractive returns. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, the DuBose companies’ combined net sales were $36.3 million.\nStockholder Return Activity\nOn April 25, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share of common stock, payable on June 15, 2018 to stockholders of record as of May 25, 2018. Reliance has paid regular quarterly dividends for 59 consecutive years and has increased the dividend 25 times since its 1994 IPO, including the 11.1% increase effective in the first quarter of 2018.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased $50.0 million of its common stock under its existing share repurchase program at an average cost of $84.38 per share. The Company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in the first quarter of 2017 and repurchased $25.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. At March 31, 2018, approximately 7.5 million shares remained available for repurchase under the Company’s share repurchase program. Reliance expects to continue opportunistically repurchasing shares of its common stock going forward.\nBusiness Outlook\nReliance management remains optimistic in regard to business activity levels in the second quarter of 2018 and anticipates that the end markets in which the Company operates will continue to improve, although shipment levels are expected to be impacted by the pre-buying activity that occurred in the first quarter. As a result, the Company estimates tons sold will be down 1% to up 1% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2018. Reliance management also believes that pricing fundamentals will remain strong. Accordingly, the Company expects its average selling price for the second quarter to be up 5% to 8% compared to the first quarter of 2018. As a result, management currently expects earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.70 for the second quarter of 2018.\nConference Call Details\nA conference call and simultaneous webcast to discuss the first quarter 2018 financial results and business outlook will be held today, April 26, 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time / 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time.

About half of our orders are basic distribution with no processing services performed. For the remainder of our sales orders, we perform “first-stage” processing which is generally not labor intensive as we are simply cutting the metal to size. Because of this, the amount of related labor and overhead, including depreciation and amortization, is not significant and is excluded from our cost of sales. Therefore, our cost of sales is substantially comprised of the cost of the material we sell. We use gross profit and gross profit margin as shown above as measures of operating performance. Gross profit and gross profit margin are important operating and financial measures, as their fluctuations can have a significant impact on our earnings. Gross profit and gross profit margin, as presented, are not necessarily comparable with similarly titled measures for other companies.\n2 See accompanying Non-GAAP earnings and adjusted gross profit

comparisons to the Company's historical performance for its existing and future stockholders. Adjustments include net tax benefit from tax reform, pension settlement charges, settlement gains, impairment and restructuring charges (credits) related to certain of the Company's energy-related businesses and the closure or sale of some of its locations, and gain on sales of non-core property, plant, and equipment, which make comparisons of the Company's operating results between periods difficult using GAAP measures. Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co.'s presentation of gross profit margin - FIFO, which is calculated as gross profit plus net LIFO/LCM expense (or minus net LIFO/LCM income) divided by net sales, is presented in order to provide a means of comparison amongst its competitors who may not use the same inventory valuation method. For further information on the Company's gross profit and gross profit margin, see footnote 1 to the accompanying Selected Unaudited Financial Data.\nSource:Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co.",
