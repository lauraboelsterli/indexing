    "text": "MADRID (Reuters) - Spain’s High Court prosecutor on Thursday asked a judge to bar Swiss bank whistleblower Herve Falciani from leaving Spain before a ruling on whether he will be extradited to Switzerland.\nFILE PHOTO: Herve Falciani, an ex-HSBC employee wanted in Switzerland on charges of stealing data on bank accounts, poses in a restaurant prior to an interview with Reuters in Paris July 17, 2013. REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo The prosecutor said in a statement the recommendation to detain him or “take cautionary measures” was made due to the complexity of the case and because it believed Falciani was a flight risk, which had not previously been the case.\nA ruling from the High Court is expected later.\nOn Wednesday, Spanish police arrested the former employee of HSBC’s Swiss private bank who was convicted of industrial espionage after leaking clients’ tax information.\nThe police acted on an international detention and extradition order from Swiss authorities dated March 19.\nReporting By Jesús Aguado; editing by Paul E.
