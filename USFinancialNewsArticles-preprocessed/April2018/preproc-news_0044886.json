The facility will host our Los Angeles Forwarding, Warehouse, and Distribution operations under one roof. The facility, currently under construction, will be a state-of-the-art cross-dock facility, equipped with 40' ceilings and 68 doors.\nThis facility represents the next wave of forwarding and logistics. Combining throughput philosophies in a cross-dock and forwarding product, coupled with storage capacity in a narrow and vertical environment, we feel we will be able to combine what the industry has done with what the industry will do into one operational viewpoint.\nRIM will take possession of the warehouse portion of the facility, roughly 305,000 square feet, around May 1, 2018, with the office being fully transitioned and functional by July 1, 2018.\nAbout RIM logistics: Founded in 1997, RIM logistics has been a leader in the logistics space, putting best practices to work for our customers.
