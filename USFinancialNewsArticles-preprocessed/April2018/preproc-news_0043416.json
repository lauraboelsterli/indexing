    "text": "LONDON, April 20 (Reuters) - British consumer goods maker Reckitt Benckiser reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales growth on Friday, hurt by further weakness in its Scholl footcare business.\nThe maker of Durex condoms, Lysol disinfectant and Mucinex cold medicine said like-for-like sales rose 2 percent in the first quarter. Analysts were expecting an increase of 2.6 percent, according to a company-supplied consensus.\nReported sales were 3.11 billion pounds ($4.37 billion), just shy of the 3.12 billion in analystsâ€™ consensus.\nThe company stood by its 2018 forecast, which calls for revenue up 13 to 14 percent, with like-for-like sales up 2 to 3 percent. That would be an improvement from sales that were flat in 2017, due to a spate of issues from a product failure to a cyber attack.\n($1 = 0.7111 pounds)\nReporting by Martinne Geller Editing by Edmund Blair\n ",
