    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Energy firm Point Resources, backed by private equity firm HitecVision [HITECH.UL], has hired investment bank BMO Capital Markets to find a minority partner in some of its oil fields in the North Sea, a document drawn up for the company shows.\nThe Norwegian oil producer currently holds a 100-percent operated interest in the Balder and Ringhorne fields and a 77.5 percent interest in Ringhorne East, which it acquired from ExxonMobil ( XOM.N ) in 2017.\nPoint Resources is looking to remain the operator of the assets after the transaction, dubbed “Project Andi”, according to the document reviewed by Reuters.\nBy the end of 2017, the three fields had a combined production of 502 million barrels of oil equivalent.\nInformation documents for the assets will be sent to potential buyers by the end of April, while bids are expected by mid-June, according to the document.\nPoint Resources did not immediately respond to a request for comment. BMO ( BMO.TO ) declined to comment.\nPoint Resources, which was established in 2016, aims to become a leading, independent player on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and targets production of more than 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the mid-2020s.\nWriting by Clara Denina; Editing by Mark Potter\n ",
