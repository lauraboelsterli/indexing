    "text": "TORONTO, April 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Eyereturn Marketing is being recognized as one of Canada's \"Best Workplaces Fewer than 100 Employees\" after an independent evaluation by Great Place to Work®. This was the first year that Eyereturn applied for consideration, and out of the top 50 companies recognized in the category, they ranked 12th.\n\"It was incredibly exciting to not only make it onto the Best Workplaces™ list, but to be ranked so highly. Eyereturn has always been passionate about employee growth and work-life balance, but now we have the data to prove that this is where the value is for our employees,\" says Ian Hewetson, Vice President Sales Torstar and General Manager, Eyereturn. \"Things like summer hours and a dog-friendly office, they are more than just perks, they shape our culture and the way we work.\"\nThe Best Workplaces™ list was based on surveys of over 80,000 employees and cultural assessments of organizations. The list provides crucial data relative to five trust-building dimensions: credibility, respect, fairness, pride, and camaraderie.\nAt its heart, applying for Great Place to Work® is about feedback from employees: knowing which initiatives bring the most value to the employees and finding out where they think there is room for improvement.
