    "text": "27 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—The prominent conservative grassroots group FreedomWorks jumped into the House leadership race this week, throwing its support behind Rep. Jim Jordan to succeed retiring Speaker Paul Ryan. \nFreedomWorks, which says it has six million members, began encouraging its activists late Wednesday afternoon to tweet, call or email the Ohio Republican’s office and urge him to enter the contest.\nMr. Jordan, one of the founders of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of about three dozen of the House’s most conservative Republicans, said late last week he was considering running to succeed Mr. Ryan, after other conservatives asked him to challenge the two front-runners, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) and Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.).\n“This is not an inside-the-Beltway issue. This is an issue our activists are going to make an issue in the midterms,” said Noah Wall, the group’s vice president of advocacy. Heading into the November election, “we have an enthusiasm gap that is undeniable versus the Democrats,” Mr. Wall said. He said the prospect of electing Mr. Jordan speaker could inject conservative energy into a midterm landscape in which the party is likely to face headwinds.\nRead More \nA Leader of GOP’s Freedom Caucus Weighs Run for House Speaker House Speaker Paul Ryan Endorses Kevin McCarthy to Succeed Him Some Republicans See House Speaker Race as an Open Field Mr. Jordan said this week that he hadn’t made any decision about entering the race, with House Republicans not expected to choose their leader until after the midterm elections. Mr. Ryan has said he plans to remain speaker until January and has endorsed Mr. McCarthy to succeed him.\n“I don’t see any indication Paul is going to leave,” Mr. Jordan said Tuesday evening. “We have a speaker, and if and when there’s a race, I’ll look at it then.”\nThe winner of the House Republicans’ vote as next leader will be either the GOP’s conference’s choice for speaker, should Republicans retain their majority, or the minority leader if Democrats take control. The speaker is elected by the entire House in January after the new Congress is sworn in.\nMany House Republicans believe Mr. Jordan would have a difficult time securing the vote of 218 lawmakers to get elected speaker. The Freedom Caucus often works as a bloc to try to extract promises from House GOP leaders, a tactic that sometimes frustrates centrist Republicans. Some lawmakers say Mr. Jordan might enter the leadership race in order to negotiate with other candidates to win more prominent committee seats or other prizes for the Freedom Caucus.\nMr. Jordan, a two-time collegiate wrestling champion, co-founded the caucus in January 2015. Mr. Wall noted that conservative grass-roots pressure helped push former Speaker John Boehner out of office later that year, when it started to become difficult for House Republicans to publicly support him.\n“No one believed John Boehner was vulnerable until he was,” Mr. Wall said.\nFreedomWorks polled its advisory council, a group of about 20 national leaders of conservative groups, on Tuesday evening. The group unanimously backed Mr. Jordan, Mr. Wall said, and FreedomWorks now plans to encourage other members of the Freedom Caucus to publicly endorse the Ohio lawmaker.\nWrite to Kristina Peterson at kristina.peterson@wsj.com",
