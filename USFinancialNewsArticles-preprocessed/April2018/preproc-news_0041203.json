    "text": "0 COMMENTS After President Donald Trump announced last week that the U.S., along with the U.K. and France, had launched airstrikes in Syria to punish President Bashar al-Assad for a suspected chemical attack against civilians, some pundits questioned the timing of the decision. Was this a “wag the dog” situation, an attempt to distract from Mr. Trump’s various brewing scandals?\nOn her MSNBC show, Rachel Maddow said , “Even if the tail is not wagging the dog...what else is going on in the president’s life right now unavoidably creates a real perception around the globe that that may have been part of the motivation.” In response, David Gergen said on CNN’s “Reliable Sources,” “It may have been twisting the tail, but it was not a ‘wag the dog’ kind of event.”\nThe allusion in this canine talk is to the 1997 movie “Wag the Dog,” in which a spin doctor, played by Robert De Niro, decides that the best way to deflect attention from a presidential sex scandal is to create a fictional war with Albania. The film’s epigraph illuminates the title: “Why does a dog wag its tail? Because a dog is smarter than its tail. If the tail was smarter, the tail would wag the dog.”\nThe idiom of “the tail wagging the dog,” used for when a minor element comes to dominate a situation, or when the offshoot of an entity comes to overpower the entity itself, has a history in American English going back to Civil War days. \nThe seeds for the expression go back to the comic hit “Our American Cousin” by the English playwright Tom Taylor, which premiered in 1858. Its most notorious performance came seven years later, when Abraham Lincoln was assassinated while attending the play in Washington at Ford’s Theatre.\nOne popular character in the play was a dimwitted English nobleman, Lord Dundreary, who was terrible at telling jokes. Such mangled witticisms came to be known as “Dundrearyisms.” In one copy of the script, Dundreary tells a riddle: “Why does a dog waggle his tail? Because the tail can’t waggle the dog!” In 1862, the magazine London Society elaborated the joke in a way similar to the epigraph for the 1997 film but told in Dundreary’s signature lisp: “If he wathn’t the tail would waggle the dog!” \nMore in Word on the Street \nAn FBI Raid Puts the Spotlight on ‘Fixer’ April 13, 2018 The Journey of ‘Caravan’ From Ancient Camels to Immigrant Tensions April 6, 2018 Three Centuries of ‘Hush Money,’ From Jonathan Swift to Stormy Daniels March 30, 2018 The Equine and Political Meanings of ‘Feeling One’s Oats’ March 23, 2018 The Many Faces of ‘Blindsided,’ From Middle English to Donald Trump March 16, 2018 That improbable image quickly became popular in both England and the U.S., and it entered political arguments surrounding the Civil War. An Ohio newspaper in February 1864 criticized secessionists arguing for states’ rights by saying that they “want a tail constructed with a dog attached to it—a government in which the tail shall be strong enough to ‘waggle the head.’ ”\nThe version with “wag” soon eclipsed “waggle,” as in an 1869 article in Britain’s Manchester Guardian about Prussia annexing North German territories: “In North Germany, at this moment, the tail has certainly begun to wag the dog; that is to say, the annexed and federated states are controlling and coercing the annexing power.” \nSince then, “the tail wagging the dog” has become convenient shorthand for such reversals of power. But thanks to the movie “Wag the Dog,” we most often hear the expression when a presidential policy decision seems to be driven by publicity concerns.",
