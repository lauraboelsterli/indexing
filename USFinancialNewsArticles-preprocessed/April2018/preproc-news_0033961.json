    "text": "CHICAGO, and SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., April 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Quantum Energy Inc. (OTC Pink:QEGY) (“Quantum”) and Inductance Energy Corporation, a Wyoming corporation (“IEC”) a privately held company, today announced that they have entered into a binding letter of intent, pursuant to which upon satisfaction of certain conditions, IE Arizona, Inc., an IEC affiliated company (“IE Arizona”) a Wyoming corporation, a privately held company, would be merged with Quantum. The proposed merger is conditioned upon, among other things, IEC’s successful completion of its due diligence examination of Quantum, the negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement and IEC raising in the aggregate up to $50,000,000 (the “ Total Capital Investment ”). Provided such conditions are satisfied including IEC’s funding of the Total Capital Investment, Quantum will issue to IEC such number of shares of Quantum common stock as shall represent 60% of the then issued and outstanding shares of Quantum common stock. Quantum will also, based on valuations as yet to be determined, issue additional shares (after the initial issuance to IEC), to additional investors, as necessary to accommodate the closing of the Total Capital Investment. The combined entity will also provide the necessary funds required to prove out the viability of the development of the refinery (the “ Refinery ”) currently planned to be developed in Stoughton Saskatchewan, Canada including (a) obtaining environmental and engineering studies to prove the viability of the intended site, (b) if the site is determined to be viable, to acquire the land, (c) obtain required permits and (d) pay other related costs.\nThe transaction is expected to be completed on or before December 31, 2018.\nAlso, upon completion of the merger, William J. Hinz, who is currently a member of the Board of Directors of Quantum and a member of the Board of Directors and CEO of IEC, will become interim Chief Operating Officer of Quantum.
