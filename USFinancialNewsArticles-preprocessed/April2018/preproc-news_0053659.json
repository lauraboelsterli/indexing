We achieved strong or good growth in all divisions. Global Technologies and Entrance Systems reported strong organic growth of 6% and 5% respectively. EMEA and Americas reported 3% organic growth and Asia Pacific reported 4%. Our new products contributed strongly, with high demand for electromechanical locks and for access control solutions.\nThe first quarter's operating income increased by 2% year-on-year and amounted to SEK 2,829 M, corresponding to an operating margin of 15.3%. The Group's underlying margin improved but was diluted by the acquisitions.\nOperating cash flow was seasonally low totaling SEK 575 M for the quarter. We are continuing to focus on cost-efficiency and to deliver on our current restructuring program and, as previously communicated, we expect to announce a new program by the end of 2018.\nFirst impressions\nI spent my first months at ASSA ABLOY on the move, visiting the different Group locations to meet our people, our partners and our customers as well as to get acquainted with the sites, the corporate culture and the business. So far, I have visited 18 of our main locations and I am impressed by the competence, the innovation capacity and the technology driven culture. There have been several changes in ASSA ABLOYs executive team over the last 12 months. I am convinced that we have a strong team in place, equipped with energy and ambition to continue the Group's successful journey. I am both eager and humble in taking on the mission to further develop ASSA ABLOY.\nStrong market position\nAs the new CEO, it is very encouraging to see our strong market position. Product and innovation leadership, backed by the largest installed base of door opening solutions in the world, gives us a very strong platform to grow from. I am confident that we will create new business opportunities through our new products and solutions, and that we have seen only the initial phase of the market transition and technology shift from mechanical solutions to digital, connected products and services.\nStrategic direction\nASSA ABLOY's strategy, with focus on market presence, product leadership and cost efficiency, has been very successful for many years. In combination with a strong acquisition agenda, this strategy has generated significant long-term value. I look forward to further developing this successful strategy together with my colleagues.\nNico Delvaux\nPresident and CEO\nFurther information can be obtained from:\nNico Delvaux,\nPresident and CEO,\nTel: +46 8 506 485 82\nCarolina Dybeck Happe,\nChief Financial Officer,\nTel: +46 8 506 485 72\nASSA ABLOY is holding an analysts' meeting at 10.00 today at Operaterrassen in Stockholm, Sweden.\nThe analysts' meeting can also be followed on the Internet at www.assaabloy.com .\nIt is possible to submit questions by telephone on: +46-8-5055-6476, +44-203-364-5371 or +1-877 679-2993\nThis information is information that ASSA ABLOY AB is obliged to make public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation.
