U.S.   walks as he returns to the White House after a trip to Lewisburg, West Virginia, in Washington D.C.,   REUTERS/Carlos Barria \nNo formal negotiating sessions have been set, the official said. “There is ongoing communications with the Chinese on trade,” said the official, who requested anonymity to discuss the Trump administration’s trade strategy. \nThe official said Republican  , who has already sought $50 billion (35.7 billion pounds) in new tariffs on China, will insist on “verifiable, enforceable and measurable deliverables” from China in any trade negotiations.
