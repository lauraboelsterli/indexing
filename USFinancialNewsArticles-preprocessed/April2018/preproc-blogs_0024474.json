Subscribe to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity for in-depth coverage on cybersecurity trends, breaches and best practices. Good morning, CIOs. People across the world have spoken and made it clear, they do not want to share their personal data. (For more on this, see below for the Download’s overview of Facebook Inc .’s visit to Washington, D.C.) The assumption seems to be that the public is battling tech companies for control of a vital resource, insofar as data is the putative oil of the 21st century. What if, however, that formulation isn’t quite right? What if data is more akin to gas… the sort that inflates hot air balloons?\nLet’s consider the idea of the social graph, an assemblage of everything that the users of a digital platform view or do, every like, every share, every thumbs up, every endorsement, every page view, every purchase and even the amount of time that their cursor or finger lingers over an object on a page. Soon digital cameras and microphones will record our vocal inflections and subtle facial expressions. All of this data feeds into algorithms and analytic engines that are supposed to anticipate what we want to buy with a precision that today’s marketers can’t even imagine. Personalized wellness plans and medical treatments will extend our lives, and our time on this earth as productive assets. That’s what people mean when they talk about digital business.\nOf course there is bound to be a lot of value here. Companies are already building successful businesses on this model and there is reason to believe that more will be created. The danger is that companies will be distracted by this exhaust pipe of daily life. While they are sifting through the endless, mundane detritus of digital activity to figure out what people want, the next Steve Jobs or Henry Ford or Thomas Edison will be imagining it.\nTECHNOLOGY NEWS \nDuring his testimony Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg addressed the company’s recent data-breach scandals ANDREW HARRER/BLOOMBERG NEWS In Facebook hearings, lawmakers ramp up talk of regulation. Facebook Inc. CEO Mark Zuckerberg spent two days on Capitol Hill seeking to placate angry lawmakers by saying he would be open to some sort of regulation to protect the privacy of users on his global social-media platform. The WSJ’s John D. McKinnon and Deepa Seetharman report that when discussion turned to details about how industrywide rules might help protect user data, Mr. Zuckerberg often couched his willingness to embrace new rules with warnings about poor regulation leading to unintended consequences.\nTakeaway . “Ultimately Mr. Zuckerberg offered to change little about how Facebook makes money—by selling ad slots and offering targeted ad products,” says the WSJ.\nTakeaway 2 . Notes the New York Times : “If the byword of platforms like Facebook is ‘stickiness,’ Mr. Zuckerberg’s prepared, bland affect achieved the opposite. He was so unsticky, the questions slid right off him.”\nYet, Facebook’s days as an unregulated monopoly may be numbered. If regulators want to change Facebook’s calculus, they will have to either enact tougher regulation or nurture more competition, says the Journal’s Greg Ip .\nLosers: People wanting answers. One Senate staffer tells the WSJ that with a few exceptions, “members were clearly not well-informed about past Facebook privacy abuses, or even on Facebook’s core business model” after Tuesday’s hearing. Wired has a list of everything that Mr. Zuckerberg promised he would follow up on.\nWinners: Investors. Shares in the company rose 5.5% over the two days of testimony.\nBig oil’s favorite toy: Supercomputers. Like high-cost deepwater oil projects, in-house supercomputing remains largely the domain of only the world’s biggest oil companies, the WSJ’s Sarah Kent and Christopher M. Matthews report . BP Plc. is in the middle of a five-year, $100 million investment in its Houston supercomputer which has the computing power of around 50,000 iPhone 7s.\nSmaller players find a way. Devon Energy Corp. is putting its data in Microsoft Corp. ‘s cloud. “It costs me hundreds of thousands of dollars versus tens of millions,” said Benjamin Williams, Devon’s chief information officer.\nYou think discovering a computer virus is hard? Security experts who first identify computer bugs, viruses, worms, ransomware and other coding catastrophes often get to name their finds. But with such discoveries now numbering in the thousands each year, crafting a standout moniker can be a serious challenge, the WSJ’s Robert McMillan reports .\nUber expands transport options. The company announced Wednesday that it is partnering with Getaround, a service that lets car owners rent their vehicles online, and Masabi, which provides mobile-based ticketing for public transport, the FT reports .\nTesla blames driver in fatal crash. Tesla Inc . defended its semiautonomous Autopilot system in the wake of a fatal crash last month, blaming the incident on the driver after his family hired a lawyer to explore legal options, the WSJ’s Tim Higgins and Mike Spector report . “The crash happened on a clear day with several hundred feet of visibility ahead,” the automaker said, adding the accident could only have occurred if the driver wasn’t paying attention.\nFacebook linked to illegal ivory trade. Wildlife traffickers are using the Facebook platform, including Instagram and Whatsapp, to engage in the illegal trade of body parts of threatened animals, the Associated Press reports . Meanwhile the social network is displaying ads for “well-known corporations” on the traffickers’ Facebook group pages.\nSo a New York Times reporter downloaded his Facebook data. “With a few clicks, I learned that about 500 advertisers — many that I had never heard of, like Bad Dad, a motorcycle parts store, and Space Jesus, an electronica band — had my contact information, which could include my email address, phone number and full name.” Read more .\nNew target for China’s censors: Content driven by AI. In China, concerns over a smartphone app trafficking in off-color jokes led to authorities shutting it down—and an abject apology from the site’s operator, the WSJ’s Josh Chin reports . “This entire time we’ve been overemphasizing the value of technology without realizing that technology must be guided by socialist core values,” Zhang Yiming, founder of the app maker, Beijing Bytedance Technology Co., said in a statement.\nEnvironmentalists in space. Bloomberg reports that the Environmental Defense Fund is planning to build and launch a satellite designed to measure methane, a greenhouse gas\nCambridge Analytica CEO post goes to Julian Wheatland. Cambridge Analytica’s acting CEO Alex Tayler told the company’s leadership that Mr. Wheatland, the chairman of its British affiliate, would take over as the company’s next chief executive.

Apple Inc. named Oliver Schusser, the head of its European music and content operations, to lead Apple Music world-wide, the WSJ’s Tripp Mickle reports .\nEVERYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW \nA series of exchanges between Trump and Moscow raised the prospect of a direct clash between U.S. and Russian military forces in Syria. (WSJ)\nJames Comey’s memoir hits bookstores April 17, with the former FBI director planning a series of media appearances that will put him back in the public eye . (WSJ)\nGlobal stocks steadied and oil prices remained near three-year highs, as investors continue to grapple with escalating geopolitical tensions and market volatility. (WSJ)\nGeneral Electric is exploring a public offering for one of its divisions and discussing hybrid deals with public companies to combine assets.
