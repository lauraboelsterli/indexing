    "text": "Other changes before the board include a public stock market listing of VW’s truck and bus division, a management board seat for a labor representative and a reorganization of its 12 brands into four categories, sources said. Slideshow (2 Images) \nVolkswagen’s efforts to reform have often been stifled by powerful labor unions who command half of the seats on the board of directors, and the German state of Lower Saxony, which controls a 20 percent voting stake. \nVolkswagen shares were up 2.5 percent ahead of the board meeting due to start at 1400 GMT on Thursday at the carmaker's Wolfsburg base, and were one of the top gainers on the German blue-chip DAX .GDAXI . \n“Nobody knew anything,” a source at one of VW’s brands told Reuters. “What’s going on there is plain folly.” \n“The way in which changes of such a magnitude were communicated internally is more than questionable,” a source close to VW’s supervisory board said. \nSources close to VW said the controlling Porsche-Piech families and Lower Saxony had decided they could not afford to wait because of the risk of the changes being leaked. \nThey had brought Thursday’s board meeting forward from Friday afternoon for the same reason, the sources said. \nGerman business daily Handelsblatt reported that Finance Chief Frank Witter was enraged about how the supervisory board had piloted the changes and that there was a risk that he could step down, citing unnamed sources at VW. \nWitter did not want to comment, a VW spokesman said, while the carmaker’s headquarters and works council declined comment. \nThe management reshuffle could affect other senior VW executives, a source told Reuters on Wednesday.
