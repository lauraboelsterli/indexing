    "text": "0 COMMENTS Oil prices wavered between gains and losses Friday after an escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China pressured markets.\nU.S. crude futures recent traded down 28 cents, or 0.44%, at $63.26 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent, the global benchmark, fell 9 cents, or 0.13%, to $68.24 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe.\nU.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened to impose tariffs on an additional $100 billion of imports from China, raising concerns about a potential trade war.\nFor now, crude hasn’t been included in China’s retaliatory tariffs, but investors are wary of the risk. China is the second largest importer of U.S. oil.\n“The indirect impact is going to be more about a slowdown in global trade and GDP, the feed through into global demand growth,” said Richard Mallinson, analyst at consultancy Energy Aspects.\nThus far, the energy products included in China’s tariffs are propane and polyethylene. Since the U.S. resumed oil exports in 2016, the shale oil-and-gas boom has helped the country to offset a gaping trade deficit with China.\nOil prices have been swayed by concerns about trade tensions for much of the week as investors tried to gauge the likely outcome.\n“This is just noise,” said Ric Navy, senior vice president of energy futures at R.J. O’Brien & Associates. “I think people are kind of in wait and see mode.”\nU.S. trade statistics for February, published Thursday, showed the total trade deficit growing to the largest it has been since 2009 and the largest ever if petroleum is excluded, consultancy JBC Energy said in a note.\n“It is obvious that this standoff between the U.S. and China is quite serious and navigating these waters will be tricky for traders as any meaningful change to the perception regarding future trade issues will most likely trump the potential effects of short-term variations to oil fundamentals,” the note said.\nOther geopolitical issues, which are instead bullish for oil prices, include rising tensions in the Middle East between major oil producers Iran and Saudi Arabia, along with expectations the U.S. may withdraw from the international nuclear deal with Iran and reinstate sanctions.\n“The impact on oil flows if China was to hit U.S. crude oil exports would be about the same as the expected impact on oil flows if the U.S. was to hit the Iranian nuclear deal,” said Olivier Jakob, head of energy consultancy Petromatrix.\nGasoline futures recently fell 0.27% to $1.9762 a gallon. Diesel futures rose 0.25% to $1.9815 a gallon.\nWrite to Sarah McFarlane at sarah.mcfarlane@wsj.com and Alison Sider at alison.sider@wsj.com",
