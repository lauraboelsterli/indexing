    "text": "Shares of Spotify opened nearly 4 percent up Thursday after an analyst at Stifel called the music streaming service one of the best-value deals on the internet behind Amazon and Netflix . \n\"We believe an all-you-can-listen-to on-demand music streaming service for $9.99 a month is high on the list of Internet services offered on a value per dollar basis, right behind's Amazon's $99 a year all-you-can-order (and more) Prime membership and Netflix's $10.99 a month all you-can-watch subscription,\" analyst John Egbert said in a note. \nStifel issued a buy rating on the stock and a target price of $180, a 25 percent upside from where the stock closed Wednesday. \nThe company, which counted 160 million monthly active listeners and 70 million paying subscribers as of December, has yet to see a profit.\nEgbert is forecasting the company will double both its user base and paying subscribers, and see a profit by 2021. \n\"We think Spotify's market leadership, emerging markets exposure, favorable user demographics, the secular shift to mobile and digital services, as well as the near-universal appreciation of music, will support Spotify's growth for years to come,\" he said. \nSpotify has had a mixed first few days on the public markets. Shares rose as much as 28 percent Tuesday in its NYSE debut, before closing 13 percent up . Wednesday the stock returned some of its gains , falling as much as 8.5 percent before closing 3 percent down.",
