    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s decision to conduct air strikes against Syria was in the country’s national interest, and not the result of pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Theresa May told parliament on Monday.\n“We have not done this because President Trump asked us to, we have done it because we believed it was the right thing to do, and we are not alone. There is broad-based international support for the action we have taken,” May said.\nReporting by Elizabeth Piper, writing by William James, editing by David Milliken\n ",
