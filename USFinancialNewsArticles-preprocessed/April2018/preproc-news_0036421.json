    "text": "April 17, 2018 / 5:01 AM / Updated 7 minutes ago Thai telco True says personal data of 11,400 customers made public by unit Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai mobile phone operator True Corp said on Tuesday personal identification data of 11,400 of its customers has been made public by its unit iTruemart, in possibly the first known instance of a major data leak at a mobile operator in Thailand. People walk past the logo of True Corp in Bangkok, Thailand, February 29, 2016. REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha \nThe files made public belonged to customers buying “TrueMove H” mobile packages via True’s e-commerce platform iTruemart, Pakpong Pattanamas, a deputy director for True Corp’s mobile business, told reporters at a news conference held at the telecoms regulator’s office. \nNo data of other TrueMove H customers was affected, he added. \nTrue Corp is Thailand’s second biggest mobile operator and the flagship company of billionaire Dhanin Chearavanont’s Charoen Pokphand Group.
