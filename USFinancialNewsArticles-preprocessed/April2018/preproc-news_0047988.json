    "text": "In an interview with CEOLive.TV, CEO Timothy Hassett explains how his technology can bring lifesaving power to any place where it’s possible\nORLANDO, FL, April 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CEOLive.TV , a news organization that highlights leading CEOs, companies, and industry experts for investors, today released a video interview with Timothy Hassett , Chairman and CEO of Cool Technologies, Inc . (OTCQB:WARM).\nThe full interview can be viewed at the following URL:\nhttp://ceolive.tv/cool-technologies-warm-1m-order-puts-innovative-cooltech-mobile-generator-into-production/\nAs Hassett explained to CEOLive.TV’s Mike Elliott, Cool Technologies’ innovative technology can bring lifesaving electricity to communities hit with natural disasters like hurricanes or fires, or with other types of blackouts. “Wherever you can drive a vehicle, you can bring power,” Hassett said.\nCool Technologies mounts generators right in the chassis of standard trucks like Ford F-350s and 550s, using the trucks’ own engines to turn their generators. Trucks with 80 and 120 kilovolt amp (kVA) capabilities could have made a major difference in Puerto Rico, both after Hurricane Maria destroyed the entire electrical grid, and again recently, when blackouts struck the whole island after contractors accidently brought down major transmission lines, Hassett said. “If they had our vehicles, they would have the power anywhere the lines were still standing and immediately after they were re-strung,” he said.\nWhat’s more, the generator-equipped trucks can power water purification equipment to provide drinking water—up to 10,000 gallons a day—in emergencies like those faced in Puerto Rico, Hassett said. There are three essential things when disaster strikes, he said: water, power, and food. “We can provide two out of the three,” he explained.\nHassett also recently lived through the terrible fires in Santa Rosa, California , where his trucks could have accelerated rescue and recovery efforts. “I was right in the heart of it,” he described. “My eleven-year-old daughter woke up at 12 in the morning, and we could see explosions up on the mountainside taking our homes and businesses.” More than 8,000 buildings were destroyed, and Hassett had to evacuate from his house three times. Firefighters and first responders told him that one of their major problems was not being able to bring power quickly to the devastated areas, since it was virtually impossible to haul standard tow-behind generators up the mountainsides. “But with our technology, you can drive right to where you need the power,” Hassett said. “You can run a welder, a jackhammer, or whatever you need to do.”\nHassett stressed that Cool Technologies is already in production of its generator-equipped trucks, with the first ten orders under construction and purchase commitments for hundreds more units. As a result, before the peak of the hurricane season arrives, “we can get the trucks to where they’re needed,” he said.\nAbout Cool Technologies, Inc.\nCool Technologies is an intellectual property and product development company commercializing patented thermal dispersion technology across multiple platforms. The Company has additional patents-pending for various OEM applications of its proprietary heat removal technologies for fans, bearings, clutches and wet or dry brakes. Tested and validated by third parties including ESSCO Pumps, Nidec Corporation, and Mohler Technology, the Company’s cooling system eliminates the need for costly modifications while increasing power output of pumps, compressors, batteries, motors and generators by up to 40% when compared to existing technologies.\nAbout CEOLIVE Media Group\nCEOLIVE Media Group offers extensive, in-depth coverage of U.S publicly traded companies and their management teams.
