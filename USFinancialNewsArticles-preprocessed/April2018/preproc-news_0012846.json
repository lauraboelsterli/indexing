It says its policies are to ensure Hungarians can live in safety.\nOrban, seeking a third consecutive term on Sunday, has campaigned on a strong anti-migration message - although a U.N. panel expert said the timing of the watchdog’s comments, at the end of a four-week meeting, was not directed at voters.\nThe U.N. Human Rights Committee voiced concern at “hate crimes and about hate speech in political discourse, the media and on the internet targeting minorities, notably, Roma, Muslim, migrants and refugees, including in the context of government-sponsored campaigns”.\nThe panel issued its findings and recommendations after its 18 independent experts reviewed Hungary’s record on upholding civil and political rights.\n“The concern we saw in Hungary is that sometimes hate speech is accompanied by hate crimes which are directed against minorities and against migrants,” Yuval Shany, the panel vice-chair, told Reuters TV.\nForeign Minister Peter Szijjarto defended Hungary’s policies, telling the U.N. panel last month: “First and foremost, it is a firm conviction of the government that the Hungarian people have the right to live a life in security, without fear of terrorist atrocities.”\nIn 2015, the central European country had a “sad experience” when some 400,000 migrants passed through on their way to Western Europe, “ignoring all rules”, he said.\nThe U.N. panel also decried a Hungarian law adopted a year ago that allows for automatically removing all asylum applicants to transit zones for indefinite confinement.\nPeople should be allowed freedom of movement while their individual asylum claims are examined to see whether they are refugees fleeing war or persecution, the committee said.\nThe panel added that Hungary should repeal a June 2016 law that enables police to summarily expel anyone entering irregularly.\nThe committee also voiced concern at the “prevalence of anti-Semitic stereotypes” and how “high-ranking officials have nurtured conspiracy theories relating to George Soros”.\nOrban has waged a billboard and media campaign asserting that Soros would “settle millions from Africa and the Middle East”, among other allegations.\nSoros, who is Jewish, has rejected the campaign against him as “distortions and lies” meant to create a false external enemy.
