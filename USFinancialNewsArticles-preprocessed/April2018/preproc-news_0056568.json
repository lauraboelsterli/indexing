    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning. The search is off. I have discovered the nerdiest, buzzwordiest ad campaign of the year, nay, decade. The Drum reports TD Ameritrade and Havas have placed an ad in the blockchain , using 68 lines of code, consisting of 60 cryptocurrency transactions, to create a piece of ASCII art. The aim of the campaign? Havas New York Chief Creative Officer Harry Bernstein says it was all about demystifying finance, cryptocurrency, and blockchain, plus: “Being the first is always an awesome thing for me. Kids love surprises, and I love surprises.”\nThere May Be Trouble Ahead After weeks of taking a very public bashing over its data-handling responsibilities, Facebook executives were probably glad to seize back control of the narrative on Wednesday. Advertisers seemed largely undeterred by the Cambridge Analytica scandal and that showed in the company’s first-quarter earnings: Revenue rose nearly 50% to $11.97 billion and net income jumped 63% to almost $5 billion in the three months to March 31. #DeleteFacebook doesn’t appear to have been a phenomenon either: Facebook added around 70 million monthly users, bringing the total to 2.2 billion. Still, next quarter might not be as rosy—the first Cambridge Analytica stories only landed toward the end of March, after all. Facebook also warned its European monthly active user and daily active user numbers might be flat to slightly down sequentially as GDPR is coming into force, although the company’s finance chief David Wehner said it doesn’t expect the new privacy law to significantly impact revenue. However, he did warn that if marketers aren’t able to target as effectively, they’d probably get less of a return on their advertising. That might bring ad prices down.\n—If I Could Turn Back Time—\nYou may remember Facebook has been tweaking its news feed over the past few months in an attempt to prioritize “meaningful interactions.” In announcing those changes, Facebook warned that the changes could lead to a drop in the time users spend on the platform. Ad-buyers said that could drive up ad prices. Last quarter, Facebook said the collective time users spent on the platform dropped by around 5%. This quarter? That’s anyone’s guess as Facebook didn’t provide an update. When asked by an analyst about the metric on the earnings call, Mr. Wehner said “we’re seeing a decrease in certain types of time spent, such as passive video consumption...and an increase in areas like sharing.” Here’s what we do know: The average price per ad increased 39% and the number of ad impressions served rose 8%.\nThe Fault in Our Stars Could the era of the handsomely-paid star network news anchor be over? That’s the suggestion in Joe Flint’s must-read WSJ piece, assessing NBC’s $69 million bet on Megyn Kelly . NBC had hoped the Fox News star would bring in a bigger audience for the “Today” franchise, but, so far, ratings have tanked. Beyond, Ms. Kelly’s turmoil during her first year, a lot has happened at news networks recently that might cause marketers to reassess the value of celebrity news anchors. There were the high-profile exits of NBC’s Matt Lauer and CBS’s Charlie Rose due to sexual-harassment allegations. Plus relative unknowns have been slotted into morning and evening news shows to replace big names, without damaging ratings. For her part, Ms. Kelly said in an interview that it’s too soon to make a full assessment of her “Today” performance, “I think any show needs about a year to just find its footing.”\nCan I Skip It? No You Can’t! If you build an option that lets people skip ads, you can bet your bottom dollar most users will get trigger-happy with that skip button. A survey of more than 3,000 Americans conducted by customer-acquisition firm Fluent last year found 69% of those polled said they skip ads on Snapchat “always” or “often.” So bring on the unskippable ads! Digiday’s Lucia Moses reports Snapchat is going to start testing six-second nonskippable ads within the TV-like shows it hosts in its Discover section. Six seconds might seem like a long time to wait through in other sections of the app, but shows are probably Snapchat’s best lean-back experience where users might relax their thumbs away from their phone screens. Aptly, the new format is called “commercials.” If nonskippable Snapchat ads sound familiar, that might be because you’re remembering an Ad Age report from January that suggested Snapchat was considering a YouTube-like format where users would have to watch three seconds of ads before skipping. No more news on that yet.\n— Erase and Rewind—\nSome users were aghast last year when Snapchat rolled out a redesign to separate snaps from people’s friends from content from advertisers, publishers and celebrities. Celebrities were enraged, petitions were signed and Snap’s share price dropped at the time. Snap has been listening. Late Tuesday the company confirmed it was testing a redesign of the redesign, placing stories from friends on the Discover page. Snap hasn’t said why, although Recode’s Kurt Wagner wonders whether people were watching and creating fewer stories within the redesigned app, or whether Snap is trying to boost consumption of publisher content. Whatever the reason, Wall Street didn’t seem impressed with the switcheroo. Snap shares closed down almost 7% on Wednesday.\nBest of the rest French prosecutors brought preliminary charges against tycoon Vincent Bolloré Tuesday for allegedly bribing politicians in Togo and Guinea to win lucrative contracts in the West African nations. “Mr. Bolloré , who is presumed innocent, can finally have access to investigative files that he has never seen and respond to these baseless accusations,” according to a statement released by his company, Bolloré SA. [ WSJ ]\nThe European Commission has proposed new EU-wide regulations that would require web search engines such as Google to provide more transparency about their search rankings. The commission also urged platforms to do more to halt the spread of disinformation or “fake news,” on their sites, or face possible regulation. [ WSJ ]\nFacebook launched a major U.S. ad campaign this week, explaining how the company plans to do more to keep users and their information safe. [ Business Insider ]\nBillionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel has agreed not to buy Gawker.com to avoid a potential lawsuit over his secretly funding the litigation that drove the website’s publisher out of business. [ WSJ ]\nCriteo’s co-founder and chairman Jean-Baptiste Rudelle is returning to the role of chief executive, effective immediately. Former Chief Executive Eric Eichmann is switching to an advisor role and will transition out of the board of directors. [ The Drum ]\nHearst Magazines is acquiring a minority stake in Gear Patrol, a digital and print publication focused on products and enthusiast communities, to help its e-commerce efforts. [ CMO Today ]\nDigg, the content-aggregation platform, has been acquired by ad-tech company BuySellAds. A spokesman for the ad-tech firm tells me Digg will operate as an independent company but that BuySellAds hopes to grow the business, using self-service advertising tools.
