FILE PHOTO - The ticker and logo for General Electric Co. is displayed on a screen at the post where it is traded on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S. on June 30, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo \nThe information technology business houses its financial management, ambulatory care and workforce management software assets, GE said in a statement. \nThe transaction is expected to close during the third quarter of 2018. \nGE said in February it had a “line of sight” on the first $4 billion in asset sales under its plans for $20 billion in disposals, as it tries to shore up its financial performance. \nAs part of the plan, the company is looking to sell its transportation unit, which makes railway locomotives and the iconic lighting division that makes bulbs for consumers. \nMorgan Stanley and Keval Health are GE’s financial advisers, while Goldman Sachs & Co. and William Blair & Co advised Veritas Capital. \nShares of the U.S. industrial conglomerate were down 2.6 percent at $13.14 in line with the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI which fell 2 percent on Monday.
