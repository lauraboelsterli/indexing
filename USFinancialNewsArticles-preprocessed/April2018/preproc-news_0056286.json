    "text": "Intel executives say they 'bit off a little too much' amid 10-nanometer chip delays Chloe Aiello Reblog Intel CEO Brian Krzanich dismissed investor concerns that functionality issues were causing 10-nanometer production delays. Despite a first quarter earnings beat that sent shares flying, Intel INTC executives faced an intense line of questioning on a call with investors following the report. Intel has teased the large-scale release of these 10-nanometer chips for years, promising they'd deliver better performance with lower power usage than chips built with the company's 14-nanometer technology, which have been shipping since 2014.",
