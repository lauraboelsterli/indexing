    "text": "Russian President Vladimir Putin warned on Sunday that further Western attacks on Syria would bring chaos to world affairs, as Washington prepared to increase pressure on Russia with new economic sanctions.\nIn a telephone conversation with his Iranian counterpart Hassan Rouhani, Putin and Rouhani agreed that the Western strikes had damaged the chances of achieving a political resolution in the seven-year Syria conflict, according to a Kremlin statement.\n\"Vladimir Putin, in particular, stressed that if such actions committed in violation of the U.N. Charter continue, then it will inevitably lead to chaos in international relations,\" the Kremlin statement said.\nYuri Kadobnov | POOL | Reuters Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks during a meeting with supporters at his campaign headquarters in Moscow, Russia March 18, 2018. Meanwhile, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" program that the United States would announce new economic sanctions on Monday aimed at companies \"that were dealing with equipment\" related to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's alleged chemical weapons use.\nOn Saturday, the United States, France and Britain launched 105 missiles targeting what the Pentagon said were three chemical weapons facilities in Syria in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack in Douma on April 7.\nThe Western countries blame Assad for the Douma attack that killed dozens of people. The Syrian government and its ally Russia have denied involvement in any such attack.\nThe bombings marked the biggest intervention by Western countries against Assad and ally Russia.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday that he had convinced Trump, who has previously said he wanted to take U.S. forces out of Syria, to stay for \"the long term.\"\nThe United States, France and Britain have said the missile strikes were limited to Syria's chemical weapons capabilities and not aimed at toppling Assad or intervening in the civil war. Macron said in an interview broadcast by BFM TV, RMC radio and Mediapart online news that he had convinced Trump to focus on the chemical weapons sites.\n'More damage to the USA and Europe' Responding to Haley's remarks about the plans for new sanctions, Evgeny Serebrennikov, deputy head of the defense committee of Russia's upper house of parliament, said Moscow was ready for the penalties, according to RIA news agency.\n\"They are hard for us, but will do more damage to the USA and Europe,\" RIA Quote: : d Serebrennikov as saying.\nIn Damascus, Syria's deputy foreign minister, Faisal Mekdad, met inspectors from the global chemical weapons watchdog OPCW for about three hours in the presence of Russian officers and a senior Syrian security official.\nThe inspectors were due to attempt to visit the Douma site. Moscow condemned the Western states for refusing to wait for the OPCW's findings before attacking.\nMekdad declined to comment to reporters waiting outside the hotel where the meeting took place.\nAssad told a group of visiting Russian lawmakers that the Western missile strikes were an act of aggression, Russian news agencies reported.\nRussian agencies Quote: : d the lawmakers as saying that Assad was in a \"good mood\", had praised the Soviet-era air defense systems Syria used to repel the Western attacks and had accepted an invitation to visit Russia at an unspecified time.\nTrump had said \"mission accomplished\" on Twitter after the strikes, though U.S. Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie at the Pentagon acknowledged elements of the program remain and he could not guarantee that Syria would be unable to conduct a chemical attack in the future.\nRussian and Iranian military help over the past three years has allowed Assad to crush the rebel threat to topple him.\nThough Israel has at times urged stronger U.S. involvement against Assad and his Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah reinforcements in Syria, it voiced backing for Saturday's air strikes by Western powers.\n'Wider confrontation risk'\nThe leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah said on Sunday that Western strikes on Syria had failed to achieve anything, including terrorizing the army, helping insurgents or serving the interests of Israel.\nSayyed Hassan Nasrallah said the U.S. military had kept its strikes limited because it knew a wider attack would spark retaliation from Damascus and its allies and inflame the region.\n",
