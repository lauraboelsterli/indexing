    "text": "BARDONIA, N.Y., April 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Greater Hudson Bank (the “Bank”) (OTCQX:GHDS), with assets of $501.3 million, today reported net income of $205,000 or $0.02 per common share for 2018 compared to $664,000 or $0.05 per common share for the 2017 first quarter. Return on average common stockholders’ equity was 1.43 percent for the three compared to 5.82 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2017, respectively.\nEdward T. Lutz, President and CEO stated, “Earnings in 2018 were adversely affected by a number of one-time charges including a decision to write off a long standing problem asset related to the Bank’s REO property, an adjustment to the Bank’s carrying value of the REO property, one time personnel costs associated with staff reorganization and certain non-recurring legal fees. Absent those costs, net income would have exceeded our internal forecast for the quarter. It is important to note that assets, deposits and loans have resumed a growth trajectory that is in line with our forecasts, as we indicated in the year end 2017 release. It is also important to note that our spread and margins, the life blood of our institution, have widened compared to last year’s results. Positively, non-performing assets declined by about 6 percent in the first quarter and we are actively working to effect additional reductions in the coming quarters. Our balance sheet remains strongly capitalized. We look forward to continued expansion in the loan portfolio as our pipeline continues to be robust and we see growth in core deposits, as our team based approach to our core markets continues to be effective.”\nFinancial highlights as of March 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 are as follows:\nDeposits increased $20.0 million, or 5.2 percent, to $401.7 million. Total assets increased $18.5 million, or 3.8 percent, to $501.3 million. Loans, net of unearned income, increased $18.1 million or 5.6 percent, to $340.7 million. Investments increased $10.3 million, or 8.5 percent, to $131.3 million.\nPerformance highlights for the three compared to the March 31, 2017 period are as follows:\nNet interest income decreased $41,000, or 1.0 percent, to $4.2 million. Non-interest income increased $36,000 or 12.7 percent to $319,000. Non-interest expense increased $583,000 or 19.0 percent to $3.7 million. The provision for loan losses increased $132,000.\nKenneth J. Torsoe, Chairman of the Board commented, “Our quarterly results are effected by a number of one-time charges, and don’t fully reflect the trend of our performance. The underlying components of the Bank’s performance continue to improve and should show positive results in the future. Management’s plans are being executed in an effective and efficient fashion with a keen eye on developing sound and long lasting customer relationships. We continue to be a soundly operated community bank dedicated to fulfilling our mission to serve the banking needs of commercial clients, non-profits, and municipalities in our core communities.”\nEARNINGS\n*Results Unaudited Three months Ended March 31,\n(in thousands, except ratios) SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS DATA: 2018 2017 Net interest income $ 4,165 $ 4,206 Provision for loan losses 592 461 Noninterest income 319 283 Noninterest Expense 3,652 3,069 Income before income taxes 240 959 Provision for income taxes 35 295 Net income $ 205 $ 664 Efficiency Ratio 81.4% 68.4% AVERAGE BALANCE SHEET DATA: 2017 2016 Earning Assets $ 464,109 $ 485,458 Total Interest Bearing Liabilities 359,698 380,061 Net interest spread 3.52% 3.40% Net interest margin 3.59% 3.47% The decrease in net income for the three compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, is primarily attributable to an increase in non-interest expense of $583,000 and an increase of $132,000 to the provision for losses. The increase in non-interest expense is primarily related to one-time charges to salary and commission expenses and legal expenses incurred in the first quarter as part of a management review and reorganization, as well as a write-down of the Bank’s OREO property and an increase to the provision for loan losses as of March 31, 2018.\nBALANCE SHEET & CREDIT QUALITY\nSELECTED BALANCE SHEET DATA – Unaudited: As of (in thousands, except ratios) March 31, December 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 Total Investments $ 131,250 $ 120,990 $ 144,145 Loans, net of unearned income 340,702 322,633 328,024 Allowance for loan losses 4,128 3,873 5,020 Total assets 501,339 482,867 502,439 Total deposits 401,731 381,764 401,843 Borrowings 39,187 39,276 41,537 Nonperforming assets 7,746 8,261 13,569 Allowance for loan losses to total net loans 1.21% 1.20% 1.53% Nonperforming assets to total assets 1.55% 1.71% 2.70% The Bank’s total loans, net of unearned income increased by $18.1 million to $340.7 million as of March 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017.
