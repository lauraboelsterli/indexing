    "text": "Smart Investing Here's how to maximize those retirement 'sweet spot' years When full-time work is behind you and distributions from your retirement accounts are ahead of you, there's a good chance you are in a lower tax bracket. Converting your traditional IRA or 401(k) to a Roth IRA can make sense if you have the cash to pay the taxes due on the conversion. It also can be an ideal time to unload assets with long-term gains. Published 2 Hours Ago Updated 1 Hour Ago \nAs you head into retirement, there's a chance you also are entering a special time to do some serious tax planning. \nThis sweet spot is the stretch of time between when you retire from full-time work and when you have to start taking required minimum distributions from your 401(k) plan or your traditional individual retirement account at age 70½. \nPresumably, given that full-time work is behind you and those mandated distributions are ahead of you, it's also when you find yourself in a lower tax bracket. Photo by Ariel Skelley via Getty Images \n\"This is a good time to look at whether some strategies can work that help with taxes,\" said Avani Ramnani, director of financial planning and wealth management at Francis Financial. \nWhile there are ways to take advantage of lower tax rates, it's important to make sure any moves you make are in line with your broader retirement goals. \n\"Minimizing taxes should not dictate all financial decisions,\" Ramnani said. \"Ultimately, it is about using the best approach to be able to achieve [your] most important life goals.\" \nHere are some ways you might be able to capitalize on your lower tax bracket. Go Roth \nIt could make sense to convert a traditional IRA or a 401(k) plan account to a Roth IRA. \nWhile you must pay income taxes on the amount converted, it would be at your temporarily lower rate. \nIn comparison, if you were to leave those assets in a traditional IRA or 401(k) plan and not touch them until you begin taking required minimum distributions, those withdrawals could push you into a higher tax bracket. As such, a higher tax rate would apply to the assets. \nIn contrast, withdrawals from Roth IRAs are generally tax-free. There also are no required minimum distributions that come with them. In fact, some people simply let the balances accumulate over their lifetime and pass the Roth IRA on to heirs (who also enjoy the tax-free status, although they must meet other rules). show chapters ",
