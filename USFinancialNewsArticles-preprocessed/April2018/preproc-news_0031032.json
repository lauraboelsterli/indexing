    "text": "April 16, 2018 / 3:54 PM / Updated 18 minutes ago EPA chief Pruitt's $43,000 soundproof booth violated law: U.S. GAO Timothy Gardner 3 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency violated the law when it approved a $43,000 soundproof phone booth last year for the office of embattled Administrator Scott Pruitt, a congressional watchdog unit said on Monday.

REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein/Files \nThe Government Accountability Office said the EPA violated the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act, which prohibits an agency from obligating more than $5,000 in federal funds to furnish, redecorate or make improvements in the office of a presidential appointee without first notifying appropriations committees in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. \nThe EPA also violated the Antideficiency Act, which prohibits federal agencies from incurring expenses in excess of funds available in appropriations, the GAO said. \nLiz Bowman, an EPA spokeswoman, said the agency was “addressing GAO’s concern, with regard to Congressional notification about this expense, and will be sending Congress the necessary information this week.” \nThe privacy booth, which Pruitt had told lawmakers in a hearing was needed to conduct agency business, was built in a spot of a former storage closet in administrator’s office. \nThe GAO had been asked to investigate the matter by Democratic lawmakers including U.S. Senators Tom Carper and Tom Udall. Related Coverage EPA must explain why Pruitt's $43,000 phone booth was legal: Republican senator \nSenator John Barrasso, a Republican and the head of the Senate environment committee, earlier this month had rejected a request by Carper and others for a hearing looking into allegations that Pruitt had spent wastefully. \nBut on Monday Barrasso said in a statement after the GAO’s decision that Pruitt’s agency must give a “full public accounting” on the spending on the booth and explain why the agency thinks it was complying with the law. \nPruitt has been under fire from Republican and Democratic lawmakers for expensive travel and other expenses. Last week, Democratic lawmakers asked him to provide documents about ethics issues they said were revealed to them by a former agency official, including spending on bulletproof vests, guns and a contract with an Italian security service. \nAlso last week, fellow Republican Trey Gowdy, head of the oversight committee of the U.S. House of Representatives, asked Pruitt for more documents for his probe into the administrator’s first class air travel and leasing of a room in a Washington, D.C. condo for $50 for nights he was there. \nPresident Donald Trump has said he supports Pruitt, who has carried out his policy goals of slashing regulations on the oil, natural gas and coal industries, but will look into allegations about ethics lapses. \nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
