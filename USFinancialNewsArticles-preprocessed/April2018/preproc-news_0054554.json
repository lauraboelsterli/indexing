    "text": "1 COMMENTS Martin Whitman had no time for the modern practice of buying a vast range of stocks and hoping to match or maybe even slightly exceed the performance of the market. He stuck with so-called vulture investing: feasting on the securities of troubled companies others had written off as hopeless.\nIt sounded like a high-risk strategy. Mr. Whitman, the founder of Third Avenue Management LLC, called it conservative. He scoured the fine print of corporate disclosures and aimed to pay far below estimated net asset value for a stake in a firm with a solid balance sheet and recovery prospects.\n“We have sort of a three-to-five-year view, and we know we can’t pick bottoms,” he told The Wall Street Journal in 2001. “You buy when it’s good enough; you don’t time the bottom and don’t worry about the market.”\nHe was patient. “The near-term outlook is terrible on everything we do,” he once said.\nHe taught management at Yale University and Syracuse University, whose school of management is named after him.\nRead more\nRichard Jenrette Took an Unconventional Path to Riches on Wall Street April 27, 2018 FMC CEO Malott Thwarted Raiders by Loading Up Company With Debt April 27, 2018 Avicii, Electronic Dance DJ and Producer, Dies at 28 April 20, 2018 SEC Lawyer Scott Friestad, Bedridden With Cancer, Kept Working Until His Final Days April 20, 2018 Mr. Whitman played tennis into his 90s and was irked on the last day of his life when a doctor told him not to go to work. He died April 16 at home in Manhattan. He was 93.\nIn March 2012, at age 87, he stepped down as manager of the $3.4 billion Third Avenue Value Fund after more than 20 years, though he remained chairman of the company. During that period, the fund had an annualized return of 11.9% a year, putting it in the top fifth of all equity funds at least that old, according to Morningstar Inc.\nIn the past decade, though, the firm has struggled amid managerial discord. In late 2015, it shocked investors by barring withdrawals from its Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund pending a liquidation of the fund’s junk-bond portfolio. Third Avenue’s funds under management have fallen to about $4 billion from a peak of $26 billion in 2006.\nMartin Jacob Whitman was born Sept. 30, 1924, in the New York borough of Brooklyn and grew up in the Bronx. His parents were Jewish refugees from Poland who bought felt from factories in New England and sold it to makers of ladies’ hats in New York.\nDuring World War II, he served as a medic in the U.S. Navy. He later said the day the Navy discharged him in 1946 was the happiest of his life because after that he didn’t have to obey orders from anyone.\nUsing his GI Bill benefits, he earned a business degree from Syracuse University in 1949. He then studied economics at Princeton University and received a master’s in that subject from the New School for Social Research in New York.\nEarly in his career, he worked as an analyst for Shearson Hammill & Co. In 1974, he set up his own firm and invested in mortgage bonds issued by the bankrupt Penn Central Railroad. He founded Third Avenue Management in 1986.\nWhile other fund managers strove to avoid buying securities of companies likely to default, Mr. Whitman focused on exactly what would happen if there was a default. He sometimes sought high-yielding debt on which payments were likely to continue even if the company went through a bankruptcy. In general, he aimed to get a deep discount on securities of a business he understood run by people he trusted.\nMr. Whitman served on a commission that investigated the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear-power accident. He funded the Whitman Family Center for Coexistence at Tel Aviv University to provide scholarships for underprivileged students, including Palestinians and Israeli Arabs, and promote better relations between Israel and neighboring countries.\nHe is survived by his wife of 62 years, the former Lois Quick, a lawyer and social worker who founded the Children’s Rights Division of Human Rights Watch, as well as their three children and six grandchildren.\nMr. Whitman was a pioneer in casual dress. Unless he had an important meeting, he wore khaki pants and sweatshirts to work. For many years, he walked 3 miles each way between his Upper West Side home and his Third Avenue office. More recently, he took the subway or bus.",
