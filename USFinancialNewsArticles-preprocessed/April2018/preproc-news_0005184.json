FILE PHOTO: A bird flies by the Vedanta office building in Mumbai August 16, 2010. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/File Photo \nIndia’s Supreme Court in February quashed all iron ore mining permits in the southwestern state of Goa, one of the top producing states for the steel making raw material. \n“The State of Goa will ensure and confirm that only \nthat iron ore is loaded which is royalty paid and which \nis lying in the jetties on or before 15th March, 2018,” the judges wrote in the order. \nThe top court’s ban brought mining in the low-quality iron ore producing state to a halt, putting companies and thousands of jobs in jeopardy. \nThe move provides relief to miners including Vedanta and several small unlisted companies run by local business families. \nThe London-listed company said last month it would likely record an impairment charge of up to $600 million following the closure of its iron ore business in Goa.
