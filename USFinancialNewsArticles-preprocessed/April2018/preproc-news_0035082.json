Additionally, ZeroFOX recently hired Todd Laughman as Head of U.S. Sales and Brian Cyr as the company’s first General Counsel earlier this year. As one of the country’s foremost experts on intellectual property (IP), Dr. Small will continue to invest, build upon and protect ZeroFOX’s proprietary platform and continued growth.\n“The social media landscape has never been more vulnerable and ZeroFOX is leading the global charge to ensure security is top of mind when it comes to interacting with these platforms,” said James C. Foster, CEO of ZeroFOX . “Our recent hires bring a vast amount of legal, privacy, compliance and security expertise, adding to the world-class team supporting our enterprise customers. As we enter our next phase of growth, Sam will help us drive security both internally at ZeroFOX and for our customers.”\nAt ZeroFOX, Dr. Small will drive ZeroFOX’s security vision both internally and externally for customers. Dr. Small will work directly with customers at the CXO level to deliver the company's services and technology as well as infusing the ZeroFOX Platform with his expertise. Finally, Dr. Small will help oversee all ZeroFOX’s IP and internal security operations.\n“ZeroFOX’s team is committed to delivering the people, technology and processes that will keep our customers secure on social media,” said Dr. Small. “They’ve architected a scalable platform to solve enterprise social media and digital security challenges both now and in the future, and I look forward to being part of this forward-thinking team.”\nPrior to being named CSO, Dr. Small served on ZeroFOX’s Board of Advisors. He was also the CEO and Founder of Fast Orientation, an enterprise security software startup. Additionally, after earning his doctorate in computer science from Johns Hopkins University, he led an academic security research lab and launched two security startups. His work and research has been covered in publications including WIRED, The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNET and New Scientist.\nTo find out more information about ZeroFOX or to join our team, please visit: https://www.zerofox.com .\nAbout ZeroFOX\nZeroFOX, the",
