    "text": "TOKYO, April 4 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks edged lower on Wednesday morning in choppy trade as the stronger yen soured sentiment, offsetting gains in some automakers after their strong U.S. sales numbers.\nThe Nikkei dropped 0.2 percent to 21,258.02 in midmorning trade, after trading in positive territory earlier.\nThe dollar eased against the yen, with the outlook clouded by worries that escalating U.S.-China trade tensions could take a toll on the global economy.\nTech shares continued to struggle, with Tokyo Electron dropping 2.2 percent, Advantest Corp falling 1.4 percent and TDK Corp shedding 1.5 percent.\nMajor automakers on Tuesday reported higher new vehicles sales for March on the back of a strong U.S. economy and big consumer discounts.\nHonda Motor Co rose 1.1 percent after it said its March sales rose 3.8 percent, thanks largely to SUV and pickup truck sales.\nMazda Motor Corp gained 1.3 percent, Mitsubishi Motors Corp climbed 1.7 percent and Subaru Corp jumped 1.9 percent after marking respective increases of 35.7 percent, 21.7 percent and 5.9 percent.\nThe broader Topix declined 0.1 percent to 1,701.89.\nReporting by Ayai Tomisawa Editing by Shri Navaratnam\n ",
