    "text": "LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Plaintiffs’ class action litigation firm Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP is proud to announce that Robert I. Harwood, Daniella Quitt, Matthew M. Houston, and Benjamin I. Sachs-Michaels of Harwood Feffer LLP have joined the firm’s litigation practice focusing on shareholder class and derivative actions and ERISA litigation.\nMessrs. Harwood, Houston, and Sachs-Michaels, and Ms. Quitt have been acknowledged by courts and their peers to be leaders in the plaintiffs’ shareholder advocacy bar. They have developed new law in the areas of tender offers, fiduciary duty of corporate insiders to public stockholders in mergers and takeovers, and general principles of required disclosure to stockholders and institutional investors in public companies. They have been designated as lead or co-lead counsel in numerous complex actions involving shareholder rights and corporate governance and ERISA actions and their skill and expertise has led to recovery of substantial monetary and equitable benefits for investors, stockholders, corporations, and participants and beneficiaries of employer-sponsored benefit plans.\nLionel Z. Glancy states: “The wealth of knowledge and experience held by these attorneys will add considerable value to the firm’s advocacy efforts on behalf of investors, employees, and consumers.”\nRobert I. Harwood states: “We are looking forward to working with the Glancy firm, which has been at the forefront of shareholder rights advocacy for more than two decades. The combination of our practices will enhance our ability to pursue justice on behalf of corporate shareholders.”\nAbout GPM: Founded over 25 years ago by senior partner Lionel Z. Glancy, GPM is based in Los Angeles with offices in New York City and Berkeley. Recognized as one of the premier plaintiffs’ law firms in the country, GPM has recovered billions of dollars for parties wronged by corporate fraud, malfeasance, unfair business practices, and antitrust violations.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180430006190/en/\nGlancy Prongay and Murray LLP, Los Angeles, California\nLionel Glancy, (310) 201-9150\nSource: Glancy Prongay & Murray LLP",
