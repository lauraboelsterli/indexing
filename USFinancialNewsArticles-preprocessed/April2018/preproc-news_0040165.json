    "text": "STOCKHOLM, April 18 (Reuters) - Sweden’s Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) has withdrawn the operating licence of corporate finance firm Remium Nordic AB after breaches in internal controls and risk management, the watchdog said on Wednesday.\nRemium was warned and fined 3.5 million Swedish crowns ($415,000) by the FSA last year over similar issues.\nThe FSA said that flaws in risk management and internal controls meant that Remium “had not made the impairment tests required and consequently had not made sufficient writedowns in its credit portfolio”.\nThe authority also said there were concerns about Remium’s ownership structure.\n“The ownership situation and the company’s ties with other companies are hard to clarify both for the FSA and for external parties and furthermore hamper the FSA’s oversight,” the FSA said in a statement.\nRemium, which operates equity research, corporate finance and asset management services, did not respond immediately to Reuters’ repeated phone calls and emails seeking comment.\nThe FSA said that Remium managed roughly 420 million crowns in deposits and had provided liquidity guarantees for about 50 corporate clients.\nSweden’s deposit guarantee scheme covers savers’ deposits up to 950,000 Swedish crowns. It was not immediately clear whether the guarantee would be triggered. ($1 = 8.4200 Swedish crowns) (Reporting by Stockholm Newsroom Editing by Niklas Pollard and David Goodman)\n ",
