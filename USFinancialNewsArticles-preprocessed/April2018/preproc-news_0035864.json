Non-regulated revenues gained 8.4%, to $12.2 million from the prior year’s $11.2 million due to increased broadband and competitive local exchange carrier (“CLEC”) revenues. Regulated revenues increase 1.0%, to $15.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 from the prior year’s $14.9 million.\nEBITDA before corporate costs was $13.0 million as compared to $11.6 million in the previous year’s first quarter, an 11.4% increase. Non-regulated EBITDA, including affiliate distributions, rose 20.0% to $5.5 million, from $4.6 million, while regulated EBITDA increased to $7.4 million, from $7.0 million.\nFULL YEAR RESULTS –The Company continues to forecast that revenues for 2018 will approximate $110 million and EBITDA before corporate costs, charitable contributions and non-operating income will approximate $50 million.\nEARNINGS PER SHARE – Diluted earnings per share during the first quarter were $235 per share in 2018 as compared to $170 per share in 2017. Shares outstanding at March 31, 2018, were 20,427 versus 20,509 at December 31, 2017.\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES – In the first quarter 2017, capital expenditures were $5.2 million, of which $2.7 million was for non-regulated activities and $2.5 million for regulated activities. In order to expand the Company’s non-regulated fiber initiatives and provide a high level of broadband to our customers in the rural areas of the United States, we are expecting capital expenditures of $21 million in 2018. This capital enables us to offer enhanced broadband speeds and will increase the overall fiber route miles in our network. As of March 31, 2018, LICT operations deployed 4,500 miles of fiber optic cable, 12,041 miles of copper cable, and 687 miles of coaxial cable.\nLIQUIDITY EVENT FROM INVESTMENT IN SPECTRUM ACQUISITION COMPANY – LICT has previously noted a liquidity event with regard to an investment in PTPMS Communications, LLC (“PTPMS”). On February 28, 2018, the Straight Path transaction closed and the Company is in the process of negotiating for our share of the net proceeds from this transaction.\nBALANCE SHEET – Our net debt was $19.0 million at March 31, 2018, as compared to $23.9 million on December 31, 2017.\nREFINANCING THE COMPANY – The Board of Directors and management have implemented measures which have improved liquidity and reduced the Company’s debt position. At this time, the Board continues to re-evaluate its refinancing alternatives.\nSHARE REPURCHASES – During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 117 shares for $1.4 million, with an average price of $11,758 per share. In addition, in the first quarter of 2018, 35 shares were issued under the Company’s Restricted Stock Awards program. As of March 31, 2018, 20,427 shares were outstanding.\nTAX CUTS AND JOBS ACT - On December 22, 2017, the United States Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Act”). Two aspects of this Act significantly impacted LICT: (a) reducing the Federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, from LICT’s 35% 2017 rate, (b) 100% expensing of capital expenditures through 2023, after which the expensing percentage phases down. The change in the Federal tax rate reduced our liability for deferred income taxes at the end of 2017 by $7.1 million, and lower over effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 to 26.4%, from 38.5% in the first quarter of 2017. The rate reduction and 100% expensing of capital expenditures will reduce our 2018 tax payments.\nOPERATING STATISTICS – As of March 31, 2018, the Company’s DSL penetration in its franchised telephone service territories, based on its total Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier (“ILEC”) voice lines, was 80.4%, compared to 79.5% as of December 31, 2017.
