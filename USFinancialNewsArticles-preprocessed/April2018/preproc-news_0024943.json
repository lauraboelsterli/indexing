    "text": "(Adds details, background)\nApril 11 (Reuters) - The family of a driver killed in a Tesla car crash has hired law firm Minami Tamaki LLP to explore legal options, the law firm said on Wednesday, adding the autopilot feature in the electric carmaker's vehicle probably caused his death.\nLast month, Walter Huang died in a crash and vehicle fire in a Tesla Inc Model X near Mountain View, California, prompting a federal field investigation.\nTesla later said the car had activated its Autopilot system, raising new questions about the semi-autonomous system that handles some driving tasks. The company said vehicle logs from the accident showed no action had been taken by Huang soon before the crash and that he had received earlier warnings to put his hands on the wheel.\nThe law firm said its preliminary review suggested the autopilot was defective and had uncovered complaints by other Tesla drivers of navigational errors by the feature.\n\"(Our) preliminary review indicates that the navigation system of the Tesla may have misread the lane lines on the roadway, failed to detect the concrete median, failed to brake the car, and drove the car into the median,\" Minami said.\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
