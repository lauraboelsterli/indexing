    "text": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian presidency posted a video that appeared to show President Bashar al-Assad arriving for work on Saturday hours after a U.S.-led strike on Syria in response to a suspected chemical weapon attack.\n“The morning of resilience,” declared a caption accompanying the video circulated on the presidency’s Telegram feed, which showed Assad in a suit and tie and carrying a briefcase as he walked into the marble-floored entrance of a building.\nAssad did not speak during the video which lasted 8 seconds.\nWriting by Tom Perry; Editing by Samia Nakhoul\n ",
