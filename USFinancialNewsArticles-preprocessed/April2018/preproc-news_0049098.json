    "text": "Published: Apr 23, 2018 7:43 a.m. ET Share \nAt least 4 North Koreans also reportedly killed CCTV Chinese state television footage of a bus crash in North Korea that left dozens, reportedly mostly Chinese tourists, dead. \nBy Chun Han Wong \nBEIJING—A tour-bus accident in North Korea on Sunday left at least 36 people dead, most of them Chinese nationals, China’s Foreign Ministry said. \nForeign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told reporters on Monday that the “severe traffic accident” killed 32 Chinese tourists and four North Koreans, while two other Chinese nationals were severely injured. He didn’t provide further details about the accident. \nChinese state television aired footage appearing to show an overturned bus, without providing details about the vehicle or the number of casualties. The footage also showed emergency crews at the scene under heavy rain and medical personnel attending to a patient. \nChinese diplomats, accompanied by North Korean counterparts, had rushed to the scene, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a brief statement earlier Monday. It later said a Chinese medical team was en route to North Korea to provide assistance. \nAn international arm of state-run broadcaster China Central Television tweeted Monday morning that more than 30 people died after a tour bus fell from a bridge. That tweet was later deleted. ",
