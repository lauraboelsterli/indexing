    "text": "Eric Thames hit another homer against the Cincinnati Reds and Zach Davies worked around three errors leading the Milwaukee Brewers to a 2-0 victory Wednesday afternoon at Miller Park.\nThames homered for the second straight game after an 0-for-11 skid, and six of his last eight hits are homers. His two-run shot to right-center field in the third off Tyler Mahle’s 1-0 slider was his 12th in 19 career games against the Reds.\nMilwaukee also has five homers in its last 70 innings at home, and Thames has four of those.\nDavies (1-2) helped the Brewers get their second straight shutout by allowing three hits in 6 1/3 innings. Davies recorded 11 ground-ball outs while throwing 93 pitches.\nHe escaped runners on first and third following an error by Christian Yelich in center field by getting two groundouts to end the first. He escaped runners on first and third again in the fourth following an error by Thames at first base.\nDavies was lifted after speedster Billy Hamilton’s ground ball trickled under second baseman Jonathan Villar in the seventh, putting runners at first and third.\nDan Jennings ended the threat by getting Jesse Winker to hit into a double play started by shortstop Orlando Arcia. Jacob Barnes recorded the final six outs and notched his second save of the season.\nYelich reached base three times in his first game since April 4 after missing two weeks with an oblique injury.\nThe Brewers posted consecutive shutouts at home for the first since blanking the Miami Marlins in three straight July 19-21, 2013.\nCincinnati was shut out for the fourth time this season and has mustered six hits in the last two games after getting a 10-4 victory on Monday. At 3-15, the Reds are off to their worst start since opening 1931 with 16 losses in 18 games.\nMahle (1-3) allowed two runs and seven hits in five innings.\nCincinnati also was blanked in consecutive games for the first time since Aug. 27-28, 2015.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
