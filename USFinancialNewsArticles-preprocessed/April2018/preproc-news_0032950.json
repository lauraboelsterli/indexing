    "text": "0 COMMENTS Omnicom OMC 1.01% Group’s revenue grew slightly in the first quarter, even as the advertising company faced continuing headwinds from client losses and changing client needs.\nThe company reported a 1.2% increase in revenue to $3.63 billion, meeting analyst expectations. The company reported a 2.4% increase in revenue from organic growth -- a key metric that strips out acquisitions, dispositions and foreign-exchange fluctuations.\nIn North America, organic revenue decreased 0.1%, due to weakness in Canada and Puerto Rico, as well as client losses and shifts in spending in the U.S., said Omnicom Chief Executive John Wren.\nMarketers are “rapidly adjusting their businesses to keep pace with technological disruption, new competitors and evolving consumer behaviors,” Mr. Wren said on the company’s earnings call Tuesday. “Today, our clients more than ever before, need a valued partner to help solve business problems and grow through the lens of marketing.”\nThe ad holding company, which owns creative agencies BBDO and DDB, as well as media buying shops OMD and PHD, reported earnings as headlines swirl around rival WPP.\nWPP, the largest ad holding company in the world, in March reported its worst performance for 2017 since the financial crisis. Adding to its woes, the company this past week announced that its chief executive, Martin Sorrell, would step down amid a board probe into an allegation of personal misconduct. Mr. Sorrell has denied the allegation.\nThe news led to speculation about what a new leader, once appointed, will do to get WPP back on a growth track. Some analysts wondered if WPP will sell its data assets, including Kantar Media.\nIf WPP sells Kantar or its other data assets, Omnicom isn’t likely to be a buyer. That’s not a “key focus” for the company’s acquisition strategy, said Mr. Wren. “In many ways, I have a great deal of respect for Martin,” he said. “I know he was in the process of evaluating his own portfolio. I don’t know what conclusion the new leadership will reach.”\nOmnicom said it will continue to invest in talent and technology as the “marketing environment increases in complexity.” It’s also moving toward more custom Omnicom-level solutions for clients that incorporate resources from various agencies and disciplines -- a shift from the model in which clients work with one agency. As a result, client conflicts are “far less of an issue,” he said.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 increased 9.2%, to $264.1 million. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018 increased 12 cents, or 11.8%, to $1.14 per share, compared to $1.02 per share for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe company said it’s still cycling through client losses from earlier in 2017. At the same time, it’s adjusting to a shift in the way some clients buy digital media. Some clients are moving from buying digital media through an offering that bundles media and other service and tech fees, to an offering that provides more transparency into the unbundled services and costs.\n“That has an impact,” said Mr. Wren. If you’re just focused on top-line growth, your reaction might be, “Oh my god,” he said. However, if someone is focused on “substance and profitability of the business, it’s actually a growing area.”\nWrite to Alexandra Bruell at alexandra.bruell@wsj.com",
