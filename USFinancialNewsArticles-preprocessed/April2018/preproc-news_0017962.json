Russian President Vladimir Putin attends the Orthodox Easter service at the Christ the Saviour Cathedral in Moscow, Russia April 8, 2018. Alexander Zemlianichenko/Pool via REUTERS \nSpeaking at a Kremlin ceremony where new foreign ambassadors to Moscow presented their credentials, Putin told the envoy from Montenegro: “The current state of affairs in Russia-Montenegro relations clearly does not correspond to the centuries-old traditions of brotherly friendship and spiritual affinity between our peoples.” \n“Russia is in favour of developing links with Montenegro on a mutually beneficial basis,” Putin said. \nRussia was angered by Montenegro’s accession last year to the NATO military alliance.
