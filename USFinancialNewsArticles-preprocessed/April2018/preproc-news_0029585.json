    "text": "9 COMMENTS Michigan State University interim president John Engler offered a woman $250,000 to settle her sexual-abuse lawsuit against the university and former MSU doctor Larry Nassar, without her lawyer present, the woman told the school’s board of trustees Friday.\nThe woman, Kaylee Lorincz, also said Mr. Engler played down the behavior of William Strampel, Dr. Nassar’s boss and the former dean of MSU’s College of Osteopathic Medicine, who himself has been arrested and charged with sexual misconduct . Mr. Strampel was arraigned March 27 and wasn’t asked to enter a plea. His lawyer didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Friday.\nDr. Nassar, a 54-year-old former longtime sports-medicine doctor at MSU, is serving a 60-year sentence in federal prison . He pleaded guilty last year to state sexual-abuse and federal child-pornography charges.\nMr. Engler, who is a former Michigan governor, attended the board meeting where Ms. Lorincz made her allegation, according to an MSU official. He released a statement later Friday: “Our memories and interpretations of the March 28 meeting are different than hers. I am sorry if anything said during the meeting was misunderstood. Regardless, since mediation of all claims begins on April 25, there will be an appropriate place for discussions concerning what would be a fair and equitable resolution.”\nMSU trustee Brian Mosallam, responding to an email from The Wall Street Journal after the Quote: : “If Kaylee Lorincz’s story is correct, I am beyond disturbed. I’m disgusted.”\nMs. Lorincz told the board that on March 28, she and her mother ran into Mr. Engler and asked to speak with him so she could share her story. He agreed, and about half an hour later Mr. Engler and at least one other university official met with Ms. Lorincz and her mother in a conference room, Ms. Lorincz said.\n“Mr. Engler then looked directly at me and asked, ‘Right now if I wrote you a check for $250,000 would you take it?’” Ms. Lorincz told the board on Friday. “When I explained that it’s not about the money for me and that I just want to help, he said, ‘Well give me a number.’ He also said that he had met with Rachael Denhollander and that she gave him a number.\n“I felt like I was being bullied into saying something and that if Rachael gave him a settlement amount, it was OK for me to do it too.”\nMs. Denhollander was the first woman to go public with claims against Dr. Nassar in 2016. In an email to The Wall Street Journal on Friday, Ms. Denhollander wrote that she hadn’t met with Engler nor discussed a settlement amount. “I’m disgusted and appalled that President Engler would lie to and attempt to deceive a survivor of Larry Nassar,” Ms. Denhollander wrote.\nMs. Lorincz recalled that Mr. Engler “started saying how sad it was that hundreds of good osteopathic doctors at MSU are being judged by one—one—bad doctor.”\n“My mom interrupted and said, ‘Well what about former Dean Strampel? Wasn’t he just arrested?’ President Engler rolled his eyes and attempted to fluff it off and said, ‘Oh that was no big deal, it was only just a slap on the butt,’” according to Ms. Lorincz.\nAfter she and her mother expressed shock, Ms. Lorincz recalled, “President Engler then tried to back up his statement saying, ‘Well there are different degrees of murder.’”\nMs. Lorincz is among more than 250 people suing Michigan State and others in federal court, alleging that the university failed to protect them from Dr. Nassar. Last month, the plaintiffs and defendants said they planned to begin mediation talks to resolve the suits. Over the course of his more-than-two-decade career, Dr. Nassar was a faculty member at MSU’s College of Osteopathic Medicine and worked as a team doctor for USA Gymnastics, treating numerous Olympians.\nRevelations of Dr. Nassar’s crimes spurred leadership overhauls at USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee and Michigan State, where the president and athletic director resigned. The financial fallout related to Dr. Nassar could cost Michigan State more than $500 million , a recent analysis by the Journal found.\n— Rebecca Davis O’Brien contributed to this article.\nWrite to Rachel Bachman at rachel.bachman@wsj.com",
