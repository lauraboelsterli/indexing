    "text": "April 22, 2018 / 5:21 PM / Updated 12 minutes ago Fresenius pulls out of Akorn takeover over data integrity Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBERLIN (Reuters) - German healthcare group Fresenius SE ( FREG.DE ) said it had decided to pull out of its planned acquisition of Akorn ( AKRX.O ) after its own investigation found data integrity breaches at the U.S. generic drug maker. \nFresenius agreed last year to buy the U.S. maker of liquid generic drugs for $4.75 billion (3.4 billion pounds) but the deal has been marred by allegations that Akorn breached U.S. Food and Drug Administration data integrity requirements related to product development. \n“Fresenius’ decision is based on, among other factors, material breaches of FDA data integrity requirements relating to Akorn’s operations found during Fresenius’ independent investigation,” it said in a statement on Sunday.
