    "text": "NEW YORK, April 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday said it sold $45 billion of one-month bills to the strongest demand in eight weeks, resulting in an interest rate of 1.620 percent that was the lowest rate in a month.\nThe ratio of bids to the amount offered was 3.25, which was higher than 2.90 at the one-month T-bill sale last week. This gauge on overall auction demand was the highest since 3.27 at the one-month bill auction on Feb. 13, Treasury data showed.\nReporting by Richard Leong\n ",
