    "text": "BERLIN, Cargill sees the global cocoa market broadly balanced in the current 2017/18 season, the company’s commercial director for cocoa said on Tuesday.\nWhile crops in West Africa got off to a strong start, production has tapered off, Cargill’s Francesca Kleemans told Reuters on the sidelines of a conference in Berlin.\nKleemans pegged this on a combination of drier weather earlier in the season and the impact of depressed global prices.
