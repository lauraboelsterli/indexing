    "text": "Mitch Haniger might not be batting No. 4 anymore with the return from injury of Nelson Cruz, but he is still cleaning up.\nHaniger, hitting sixth in the lineup, homered for the second consecutive night and drove in three runs as the Seattle Mariners won their fourth game in a row, defeating the visiting Oakland Athletics 10-8 Saturday at Safeco Field.\nHaniger, who is tied for the American League lead with 15 RBIs, drove in four runs in the series opener Friday, including a three-run shot in the seventh inning to erase an Oakland lead.\nRight-hander Chasen Bradford (1-0) got the victory Saturday with 1 2/3 scoreless innings of relief, and Edwin Diaz pitched a scoreless ninth for his AL-leading sixth save.\nA’s starter Kendall Graveman (0-3) gave up five runs on eight hits in four innings as his ERA soared to 9.87.\nSeattle’s Jean Segura, Kyle Seager and Daniel Vogelbach and Oakland’s Mark Canha, Khris Davis and Stephen Piscotty also homered. Vogelbach’s solo shot in the seventh traveled 433 feet, just clearing the bull’s-eye on the Hit It Here Cafe that is on the second deck in right field.\nMariners manager Scott Servais successfully challenged two calls — one that ultimately cost his team the lead and the other that helped Seattle keep it.\nWith the A’s trailing 3-0, two outs and Jonathan Lucroy on first base in the top of the third, Oakland’s Marcus Semien hit a ball down the left field line that bounced on the warning track, glanced off the top of the wall and ricocheted off the bottom of the grandstand and away from left fielder Ichiro Suzuki. Shortstop Segura’s relay throw to the plate skipped away from catcher David Freitas, allowing Lucroy to score. Semien tried to make it home, but Freitas flipped the ball to pitcher Marco Gonzales, who tagged out Semien to end the inning with the score 3-1.\nServais came out to request a video review that turned the play into a ground-rule double, putting runners at second and third with two outs and taking the run off the scoreboard.\nThat ended up costing the Mariners, as Canha hit a two-run single to left field and Jed Lowrie followed with run-scoring single to right, tying the game at 3-3.\nHaniger snapped the tie with a two-run single in the bottom of the inning.\nIn the fourth, the Athletics’ Matt Chapman led off with a double and Matt Olson was hit by a pitch. Lucroy lined out to center field with Chapman taking third. Piscotty singled to center to score Chapman and send Olson to third.\nThat was it for Gonzales, who lasted just 3 1/3 innings, giving up four runs on five hits. The left-hander walked one and struck out five.\nWith Bradford coming in from the bullpen, A’s manager Bob Melvin sent left-handed hitting Matt Joyce up to pinch-hit for Trayce Thompson.\nJoyce grounded to second baseman Robinson Cano, forcing out Piscotty at second but scoring Olson to tie it as Joyce was ruled safe at first. Servais challenged that call, and Joyce was called out for a double play, ending the inning with Seattle holding a 5-4 lead.\nA three-run fifth, sparked by Haniger’s solo homer to right field, gave the Mariners an 8-4 advantage.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
