    "text": "Your next co-worker may be a humanoid avatar robot\nOn the surface it sounds impractical and unwieldy, especially if you are accustomed to a hierarchical, command-and-control environment found in a Fortune 1000 company. However, a new class of software, called DAOs or Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, are emerging to enable decentralized decision-making at a global scale.\nOne new blockchain-based project, DAOstack , is building a \"Wordpress for DAOs.\" Their vision is to enable anyone to roll out a DAO with governance components at low cost and high speed. There are a number of other start-ups in the space, and interest among the crypto-enthusiasts has exploded in the past few months. We should start seeing more and more DAOs hit the market toward the end of 2018, paving the way for a more trust-based, collaborative future of work that you actually enjoy more. \"Blockchains provide an opportunity to share long-term value and ownership with a wider net of people who are responsible for the success of any given endeavor.\" -Chelsea Rustrum, author of It's a Shareable Life and founder of Blockchain for Good in San Francisco.\n\"Instead of automating away jobs, technology could augment our ability to collectively solve problems,\" says David Passiak, author of Empower: How to Co-Create the Future. \"With the help of DAOs, humans can become more creative and intelligent than we ever imagined.\" Running on blockchain systems, the members of an organization can set rules for behavior, collective decision-making, funding, governance, hiring and firing. Those rules can be enforced without the need for a procurement officer, HR, accounts payable or marketing. \"Code is law\" is a frequently cited motto among blockchain believers, but for organizations a slightly better approach may be \"Code is policy.\" The rules of engagement\nBy automating management of organizations and, by extension, teams and projects within those organizations, DAOs offer extreme flexibility to project leaders. They will have the ability to assemble the necessary workforce skills coordinated around value delivery from contributors with known reputation and/or skills. The rules of engagement and compensation will be clear and followed. You will know, from the outset, how much your contribution is worth to the overall success of the team's efforts and, how much you could earn if your teammates and colleagues think you are a rock star. The same will be true of them.\n\"Blockchain technology makes it easier to pay people for the value of their work as it happens,\" says Chelsea Rustrum, author of It's a Shareable Life and founder of Blockchain for Good in San Francisco. Blockchains enable \"smart contracts,\" which are agreements that are automatically executed based on given criteria without the need for human intervention. This means, for example, that when a customer pays an invoice, all of the participants in the project are paid immediately without the need for separate invoices or checks. Even better, Rustrum says \"blockchains provide an opportunity to share long-term value and ownership with a wider net of people who are responsible for the success of any given endeavor.\"\nAll of those data points, collected and secured in the blockchain for future use, will be connected to your profile and used to your advantage (hopefully) for the subsequent project. Over time, as people acquire new skills and demonstrate proficiency in contributing meaningfully to a project, each of us will have the opportunity to get utilized in projects where we contribute the most value and, in turn, get the highest possible compensation. Imagine that, you'll get to do what you are really good at doing ... and get paid for it. It may not even feel like work at some point. Embracing change and uncertainty\nWhat's more, with known reputation scores and collective action, it is unlikely that a \"favorite of the boss\" will get the accolades in front of a client when everyone else knows that he did nothing of value. Lastly, people in need of assistance will have the opportunity to select from a known pool of talent to meet their needs for a given task, not just whoever is on the company payroll at the time.\nBest of all, a hiring policy such as \"We only take 5-star performers\" or \"Every project must have one person with a 0 reputation score so we can help someone get a leg up,\" or \"We must have one minority or veteran on this project\" can be enforced. Moreover, the policy can be decided collectively, not by the VP of HR. Again, trust at scale.\nFinally, because of so-called \"smart contracts,\" getting plugged into payment systems will become increasingly frictionless. No more deadweight loss due to contract signings, billing, expense reports and collections.\nAll of this change may sound discomforting and certainly unfamiliar. However, with 70 percent of people disengaged at work , it seems fairly clear that many people would prefer an alternative to the status quo. Supported by systems of global trust, secured by blockchains, the day may soon come where you are able to do more of what you are really good at and get paid for it, all without a boss.\nâ€” Jeremy Epstein, CEO of Never Stop Marketing",
