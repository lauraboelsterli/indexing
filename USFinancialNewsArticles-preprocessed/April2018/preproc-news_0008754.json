After stints at American Airlines and Sabre, Keszler ran the corporate travel side of Travelocity as President of Travelocity Business. During her storied career in the travel industry, Keszler has grown to truly understand the world of the business traveler in companies of all sizes.\n“I'm very happy to be joining the Shep board. Daniel and the team have developed a very simple and elegant solution to help companies manage their travel spend without forcing their travelers to use a specific booking site or travel agency.” – Ellen Keszler\nFounded in late 2016, Complai’s flagship product, Shep, is a travel tool with today’s business travelers in mind that allows travelers to book business travel on consumer sites while tracking their spending through a browser extension. The tool is a lightweight solution that allows small to medium-sized enterprises to use automated tracking to save on their second largest controllable expense, business travel.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180405005273/en/\nComplai\nDaniel Senyard, 512-921-4769\nDaniel@sheptravel.com\nSource: Complai",
