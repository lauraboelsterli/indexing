REUTERS/Ian Vogler/Pool Lubomirski also did the couple’s engagement photos, and he is a former assistant to Mario Testino, who was famed for his photos of Harry’s late mother Princess Diana.\n“I could not be more thrilled or honored to photograph this historic occasion,” Lubomirski said in a statement. “Having taken Prince Harry and Ms. Markle’s engagement photos, it brings me such joy to be able to witness again, the next chapter in this wonderful love story.”\nQueen Elizabeth’s 33-year-old grandson, Harry, fifth-in-line to the throne, and Markle, 36, who starred in the U.S. TV legal drama “Suits”, will marry in Windsor on May 19.\nReporting by Alistair Smout; editing by Michael Holden\n ",
