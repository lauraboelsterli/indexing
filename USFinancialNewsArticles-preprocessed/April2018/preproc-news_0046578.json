    "text": "GLENDALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PS Business Parks, Inc. (NYSE:PSB) reported operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nOperating Results for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018\nNet income allocable to common shareholders was $46.0 million, or $1.69 per diluted common share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $19.7 million, or 74.5%, from $26.4 million, or $0.97 per diluted common share, for the same period in 2017. The increase was mainly due to the gain on sale of Corporate Pointe Business Park located in Orange County, California, and an increase in net operating income (“NOI”–described below) with respect to our real estate facilities. The increase in NOI includes a $445,000 increase for our Same Park facilities (described below) due primarily to an increase in rental rates.\nFunds from Operations\nFunds from operations (“FFO”) per share was $1.59 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $1.52 for the same period in 2017, an increase of $0.07 per share. FFO, which is described in more detail below, is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) measure defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts and generally represents net income before depreciation, gains and losses from sales and impairment charges with respect to real estate assets.\nProperty Operations–Same Park Portfolio\nTo evaluate the ongoing performance of the Company’s portfolio over comparable periods, management analyzes the operating performance of properties owned and operated throughout both periods (the “Same Park” facilities). The Same Park portfolio includes all properties we owned and operated as of March 31, 2018 that were acquired prior to January 1, 2016, except for the properties described below under “Property Dispositions.” For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Same Park facilities constitute 26.9 million rentable square feet, representing 96.4% of the 27.9 million rentable square feet in the Company’s total portfolio as of March 31, 2018.\nThe following table presents the operating results of the Company’s Same Park facilities for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 (unaudited, in thousands, except per square foot amounts):\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Change Rental income $ 98,022 $ 95,756 2.4 % Adjusted cost of operations (1) (3) 30,035 28,214 6.5 % Net operating income (2) (3) $ 67,987 $ 67,542 0.7 % Selected Statistical Data Gross margin (4)\n69.4 % 70.5 % (1.6 %) Weighted average square foot occupancy 94.6 % 94.6 % — Annualized rental income per occupied square foot $ 15.40 $ 15.05 2.3 % (1) Adjusted cost of operations excludes Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (“LTEIP”) amortization, which can vary significantly period to period based upon the performance of the whole company, rather than just property operations. (2) We evaluate the performance of our business parks primarily based on NOI, a non-GAAP financial measure, because we believe NOI is an important measure of the value and performance of our real estate. We believe investors utilize NOI in a similar manner and for similar reasons. We define NOI as rental income less adjusted cost of operations. NOI excludes depreciation and amortization because management and investors do not consider it important in valuing real estate or evaluating real estate performance, because depreciation assumes the value of real estate declines ratably from its historical cost based upon the passage of time, while we believe the value of real estate changes based upon cash flow and other market factors. (3) Our calculation of adjusted cost of operations and NOI may not be comparable to those of other companies and should not be used as an alternative to measure performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. See “Reconciliation of Selected non-GAAP Measures to Analogous GAAP Measures” below for reconciliations of each of these measures to their closest analogous GAAP measure on our income statements. (4) Computed by dividing NOI by rental income. The following table summarizes selected quarterly financial data with respect to the Same Park facilities (unaudited, in thousands, except per square foot amounts):\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31 June 30 September 30 December 31 Rental income 2018 $ 98,022 $ — $ — $ — 2017 $ 95,756 $ 95,464 $ 96,073 $ 97,211 Adjusted cost of operations 2018 $ 30,035 $ — $ — $ — 2017 $ 28,214 $ 28,008 $ 29,191 $ 29,642 Snow removal 2018 $ 794 $ — $ — $ — 2017 $ 378 $ 103 $ — $ 63 Utilities 2018 $ 5,713 $ — $ — $ — 2017 $ 5,448 $ 5,295 $ 5,798 $ 5,393 Weighted average square foot occupancy 2018 94.6 % — — — 2017 94.6 % 93.7 % 94.1 % 95.1 % Annualized rental income per occupied square foot 2018 $ 15.40 $ — $ — $ — 2017 $ 15.05 $ 15.15 $ 15.18 $ 15.20 Multi-Family Update\nDue to an amendment to the joint venture agreement that provides the Company control of the joint venture, effective January 1, 2018, the Company began consolidating Highgate at the Mile, the Company’s multi-family joint venture in Tysons, Virginia. As of March 31, 2018, Highgate was 61.5% occupied.\nProperty Dispositions\nOn March 5, 2018, we sold Corporate Pointe Business Park, a park consisting of five multi-tenant office buildings totaling 161,000 square feet in Orange County, California, for net proceeds of $41.7 million, which resulted in a gain of $26.8 million.\nSubsequent to March 31, 2018, we completed the sale of Orange County Business Center, a park consisting of five multi-tenant office buildings totaling 437,000 square feet, located in Orange County, California, for net proceeds of $73.3 million resulting in a gain of approximately $50 million.\nIn 2018, we expect to sell another 107,000 rentable square feet of office product in Orange County, California, and 194,000 square feet of flex product in Dallas, Texas. There can be no assurance that sales will be completed.\nDistributions Declared\nOn April 24, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.85 per common share. Distributions were also declared on the various series of depositary shares, each representing 1/1,000 of a share of preferred stock. Distributions are payable on June 28, 2018 to shareholders of record on June 13, 2018.\nCompany Information\nPS Business Parks, Inc., a member of the S&P SmallCap 600, is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that acquires, develops, owns and operates commercial properties, primarily multi-tenant industrial, flex and office space. The Company defines “flex” space as buildings that are configured with a combination of office and warehouse space and can be designed to fit a number of uses (including office, assembly, showroom, laboratory, light manufacturing and warehouse space). As of March 31, 2018, the Company wholly owned 27.9 million rentable square feet with approximately 4,900 commercial customers in six states and a 95.0% interest in a 395-unit apartment complex.\nForward-Looking Statements\nWhen used within this press release, the words “may,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “plans,” “expects,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “intends” and similar expressions are intended to identify “ .” Such involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, which may cause the actual results and performance of the Company to be materially different from those expressed or implied in the .

FFO represents net income before real estate depreciation, gains or losses and impairment charges, which are excluded because they are based upon historical real estate costs and assume that building values diminish ratably over time, while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. FFO per share represents FFO allocable to common and dilutive shares, divided by aggregate common and dilutive shares. FAD represents FFO adjusted to (a) deduct capital expenditures that maintain the real estate values, tenant improvements and lease commissions and (b) eliminate certain non-cash expenses or income such as straight-line rent and non-cash stock compensation expense. We utilize FAD in evaluating our ongoing cash flow available for investment, debt repayment and common distributions. We believe investors and analysts utilize FAD in a similar manner. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO and FAD are not substitutes for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends, because they exclude investing and financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows. In addition, other REITs may compute these measures differently, so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful.\nPS BUSINESS PARKS, INC.
