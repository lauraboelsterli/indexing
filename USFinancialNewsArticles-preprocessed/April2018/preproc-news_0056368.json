Slideshow (2 Images)\nOn Monday, the Detroit carmaker reached a preliminary deal with its South Korean labor union, winning concessions on pay and bonuses, allowing the money-losing operation to avoid filing for bankruptcy protection.\nUnionized workers at GM Korea approved a tentative wage deal agreed with the automaker, which includes a base salary freeze and no bonuses for this year.\nThe automaker is currently in talks with the South Korean government over an injection of public funds to support the unit.\nGM and the state-run Korea Development Bank (KDB) are considering increasing the size of their investment from a previously proposed $2.8 billion, a senior government official said on Wednesday.\nThe U.S. automaker owns 77 percent of GM Korea. KDB holds 17 percent and China’s SAIC Motor Corp Ltd ( 600104.SS ) controls the remaining 6 percent. Reporting by Jane Chung and Hyunjoo Jin; Writing by Ju-min Park; Editing by Edwina Gibbs",
