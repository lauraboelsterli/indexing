    "text": "MARKHAM, Ontario, April 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Extendicare Inc. (“Extendicare” or the “Company”) (TSX:EXE) announced today the closing of its previously announced public offering (the “Offering”) of $110 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00% convertible unsecured subordinated debentures due April 30, 2025 (the “Debentures”), which are convertible, at the option of the holder, into common shares of the Company at a conversion price of $12.25 per common share, on a bought deal basis with a syndicate of underwriters. The Debentures will commence trading today on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the “TSX”) under the symbol “EXE.DB.C”. Extendicare has granted the underwriters an over-allotment option, exercisable at any time up to 30 days following today's closing, to acquire up to an additional $16.5 million aggregate principal amount of Debentures for the purposes of covering the underwriters’ “over-allocation position”. The syndicate of underwriters led by RBC Capital Markets, includes BMO Capital Markets, CIBC World Markets Inc., TD Securities, National Bank Financial Inc., Scotiabank, and Echelon Wealth Partners Inc.\nAs previously announced, the net proceeds from the Offering will be used to partially fund the redemption of the Company’s outstanding 6.00% convertible unsecured subordinated debentures due September 30, 2019 (the “2019 Debentures”) trading on the TSX under the trading symbol “EXE.DB.B”. The 2019 Debentures will be redeemed on April 30, 2018 (the “Redemption Date”), for an aggregate redemption price equal to the sum of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Debentures ($126,500,000) and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to, but excluding, the Redemption Date, for a total of $1,004.93 for each $1,000 principal amount of 2019 Debentures. The balance of the funds required for the redemption of the 2019 Debentures will be funded by the Company from cash on hand.\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.
