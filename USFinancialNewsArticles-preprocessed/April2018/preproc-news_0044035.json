    "text": "323 COMMENTS PALM BEACH, Fla.—President Donald Trump said there would be a “bright path” available to North Korea if it successfully shut down its nuclear weapons program, but he vowed he would walk out of a planned meeting with the country’s leader Kim Jong Un if he felt it wasn’t yielding results.\nMr. Trump’s remarks, made at a news conference at his Florida resort Mar-a-Lago with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, came as U.S. officials have been negotiating the terms of a North Korea summit with Mr. Kim that the president said he expects to happen “in the coming weeks.” CIA Director Mike Pompeo traveled to North Korea earlier this month to meet with Mr. Kim to discuss the details and logistics.\n“If I think its a meeting that is not going to be fruitful, we’re not going to go,” Mr. Trump said. “If the meeting, when I’m there, is not fruitful, I will respectfully leave the meeting and we’ll continue what we’re doing, or whatever it is that we’ll continue. But something will happen.”\nMr. Trump said the U.S. and Japan are working together to persuade North Korea to denuclearize, praising Japanese support as “critical” to the U.S. efforts. He also thanked Chinese President Xi Jinping for his efforts in putting pressure on North Korea.\n“There is a bright path available to North Korea when it achieves denuclearization in a complete and verifiable and irreversible way,” Mr. Trump said. “It will be a great day for them. It will be a great day for the world.”\nRelated\nSeoul Sees Path for Peace Deal to Formally End Korean War U.S. Practices Wartime Evacuation of Americans From South Korea CIA Director Mike Pompeo Met North Korea’s Kim Jong Un to Discuss Summit Messrs. Trump and Abe have spent much of their two-day summit discussing the planned meeting with Mr. Kim, as well as trade tensions between Japan and the U.S.\nOn North Korea, Mr. Abe came into the summit wanting assurances that the president wouldn’t forsake Japan’s interests when he meets with Mr. Kim. Mr. Trump on Wednesday said he would work to ensure that the families of Japanese citizens who had been abducted in North Korea were “reunited as soon as possible,” a reference to one of Mr. Abe’s top priorities for the summit. “We will try to bring those folks back home, very, very hard,” Mr. Trump said.\n“I appreciate his very encouraging comment and for the families of the abductees this is a massively, powerfully encouraging comment,” Mr. Abe said of Mr. Trump’s remarks.\nJapanese leaders have worried that the U.S. will strike a deal that eliminates the threat of North Korean’s long-range nuclear missiles striking the U.S., while leaving in place shorter-range North Korean missiles that pose a threat to Japan.\nRelated Video A meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un could be a diplomatic breakthrough, but both men are nothing if not unpredictable. Mr. Abe, in his remarks at the news conference, also praised the Japanese alliance with the U.S. and said he and Mr. Trump had discussed bringing home the abductees and were “fully agreed about our direction going forward.”\nThe two leaders disagreed over the best path for trade cooperation, with Mr. Trump backing negotiations toward a bilateral trade agreement and Mr. Abe saying his country prefers the U.S. rejoining a group of a dozen countries that previously negotiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n“Unless they offer us a deal that we cannot refuse, I would not go back into TPP,” Mr. Trump said. “We are negotiating a one-on-one deal with Japan.”\nWithout committing to an explicit embrace of formal negotiations toward a bilateral free-trade agreement with the U.S., Mr. Abe said that the two countries would work on unspecified “free, fair and reciprocal” deals that benefit trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific.\nIn prepared remarks, Mr. Trump said the U.S. and Japan would “intensify” bilateral trade and investment cooperation.\nMr. Trump also defended the use of tariffs as a centerpiece of his international economic policy, and he declined to offer Japan, a key ally, an exemption to global steel and aluminum tariffs he imposed on national-security grounds.\nMr. Trump repeated concerns about the $69 billion merchandise trade deficit with Japan. The administration has sought to use the metals tariffs as a lever to win trade concessions, including with South Korea.\nAhead of the trip, White House officials had said there were no plans for Messrs. Trump and Abe to play golf.\nBut Mr. Trump had other ideas, telling reporters after Mr. Abe’s arrival on Tuesday that the pair hoped to “sneak out” and play a round.\nThat they did, spending more than four hours at the president’s club in West Palm Beach.\nMr. Trump later tweeted a picture of himself and Mr. Abe standing side-by-side, holding golf clubs in their left hands and giving a thumbs-up with their right.\n—William Mauldin in Washington contributed to this article\nWrite to Rebecca Ballhaus at Rebecca.Ballhaus@wsj.com and Peter Nicholas at peter.nicholas@wsj.com",
