    "text": "BRUSSELS (AP) â€” The European Union says that Facebook has told it that up to 2.7 million people in the 28-nation bloc may have been victim of improper data sharing involving political data-mining firm Cambridge Analytica.\nEU spokesman Christian Wigand said Friday that EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova will have a telephone call with Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg early next week to address the massive data leaks.\nThe EU and Facebook will be looking at what changes the social media giant needs to make to better protect users and how the U.S. company must adapt to new EU data protection rules.\nWigand said that EU data protection authorities will discuss over the coming days \"a strong coordinated approach\" on how to deal with the Facebook investigation.",
