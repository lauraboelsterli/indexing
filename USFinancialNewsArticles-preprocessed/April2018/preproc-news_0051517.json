    "text": "CARSON CITY, Nev., April 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via OTC PR WIRE--(OTC Pink:ZICX) – Zicix Corporation Chairman and CEO William Petty has begun negotiating for the acquisition of smart card technology (oftentimes known as “chip” technology) which provides multiple layers of security.\nWith acquisition of smart card technology, the Zicx Smart Card will include an embedded chip making it nearly impossible to duplicate a stolen card. The same technology includes e-commerce safety features providing additional fraud protection when shopping online.\nIn making today’s announcement, Mr Petty emphasized, “I want Zicix Smart Card clients to know that their cards can be safely used to preload personal cash or when receiving direct deposits; they can be totally comfortable using their cards in all financial aspects of life. They can even earn, collect and redeem points from retailer’s loyalty programs and manufacturer’s coupons.”\nAbout Zicix Corporation (ZICX:OTCMKTS US). Originally founded as a service provider to the Healthcare industry, the Zicix Corporation has recently been restructured with the intention of acquiring and developing technology applications designed for service companies in consumer, retail and other industries.\nSafe Harbor Act: This release may contain \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended and such forward-looking statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. \"Forward-looking statements\" describe future expectations, plans, results, or strategies and are generally preceded by words such as \"may,\" \"future,\" \"plan\" or \"planned,\" \"will\" or \"should,\" \"expected,\" \"anticipates,\" \"draft,\" \"eventually\" or \"projected.\" You are cautioned that such statements are subject to a multitude of risks and uncertainties that could cause future circumstances, events, or results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements, including the risks that actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, and other risks identified in a company's annual report.\nFor additional information, visit our website at www.ZicixCoupons.com , 210-332-0974\nSource:Zicix Corporation",
