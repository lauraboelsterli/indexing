Soccer Football - Championship - Aston Villa vs Leeds United - Villa Park, Birmingham, Britain - April 13, 2018 Aston Villa's Lewis Grabban celebrates scoring their first goal Action Images/Andrew Couldridge \nLewis Grabban, on loan from top-flight Bournemouth, scored the only goal in the 29th minute at Villa Park with a perfectly timed run to head in Jack Grealishâ€™s cross from the left. \nThe win guaranteed fourth-placed Villa a top-six finish as they battle Fulham and Cardiff City for the second automatic promotion place behind runaway leaders Wolverhampton Wanderers. Slideshow (6 Images) \nFulham, who host Brentford on Saturday, are second with 81 points from 42 games, a point above third-placed Cardiff, who have a game in hand and visit Norwich City, while Villa have 79 points after playing 43 of their 46 matches. \nIf Fulham fail to win then Wolves will be promoted by the time they host struggling Birmingham City on Sunday.
