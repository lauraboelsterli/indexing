    "text": "BRIDGEHAMPTON, N.Y., Bridge Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:BDGE), (the “Company”), the parent company of BNB Bank (“BNB”), today announced first quarter results for 2018.\nThe Company's first quarter 2018 financial results included:\nRecord net income for the 2018 first quarter of $12.1 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, compared to $9.2 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the 2017 first quarter. Net interest income for the 2018 first quarter increased $4.1 million over the 2017 first quarter to $34.5 million, with a net interest margin of 3.42%. Total assets of $4.5 billion at March 31, 2018, 11% higher than March 31, 2017. Loan growth of $544 million, or 20%, compared to March 31, 2017, and $99 million, or 13% annualized, from December 31, 2017. Deposit growth of $448 million, or 15%, compared to March 31, 2017, and $97 million, or 12% annualized, from December 31, 2017. Non-public, non-brokered deposit growth of $345 million, or 16%, compared to March 31, 2017, and $36 million, or 6% annualized, from December 31, 2017. Continued solid asset quality metrics and reserve coverage. All capital ratios exceed the fully phased in requirements of Basel III rules. Declared a dividend of $0.23 during the quarter.\nCommenting on the first quarter results, Kevin O’Connor, President and CEO said, “The first quarter of 2018 was a solid quarter as we resumed our trend of increasing earnings, strong credit metrics, and steady growth. While these results reflect a lower effective tax rate, pre-tax performance is positive with record quarterly pre-tax income and an expanding net interest margin. Despite closing some branches this quarter, as previously announced, we cut the ribbon on our new location in Riverhead, NY. We look forward to serving the people and businesses in this important market.”\nNet Earnings and Returns\nNet income in the 2018 first quarter was $12.1 million, or $0.61 per share, an increase of $2.9 million compared to the 2017 first quarter, driven primarily by a rise in net interest income and lower provision for taxes, partially offset by higher non-interest expense. Return on average assets and equity in the 2018 first quarter were 1.09% and 10.86%, respectively, compared to 0.92% and 8.62%, respectively, in the 2017 first quarter.\nInterest income was $41.4 million in the 2018 first quarter, an increase of $1.4 million compared to the 2017 fourth quarter, driven primarily by organic growth in loans and partially offset by a decrease in the average securities portfolio. Interest expense was $6.8 million in the 2018 first quarter, an increase of $0.4 million compared to the 2017 fourth quarter, due to an increase in average interest bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in average cost of interest bearing liabilities.\n“Competition for deposits has been heating up in all of our markets. One need only open up the newspaper to see the rates that some financial institutions are offering. BNB is competing selectively with these offerings in a prudent manner, however, our reputation for outstanding service has helped us keep our deposit costs somewhat contained,” stated Mr. O’Connor.\n“The Federal Reserve continues to raise short-term rates and although the yield curve did steepen through February, it has struggled to maintain that slope into the second quarter. We continue to focus on strategies to protect earnings and capital through the balance of 2018 and beyond,” noted Mr. O’Connor.\nProvision for loan losses was $0.8 million for the 2018 first quarter, unchanged compared to the 2017 first quarter. The Company recognized recoveries of $0.3 million in the 2018 first quarter, compared to net charge-offs of $0.1 million in the 2017 first quarter.\nFor the 2018 first quarter, non-interest income was $4.1 million, unchanged compared to the 2017 first quarter, driven primarily by lower gain on sale of Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans, partially offset by higher service charges and other fees and other operating income.\nNon-interest expense for the 2018 first quarter increased to $22.6 million from $20.3 million in the 2017 first quarter. The increase in 2018 is primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefits and other operating expenses, partially offset by lower occupancy and equipment expense.\nIncome tax expense was $3.2 million in the 2018 first quarter, a decrease of $1.1 million compared with the 2017 first quarter. The decrease reflects a lower effective tax rate in 2018 due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company estimates it will record income tax at an effective tax rate of approximately 23% for the remainder of 2018.\nBalance Sheet and Asset Quality\nTotal assets were $4.5 billion at March 31, 2018, $70.6 million higher than December 31, 2017 and $435.6 million higher than March 31, 2017. Total loans at March 31, 2018 of $3.2 billion reflect growth of $544.4 million, or 20%, over March 31, 2017. Deposits totaled $3.4 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $448.4 million, or 15%, over March 31, 2017. Demand deposits increased $136.6 million year-over-year to $1.2 billion at March 31, 2018, representing 36% of total deposits.\nAsset quality measures remained solid as non-performing assets were $6.3 million, or 0.14% of total assets, at March 31, 2018, compared to $1.3 million, or 0.03%, at March 31, 2017. Non-performing assets at March 31, 2018 includes $0.2 million of other real estate owned. Non-performing loans were $6.1 million, or 0.19% of total loans at March 31, 2018, compared to $1.3 million, or 0.05%, at March 31, 2017. Loans 30 to 89 days past due decreased $0.2 million to $4.5 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $4.7 million at March 31, 2017. Loans past due 90 days and accruing at March 31, 2018 and 2017 were comprised of acquired loans of $2.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively.\nThe allowance for loan losses increased $6.2 million to $32.8 million at March 31, 2018 from $26.6 million as of March 31, 2017. The allowance as a percentage of loans was 1.02% at March 31, 2018, unchanged compared to December 31, 2017 and 0.02% higher than March 31, 2017.\nStockholders’ equity grew $3.8 million to $433.3 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $429.5 million at March 31, 2017. The growth reflects earnings, partially offset by shareholders’ dividends and a decrease in the fair value of available for sale investment securities. Tangible book value per share increased $0.16 to $16.30 at March 31, 2018, compared to $16.14 at March 31, 2017. The Company's capital ratios exceed all fully phased in capital requirements under the Basel III rules, and the Bank remains classified as well capitalized.\nAbout Bridge Bancorp, Inc.\nBridge Bancorp, Inc. is a bank holding company engaged in commercial banking and financial services through its wholly owned subsidiary, BNB Bank, formerly known as The Bridgehampton National Bank.

A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are required to be disclosed in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in the United States. The Company’s management believes the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with a greater understanding of the Company’s operating results in addition to the results measured in accordance with GAAP. While management uses these non-GAAP measures in its analysis of the Company’s performance, this information should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results determined in accordance with GAAP, or considered to be more important than financial results determined in accordance with GAAP.
