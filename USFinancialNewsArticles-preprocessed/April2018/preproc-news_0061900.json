    "text": "DUNDALK, Ireland (Reuters) - The European Union must be prepared for the real risk that negotiations over Britain’s departure from the bloc will end without a deal, the EU’s Brexit negotiator said on Monday.\n“In the coming months of negotiations the key point is to conclude a withdrawal agreement. We are not yet there and to be clear, not only because of the Irish/Northern Ireland border,” Michel Barnier said at a conference in Ireland.\n“There is a real risk and we have to be prepared for any options, including no deal. It’s not my option.”\nReporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Alison Williams\n ",
