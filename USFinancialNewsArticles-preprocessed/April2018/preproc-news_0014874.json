    "text": "April 9, 2018 / 2:51 PM / in 24 minutes Online lender SoFi appoints Michelle Gill CFO Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Online lender Social Finance Inc on Monday named Michelle Gill its chief financial officer, as new Chief Executive Officer Anthony Noto puts together his team following a raft of top-level executive exits. \nGill, who joins from TPG Sixth Street Partners, will replace interim-CFO Steven Freiberg, effective April 30. \nThe San Francisco-based lender, known as SoFi, brought in Twitter executive Anthony Noto as chief executive after the departure of Mike Cagney. \nIn September, Cagney left following an investigation into claims that current and former employees were sexually harassed at work. \nOther senior executives who resigned over the past few months included Chief Revenue Officer Michael Tannenbaum and Chief Technology Officer June Ou. \nThe exits raised doubts about SoFiâ€™s strategy and an IPO that many investors and analysts have been expecting. \nSoFi was launched in 2011 as an online lender that primarily refinanced student loans for young, affluent borrowers and later expanded into a range of financial services. \nThe company was worth $4.3 billion as of its last round of funding in February 2017.
