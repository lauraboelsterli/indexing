    "text": "April 3, 2018 / 7:01 AM / Updated 14 minutes ago Anglo needs 90 days to inspect leak at Brazil iron ore operations Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Anglo American Plc ( AAL.L ) will need about 90 days to inspect a pipeline at its suspended Minas-Rio iron ore operation in Brazil, it said on Tuesday, after the country’s environmental regulators ordered the miner to halt operations following a leak. FILE PHOTO: The AngloAmerican logo is seen in Rusternburg, South Africa, October 5, 2015. REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko/File Photo \nAnglo halted operations after a leak was discovered on March 29 on a pipeline which carries iron ore in slurry form from the mine to an export terminal. \nIt said the leak of non-hazardous iron ore slurry was stopped within eight minutes and caused no disruption to local water supply. \nThe company said there were no injuries. \nA previous leak prompted Anglo to suspend operations from March 12 to 27 at Minas-Rio, which transports iron ore from the company’s mine and processing facility in the state of Minas Gerais to a port in the state of Rio de Janeiro.
