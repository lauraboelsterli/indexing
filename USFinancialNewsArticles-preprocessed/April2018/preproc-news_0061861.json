    "text": "FINDLAY, Ohio, April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nReported first-quarter earnings of $37 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, and income from operations of $440 million Reported record Midstream segment income from operations of $567 million, largely driven by MPLX Completed significant Galveston Bay refinery turnaround activity ahead of schedule and under budget Returned $1.55 billion of capital to shareholders, including $1.33 billion of share repurchases\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. (NYSE: MPC) today reported 2018 first-quarter earnings of $37 million, or $0.08 per diluted share. This compares with $30 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\n\"So far in 2018, we have accomplished many significant milestones,\" said Gary R. Heminger, chairman and chief executive officer. \"We successfully completed a major turnaround at our Galveston Bay refinery, organically grew our midstream footprint in the Northeast and Permian, announced a definitive agreement to acquire store locations that will expand Speedway into key growth markets, and returned over $1.5 billion of capital to our shareholders.\n\"As we continue to focus on operational excellence and maximizing our shareholders' long-term returns, we also are pleased to announce that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has named MPC a 2018 Energy Star Partner of the Year for Energy Management, recognizing our leadership in energy efficiency. We are proud to manufacture, transport and market cost-efficient energy that makes millions of people's lives better every day, never losing sight of our responsibility to operate safely and efficiently.\"\nMPC's first-quarter 2018 income from operations was $440 million, an increase of $149 million over the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year increase in first-quarter income from operations was partially offset by higher net interest and other financial costs, as well as the increased amount of net income allocated to noncontrolling interests in MPLX LP (NYSE: MPLX) resulting from the Feb. 1 dropdown and general partner/IDR exchange transactions. In addition, the effective tax rate for the quarter reflects deferred tax benefits of approximately $20 million, primarily resulting from effects of these strategic transactions.\nThe Refining and Marketing (R&M) segment reported a loss from operations of $133 million, compared with a loss from operations of $70 million in the first quarter of 2017, largely as a result of the February dropdown. This quarter, activities associated with these businesses reduced R&M segment income from operations by approximately $181 million and increased Midstream segment income from operations by a like amount. Excluding these effects, R&M results improved, driven by higher throughputs and lower direct operating costs from decreased turnaround activity, partially offset by lower product-price realizations.\nMPC remains focused on realizing the substantial advantages of its flexible and integrated refining system and enhancing margins through further investments and process improvements. During the quarter, the Garyville refinery completed the final phase of its diesel maximization project. This investment further enhances MPC's ability to benefit from the adoption of the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) low-sulfur-fuels requirements, scheduled to take effect in 2020, by increasing ultra-low-sulfur-distillate production by 5,000 barrels per day.\nThe Midstream segment, which largely reflects MPLX, reported record income from operations of $567 million, up from $309 million in the first quarter last year, driven by a strong underlying base business and the February dropdown. The partnership continues to execute on its significant organic growth plan, commissioning three new processing plants during the quarter, further expanding the partnership's earnings base.\nSpeedway contributed $95 million in segment income from operations, compared with $135 million in the same quarter last year. Results were affected by increased operating expenses, accelerated depreciation arising from technology investments, and adverse weather. In April, consistent with its growth strategy, Speedway announced its agreement to purchase 78 store locations in Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo, New York. These stores will enhance the existing network and expand Speedway's brand presence in key growth markets.\nDuring the quarter, MPC returned $1.55 billion to MPC shareholders, including $1.33 billion in share repurchases funded primarily by after-tax cash proceeds from the February dropdown.\n\"Looking forward, we are very optimistic about the opportunities for our business,\" Heminger said. \"The solid demand backdrop, favorable crude differentials, and changing dynamics of the low-sulfur-fuel market all set the stage to create meaningful benefits across MPC's integrated and diversified business model.\n\"Additionally, this morning we were excited to announce that MPC entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Andeavor (NYSE: ANDV). This transaction combines two strong, complementary companies to create a leading U.S. refining, marketing, and midstream company, building a platform that is well-positioned for long-term growth and shareholder value creation.\"\nMPC and Andeavor will hold a conference call and webcast today at 8:30 a.m. to discuss the transaction and related materials can be found on our website.\nSegment Results\nIncome from operations was $440 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $291 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31\n(In millions)\n2018\n2017\nIncome (Loss) from Operations by Segment\nRefining & Marketing\n$\n(133)\n$\n(70)\nSpeedway\n95\n135\nMidstream\n567\n309\nItems not allocated to segments:\nCorporate and other unallocated items (a)\n(88)\n(83)\nPension settlement expenses\n(1)\n—\nIncome from operations (a)\n$\n440\n$\n291\n(a)\nWe adopted Accounting Standards Update 2017-07, Retirement Benefits Presentation of Pension and Postretirement Cost, as of Jan. 1, 2018, and applied the standard retrospectively. As a result, we reclassified prior period amounts from Selling, general and administrative expenses to Net interest and other financial costs to conform to current period presentation.\nRefining & Marketing\nRefining & Marketing (R&M) segment loss from operations was $133 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with a loss from operations of $70 million in the same quarter of 2017. The decrease in segment results was primarily due to the Feb. 1, 2018, dropdown of refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services to MPLX. These businesses were reported in the Midstream segment prospectively from Feb. 1, resulting in a net reduction of $181 million to R&M segment results and a net increase to Midstream segment results of the same amount. Prior period segment results do not reflect these new businesses.\nThe change in segment results also reflects the benefits of increased refinery throughputs, lower direct operating costs and the retroactive enactment of a biodiesel blending tax credit for 2017, offset by lower product price realizations as compared with spot market reference prices. Refinery throughputs totaled 1.9 million barrels per day in first quarter 2018, an increase of almost 12 percent from the first quarter of 2017. The U.S. Gulf Coast (USGC) and Chicago LLS blended 6-3-2-1 crack spread was $7.70 per barrel in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $7.72 per barrel in the first quarter of 2017.\nSpeedway\nSpeedway segment income from operations was $95 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $135 million in the first quarter of 2017. Speedway's light product margin was 15.61 cents per gallon in the first quarter of 2018 compared with 15.66 cents per gallon in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in segment results was primarily due to higher operating expense, largely related to labor costs, and accelerated depreciation. The accelerated depreciation resulted from Speedway's upgrade of dispenser technology to provide marketing earnings enhancements and strengthen customer bank card security in advance of the required timeframe. In addition, during the quarter, multiple storms in the Northeast and Midwest markets resulted in reduced traffic at Speedway stores.\nMidstream\nMidstream segment income from operations, which primarily reflects the results of MPLX, was $567 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $309 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily due to the Feb. 1 dropdown of refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services to MPLX. Additionally, the Midstream segment benefited from higher gathered, processed and fractionated volumes resulting from new processing facilities.\nItems Not Allocated to Segments\nCorporate and other unallocated expenses were $88 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared with $83 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nStrong Financial Position and Liquidity\nOn March 31, 2018, the company had $4.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents, excluding MPLX's cash and cash equivalents of $2 million; $2.5 billion available under a revolving credit agreement; $1 billion available under a 364-day bank revolving credit facility; and full availability under its $750 million trade receivables securitization facility. During the quarter, the company completed the redemption of all of the $600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of its 2.700% senior notes due in December 2018. The company's liquidity should provide it with sufficient flexibility to meet its day-to-day operational needs and continue its balanced approach to investing in the business and returning capital to shareholders while maintaining an investment-grade credit profile.\nConference Call\nMPC's previously announced first-quarter 2018 earnings conference call and webcast, which had been scheduled for Tuesday, May 1, has been cancelled. MPC and Andeavor will hold a conference call and webcast at 8:30 a.m. EDT today to discuss the transaction. Interested parties may listen to the conference call by dialing (888) 989-4720 (confirmation number 4852094) or by visiting MPC's website at http://www.marathonpetroleum.com and clicking on the \"Marathon Petroleum Corp. and Andeavor Strategic Combination\" link. Replays of the conference call will be available on both companies' websites through Tuesday, May 15. MPC management will be available to answer questions about the earnings release at the end of today's conference call. Financial information, including the earnings release and other investor-related material, also will be available online prior to the conference call and webcast at http://ir.marathonpetroleum.com in the Quarterly Investor Packet and Earnings Capsule.\nAbout Marathon Petroleum Corporation\nMPC is the nation's second-largest refiner, with a crude oil refining capacity of approximately 1.9 million barrels per calendar day in its six-refinery system.

Segment EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities.\n(b)\nOn Feb. 1, 2018, we contributed certain refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services to MPLX. The results of these new businesses are reported in the Midstream segment prospectively from Feb. 1, resulting in a net increase of $181 million to Midstream segment results and a net decrease to Refining & Marketing segment results of the same amount in the first quarter of 2018. No effect was given to prior periods as these entities were not considered businesses prior to Feb. 1, 2018.\nSelect Financial Data (Unaudited)\n(In millions)\nMarch 31\n2018\nDec. 31\n2017\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n4,653\n$\n3,011\nMPLX debt\n11,862\n6,946\nTotal consolidated debt\n17,258\n12,946\nRedeemable noncontrolling interest\n1,000\n1,000\nEquity\n18,863\n20,828\nDebt-to-total-capital ratio (percent)\n46\n37\nShares outstanding\n467\n486\nNet cash provided by (used in) operations (quarter ended)\n$\n(137)\n$\n2,745\nReconciliation of Refining & Marketing Margin to Refining & Marketing Income (Loss) from Operations\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31\n(In millions)\n2018\n2017\nRefining & Marketing loss from operations\n$\n(133)\n$\n(70)\nPlus (Less):\nRefinery direct operating costs (a)\n1,081\n1,202\nRefinery depreciation and amortization\n236\n251\nOther:\nOperating expenses (a)(b)\n722\n456\nSegment (income) expense, net (a)\n(108)\n(64)\nDepreciation and amortization\n16\n16\nRefining & Marketing margin (c)\n$\n1,814\n$\n1,791\n(a)\nExcludes depreciation and amortization.\n(b)\nIncludes fees paid to MPLX for various midstream services.\n(c)\nRefining & Marketing margin is defined as sales revenue less cost of refinery inputs and purchased products, excluding any LCM inventory market adjustment.
