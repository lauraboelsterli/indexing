    "text": " Twitter said on Tuesday it is updating its privacy policy to allow users to view information stored by the microblogging service relating to their account, as it prepares to comply with upcoming European data privacy laws.\nTech companies have long been scrutinized for how they protect their customers’ data and Facebook is currently embroiled in a huge scandal where millions of users’ data were improperly accessed by a political consultancy.\nThe European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation comes into effect on May 25 and is the biggest shake-up of privacy rules since the birth of the internet.
