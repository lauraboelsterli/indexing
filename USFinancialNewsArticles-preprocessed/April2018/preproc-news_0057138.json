LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK (As reported by NewsRise) • The SGX Nifty nearest-month futures were trading at 10,549.50, down 0.2 percent from its previous close. • The Indian rupee is likely to edge lower against the dollar today as the U.S. currency, supported by rising Treasury yields, has risen to its highest level since mid-January. • Indian government bonds will likely open lower ahead of a fresh supply of debt today, while higher U.S. Treasury yields and falling rupee continue to weigh on sentiment. Yield on the benchmark 7.17 percent 2028 bond is likely to trade in a 7.72 percent-7.78 percent band till the auction results today. GLOBAL MARKETS • Wall Street limped into positive territory on Wednesday on optimism over a spate of upbeat earnings that was nearly offset by jitters over rising U.S. bond yields and corporate costs. • Asian stocks rose as robust corporate earnings helped Wall Street quell concerns about the surge in U.S. bond yields, while the dollar hovered near 3-1/2-month highs against a basket of currencies. • The dollar traded near a 3-1/2 month high against a basket of currencies, bolstered by higher U.S. Treasury yields, led by the 10-year benchmark breaching the 3 percent threshold this week for the first time in four years. • The benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year yield edged above 3 percent on Wednesday as jitters about growing federal borrowing spurred more selling in the U.S. government bonds, paving the path for it to visit levels not seen since July 2011. • Oil prices rose, supported by an expectation that the United States will re-impose sanctions against Iran, a decline in output in Venezuela and ongoing strong demand. • Gold prices stayed close to five-week lows hit in the previous session, pressured by a stronger dollar, which hovered near more than three-month highs, and a rise in U.S. Treasury yields.
