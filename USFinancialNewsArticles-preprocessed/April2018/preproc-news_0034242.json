    "text": "* Futures up: Dow 0.63 pct, S&P 0.61 pct, Nasdaq 0.62 pct\nBy Sruthi Shankar\nApril 16 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Monday as investors bet the weekend’s U.S.-led missile attack on Syria would not escalate into a broader conflict.\nThe focus was back on earnings, with Bank of America reporting a 34 percent rise in quarterly profit. Its shares were up 0.84 percent in premarket trading.\nJPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup kicked off the quarterly earnings season on Friday, although their performances failed to excite investors.\nThomson Reuters data is expecting S&P 500 companies to report an 18.6 percent rise in profits in the first quarter, their biggest rise in seven years.\nMany traders say that reactions to results could be muted as market participants have already priced in benefits from corporate tax cuts, reflected in the stock market’s strong rally in 2017 and early 2018.\nAt 7:01 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 154 points, or 0.63 percent. S&P 500 e-minis rose 16.25 points, or 0.61 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis gained 41.5 points, or 0.62 percent.\nOn Saturday, the United States, France and Britain launched 105 missiles on Syria in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack.\nThe countries said the missile strikes targeted Syria’s chemical weapons capabilities and were not aimed at toppling Syrian President Bashar al-Assad or intervening in the civil war.\nPresident Donald Trump tweeted “mission accomplished” after the attack, underlining expectations that Western action would be limited.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin warned that further Western attacks on Syria would bring chaos to world affairs, as Washington prepared to increase pressure on Russia with new economic sanctions.\nRetail sales data for March is scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. ET. Sales are expected to have increased 0.4 percent after falling for the previous three months that prompted analysts to downgrade their first-quarter economic growth forecasts.\nAmong other stocks, General Electric shares were down more than 1 percent after the company said it took a $4.24 billion equity charge and reduced earnings for the last two years by 30 cents a share.\nNetflix shares rose 1.44 percent ahead of its results expected after market close on Monday.
