(HMN or the Company) (NASDAQ:HMNF), the $722 million holding company for Home Federal Savings Bank (the Bank), today reported net income of $1.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $0.2 million compared to net income of $1.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.29, an increase of $0.04 from diluted earnings per share of $0.25 for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in net income between the periods was due primarily to the $0.4 million increase in net interest income and a $0.2 million decrease in income tax expense as a result of the reduced federal corporate income tax rate for 2018. These increases in net income were partially offset by a $0.2 million increase in the provision for loan losses between the periods due to loan growth, a $0.3 million increase in other non-interest expenses due primarily to an increase in the losses incurred on deposit accounts and an increase in charitable contributions, and a $0.1 million decrease on the gain on sale of loans due to a decrease in single family loan sales between the periods.\nPresident’s Statement\n“We continue to be encouraged by the growth in our loan portfolio and the related increase in net interest income,” said Home Federal Savings Bank President and Chief Executive Officer, Bradley Krehbiel. “We intend to continue to focus our efforts on improving the Bank’s core operating results by prudently growing the asset size of the Bank while maintaining the credit quality of our loan portfolio.”\nFirst Quarter Results\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income was $6.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $0.4 million, or 7.0%, compared to $6.3 million for the first quarter of 2017. Interest income was $7.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $0.5 million, or 7.5%, from $6.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. Interest income increased between the periods primarily because of an increase in the average interest-earning assets and a change in the composition of the average interest-earning assets held, which resulted in an increase in the average yields earned between the periods. While the average interest-earning assets increased $37.6 million between the periods, the average interest-earning assets held in higher yielding loans increased $32.4 million and the amount of average interest-earning assets held in lower yielding cash and investments increased $5.2 million between the periods. The increase in the average outstanding loans between the periods was primarily the result of an increase in the commercial loan portfolio, which occurred because of a reduction in loan payoffs between the periods. The average yield earned on interest-earning assets was 4.23% for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 7 basis points from 4.16% for the first quarter of 2017.\nInterest expense was $0.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $0.1 million, or 15.5%, compared to $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. The average interest rate paid on non-interest and interest-bearing liabilities was 0.31% for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 3 basis points from 0.28% for the first quarter of 2017. The average interest rate paid increased between the periods due to an increase in the rates paid on certain money market accounts and certificates of deposit that was partially offset by a change in the composition of the average non-interest and interest-bearing liabilities held between the periods. While the average non-interest and interest-bearing liabilities increased $29.3 million between the periods, the average amount held in lower rate checking, savings, and money market accounts decreased $10.4 million, while the average amount held in higher rate premium money market accounts increased $36.6 million and the average amount held in higher rate borrowings and certificates of deposit increased $3.1 million between the periods. Net interest margin (net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets) for the first quarter of 2018 was 3.95%, an increase of 4 basis points, compared to 3.91% for the first quarter of 2017.\nA summary of the Company’s net interest margin for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nFor the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 (Dollars in thousands) Average\nOutstanding\nBalance Interest\nEarned/\nPaid Yield/\nRate Average\nOutstanding\nBalance Interest\nEarned/\nPaid Yield/\nRate Interest-earning assets: Securities available for sale $ 78,274 314 1.63 % $ 76,197 275 1.46 % Loans held for sale 1,063 11 4.20 1,656 18 4.41 Mortgage loans, net 113,612 1,122 4.01 110,064 1,111 4.09 Commercial loans, net 400,488 4,768 4.83 371,153 4,385 4.79 Consumer loans, net 72,390 877 4.91 72,255 846 4.75 Cash equivalents 20,116 61 1.23 17,036 23 0.55 Federal Home Loan Bank stock 842 5 2.41 786 2 1.03 Total interest-earning assets 686,785 7,158 4.23 649,147 6,660 4.16 Interest-bearing liabilities and non-interest bearing deposits: Checking 89,644 10 0.05 92,063 20 0.09 Savings 77,174 15 0.08 75,273 15 0.08 Money market 190,413 186 0.40 162,540 105 0.26 Certificates 111,702 257 0.93 101,950 152 0.60 Advances and other borrowings 569 2 1.43 7,399 115 6.30 Total interest-bearing liabilities 469,502 439,225 Non-interest checking 153,266 154,407 Other non-interest bearing escrow deposits 1,541 1,339 Total interest-bearing liabilities and non-interest bearing deposits $ 624,309 470 0.31 $ 594,971 407 0.28 Net interest income $ 6,688 $ 6,253 Net interest rate spread 3.92 % 3.88 % Net interest margin 3.95 % 3.91 % Provision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses was ($0.1 million) for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $0.2 million compared to the provision for loan losses of ($0.3 million) for the first quarter of 2017. The provision increased in the first quarter of 2018 primarily because there were fewer credit rating upgrades on commercial loans in the first quarter of 2018 when compared to the first quarter of 2017. Total non-performing assets were $4.0 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of $0.2 million, or 5.99%, from $3.8 million at December 31, 2017. Non-performing loans increased $152,000 and foreclosed and repossessed assets increased $74,000 during the first quarter of 2018.\nA reconciliation of the Company’s allowance for loan losses for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\n(Dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 Balance at January 1, $ $9,311 9,903 Provision (125 ) (270 ) Charge offs: Consumer (68 ) (201 ) Single family (24 ) 0 Recoveries 35 158 Balance at March 31, $ $9,129 9,590 General allowance $ $8,181 8,792 Specific allowance 948 798 $ $9,129 9,590 The following table summarizes the amounts and categories of non-performing assets in the Bank’s portfolio and loan delinquency information as of the end of the two most recently completed quarters.\nMarch 31, December 31, (Dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 Non‑performing loans: Single family real estate $ 838 $ 949 Commercial real estate 1,557 1,364 Consumer 632 553 Commercial business 269 278 Total 3,296 3,144 Foreclosed and repossessed assets: Single family real estate 74 0 Commercial real estate 627 627 Total non‑performing assets $ 3,997 $ 3,771 Total as a percentage of total assets 0.55 % 0.52 % Total non‑performing loans $ 3,296 $ 3,144 Total as a percentage of total loans receivable, net 0.56 % 0.54 % Allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans 276.94 % 296.11 % Delinquency data: Delinquencies (1) 30+ days $ 1,280 $ 1,789 90+ days 0 0 Delinquencies as a percentage of loan and lease portfolio (1) 30+ days 0.21 % 0.30 % 90+ days 0.00 % 0.00 % (1) Excludes non-accrual loans.\nNon-Interest Income and Expense\nNon-interest income was $1.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 5.6%, from $1.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. Gain on sales of loans decreased $0.1 million between the periods primarily because of a decrease in the gains recognized on the sale of single family loans due to a decrease in loan origination and sales. Fees and service charges decreased $0.1 million between the periods due primarily to a decrease in overdraft fees. These decreases in non-interest income were partially offset by a slight increase in other income related to the sale of uninsured investment products between the periods.\nNon-interest expense was $6.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $0.3 million, or 3.3%, from $6.3 million for the first quarter of 2017. Other non-interest expenses increased $0.3 million due primarily to an increase in the losses incurred on deposit accounts and an increase in charitable contributions. Occupancy and equipment expense increased $0.1 million between the periods due to an increase in non-capitalized equipment purchases. These increases in non-interest expense were partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in compensation and benefits expense due primarily to a decrease in the number of employees between the periods.\nIncome tax expense was $0.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of $0.2 million from $0.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in income tax expense between the periods is primarily the result of a decrease in the federal corporate income tax rate due to the tax law changes that were enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nReturn on Assets and Equity\nReturn on average assets (annualized) for the first quarter of 2018 was 0.82%, compared to 0.73% for the first quarter of 2017. Return on average equity (annualized) was 7.07% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 6.35% for the first quarter of 2017. Book value per common share at March 31, 2018 was $18.22, compared to $17.22 at March 31, 2017.\nGeneral Information\nHMN Financial, Inc. and the Bank are headquartered in Rochester, Minnesota.
