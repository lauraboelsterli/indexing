    "text": "EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Britain’s defense capabilities must evolve to keep step with the growing threat posed by Russia, Defense Minister Gavin Williamson said, as a standoff between Moscow and the West over the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter deepened.\nBritain's Secretary of State for Defence Gavin Williamson arrives in Downing Street in London, Britain, February 8, 2018. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls “(Russian President Vladimir) Putin is using growing hybrid capabilities to subvert, undermine, and influence countries around the world,” Williamson said in a column in Sunday’s edition of Britain’s Sunday Telegraph.\n“It’s vital for UK defense to keep evolving to meet the threats of tomorrow to keep our country safe and protect the hard-earned freedoms and way of life we enjoy today.”\nReporting by Elisabeth O'Leary; Editing by Sandra Maler\n ",
