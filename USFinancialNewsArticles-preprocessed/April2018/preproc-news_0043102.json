(NASDAQ:WERN), one of the nation’s largest transportation and logistics companies, reported improved revenues and earnings for the first 2018. Earnings per diluted share were $0.38 for first quarter 2018 compared to earnings per diluted share of $0.22 for first quarter 2017.\nFirst quarter 2018 freight demand in our One-Way Truckload fleet was much stronger than normal for first quarter. Demand was consistently strong each month of first quarter 2018 and was broad-based geographically. Freight volumes thus far in April 2018 continue to be much stronger than normal.\nAverage revenues per tractor per week increased 6.8% in first quarter 2018 compared to first quarter 2017 due to a 10.0% increase in average revenues per total mile, partially offset by a 2.9% decrease in average miles per truck. The increase in average revenues per total mile was due primarily to higher contractual rates, more freight choices with higher rates and lane mix changes.\nOur trucks and drivers experienced more severe weather than normal in first quarter 2018 that was caused by multiple winter storms and colder temperatures in the Eastern and Midwest regions of the U.S. compared to a relatively mild winter in first quarter 2017. We estimate the more challenging weather conditions reduced earnings by three cents per diluted share in first quarter 2018 compared to first quarter 2017. This included cost increases for higher insurance and claims due to an increase in event frequency and severity; higher equipment maintenance costs for towing, road calls, jump starts and other weather-related maintenance; more workers’ compensation claims related to weather incidents; higher fuel costs due to increased truck idling; and reduced revenue due to temporary closures of our driver training schools for severe weather.\nIn first quarter 2018, we averaged 7,427 trucks in service in the Truckload Transportation Services (Truckload) segment and 43 intermodal drayage trucks in the Werner Logistics segment. We ended first quarter 2018 with 7,385 trucks in the Truckload segment, a year-over-year increase of 205 trucks and a sequential decrease of 50 trucks. Our Dedicated unit ended first quarter 2018 with 4,030 trucks (or 55% of our total Truckload segment fleet) compared to 3,710 trucks at the end of first quarter 2017. During first quarter 2018, we added several new Dedicated fleets.\nWe are continuing to invest in newer trucks and trailers in 2018 to improve our driver experience, raise operational efficiency and more effectively manage our maintenance, safety and fuel costs. The average age of our truck fleet remains low by industry standards and was 1.9 years as of March 31, 2018. Net capital expenditures in first quarter 2018 were $55.5 million compared to $14.6 million in first quarter 2017. We expect net capital expenditures for 2018 to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million. This range allows for increased investment in our tractor and trailer fleet as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. It reflects increased confidence in potential growth due to a strong Dedicated pipeline and overall market demand. Tractor allocations between fleets are made based on relative returns, and growth is dependent on improved margins and continued success attracting quality drivers in a difficult market.\nThe driver recruiting market is increasingly challenging. Several ongoing market factors persist including a declining number of, and increased competition for, driver training school graduates, an historically low national unemployment rate, aging truck driver demographics and increased truck safety regulations including the regulation changes for electronic logging devices. We continue to take significant actions to strengthen our driver recruiting and retention to make Werner a preferred choice for the best drivers, including raising driver pay, maintaining a new truck and trailer fleet, purchasing best-in-class safety and training features for all new trucks, investing in our driver training school network and collaborating with customers to improve or eliminate unproductive freight. These efforts continue to have positive results on our driver turnover with our first quarter 2018 driver turnover percentage being one of the lowest in the last 20 years.\nDue to growth in company trucks and a decline in independent contractor trucks in first quarter 2018 compared to first quarter 2017, both company truck miles increased and independent contractor miles decreased by approximately 5 million miles. This caused a shift in expense from rent and purchased transportation expense to most other operating expense categories in first quarter 2018 compared to first quarter 2017.\nGains on sales of assets were $2.7 million in first quarter 2018. This compares to gains on sales of assets of $1.4 million in first quarter 2017. In first quarter 2018, we sold slightly more trucks and fewer trailers than in first quarter 2017. We realized higher average gains per truck and higher average gains per trailer in first quarter 2018 compared to first quarter 2017. The used truck pricing market remained difficult but is beginning to show signs of improvement. Gains on sales of assets are reflected as a reduction of Other Operating Expenses in our income statement. First quarter 2017 included an increase in depreciation expense of $2.6 million due to a reduction in the estimated residual values of certain trucks as a result of the weak used truck market.\nDiesel fuel prices were 39 cents per gallon higher in first quarter 2018 than in first quarter 2017 and were 8 cents per gallon higher than in fourth quarter 2017. For the first 19 days of April 2018, the average diesel fuel price per gallon was 43 cents higher than the average diesel fuel price per gallon in the same period of 2017 and 55 cents higher than in second quarter 2017. The components of our total fuel cost consist of and are recorded in our income statement as follows: (i) Fuel (fuel expense for company trucks excluding federal and state fuel taxes); (ii) Taxes and Licenses (federal and state fuel taxes); and (iii) Rent and Purchased Transportation (fuel component of our independent contractor costs, including the base cost of fuel and additional fuel surcharge reimbursement for costs exceeding the fuel base).\nOur effective income tax rate in first quarter 2018 of 21.3% was lower than our expected range of 25% to 26% due to the benefit of discrete federal and state income tax items. We expect our effective income tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 26% going forward.\nTo provide shippers with additional sources of managed capacity and network analysis, we continue to develop our non-asset based Werner Logistics segment. Werner Logistics includes Brokerage, Freight Management, Intermodal, Werner Global Logistics (International) and Werner Final Mile.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\n2017\nWerner Logistics (amounts in thousands) $ % $ % Operating revenues $ 117,420 100.0 $ 99,853 100.0 Rent and purchased transportation expense 100,276 85.4 84,317 84.4 Gross margin 17,144 14.6 15,536 15.6 Other operating expenses 14,387 12.3 12,487 12.5 Operating income $ 2,757 2.3 $ 3,049 3.1 In first quarter 2018, Werner Logistics revenues increased $17.6 million, or 18%, and operating income dollars decreased $0.3 million, or 10%, compared to first quarter 2017. The Werner Logistics gross margin percentage in first quarter 2018 of 14.6% decreased 96 basis points compared to the gross margin percentage of 15.6% in first quarter 2017. The Werner Logistics operating income percentage in first quarter 2018 of 2.3% decreased 71 basis points from first quarter 2017 of 3.1%. Tighter carrier capacity in first quarter 2018 compared to first quarter 2017 resulted in higher purchased transportation costs for the Company’s predominately contractual logistics business causing the lower gross margin and operating income percentages.\nIn first quarter 2018, Werner Logistics achieved 36.3% revenue growth year over year in our truck brokerage solution, including transactional brokerage. Our freight management and international solutions had revenue growth, while intermodal had slightly lower revenues due to a planned comprehensive yield initiative that led to a volume decline. The Werner Logistics operating income percentage improved sequentially the last two quarters, from 1.3% in third quarter 2017 to 1.8% in fourth quarter 2017 to 2.3% in first quarter 2018. We continue to see strong customer acceptance of the value of the Werner Logistics portfolio of service offerings, particularly as the market strengthens and shippers tend to consolidate their logistics business with the stability of larger asset-backed logistics providers. Achieving contractual rate increases in 2018 to recoup rising costs of third-party capacity is a focus for Werner Logistics.\nComparisons of the operating ratios for the Truckload segment (net of fuel surcharge revenues of $60.7 million and $48.0 million in first quarters 2018 and 2017, respectively) and the Werner Logistics segment are shown below.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, Operating Ratios 2018 2017 Difference Truckload Transportation Services 91.0 % 93.0 % (2.0 )% Werner Logistics 97.7 % 96.9 % 0.8 % Fluctuating fuel prices and fuel surcharge revenues impact the total company operating ratio and the Truckload segment’s operating ratio when fuel surcharges are reported on a gross basis as revenues versus netting against fuel expenses. Eliminating fuel surcharge revenues, which are generally a more volatile source of revenue, provides a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period to period. The Truckload segment’s operating ratios for first quarter 2018 and first quarter 2017 are 92.3% and 93.9%, respectively, when fuel surcharge revenues are reported as revenues instead of a reduction of operating expenses.\nOur financial position remains strong. As of March 31, 2018, we had $75 million of debt outstanding and over $1.2 billion of stockholders’ equity.\nINCOME STATEMENT (Unaudited) (In thousands, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 $ % $ % Operating revenues $ 562,684 100.0 $ 501,221 100.0 Operating expenses: Salaries, wages and benefits 182,794 32.5 160,839 32.1 Fuel 59,032 10.5 45,156 9.0 Supplies and maintenance 45,739 8.1 38,232 7.6 Taxes and licenses 22,493 4.0 20,786 4.2 Insurance and claims 21,158 3.8 19,840 4.0 Depreciation 55,506 9.9 55,336 11.0 Rent and purchased transportation 135,922 24.2 126,425 25.2 Communications and utilities 4,107 0.7 4,072 0.8 Other 818 0.1 4,563 0.9 Total operating expenses 527,569 93.8 475,249 94.8 Operating income 35,115 6.2 25,972 5.2 Other expense (income): Interest expense 482 0.1 776 0.2 Interest income (740 ) (0.1 ) (914 ) (0.2 ) Other 53 — 53 — Total other expense (income) (205 ) — (85 ) — Income before income taxes 35,320 6.2 26,057 5.2 Income tax expense (benefit) 7,513 1.3 10,038 2.0 Net income $ 27,807 4.9 $ 16,019 3.2 Diluted shares outstanding 72,671 72,447 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.38 $ 0.22\nSEGMENT INFORMATION (Unaudited) (In thousands) Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Revenues Truckload Transportation Services $ 431,556 $ 385,003 Werner Logistics 117,420 99,853 Other (1) 13,259 16,110 Corporate 907 422 Subtotal 563,142 501,388 Inter-segment eliminations (2) (458 ) (167 ) Total $ 562,684 $ 501,221 Operating Income Truckload Transportation Services $ 33,422 $ 23,466 Werner Logistics 2,757 3,049 Other (1) (386 ) 145 Corporate (678 ) (688 ) Total $ 35,115 $ 25,972 (1) Other includes our driver training schools, transportation-related activities such as third-party equipment maintenance and equipment leasing, and other business activities.
