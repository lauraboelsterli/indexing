    "text": "BIRMINGHAM, Ala., April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Infinity Property and Casualty Corporation (NASDAQ: IPCC) today reported results for the three months ended March 31, 2018:\nThree months ended March 31,\n(in millions, except per share amounts and ratios)\n2018\n2017\nChange\n(as adjusted) (1)\nGross written premium (2)\n$421.6\n$370.7\n13.7%\nRevenues\n$388.8\n$377.6\n3.0%\nNet earnings\n$20.1\n$10.5\n91.1%\nNet earnings per diluted share\n$1.82\n$0.94\n93.6%\nNet earnings excluding realized gains (2)\n$22.3\n$10.2\n119.3%\nNet earnings excluding realized gains per diluted share (2)\n$2.03\n$0.91\n123.1%\nUnderwriting income (2)\n$26.3\n$11.5\n128.9%\nCombined ratio (3)\n92.6%\n96.6%\n(4.0) pts\nReturn on equity (4)\n11.2%\n6.0%\n5.2 pts\nReturn on equity excluding realized gains (2) (4)\n12.5%\n5.8%\n6.7 pts\nBook value per share\n$65.61\n$63.80\n2.8 %\nDebt to total capital\n27.7%\n28.1%\n(0.4) pt\nDebt to tangible capital (2)\n30.0%\n30.4%\n(0.4) pt\nNotes:\n(1)\n2017 has been adjusted for the retrospective adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\n(2)\nMeasures used in this release that are not based on generally accepted accounting principles (\"non-GAAP\") are defined at the end of this release and reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure.\n(3)\nDuring the first quarter of 2017, a $3.8 million adjustment was made to written and earned premium for premium to be refunded to policyholders in California. Excluding the adjustment, the GAAP combined ratio for the first quarter of 2017 would have been 95.6%.\n(4)\nAnnualized\nColumns throughout may not foot due to rounding.\nNet earnings per diluted share increased 93.6% in the first three months of 2018 compared with the first three months of 2017, primarily due to a decrease in the accident year combined ratio from 98.5% at March 31, 2017, to 95.1% at March 31, 2018, as higher average earned premiums offset relatively flat loss cost trends.\nGross written premium grew 13.7% compared with the same period of 2017. Growth in California, Texas and Commercial Auto, primarily as a result of higher average premium, was offset by a decline in Florida.\nMerger with Kemper Corporation\nOn February 13, 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") with Kemper Corporation, a Delaware corporation (\"Kemper\") and Vulcan Sub, Inc., an Ohio corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Kemper (\"Kemper Merger Sub\"). The Company expects the closing of the Merger to occur in the third quarter of 2018. The merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including, among others, (i) adoption by Infinity shareholders of the Merger Agreement, (ii) approval by Kemper stockholders of the issuance of Kemper common stock in connection with the merger, (iii) the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, (iv) the absence of any effective order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal restraint prohibiting or preventing the consummation of the merger, and (v) other closing conditions.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains certain \"forward-looking statements\" which anticipate results based on our estimates, assumptions and plans that are subject to uncertainty. These statements are made subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Infinity undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any of the forward-looking statements. For a more detailed discussion of some of the foregoing risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, see Infinity's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

insurance business. The Company believes that net earnings excluding realized gains provides investors a valuable measure of the performance without being obscured by the net effect of realized capital gains and losses, which can be volatile on a quarterly basis. Net earnings is the most comparable GAAP measure.\nUnderwriting income measures the insurer's profit on insurance sales after all losses and expenses have been paid and is calculated by deducting losses and loss adjustment expenses and commissions and other underwriting expenses from earned premium. Management uses underwriting income to measure the success of its pricing and underwriting strategies. It is useful for investors to evaluate the components of our profitability separately from investments. Net earnings is the most comparable GAAP measure.\nBelow is a schedule that reconciles operating earnings and underwriting income to net earnings:\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n(in millions, except EPS)\n(as adjusted)\nNet earnings\n$20.1\n$10.5\nLess:\nRealized (losses) gains on investments, pre-tax\n(2.8)\n0.5\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes\n0.6\n(0.2)\nRealized (losses) gains on investments, net of tax\n(2.2)\n0.3\nNet earnings excluding realized gains, after-tax\n22.3\n10.2\nLess: Provision for income taxes\n(5.4)\n(4.2)\nNet earnings excluding realized gains, pre-tax\n27.8\n14.4\nLess:\nNet investment income\n9.8\n8.7\nOther income\n0.4\n0.3\nInterest expense\n(3.5)\n(3.5)\nCorporate general and administrative expenses\n(4.7)\n(2.3)\nOther expenses\n(0.5)\n(0.3)\nUnderwriting income\n26.3\n11.5\nNet earnings per diluted share\n$1.82\n$0.94\nLess: Realized (losses) gains on investments, net of tax\n(0.21)\n0.03\nNet earnings excluding realized gains per diluted share\n$2.03\n$0.91\nGross written premium is the amount of premium charged for policies issued during a fiscal period (including assumed premium). Management uses gross written premium as a measure of production levels. Earned premium is the most comparable GAAP measure.\nBelow is a schedule that reconciles gross written premium to earned premium:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31,\n(in millions)\n2018\n2017\nEarned premium\n$354.0\n$341.4\nLess: Change in unearned premium\n(63.9)\n(26.7)\nNet written premium\n417.9\n368.1\nLess: Ceded reinsurance\n(3.7)\n(2.6)\nGross written premium\n$421.6\n$370.7\nTangible capital is defined as total capital (face value of long-term debt plus total shareholders' equity) less intangible assets. Infinity reports this non-GAAP measure because it is a measure often used by debt-holders and rating agencies when evaluating financial leverage. Total capital is the most comparable GAAP measure.\nBelow is a schedule that reconciles tangible capital to total capital:\n(in millions)\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\n(as adjusted)\nTotal capital\n$992.9\n$980.2\nLess: Goodwill\n75.3\n$75.3\nTangible capital\n$917.6\n$904.9\nInfinity also makes available an investor supplement on its website.
