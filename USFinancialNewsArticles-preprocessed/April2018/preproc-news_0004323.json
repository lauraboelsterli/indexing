    "text": "Effective April 30, 2018 Raul Henriquez will remain Chairman of the Board\nMIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Insigneo announced today that Daniel de Ontanon will join the company as CEO, effective April 30, 2018. Raul Henriquez, who has served as Insigneo’s (and its predecessor companies’) CEO since 1985, will continue in his role of Chairman of the Board.\nHeadquartered in Miami, Insigneo is one of the leading U.S.-based independent financial firms with a focus on global customers. It has a presence in five Latin American countries and manages more than US$8.5 billion in customer assets.\n“Daniel has earned a stellar reputation for his leadership and extensive global wealth management experience, and he has a clear vision to take Insigneo to the next level—all of which are critical ingredients for our company’s continued growth,” said Henriquez, chairman of Insigneo. “We are confident Daniel is the right executive to lead Insigneo in its next phase of strategic expansion and growth.\"\nAn industry veteran, de Ontanon has more than 20 years of experience with financial services, leading global wealth management firms with a focus on the Latin America region—Insigneo’s key market. Most recently, he served as head of Americas Investment Services at Citi Private Bank (CPB), where he was responsible for the region’s investment teams.\nDe Ontanon was a key catalyst in turning CPB Latin America into one of the largest wealth managers for ultra high net worth (UHNW) clients in the region, doubling CPB Latin America’s investment revenues and driving double-digit growth on the North American region over a two-year period. He also fostered the creation of one of the top investment platforms for UHNW clients in the region.\nBefore that, he held various leadership roles, including head of sales for Citibank's International Personal Banking for the Latin America Region and President of Citi International Financial Services. He also held positions at UBS International and Morgan Stanley.\nDe Ontanon graduated from the University of Puerto Rico, San Juan, and holds Series 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 23, 63 and 65 securities licenses.\n“I’m honored to have been offered the challenge of leading Insigneo, and I am ready to build on the company’s vision to deliver its unique international wealth management offering, always focused on a superior advisor and client experience,” said de Ontanon. “I’m committed to continuing Insigneo’s significant growth, seeking to build a stellar team and provide innovative investment solutions.\"\nAbout Insigneo\nInsigneo is the result of the integration of the values, culture, and collective experience of several companies – Global Investor Services, HB Asset Management, Alpha Capital, Hencorp Wealth Advisors, and Northeast Securities. With over $8.5 billion USD under management and 130 Financial Advisors serving more than 15,000 clients primarily in Latin America, Insigneo is fully committed to our client’s success and completely focused on creating a superior experience in wealth management. Under this vision, we have integrated an executive board with experienced industry leaders to strengthen the company’s commitment to its future success.
