    "text": "HAMBURG, April 11 (Reuters) - Emirates will exercise purchasing rights for 16 Airbus A380 jets “sooner rather than later,” the airline’s president said on Wednesday.\nEmirates signed a preliminary agreement in January for 20 A380s and options for an additional 16. It has since finalised the agreement for the 20 A380 jets.\nThe Middle East airline is still deciding which engines it will purchase for those A380s, President Tim Clark told reporters in Hamburg.
