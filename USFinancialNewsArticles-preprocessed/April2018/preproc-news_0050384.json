    "text": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Otus, a Chicago-based education technology platform provider for teachers, administrators, students and parents, today announced Eric Patnoudes as its new Director of Strategic Initiatives. Eric, who officially joined the company last week, will oversee developing partnerships in the school technology sales process.\nIn his four years as a K-12 Education Strategist at CDW, the largest reseller of devices in the United States, Eric ensured schools effectively adopted CDW’s technology and implemented a strategy to maximize student performance. Prior to that, he was an instructional technologist and a special education teacher at Joliet Township High School outside of Chicago. He holds a Master of Education (M.Ed) degree from the University of Illinois, with an emphasis on Curriculum, Technology and Education Reform.\n“Eric has a strong track record of building and implementing edtech strategy, and is a thought leader in education,” said Otus COO Keith Westman. “We’re thrilled to have him on our team as we continue to grow with our partners and our school districts across the country.”\n“I was drawn to Otus because we share a the viewpoint that, while technology can empower teachers, real progress comes from teachers who know how to effectively utilize that technology,\" said Patnoudes. “I’m looking forward to helping schools take full advantage of Otus’ industry-leading platform.”\nOtus, which is free for students and teachers, was recently named “Best Learning Analytics Solution” by EdTech Digest. The company also just announced a Grading Services Partnership with Infinite Campus , a leading student information system.\nAbout Otus\nOtus is a Chicago-based education technology company that has developed an innovative school operating system for K-12 classrooms, schools, and districts.
