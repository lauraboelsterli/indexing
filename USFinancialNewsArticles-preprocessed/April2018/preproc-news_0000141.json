FILE PHOTO: The Allergan logo is seen in this photo illustration in Singapore November 23, 2015. REUTERS/Thomas White/File Photo \nA sale, which would likely attract interest from private equity firms, could value the business at more than $5 billion, according to the Bloomberg report. \nThe women’s health unit, which makes oral contraceptive pills to menopause treatment, raked in $1.04 billion sales in 2017. \nA decision on whether to pursue a sale hasn’t been made and the Botox maker could choose to keep the business, Bloomberg reported. An Allergan spokeswoman declined to comment. \nThe company’s shares closed at $162.27, and have fallen about 34 percent in the last twelve months.
