    "text": "April 20, 2018 / 12:38 PM / Updated 33 minutes ago SunTrust says ex-employee may have leaked information on 1.5 mln clients Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nApril 20 (Reuters) - SunTrust Banks Inc on Friday said a former employee may have attempted to download information on nearly 1.5 million clients and share the information with a criminal third-party. \nThe company said it believes the information included names and account balances, but it did not include personally identifiable information, such as social security numbers, account numbers, pins, user IDs, passwords or driverâ€™s license numbers. \nNo significant fraudulent activity has been identified, Chief Executive Officer William Rogers said on a post earnings call with analysts. \nThe bank also said that as of last week, it believed the stolen information had not left SunTrust.
