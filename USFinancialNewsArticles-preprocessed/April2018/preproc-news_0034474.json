Larger furniture at least would be for home delivery only.\nIKEA opened a first, bigger downtown store in 2014, in Hamburg, Germany. Planned new downtown locations include London’s Greenwich borough and Copenhagen, in 2019 and 2020 respectively.\nIKEA has also started trying other, smaller city-centre formats, such as a kitchen showroom in Stockholm and a Madrid bedroom showroom and accessories store. It is also rolling out order and pickup points.\nFrance is IKEA Group’s third-biggest market with 33 stores and sales of 2.7 billion euros ($3.33 billion) in its last fiscal year.\nIKEA, the world’s biggest home furnishing brand, operates through a franchise system. IKEA Group, with 363 stores, is the main franchisor to brand owner Inter IKEA.\n$1 = 0.8102 euros Reporting by Anna Ringstrom; editing by Niklas Pollard and Adrian Croft\n ",
