AWS lets developers do more and be nimbler, and it continues to get even better every day. That’s why you’re seeing this remarkable acceleration in AWS growth, now for two quarters in a row. A huge thank you to all our AWS customers, and you can be sure we’ll keep working hard for you.”\nHighlights\nFor the third year in a row, customers voted Amazon #1 in corporate reputation in the Harris Poll, a poll that surveys more than 25,000 people and evaluates public perceptions classified into six dimensions of corporate reputation: Workplace Environment, Social Responsibility, Emotional Appeal, Financial Performance, Vision & Leadership, and Products & Services. U.S. consumers ranked Amazon #1 in the American Customer Satisfaction Index for the Internet Retail category for the eighth year in a row. The 50,000-person poll measures perceptions of quality and value across retailers nationwide. Additionally, U.K. customers ranked Amazon.co.uk #1 in customer satisfaction for the fifth consecutive time based on a nationwide poll of 10,000 consumers by the U.K. Customer Satisfaction Index. LinkedIn recognized Amazon as the #1 most desirable workplace in the U.S. based on data about where job seekers want to work and how long employees stay with companies across the country. Amazon and Best Buy announced a multi-year, exclusive collaboration to bring the next generation of Fire TV Edition smart TVs to customers in the U.S. and Canada.

Through a set of easy-to-use templates, customers in the U.S. can create unique experiences for their Alexa-enabled devices in just minutes, including jokes, stories, party games, Q&A, and more. Amazon released new developer tools and Alexa features to make voice-controlled entertainment even easier, including the expansion of far-field voice control on Fire TV for the U.K. and Germany, and additions to the Video Skill API such as capabilities that enable customers to set and manage DVR recordings with their voice. Amazon introduced more ways for Alexa developers to build engaging skills, including the new Alexa Skills Kit developer console, which provides a streamlined experience to help developers create, manage, and publish Alexa skills. Alexa now features more than 40,000 skills created by third-party developers, including new experiences from Lonely Planet, Pokémon, Denny’s, a Westwood One Sports Integration for March Madness, and a premium streaming service from TuneIn exclusively for Alexa.

The Prime Video Direct Film Festival Stars Program has made 70 films available exclusively on Prime Video.

Tens of millions of paid customers are now enjoying Amazon Music, and Amazon Music Unlimited subscriptions grew more than 100% over the last six months. Amazon, Chase, and Whole Foods Market announced that eligible Prime members can earn 5% back on Whole Foods Market purchases when using the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa Card.

Amazon now has 15 fulfillment centers in the U.S. with solar panels producing power, as part of our commitment to host solar energy systems at 50 fulfillment centers by 2020, and our goal to power all of our global infrastructure using 100% renewable energy.

Tens of thousands of customers are using AWS machine learning services, with active users increasing more than 250% in the last year, spurred by the broad adoption of Amazon SageMaker.

AWS announced that all generally available AWS services and features comply with the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), meaning customers can deploy AWS services as a key part of their GDPR compliance plans in advance of the May 25, 2018 enforcement deadline. AWS launched AWS Secrets Manager, a new service that helps customers protect access to their applications, services, and IT resources. With AWS Secrets Manager, customers can easily rotate, manage, and retrieve secrets — such as database credentials and API keys — in the AWS Cloud, on third-party services, and on-premises. AWS announced Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) One Zone-Infrequent Access (Z-IA) and general availability of Amazon S3 Select. Amazon S3 Z-IA is a new storage class that stores objects in a single Availability Zone and is designed for customers who want a lower-cost option for infrequently accessed data, but do not require the multiple Availability Zone data resilience model of other S3 storage classes. Amazon S3 Select enables customers to retrieve only the data they need from an object, which can dramatically improve the performance and reduce the cost of applications that need to access data in S3. AWS launched the general availability of Amazon Transcribe and Amazon Translate, two new machine learning services which are part of the AWS machine learning portfolio. Amazon Transcribe provides grammatically correct transcriptions of audio files to allow audio data to be analyzed, indexed, and searched. Amazon Translate is a deep learning powered machine translation service that provides natural sounding language translation in both real-time and batch scenarios. These services further extend the language capabilities already provided on AWS with Amazon Lex for conversational interfaces, Amazon Polly for Text-to-Speech, and Amazon Comprehend for processing natural language to discover insights and contextual relationships in text. Together with VMware, AWS announced the expansion of VMware Cloud on AWS into Europe and powerful new capabilities for migrating and protecting applications. VMware Cloud on AWS offers customers an operationally consistent and familiar way to run, manage, and secure applications in a hybrid cloud, with access to a broad range of innovative and comprehensive AWS services and robust disaster protection. New customers include The Brinks Company, Scripps Network Interactive, Cerner, and systems integrator DXC, who is launching a new portfolio of managed services for VMware Cloud on AWS. AWS continues to expand its infrastructure, launching two Availability Zones and one Local Region in Osaka, Japan during the first quarter of 2018. AWS now operates 54 Availability Zones within 18 geographic Regions, and one Local Region, with announced plans for 12 more Availability Zones and four more regions in Bahrain, Hong Kong SAR, Sweden, and a second AWS GovCloud Region in the U.S. coming online between now and early 2019.\nFinancial Guidance\nThe following reflect Amazon.com’s expectations as of April 26, 2018, and are subject to substantial uncertainty. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, such as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, and the various factors detailed below.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Guidance\nNet sales are expected to be between $51.0 billion and $54.0 billion, or to grow between 34% and 42% compared with second quarter 2017. This guidance anticipates a favorable impact of approximately $1.2 billion or 320 basis points from foreign exchange rates. Operating income is expected to be between $1.1 billion and $1.9 billion, compared with $628 million in second quarter 2017. This guidance assumes, among other things, that no additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements are concluded.\nA conference call will be webcast live today at 2:30 p.m. PT/5:30 p.m. ET, and will be available for at least three months at www.amazon.com/ir . This call will contain and other material information regarding the Company’s financial and operating results.\nThese are inherently difficult to predict. Actual results could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, in addition to the factors discussed above, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business opportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which the Company enters into, maintains, and develops commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. Other risks and uncertainties include, among others, risks related to new products, services, and technologies, system interruptions, government regulation and taxation, and fraud. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. More information about factors that potentially could affect Amazon.com’s financial results is included in Amazon.com’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings.\nOur investor relations website is www.amazon.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us.

(2) Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, including internal-use software and website development, net of proceeds from property and equipment incentives,” which both are included in cash flow from investing activities. (3) Free cash flow less lease principal repayments is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of capital lease obligations,” and “Principal repayments of finance lease obligations,” which are included in cash flow from financing activities. (4) Free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital leases is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance lease obligations,” which is included in cash flow from financing activities, and property and equipment acquired under capital leases. In this measure, property and equipment acquired under capital leases is reflected as if these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased.
