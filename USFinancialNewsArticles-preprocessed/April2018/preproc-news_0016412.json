(NYSE: SERV), a leading provider of essential residential and commercial services, today announced the appointment of William C. Cobb to its board of directors.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180409005415/en/\nFormer CEO of H&R Block William C. Cobb Named to ServiceMaster Board of Directors (Photo: Business Wire)\nCobb is the former president and chief executive officer of H&R Block, a global consumer tax provider. Prior to joining H&R Block, Cobb served on a number of public boards including Orbitz, Inc., Pacific Sunwear and Och-Ziff, Inc. He joined eBay, Inc. in 2000 where he served in a number of senior executive roles, including president of the eBay North American Marketplace.\n“Bill is a dynamic addition to the board, and will offer powerful counsel and support in our efforts to grow profitably, significantly enhance our service capabilities and deliver long-term, sustainable value,” said ServiceMaster Chairman Mark E. Tomkins. “He has a robust sales, marketing and product background in a variety of household brands and has a keen sense for identifying and executing on consumer needs.”\n“Bill brings tremendous brand and consumer experience to our board of directors,” said ServiceMaster Chief Executive Officer Nik Varty. “As we continue to drive our business transformation and get closer to the spin off of our American Home Shield brand, we’ll count on the leadership of Bill along with the rest of our board of directors to help us increase market penetration through providing excellent service, extending current product offerings and exploring adjacencies across all of our businesses.”\nPrior to joining eBay, Cobb spent ten years at PepsiCo in a variety of marketing leadership positions. When PepsiCo spun off Tricon Global Restaurants (now YUM! Brands) in 1997, Cobb followed the company and served as senior vice president and chief marketing officer of Tricon’s international division, where he was responsible for the brand stewardship and marketing efforts of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell internationally.\nAbout ServiceMaster\nServiceMaster (NYSE: SERV) solves the homeowner’s dilemma.
