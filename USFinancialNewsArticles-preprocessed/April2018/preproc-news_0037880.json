(“Medidata”), including, but not limited to, statements about Medidata’s forecast of financial performance, products and services, business model, strategy and growth opportunities, and competitive position. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in these statements. In particular, the risks and uncertainties include, among other things, risks associated with possible fluctuations in our financial and operating results; errors, interruptions or delays in our service or our web hosting; integration activities, performance and financial impact of acquired companies; our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved versions of our products; changes in our sales and implementation cycles; competition; our ability to retain and expand our customer base or increase new business from those customers; our ability to hire, retain, and motivate our employees and manage our growth; regulatory developments; litigation; and general developments in the economy. For additional disclosure regarding these and other risks faced by Medidata, see disclosures contained in Medidata’s public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the “Risk Factors” section of Medidata’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. You should consider these factors in evaluating the forward-looking statements included in this press release and not place undue reliance on such statements. The forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof, and Medidata undertakes no obligation to update such statements as a result of new information.\n(1) Non-GAAP Financial Information\nMedidata provides non-GAAP operating income, net income, and net income per share applicable to common stockholders data as additional information for its operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP operating income excludes the impact of depreciation, amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, stock-based compensation expense, and adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration. Non-GAAP net income excludes the tax-effected impact of amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash interest expense, and adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration. Management uses these non-GAAP measures to evaluate its financial results, develop budgets, manage expenditures, and as an important factor in determining variable compensation. In addition, investors frequently have requested information from management regarding depreciation, amortization, and other non-cash charges, such as share-based compensation, and management believes, based on discussions with investors, that these non-GAAP measures enhance investors’ ability to assess Medidata’s historical and projected future financial performance. While management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures. One limitation of non-GAAP operating income is that it excludes depreciation and amortization, which represents the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our business. Medidata compensates for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP results, which are attached to this press release.\n(2) Adjusted subscription backlog equals subscription backlog plus outstanding intra-year renewals valued at an amount equal to the contracts to be renewed.\nMEDIDATA SOLUTIONS, INC.

Reconciliation of GAAP Operating Income and GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP Operating Income and Non-GAAP Net Income (Unaudited) (Amounts in thousands, except per share data) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Operating income: GAAP operating income $ 13,326 $ 12,879 (4) GAAP operating margins 8.9 % 10.1 % (4) Stock-based compensation 13,155 10,321 Depreciation and amortization 7,813 4,476 Contingent consideration adjustment (1) (72 ) — Non-GAAP operating income $ 34,222 $ 27,676 (4) Non-GAAP operating margins 22.9 % 21.7 % (4) Net income: GAAP net income $ 10,325 $ 9,980 (4) Stock-based compensation 13,155 10,321 Amortization 1,214 537 Contingent consideration adjustment (1) (72 ) — Non-cash interest expense (2) 3,908 3,598 Tax impact on add-back items (3) (4,551 ) (5,782 ) Non-GAAP net income $ 23,979 $ 18,654 (4) GAAP basic earnings per share $ 0.18 $ 0.18 (4) GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 0.17 $ 0.17 (4) Non-GAAP basic earnings per share $ 0.42 $ 0.33 (4) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $ 0.40 $ 0.32 (4)\n(1) Amount represents the change in fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities. (2) Non-cash interest expense includes amortization of debt discount and issuance costs on our 1.00% convertible senior notes issued in 2013 and amortization of issuance costs on our credit agreement entered into in 2017. We exclude this incremental non-cash interest expense for purposes of calculating non-GAAP net income. We believe that excluding these expenses from our non-GAAP measures is useful to investors because such incremental non-cash interest expense does not generate a cash outflow, nor do the debt issuance costs represent a cash outflow except in the period of issuance; therefore both are not indicative of our continuing operations. (3) Tax impact calculated using tax rates of 25% and 40% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. (4) Figures for the three months ended March 31, 2017 have been recast to reflect our January 1, 2018 full retrospective adoption of ASC 606. The table above presents a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP operating income, net income, and net income per share applicable to common stockholders for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017. Non-GAAP operating income (EBITDAO) excludes the impact of depreciation, amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, stock-based compensation expense, and adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration. Non-GAAP net income excludes the tax-affected impact of amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, stock-based compensation expense, adjustments to the fair value of contingent consideration, and non-cash interest expense.\nMEDIDATA SOLUTIONS, INC.
