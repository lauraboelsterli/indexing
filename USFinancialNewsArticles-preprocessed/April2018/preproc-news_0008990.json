    "text": "Mark Zuckerberg testified Facebook did not notify the FTC of the Cambridge Analytica data leak years ago because the social media giant \"considered it a closed case.\" \nThe Facebook founder and CEO spoke at a joint hearing of the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees Tuesday, the first of two congressional hearings this week.\nWatch the live stream of Zuckerberg's testimony here . \nThe company is facing questions following reports that research firm Cambridge Analytica improperly gained access to the personal data of as many as 87 million Facebook users .\nFacebook has said it first learned of the leak in 2015 and demanded Cambridge Analytica delete the data then. Executives have since said it was a mistake to trust that the research firm had done so. \n\"We considered it a closed case. In retrospect that was clearly a mistake. We shouldn't have taken their word for it,\" Zuckerberg said Tuesday.\nFacebook did not notify the FTC — which signed a consent decree with the tech company in 2011 requiring that Facebook notify users if their personal data is shared beyond their specified privacy settings — Zuckerberg said, \"for the same reason.\" \n\"We considered it a closed case,\" Zuckerberg said, adding that he would act differently were he to face that decision again. \nThe FTC last month said it was investigating whether Facebook had violated the 2011 decree — a rare confirmation of an ongoing probe. \nZuckerberg is likely to face more tough questions during his week on Capitol Hill on user privacy, foreign meddling on the site and abuse of social media tools.\nThe CEO said during Tuesday's hearing that \"there will always be a version of Facebook that is free,\" clarifying recent comments by COO Sheryl Sandberg that an ad-free version of Facebook would have to be a paid product. \nHe also expressed confidence that Facebook would better tamp down meddling in 2018 elections.\nFacebook is cooperating with Special Counsel Robert Mueller while he investigates links between the Trump campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election, Zuckerberg said. \nHe's scheduled to testify before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Wednesday. His prepared remarks for that hearing were released Monday.\nFacebook stock surged more than 4 percent Tuesday during Zuckerberg's comments. \nThis is breaking news. Please check back for updates.",
