    "text": "UPDATE 2-FDA cracks down on sales of Juul tobacco products to minors Published 2:01 PM ET Tue, 24 April 2018 Reuters\n(Adds comment from Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, background)\nApril 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday said it launched a crackdown on the sale of e-cigarettes and tobacco products to minors, particularly those developed by Juul Labs Inc.\nThe regulator said https://bit.ly/2qUJYff it had issued 40 warning letters to retailers, including multiple 7-Eleven stores, for violations regarding illegal sales of Juul products, after uncovering violations through compliance checks since the beginning of March.\n\"The FDA has been conducting a large-scale, undercover nationwide blitz to crack down on the sale of e-cigarettes specifically Juul products to minors at both brick-and-mortar and online retailers,\" FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement.\nMatthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, commended the FDA's action, but said the regulator must do more \"by taking off the market Juul flavors like mango and cool cucumber that clearly appeal to kids\".\nE-cigarettes are handheld electronic devices that vaporize a fluid typically including nicotine and a flavor component. They have been grabbing market share away from traditional tobacco companies, and are available in different flavors.\nThe FDA said that such products are also more difficult for parents and teachers to recognize or detect, potentially adding to its appeal for the youth.\nJuul Labs, launched in 2015, brands its products as an alternative for adult smokers. The San Francisco-based firm offers a number of products designed for tobacco as an alternative to ordinary cigarettes, including e-cigarettes and vaporizers.\nJuul in a statement said it agreed \"with the FDA that illegal sales of our product to minors is unacceptable\" and would announce \"more aggressive plans\" regarding the violations in the coming days.\nThe FDA also said eBay Inc removed several listings of Juul products after the regulator raised concerns.
