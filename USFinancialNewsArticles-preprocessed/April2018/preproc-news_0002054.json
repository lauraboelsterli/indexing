    "text": "ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. and WILSON, N.C., April 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- PB Financial Corporation, the holding company for Providence Bank (\"Providence\"), and CB Financial Corporation (\"CB\", OTC-QB: CBFA), parent company of Cornerstone Bank (\"Cornerstone\"), have completed the merger between the two companies announced on August 1, 2017. In the transaction, CB merged into PB Financial Corporation, Providence's recently-formed holding company, and Cornerstone merged into Providence, creating a community banking company with $424 million in assets. The combined company has total loans of $331 million and total deposits of $345 million as of December 31, 2017.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, CB shareholders received cash of 23.5 cents for each issued and outstanding share of CB common stock. The transaction, which received all necessary regulatory and shareholder approvals, was valued at $11.2 million.\nWhile the merger is complete, the Cornerstone office in Wilson will continue to operate under the Cornerstone name until the close of business on Friday, April 27, 2018, when a systems conversion will take place. The Wilson office will begin operating under the Providence Bank name on Monday, April 30, 2018. Providence, headquartered in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, will operate five full-service offices serving the eastern North Carolina communities of Rocky Mount, Nashville, Tarboro and Wilson.\nTed E. Whitehurst, president and chief executive officer of PB Financial Corporation and Providence, said, \"Our experienced team, which now includes the bankers who worked with Cornerstone, knows these communities and they know banking. We live here, work here and are raising families here. We are excited about the expansion of Providence and the opportunity it gives us to work with even more people in eastern North Carolina. Our shareholders are pleased with what this represents for the company, too, as we believe the merger will be immediately accretive to earnings.\"\nMark A. Holmes, former president and chief executive officer of CB and Cornerstone who will remain with Providence through year-end 2018, shared, \"The culture of these banks, as I said earlier, is very similar. We have seasoned bankers serving customers who want something big banks just can't offer â€“ personal service from people who make decisions locally and who care about these communities. The future is bright for Providence.\"\nThe former Board of Directors of CB Financial Corporation now comprises a newly-formed Providence Bank-Wilson Advisory Board.\nThe combined bank's pro forma capital ratios will exceed regulatory well-capitalized guidelines. Providence completed a $12 million stock offering in February that was used to help fund the cash consideration in the merger and to support future growth.\nFIG Partners, LLC served as PB/Providence's financial advisor and Wyrick Robbins Yates & Ponton LLP served as legal counsel to PB/Providence. Smith Capital, Inc. served as CB/Cornerstone's financial advisor and Brooks, Pierce, McLendon, Humphrey & Leonard, LLP served as legal counsel to CB/Cornerstone.\nAbout PB Financial Corporation.\nPB Financial Corporation is the newly-formed holding company for Providence Bank, a North Carolina state-chartered community bank headquartered at 450 North Winstead Avenue in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, with two branches in Rocky Mount, one in Tarboro and one in Nashville, North Carolina.
