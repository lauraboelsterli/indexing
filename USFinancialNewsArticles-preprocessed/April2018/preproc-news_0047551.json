    "text": "JAKARTA, Indonesia, April 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Perusahaan Perseroan (Persero) PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara (the \" Company \") today announced that it has commenced tender offers to purchase for cash (the \" Tender Offers \") any and all of the outstanding 2019 Notes, 2020 Notes, and 2037 Notes (together with the 2019 Notes and the 2020 Notes, the \"Notes\"). The Tender Offers are being made pursuant to a Tender Offer Memorandum, dated April 25, 2018 (the \"Tender Offer Memorandum\"). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings assigned to them in the Tender Offer Memorandum.\nThe Tender Offers will expire at 5:00 p.m., New York time, on May 4, 2018, unless extended or earlier terminated as described in the Tender Offer Memorandum (such time and date, as they may be extended, the \"Expiration Time\"). Holders of Notes who validly tender (and do not validly withdraw) their Notes prior to the Expiration Time, or who deliver to the Information and Tender Agent a properly completed and duly executed Notice of Guaranteed Delivery in accordance with the instructions described in the Tender Offer Memorandum prior to the Expiration Time, will receive in cash, for Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase by the Company, U.S.$1,066.75 per U.S.$1,000 principal amount for the 2019 Notes, U.S.$1,074.00 per U.S.$1,000 principal amount for the 2020 Notes, and U.S.$1,295.00 per U.S.$1,000 principal amount for the 2037 Notes. The purchase price for each U.S.$1,000 principal amount of each Series of Notes validly tendered at or prior to the Expiration Date or the Guaranteed Delivery Date pursuant to the Guaranteed Delivery Procedures, and not validly withdrawn, is referred to herein as the \" Consideration \". In addition to the applicable Consideration, Holders whose Notes of a given Series are accepted for purchase will be paid accrued and unpaid interest on such Notes in accordance with the terms of their corresponding indentures governing the respective Series of the Notes to, but not including, the Payment Date. Interest will cease to accrue on the Payment Date for all Notes accepted in the Tender Offers, including those tendered through the Guaranteed Delivery Procedures. Any Notes not validly tendered or not accepted for payment pursuant to the Tender Offers will continue to accrue interest in accordance with the terms of their corresponding Indentures. No tenders will be valid if submitted after the Expiration Time. Notes accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offers, including those Notes for which the guaranteed delivery procedures set out in the Tender Offer Memorandum are used, will be paid for through the Clearing Systems on a date promptly following the Expiration Date (such date, the \" Payment Date \"). The Company currently expects the Payment Date to be May 9, 2018, or the third Business Day in New York following the Expiration Time.\nThe Company has announced the Tender Offers as part of a refinancing transaction pursuant to which the aggregate Consideration will be derived from the concurrent offering or offerings (\" New Note Issuance \") of new debt securities (\" New Notes \") on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Company. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete the New Notes Issuance or generate sufficient gross proceeds raised in the New Note Issuance, and thus, satisfy the Financing Condition (as defined in the Tender Offer Memorandum). If the Financing Condition is not satisfied in respect of all the Tender Offers due to a shortfall in gross proceeds from the New Note Issuance, then the Company will accept for purchase all Notes of each Series 2 tendered in accordance with applicable Acceptance Priority Levels, as more fully described in the Tender Offer Memorandum.\nThe following table shows the Notes included in the Tender Offers as well as the principal amount outstanding and the Consideration with respect to each series of Notes:\nTitle of Security\nCUSIP Number/ISIN\nNominal Amount\nOutstanding\nConsideration\n8.00% Notes due\nAugust 2019\nCUSIP: N54360 AE7,\nISIN: USN54360AE78\n(Regulation S)\nCUSIP: 56068T AE7,\nISIN: US56068TAE73\n(Rule 144A)\nU.S.$750,000,000\nU.S.$1,066.75 per\nU.S.$1,000 principal\namount\n7.75% Notes due\nJanuary 2020\nCUSIP: N54360AF4,\nISIN: USN54360AF44\n(Regulation S)\nCUSIP: 56068TAF4,\nISIN: US56068TAF49\n(Rule 144A)\nU.S.$1,250,000,000\nU.S.$1,074.00 per\nU.S.$1,000 principal\namount\n7.875% Notes due\nJune 2037\nCUSIP: N54360AD9,\nISIN: USN54360AD95\n(Regulation S)\nCUSIP: 56068T AD9,\nISIN: US56068TAD90\n(Rule 144A)\nU.S.$500,000,000\nU.S.$1,295.00 per\nU.S.$1,000 principal\namount\nTendered Notes may be withdrawn at any time at or prior to the Expiration Time so long as they are validly withdrawn in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Tender Offer Memorandum. The Tender Offer for each Series of Notes is independent of and not conditioned upon the Tender Offer for any of the other Series of Notes, meaning that the Company may, subject to applicable law, extend, re-open, amend and/or terminate the Tender Offer with respect any Series of Notes without affecting the Tender Offer for any of the other Series of Notes, and vice versa. Furthermore, the Company may, subject to applicable law, choose to reject or accept tenders with respect to any Series of Notes without rejecting or accepting, in whole or in part, tenders with respect to the other Series of Notes. The purchase of any Series of Notes is not conditioned upon the purchase of any other Series of Notes. However, any Notes validly tendered in the Tender Offers and accepted for purchase will be accepted for purchase by the Company based on the Acceptance Priority Levels, each as more fully described in the Tender Offer Memorandum.\nThe Company has engaged Citigroup Global Markets Inc., The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, Mandiri Securities Pte.

No offer or invitation to acquire or exchange any notes is being made pursuant to this announcement. This announcement and the Tender Offer Memorandum contain important information, which must be read carefully before any decision is made with respect to the Tender Offers. If any holder of Notes is in any doubt as to the action it should take, it is recommended to seek its own legal, tax and financial advice, including as to any tax consequences, from its stockbroker, bank manager, solicitor, accountant or other independent financial adviser. Any individual or company whose Notes are held on its behalf by a broker, dealer, bank, custodian, trust company or other nominee must contact such entity if it wishes to participate in the Tender Offers. None of the Company, the Dealer Managers, D.F. King, or any person who controls, or is a director, officer, employee or agent of such persons, or any affiliate of such persons, makes any recommendation as to whether holders of Notes should participate in the Tender Offers.\nUnited Kingdom\nThe communication of this announcement, the Tender Offer Memorandum and any other documents or materials relating to the Tender Offers are not being made, and such documents and/or materials have not been approved, by an authorised person for the purposes of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the \"FSMA\"). Accordingly, such documents and/or materials are not being distributed to, and must not be passed on to, the general public in the United Kingdom. The communication of such documents and/or materials is exempt from the restriction on financial promotions under section 21 of the FSMA on the basis that it is only directed at and may be communicated to (i) persons who are existing members or creditors of the Company or other persons within the meaning of Article 43 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (the \"Order\"); (ii) persons who fall within Article 49 of the Order (\"high net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.\"); or (iii) any other persons to whom these documents and/or materials may lawfully be communicated. Any investment or investment activity to which this announcement or the Tender Offer Memorandum relate is available only to such persons or will be engaged only with such persons and other persons should not rely on it.\nGeneral\nThis announcement, the Tender Offer Memorandum and any related documents do not constitute an offer to buy or the solicitation of an offer to sell securities in any circumstances or jurisdictions in which such offer or solicitation is unlawful. Securities may not be offered or sold in the United States or to, or for the account or benefit of U.S. persons absent registration pursuant to the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (\"Securities Act\"), or an exemption from registration. Any public offering of securities to be made in the United States will be made by means of an offering memorandum that will contain detailed information about the Company and its management, as well as financial statements. If a jurisdiction requires the Tender Offers to be made by a licensed broker or dealer, and any of the Dealer Managers or any of their respective affiliates is such a licensed broker or dealer in such jurisdictions, the Tender Offers shall be deemed to be made by such Dealer Manager or such affiliate (as the case may be) on behalf of the Company in such jurisdiction.\nIn addition to the representations referred to above in respect of the United Kingdom, each holder of Notes participating in the Tender Offers will also be deemed to give certain representations in respect of the other jurisdictions referred to above and generally as set out in \"Procedures for Tendering Notes\" in the Tender Offer Memorandum. Any tender of Notes for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offers from a holder of Notes that is unable to make these representations will not be accepted. Each of the Company, the Dealer Managers and D.F. King reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to investigate, in relation to any tender of Notes for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offers, whether any such representation given by a holder of Notes is correct and, if such investigation is undertaken and as a result the Company determines (for any reason) that such representation is not correct, such tender of Notes shall not be accepted.\nThe securities referred to herein have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws of the United States, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state laws. The Company has no intent to register any such securities in the United States or any other jurisdiction. The New Notes will only be offered to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A of the Securities Act and outside the United States under Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/perusahaan-perseroan-persero-pt-perusahaan-listrik-negara-the-company-commences-cash-tender-offers-300636416.html\nSOURCE Perusahaan Perseroan (Persero) PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara",
