    "text": "'Despacito' and Videos by Taylor Swift and Drake Were Targeted by Hackers Screenshot via YouTube/Vevo April 10, 2018 \nViewers searching for the wildly popular “ Despacito ” music video saw something unexpected on Tuesday. \nThe video for the Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee track, which has been viewed more than 5 billion times on YouTube and became the site’s most-watched video last year , was one of many titles compromised by hackers targeting clips from music video platform Vevo, the BBC reports . \nHackers going by Prosox and Kuroi’sh claimed responsibility for the breach on Twitter. The hackers replaced the “ Despacito ” cover image on YouTube with a photo of people wearing masks and pointing guns at the camera, according to a screenshot taken by the BBC, and sprinkled their own names, nicknames and messages — including “Free Palestine” — across videos from artists including Taylor Swift, Drake, Shakira, and Selena Gomez. \nThe videos were temporarily taken down once the problem was discovered, the BBC adds. @Vevo for us it was just a game. you can dm me @Prosoxhacker or Kuroi'SH ( @sh_kuroi or @GKimiaie , sh_kuroi unless he prooves he's the real.) I know Kuroi'SH since 2015. ",
