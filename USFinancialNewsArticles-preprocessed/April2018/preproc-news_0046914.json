    "text": "Reblog Tech's biggest unicorn just gave a big boost to the earnings of Google parent Alphabet . Alphabet said Monday its first-quarter earnings benefited from $3 billion in gains on the value of the stakes it owns in ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc. and other hot tech startup firms, thanks to a new accounting rule that takes effect this year.
