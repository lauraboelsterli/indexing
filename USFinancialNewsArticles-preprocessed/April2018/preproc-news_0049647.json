    "text": "BAKERSFIELD, Calif., April 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Valley Republic Bancorp (OTCQX: VLLX) today announced its financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights for the 1 st Quarter of 2018 Compared to the 1 st Quarter of 2017:\nNet income - up 87% Pretax income - up 39% Net loans - up 13% Deposits - up 6% Total assets - up 6% Basic earnings per share increased from $0.33 to $0.60 (up 82%) Book value per share increased from $13.91 to $15.43 (up 11%)\nFinancial Performance\nValley Republic Bancorp reported record net income for the first quarter of 2018. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, this year's net income of $2,315,000 is an increase of $1,078,000, or 87%. Basic earnings per share for this quarter were $0.60, compared to $0.33 basic earnings per share reported for the same quarter last year, an increase of 82%.\nBruce Jay, President & CEO, stated, \"Valley Republic Bancorp launched 2018 with an exceptional, record breaking quarter. Pretax income was 39% higher than the same quarter in 2017. We are now in our tenth year of operation and have achieved fourth place in market share of Kern County deposits, trailing only the three largest national banks. The Bank's performance is attributable to several factors. We are approaching $700 million in assets, which allows our size, along with continued diligent cost controls, to further improve operational efficiencies. Deposit and loan growth continue to be strong due to our brand promise to provide relationship-based 'Uncommon Service' to the local community.\n\"Net income for the quarter was 87% higher than the same quarter in 2017. A significant contributor to this substantial increase was lower income tax rates compared to the prior year. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act became effective January 1, 2018, lowering the highest federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Also, in 2009 stock options were granted to founders and directors for their time and expertise in obtaining a new bank charter. Most of these options expire in February of 2019. During the first quarter of this year, some options were exercised to purchase Company shares at the contractual strike price. The difference between the purchase price and the current fair market value of the stock at the time of exercise creates a tax deduction for the Company. Income tax expense was reduced in the first quarter by approximately $400,000 due to the benefit realized by the Company from these transactions.\"\nGrowth\nTotal assets were $681.3 million at the end of the first quarter of 2018. Compared to $667.6 million at year-end 2017, this is an increase of $13.7 million, or 2.1%. When compared to the end of the first quarter last year, this represents an increase of $36.8 million, or 6%.\nTotal net loans were $451.3 million at March 31, 2018. Compared to $ 441.7 million at December 31, 2017, this is an increase of $9.5 million, or 2%. Compared to the end of the first quarter of 2017, this is an increase of $51 million, or 13%. At March 31, 2018, the Bank had no nonperforming loans or loan payments that were more than 30 days delinquent.\nTotal deposits were $615.5 million at March 31, 2018. This is an increase of $12.2 million, or 2%, when compared to $603.3 million at December 31, 2017. Compared to the end of the first quarter last year, this is an increase of $32.1 million, or 6%.\nEugene Voiland, Chairman of the Board, stated, \"The Valley Republic Bank story is impressive. We are proud of our accomplishments in such a short period of time. The Board of Directors is engaged and diligent in the governance of the Bank. We have developed a terrific team that delivers a valued product for the community, every day. These factors, along with a high quality loan portfolio with no non-preforming assets, allow Valley Republic Bank to provide local, responsive and reliable service to the community at the highest level.\"\nCapital\nTotal shareholders' equity at March 31, 2018 was $59.3 million, an increase of $2.9 million, or 5%, compared to $56.4 million at December 31, 2017. Compared to March 31, 2017, total shareholders' equity has increased by $7.6 million, or 15%.\nAbout Valley Republic Bancorp and Valley Republic Bank\nValley Republic Bancorp is a bank holding company formed in 2016.
