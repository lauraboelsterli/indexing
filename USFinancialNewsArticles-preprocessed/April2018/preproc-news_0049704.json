    "text": "Company Grew Net Sales by 14% to $1.7 Billion; Realized and Announced Price Actions Expected to Overcome Inflation in 2018\nInsulation grew EBIT by $27 million on strong price execution and contribution from acquisitions Roofing reported 15% EBIT margins as material and transportation inflation outpaced positive pricing Composites delivered flat revenue versus a strong prior year comparison Integration of Paroc on-track\nTOLEDO, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Owens Corning (NYSE: OC) today reported consolidated net sales of $1.7 billion in first-quarter 2018, compared with net sales of $1.5 billion in first-quarter 2017, an increase of 14%.\nFirst-quarter 2018 net earnings attributable to Owens Corning were $92 million, or $0.82 per diluted share, compared with $101 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, during the comparable quarter in 2017. First-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings were $90 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, compared with $97 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, during the same period one year ago (See Use of Non-GAAP Measures, See Table 3).\n“Owens Corning is on-track to deliver another year of strong financial performance, despite the greater than expected inflation that we have experienced,” said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike Thaman. “The company grew revenue in the first quarter by 14%, but inflation negatively impacted margins in all three businesses. We had good realization on our price actions in the quarter and have announced additional pricing actions intended to address our inflation outlook. We are confident in our ability to manage current market conditions and achieve our targets, as the strong fundamentals of the businesses remain unchanged.”\nConsolidated First-Quarter 2018 Results\nOwens Corning sustained a high level of safety performance in first-quarter 2018, with a recordable incident rate of 0.46, compared with 0.49 in first-quarter 2017, representing a 6% reduction. Reported earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for first-quarter 2018 were $131 million, compared with $170 million during the same period in 2017. Adjusted EBIT in first-quarter 2018 was $152 million, down from $171 million in 2017 (See Table 2). During first-quarter 2018, Owens Corning repurchased 1.0 million shares of its common stock for $83 million. As of the end of the quarter, 6.5 million shares were available for repurchase under the current authorization.\nOther Significant Matters\nOn February 5, 2018, the company completed the acquisition of Paroc Group, a leading producer of mineral wool insulation in Europe, further broadening the product portfolio and expanding the geographic footprint of the Insulation business. The company issued $400 million of 30-year notes at 4.4% on January 25, 2018 in association with this transaction.\n2018 Outlook\nThe company expects an environment consistent with consensus expectations for U.S. housing starts and global industrial production growth. In Roofing, the company expects growth in both the new construction and remodeling markets. Storm demand at historical averages would result in a mid-single digit decline of the overall asphalt shingle market. The components business is expected to grow at a double-digit rate. The company continues to expect to achieve sufficient pricing in the year to overcome the impact of asphalt and transportation cost inflation. In Composites, the company expects continued growth in the glass fiber market, driven by global industrial production growth. Despite higher than anticipated inflation in the first quarter, the company continues to target an EBIT improvement of about $20 million, with the benefit of market growth and improved pricing partly offset by accelerated inflation and higher rebuild costs. In Insulation, the company continues to expect to deliver EBIT growth of $150 million. First-quarter price realization is ahead of the previously disclosed expectation, but the additional progress is anticipated to be offset by transportation inflation in 2018. The current EBIT outlook does not include the potential benefit of future price activity, primarily in the U.S. residential new construction business. The company estimates an effective tax rate of 26 percent to 28 percent. The company also continues to expect a cash tax rate of 10 percent to 12 percent on adjusted pre-tax earnings, due to the company’s U.S. tax net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards. The company expects general corporate expenses to be between $140 million and $150 million in 2018. Capital additions in 2018 are expected to total approximately $500 million. Interest expense is expected to be between $125 million and $130 million. For full-year 2018, the company expects to convert adjusted earnings into free cash flow at about 100%.\nNext Earnings Announcement\nSecond-quarter 2018 results will be announced on Wednesday, July 25, 2018.\nFirst-Quarter 2018 Conference Call and Presentation\nWednesday, April 25, 2018\n11 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time\nAll Callers\nLive dial-in telephone number: U.S. 1.888.317.6003; Canada 1.866.284.3684; and other international +1.412.317.6061.\nEntry number: 461-6124 (Please dial in 10-15 minutes before conference call start time)\nLive webcast: https://services.choruscall.com/links/oc180425.html\nTelephone and Webcast Replay\nTelephone replay will be available one hour after the end of the call through May 2, 2018.

For more information, please visit www.owenscorning.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nOwens Corning uses non-GAAP measures in its earnings press release that are intended to supplement investors’ understanding of the company’s financial information. These non-GAAP measures include EBIT, adjusted EBIT, adjusted earnings, adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to Owens Corning common stockholders (“adjusted EPS”), adjusted pre-tax earnings, free cash flow and free cash flow conversion. When used to report historical financial information, reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures are included in the financial tables of this press release. Specifically see Table 2 for EBIT and adjusted EBIT, Table 3 for adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS, and Table 8 for free cash flow.\nFor purposes of internal review of Owens Corning’s year-over-year operational performance, management excludes from net earnings attributable to Owens Corning certain items it believes are not representative of ongoing operations. The non-GAAP financial measures resulting from these adjustments (including adjusted EBIT, adjusted earnings, adjusted EPS and adjusted pre-tax earnings) are used internally by Owens Corning for various purposes, including reporting results of operations to the Board of Directors, analysis of performance, and related employee compensation measures. Management believes that these adjustments result in a measure that provides a useful representation of its operational performance; however, the adjusted measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings attributable to Owens Corning as prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP liquidity measure used by investors, financial analysts and management to help evaluate the company's ability to generate cash to pursue opportunities that enhance shareholder value. Free cash flow is not a measure of residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures due to the company’s mandatory debt service requirements. As a conversion ratio, free cash flow is compared to adjusted earnings. Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are used internally by the company for various purposes, including reporting results of operations to the Board of Directors of the company and analysis of performance. Management believes that these measures provide a useful representation of our operational performance and liquidity; however, the measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net cash flow provided by operating activities or net earnings attributable to Owens Corning as prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWhen the company provides forward-looking expectations for non-GAAP measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation between the non-GAAP expectations and the corresponding GAAP measures are generally not available without unreasonable effort due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of the adjusting items that would be excluded from the non-GAAP measures in future periods. The variability in timing and amount of adjusting items could have significant and unpredictable effect on our future GAAP results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
