    "text": "The Ultra-High Resolution CT System Delivers Twice the Resolution of Today’s CT Systems\nTUSTIN, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Canon Medical Systems USA, Inc.’s newly FDA-cleared Aquilion Precision™ is the world’s first Ultra-High Resolution CT system (UHR CT). The system can resolve anatomy as small as 150 microns and is designed to provide more than twice the resolution, typically seen only in cath labs. Containing an all-new detector as well as tube, gantry and reconstruction technologies, the system may make it possible to help expand visualization of disease thanks to new features that offer improved image detail.\nThe Aquilion Precision CT system features dose efficiency with detector channels that are only 0.25 mm thick. This, combined with substantial improvements in scintillator quantum efficiency, detector circuitry and other DAS components, results in a dose-efficient detector with ultra-high resolution capabilities. The system features resolution never before seen in CT imaging with the industry’s smallest Focal Spot Tube at 0.4 mm x 0.5 mm and the industry’s first routine 1024 x 1024 Reconstruction Matrix.\n“The increased amount of information delivered by the Aquilion Precision opens new doors for healthcare providers,” said Dominic Smith, senior director, CT, PET/CT, and MR Business Units, Canon Medical Systems USA. “The system delivers higher resolution images than other systems on the market, enabling customers to deliver better patient care.”\nAbout Canon Medical Systems USA, Inc.\nCanon Medical Systems USA, Inc., headquartered in Tustin, Calif., markets, sells, distributes and services radiology and cardiovascular systems, including CT, MR, ultrasound, X-ray and interventional X-ray equipment.
