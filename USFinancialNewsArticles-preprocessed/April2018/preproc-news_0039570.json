    "text": "PASADENA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- East West Bancorp, Inc. (“East West” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: EWBC), parent company of East West Bank, the financial bridge between the United States and Greater China, today reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2018. For the first quarter of 2018, net income was $187.0 million or $1.28 per diluted share. First quarter 2018 return on average assets was 2.03%, return on average equity was 19.3% and return on average tangible 1 equity was 22.3%.\n“We are pleased with the solid balance sheet growth in the first quarter of 2018. Total loans grew $547 million, or 8% annualized, to a record $29.6 billion from $29.1 billion as of December 31, 2017,” stated Dominic Ng, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of East West. “Total deposits grew $389 million, or 5% annualized, to a record $32.6 billion as of March 31, 2018 from $32.2 billion at the end of 2017.”\n“During the quarter, East West’s net interest margin expanded by 16 basis points to 3.73%, reflecting the benefits of higher interest rates on our asset sensitive balance sheet. The yield on average loans expanded by 17 basis points compared to an increase in the cost of deposits of six basis points,” continued Ng. “Upward repricing of variable rate loans drove the increase in yields. Margin expansion was additionally supported by our attractive deposit mix, 36% of which was noninterest-bearing demand deposits as of March 31, 2018. During this period of rising interest rates, our net interest margin has expanded over the past six consecutive quarters.”\n“Net interest margin expansion in the first quarter of 2018 was the primary driver for the sequential quarter operating revenue growth, in excess of expense growth. Net interest income increased by 2%, or 9% annualized, from the fourth quarter of 2017. Noninterest expense decreased in the first quarter of 2018, compared to the fourth quarter of 2017; we continue to ensure strong expense discipline whilst making investments in talent and infrastructure to strengthen East West’s franchise and enhance our value proposition for our clients,” concluded Ng.\nHIGHLIGHTS OF RESULTS\nFirst Quarter Earnings – Net income of $187.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 120% compared to $84.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017; diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) of $1.28 also increased by 120% linked quarter from $0.58. First quarter net income included $22.2 million of after tax gain on the sale of Desert Community Bank (“DCB”) branches, and fourth quarter net income included $41.7 million of additional income tax expense related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, impacting quarter-over-quarter comparisons. Excluding these items, adjusted 2 net income of $164.9 million and adjusted 2 diluted EPS of $1.13 for the first quarter of 2018 both increased by 30% from the fourth quarter of 2017. Sale of Desert Community Bank Branches – In March 2018, East West Bank closed the sale of its eight DCB branches, including $613.7 million of deposits, $59.1 million of loans, and other related assets. In the first quarter of 2018, East West recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of $31.5 million or $22.2 million after tax. The diluted EPS impact from the DCB sale was $0.15, net of tax. Net Interest Income Growth and Net Interest Margin Expansion – Net interest income totaled $326.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $7.0 million, or 2% linked quarter, primarily due to the expansion of loan yields and loan growth. First quarter 2018 net interest margin (“NIM”) of 3.73% expanded by 16 basis points linked quarter. Record Loans – Total loans of $29.6 billion as of March 31, 2018 were up $547.5 million or 2%, from $29.1 billion as of December 31, 2017. DCB loans sold did not materially impact linked quarter growth comparisons, which still would have been 2% had the loans not been sold. The strongest sequential quarter loan growth came from the single family mortgage portfolio; quarter-over-quarter, all commercial lending categories grew. Total loans grew by 12% year-over-year. Record Deposits – Total deposits of $32.6 billion as of March 31, 2018 were up $388.6 million or 1%, from $32.2 billion as of December 31, 2017. Total deposits grew by 7% year-over-year. Deposit growth in the quarter more than offset the impact of the DCB branch sale. Adding back the $613.7 million of deposits sold, deposit growth would have been 3% linked quarter and 9% year-over-year. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits of $11.8 billion were 36% of total deposits as of March 31, 2018, an increase from 34% as of December 31, 2017. Asset Quality Metrics – The allowance for loan losses was $297.7 million, or 1.01% of loans held-for-investment (“HFI”), as of March 31, 2018, compared to $287.1 million, or 0.99% of loans HFI, as of December 31, 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, annualized net charge-offs were 0.13% of average loans HFI, compared to annualized net charge-offs of 0.22% of average loans HFI for the previous quarter. Non-purchased credit impaired (“Non-PCI”) nonperforming assets were $131.0 million, or 0.35% of total assets, as of March 31, 2018. Capital Levels – Capital levels for East West continue to be strong. As of March 31, 2018, stockholders’ equity was $4.0 billion, or $27.46 per share. Tangible equity 3 per common share was $24.07 as of March 31, 2018, an increase of 4% linked quarter and 14% year-over-year. As of March 31, 2018, the tangible equity to tangible assets ratio 3 was 9.37%, the Common Equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital ratio was 11.9%, and the total risk-based capital ratio was 13.4%.\n1\nSee reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in Table 13.\n2 See reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in Table 10.\n3 See reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in Table 13.\nQUARTERLY RESULTS SUMMARY\nQuarter Ended ($ in millions, except per share data) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Net income $ 187.0 $ 84.9 $ 169.7 Adjusted net income (1) $ 164.9 $ 126.6 $ 128.2 Earnings per share (diluted) $ 1.28 $ 0.58 $ 1.16 Adjusted earnings per share (diluted) (1) $ 1.13 $ 0.87 $ 0.88 Book value per common share $ 27.46 $ 26.58 $ 24.68 Tangible equity (1) per common share $ 24.07 $ 23.13 $ 21.20 Tangible equity to tangible assets ratio (1) 9.37 % 9.12 % 8.79 % Return on average assets (2) 2.03 % 0.90 % 1.97 % Return on average equity (2) 19.34 % 8.73 % 19.71 % Return on average tangible equity (1)(2) 22.30 % 10.17 % 23.21 % Adjusted return on average assets (1)(2) 1.79 % 1.35 % 1.49 % Adjusted return on average equity (1)(2) 17.04 % 13.02 % 14.88 % Adjusted return on average tangible equity (1)(2) 19.68 % 15.10 % 17.57 % Adjusted pre-tax, pre-provision profitability ratio (1)(2) 2.38 % 2.27 % 2.09 % Net interest income $ 326.7 $ 319.7 $ 272.1 Net interest margin (2) 3.73 % 3.57 % 3.33 % Cost of deposits (2) 0.49 % 0.43 % 0.32 % Efficiency ratio 42.2 % 48.0 % 39.4 % Adjusted efficiency ratio (1) 40.6 % 41.6 % 43.2 % (1) See reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in Tables 10, 11, and 13. (2) Annualized. MANAGEMENT OUTLOOK FOR 2018\nWe reaffirm our outlook for the full year 2018, the components of which are unchanged relative to a quarter ago. Compared to our full year 2017 results, our outlook for the expected full year 2018 results is as follows:\nEnd of Period Loans: increase at a percentage rate of approximately 10%. Net Interest Margin (excluding the impact of ASC 310-30 discount accretion) : between 3.65% and 3.75%. Including the impact of ASC 310-30 discount accretion, we expect our full year 2018 NIM to range between 3.70% and 3.80%. Noninterest Expense (excluding tax credit amortization & deposit premium amortization) : increase at a percentage rate in the high single digits. Provision for Credit Losses: in the range of $70 million to $80 million. Tax Items: projecting investment in tax-advantaged credits of $105 million, excluding low income housing tax credits, and associated tax credit amortization expense of $85 million. Projecting full year effective tax rate of approximately 16%. Interest Rates: our outlook incorporates the current forward rate curve; as such, it currently assumes two additional fed funds rate increases in 2018: in June and September.\nOPERATING RESULTS SUMMARY\nFirst Quarter 2018 Compared to Fourth Quarter 2017\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income totaled $326.7 million, a 2% increase from $319.7 million.\nAverage loans of $29.2 billion grew by $565.4 million, or 8% annualized, from $28.6 billion. Average deposits of $32.3 billion grew by $41.2 million, or 1% annualized, from $32.3 billion.\nNet Interest Margin\nNet interest margin expanded by 16 basis points to 3.73% from 3.57%.\nThe yield on loans expanded by 17 basis points to 4.69% from 4.52%. The yield on earning assets expanded by 23 basis points to 4.25% from 4.02%. The cost of deposits increased by six basis points to 0.49% from 0.43%. The cost of funds increased by eight basis points to 0.56% from 0.48%.\nNoninterest Income\nTotal noninterest income of $74.4 million included a $31.5 million gain on the sale of DCB branches. Excluding the impact of all gains on sales, total fees and other operating income of $38.2 million was flat relative to the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe following table presents total fees and other operating income for the three months ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017.\nQuarter Ended ($ in thousands) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Branch fees $ 10,430 $ 10,287 $ 9,924 Letters of credit fees and foreign exchange income 9,602 9,974 11,441 Ancillary loan fees and other income 5,581 6,457 4,982 Wealth management fees 2,953 2,797 4,335 Derivative fees and other income 6,690 4,737 2,506 Other fees and operating income 2,921 4,144 5,405 Total fees and other operating income $ 38,177 $ 38,396 $ 38,593 Noninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense of $169.1 million included $150.3 million of adjusted 4 noninterest expense, $17.4 million in amortization of tax credit and other investments, and $1.5 million in amortization of core deposit intangibles.\nAdjusted noninterest expense of $150.3 million decreased by $1.5 million, or 1%, linked quarter. A seasonal increase in compensation and employee benefits expense and an increase in computer software expense was more than offset by a linked quarter decline in consulting expense and a decrease in other operating expenses. The decrease in other operating expenses included a $1.9 million gain on the disposition of other real estate owned in the first quarter of 2018. The adjusted 4 efficiency ratio was 40.6% in the first quarter, compared to 41.6% in the fourth quarter.\n4 See reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in Table 11.\nTAX RELATED ITEMS\nTax expense in the first quarter of 2018 was $24.8 million and the effective tax rate was 12%, compared to a tax expense of $58.3 million and an effective tax rate of 26% in the first quarter of 2017.\nThe lower effective tax rate in 2018 reflects the new federal corporate tax rate of 21%, following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017. Tax expense in the first quarter includes the impact of accounting for stock-based compensation in accordance with Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, which reduced tax expense by $4.8 million in 2018 compared to a reduction of $4.4 million in 2017. Tax expense in the first quarter of 2018 was further reduced by the reversal of a liability related to state taxes for prior years. The reversal reduced tax expense by $3.9 million. For the full year 2018, the Company is projecting an effective tax rate of approximately 16%.\nCREDIT QUALITY\nThe allowance for loan losses totaled $297.7 million, or 1.01% of loans HFI, as of March 31, 2018, compared to $287.1 million, or 0.99% of loans HFI, as of December 31, 2017, and $263.1 million, or 0.99% of loans HFI, as of March 31, 2017.\nThe provision for credit losses recorded for the current quarter was $20.2 million, compared to $15.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, and $7.1 million for the first quarter of 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, net charge-offs were $9.4 million, or annualized 0.13% of average loans HFI. This compares to net charge-offs of $15.7 million, or annualized 0.22% of average loans HFI, for the fourth quarter of 2017, and net charge-offs of $5.4 million, or annualized 0.08% of average loans HFI, for the first quarter of 2017. Non-PCI nonperforming assets of $131.0 million as of March 31, 2018, increased from $115.1 million as of December 31, 2017, and decreased from $144.8 million as of March 31, 2017. Non-PCI nonperforming assets were equivalent to 0.35% of total assets at the end of the first quarter of 2018, compared to 0.31% at the end of the previous quarter and 0.41% at the end of the prior year quarter.\nCAPITAL STRENGTH\nCapital levels for East West continue to be strong. As of March 31, 2018, stockholders’ equity was $4.0 billion, or $27.46 per share. Tangible equity per common share was $24.07 as of March 31, 2018, an increase of 4% linked quarter and 14% year-over-year.
