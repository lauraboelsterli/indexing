    "text": "April 11, 2018 / 4:31 AM / Updated 39 minutes ago SE Asia Stocks-Most rise as Xi, Trump strike conciliatory tone on trade Reuters Staff 3 Min Read * Wall Street posts strong gains overnight * Asian shares ex-Japan edge higher on Wednesday * Indonesian shares hit one-month high By Nicole Pinto April 11 (Reuters) - Most Southeast Asian stock markets gained on Wednesday as U.S. President Donald Trump struck a conciliatory tone in response to Chinese President Xi Jinping's promise to open China's economy further, easing trade tensions. Wall Street posted strong gains overnight, boosting ex-Japan Asian shares on Wednesday, on hopes of a compromise between Washington and Beijing on trade tariffs. \"Risk sentiment picked up after President Xi's speech at Boao,\" Mizuho Bank analysts wrote in a note. \"Markets are thus latching to more conducive conditions for U.S.-China trade negotiations, but the absence of specifics in Xi's speech may not be enough to quell U.S. trade hawks.\" Indonesian shares climbed nearly 0.9 percent to an over one-month high. Astra International Tbk PT gained as much as 1.9 percent, while Bank Permata Tbk PT fell 2.5 percent. Philippine shares pared a 0.7 percent gain earlier in the session and were trading largely flat. SM Investments Corp climbed 1.5 percent to an over one-month high, while Ayala Land Inc fell 1.8 percent. Philippine exports in February fell for the first time since November 2016, down 1.8 percent to $4.66 billion from a year earlier, while imports rose 18.6 percent at $7.72 billion, data from the Philippine Statistics Authority showed. Malaysian shares rose 0.5 percent and were on track for a fifth straight session of gains. The country's industrial production rose 3 percent in February from a year earlier, supported by growth in the manufacturing and electricity generation sectors, government data showed. February's output growth was slightly below the 3.4 percent annual rise forecast in a Reuters poll. Meanwhile, China's annual consumer inflation slowed to 2.1 percent in March, lagging economists' forecasts, official data showed.
