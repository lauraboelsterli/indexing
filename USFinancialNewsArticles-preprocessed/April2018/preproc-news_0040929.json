    "text": "A wave of negative sentiment surrounding Apple has sent the company's stock negative for the year.\nAs of Friday, Apple is the worst-performing stock in the Dow Jones industrial average. Shares are down more than 1 percent from the beginning of 2018.\nIt fell after Friday morning after Morgan Stanley predicted that the company's iPhone sales will fall nearly 10 million below Wall Street's forecast. \nAnother analyst predicted that the company's iPhone X will be killed off this year after Apple's suppliers reported inventory issues and poor earnings -- though not all analysts agree with that assessment.\nApple did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment.",
