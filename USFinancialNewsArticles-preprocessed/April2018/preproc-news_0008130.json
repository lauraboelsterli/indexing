    "text": "April 6, 2018 / 5:19 PM / in an hour Pelosi calls for EPA chief Pruitt to resign as scandal grows Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in the House of Representatives, on Friday called for Scott Pruitt to resign as head of the Environmental Protection Agency amid a growing scandal involving a condo he rented at well-below-market rates from a lobbyist’s wife as well as his spending of public money. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi speaks at a news conference about the omnibus spending bill moving through Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 22, 2018. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein \nNancy Pelosi said that Pruitt’s “tenure has been a part of the Trump administration’s culture of corruption, cronyism and incompetence.” \n“Pruitt must resign,” she said in a statement.
