    "text": "April 11, 2018 / 9:05 AM / Updated 2 hours ago U.S. lawmakers quiz Trump's consumer chief over lack of action Katanga Johnson 3 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic lawmakers asked U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau chief Mick Mulvaney on Wednesday why he has not issued any sanctions during his five months at the agency.

REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein \nPresident Donald Trump in November tapped Mulvaney, already White House budget chief, to also serve as interim head of the agency conceived to stamp out abusive lending after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. \n“Are you telling me that every single financial institution in America has suddenly snapped into full compliance with every single consumer financial law?” asked Democratic Representative Carolyn Maloney. \nMulvaney, a former Republican congressman, has said that the agency overstepped its reach in the past and that he aims to help fulfill Trump’s promise to cut regulations for industry. \nIn his first appearance as CFPB head before the Republican-controlled Congress, Mulvaney said that he has brought charges for abusive lending but continued to describe his vision for scaling back the reach of the independent agency.

There, he is likely to be further confronted by Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has repeatedly questioned the agency’s current direction.
