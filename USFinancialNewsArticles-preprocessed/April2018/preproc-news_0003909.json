Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov speaks during a meeting with his Bangladeshi counterpart Abul Hassan Mahmud Ali in Moscow, Russia April 2, 2018. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin \nIn times of cold war there were some rules, but now Britain and the United States had dropped all propriety and were playing childrenâ€™s games, he said. \nRussia has denied responsibility for the March 4 attack on ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the English city of Salisbury.
