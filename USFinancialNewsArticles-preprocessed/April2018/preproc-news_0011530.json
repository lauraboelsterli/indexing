    "text": "LONDON, April 6 (Reuters) - Facebook's Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer will answer questions from British lawmakers on the social media giant's recent data scandal on April 26, a parliamentary committee said on Friday.\nFacebook Inc said on Wednesday the personal information of up to 87 million users, mostly in the United States, may have been improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, up from a previous estimates.\nLawmakers had asked Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg or another senior Facebook executive to explain to a parliamentary committee how the data got into Cambridge Analytica's hands. Committee chair Damien Collins has said it was \"astonishing\" that Zuckerberg was not prepared to answer questions himself.\nThe Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee said it would also hear from former Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix on April 18, his second hearing, as well as from Aleksandr Kogan, a research associate at the centre of the scandal, on 24 April.
