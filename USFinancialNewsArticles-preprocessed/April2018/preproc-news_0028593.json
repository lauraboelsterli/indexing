Coeure suggested previously that the role of rates guidance could be strengthened, but did not give specifics.\nOngoing concerns of a prolonged trade dispute between the United States and China are also keeping markets on edge.\nChina’s Commerce Ministry said on Thursday trade negotiations with the United States would be impossible as Washington’s attempts at dialogue were not sincere, and vowed to retaliate should Trump escalate current tensions.\nLater in the day, Italy will hold of a sale of bonds maturing in 2021, 2025, 2038, and 2038 for over 7 billion euros.\nItalian debt has outperformed its peers, with the premium investors demand to hold Italian 10-year bonds over top-rated German debt currently at 131 basis points, close to its tightest levels since 2016.\nItalian President Sergio Mattarella is scheduled to hold further talks on Thursday and Friday to try stitch together a new government after an inconclusive March 4 election.
