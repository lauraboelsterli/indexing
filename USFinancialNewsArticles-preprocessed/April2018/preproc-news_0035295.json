Staff members work at the booth of Royal Dutch Shell at Gastech, the world's biggest expo for the gas industry, in Chiba, Japan, April 4, 2017. REUTERS/Toru Hanai \nEgypt is looking to production from recently discovered fields to halt energy imports by 2019. \nA petroleum ministry official said last month that new production at Shell’s West Nile Delta field 9B is expected to reach 350-400 million cubic feet per day by 2019. \nSeparately, production from the first 3 wells in the field is set to begin in the 2018-2019 fiscal year. \nThe field is owned by Egypt’s General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC), Malaysia’s Petronas [PETRA.UL] and Shell.
