    "text": "ERIE, Pa., April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Erie Indemnity Company (NASDAQ: ERIE) today announced financial results for the quarter ending March 31, 2018. Net income was $65.8 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $47.9 million, or $0.91 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\n1Q 2018\n(dollars in thousands)\n1Q'18\n1Q'17\nOperating income\n$\n77,567\n$\n66,940\nInvestment income\n6,163\n6,589\nInterest expense and other, net\n509\n575\nIncome before income taxes\n83,221\n72,954\nIncome tax expense\n17,463\n25,078\nNet income\n$\n65,758\n$\n47,876\n1Q 2018 Highlights\nOperating income before taxes increased $10.6 million, or 15.9 percent, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, as the growth in total operating revenue outpaced the growth in total operating expenses.\nManagement fee revenue - policy issuance and renewal services increased $13.9 million, or 3.6 percent, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017. Management fee revenue allocated to administrative services was $13.1 million in the first quarter of 2018. No management fee revenue was allocated to administrative services in the first quarter of 2017. Cost of operations - policy issuance and renewal services Commissions increased $13.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, as a result of the 7.0 percent increase in direct and assumed premiums written by the Exchange. Non-commission expense increased $2.6 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. Underwriting and policy processing costs increased $3.2 million primarily due to increased personnel costs and underwriting report costs. Information technology costs decreased $0.8 million primarily due to lower professional fees, somewhat offset by higher personnel costs. Sales and advertising costs increased $1.2 million primarily due to increased personnel and advertising costs. Customer service costs increased $1.6 million primarily due to increased personnel costs and credit card processing fees. Administrative and other expenses decreased $2.5 million driven by a decrease in long-term incentive plan cost due to a decrease in the company stock price during the first quarter of 2018 compared to an increase in the company stock price during the first quarter of 2017. Personnel costs in all expense categories were impacted by additional bonuses of approximately $4.8 million awarded to all employees as a result of tax savings realized from the lower corporate income tax rate that became effective January 1, 2018. The administrative services reimbursement revenue and corresponding cost of operations impact both total operating revenue and total operating expenses by $146.0 million, but have no net impact on operating income.\nIncome from investments before taxes totaled $6.2 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $6.6 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net investment income was $6.8 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $6.0 million in the first quarter of 2017, while net realized losses on investments were $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to net realized gains of $0.5 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nIncome tax expense decreased by $11.4 million due the lower income tax rate of 21% that became effective January 1, 2018, partially offset by an increase in deferred tax expense.\nWebcast Information\nIndemnity has scheduled a conference call and live audio broadcast on the Web for 10:00 AM ET on April 27, 2018.
