    "text": "Revenue of $65.9 Million\nEarnings Per Share of $1.07\nWESTWOOD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Chase Corporation (NYSE American: CCF), a global specialty chemicals company that is a leading manufacturer of protective materials for high-reliability applications, today announced financial results for the quarter ended February 28, 2018, its second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nHIGHLIGHTS – Q2 2018 vs. Q2 2017\nGAAP Financials\nRevenue of $65.88 million, up $8.57 million, or 15%, from $57.31 million Operating income of $11.35 million, down $1.56 million, or 12%, from $12.91 million Net income of $10.12 million, up $1.74 million, or 21%, from $8.38 million Earnings per diluted share (“EPS”) of $1.07, up $0.18, or 20%, from $0.89\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures *\nAdjusted diluted EPS of $1.10, up $0.23, or 26%, from $0.87 EBITDA of $16.46 million, down $0.12 million, or 1%, from $16.59 million Adjusted EBITDA of $17.30 million, up $0.76 million, or 5%, from $16.54 million\nHIGHLIGHTS – YTD Q2 2018 vs. YTD Q2 2017\nGAAP Financials\nRevenue of $127.79 million, up $9.13 million, or 8%, from $118.67 million Operating income of $24.32 million, down $2.30 million, or 9%, from $26.61 million Net income of $18.44 million, down $0.31 million, or 2%, from $18.75 million EPS of $1.95, down $0.04, or 2%, from $1.99\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures *\nAdjusted diluted EPS of $1.97, up $0.08, or 4%, from $1.89 EBITDA of $32.68 million, down $2.32 million, or 7%, from $34.99 million Adjusted EBITDA of $33.51 million, down $1.44 million, or 4%, from $34.96 million\n* Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to Chase’s GAAP financial results are included at the end of this release. See also “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\nAdam P. Chase, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “The Zappa Stewart acquisition was a key contributor in the second fiscal quarter, which is traditionally our weakest. The acquisition provided a revenue boost, but margins were lower than we anticipate on a going-forward basis because of the $1.53 million non-cash, one-time inventory step-up charge we took during the quarter (2.8% gross margin impact for Industrial Materials for the quarter). The Zappa Stewart transaction demonstrates our commitment to this important inorganic strategic element in achieving our long-term growth goals. Another inorganic item in the quarter that helped our net income was the sale of a license for composite manufacturing technology to an outside party. We also secured a royalty agreement with the sale, establishing a future revenue stream.\n“A less favorable sales mix along with continued inflationary pressure on inputs eroded gross margins when compared to prior quarters. Uncertainty over tariffs and impact on raw material costs and sales pricing will remain a challenge and we continue to act with recovery tactics that lag margin compression effects reflected in our results. Structural cost reductions will be implemented to reduce excess capacity and overhead.”\nIndustrial Materials:\nFor the Three Months Ended February 28, For the Six Months Ended February 28, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Revenue $ 55,267 $ 47,392 $ 105,252 $ 96,416 Cost of products and services sold 35,268 27,525 65,732 56,017 Gross Margin $ 19,999 $ 19,867 $ 39,520 $ 40,399 Gross Margin % ** 36% 42% 38% 42% **Adjusted for inventory step up the GM% would be 39% for both the three- and six-month periods ended February 28, 2018\nMr. Chase continued, “The Industrial Materials segment revenue, which included $3.53 million in sales from our newly acquired superabsorbent polymers business, Zappa Stewart, increased over the prior year. Our pulling and detection and electronic and industrial coatings product lines continued their trends of organic growth. Throughout the first half of fiscal 2018, pulling and detection has seen increased demand from customers in the utility and telecommunication industries for both infrastructure build and large-scale repair projects. Electronic and industrial coatings’ sales increased on expanding automotive and appliance manufacturing industries. Our cable materials product line was again down for the quarter, but on a less sharp decline than seen in our first quarter.”\nConstruction Materials:\nFor the Three Months Ended February 28, For the Six Months Ended February 28, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Revenue $ 10,608 $ 9,916 $ 22,540 $ 22,249 Cost of products and services sold 6,723 5,333 13,154 12,130 Gross Margin $ 3,885 $ 4,583 $ 9,386 $ 10,119 Gross Margin % 37% 46% 42% 45% “Our Construction Materials segment reversed the unfavorable sales trend seen in the first quarter, resulting in revenue increases over both the prior year periods” noted Mr. Chase. “Sales of both our domestically-produced oil and gas pipeline and U.K.-produced water and waste water pipeline products saw increases over the prior year benefiting from the rising price of oil and an easing of credit in the Middle East. However, our bridge and highway products, which had a solid first quarter, did not surpass the prior year’s sales in the second quarter, and an overall unfavorable product mix affected the segment’s bottom line results. Market-addressing pricing tactics have been implemented, and we have effectively passed on cost increases in this segment and expect to respond as needed. We stand poised to excel in the second half of the year, our historically better sales period, as seasonal infrastructure build and repair work ramp up.”\nOther matters affecting financial results\nKenneth J. Feroldi, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, added, “Our effective tax rates for the quarter and year-to-date periods were significantly impacted by two factors: The passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) in December 2017, and our early adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 at the beginning of the prior year.\n“The Tax Act lowered our rate by a net 12.6 percentage points for Q2 from our Q1 rate, the result of three important factors:\nDiscrete transitional tax expenses totaling $1.26 million for the provisional remeasurement of balance sheet tax items relating to net deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions (FIN 48) A one-time transitional tax benefit of $0.71 million for the remeasurement of Foreign Tax Earnings assertion (APB 23) under the new Toll Charge scheme Application of the blended tax rate for Q2 and adjustment for the higher rate used in Q1 before enactment\n“In addition, we recognized a discrete tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense of $0.98 million. This item, which is related to our application of ASU No. 2016-09 and was not related to the Tax Act, lowered our effective tax rate in Q2 a further 8.3 percentage points.\n“These non-recurring expenses and benefits aside, Chase anticipates the lasting and ongoing changes brought about by the Tax Act will result in a lower overall effective tax rate than that historically experienced by the Company. Chase’s Federal statutory rate for fiscal 2018 is now based on a combination of four months of operations under the old 35% corporate income tax rate, and eight months at the new 21% rate, yielding a 25.7% blended Federal rate. Going forward, in fiscal 2019 and beyond, we expect our all-in rate to be approximately 25%, depending on state income tax impact as states adjust to the new Federal rate.\n“Due to the changes in the handling of foreign earnings and the new Toll Tax on those earnings, we have begun repatriating cash held in our U.K. affiliates. This cash will be used to pay down debt created with the recent acquisition of Zappa Stewart.\n“Additionally, the negative foreign currency transactional trend observed earlier in our fiscal year continued into Q2. This trend’s negative effects are amplified when compared to the gains recognized within Other income (expense) in the prior year-to-date period, resulting in a year-to-date $1.04 million swing from gain to loss. Current year losses result from the strengthening British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar. This affects our U.K.-based operations, who make U.S. dollar-denominated sales into the Middle East.”\nMr. Chase also commented, \"Intelligently growing the business and reestablishing the superior margins obtained in the prior period through our core strategies remains (and will remain) our focus.\n“Our balance sheet remains strong. As of February 28, 2018, the Company’s cash on hand was $44.14 million and our $150 million revolving credit facility had $95 million of additional availability. Given our cash balance, profitable results and the untapped portion of our revolving credit facility, we remain amply funded to support both organic and inorganic growth initiatives.”\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s financial results for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 and 2017.\nFor the Three Months Ended February 28, For the Six Months Ended February 28, All figures in thousands, except per share figures 2018 2017 2018 2017 Revenue $ 65,875 $ 57,308 $ 127,792 $ 118,665 Costs and Expenses Cost of products and services sold 41,991 32,858 78,886 68,147 Selling, general and administrative expenses 12,138 11,518 24,197 23,270 Acquisition-related costs 393 — 393 584 Exit costs related to idle facility — 23 — 50 Operating income 11,353 12,909 24,316 26,614 Interest expense (440 ) (307 ) (485 ) (553 ) Gain on sale of real estate — 68 — 860 Gain on sale of license 1,085 — 1,085 — Other income (expense) (258 ) (27 ) (577 ) 372 Income before income taxes 11,740 12,643 24,339 27,293 Income taxes 1,618 4,260 5,902 8,547 Net income $ 10,122 $ 8,383 $ 18,437 $ 18,746 Net income per diluted share $ 1.07 $ 0.89 $ 1.95 $ 1.99 Weighted average diluted shares outstanding 9,329 9,360 9,357 9,336 Reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA Net income $ 10,122 $ 8,383 $ 18,437 $ 18,746 Interest expense 440 307 485 553 Income taxes 1,618 4,260 5,902 8,547 Depreciation expense 1,364 1,305 2,618 2,640 Amortization expense 2,919 2,330 5,233 4,506 EBITDA $ 16,463 $ 16,585 $ 32,675 $ 34,992 Cost of sale of inventory step-up 1,530 — 1,530 190 Acquisition-related costs 393 — 393 584 Gain on sale of license (1,085 ) — (1,085 ) — Exit costs related to idle facility — 23 — 50 Gain on sale of real estate — (68 ) — (860 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 17,301 $ 16,540 $ 33,513 $ 34,956 Reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income Net income $ 10,122 $ 8,383 $ 18,437 $ 18,746 Transitional impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, net 548 — 548 — Excess tax benefit related to ASU No. 2016-09 (977 ) (74 ) (977 ) (868 ) Cost of sale of inventory step-up 1,530 — 1,530 190 Acquisition-related costs 393 — 393 584 Gain on sale of license (1,085 ) — (1,085 ) — Exit costs related to idle facility — 23 — 50 Gain on sale of real estate — (68 ) — (860 ) Income taxes *** (215 ) 16 (215 ) 13 Adjusted net income $ 10,316 $ 8,280 $ 18,631 $ 17,855 Adjusted net income per diluted share (Adjusted diluted EPS) $ 1.10 $ 0.87 $ 1.97 $ 1.89 ***For the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, represents the aggregate tax-effect assuming a 25.7% tax rate for the items impacting pre-tax income, which is our estimated U.S. statutory Federal tax rate for fiscal year 2018 following the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017.
