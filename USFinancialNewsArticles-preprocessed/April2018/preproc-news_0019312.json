    "text": "(Recasts, updates prices, adds fresh comments)\nBy Claire Milhench\nLONDON, A spike in tension between Russia and the United States sent the rouble to its weakest since November 2016 on Wednesday, while Turkey’s lira plumbed another record low and emerging stocks slipped as risk appetite soured.\nMSCI’s benchmark emerging stocks index fell 0.2 percent with emerging Europe a sea of red, offsetting a stronger performance earlier in Asia.\nThe mood turned more bearish across emerging markets after U.S. President Donald Trump warned Russia of imminent military action in Syria over a suspected poison gas attack, lambasting Moscow for standing by Syrian President Bashar Assad.\n“Trump has upped the stakes and the tensions, and caused fears to mount,” said William Jackson, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics. This caused another leg down in both the rouble and the lira, and turned into a broader sell off across emerging market assets, he said.\nThe rouble extended losses, tumbling 2.5 percent, having fallen almost 12 percent since Friday when the U.S. levied sanctions against Russian businessmen and their companies to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.\n“(The rouble) is being driven by headline risk - investors don’t know what’s next,” said Kiran Kowshik, a strategist at UniCredit.\nHe added that investors were overweight Russian assets, with holdings of OFZ Treasury bonds by non-residents at well over 30 percent. “That’s the highest in years, and I think a lot of that’s unhedged. So it makes sense you will see further weakness in the rouble in the near term.”\nRussian credit default swaps rose to 162 basis points (bps) according to IHS Markit data, up 11 bps from Tuesday’s close to the highest since early August 2017.\nThe average yield spread of Russian sovereign bonds over safe haven U.S. Treasuries on the JPMorgan EMBI Global Diversified index also rose 7 bps to 242 bps.\nThe Turkish lira fell 1.7 percent to another record low, while five-year credit default swaps jumped to a fresh 4-1/2 month high of 219 bps, up 10 bps from Tuesday’s close according to IHS Markit. Turkish stocks also tumbled 2.6 percent to four-month lows.\nKowshik said UniCredit had been consistently bearish on the lira, as inflation was failing to moderate as much as anticipated and it was not clear if the central bank would respond. The tensions between Russia and the U.S. over Syria - which shares a border with Turkey - have added to the woes.\nAnalysts at ING said the current account deficit, which came in at $4.152 billion in February, made the currency vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment.\nThe Kazakh tenge lost another 1 percent to hit a three-month low, following the rouble down.\nThe Polish zloty dipped from five-week highs versus the euro, with the central bank holding rates at 1.5 percent as expected. Jackson said the bank was likely to remain dovish as inflation had been weak.\nThe weak performance in Europe was in contrast to the more bouyant Asian session. Chinese mainland shares and Hong Kong stocks climbed around 0.5 percent after Beijing pledged to allow foreign firms to compete on an equal footing with domestic companies in the financial sector.\nThe gains came despite data showing that factory gate prices cooled to a 17-month low in March, while consumer prices eased from February’s multi-year high as the booming demand spurred by the Lunar New Year holiday receded.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) Emerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg\non year\nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1172.84 -2.48 -0.21 +1.24\nCzech Rep 1124.05 -0.97 -0.09 +4.26\nPoland 2260.64 -14.17 -0.62 -8.15\nHungary 37914.36 +31.94 +0.08 -3.72\nRomania 8817.74 -24.00 -0.27 +13.72\nGreece 797.75 -12.79 -1.58 -0.58\nRussia 1063.54 -27.25 -2.50 -7.87\nSouth Africa 49552.43 -483.64 -0.97 -5.67\nTurkey 07969.33 -2743.36 -2.48 -6.38\nChina 3208.32 +17.99 +0.56 -2.99\nIndia 33940.44 +60.19 +0.18 -0.34\nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local\nclose currency currency\n% change % change\nin 2018\nCzech Rep 25.31 25.30 -0.03 +0.87\nPoland 4.19 4.19 -0.12 -0.38\nHungary 311.47 311.14 -0.11 -0.30\nRomania 4.66 4.65 -0.17 +0.32\nSerbia 118.11 118.11 +0.00 +0.25\nRussia 64.50 63.01 -2.30 -10.60\nKazakhstan 331.06 327.45 -1.09 +0.53\nUkraine 25.92 25.94 +0.10 +8.61\nSouth Africa 12.06 12.03 -0.24 +2.47\nKenya 100.85 101.00 +0.15 +2.23\nIsrael 3.51 3.50 -0.44 -1.05\nTurkey 4.16 4.11 -1.06 -8.81\nChina 6.28 6.28 -0.03 +3.58\nIndia 65.26 64.94 -0.48 -2.18\nBrazil 3.42 3.41 -0.27 -3.10\nMexico 18.27 18.26 -0.02 +7.57\nDebt Index Strip Spd Chg %Rtn Index\nSov’gn Debt EMBIG 324 4 .07 7 93.27 1\nReporting by Claire Milhench Editing by Alison Williams\n ",
