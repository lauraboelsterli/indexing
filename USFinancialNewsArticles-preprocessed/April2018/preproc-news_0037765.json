    "text": "April 17, 2018 / 7:32 PM / Updated 32 minutes ago Icahn, Deason suggest monetizing Xerox assets over Fujifilm merger Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nApril 17 (Reuters) - Top Xerox Corp shareholders Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason on Tuesday suggested alternatives to the printer maker’s proposed merger with Japan’s Fujifilm , including a plan for the company to monetize some assets. \nThe suggestions include removing Xerox’s current management and monetizing the company’s “untapped” intellectual property in digital printing and other businesses. \nIcahn and Deason, who control a combined 15 percent of Xerox, have been trying to stop Fujifilm from buying Xerox in a $6.1 billion deal.
