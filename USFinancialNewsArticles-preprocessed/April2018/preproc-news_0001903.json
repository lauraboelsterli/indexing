The S&P 500 fell back into correction Monday as technology led the market lower, with names like Amazon and Netflix both down more than 5 percent. Universal History Archive | Getty Images Crowds gather outside the New York Stock Exchange during the Wall Street crash in 1929. \nThe stock market's start to the second quarter was its worst since the Great Depression. \nWith the S&P 500 closing down more than 2.2 percent Monday, the broad market index clinched its worst start to April since 1932, according to Bespoke Investment Group. \nThe index also closed below its 200-day moving average – a key technical level – for the first time since June 2016, 442 straight days. \n\"Based on recent market action, the bears clearly have control right now,\" Bespoke Co-Founder Justin Walters wrote in an email. \"The path of least resistance is lower until something comes along to reverse that trend.\" \nThe S&P 500 fell back into correction territory Monday as technology led the market lower, with names like Amazon and Netflix both down more than 5 percent. Intel fell about 8.5 percent after Bloomberg reported that Apple will no longer use its semiconductor chips as early as 2020. \nThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.9 percent – or 458 points – as China's retaliatory tariffs against U.S. agricultural goods stoked fears of a global trade war. Dow stocks with large international markets (and thus exposed to global tariffs) such as Boeing and 3M led decliners. ",
