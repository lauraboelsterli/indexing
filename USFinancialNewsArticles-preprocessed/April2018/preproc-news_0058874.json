Seacoast reported adjusted net income 1 of $19.3 million, or $0.40 per share, representing an 88% or $9.0 million increase year-over-year.\nFor the first quarter 2018, return on average tangible assets was 1.34%, return on average tangible shareholders’ equity was 14.4%, and the efficiency ratio was 57.8%, compared to 0.97%, 10.7% and 64.0%, respectively, in the prior quarter and 0.74%, 8.8%, and 71.1%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted return on average tangible assets 1 was 1.38%, adjusted return on average tangible shareholders’ equity 1 was 14.8%, and the adjusted efficiency ratio 1 was 57.1%, compared to 1.23%, 13.5%, and 52.6%, respectively, in the prior quarter, and 0.90%, 10.7%, and 64.7%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2017.\nDennis S. Hudson, III, Seacoast’s Chairman and CEO, said “Our strong financial and operating performance laid the foundation for driving sustained earnings growth throughout 2018 and beyond. We delivered robust deposit growth that supported margin expansion and achieved higher revenue across all of our business lines. Further, our ongoing commitment to leverage innovative data analytics has not only proven to be a valuable cost effective tool to better service our customers but has also supported a record quarter of consumer and small business originations.”\nHudson added, “Our balanced growth strategy, a combination of organic growth and acquisitions, continues to create value for shareholders. We have successfully completed the integration and cost rationalization of all three of our recent acquisitions, positioning Seacoast for further expansion in some of Florida’s largest and fastest growing markets.”\nCharles M. Shaffer, Seacoast’s Chief Financial Officer, said, “Our quarterly results demonstrate our ability to balance a disciplined approach to credit, liquidity and expense management, while achieving strong organic growth. This led to higher shareholder returns, underscored by the increase in tangible book value per share to $11.39. With a loan-to-deposit ratio of 84% and a ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets of 9.3%, our balance sheet enables us the flexibility to be prudent yet opportunistic in funding organic growth initiatives as well as accretive acquisitions.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nIncome Statement\nNet income was $18.0 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, compared to $13.0 million or $0.28 for the prior quarter and $7.9 million or $0.20 for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted net income 1 was $19.3 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, compared to $17.3 million or $0.37 for the prior quarter and $10.3 million or $0.26 for the first quarter of 2017.\nNet revenues were $62.1 million, a decrease of $12.8 million or 17% compared to the prior quarter, and an increase of $14.0 million or 29% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Prior quarter results include a $15.2 million gain on the sale of Visa Class B stock. Adjusted revenues 1 were $62.2 million, an increase of $2.6 million, or 4%, from the prior quarter and an increase of $14.1 million, or 29% from the first quarter of 2017.\nNet interest income totaled $49.8 million, an increase of $1.5 million or 3% from the prior quarter and an increase of $11.6 million or 30% from the first quarter of 2017.\nNet interest margin was 3.80% in the current quarter compared to 3.71% in the prior quarter and 3.63% in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in the current quarter reflects the positive impact on loans and securities of increases in benchmark interest rates, higher add-on rates for new loan production, and growth in demand deposits. Partially offsetting, the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased 6 basis points. Noninterest income totaled $12.3 million, a decrease of $14.3 million or 54% compared to the prior quarter and an increase of $2.4 million or 24% from the first quarter of 2017. Results in the fourth quarter of 2017 included a $15.2 million gain on the sale of Visa Class B stock. Adjusted noninterest income 1 totaled $12.4 million for the quarter, an increase of $1.0 million or 9% compared to prior quarter and an increase of $2.5 million or 25% from the first quarter of 2017. During the quarter, growth across our businesses and markets resulted in improvements in nearly every category. Other income benefited from continued progress by our SBA lending group, resulting in recognized gains on sale of $0.7 million in the quarter, an increase of $0.5 million from the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe provision for loan losses was $1.1 million, compared to $2.3 million in the prior quarter and $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting continuing positive credit trends.\nNoninterest expense was $37.2 million compared to $39.2 million in the prior quarter and $34.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. In the prior quarter, noninterest expense included a favorable adjustment of $2.0 million of performance related incentives, and charges totaling $6.8 million associated with the fourth-quarter bank acquisitions. Adjusted noninterest expense 1 was $35.7 million compared to $31.4 million in the prior quarter, and $30.9 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase quarter over quarter in adjusted noninterest expense 1 is the result of the full impact of the two acquisitions, normalized compensation accruals, and the return of seasonal 401k and payroll tax expenses.\nSeacoast recorded $5.8 million in income tax expense in the current quarter, compared to $20.4 million in the prior quarter and $4.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate of 24.3% in the current quarter reflects the positive impact of the new lower corporate tax rate, offset by the effect of an additional $0.3 million write down of deferred tax assets arising from measurement period adjustments on a prior year bank acquisition. The write down of these assets in the current quarter increased the effective tax rate by 1.1%. The efficiency ratio was 57.8% compared to 64.0% in the prior quarter and 71.1% in the first quarter of 2017. The adjusted efficiency ratio 1 was 57.1% compared to 52.6% in the prior quarter and 64.7% in the first quarter of 2017.\nBalance Sheet\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had total assets of $5.9 billion and total shareholders' equity of $701.9 million. Book value per share was $14.94 and tangible book value per share was $11.39, compared to $14.70 and $11.15, respectively, at December 31, 2017 and $12.34 and $10.41, respectively, at March 31, 2017. Excluding the $7.9 million decline in accumulated other comprehensive income during the quarter, the result of the impact of higher interest rates on available for sale securities, tangible book value per share would have been $11.56.\nNet loans totaled $3.9 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $78.8 million or 8% annualized in the current quarter, and an increase of $920 million or 31% from March 31, 2017. Excluding the acquisitions in 2017, loans increased $265 million or 9% from March 31, 2017. Consumer and small business originations reached a record $98.4 million. Closed residential loans retained were $79.1 million, an increase of 5% from the prior quarter. Commercial originations were $122.1 million. We continue to prudently manage commercial real estate exposure. Construction and land development and commercial real estate loans remain well below regulatory guidance with construction and land development at 63% and commercial real estate at 206% of total risk based capital, respectively.\nPipelines (loans in underwriting and approval or approved and not yet closed) have rebounded from the impact of the fall hurricane season. At March 31, 2018, pipelines were $50.4 million in consumer and small business, $70.8 million in residential, and $122.7 million in commercial. Consumer and small business pipelines were higher by $11.5 million, or 30%, compared to the prior quarter. Residential pipelines were higher by $21.9 million, or 45%, from prior quarter. Commercial pipelines increased by $3.8 million, or 3%, from prior quarter.\nTotal deposits were $4.7 billion as of March 31, 2018, an increase of $127 million, or 11% annualized in the current quarter, and an increase of $1.0 billion, or 28%, from March 31, 2017. Since March 31, 2017, interest bearing deposits (interest bearing demand, savings and money markets deposits) increased $433 million, or 21%, to $2.5 billion, noninterest bearing demand deposits increased $263 million, or 21%, to $1.5 billion, and CDs increased $345 million, or 86%, to $743 million. Excluding acquired deposits, noninterest bearing deposits increased 8% and total deposits increased 5% compared to March 31, 2017. The Company’s balance sheet continues to be primarily core deposit funded. Core customer funding was $4.1 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $4.0 billion at December 31, 2017 and $3.5 billion at March 31, 2017. Overall cost of deposits remains attractive at 0.33%.\nFirst quarter return on average tangible assets (ROTA) was 1.34%, compared to 0.97% in the prior quarter and 0.74% in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted ROTA 1 was 1.38% compared to 1.23% in the prior quarter and 0.90% in the first quarter of 2017.\nCapital\nFirst quarter return on average tangible common equity (ROTCE) was 14.4%, compared to 10.7% in the prior quarter and 8.8% in the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted ROTCE 1 was 14.8% compared to 13.5% in the prior quarter and 10.7% in the first quarter of 2017. The common equity tier 1 capital ratio (CET1) was 12.7%, total capital ratio was 15.0% and the tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.7% at March 31, 2018. Tangible common equity to tangible assets was 9.3% at March 31, 2018, compared to 9.3% at December 31, 2017, and 9.0% at March 31, 2017.\nAsset Quality\nNonperforming loans to total loans outstanding was 0.50% at March 31, 2018, 0.51% at December 31, 2017, and 0.57% at March 31, 2017. Nonperforming assets to total assets was 0.50% at March 31, 2018, 0.47% at December 31, 2017 and 0.52% at March 31, 2017. Of the $29.6 million in nonperforming assets, $3.1 million related to four closed branch properties held as REO. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.72% at March 31, 2018, 0.71% at December 31, 2017, and 0.83% at March 31, 2017. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to non-acquired loans was 0.90% at March 31, 2018, 0.90% at December 31, 2017, and 0.95% at March 31, 2017. Net charges offs were near zero for the current quarter, reflecting continued strong credit trends.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (Unaudited) (Amounts in thousands except per share data) Quarterly Trends 1Q'18 4Q'17 3Q'17 2Q'17 1Q'17 Selected Balance Sheet Data: Total Assets $ 5,903,101 $ 5,810,129 $ 5,340,413 $ 5,281,295 $ 4,769,775 Gross Loans 3,897,125 3,817,377 3,384,991 3,330,075 2,973,759 Total Deposits 4,719,543 4,592,720 4,112,600 3,975,458 3,678,645 Performance Measures: Net Income 18,027 13,047 14,216 7,676 7,926 Net Interest Margin 3.80 % 3.71 % 3.74 % 3.84 % 3.63 % Average Diluted Shares Outstanding 47,688 46,473 43,792 43,556 39,499 Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) $ 0.38 $ 0.28 $ 0.32 $ 0.18 $ 0.20 Return on (annualized): Average Assets (ROA) 1.25 % 0.91 % 1.06 % 0.61 % 0.68 % Average Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE) 14.41 10.69 12.45 7.25 8.77 Efficiency Ratio 57.80 64.00 58.90 73.90 71.10 Adjusted Operating Measures 1 : Adjusted Net Income $ 19,298 $ 17,261 $ 15,145 $ 12,665 $ 10,270 Adjusted Diluted EPS 0.40 0.37 0.35 0.29 0.26 Adjusted ROTA 1.38 % 1.23 % 1.16 % 1.02 % 0.90 % Adjusted ROTCE 14.8 13.5 12.8 11.2 10.7 Adjusted Efficiency Ratio 57.1 52.6 57.7 61.2 64.7 Adjusted Noninterest Expenses as a Percent of Average Tangible Assets 2.55 2.24 2.50 2.73 2.71 Other Data Market capitalization 2 $ 1,243,644 $ 1,182,796 $ 1,039,506 $ 1,047,361 $ 976,368 Full-time equivalent employees 814 805 762 759 743 Number of ATMs 86 85 76 76 76 Full service banking offices 49 51 45 45 46 Registered online users 91,636 83,881 78,880 75,394 71,385 Registered mobile devices 65,336 62,516 58,032 55,013 50,729 1 Non-GAAP measure, see “Explanation of Certain Unaudited Non-GAAP Financial Measures” 2 Common shares outstanding multiplied by closing bid price on last day of each period\nVision 2020\nWe are confident in our ability to achieve our Vision 2020 targets announced at our Investor Day in February of 2017. The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on December 22, 2017 should have a significant positive impact on the United States economy and growth in our Florida markets. This clearly creates an opportunity for us to accelerate the achievement of our Vision 2020 objectives. As the impact of this new legislation on our operating markets materializes, we will provide further updates on our progress and updated objectives.\nVision 2020 Targets Return on Tangible Assets 1.30%+ Return on Tangible Common Equity 16%+ Efficiency Ratio Below 50%\nFirst Quarter Strategic Highlights\nModernizing How We Sell\nSmall Business Administration (SBA) activity saw significant growth from the prior year, driven by streamlined processes and a new technology partnership, resulting in $0.7 million in noninterest income in the current quarter. We expect continued growth in this segment over the remainder of the year. Late last year Seacoast Wealth Management migrated its third-party brokerage platform to an industry leading provider. The shift will provide better tools, sales support, and technology. In early 2016, we invested in a team of wealth management professionals in the Central Florida market. This team has contributed to originations of $120 million in new assets under management in the last twelve months, resulting in a record quarter for trust fee income. In 2018 we’ll further connect our Bankers with insights to better meet customer needs. We’ll make enhancements to our proprietary Connections portal which provides our Bankers with greater access to customer service/activity timelines and opportunities to better meet customer needs and improve engagement. We’re focused on continuing to improve revenue per customer. Since we began applying our proprietary methodology in mid-2015, risk adjusted revenue per customer has grown by 30%. These results were achieved by using analytics and marketing automation combined with improved sales execution to improve customer engagement. This methodology has allowed us to focus our prospecting and relationship deepening efforts on those customers with the largest economic opportunity. Our focus to date has been consumer and small business segments. Our objective in 2018 is to expand to other business units within the franchise.\nLowering Our Cost to Serve\nWe consolidated two recently-acquired banking center locations in the first quarter 2018, consistent with our strategy of reducing our footprint to provide funding for technology investments needed to meet the evolving demands of our customers. We continue to invest in our Florida call center to support our growth strategy and our 24/7 customer service model. Last year, we migrated operations to the Orlando area; and in 2018, we expect to modernize our software platform to improve our self-serve options for customers and streamline manual processes for associates.\nDriving Improvements in How Our Business Operates\nIn 2017, we outsourced a portion of our mortgage fulfillment and processing services to create greater scalability. This capability was demonstrated in the first quarter during which we generated near record mortgage originations while maintaining cycle times. We are focused on creating more efficient fulfillment and customer service processes, especially in Commercial Banking, by investing in equipment and software upgrades to ensure data quality and our ability to scale efficiently, and improving our analytics and reporting services, resulting in greater operating leverage.\nScaling and Evolving Our Culture\nIn February, we welcomed Amie Seymour to Seacoast as EVP, Chief Technology Officer. Amie’s focus is the continued development and execution of the Bank’s overall technology roadmap. Prior to joining Seacoast, Amie worked for Raymond James Financial as Vice President of Information Technology and Chief of Staff to the Chief Information Officer. Prior, Amie was the Chief Information Officer for a global digital consumer finance company, DFC Global, where she was instrumental in integrating various acquired companies and supporting lending businesses in eight countries. Prior to DFC Global, she served at Capital One Financial Corporation leading development of the first mobile application and was a founding member of the innovation lab.\nOTHER INFORMATION\nConference Call Information\nSeacoast will host a conference call on Friday, April 27, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time) to discuss the earnings results.

Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in its analysis of the Company’s performance and believes these presentations provide useful supplemental information, and a clearer understanding of the Company’s performance. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures enhance investors’ understanding of the Company’s business and performance and if not provided would be requested by the investor community. These measures are also useful in understanding performance trends and facilitate comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. The limitations associated with operating measures are the risk that persons might disagree as to the appropriateness of items comprising these measures and that different companies might calculate these measures differently. The Company provides reconciliations between GAAP and these non-GAAP measures. These disclosures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP.\nQuarterly Trends (Dollars in thousands except per share data) 1Q'18 4Q'17 3Q'17 2Q'17 1Q'17 Net income $ 18,027 $ 13,047 $ 14,216 $ 7,676 $ 7,926 Gain on sale of VISA stock 0 (15,153 ) 0 0 0 Securities (gains)/losses, net 102 (112 ) 47 (21 ) 0 Total Adjustments to Revenue 102 (15,265 ) 47 (21 ) 0 Merger related charges 470 6,817 491 5,081 533 Amortization of intangibles 989 963 839 839 719 Business continuity expenses - Hurricane Irma 0 0 352 0 0 Branch reductions and other expense initiatives 0 0 (127 ) 1,876 2,572 Total Adjustments to Noninterest Expense 1,459 7,780 1,555 7,796 3,824 Effective tax rate on adjustments (538 ) 3,147 (673 ) (2,786 ) (1,480 ) Effect of change in corporate tax rate 248 8,552 0 0 0 Adjusted Net Income $ 19,298 $ 17,261 $ 15,145 $ 12,665 $ 10,270 Earnings per diluted share, as reported 0.38 0.28 0.32 0.18 0.20 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share 0.40 0.37 0.35 0.29 0.26 Average shares outstanding (000) 47,688 46,473 43,792 43,556 39,499 Revenue $ 62,058 $ 74,868 $ 57,183 $ 54,644 $ 48,070 Total Adjustments to Revenue 102 (15,265 ) 47 (21 ) 0 Adjusted Revenue 62,160 59,603 57,230 54,623 48,070 Noninterest Expense 37,164 39,184 34,361 41,625 34,746 Total Adjustments to Noninterest Expense 1,459 7,780 1,555 7,796 3,824 Adjusted Noninterest Expense 35,705 31,404 32,806 33,829 30,922 Adjusted Noninterest Expense 35,705 31,404 32,806 33,829 30,922 Foreclosed property expense and net (gain)/loss on sale 192 (7 ) (296 ) 297 (293 ) Net Adjusted Noninterest Expense 35,513 31,411 33,102 33,532 31,215 Adjusted Revenue 62,160 59,603 57,230 54,623 48,070 Impact of FTE adjustment 91 174 154 164 211 Adjusted Revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis 62,251 59,777 57,384 54,787 48,281 Adjusted Efficiency Ratio 57.1 % 52.6 % 57.7 % 61.2 % 64.7 % Average Assets $ 5,851,688 $ 5,716,230 $ 5,316,119 $ 5,082,002 $ 4,699,745 Less average goodwill and intangible assets (167,136 ) (149,432 ) (118,364 ) (114,563 ) (78,878 ) Average Tangible Assets 5,684,552 5,566,798 5,197,755 4,967,439 4,620,867 Return on Average Assets (ROA) 1.25 % 0.91 % 1.06 % 0.61 % 0.68 % Impact of removing average intangible assets and related amortization 0.09 0.06 0.06 0.05 0.06 Return on Tangible Average Assets (ROTA) 1.34 0.97 1.12 0.66 0.74 Impact of other adjustments for Adjusted Net Income 0.04 0.26 0.04 0.36 0.16 Adjusted Return on Average Tangible Assets 1.38 1.23 1.16 1.02 0.90 Average Shareholders' Equity $ 695,240 $ 657,100 $ 587,919 $ 567,448 $ 466,847 Less average goodwill and intangible assets (167,136 ) (149,432 ) (118,364 ) (114,563 ) (78,878 ) Average Tangible Equity 528,104 507,668 469,555 452,885 387,969 Return on Average Shareholders' Equity 10.5 % 7.9 % 9.6 % 5.4 % 6.9 % Impact of removing average intangible assets and related amortization 3.9 2.8 2.9 1.9 1.9 Return on Average Tangible Common Equity (ROTCE) 14.4 10.7 12.5 7.3 8.8 Impact of other adjustments for Adjusted Net Income 0.4 2.8 0.3 3.9 1.9 Adjusted Return on Average Tangible Common Equity 14.8 13.5 12.8 11.2 10.7\nSource:Seacoast Banking Corporation of Florida",
