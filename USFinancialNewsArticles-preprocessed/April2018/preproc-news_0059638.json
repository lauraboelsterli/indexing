The right-hander struck eight.\nBetts led off the first inning with a home run.\nThe Blue Jays tied the game with a run in the bottom of the second. Steve Pearce led off with a double. With one out, Justin Smoak hit an infield single, and he continued to second and Pearce scored on a throwing error by third baseman Rafael Devers.\nThe Red Sox regained the lead with a fifth-inning run. Jackie Bradley Jr. led off with a walk, and Christian Vazquez was hit by a pitch. Brock Holt extended his hitting streak to eight games with an RBI double. Holt finished the game with three hits.\nThe Blue Jays tied the score in the bottom of the fifth on an RBI single by Pearce after Lourdes Gurriel Jr. hit an infield single and stole second.\nBarnes allowed a single by Holt with two outs in the seventh, and Betts followed with the go-ahead homer.\nHeath Hembree replaced Rodriguez with two outs in the bottom of the seventh and struck out Teoscar Hernandez to end the inning.\nBoston reliever Joe Kelly pitched a perfect eighth.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
