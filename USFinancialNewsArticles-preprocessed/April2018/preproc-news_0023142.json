    "text": "LONDON, April 11 (Reuters) - Swiss-based trading and mining giant Glencore will declare force majeure on some aluminium supply, days after U.S. sanctioned major supplier Rusal and its boss, metals magnate Oleg Deripaska, a source familiar with the matter said.\nGlencore is a Rusal shareholder and one of its biggest customers. Glencore Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg resigned from his role as Rusal director on Tuesday.\nForce majeure is a clause in contracts that allows both parties to walk out of the contract when an extraordinary event or circumstance beyond the control of the parties happen.
