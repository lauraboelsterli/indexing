FILE PHOTO: A logo is seen on the facade of the BASF plant and former Ciba production site in Schweizerhalle near Basel, Switzerland July 7, 2009. REUTERS/Christian Hartmann/File Photo\nThe European Commission said the concessions addressed concerns that the deal may reduce innovation for some herbicides and certain seed treatments.\nThe EU competition enforcer said BASF will sell one of the overlapping lines of research for the development of non-selective herbicides and its nematicidal seed treatment product Trunemco.\nBASF is acquiring some of Bayerâ€™s seed and herbicide assets, its global vegetable seeds business, its digital farming business and certain seed treatments.\nGerman drug and crop chemical maker Bayer is selling the assets in return for EU approval for its $62.5 billion (45.5 billion pounds) acquisition of U.S. peer Monsanto ( MON.N ). It received the go-ahead last month. Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek",
