Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for fighting discrimination. \nWurst said her treatment for HIV, which is spread when infected fluid enters the bloodstream, was going well. \n“Since I received the diagnosis, I have been in medical treatment, and for many years without interruption I have been below the detection limit, which means I am unable to transmit the virus,” Wurst said on Instagram. \nMore than 70 million people globally have been infected with the HIV virus and 35 million have died since the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, according to the World Health Organisation.
