    "text": "Updated 1 Hour Ago CNBC.com \nThree Asia-bound American Airlines flights that normally fly over Russia have been rerouted, as the airline assesses growing geopolitical tensions, a source familiar with the matter told CNBC on Saturday. \nIn an internal memorandum sent to pilots on Saturday that was seen by CNBC, the airline warned that some flights into Asia could be rerouted, as relations between Moscow and Washington appear to worsen because of the U.S.-led military intervention in Syria . \n\"The team at American regularly monitors global geopolitical issues and makes changes to aircraft routings when warranted,\" said the note to pilots. \nThe measure could cause delays. American Airlines, which operates more than 6,000 flights a day, said three flights separate flights were affected: Dallas to Hong Kong, Dallas to Beijing, and Chicago to Beijing, according to the document. \nThree were sent instead through Los Angeles. Because of range limits on planes, pilots often cannot simply take a longer route without additional fuel. Crews may also \"time out,\" meaning the daily hours they are allowed to work may run out if the routing is changed. \nThe airline said that it is engaging \"with the U.S. government in order to resolve any issues,\" according to the note. \nAmerican is working \"on our contingency plans in case certain areas are restricted,\" said the note to pilots, adding that while the measure isn't a \"long term solution, we are doing everything possible to minimize the disruption for our customers and team members.\" \nAn agreement that allows U.S. and Russian aircraft to use each other's airspace is set to expire next week, logistics industry publication The Loadstar reported earlier this month. The issue comes as tensions are rising with Russia, which harshly condemned U.S., British and French strikes on Syria which were launched late Friday.
