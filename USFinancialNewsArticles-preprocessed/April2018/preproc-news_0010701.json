    "text": "BEIJING, April 4 (Reuters) - China’s Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said on Wednesday that the U.S. accusation that foreign firms are forced to transfer technology to China is groundless.\nWang also said that while China’s intellectual property rights protection was not perfect, it was improving.\nHe was speaking at a news conference in Beijing after China unveiled counter-measures against planned import tariffs by the United States on Chinese goods.
