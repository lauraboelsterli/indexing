REUTERS/Leah Millis For all the news you need to start your day, subscribe to the News Now newsletter . The best of Reuters news delivered right into your inbox absolutely free.\nHighlights\nFacebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg returns to Capitol Hill today for more questioning by lawmakers who have a rare chance to air grievances directly to the head of the world’s largest social media network. Watch Zuckerberg’s live testimony to the House on the use of its data by Cambridge Analytica here at 10am ET.\nYesterday, Zuckerberg navigated through the first of two hearings without making any further promises to support new legislation or change how the social network does business . However, he did say his company would step up efforts to block hate messages in Myanmar and that Facebook was hiring dozens more Burmese-language speakers to remove threatening content.\nA judge rejected a request for dismissal of a case against two Reuters reporters Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo who were detained in Myanmar after being accused of possessing secret government papers. Follow our dedicated page for the latest updates on their case.\nSyria\nTrump warned Russia of a forthcoming response to suspected chemical attack in Syria, declaring that missiles “ will be coming ” and blasting Moscow for standing by Syrian President Bashar Assad.\nRussia has warned that any U.S. missiles fired at Syria would be shot down and the launch sites targeted, raising the possibility of a U.S.-Russian confrontation.\nSome major airlines were re-routing flights on after Europe’s air traffic control agency warned aircraft flying in the eastern Mediterranean to exercise caution due to possible air strikes into Syria.\nCommentary : Trump wants to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, effectively ceding the country to Iran, more chemical attacks and further conflict, writes Michael Makovsky . That makes it even more urgent for the president to confront Iran by withdrawing the United States from the nuclear agreement with Tehran.\n“U.S. credibility is now on the line... If Trump doesn’t withdraw based on a European faux-fix, it would severely weaken the United States’ standing with Iran and globally.” Michael Makovsky Business\nThe Federal Reserve proposed new rules that could allow some large banks to reduce the amount of capital they must hold as a cushion against a future economic shock.\nSprint has restarted talks to merge with T-Mobile US, people familiar with the matter said, the latest effort to bring together the fourth and third largest U.S. wireless carriers.\nFifteen U.S. corporations including online retailer Amazon.co, power company Duke Energy and insurer Prudential Financial avoided U.S. tax on nearly $25 billion in combined profits last year, a tax watchdog group said.\nReuters TV\nA military plane crashed in Algeria on Wednesday, killing 257 people according to local media reports.\n ",
