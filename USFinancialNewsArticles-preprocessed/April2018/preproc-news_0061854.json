    "text": "April 30, 2018 / 3:10 PM / Updated an hour ago CANADA STOCKS-TSX reopens near six-week high after Friday's abrupt shutdown Reuters Staff 3 Min Read\nApril 30 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index hovered near its six-week high on Monday, led by financial and industrial shares, after an outage halted trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Friday.\n* At 9:43 a.m. ET (1343 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX Composite Index rose 24.09 points, or 0.15 percent, to 15,693.02.\n* TMX Group Ltd, which operates the Toronto Stock Exchange and smaller Canadian trading platforms, said in a statement on Saturday that the failure of data storage equipment caused the outage.\n* Shares of TMX Group Ltd were down 2.5 percent.\n* Nine of Canada’s 10 main index sectors were higher, led by the financial sector.\n* Shares of Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion bank were up around 0.4 percent each, providing the biggest boost to the financial index.\n* Also helping the main index was the industrials group, boosted by Air Canada, which gained 1.6 percent after reporting a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss.\n* The materials index was the only laggard, dragged down by lower gold prices.\n* Gold fell to its lowest in nearly six weeks as the dollar strengthened, while easing tensions on the Korean peninsula helped boost appetite for assets seen as higher risk.\n* Shares of TransCanada Corp fell 1 percent after the company reported first-quarter results on Friday.\n* Prem Watsa’s Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited declined 0.8 percent after Toys “R” Us (Canada) Ltd on Friday received U.S. and Canadian court approval to sell itself to the company.\n* The TSX posted two new 52-week highs and three new lows. Across all Canadian issues there were five new 52-week highs and eight new lows.\n* The largest percentage gainer on the TSX was Prometic Life Scan after the company said its primary immunodeficiency treatment met the main goal in a late-stage study.\n* The largest decliner was Detour Gold Corp after brokerages cut their price targets on the stock.\n* Among the most active Canadian stocks by volumes were Katanga Mining, Potash Ridge Corp and Aurora Cannabis.\n* Volume on the TSX index was 14.15 million shares, compared with 25.64 million shares on Friday.\n* Economic data showed Canadian producer prices increased by 0.8 percent in March from February on higher prices of energy and petroleum products as well as paper and pulp.
