    "text": "TSX: ELD NYSE: EGO\nVANCOUVER, April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Eldorado Gold Corporation, (\"Eldorado\" or \"the Company\") today reports the Company's financial and operational results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights from the Quarter and Subsequent Period 1\nHellas Gold S.A. , Eldorado's Greek subsidiary, received a positive ruling in the arbitration proceedings with the Greek Government , and will continue to seek a collaborative dialogue with the Greek government.\nCompleted and filed technical reports for the Lamaque, Kisladag and Skouries projects. These technical reports were prepared pursuant to Canadian Securities Administrators' National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (\"NI-43-101\").\nInstallation of the additional filter press and paste plant completed at Olympias Phase II bringing the plant up to its run rate production of 1,250 tonnes per day.\nThe Company held $459.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and term deposits, and $250.0 million in undrawn lines of credit at the end of the quarter.\nProfit attributable to shareholders of $8.7 million ($0.01 per share) , compared to profit attributable to shareholders of $6.8 million ($0.01 per share) in the first quarter 2017.\nGold production of 89,374 ounces, (including 2,740 ounces from Lamaque pre-commercial production) (first quarter 2017: 75,172 ounces).\nGold revenues of $115.4 million (first quarter 2017: $90.5 million) on sales of 86,587 ounces at an average realized gold price of $1,333 per ounce (first quarter 2017: 74,068 ounces at $1,222 per ounce).\nAll-in sustaining cash costs averaged $878 per ounce (first quarter 2017: $791 per ounce).\nCash operating costs averaged $571 per ounce (first quarter 2017: $466 per ounce).\nCash generated from operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital was $37.9 million (first quarter 2017: $28.2 million).\n1 Throughout this press release we use cash operating cost per ounce, all-in sustaining cash cost per ounce, and cash flow from operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital as additional measures of Company performance. These are non-IFRS measures. Please see our MD&A for an explanation and discussion of these non-IFRS measures. All dollar amounts in US$, unless stated otherwise.\n\"We had a very successful first quarter maintaining operational momentum and laying a clear path forward for long-term growth,\" said George Burns, Eldorado's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"The filing of the technical reports was a crucial first step towards delivering on our prioritized development projects, Lamaque and the Kisladag mill. Given our current liquidity and anticipated capital deployment for 2018 and 2019, we have time to evaluate and implement an appropriate long-term financing plan to deliver these investments.\"\n\"Operationally, production was in-line with plans. We removed the tailings bottleneck at Olympias with the installation of a second tailings filter press. We also made good progress at our Lamaque project, including advancing refurbishment of the Sigma mill and continuing underground development at the Triangle deposit. At Kisladag, we are transitioning to right size the workforce to support leaching of the pad inventory and mine pre-stripping as we advance permitting and complete a feasibility study to position this asset for the next phase of growth.\"\n\"We are now in the delivery phase of our new business plan. By focusing on the disciplined build of Lamaque and the Kisladag Mill while maintaining a strong base of operations at Efemcukuru and Olympias Phase II, I am confident we will re-establish annual low cost production of 600,000 ounces by 2021. Skouries remains a compelling project, providing additional long-term growth, but requires collaborative government dialogue and a clear line of sight to cash flow in order for us to allocate further capital for development. We remain focused on driving forward our industry-leading growth projects under a disciplined capital allocation framework to create long-term value for all stakeholders.\"\nSummarized Quarterly Financial Results\n($ millions unless otherwise noted)\n3 months ended March 31\n2018\n2017\nRevenues\n131.9\n111.9\nGold revenues 1\n115.4\n90.5\nGold sold (ounces)\n86,587\n74,068\nAverage realized gold price ($/ounce)\n1,333\n1,222\nCash operating costs – gold mines ($/ounce)\n571\n466\nTotal cash costs – gold mines ($/ounce)\n598\n483\nAll-in sustaining cash cost – gold mines ($/ounce)\n878\n791\nGross profit from gold mining operations\n34.7\n37.0\nCash flow from operating activities 2\n37.9\n28.2\nAdjusted net earnings\n14.0\n8.0\nNet profit 3, 4\n8.7\n6.8\nEarnings per share – basic ($/share) 3\n0.01\n0.01\nEarnings per share – diluted ($/share) 3\n0.01\n0.01\n(1)\nIncluding market to market price adjustments on provisional sales.\n(2)\nBefore changes in non-cash working capital.\n(3)\nAttributable to shareholders of the Company.\n(4)\n2017 net profit is from continued operations.\nReview of Quarterly Financial Results\nProfit attributable to shareholders of the Company was $8.7 million compared to $6.8 million from continued operations for the first quarter of 2017. Gross profit from gold mining operations was $34.7 million compared to $37.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. Higher sales volumes and prices were offset by higher operating costs and depreciation, depletion and amortization (\"DD&A\") expense. Higher sales volumes were driven by sales from the newly commissioned Olympias mine as well as higher sales at Efemcukuru and Kisladag as compared to 2017.\nTotal cash costs per ounce increased year over year at both Efemcukuru and Kisladag with the increase at Kisladag being driven by the decrease in leach pad ounces as a result of an adjustment made in October 2017 as well as higher cyanide and lime costs. Olympias total cash costs were $734 per ounce and trending down over the quarter as issues encountered during commissioning in 2017 were resolved. DD&A expense was higher due to the start of commercial production at Olympias as well as an increase at Kisladag related to the leach pad adjustment. Stratoni gross profit fell $4.2 million year over year as a result of lower ore throughput.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $3.4 million lower year over year mainly due to lower employee payroll costs. Share based compensation expense was $3.6 million lower due to a postponement of the grant of options to employees as the Company was in blackout. Interest expense was $2.5 million higher as the Company is no longer capitalizing bond interest related to Olympias now that it is in commercial production.\nStratoni and Certej were impaired in previous years. Under IFRS any expenditures on these projects are capitalized and subsequently written-off in the same period. The Company recorded $4.0 million in asset write-downs related to these two projects.\nOperations Review\nTURKEY\nKışladağ\nProduction at Kisladag in the first quarter was 53,814 ounces of gold which was within guidance. This was higher than the previous year (52,644 ounces in the first quarter 2017) as adjusted cyanide concentrations coupled with increased irrigation volumes resulted in increased amounts of gold extracted from the pad. Kisladag reported a reduction in ore tonnes to the leach pad in the quarter (2.8 million tonnes in the first quarter 2018 versus 3.2 million tonnes in the first quarter 2017), due to the elimination of run of mine (\"ROM\") ore. The average ore grade in the quarter was 1.14 grams per tonne versus 1.13 grams per tonne in the first quarter 2017. Moving forward we expect gold production to decrease as no new material will be placed on the pad over the remainder of 2018 while the Company continues to evaluate feasibility of mill construction. Including the production reported in this quarter, the Company expects to recover 160,000-180,000 ounces for 2018-2019 from continued leaching of previously stacked ore.\nCash operating costs were within guidance at $576 per ounce ($446 per ounce in the first quarter 2017), but were higher year over year, due to increased lime and cyanide costs as well as the impact on average inventory unit carrying costs of a 40,000 ounce negative adjustment to estimated recoverable ounces remaining in the leach pad, which was recognized in October 2017.\nSustaining capital spending during the quarter of $7.5 million was related to waste stripping and site construction projects.\nDuring the quarter, the Company filed a pre-feasibility study on the mill project at Kisladag. The report outlined Proven and Probable reserves of 3.1 million contained ounces at 0.82 grams per tonne of gold to support a nine year mine life with average annual production of 270,000 ounces of gold at an all-in sustaining cost (\"AISC\") of $778 per ounce. At an assumed gold price of $1,300 per ounce the project is expected to generate an estimated after-tax project net present value of $434 million at a 5% discount rate, an internal rate of return of 22.1%, and a payback period of 3.7 years.\nEfemçukuru\nDuring the quarter, gold production at Efemcukuru of 22,855 ounces of gold (22,528 ounces in the first quarter 2017) was higher year on year with slightly higher processed tonnage (124,300 tonnes in the first quarter 2018 versus 115,800 tonnes in the first quarter 2017). Gold ounces sold were higher due to some carry over of 2017 gold production sold in 2018. The average ore grade in the quarter was 6.47 grams per tonne versus 6.77 grams per tonne in the first quarter 2017. Cash operating costs of $532 per ounce increased slightly ($515 per ounce in the first quarter 2017).\nSustaining capital spending in the quarter of $3.7 million included underground development, mine equipment overhauls, an upgrade to the water treatment plant and construction projects.\nGREECE\nOn September 14, 2017, Hellas Gold received formal notice from the Greek Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Environment and Energy initiating Greek domestic arbitration proceedings. The arbitration proceedings concluded on April 4, 2018 with a positive ruling for the Company. The Panel's ruling rejected the Greek State's motion that the technical study for the Madem Lakkos metallurgy plant for treating Olympias and Skouries concentrates, as submitted by the Company's Greek subsidiary Hellas Gold S.A. in December 2014, was in breach of the provisions of the Transfer Contract. The Company and Hellas Gold are continuing to engage with the Greek government in order to find a mutually-agreeable path forward with respect to its Kassandra investments.\nOlympias\nIn the first quarter 2018, Olympias produced 9,965 ounces of gold at cash operating costs of $699 per ounce of gold, costs were higher than guidance. Olympias began plant commissioning during the second quarter of 2017 and declared commercial production at the end of 2017. The plant was restricted to two-thirds of design throughput due to tailings filtration capacity constraints. This resulted in lower tonnage processed for much of the first quarter and higher per ounce costs.\nDuring the quarter, the second filter press was successfully installed and commissioned, which will allow the plant to reach its design throughput of 1,250 tonnes per day. Due to timing of concentrate shipments, gold sales for the quarter totaled 5,748 ounces of commercial production (versus 9,965 produced) and cash operating costs are calculated based on these ounces only. We expect costs to come down as mill throughput increases.\nCapital expenditures of $11.7 million included $2.6 million of sustaining capital on underground development, mine equipment overhauls and waste rock/tailings facilities construction projects. The remaining $9.1 million was related to mine construction costs including the completion of the paste plant and installation of the new tailings filter press as well as capitalized operating costs related to the concentrate attributable to the pre-commercial period of production.\nStratoni\nConcentrate production at Stratoni was lower year on year (8,565 tonnes in 2018 vs 11,599 tonnes in 2017). This was due to decreased mill throughput (38,000 thousand tonnes in the first quarter 2018 vs 44,600 thousand tonnes in the first quarter 2017), lower zinc grades (8.8% in the first quarter 2018 versus 10.5% in the first quarter 2017) and lower lead grades (5.4% in the first quarter 2018 versus 5.6% in the first quarter 2017). The expected reduced grade and tonnage reflects the continued depletion of the current mineable ore reserves remaining at the Mavres Petres ore body. Development during the quarter provided access to the lower sections of the mine for exploration drilling which continues to identify additional resources. These have the potential to extend the mine's life while allowing production rates to return to the historic levels of approximately 225,000 tonnes per annum.\nAverage realized price 2 for concentrate increased year on year ($1,423 per tonne in the first quarter 2018 versus $1,197 per tonne in the first quarter 2017) due to an increase in both lead and zinc prices. Total cash operating costs increased over the comparative quarter ($1,277 per tonne in the first quarter 2018 vs $811 per tonne in the first quarter 2017) due to reduced tonnes sold.\nSustaining capital spending in the quarter of $1.6 million related to underground development.\n2 Average realized price includes mark to market adjustments.\nDevelopment Projects and Exploration\nGREECE\nSkouries\nWorks completed during the quarter included ongoing bank stabilization, essential water ditches and storage ponds, primary drainage network, finalization of all site-built tanks, in addition to equipment erection (mills – liners, lube oil system, power) steelwork modifications and reinforced concrete works which are required for the ongoing maintenance regime and the long term storage of equipment.\nTotal capital expenditure for the quarter was $8.0 million, in line with current guidance. The Company announced its intention to move the project into care and maintenance in November 2017 until which time it receives approval of all permits required to complete construction. The transition to care and maintenance has been delayed by bad weather at site and is expected to be complete by the end of Q2. Ongoing care and maintenance costs are estimated to be $3-5 million per year for 2019 and beyond.\nDuring the quarter, the Company filed an updated technical report on the Skouries project. The report included Proven and Probable reserves of 3.8 million ounces of gold at 0.74 grams per tonne Au and 1.7 billion pounds of copper at 0.49% Cu, supporting a 23 year mine life at an average annual production rate of 140,000 ounces of gold and 67 million pounds of copper with production from both the open-pit and underground mines. At an assumed gold price of $1,300 per ounce the project is expected to generate an estimated after-tax project NPV $925 million at a 5% discount rate, an IRR of 21.2%, and a payback period of 3.4 years.\nPerama Hill\nPerama Hill remains on care and maintenance pending receipt of the necessary permits.\nCANADA\nLamaque\nThe mining lease for the Triangle deposit was approved during the quarter. This represents a major project milestone and enables Lamaque to enter the production phase. A total of 1,643 metres of underground development were completed at Triangle during the quarter. The ramp up of refurbishment work on the Sigma mill continued with the mobilization of key contractors to site. Key activities at the Sigma mill focused on the inspection and refurbishment of electrical equipment and motors.\nDuring the quarter, test mining extracted approximately 20,000 tonnes of ore with an average head grade of 6.3 grams per tonne gold, with approximately 6,000 tonnes processed at a nearby custom milling facility. Results from the custom milling have confirmed our metallurgical assumptions for future mill performance. A total of 2,740 ounces of gold were produced during the quarter, primarily from material mined during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCapital spending in the quarter totaled $18.9 million.\nDuring the quarter, Eldorado released the results of the Lamaque pre-feasibility study, which focused on the development of the Triangle deposit (one of three currently identified deposits at Lamaque) and the refurbishment of the previously producing Sigma mill. The study also included the release of maiden reserves at Triangle of approximately 893,000 contained ounces of gold at an average grade of 7.3 grams per tonne. This supports an initial seven year mine plan with an average annual production rate of 117,000 ounces of gold at AISC of $717 per ounce. At an assumed gold price of $1,300 per ounce the project is expected to generate an estimated after-tax project NPV of $205 million at a 5% discount rate, an IRR of 34.3%, and a payback period of 3.7 years. The Company is carrying out an aggressive program of infill and extension drilling with the goal of converting resource to Proven and Probable reserves as well as locating additional resources at Triangle and other known mineralized zones and new targets.\nBRAZIL\nTocantinzinho\nThe mining concession application is under review by the federal branch of the Mines Ministry and approval is expected this year. Work completed in the first quarter included a review of capital costs, detailed engineering of the tailings ponds and a consolidated geotechnical study.\nSpending in the quarter totaled $1.7 million.\nROMANIA\nCertej\nDuring the quarter work at Certej continued to focus on tailings impoundment and waste rock storage engineering and studies required for the permitting process. Work also continued on the evaluation of the limestone quarry and facilities required for the pressure oxidation process as well as providing engineering support for the permitting effort. Offsite infrastructure construction work continued including water tank installation, water supply pipeline installation and power line construction.\nSpending in the quarter totaled $2.2 million.\nExploration\nA total of $6.9 million was spent on exploration programs during the quarter. Exploration drilling totaled 21,240 meters and was conducted at projects in Quebec, Greece and Turkey.\nAt the Lamaque project in Quebec, five drill rigs were active at the Triangle deposit and several nearby target areas, completing 17,700 metres of drilling. Drilling at Triangle tested the continuity and extent of high-grade mineralization at levels beneath the C4 and C5 zones. Results were positive, with numerous intersections of shear-hosted mineralization similar to those at upper levels of the deposit, as well as secondary splay zones and associated extension vein systems. The current program at Triangle is designed to include at least 19,000 metres of drilling and testing the deposit to depths of approximately 2,000 metres. Drilling during the quarter also tested targets at the Gabbro, Southwest, Sigma East and Triangle East areas.\nIn Greece, underground development continued at the Stratoni mine on the hangingwall exploration crosscut. A total of 2,350 metres of resource expansion drilling were completed with three drill rigs active during the quarter targeting the western and downdip extensions of the Mavres Petres orebody. At Olympias, exploration drilling commenced late in the quarter testing previously unexplored areas immediately east of the East Zone orebody.\nIn central Turkey, the initial drilling program at the 60% owned Bambal Tepe exploration joint venture began in March. This 2,000 metre program will test the downdip extent of outcropping gold-mineralized zones focused along schist-marble contacts, as well as a strong chargeability anomaly in the same region.\n2018 Outlook and First Quarter Results\nIn 2018, Eldorado expects to produce 290,000-330,000 ounces of gold, including pre-commercial ounces from Lamaque. Cash operating costs are forecasted to be $580-630 per ounce.\n($ millions unless otherwise noted)\nQ1 2018 Actuals\n2018 Outlook (full year)\nOperations\nTotal\nOunces produced\n86,634\n290,000 – 330,000\nCash operating costs ($/ounce)\n571\n580 - 630\nSustaining capex\n15.4 1\n62.0\nKisladag\nOunces produced\n53,814\n120,000 – 130,000\nCash operating costs ($/ounce)\n576\n600 – 700\nSustaining capex\n7.5\n22.0\nEfemcukuru\nOunces produced\n22,855\n90,000 – 100,000\nCash operating costs ($/ounce)\n532\n530 – 570\nSustaining capex\n3.7\n20.0\nOlympias\nOunces produced\n9,965\n55,000 – 65,000\nCash operating costs ($/ounce)\n699\n550 – 650\nSustaining capex\n2.6\n20.0\nLamaque\nOunces produced\n2,740 2\n25,000 – 35,000 2\nCash operating costs ($/ounce)\nn/a\nn/a\nSustaining capex\nn/a\nn/a\nCorporate\nGeneral and administrative\n8.2\n45\nDevelopment capex\nKisladag\n0.0\n31.0\nOlympias\n9.1 3\n28.0\nLamaque\n18.9\n100.0\nSkouries\n8.0\n20.0\nStratoni\n0.0\n8.0\nTocantinzinho\n1.7\n8.0\nCertej\n2.2\n7.0\nExploration expenditure\n6.9 4\n25\n(1)\nIncluding $1.6 million in sustaining capital at Stratoni.\n(2)\nPre-commercial production.\n(3)\nIncludes capitalized selling expenses.\n(4)\nIncludes 2.4 million of expensed exploration and land purchases.\nCorporate\nBoard and Senior Management Changes\nRobert Gilmore has announced his intention to not stand for re-election to the Company's board at the June Annual and Special Meeting.

With respect to \"indicated mineral resource\" and \"inferred mineral resource\", there is a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and a great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility. It cannot be assumed that all or any part of a \"measured mineral resource\", \"indicated mineral resource\" or \"inferred mineral resource\" will ever be upgraded to a higher category.\nCautionary Note to US Investors Concerning Estimates of Measured, Indicated and Inferred Resources\nThe terms \"mineral resource\", \"measured mineral resource\", \"indicated mineral resource\", \"inferred mineral resource\" used herein are Canadian mining terms used in accordance with NI 43-101 under the guidelines set out in the Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy and Petroleum (the \"CIM\") Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as may be amended from time to time. These definitions differ from the definitions in the United States Securities & Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") Industry Guide 7. In the United States, a mineral reserve is defined as a part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time the mineral reserve determination is made.\nWhile the terms \"mineral resource\", \"measured mineral resource,\" \"indicated mineral resource\", and \"inferred mineral resource\" are recognized and required by Canadian regulations, they are not defined terms under standards in the United States and normally are not permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the SEC. As such, information contained herein concerning descriptions of mineralization and resources under Canadian standards may not be comparable to similar information made public by U.S. companies in SEC filings.\nAccordingly, information herein containing descriptions of our mineral deposits may not be comparable to similar information made public by US companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements under US federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nEldorado Gold Corporation\nUnaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars)\nNote\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\n$\n$\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents\n454,200\n479,501\nTerm deposits\n5,524\n5,508\nRestricted cash\n318\n310\nMarketable securities\n4,104\n5,010\nAccounts receivable and other\n79,587\n78,344\nInventories\n180,268\n168,844\n724,001\n737,517\nRestricted cash and other assets\n18,525\n22,902\nDefined benefit pension plan\n9,611\n9,919\nProperty, plant and equipment\n4,243,803\n4,227,397\nGoodwill\n4\n92,591\n92,591\n5,088,531\n5,090,326\nLIABILITIES & EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\n101,276\n110,541\nCurrent portion of asset retirement obligation\n2,682\n3,489\n103,958\n114,030\nDebt\n5\n594,332\n593,783\nOther non-current liability\n1,664\n110\nDefined benefit pension plan\n13,854\n13,599\nAsset retirement obligations\n96,863\n96,195\nDeferred income tax liabilities\n546,728\n549,127\n1,357,399\n1,366,844\nEquity\nShare capital\n3,007,924\n3,007,924\nTreasury stock\n(11,056)\n(11,056)\nContributed surplus\n2,618,323\n2,616,593\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n(22,080)\n(21,350)\nDeficit\n(1,939,851)\n(1,948,569)\nTotal equity attributable to shareholders of the Company\n3,653,260\n3,643,542\nAttributable to non-controlling interests\n77,872\n79,940\n3,731,132\n3,723,482\n5,088,531\n5,090,326\nPlease see the Financial Statements dated March 31, 2018 for notes to the accounts.\nEldorado Gold Corporation\nUnaudited Condensed Consolidated Income Statements\n(Expressed in thousands of U.S. dollars except per share amounts)\nFor the quarter ended March 31\nNote\n2018\n2017\n$\n$\nRevenue\nMetal sales\n131,905\n111,880\nCost of sales\nProduction costs\n67,235\n50,688\nDepreciation and amortization\n29,188\n18,064\n96,423\n68,752\nGross profit\n35,482\n43,128\nExploration expenses\n4,148\n5,247\nMine standby costs\n2,706\n1,031\nOther operating items\n-\n2,133\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n8,225\n11,614\nDefined benefit pension plan expense\n1,083\n831\nShare based payments\n8\n1,318\n5,128\nWrite-down of assets\n4,024\n1,054\nForeign exchange loss\n1,142\n88\nOperating profit\n12,836\n16,002\nGain (loss) on disposal of assets\n86\n(307)\nGain on derivatives and other investments\n788\n34\nOther income\n3,097\n2,349\nAsset retirement obligation accretion\n(510)\n(523)\nInterest and financing costs\n(3,564)\n(1,110)\nProfit from continuing operations before income tax\n12,733\n16,445\nIncome tax expense\n7,084\n10,776\nProfit from continuing operations\n5,649\n5,669\nLoss from discontinued operations\n-\n(3,000)\nProfit for the period\n5,649\n2,669\nAttributable to:\nShareholders of the Company\n8,718\n3,834\nNon-controlling interests\n(3,069)\n(1,165)\nProfit for the period\n5,649\n2,669\nProfit (loss) attributable to shareholders of the Company\nContinuing operations\n8,718\n6,834\nDiscontinued operations\n-\n(3,000)\n8,718\n3,834\nWeighted average number of shares outstanding (thousands)\nBasic\n794,011\n716,600\nDiluted\n794,011\n717,283\nProfit per share attributable to shareholders\nof the Company:\nBasic profit per share\n0.01\n0.01\nDiluted profit per share\n0.01\n0.01\nProfit per share attributable to shareholders\nof the Company -
