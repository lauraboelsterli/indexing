    "text": "April 11, 2018 / 5:59 AM / Updated an hour ago South Korea prosecutors say ousted Park unfairly avoided charges, appeal Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nSEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean prosecutors said on Wednesday former president Park Geun-hye had unfairly dodged some bribery charges in her trial and they appealed against her jailing for only 24 years, after they had demanded a 30-year sentence, media reported. South Korean ousted leader Park Geun-hye arrives at a court in Seoul, South Korea, August 25, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji \nPark was sentenced last Friday at the conclusion of the country’s most momentous graft trial in years, which exposed webs of corruption between political leaders and some of its biggest conglomerates. \n“The Seoul Central District Prosecutors’ Office said it finds part of the ruling clearing Park of some of the bribery charges against her unfair,” the Yonhap news agency reported. \nThe office was not immediately available for comment. \nPark, the daughter of a former military dictator who became South Korea’s first democratically elected leader in 2012, had pleaded not guilty. \nShe was fined 18 billion won (£11.9 million) after she was found guilty on 16 counts, including bribery and abuse of power, in connection with the scandal that saw a court oust her from office in March last year. \nProsecutors had charged her on 18 counts and called for an 118.5 billion won ($111.16 million) fine, in addition to a 30-year jail term, but the court acquitted her of two of the charges. \nThe court ruled that Park was guilty of colluding with a friend, Choi Soon-sil, to receive about 7 billion won ($6.56 million) each from Lotte Group, a retail giant, and Samsung, the world’s biggest maker of smartphones and semiconductors, while demanding 8.9 billion won from SK, an energy conglomerate. \nOne of Park’s state-appointed lawyers suggested after the trial that she could appeal, but she has yet to do so. \nIn South Korea, an appeal must be filed within a week of a court verdict.
