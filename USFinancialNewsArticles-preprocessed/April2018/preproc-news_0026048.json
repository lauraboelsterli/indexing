Mr. Rossiter also worked as a process engineer with SNC-Lavalin Group and was an officer in the Canadian Army.\nMr. Rossiter will continue to report directly to Enerflex’s President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Mr. Goertzen, and will be responsible for leading the organization’s global operations. He will focus on strategically aligning the business across the natural gas value chain while enhancing the synergistic relationship between the Company's capabilities and product and service offering, as well as concentrating on growth opportunities.\n“With a proven track-record as a leader and a steward of the Company, the Board of Directors and I are confident that Marc will continue to deliver superior results in this new role,” said J.
