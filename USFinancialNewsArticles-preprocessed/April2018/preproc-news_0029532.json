The record day for the right to receive a cash dividend is April 13, 2018 and payment through Euroclear Sweden AB is expected to be made on April 18, 2018.\nCharles A.

The Annual General Meeting further approved the proposed remuneration to the members of the Board of Directors as set out in the notice and the principles for remuneration and other terms for members of the executive management.\nFurthermore, the Annual General Meeting approved the Board of Directors' proposal that it be authorized to resolve on acquisition of the Company's own shares, on one or several occasions prior to the next Annual General Meeting, provided the Company's holding does not at any time exceed 10 percent of all shares in the Company. The shares shall be acquired on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the price interval registered at any given time, i.e. the interval between the highest bid price and the lowest selling price. Swedish Match owns 6,437,462 treasury shares as per April 11, 2018.\nIn addition, the Annual General Meeting resolved to reduce the Company's share capital by 12,533,911.65 SEK by means of withdrawal of 5,850,000 previously repurchased shares held in treasury, with a simultaneous bonus issue, without issuing any new shares, of a corresponding amount to restore the share capital.

The number of shares that may be issued may not exceed a maximum dilution effect of 10 percent of the share capital and votes at the time of the Annual General Meeting 2018.\nThe Annual General Meeting approved all other proposals made by the Board of Directors and the Nominating Committee.
