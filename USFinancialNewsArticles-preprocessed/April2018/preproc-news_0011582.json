    "text": "AKRON, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gabriel Performance Products (“Gabriel”), a U.S.-based specialty chemicals company, announces the acquisition of Royce International (“Royce”).\nHeadquartered in Sarasota, FL, Royce is a custom solutions provider of specialty epoxy resins, diluents, curing agents, and additives. These are sold under the RoyOxy TM trademark into CASE (Coatings, Adhesives, Sealants and Elastomers) applications. Royce’s technical sales and R&D team is dedicated to providing customized solutions to its customers.\n“The acquisition of Royce further expands Gabriel’s offerings of solutions for the Coatings, Adhesives, and Composites markets,” said Seth Tomasch, CEO of Gabriel. “Royce’s diversified product portfolio, technical support and formulation expertise will allow us to provide a broader array of products and services to our customers.”\nHarry Anand, CEO of Royce, states, “Customers of both companies will be served well by this acquisition. Combined, the two companies will have a broader line of specialty products, technical expertise and manufacturing capabilities.”\nRoyce Associates, a sister company of Royce International, is not a part of this transaction and will continue to manufacture and supply its line of reductive chemicals, solvent and basic dyes, color concentrates, additives and other specialty chemicals.\nGabriel intends to retain all product lines and their respective brand names. The acquisition follows Gabriel’s announced acquisitions of Ranbar Electrical Materials, InChem's proprietary Phenoxy Resin® business and the BASF Versamid® polyamide curing agent product line.\nAbout Gabriel Performance Products, LLC\nGabriel Performance Products, LLC is a market-leader in epoxy curing agents, Phenoxy additives, and specialty chemical manufacturing.
