Both of the newly appointed directors, Carol Meyrowitz and Sharen Jester Turney, will add invaluable knowledge and experience in retail to NewStore.\n“I firmly believe that retail success is driven by a deep understanding of consumers and their relationship to brands,” said Carol Meyrowitz, Executive Chairman of the Board of The TJX Companies, Inc., a Fortune 100 company that operates more than 4,000 stores. “NewStore empowers both customers and associates to create rich in-store experiences through mobile technology and the platform gives retailers a means to meet the high expectation of consumers.”\nPrior to her current positions, Carol Meyrowitz was the CEO of TJX Companies from 2007 to 2016. She also previously held several positions within TJX since joining the company in 1983. Formerly, Ms. Meyrowitz served on the Staples, Inc., Amscan Holdings, Inc., and the Yankee Candle Company Boards. Currently, she sits on several Advisory Boards. She has been recognized as Fortune’s Business Person of the Year and was among their Most Powerful Women listing in 2015. In that same year, she was featured among Barron’s World’s Best CEO’s for the third consecutive year. She has also been listed on Forbes’ World’s Most Powerful Women lists.\n“At Victoria’s Secret, we created an emotional experience that captivated women around the world. We understood that successful retail is about delivering meaningful connections,” said Sharen Jester Turney, Former President and CEO, Victoria’s Secret. “NewStore offers a platform for scaling that crucial personalized experience between associate and consumer, which finally delivers the omnichannel capabilities retail has been waiting for.”\nSharen served as President and CEO of Victoria’s Secret from 2006-2016.
