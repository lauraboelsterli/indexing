    "text": "SOFIA, April 27 (Reuters) - Bulgaria wants to apply to join the ERM-2 mechanism, a waiting room for the adoption of the euro currency, in the first half of this year, Finance Minister Vladislav Goranov said on Friday.\n“There is nothing that enforces a change in our strategy... The timeline, which we have set together with the Bulgarian National Bank is the first half of the year, “ Goranov told a news conference after a meeting of EU finance ministers.\nHe said that timeline for the application did not clash with expectations of Bulgaria’s prime minister that the Balkan country would be allowed into the ERM-2 — a stability test for the currency — within a year.\nGoranov said he expected Bulgaria would join the euro after spending the 24 months in the ERM-2 required by EU laws. There are now 19 countries that share the euro currency. (Reporting by Tsvetelia Tsolova)\n ",
