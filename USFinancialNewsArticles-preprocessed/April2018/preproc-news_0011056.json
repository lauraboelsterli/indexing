Air France employees stand at the check in desk at Nice airport as Air France pilots, cabin and ground crews unions call for strike over salaries in France, April 3, 2018. REUTERS/Eric Gaillard \nThe airline was hit by a series of strikes in March and early April and the unions have already planned to go on strike on April 7, 10 and 11. \nAir France management has said that the unionsâ€™ demands for a six percent wage increase could jeopardise its growth plans.
