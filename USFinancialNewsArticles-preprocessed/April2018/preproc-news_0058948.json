Best S&P stock Chipotle surges ~30 pct as CEO debut delights\n** Energy rallies 0.6 pct, though weak refining margins clip Exxon’s and Chevron’s Q1 numbers . Nevertheless, still may be time for DJI’s energy duo to outperform on the charts\n** Tech loses 0.6 pct. Alphabet’s strong ad sales growth fails to offset surge in costs . But Facebook blockbuster results soothe nerves over data privacy scandal. This as Microsoft shows growth across segments, and Intel in its data center business\n** Materials down 2.1 pct. Worst SPX stock Freeport-McMoRan slides 21 pct on Q1 profit miss , and onerous environmental demands from Indonesia’s govt\n** Industrials down 3.1 pct. Caterpillar tumbles on fears of increasing steel prices and 3M dives on forecast cut\n** SPX sector performance over past 12 mths: reut.rs/2Kjhzrf\n** On IPO front, DocuSign caps stellar week for tech deals\n ",
