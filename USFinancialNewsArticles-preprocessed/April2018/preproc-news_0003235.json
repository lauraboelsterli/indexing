This resulted in a decrease in net loss attributable to Net Element, Inc. stockholders of $3,574,052 primarily due to an increase in revenues, decreases in depreciation, amortization and interest expenses, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses. Net loss attributable to Net Element, Inc. stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2016 was also negatively affected by an expense for loss from stock value guarantee related to the PayOnline acquisition.\nEliminating the effects of non-cash compensation and the 2016 PayOnline stock value guarantee payment, we reported an adjusted non-GAAP, net loss attributable to Net Element, Inc. stockholders of $6,973,061 or ($3.54) loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to an adjusted non-GAAP, net loss attributable to Net Element, Inc. stockholders of $7,861,241 or ($6..02) loss per share for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe following table sets forth our sources of revenues, cost of revenues and gross margins for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nGross Margin Analysis Twelve Twelve Months Ended Months Ended Increase / Source of Revenues December 31, 2017 Mix December 31, 2016 Mix (Decrease) North American\nTransaction Solutions $ 51,138,327 85.1 % $ 42,130,902 77.6 % $ 9,007,425 International\nTransaction Solutions 8,926,497 14.9 % 12,155,957 22.4 % (3,229,460 ) Total $ 60,064,824 100.0 % $ 54,286,859 100.0 % $ 5,777,965\nTwelve Twelve Months Ended % of Months Ended % of Increase Cost of Revenues December 31, 2017 revenues December 31, 2016 revenues (Decrease) North American Transaction Solutions $ 44,265,264\n86.6 % $ 36,342,465\n86.3 % $ 7,922,799 International Transaction Solutions 6,971,948\n78.1 % 9,365,776\n77.0 % (2,393,828 ) Total $ 51,237,212 85.3 % $ 45,708,241 84.2 % $ 5,528,971\nTwelve Twelve Months Ended % of Months Ended % of Increase Gross Margin December 31, 2017 revenues December 31, 2016 revenues (Decrease) North American Transaction Solutions $ 6,873,063 13.4 % $ 5,788,437 13.7 % $ 1,084,626 International Transaction Solutions 1,954,549 21.9 % 2,790,181 23.0 % (835,632 ) Total $ 8,827,612 14.7 % $ 8,578,618 15.8 % $ 248,994 Net revenues consist primarily of service fees from transaction processing. Net revenues were $60,064,824 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $54,286,859 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net revenues is primarily due to continued organic growth of North American merchants with emphasis on value-added offerings partially offset by a $3,229,460 decrease in net revenues from our International Transaction Solutions segment as we experience increased competition, decreased margins and reorganizing assignments from our International Transaction Solutions segment.\nCost of revenues represents direct costs of generating revenues, including commissions, mobile operator fees, purchases of short numbers, interchange expense and processing fees. Cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $ 51,237,212 as compared to $45,708,241 for the year ended December 31, 2016. The year over year increase in cost of revenues of $5,528,971 was driven by a $7,922,799 increase due to increased North American Transaction Solutions sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. This was partially offset by a $2,393,828 decrease in the International Transaction Solutions segment cost of revenues due to the decrease in International Transaction Solutions revenues from Digital Provider.\nGross Margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $8,827,613, or 14.7% of net revenue, as compared to $8,578,618, or 15.8% of net revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary reason gross margin percentages decreased was due to increased (lower margin) business mix from North American Transaction Solutions and a decrease in Digital Provider business that had higher margins.\nTotal operating expenses were $17,425,030 for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to total operating expenses of $17,416,066 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of general and administrative expenses of $10,629,773, non-cash compensation of $2,940,424, a bad debt provision of $1,320,848 and depreciation and amortization of $2,533,985. For the year ended December 31, 2016, operating expenses consisted of general and administrative expenses of $8,797,883, non-cash compensation of $3,463,435, a bad debt provision of $1,688,237, and depreciation and amortization of $3,466,511.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 consisted of operating expenses not otherwise delineated in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss and include salaries and benefits, professional fees, rent, business development, travel expense, filing fees, transaction gains or losses, office expenses, communication expenses, insurance expenses, and other expenses required to run our business, as follows:\nTwelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2017 Category North American\nTransaction\nSolutions International\nTransaction\nSolutions Corporate\nExpenses &\nEliminations Total Salaries, benefits, taxes and contractor payments $ 1,970,860 $ 1,696,245 $ 2,082,294 $ 5,749,399 Professional fees 505,383 819,184 1,312,271 2,636,838 Rent - 245,539 245,186 490,725 Business development 53,011 32,072 3,569 88,652 Travel expense 331,299 32,397 130,198 493,894 Filing fees - - 72,035 72,035 Transaction (gains) losses 742 (41,200 ) 1,642 (38,816 ) Office expenses 303,586 98,961 120,103 522,650 Communications expenses 47,878 130,046 79,288 257,212 Insurance expense - 5,401 135,386 140,787 Other expenses 38,788 14,716 162,893 216,397 Total $ 3,251,547 $ 3,033,361 $ 4,344,865 $ 10,629,773\nTwelve months ended\nDecember 31, 2016 Category North American\nTransaction\nSolutions International\nTransaction\nSolutions Corporate\nExpenses &\nEliminations Total Salaries, benefits, taxes and contractor payments $ 1,650,043 $ 1,593,390 $ 1,506,752 $ 4,750,185 Professional fees 422,681 901,861 1,390,297 2,714,839 Rent - 282,099 284,234 566,333 Business development 36,923 129,525 11,841 178,289 Travel expense 191,848 43,436 111,510 346,794 Filing fees - - 82,560 82,560 Transaction (gains) losses 49 (327,122 ) (413,470 ) (740,543 ) Office expenses 103,616 110,897 107,237 321,750 Communications expenses 77,897 93,152 73,104 244,153 Insurance expense - 9,855 163,506 173,361 Other expenses 270 (68,976 ) 228,868 160,162 Total $ 2,483,327 $ 2,768,117 $ 3,546,439 $ 8,797,883\nVariance Category North American\nTransaction\nSolutions International\nTransaction\nSolutions Corporate\nExpenses &\nEliminations Total Salaries, benefits, taxes and contractor payments $ 320,817 $ 102,855 $ 575,542 $ 999,214 Professional fees 82,702 (82,677 ) (78,026 ) (78,001 ) Rent - (36,560 ) (39,048 ) (75,608 ) Business development 16,088 (97,453 ) (8,272 ) (89,637 ) Travel expense 139,451 (11,039 ) 18,688 147,100 Filing fees - - (10,525 ) (10,525 ) Transaction (gains) losses 693 285,922 415,112 701,727 Office expenses 199,970 (11,936 ) 12,866 200,900 Communications expenses (30,019 ) 36,894 6,184 13,059 Insurance expense - (4,454 ) (28,120 ) (32,574 ) Other expenses 38,518 83,692 (65,975 ) 56,235 Total $ 768,220 $ 265,244 $ 798,426 $ 1,831,890 Salaries, benefits, taxes and contractor payments were $5,749,399 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $4,750,185 for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing an increase of $999,214. The increase in salaries of $999,214 was due primarily to the increase of corporate salaries of $575,542, resulting primarily from a $300,000 increase in discretionary bonus granted to our CEO by the Board of Directors and to a lesser extent increases in executive salaries. The $320,817 increase in the North American Transaction Solutions segment was primarily due to increases in headcount and sales incentives for key employees as the business grew.

Further information is available at www.NetElement.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Any statements contained in this press release that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed forward-looking statements. Words such as \"continue,\" \"will,\" \"may,\" \"could,\" \"should,\" \"expect,\" \"expected,\" \"plans,\" \"intend,\" \"anticipate,\" \"believe,\" \"estimate,\" \"predict,\" \"potential,\" and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements, many of which are generally outside the control of Net Element and are difficult to predict. Examples of such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to whether blockchain technologies will in fact play a key role in future commerce in the payments industry; and whether the blockchain technologies will result in the creation of value-added services for merchants and their customers; whether the Company will be successful in the development of a decentralized crypto-based ecosystem to act as a framework for a number of value-added services that can connect merchants and consumers directly utilizing blockchain technology whether through its platform called Netevia or otherwise. Additional examples of such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to (i) Net Element's ability (or inability) to obtain additional financing in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms when needed; (ii) Net Element's ability to maintain existing, and secure additional, contracts with users of its payment processing services; (iii) Net Element's ability to successfully expand in existing markets and enter new markets; (iv) Net Element's ability to successfully manage and integrate any acquisitions of businesses, solutions or technologies; (v) unanticipated operating costs, transaction costs and actual or contingent liabilities; (vi) the ability to attract and retain qualified employees and key personnel; (vii) adverse effects of increased competition on Net Element's business; (viii) changes in government licensing and regulation that may adversely affect Net Element's business; (ix) the risk that changes in consumer behavior could adversely affect Net Element's business; (x) Net Element's ability to protect its intellectual property; (xi) local, industry and general business and economic conditions; and (xii) geopolitical instability and other conditions that may adversely affect trends in consumer business and government spending. Additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements can be found in the most recent annual report on Form 10-K and in any other of the Company’s subsequent filings, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K filed by Net Element with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Net Element anticipates that subsequent events and developments may cause its plans, intentions and expectations to change. Net Element assumes no obligation, and it specifically disclaims any intention or obligation, to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as expressly required by law.\nNET ELEMENT, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 ASSETS Current assets: Cash $ 11,285,669 $ 621,635 Accounts receivable, net 5,472,856 7,126,429 Prepaid expenses and other assets 2,282,614 1,467,897 Total current assets, net 19,041,139 9,215,961 Fixed assets, net 58,268 117,295 Intangible assets, net 3,127,760 3,589,850 Goodwill 9,643,752 9,643,752 Other long term assets 460,511 603,209 Total assets $ 32,331,430 $ 23,170,067 LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 6,785,459 $ 7,510,113 Accrued expenses 3,674,430 5,518,823 Deferred revenue 1,712,591 1,355,972 Notes payable (current portion) 2,493,973 808,976 Due to related parties -
