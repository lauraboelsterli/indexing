    "text": "Gregoire Sitter | EyeEm | Getty Images Dogs eat out of bowls. \nJ. M. Smucker said on Wednesday it would acquire pet food and pet snacks maker Ainsworth Pet Nutrition in an all-cash transaction for about $1.7 billion to strengthen its pet food portfolio in an fast-growing pet food market. \nJ. M. Smucker also said it plans to explore options for its U.S. baking business, including a sale. \nThe baking business, which includes brands like Pillsbury and Martha White, is expected to generate net sales of about $370 million this fiscal year \nThe deal comes nearly a month after rival General Mills said in February it would buy Blue Buffalo Pet Products for about $8 billion. \nThe pet food and pet snacks market generates over $30 billion in annual retail sales in the United States, J. M. Smucker said. \nThe company said it expects annual cost synergies of $55 million within first three years and net sales of about $800 million in the first full year, following the deal. \nJ.M. Smucker's shares were up 1.6 percent at $123.70 in after-market trading. Related Securities",
