    "text": "170 COMMENTS Reports that investigators homed in on the alleged Golden State Killer using a public genealogy website raises new questions about privacy and how law enforcement uses DNA information.\nInvestigators used DNA from crime-scene samples and compared it with genetic profiles on a site called GEDmatch, according to GEDmatch and law-enforcement officials. The site allows people to upload their genetic information to an online database that is searchable by other users. The practice helps people find family members because blood relatives share closely related genetic traits.\nThat feature is also what officials leveraged to find the alleged serial killer, Joseph James DeAngelo, a 72-year-old former police officer. Investigators found a relative of the suspect online, then looked at online family trees to narrow down the search, according to the Sacramento County district attorney’s office.\nThe use of DNA information in criminal investigations isn’t new , but what makes the case noteworthy, according to legal experts and bioethicists, is the use of a nonstate-owned DNA database , where individuals who share their genetic code are essentially sharing information about family members who may not have consented to reveal such data.\nState-owned databases contain DNA data of convicted criminals, whereas sites like GEDmatch contain data of people who have likely never had run-ins with law enforcement.\nMichael Bock, a former New York Police Department Special Victims Division investigator for 10 years, described searching in a genealogy website as “uncharted territory.”\n“It was an excellent idea,” the former sergeant said. “I’m just concerned because there’s not a lot of cases—there’s no cases—that have been done this way.”\nThe process, known as familial DNA searching, usually uses specialized software to generate a ranked list of potential relatives, according to legal experts who study use of DNA data in law enforcement. Familial searches are useful but also controversial, because they help authorities identify people who wouldn’t have been suspects otherwise.\n“The number of people who become subject to genetic surveillance is much broader,” said Natalie Ram, an assistant professor at the University of Baltimore’s School of Law who focuses on legal issues surrounding the use of DNA information.\nRelated\nSo-Called Golden State Killer Captured, Authorities Say (April 25) FBI’s New DNA Process Produces More Matches in Suspect Database (Aug. 25, 2016) How One Family Faced Difficult Decisions About DNA Sequencing (Sept. 25, 2015) Supreme Court: Police Can Take DNA Samples in Arrests (June 3, 2013) A Little Digging Unmasks DNA Donor Names (Jan. 17, 2013) The utilization of DNA databases—and familial searches—has expanded in recent years, including in New York. In June 2017, the Commission on Forensic Science, a state panel of medical examiners, district attorneys and others, voted 9-2 approving a familial-search policy . The method allows officials to search a state database with some 600,000 profiles, for people who may be related to someone convicted of a crime.\nCritics say familial DNA searching could invade the privacy of innocent people and target minorities, who are disproportionately represented in state databases. States don’t always publicly disclose the use of familial DNA searching.\nLawyers from the Legal Aid Society and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP filed a lawsuit in February in Manhattan Supreme Court against New York’s Division of Criminal Justice and the Commission on Forensic Science seeking to block the searches.\nGEDmatch’s purpose is genealogy research, according to its terms and policy statement.\n“Although we were not approached by law enforcement or anyone else about his case…it has always been GEDmatch’s policy to inform users that the database could be used for other uses,” said Curtis Rogers of GEDmatch in a statement. “It is important that GEDmatch participants understand the possible uses of their DNA, including identification of relatives that have committed crimes or were victims of crimes.” Users have the option to delete their uploaded data, he said.\nThe reality, according to bioethicists, is that most people don’t understand those risks.\nGEDmatch’s own terms and policy statement doesn’t mention law enforcement or police explicitly, though it does say identity theft, credit fraud and access by “unintended means” are possible risks. Genealogy and consumer DNA-testing company 23andMe Inc.’s terms of service say the company is “free to preserve and disclose any and all personal information to law enforcement or others if required to do so by law.” Ancestry, another popular genealogy site, says it doesn’t share user’s genetic information with law enforcement “unless compelled by valid legal process.” Both companies said they weren’t involved in the Golden State Killer investigation.\nThere are few legal protections for people who willingly upload their data to such sites. In the U.S., privacy laws concerning health-related data cover institutions, like hospitals and insurance companies, not the data itself. Genetic data held outside of a medical record isn’t protected.\n“I don’t think people think about that,” said John Wilbanks, chief commons officer at Seattle health-tech firm Sage Bionetworks, who researches data-access policy and informed consent. But the issue will become important, he said, as third parties find more uses for people’s data.\nTo confirm they had the right person, investigators said they conducted surveillance of Mr. DeAngelo at his Citrus Heights, Calif., home and collected “discarded DNA”—a practice that has raised its own ethical questions. It is based on something called abandonment, which means that law enforcement can use as evidence items that have been discarded, including DNA.\n“We haven’t really adjusted those rules to represent or reflect the realities of modern technology. The fact that you left a few cells on a handkerchief that you throw away…means that in theory you have knowingly exposed your entire genetic code to the public,” said Erin Murphy, a New York University law professor who focuses on forensics. It is worrisome, she said, because people shed DNA involuntarily.\nWrite to Daniela Hernandez at daniela.hernandez@wsj.com , Zolan Kanno-Youngs at Zolan.Kanno-Youngs@wsj.com and Zusha Elinson at zusha.elinson@wsj.com",
