    "text": "WEST DES MOINES, Iowa, West Bancorporation, Inc. (Nasdaq:WTBA), parent company of West Bank, today reported that first quarter 2018 net income was $7.4 million, or $0.45 per diluted common share. This is the highest quarterly net income ever recorded by the Company and compares to first quarter 2017 net income of $6.1 million, or $0.37 per diluted common share. First quarter 2018 net income was positively impacted by a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. On April 25, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.20 per common share, an increase of $0.02 from the prior quarter. The dividend is payable on May 23, 2018, to stockholders of record on May 9, 2018.\n“We are excited about our first quarter 2018 results,” commented Dave Nelson, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “As we celebrate West Bank’s 125th anniversary in 2018, management remains committed to achieving a high level of earnings and creating value for our stockholders. Our strong performance allowed us to increase our second quarter dividend to $0.20 per common share. This is an 11 percent increase in the quarterly dividend from the prior dividend and the highest ever paid by the Company.”\nBrad Winterbottom, West Bank President, said, “We continue to focus on creating and expanding long-term community banking relationships in all our markets. We are committed to providing high levels of service to our valued customers. We believe our loan portfolio continues to have a high level of credit quality, our loan pipeline is strong, and we are well positioned for long-term growth. We are also pleased with our growth in trust revenues.”\nEastern Iowa Market President, Jim Conard, commented, “Commercial development activity in our market is thriving, with West Bank providing financing for several major construction projects in the market. Our experience and market leadership in construction and development financing has helped fuel 4.8 percent year-to-date growth in our loan portfolio during the first quarter of 2018, and our pipeline of loans for both new and existing commercial clients continues to grow.”\n“West Bank in Rochester followed up on a very good year in 2017 with solid momentum in the first quarter of 2018. Loans outstanding in the Rochester market exceeded $157 million as of March 31, 2018, an increase of over 8 percent since the beginning of the year,” said Mike Zinser, Rochester Market President. “In addition to healthy loan activity in business banking, our personal banking team continues to produce deposit growth in the Rochester market. Our business and retail pipelines are thriving, both in dollars and number of prospective customers wanting to do business with West Bank.” Zinser concluded, “As we celebrate our fifth anniversary in Rochester this month, we are pleased to have provided over $250 million in loans to Rochester businesses since 2013. We are very proud of the first class team we have assembled, the customers who have joined us and the solid reputation we continue to hold in the Rochester business community.”\nThe Company filed its report on Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission today.
