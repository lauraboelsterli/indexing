    "text": "\nGoogle parent company Alphabet just reported its first quarter earnings, beating analyst expectations on both the top and bottom line. The stock initially popped 3 percent on the news, but has seesawed to about .3 percent down. \nHere are the most important numbers: \n— Earnings per share : $9.93 vs $9.28 expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate \n— Revenue : $31.15 billion vs $30.29 billion expected by a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate \n— Operating income for 2018 came in as $7 billion versus $6.6 billion in 2017 \nBecause of a new accounting rule , Alphabet had to report the unrealized gains and losses from its investments in companies like Uber, and reported a $3 billion gain on equity securities. \nGoogle's ads business posted $26.642 billion in revenue for the first quarter while its \"other revenues,\" which include its cloud business and hardware sales was nearly $4.3 billion. That's up from $3.2 billion year-over-year and includes revenues from smart-home unit Nest for the first time . \nThis quarter, Google changed its monetization metrics for Google's Network properties from clicks to impressions. \nGoogle properties, like search and YouTube, saw paid clicks (how many times people clicked its ads) increase 8 percent year-over-year while cost-per-click, or how much it can charge for its ads, decreased 7 percent year-over-year. Properties revenues were nearly $22 billion. \nIts Network Members' properties, which includes third-party sites, saw its impressions increase 5 percent year-over-year and its cost-per-impression decrease 10 percent year-over-year. Network revenues were $4.6 billion. \nWhile Google's advertising business still pumps out the profits, Alphabet also breaks out the revenues and losses for its \"Other Bets,\" like healthcare company Verily and internet service provider Fiber. Other Bets posted Q1 revenue of $150 million on operating losses of $571 million. Previously, this was where Alphabet posted Nest revenues, which explains why r evenue declined from $409 million in Q4 . \nGoogle's total traffic acquisition costs, which includes the money it pays to phone manufacturers, like Apple, that use its services, like search, hit $6.28 billion, or 24 percent of Google's advertising revenues. That's up from 22 percent during Q1 2017. On the company's earnings call, chief financial officer Ruth Porat said that that increase reflects the fact that mobile search and programmatic advertising have higher TAC. \nAlphabet's operating expenses were $10.7 billion, which was up 27 percent year-over-year. Porat attributed that increase primarily to research and development. Meanwhile, its accrued capital expenditures were $7.7 billion, which is triple the expenditures for the same period in 2017 . Porat said included the $2.4 billion purchase of New York City's Chelsea Market building. \nThis story is developing — refresh for updates.
