    "text": "CONWAY, Ark., April 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Home BancShares, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOMB) (“Home” or “the Company”), and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Centennial Bank (“Centennial”), today announced the appointment of its Senior Executive Vice President, Donna Townsell, as Director of Investor Relations for Home. Ms. Townsell previously served as Director of Marketing for the Company.\n“Donna has played a major role in our company’s success and is a tremendous asset to the team,” said John W. Allison, Chairman. “She has proudly and successfully worn many hats for the Company over the years, which included Director of Corporate Efficiencies that was a game changer for the Company moving ratio’s from 60’s to 30’s, and we can rest assured that this role will be no different. Due to the increased regulations of growing over $10 billion, we believe it is prudent to have a dedicated Investor Relations Officer and Donna’s extensive knowledge of the Company and innovative background in marketing will help us improve our outreach and communication with current and prospective investors, research analysts and other important stakeholders.”\nAdditionally, the Company announced Andria Russaw will succeed Ms. Townsell as the Director of Marketing of Centennial Bank.

She is the mother of three adult children and resides in Conway.\n“Andria has been with the company almost nineteen years and will be a perfect person to step in as Director of Marketing. She is loyal, dedicated and smart. I look forward to working with her directly”, said Allison.\nGeneral\nHome BancShares, Inc. is a bank holding company, headquartered in Conway, Arkansas.
