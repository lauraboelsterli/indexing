    "text": "April 5, 2018 / 10:27 PM / Updated 23 minutes ago Qatar Emir to Meet Trump on April 10 - Qatar News Agency Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nCAIRO (Reuters) - Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani will meet U.S. President Donald Trump on April 10 in Washington, the state news agency QNA reported on late Thursday. \nTrump met with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House on March 21 and his meeting with Qatari Emir will be followed by a meeting with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed. \nThe White House said Trump would meet al-Thani to discuss ways to advance “common security and economic priorities” between the United States and Qatar. \nSaudi Arabia, the Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut off travel and trade ties with Qatar last June, accusing it of backing their archrival, Iran, and supporting terrorism. Qatar has denied the charges and has said the boycott was an attempt to impinge on its sovereignty and rein in its support for reform. Reporting by Mohamed El-Sherif; Editing by Toni Reinhold",
