    "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German retailer Otto Group could at some point list its fashion start-up About You on the stock exchange, Supervisory Board Chairman Michael Otto told a German newspaper.\nThe company last year said it was looking for a strategic partner for the unit to help fund international expansion, adding it had hired Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) find a buyer for a stake.\n“Currently we are looking for a strategic partner for our online shop About You to fuel its fast growth. That can be a retail company or an investor with experience in financial markets,” Michael Otto told Welt am Sonntag.\n“I do not rule out a public listing of About You at a later stage,” he added.\nOtto holds 94 percent of About You, while ProSiebenSat.1’s ( PSMGn.DE ) Seven Ventures and Berlin-based German Media Pool hold the remaining 6 percent.\nGerman newspaper Boersen-Zeitung last year said that About You was valued at around 320 million euros ($393 million) in a first round of financing.\n($1 = 0.8143 euros)\nReporting by Christoph Steitz; Editing by Stephen Powell\n ",
