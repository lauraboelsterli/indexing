    "text": "April 21, 2018 / 6:17 PM / Updated 37 minutes ago Macron calls Sisi to discuss Syrian crisis Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nCAIRO (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron called Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Saturday to discuss the Syrian crisis, Sisi’s office said. French President Emmanuel Macron attends a ceremony to pay tribute to Xavier Jugele one year after the French police officer was killed during a shooting incident, on the Champs Elysees avenue in Paris, France, April 20, 2018. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier/Pool \nMacron addressed the military strike that France, the United States and Britain launched in Syria a week ago, pointing out that it comes within the framework of international legitimacy, it said in a statement. \nThe three countries launched 105 missiles in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack in Syria, targeting what the Pentagon said were three chemical weapons facilities. \nSisi expressed his concern over military escalation in Syria, which he said would lead to further deterioration and add to the complexity of the situation. \nHe also “emphasized Egypt’s unyielding position that rejects the use of any internationally prohibited weapons on Syrian territories,” the statement said. \nHe stressed “the importance of conducting a transparent international investigation on the issue”. \nThe three Western countries said their strikes were limited to Syria’s chemical weapons capabilities and not aimed at toppling President Bashar al-Assad or intervening in the civil war. \nMacron had instructed French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian to visit Egypt by the end of this month to discuss ways to strengthen bilateral relations, the statement added.
