(Nasdaq:QNST), a leader in performance marketing products and technologies, today announced financial results for the third fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFor the third quarter, the Company reported revenue of $117.9 million, an increase of 49% year-over-year, and GAAP net income of $7.1 million, or $0.14 per diluted share. Adjusted net income for the third quarter was $8.5 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, and adjusted EBITDA was $11.2 million, or 10% of revenue, an increase of 116% over the year-ago period.\nThe Company generated $5.7 million in operating cash flow and $10.5 million in normalized free cash flow in the third quarter and closed the quarter with $47.1 million in cash and no debt.\n“Our business momentum accelerated again in FYQ3, driven by the continued success of our new product and media strategies,” commented Doug Valenti, QuinStreet CEO. “We set an all-time record in quarterly revenue and once again expanded margins. The new strategies are driving results and increased demand with clients and media partners, through enhanced matching, transparency and marketing effectiveness. Our business success has been driven by measurable performance for our clients and media partners, and by the competitive advantages of superior products and technologies.\"\n“We expect the positive momentum to continue and that FY 2018 revenue will be up at least 30% year-over-year with full-year adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 8%,” concluded Valenti.\nReconciliations of adjusted net income to GAAP net income, adjusted EBITDA to GAAP net income and normalized free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities are included in the accompanying tables.\nConference Call Today at 5:30 a.m. PT\nThe Company will host a conference call and corresponding live webcast at 5:30 a.m. PT today.

The term \"adjusted EBITDA\" refers to a financial measure that we define as net income (loss) less provision for (benefit from) taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, interest and other income, net, restructuring expense, external expenses related to the material weakness disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and acquisition related expense. The term \"adjusted net income\" refers to a financial measure that we define as net income (loss) adjusted for amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, restructuring expense, external expenses related to the material weakness disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and acquisition related expense, net of estimated taxes calculated based on the estimated annual statutory tax rate. Due to the effects of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance and our historical net operating losses, our annual effective tax rate is not meaningful as our income tax amounts for each period are not directly correlated to the amount of income or losses before income taxes for such period. The term \"adjusted diluted net income per share\" refers to a financial measure that we define as adjusted net income divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The term “free cash flow” refers to a financial measure that we define as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures and internal software development costs. The term “normalized free cash flow” refers to free cash flow less changes in operating assets and liabilities. These non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. In addition, our definition of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted net income per share, free cash flow and normalized free cash flow may not be comparable to the definitions as reported by other companies.\nWe believe adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per share are relevant and useful information because they provide us and investors with additional measurements to analyze the Company's operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA is useful to us and investors because (i) we seek to manage our business to a level of adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net revenue, (ii) it is used internally by us for planning purposes, including preparation of internal budgets; to allocate resources; to evaluate the effectiveness of operational strategies and capital expenditures as well as the capacity to service debt, (iii) it is a key basis upon which we assess our operating performance, (iv) it is one of the primary metrics investors use in evaluating Internet marketing companies, (v) it is a factor in determining compensation, and (vi) it is an element of certain financial covenants under our historical borrowing arrangements. In addition, we believe adjusted EBITDA and similar measures are widely used by investors, securities analysts, ratings agencies and other interested parties in our industry as a measure of financial performance, debt-service capabilities and as a metric for analyzing company valuations.\nWe use adjusted EBITDA as a key performance measure because we believe it facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by excluding potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or fluctuations in permanent differences or discrete quarterly items), non-recurring charges, certain other items that we do not believe are indicative of core operating activities (such as restructuring expense, external expenses related to the material weakness disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, acquisition related expense, and other income and expense) and the non-cash impact of depreciation expense, amortization expense and stock-based compensation expense.\nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per share are useful to us and investors because they present an additional measurement of our financial performance, taking into account depreciation, which we believe is an ongoing cost of doing business, but excluding the impact of certain non-cash expenses (stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets), non-recurring charges and certain other items that we do not believe are indicative of core operating activities. We believe that analysts and investors use adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per share as supplemental measures to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in our industry.\nFree cash flow is useful to investors and us because it represents the cash that our business generates from operations, before taking into account cash movements that are non-operational, and is a metric commonly used in our industry to understand the underlying cash generating capacity of a company’s financial model. Normalized free cash flow is useful as it removes the fluctuations in operating assets and liabilities that occur in any given quarter due to the timing of payments and cash receipts and therefore helps investors understand the underlying cash flow of the business as a quarterly metric and the cash flow generation potential of the business model. We believe that analysts and investors use free cash flow multiples as a metric for analyzing company valuations in our industry.\nWe intend to provide these non-GAAP financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and, therefore, the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to GAAP is provided in the accompanying tables.\nLegal Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements\nThis press release and its attachments contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that involve risks and uncertainties.
