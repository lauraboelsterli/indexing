    "text": "LONDON, April 13 (Reuters) - Russia’s rouble continued to gain ground on Friday but was still set for its worst week since August 2015 after a sharp sell off fuelled by sanctions and Syria tensions, while emerging stocks were on course for their first weekly gain in a month.\nInvestor sentiment improved after U.S. President Donald Trump tempered some of his remarks on Syria and trade, boosting beaten down currencies, and helping MSCI’s benchmark emerging stocks index to a gain of over 1 percent for the week.\nThe rouble firmed almost 1 percent, but was still set to end the week down around 5.6 percent after new U.S. sanctions against Russian businessmen and their companies.\nRussian stocks fell 0.8 percent and were on course for a weekly loss of 3.8 percent, their worst in a year.\nTensions between Moscow and Washington over Syria weighed on Russian assets mid-week, but Trump has since tempered his remarks about an imminent missile attack.\nThis helped soothe markets, with Russian five-year credit default swaps falling to 142 basis points according to IHS Markit, down 20 bps from an eight-month high of 162 bps on Wednesday.\nRussian sovereign dollar bond spreads also narrowed to 216 bps from a high of 233 bps on Tuesday, after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he stood by a January report advising against sanctioning Russian sovereign debt.\nBut Inan Demir, senior emerging economist at Nomura International, said the U.S. Treasury may have to revisit its assumptions if the geopolitical situation deteriorates.\n“We can be confident in the assumption that Russian sovereign debt won’t be sanctioned only as long as tensions with the West don’t escalate,” he said. “I am bit sceptical about the recovery in the rouble in that regard – it will require a benign geopolitical scenario playing out over coming weeks.”\nSurprisingly weak Chinese trade data meant emerging stocks dipped 0.2 percent on the day, with Chinese mainland stocks falling 0.7 percent.\nChina’s March exports were 2.7 percent lower versus a year ago, delivering a rare trade deficit of $4.98 billion, the first in over a year, although the trade surplus with the U.S. soared in the first quarter amidst an ongoing dispute with the United States.\nBut in a surprise move Trump asked his trade advisers to look at rejoining the Trans Pacific Partnership, a trade pact he withdrew from early last year.\nDemir said this was a significant change of tone as the market had been concerned about tit-for-tat tariffs by the U.S. and China. “A moderation of the rhetoric regarding the trade war has helped the broader emerging market sentiment although pockets of vulnerability remain,” he said.\nEmerging European stock markets were mixed, with Poland up 0.6 percent while Turkey remained under pressure, down 0.2 percent.\nThe Turkish lira rose 0.6 percent, but was still set to end the week down after being clobbered by economic concerns and Syria tensions. Sentiment improved towards the end of the week after policymakers said the central bank would take the necessary steps on the exchange rate.\nMexico’s peso strengthened 0.3 percent after the Mexican central bank held its key rate steady on Thursday as expected, as inflation cooled.\nBut Hong Kong’s dollar remained close to the weak end of its range even after the central bank intervened in the market for the first time since 2015 on Thursday.\nAdding to the central bank policy tightening momentum, Singapore tightened policy for the first time in six years.\nFor GRAPHIC on emerging market FX performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2e7eoml For GRAPHIC on MSCI emerging index performance 2018, see tmsnrt.rs/2dZbdP5\nFor TOP NEWS across emerging markets\nFor CENTRAL EUROPE market report, see\nFor TURKISH market report, see\nFor RUSSIAN market report, see) Emerging Markets Prices from Reuters Equities Latest Net Chg % Chg % Chg\non year\nMorgan Stanley Emrg Mkt Indx 1174.00 -2.88 -0.24 +1.34\nCzech Rep 1138.01 +6.23 +0.55 +5.55\nPoland 2319.88 +13.44 +0.58 -5.74\nHungary 38485.39 +155.02 +0.40 -2.27\nRomania 8912.70 -15.33 -0.17 +14.95\nGreece 811.67 +5.59 +0.69 +1.16\nRussia 1121.47 -3.62 -0.32 -2.86\nSouth Africa 49785.09 -23.86 -0.05 -5.23\nTurkey 10025.70 -209.71 -0.19 -4.60\nChina 3159.39 -20.77 -0.65 -4.47\nIndia 34214.54 +113.41 +0.33 +0.46\nCurrencies Latest Prev Local Local\nclose currency currency\n% change % change\nin 2018\nCzech Rep 25.31 25.30 -0.05 +0.84\nPoland 4.18 4.18 +0.01 -0.02\nHungary 310.81 311.12 +0.10 -0.09\nRomania 4.66 4.66 -0.02 +0.41\nSerbia 118.06 118.06 +0.00 +0.29\nRussia 61.46 61.96 +0.82 -6.18\nKazakhstan 327.05 328.45 +0.43 +1.76\nUkraine 26.16 25.98 -0.67 +7.61\nSouth Africa 12.05 12.05 -0.02 +2.51\nKenya 100.75 100.80 +0.05 +2.33\nIsrael 3.51 3.51 +0.07 -0.84\nTurkey 4.09 4.11 +0.56 -7.27\nChina 6.28 6.29 +0.12 +3.60\nIndia 65.24 65.28 +0.07 -2.16\nBrazil 3.41 3.41 +0.00 -2.94\nMexico 18.13 18.19 +0.31 +8.38\nDebt Index Strip Spd Chg %Rtn Index\nSov’gn Debt EMBIG 316 1 .04 7 94.83 1\nReporting by Claire Milhench Editing by Alison Williams\n ",
