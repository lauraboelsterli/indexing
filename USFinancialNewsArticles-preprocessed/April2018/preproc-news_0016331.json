Such forward-looking statements are based on the current beliefs, expectations and assumptions of Ceragon's management. Examples of forward-looking statements include: projections of revenues, net income, gross margin, capital expenditures and liquidity, competitive pressures, growth prospects, product development, financial resources, cost savings and other financial matters. You may identify these and other forward-looking statements by the use of words such as \"may\", \"plans\", \"anticipates\", \"believes\", \"estimates\", \"targets\", \"expects\", \"intends\", \"potential\" or the negative of such terms, or other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially, including risks associated with a decline in revenues due to our focus on a single market segment; risks relating to the concentration of Ceragon's business in certain geographic regions such as India, Latin America and in developing nations and the political, economic and regulatory risks from doing business in those regions, including potential currency restrictions; risks associated with a change in Ceragon's gross margin as a result of changes in the geographic mix of revenues; risks associated with the loss of a single customer or customer group, which represents a significant portion of Ceragon's revenues; risks associated with Ceragon's failure to effectively compete with other wireless equipment providers; and other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in Ceragon's Annual Report on Form 20-F and Ceragon's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that represent our views only as of the date they are made and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date.
