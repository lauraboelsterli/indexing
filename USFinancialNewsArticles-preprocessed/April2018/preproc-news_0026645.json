    "text": "April 14, 2018 / 11:22 AM / Updated 9 hours ago Volkswagen's new CEO may become Audi chairman in May - sources Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nBERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen’s ( VOWG_p.DE ) new Chief Executive Herbert Diess will likely take the helm of luxury division Audi’s ( NSUG.DE ) supervisory board next month, sources at VW group said. Herbert Diess, Volkswagen's new CEO poses after a news conference at the Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg, Germany April 13, 2018. REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer \nDiess, who has been head of Volkswagen’s (VW) core autos brand since 2015, replaced Matthias Mueller as CEO of VW group on Thursday after key stakeholders at Europe’s biggest automaker decided that sweeping changes at the multi-brand conglomerate should be spearheaded by a fresh CEO. \nDiess, a former executive at Audi’s luxury rival BMW ( BMWG.DE ), is expected to replace Mueller as chair of Audi’s 20-strong supervisory board at a meeting on May 8, one day before the brand’s annual general meeting, the sources said. \n“The supervisory board will take a decision on the chair at its next meeting,” a spokesman for Audi said, without elaborating. VW didn’t return calls seeking comment. \nGerman magazine Automobilwoche reported earlier on Saturday that Diess wants to become chairman of Audi, without citing the source of the information. \nThe supervisory board of Audi, the biggest profit engine at VW group, has traditionally been led by the VW group CEO.
