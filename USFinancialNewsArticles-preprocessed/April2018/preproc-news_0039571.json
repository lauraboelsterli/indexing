    "text": "Exceeded High-end of Revenue Guidance with EPS at Midpoint\nInitiated Integration of Accretive SOFT COMPANY Acquisition Converted Meaningful Pipeline Opportunities into New Contracted Business Continued Organic and Consolidated Revenue Growth Expected in the Second Quarter\nBUFFALO, N.Y., April 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CTG (NASDAQ:CTG), a leading provider of information technology (IT) solutions and services in North America and Western Europe, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 30, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Financial Summary\nRevenue was $82.8 million, above the high-end of guidance Revenue excluding three large staffing clients increased 15.2% year-over-year Organic revenue in Europe increased 10.1% year-over-year, excluding favorable currency translation GAAP net income was $422,000, or $0.03 per share, and non-GAAP earnings were $0.06 per diluted share, both at the midpoint of guidance\nFirst Quarter and Recent Business Highlights\nCompleted modified “Dutch Auction” tender offer, resulting in the purchase of approximately 1.5 million shares of its common stock Expanded existing share repurchase authorization by $10 million, providing additional capacity for potential future share buy backs beginning May 1 under federal securities laws Announced Board proposal to declassify the Board of Directors and transition to a single class of directors elected annually Appointed seasoned sales expert to lead North American sales efforts in Strategic Staffing and drive revenue growth Converted robust pipeline of opportunities into new business engagements within Strategic Staffing, Europe and Energy Secured three significant new client wins for Health Solutions\nCEO Comments on Financial Results and Strategic Growth\n“First quarter consolidated revenue grew nearly 11% sequentially to $82.8 million, above the high-end of guidance primarily due to continued strength in our European business including a partial quarter of revenue contribution from SOFT COMPANY. Additionally, revenue grew 15% excluding three of our large staffing clients where business continued to be soft,” stated Bud Crumlish, CTG President and CEO. “Earnings per share was at the mid-point of guidance, as we continued to drive operating improvements while incurring costs associated with the acquisition and integration of SOFT COMPANY, as well as an accelerated onboarding of headcount at our largest Staffing client in the last week of the quarter.”\n“Our primary strategic focus remains centered around generating growth at both new and existing clients. During the quarter, we successfully converted an increasing number of pipeline opportunities into signed engagements. In Staffing, we were designated as the sole service provider for incremental new service desk business at our largest staffing client and began transitioning resources in support of this work near the end of the quarter. This win is in addition to being selected as a preferred provider for a new division to provide support services at this long-standing client that we discussed last quarter. Additionally, we solidified several new engagements for our Application Advantage solution within Health Solutions, including two meaningful wins with notable hospital systems in the U.S., one of which is a highly ranked university medical center. In addition, we were awarded an EHR implementation engagement for a large health system for two of their hospitals. Our Energy business also performed well during the quarter, finalizing several new contracts on the heels of a sizeable multi-year engagement with an oil refinery at a leading energy company.”\n“In our European business, we had another solid quarter of organic growth combined with the addition of SOFT COMPANY’s business in France. We began integrating SOFT COMPANY, and have completed an initial alignment of the sales teams that will begin driving revenue through synergies between the two organizations and our complementary offerings. Also during the quarter, we signed our 10 th EHR implementation project in Europe while securing multiple new wins for our testing and general data protection regulation (GDPR) services.”\nMr. Crumlish further commented, “As part of our ongoing commitment to create shareholder value, the Company recently completed its previously announced tender offer, which resulted in the purchase of approximately 10% of CTG’s outstanding shares at an anticipated price of $8.85 per share as of April 18, 2018. To complement the tender offer, the Board also expanded our existing share repurchase authorization by $10 million to provide additional capacity for potential open market purchases going forward.”\n“Collectively, our results and progress during the first quarter demonstrate the initial return on the investments and strategic actions we’ve taken to grow the business, improve profitability and increase shareholder value. Looking forward, our top priorities remain executing on our plan and converting our robust pipeline into new contracted business in support of achieving our longer-term goals and financial targets.”\nConsolidated First Quarter Results\nRevenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $82.8 million, compared with $74.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $77.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. The sequential and year-over-year increase in revenue primarily reflects a combination of strength in CTG’s European business and a partial quarter of revenue contribution from the acquisition of SOFT COMPANY. Additionally, with the adoption of the new revenue recognition standards in the first quarter of 2018 under “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” the Company recorded approximately $1.5 million for the gross-up of revenue previously recorded on a net basis for billable subcontractors. Favorable currency translation benefited revenue in the first quarter by approximately $3.8 million, compared with a benefit of $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and an unfavorable impact of $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nDirect costs in the first quarter of 2018 were $66.9 million, or 80.8% of revenue, compared with $59.5 million, or 79.7% of revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $62.8 million, or 81.5% of revenue, in the first quarter of 2017. SG&A expense in the first quarter of 2018 was $15.3 million, which included $0.6 million in acquisition related costs and the SG&A costs associated with SOFT COMPANY, compared with $13.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $12.9 million in the 2017 first quarter.\nOperating income in the first quarter of 2018 was $594,000 or 0.7% of revenue. Excluding acquisition related expenses, non-GAAP operating income was $1.2 million or 1.4% of revenue. Operating income was $1.5 million, or 2.0% of revenue, in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $1.4 million, or 1.8% of revenue, in the first quarter of 2017.\nGAAP net income in the first quarter of 2018 was $422,000 or $0.03 per diluted share, which included $0.6 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, in acquisition related expenses. This income compared with a net loss in the fourth quarter of ($419,000) or ($0.03) per share, which included a $1.7 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, write down of deferred tax assets related to the enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and a non-taxable gain of $0.4 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, on the proceeds from a life insurance policy on a former CTG executive.\nNon-GAAP net income in the first quarter of 2018 was $889,000 or $0.06 per diluted share, compared with non-GAAP net income of $865,000, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017. Net income in the first quarter of 2017 was $751,000, or $0.05 per diluted share, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.\nCTG’s effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 was 21.9%, compared with 122.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 41.2% in the year-ago first quarter. The effective tax rate in 2018 primarily reflects a reduction in the statutory rate in the U.S. to 21% from 35% in 2017. The unusually high effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2017 was due to the charge related to the tax act that was partially offset by the non-taxable insurance gain.\nBalance Sheet\nCash and short-term investments at March 30, 2018 were $11.2 million, and the Company had $9.0 million in long-term debt. In April 2018, subsequent to quarter end, the Company borrowed $22.4 million against the cash surrender value of its life insurance policies, primarily to return capital to shareholders through the “Dutch Auction” tender offer, fund the acquisition of SOFT COMPANY, and for general working capital purposes. Days sales outstanding were 84 days in the first quarter of 2018, compared with 79 days in the first quarter of 2017.\nIn February 2018, the Company closed on the $1.8 million anticipated sale of a recently vacated office building, resulting in a recorded gain of less than $0.1 million in the first quarter of 2018.\nReconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Information\nThe Company has referenced non-GAAP information in this news release. The Company believes that the use of non-GAAP financial information provides useful information to investors and management to gain an overall understanding of its current financial performance and prospects. In addition, non-GAAP financial measures are used by management for forecasting and facilitating ongoing operating decisions, as well as measuring the Company’s overall performance. The Company believes that these non-GAAP measures align closely to its internal measurement processes and are reflective of the Company’s core operating results.\nSpecifically, the non-GAAP information for the first quarter of 2018 as presented excludes certain acquisition related expenses that the Company believes are not indicative of its core operating results. The reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP information for the first quarter ended March 30, 2018 is as follows:\n(in millions, except EPS) Operating\nIncome Operating\nMargin Net\nIncome Diluted\nEPS GAAP results $ 0.6 0.7 % $ 0.4 $0.03 Acquisition related expenses 0.6 0.7 % 0.5 0.03 Non-GAAP results $ 1.2 1.4 % $ 0.9 $0.06 Guidance and Outlook\nCTG provided the following guidance for the second quarter of 2018 and full year:\n2018 Second Quarter Guidance 2018 Full Year Guidance Revenue $87 to $91 million $343 to $357 million\nPreviously $340 to $360 million GAAP diluted EPS $0.05 to $0.09 $0.25 to $0.37\nPreviously $0.25 to $0.37 Non-GAAP diluted EPS $0.06 to $0.10 $0.30 to $0.42\nPreviously $0.30 to $0.42 Operating margin 1.5% to 1.9% 1.4% to 2.0% Note: Previous guidance provided on February 20, 2018 Acquisition related expenses and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets are excluded from non-GAAP guidance for diluted EPS.\nJohn M. Laubacker, CTG’s Chief Financial Officer, commented, “We are pleased to start the year with solid results, further highlighted by our expectations for continued growth in the second quarter. More specifically, we anticipate second quarter results will benefit from our ongoing focus on business development over the past several quarters as well as the recently secured engagement with our largest staffing client. Our early success in 2018 lends credence to the effectiveness of our strategic plan and the team’s consistent execution, both of which will serve to underpin our achievement of future revenue growth, improved profitability and increased shareholder value.”\nConference Call and Webcast\nCTG will hold a conference call today at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss its financial results and business outlook.
