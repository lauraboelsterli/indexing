    "text": "RockYou Media’s Progressive Business Model Gives Way to Property Expansion and Strengthens Destinations for Underserved Audiences\nLOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- RockYou Media, an entertainment and media company focused on amplifying the voices of multicultural millennials, announced today the acquisition and relaunch of LittleThings, a four-year-old digital publishing company anchored in feel-good, meaningful stories and videos that engaged a loyal following while reaching massive audiences.\nStarted in 2014, LittleThings began as a blog for a pet food ecommerce website and evolved into a popular hub for meaningful and inspiring content. Amassing over 24 million social followers, LittleThings expanded to rollout a steady stream of lifestyle content including real-life stories and videos, recipes and DIY projects. Reaching a total audience of nearly 60 million comScore unique monthly visitors, with seven million of those being millennials, the site’s exceptional video programming included the daily show “Refresh,” created and hosted by the millennial married couple Cassie and Paul Morris, and “The Hostess Next Door,” starring Chef Vanessa Cantave. LittleThings announced its last post to readers on February 28, 2018. As RockYou Media transitions LittleThings into the next phase of its life cycle, reengaging loyal followers and retaining audience engagement will be of utmost importance.\n“We are thrilled to revive LittleThings and re-engage its passionate and dedicated audience. We remain committed to the original values of the brand and will continue creating exceptional content for its followers, while expanding LittleThings onto new platforms,” said Lisa Marino, CEO, RockYou Media. “LittleThings is a terrific complement to Vocally.com and gives us further valuable insight into millennial habits as we move forward.”\nAs part of the LittleThings relaunch, RockYou Media will bring over key leaders of their executive team to keep consistency and continuity across content. RockYou Media will also retain members of the best-in-class content and social video team from LittleThings that contributed to building a digital property with such a dedicated and passionate following. While re-engaging the LittleThings audience by providing the type of content they know and love, RockYou Media is also setting out to attract new followers leveraging their stellar platform to spread the word and grow the channel’s footprint.\nMaia McCann joins RockYou Media as Editor-in-Chief and VP of Content. McCann served as LittleThings' Editor-in-Chief and EVP of Programming, where she led the creative teams from inception in 2014 through 2018. Awarded the honor of Rising Star by Folio's “Top Women In Media” in 2017, McCann is a frequent speaker on digital distribution, social growth and video content. Prior to LittleThings, McCann worked for Distractify, and as a New Media Artist sponsored by the New York Foundation for the Arts.\nMatthew Mirman joins RockYou Media as VP of Revenue Operations and Monetization Strategy. As LittleThings’ Executive Vice President of Partnerships, Mirman was responsible for spearheading content syndication and video licensing businesses. Mirman’s experience also includes roles at Dedicated Media as Vice President and Epic Advertising as General Manager, Publisher Development and Distribution, as well as MediaCom, one of the world’s largest strategic media planning and buying companies and a unit of WPP’s GroupM.\nLed by a female team of experienced media visionaries, RockYou Media breaks down traditional barriers by delivering compelling editorial and video content to empower those voices who have traditionally not had the platform to speak up. Pairing new brands such as Vocally , which launched earlier this year and is geared toward females and multicultural millennials ages 18-34, along with LittleThings, RockYou Media continues its prominence by building an innovative platform focused on capturing compelling, blended content of storytelling and meaningful features that resonate across our highly diverse and engaged audiences.\nAbout RockYou Media\nFounded in 2005, RockYou Media is an interactive media and entertainment company, built around a proprietary platform, RYME, amplifying the authentic voice of multicultural millennials. RockYou Media provides brands and publishers with hyper-engaging content, with a video portfolio that reaches 75 million monthly viewers, developed and optimized by publishers of leading social media apps.
