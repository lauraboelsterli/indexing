    "text": "Published: Apr 11, 2018 6:34 a.m. ET Share \nLawmakers aren’t planning vote to authorize military force even as Senate committee prepares to debate rewriting 16-year-old law that underpins war on terrorism Reuters Charirman Bob Corker and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee this month will begin debating a rewrite of the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists—a law that has provided the legal backbone for military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, the Philippines, Georgia, Yemen, Djibouti, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Somalia. \nBy Byron Tau \nWASHINGTON—Top lawmakers on Capitol Hill said they won’t vote on authorizing retaliatory U.S. military strikes against Syria over a purported chemical-weapons attack, sidestepping a longstanding and messy debate about what role Congress should play in foreign policy. \nA number of members in both parties said President Donald Trump possesses the authority to conduct limited, surgical strikes against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in response to the Saturday attack that killed dozens of civilians. \nAnd: Airlines warned of possible airstrikes in Syria over next 72 hours \n“I think for a surgical strike, they easily have the authority to do it,” said Sen. Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \nDemocratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire agreed. “To initiate the kinds of missile strike he did last year? I think he has the authority to do that,” she said. \nThe lack of congressional interest in a debate on Syria strikes comes as Congress is about to reopen a long-simmering debate on the 16-year-old law that underpins the war on terrorism.
