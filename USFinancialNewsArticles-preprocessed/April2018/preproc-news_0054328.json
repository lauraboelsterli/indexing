Total assets under management at March 31, 2018, which included $1.6 billion of assets in liquidity strategies, were $89.1 billion.\nTotal sales increased 32 percent sequentially to $5.4 billion, reflecting higher sales in open-end funds and the issuance of a $0.4 billion Collateralized Loan Obligation (CLO). When compared to the prior-year quarter, total sales increased 66 percent due to higher sales in open-end funds, structured products, and institutional.\nMutual fund sales of $3.8 billion increased 43 percent sequentially and 86 percent over the prior-year quarter, primarily reflecting continued growth in sales in domestic equity strategies. Higher sales in fixed income and international equity strategies also contributed to the sequential-quarter increase.\nTotal net flows improved modestly to ($0.7) billion from ($0.8) billion sequentially, as positive contributions from structured products, open-end funds, and ETFs were offset primarily by net outflows in institutional accounts. Net outflows in institutional were largely the result of partial redemptions in existing client accounts in high yield and option strategies.\nMutual fund net flows were positive $0.1 billion, an improvement from ($0.6) billion sequentially and ($0.1) billion in the prior-year quarter, due primarily to net inflows in domestic equity strategies and improved net flows in fixed income strategies, primarily bank loans.\nGAAP Results\nOperating income decreased sequentially to $22.6 million from $28.0 million as seasonally higher employment costs more than offset a 7 percent decrease in other operating expenses and a 1 percent increase in revenues. First-quarter operating expenses included $3.1 million of acquisition and integration costs, a decrease from $3.4 million in the fourth quarter.\nIncome tax expense of $6.5 million decreased 73 percent from the fourth quarter, which included a $13.1 million non-cash charge that reflected the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nFirst-quarter net income per diluted share of $2.77 included $0.32 of realized and unrealized gains on investments, ($0.58) of seasonally higher employment expenses, and ($0.26) of acquisition and integration costs. Fourth-quarter net income per diluted share of $0.46 included ($1.76) from the tax charge, ($0.30) of realized and unrealized losses on investments, and ($0.28) of acquisition and integration costs.\nWeighted average diluted shares outstanding increased 13 percent to 8.4 million from 7.4 million sequentially, primarily as a result of the calculation of the \"if-converted\" method in the quarter, which determined that the impact of the assumed conversion of the preferred shares was more dilutive than the deduction of preferred dividends from net income.\nNon-GAAP Results\nRevenues, as adjusted, of $108.3 million decreased 1 percent sequentially, as the impact of both higher average assets and a blended fee rate were offset by two fewer days in the quarter. Operating expenses, as adjusted, increased sequentially due to higher employment expenses, as adjusted, primarily due to $6.8 million of seasonally higher employment expenses, including payroll taxes and benefits related to the timing of annual incentive payments. Other operating expenses, as adjusted, decreased by $1.0 million from the prior quarter, which included $0.9 million of transaction costs related to the pending investment in Sustainable Growth Advisers (SGA).\nOperating income, as adjusted, and the related margin were $32.8 million and 30 percent, respectively, compared with $39.1 million and 36 percent in the sequential quarter. Excluding the $6.8 million of seasonally higher expenses, operating income, as adjusted, and the related margin were $39.6 million and 37 percent, respectively.\nNet income attributable to common stockholders, as adjusted, was $21.8 million, which included a $0.6 million increase in other income, as adjusted, related to earnings on equity method investments. Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted, were $2.59 compared with $2.60 sequentially, as the impact of the seasonally higher employment expenses were offset by a lower effective tax rate, as adjusted, and the increase in other income, as adjusted.\nInterest and dividends earned on seed and CLO investments, which are not included in net income, as adjusted, were $3.4 million, an increase from $2.6 million in the prior quarter.\nThe effective tax rate, as adjusted, was 28 percent, a decrease from 39 percent in the sequential quarter, reflecting the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nSelect Balance Sheet Items (Unaudited)\n(in millions)\nAs of\nAs of\n3/31/2018\n3/31/2017\nChange\n12/31/2017\nChange\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n80.8\n$\n235.9\n(66%)\n$\n132.1\n(39%)\nDebt\n$\n245.4\n$\n—\nN/M\n$\n248.3\n(1%)\nTotal equity attributable to stockholders\n$\n608.8\n$\n552.4\n10%\n$\n588.5\n3%\nWorking capital (1)\n$\n82.9\n$\n224.8\n(63%)\n$\n76.3\n9%\nNet debt (cash) (2)\n$\n177.9\n$\n(235.9)\nN/M\n$\n127.2\n40%\n(1) Defined as cash and cash equivalents plus accounts receivable, net, less accrued compensation and benefits, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, dividends payable, and contingent consideration\n(2) Defined as gross debt less cash and cash equivalents\nN/M - Not Meaningful\nCash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2018 decreased 39 percent from December 31, 2017, due primarily to the timing of annual incentive payments and an investment in the newly issued CLO that more than offset cash generated.\nThe net leverage ratio, which is net debt to EBITDA (in accordance with the company's credit agreement), was 1.0x at March 31, 2018 compared with 0.7x at December 31, 2017.\nIn February, the company refinanced its term loan and secured an additional $105.0 million of term loan debt that will be drawn at the closing of the pending investment in SGA. The refinancing lowered the variable rate of interest on the existing term loan and increased the company's financial flexibility by removing a financial maintenance covenant.\nConference Call\nVirtus Investment Partners management will host an investor conference call on Friday, April 27, at 10 a.m. Eastern to discuss these financial results and related matters.

Distribution and other asset-based expenses - Primarily payments to third-party distribution partners and third-party service providers for providing services to investors in our sponsored funds and payments to third-party service providers for investment management-related services. Management believes that making this adjustment aids in comparing the company's operating results with other asset management firms that do not utilize intermediary distribution partners or third-party service providers.\n2. Consolidated investment products - Revenues and expenses generated by operating activities of majority-owned mutual funds and CLOs that are consolidated in the financial statements. Management believes that excluding these operating activities to reflect net revenues and expenses of the company prior to the consolidation of these products is consistent with the approach of reflecting its operating results from managing third-party client assets.\n3. Amortization of intangible assets - Non-cash amortization expense or impairment expense, if any, attributable to acquisition-related intangible assets. Management believes that making this adjustment aids in comparing the company's operating results with other asset management firms that have not engaged in acquisitions.\n4. Acquisition and integration expenses - Expenses that are directly related to acquisition and integration activities. Acquisition expenses include transaction closing costs, certain professional fees, and financing fees. Integration expenses include costs incurred that are directly attributable to combining businesses, including compensation, restructuring and severance charges, professional fees, consulting fees, and other expenses. Management believes that making these adjustments aids in comparing the company's operating results with other asset management firms that have not engaged in acquisitions.\nComponents of Acquisition and Integration Expenses for the respective periods are shown in the table below:\nThree Months Ended\nAcquisition and Integration Expenses\n3/31/2018\n3/31/2017\n12/31/2017\nEmployment expenses\n$\n1,903\n$\n—\n$\n2,009\nRestructuring and severance\n—\n—\n102\nOther operating expenses\n1,189\n1,629\n1,269\nInterest expense\n40\n—\n—\nTotal Acquisition and Integration Expenses\n$\n3,132\n$\n1,629\n$\n3,380\n5. Other - Certain expenses that are not reflective of the ongoing earnings generation of the business. In addition, it includes income tax expense (benefit) items, such as adjustments for uncertain tax positions, changes in tax law, valuation allowances and other unusual or infrequent items not related to current operating results to reflect a normalized effective rate. Preferred dividends are adjusted as the shares are mandatorily convertible into common shares at the end of three years and the non-GAAP weighted average shares are adjusted to reflect the conversion. Management believes that making these adjustments aids in comparing the company's operating results with prior periods.\nComponents of Other for the respective periods are shown in the table below:\nThree Months Ended\nOther\n3/31/2018\n3/31/2017\n12/31/2017\nSystem transition expenses\n$\n(20)\n$\n669\n$\n256\nTax impact of system transition expenses\n6\n(258)\n(100)\nTax impact of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\n—\n—\n13,059\nOther discrete tax adjustments\n(894)\n(286)\n(910)\nTotal tax related items\n$\n(888)\n$\n(544)\n$\n12,049\nPreferred stockholder dividends\n2,084\n2,084\n2,084\nTotal Other\n$\n1,176\n$\n2,209\n$\n14,389\n6. Seed capital and CLO investments earnings (loss) - Gains and losses (realized and unrealized), dividends and interest income generated by seed capital and CLO investments. Earnings or losses generated by investments in seed capital and CLO investments can vary significantly from period to period and do not reflect the company's operating results from providing investment management and related services. Management believes that making this adjustment aids in comparing the company's operating results with prior periods and with other asset management firms that do not have meaningful seed capital and CLO investments.\nDefinitions:\nRevenues, as adjusted, comprise the fee revenues paid by clients for investment management and related services. Revenues, as adjusted, for purposes of calculating net income attributable to common stockholders, as adjusted, differ from U.S. GAAP revenues in that they are reduced by distribution and other asset-based expenses that are generally passed through to external parties, and exclude the impact of consolidated investment products.\nOperating expenses, as adjusted, is calculated to reflect expenses from ongoing continuing operations. Operating expenses, as adjusted, for purposes of calculating net income attributable to common stockholders, as adjusted, differ from U.S. GAAP expenses in that they exclude amortization or impairment, if any, of intangible assets, restructuring and severance, the impact of consolidated investment products, acquisition and integration-related expenses and certain other expenses that do not reflect the ongoing earnings generation of the business.\nOperating margin, as adjusted, is a metric used to evaluate efficiency represented by operating income, as adjusted, divided by revenues, as adjusted.\nEarnings (loss) per share, as adjusted, represent net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, as adjusted, divided by weighted average shares outstanding, as adjusted, on either a basic or diluted basis.\nForward-Looking Information\nThis press release contains statements that are, or may be considered to be, forward-looking statements.
