    "text": "BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Europe should be based on strong nation states, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of Poland’s governing Law and Justice (PiS) party, said on Friday, adding that his country’s joint path with Hungary would lead their nations to freedom.\nJaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of the ruling party Law and Justice, arrives for a news conference in Warsaw, Poland April 5, 2018. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel Kaczynski, Poland’s paramount leader, also urged Hungarians to back Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban in a national election taking place on Sunday.\n“The day after tomorrow, you will decide about freedom,” Kaczynski said at the unveiling of a statue to commemorate a plane crash near Smolensk that killed Poland’s president and 95 other people in 2010.\n“The dignity and freedom of nations is closely linked to Viktor Orban’s name not just for Hungarians, but for Poles as well,” Kaczynski said through an interpreter.\nReporting by Krisztina Than and Gergely Szakacs; editing by John Stonestreet\n ",
