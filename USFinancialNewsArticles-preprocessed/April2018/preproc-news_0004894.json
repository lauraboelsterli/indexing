    "text": "April 4, 2018 / 6:03 AM / Updated an hour ago Cambodia invites foreign observers to election after dissolving opposition Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nPHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia on Wednesday invited foreign observers to monitor a July general election, as required by law, which long-serving Prime Minister Hun Sen is poised to win after the main opposition party was dissolved. \nThe National Election Committee said the foreign observers would have to submit written reports on their findings. \nKoul Panha, director of the Committee for Free and Fair Elections in Cambodia, an election watchdog, said international observers should think before accepting. \n“They should be more cautious in responding to the invitation. Many of them have standards on prerequisite principles for their engagement decision,” he said. \nHun Sen and his supporters have waged a campaign against critics, including members of the opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), in what opponents say is a bid to prolong his leadership after 33 years in office. \nThe CNRP was dissolved and its lawmakers banned from politics in November after the Supreme Court ruled that it had tried to overthrow the government - something the CNRP has denied. \nThe CNRP dissolution was followed by the arrest of CNRP leader Kem Sokha for plotting to overthrow the government with U.S. help, an accusation both the United States and Kem Sokha have rejected.
