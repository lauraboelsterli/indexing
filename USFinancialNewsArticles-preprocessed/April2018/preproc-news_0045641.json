    "text": "April 23, 2018 / 5:27 AM / Updated 22 minutes ago Waffle House shooting suspect arrested by Nashville police Tim Ghianni 4 Min Read \nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (Reuters) - Nashville police on Monday arrested the suspect in the weekend killing of four people at a Waffle House restaurant, ending a manhunt that began when the gunman ran naked from the scene into nearby woods, authorities said. \nPhotos posted online by police showed Travis Reinking, a 29-year-old construction worker suspected of opening fire at the restaurant early Sunday morning, in the back of a police car. Looking dishevelled, he was wearing a torn red shirt and dirty blue jeans, and had scratches on his shoulder. \n“Murder suspect Travis Reinking is in custody. Arrested moments ago,” the Metro Nashville Police wrote in a Twitter message. No further details about the arrest were immediately available. \nEarlier on Monday, police in the Tennessee capital said a passerby found an empty laptop case outside the restaurant, and it was uncertain whether it got there before or after the shooting, leading authorities to widen their search for Reinking. \nPolice said they did not know what the gunman’s motive was in opening fire at the 24-hour chain restaurant. \n“We don’t know why he went into the Waffle House,” spokesman Don Aaron told reporters said. Related Coverage Suspect was delusional before Nashville shootings - police reports \nAsked whether the shootings were racially motivated because all four people killed were black, Aaron said he did not know. \nReinking had also stolen a BMW car from a dealership last week in a neighbouring county, which was later recovered from outside his apartment building, Aaron said. Before the shooting, police had no suspect in the theft, but later found the key fob in Reinking’s apartment. The spokesman said it was unclear whether the car theft was connected to the Waffle House attack. \nIn Reinking’s hometown in Tazewell County, Illinois, police released incident reports about Reinking from the last couple of years. They showed he had multiple encounters with law enforcement about his delusions that people, including singer Taylor Swift, were following him. \nDuring the shootings, the suspect was wearing only a green jacket that he shed before leaving on foot, police said. That jacket contained two clips of ammunition for the assault-style rifle used in the shootings, police and school officials said.

Courtesy Metro Nashville Police Department/Handout via REUTERS \nThe killings in Tennessee’s capital were the latest in a string of high-profile U.S. mass shootings in which a gunman used an AR-15 rifle. A nationwide debate on gun control has intensified since February, when a former student killed 17 people with an AR-15 at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. BIZARRE ENCOUNTERS \nAfter multiple bizarre encounters with law enforcement, including an episode in Washington in July 2017 where Reinking was arrested for trying to get into the White House, law enforcement revoked his Illinois-issued licence to carry concealed weapons, according to police records. \nReinking’s father promised police he would lock up his son’s guns, which police say included the AR-15 rifle used in the Waffle House shooting. But the father relented and returned the weapons to his son, Nashville police said on Sunday. \nTwo people were shot dead outside the restaurant at about 3:30 a.m. (0730 GMT) on Sunday, and two were killed inside. The suspect fled after a 29-year-old diner, James Shaw Jr., wrestled the rifle from him. \nShaw, who was grazed by a bullet during the attack, was praised by authorities for his courage, but on Sunday he denied he was a hero. “I just wanted to live,” he said.

Sanderlin, 29, and three patrons: Joe R. Perez, 20; DeEbony Groves, 21; and Akilah Dasilva, 23. \nTwo wounded patrons were being treated at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, and both were in stable condition early on Monday.
