    "text": "Peter Bourjos delivered a two-run single in the top of the 12th inning that gave the Atlanta Braves a 5-3 victory over the host Washington Nationals in a Wednesday matinee game.\nKurt Suzuki smacked two solo homers for the Braves.\nOzzie Albies and Freddie Freeman led off the 12th with singles off Ryan Madson (0-1). Nick Markakis then walked to load the bases.\nOne out later, Bourjos hit a soft single to short right that scored Albies and Freeman for a 5-3 lead.\nBourjos was 0-for-11 this season before today’s contest and went 2-for-3 after entering in the seventh.\nDespite blowing a save chance in the 11th, Shane Carle (2-1) threw the final two innings and earned the win.\nAtlanta starter Brandon McCarthy left after five innings due to a partial dislocation of his left — non-throwing — shoulder. McCarthy was covering first base and got hurt when reaching back to catch the throw from Freeman.\nMcCarthy departed and the Braves (7-5) said later that he was day-to-day.\nAlbies gave the Braves a 1-0 lead in the first with his homer off Washington starter A.J. Cole.\nTrea Turner tied it with an RBI single off McCarthy in the third. Suzuki gave Atlanta a 2-1 edge with a solo homer off Cole with two outs in the top of the fourth.\nThe Nationals nearly tied it in the seventh but left fielder Bourjos threw out Matt Adams at the plate after pinch hitter Wilmer Difo singled.\nWashington finally tied it in the ninth when Adams hit a solo homer off Arodys Vizcaino with one out.\nThe Braves nearly won the game in the 10th when Ender Inciarte walked and later stole second and third. Inciarte also tried to steal home but pitcher Sean Doolittle gunned him down on a play that was reviewed and upheld.\nSuzuki gave the Braves a 3-2 lead in the top of the 11th on his second homer. However, Howie Kendrick tied it with a two-out double in the bottom half.\nWashington (6-6) brought back catcher Matt Wieters (mild oblique strain) from the 10-day disabled list and selected the contract of outfielder Moises Sierra before the game.\nThe Nationals also put outfielder Adam Eaton on the disabled list (retroactive to April 9, left ankle bone bruise) and designated catcher Miguel Montero for assignment.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
