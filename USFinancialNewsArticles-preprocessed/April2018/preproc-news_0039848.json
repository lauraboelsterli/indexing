    "text": "AMESBURY, Mass., April 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Provident Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) (Nasdaq:PVBC), the holding company for The Provident Bank (the “Bank”), reported net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 of $2.0 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, compared to $1.8 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\n“As we continue on our path as a high-performing and rapidly growing organization, The Provident is directing energies inward by implementing Lean management principles. By improving and streamlining our internal processes, and reducing waste and redundancy, we can continue to provide an exceptional customer experience. We were recently awarded a grant, funded through the Massachusetts Workforce Training Fund in conjunction with the Massachusetts Banker’s Association (MBA) to provide Lean training for our employees. This program is an excellent forum to engage and empower our workforce, grow leaders and build teamwork. I am excited to provide this growth-opportunity to our team as they learn to use Lean methods to add significant value to our organization and the customers we serve,” said David Mansfield, Chief Executive Officer of The Provident.\nNet interest and dividend income before provision for loan losses increased by $1.4 million, or 18.9%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017. The growth in net interest and dividend income is primarily the result of an increase in our average interest earning assets of $62.4 million, or 8.1%, and an increase in net interest margin of 38 basis points to 4.17%.\nProvisions for loan losses of $656,000 were booked for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $563,000 for the same period in 2017. The changes in the provision were based on management’s assessment of loan portfolio growth and composition changes, historical charge-off trends, levels of problem loans and other asset quality trends.\nThe allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was 1.33% as of March 31, 2018 compared to 1.30% as of December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non-performing loans was 106.80% as of March 31, 2018 compared to 108.02% as of December 31, 2017. Non-performing assets were $9.6 million, or 1.08% of total assets as of March 31, 2018 compared to $9.0 million, or 1.00% of total assets as of December 31, 2017. The non-performing assets at March 31, 2018 consist primarily of two loan relationships. The relationships were evaluated for impairment and charge-offs of $1.5 million were recorded in 2017. No additional impairment was recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nNoninterest income decreased $489,000, or 32.6% to $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $1.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease is primarily due to decreased gains on sales of securities.\nNoninterest expense increased $755,000, or 13.4%, to $6.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $5.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The primary reason for the increase was salary and employee benefits expense. The increase of $482,000, or 13.1%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 in salary and employee benefits was primarily due to a higher number of lenders compared to March 31, 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, total assets have decreased $11.1 million, or 1.2%, to $891.2 million compared to $902.3 million at December 31, 2017. The primary reason for the decrease is due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents partially offset by an increase in net loans. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $25.4 million, or 53.2%, resulted from utilizing funds for loan growth and decreases of deposits. Net loans increased $17.7 million, or 2.4%, to $759.9 million as of March 31, 2018 compared to $742.1 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in net loans was due to an increase in commercial loans of $19.8 million, or 8.2%.\nTotal liabilities decreased $12.6 million, or 1.6%, due to decreased deposits offset by increased borrowings. Deposits were $719.7 million as of March 31, 2018 representing a decrease of $30.4 million, or 4.0%, compared to December 31, 2017. The primary reason for the decrease in deposits was due to a decrease of $19.6 million, or 6.3%, in NOW and demand deposits, a decrease of $7.5 million, or 7.4%, time deposits, and a decrease in money market deposits of $5.7 million, or 2.5%. The decrease in the NOW and demand deposits is primarily municipal deposits. They are expected to increase in the next quarter. The time deposits reduced primarily due to the roll-off of brokered CDs. Borrowings increased $18.4 million, or 68.4%, due to the decrease in deposits.\nAs of March 31, 2018, shareholders’ equity was $117.3 million compared to $115.8 million at December 31, 2017 representing an increase of $1.6 million, or 1.3%. The increase is primarily due to net income of $2.0 million for the year.\nAbout Provident Bancorp, Inc.\nProvident Bancorp, Inc. is a Massachusetts corporation that was formed in 2011 by The Provident Bank to be its holding company.
