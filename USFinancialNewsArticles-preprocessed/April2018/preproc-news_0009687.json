The Ford logo is seen at the New York Auto Show in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., March 29, 2018. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton \n“The European Central Bank has approved Ford Credit Europe (FCE) Bank’s application for a banking license in Germany. We expect to establish this bank in the second half 2018,” a spokesman said. \nFCE sought a German banking licence, to run alongside its existing British one, last year because the future of passporting, which allows financial firms to serve the whole EU from a single base, is uncertain after Brexit. \nFCE has said it would keep its headquarters in Britain and that the plan would not include job losses or significant changes to where employees are based. \nFCE, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Ford, provides financial services to dealers, retail, fleet and business customers in Britain and 11 other countries in Europe.
