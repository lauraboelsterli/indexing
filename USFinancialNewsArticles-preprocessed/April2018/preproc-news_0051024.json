    "text": "SUFFOLK, Va., TowneBank (the “Bank” or “Company”) (NASDAQ: TOWN) today reported record financial results of $24.71 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $21.97 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nExcluding acquisition-related expenses, earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $31.79 million (non-GAAP), or $0.46 (non-GAAP) per diluted share, compared to the $22.04 million (non-GAAP), or $0.35 (non-GAAP) per diluted share, earned in the same period of 2017.\n“Our results for the first quarter were a reflection of our strong operating performance and top-line growth as we successfully completed our merger with Paragon Commercial Corporation and continued to build on the momentum from last year,” said G. Robert Aston, Jr., Executive Chairman. “We continued to experience strong credit results, a widening of net interest margin, and strong capital and liquidity levels while producing revenue growth of 20.07% and a return on average assets of 1.02% . ”\nHighlights for the First Quarter of 2018 Compared to the First Quarter of 2017:\nTotal revenues were $126.28 million, an increase of $21.11 million, or 20.07%. Successful closing of the merger with Paragon Commercial Corporation (\"Paragon\") resulted in the addition of loans of $1.43 billion and deposits of $1.25 billion. Loans held for investment increased $1.56 billion, or 26.33%, from March 31, 2017, and $1.52 billion, or 25.61%, from December 31, 2017. Excluding loans acquired in the Paragon merger of $1.43 billion, loans increased $90.69 million, or 6.18% annualized, from December 31, 2017. Total deposits were $7.83 billion, an increase of $1.63 billion, or 26.40%. Noninterest bearing deposits increased by 21.96%, to $2.50 billion, representing 31.99% of total deposits. Annualized return of average tangible common shareholders' equity (non-GAAP) of 11.77%. Taxable equivalent net interest margin of 3.54%, up 9 basis points. Effective tax rate of 19.74% benefiting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\n“During the first quarter, we successfully completed the integration and systems conversion process related to the Paragon merger, and we are extremely excited about the transformational opportunity provided by the merger as we enter the robust Raleigh and Charlotte, North Carolina markets,” said J. Morgan Davis, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nQuarterly Net Interest Income Compared to the First Quarter of 2017:\nNet interest income was $76.34 million compared to $60.28 million at March 31, 2017. Taxable equivalent net interest margin was 3.54%, including accretion of 15 basis points, compared to 3.45%, including accretion of 9 basis points, for 2017. Total cost of deposits increased to 0.53% from 0.40% at March 31, 2017. Average interest-earning assets totaled $8.81 billion at March 31, 2018 compared to $7.18 billion at March 31, 2017, an increase of 22.74%.

Average interest-bearing liabilities totaled $6.03 billion, an increase of $1.20 billion from prior year.\nThe following table sets forth an estimate of the expected effects of the estimated aggregate acquisition accounting adjustments on pre-tax net interest income for the periods shown (in thousands):\nDiscount Accretion (Premium Amortization) For the three months ended June 30, September 30, December 31, March 31, 2018 2018 2018 2019 Assets: Investment Securities $ (75 ) $ (72 ) $ (71 ) $ (72 ) Loans 2,506 2,229 1,703 1,611 Liabilities: Deposits 128 104 91 60 Total estimated effect on net interest income $ 2,303 $ 2,053 $ 1,541 $ 1,479 Note: This information is intended for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of future results. Actual results may differ due to factors such as changes in estimated prepayment speeds or projected credit loss rates. Quarterly Provision for Loan Losses:\nRecorded a provision for loan losses of $1.95 million compared to $0.87 million in the prior quarter and $2.54 million a year ago. Net charge-offs were $0.35 million compared to $1.35 million one year prior. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans on an annualized basis was 0.02% compared to 0.01% in the prior quarter and 0.09% for the first quarter of 2017. The allowance for loan losses represented 0.63% of total loans compared to 0.76% at December 31, 2017 and 0.73% at March 31, 2017. Loan loss reserve as a percentage of total loans, excluding purchased loans, remained steady at 0.86%, unchanged from December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses was 10.40 times nonperforming loans compared to 9.39 times at December 31, 2017 and 3.74 times at March 31, 2017.\nQuarterly Noninterest Income Compared to the First Quarter of 2017:\nTotal noninterest income was $49.93 million compared to $44.89 million, an increase of $5.05 million. This reflects increases of $5.44 million in real estate brokerage and property management income and $0.41 million in service charges on deposit accounts offset by a decrease of $1.43 million in insurance commissions and other title fees primarily related to the timing of revenue due to the adoption of the new accounting guidance on revenue recognition. Property management fee revenue increased $5.20 million, or 147.13%, primarily related to the purchase of a resort property management company in April 2017 and a change in the timing of revenue recognition due to the adoption of new accounting guidance on revenue recognition. The change in accounting guidance resulted in an increase of property management fee income for the first quarter of approximately $3.04 million. Insurance segment total revenue decreased 6.87% to $15.69 million due to a change in the timing of revenue recognition related to the adoption of new accounting guidance on revenue recognition. The change in accounting guidance resulted in a reduction of insurance commission revenue for the first quarter of approximately $2.13 million. Residential mortgage banking income was $17.60 million compared to $17.63 million in first quarter 2017. Loan volume in the current quarter was $703.20 million, with purchases comprising $574.90 million and refinancing activity accounting for $128.30 million. Loan volume in first quarter 2017 was $706.06 million, with purchase activity of $576.86 million and refinancing activity of $129.20 million.\nQuarterly Noninterest Expense Compared to the First Quarter of 2017:\nTotal noninterest expense was $92.30 million compared to $70.25 million, an increase of $22.06 million, or 31.40%. This reflects increases of $10.87 million in salary and benefits expense, $8.73 million in acquisition-related expenses, $0.73 million in intangible amortization expense, $0.49 million in outside processing fees, and $0.36 million in furniture and equipment expense. Noninterest expense included operational expenses of entities acquired subsequent to first quarter 2017, including Paragon bank division expenses of $5.70 million, acquired resort property management company expenses of $1.83 million, and acquired insurance agency expenses of $0.46 million.\nQuarterly Income Taxes Compared to the First Quarter of 2017:\nIncome tax expense was $6.08 million compared to $9.39 million, one year prior. This represents an effective tax rate of 19.74% compared to 29.94% in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in the effective tax rate from the prior year is due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, signed into law on December 22, 2017. The reduction from 35% to 21% of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate was among the key changes to U.S. tax law, effective January 1, 2018.\nInvestment Securities:\nTotal investment securities were $1.34 billion compared to $958.55 million at December 31, 2017 and $822.19 million at March 31, 2017. The carrying value of the available-for-sale portfolio included $17.95 million of net unrealized losses compared to $6.43 million at December 31, 2017, and $4.62 million in net unrealized losses at March 31, 2017.
