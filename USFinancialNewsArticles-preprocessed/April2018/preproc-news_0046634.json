    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, Dolby Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:DLB) today announced the Company's financial results for the second quarter (Q2) of fiscal 2018. For the second quarter, Dolby reported total revenue of $301.4 million, compared to $267.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\n“We had another solid quarter with growth in several areas,” said Kevin Yeaman, President and CEO, Dolby Laboratories. “Both Samsung and Huawei adopted Dolby Atmos into their mobile phones, and we have continued expansion of Dolby Cinema entering Japan and adding another major exhibitor in China.”\nSecond quarter GAAP net income was $70.6 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, compared to net income of $50.6 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. On a non-GAAP basis, second quarter net income was $83.5 million, or $0.78 per diluted share, compared to $65.1 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Dolby's non-GAAP measures are described and reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures at the end of this release.\nDividend\nToday, Dolby announced a cash dividend of $0.16 per share of Class A and Class B common stock, payable on May 16, 2018, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 7, 2018.\nFinancial Outlook\nQ3 Fiscal 2018\nDolby is providing the following estimates for its third quarter (Q3) of fiscal 2018:\nTotal revenue will range from $310 million to $320 million Gross margin percentages will be between 88.5 percent and 89.5 percent on a GAAP basis and between 89.5 percent and 90.5 percent on a non-GAAP basis Operating expenses will be between $190 million and $194 million on a GAAP basis and between $172 million and $176 million on a non-GAAP basis Diluted earnings per share will be between $0.64 and $0.70 on a GAAP basis and between $0.78 and $0.84 on a non-GAAP basis Effective tax rate will be between 20 percent and 23 percent on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis\nFiscal Year 2018\nDolby is providing the following estimates for its fiscal 2018:\nTotal revenue will range from $1.165 billion to $1.185 billion Gross margin percentages will be between 87.5 percent and 88.5 percent on a GAAP basis and between 88.5 percent and 89.5 percent on a non-GAAP basis Operating expenses will range from $744 million to $749 million on a GAAP basis and from $670 million to $675 million on a non-GAAP basis The ongoing tax rate for the remainder of fiscal 2018 will be between 20 percent to 23 percent on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis\nConference Call Information\nMembers of Dolby management will lead a conference call open to all interested parties to discuss Q2 fiscal 2018 financial results for Dolby Laboratories at 2:00 p.m. PT (5:00 p.m. ET) on Tuesday, April 24, 2018.

An archived version of the teleconference will also be available on the Dolby Laboratories website, http://investor.dolby.com/events.cfm .\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nTo supplement Dolby's financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, Dolby provides certain non-GAAP financial measures to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate Dolby's operating results in a manner that focuses on what Dolby's management believes to be its ongoing business operations. Specifically, we exclude the following as adjustments from one or more of our non-GAAP financial measures:\nStock-based compensation expense : Stock-based compensation, unlike cash-based compensation, utilizes subjective and complex assumptions in the methodologies used to value the various stock-based award types that we grant. These assumptions may differ from those used by other companies. To facilitate more meaningful comparisons between our underlying operating results and those of other companies, we exclude stock-based compensation expense.\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles : We amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions. These intangible assets consist of patents and technology, customer relationships, and other intangibles. We record amortization charges relating to these intangible assets in our GAAP financial statements, and we view these charges as items arising from pre-acquisition activities that are determined by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. As these amortization charges do not directly correlate to our operations during any particular period, and often remain unchanged between reporting periods, we exclude these charges to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating results and comparisons to our past operating performance.\nRestructuring charges : Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and primarily relate to employee severance benefits and asset impairments. We exclude restructuring costs, including any adjustments to charges recorded in prior periods, as we believe that these costs are not representative of our normal operating activities and therefore, excluding these amounts enables a more effective comparison to our past operating performance.\nIncome tax adjustments : We believe that excluding the income tax effect of the aforementioned non-GAAP adjustments provides a more accurate view of our underlying operating results to management and investors.\nImpact from U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform): The enactment of Tax Reform requires estimates based on Dolby's current understanding of the new tax laws. These charges are the result of a discrete and infrequent event that are not representative of current operating results and therefore, excluding these amounts enables a more effective comparison to our past operating performance.\nUsing the aforementioned adjustments, Dolby provides various non-GAAP financial measures including, but not limited to: non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating margin, and non-GAAP effective tax rate. Dolby's management believes it is useful for itself and investors to review both GAAP and non-GAAP measures to assess the performance of Dolby's business. Dolby's management does not itself, nor does it suggest that investors should, consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Whenever Dolby uses non-GAAP financial measures, it provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely applicable GAAP financial measures. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as detailed above. Investors are also encouraged to review Dolby's GAAP financial statements as reported in its US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is provided at the end of this press release and on the Dolby Laboratories investor relations website, http://investor.dolby.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements in this press release, including, but not limited to, statements relating to Dolby's expected financial results for Q3 fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2018, our ability to advance our long-term objectives and future dividend payments are \"forward-looking statements\" that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations, and as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those projected. The following important factors, without limitation, could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements: risks associated with trends in the markets in which Dolby operates, including the Broadcast, PC, Consumer Electronics, Mobile, Cinema, and Other Markets; the loss of, or reduction in sales by, a key customer or licensee; pricing pressures; risks associated with the rate at which OEMs include optical disc playback in Windows ® devices and the rate of consumer adoption of Windows operating systems; risks that a shift from disc-based media to online media content could result in fewer devices with Dolby ® technologies; risks associated with the effects of macroeconomic conditions, including trends in consumer spending; risks relating to the expiration of patents; the timing of Dolby's receipt of royalty reports and payments from its licensees, including back payments; the impact of Tax Reform; the impact of changes in revenue recognition standards; timing of revenue recognition under licensing agreements and other contractual arrangements; Dolby's ability to develop, maintain, and strengthen relationships with industry participants; Dolby's ability to develop and deliver innovative technologies in response to new and growing markets; competitive risks; risks associated with conducting business in China and other countries that have historically limited recognition and enforcement of intellectual property and contractual rights; risks associated with the health of the motion picture industry generally; Dolby's ability to increase its revenue streams and to expand its business generally, and to expand its business beyond audio technologies to other technologies; risks associated with acquiring and successfully integrating businesses or technologies; and other risks detailed in Dolby's SEC filings and reports, including the risks identified under the section captioned \"Risk Factors\" in its most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q.
