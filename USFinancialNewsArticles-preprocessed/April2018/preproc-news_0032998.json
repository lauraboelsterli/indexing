    "text": "CLARKSTON, Mich., April 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clarkston Financial Corporation (“Corporation”) (OTCBB:CKFC) ( News ), the holding company for Clarkston State Bank (“Bank”), today reported net income of $484,000 or $0.15 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to net income of $369,000 or $0.11 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nJ. Grant Smith, CEO, said, \"2018 is off to a very good start for the Corporation. We continue to see excellent lending opportunities within our market and we are working diligently to procure new deposit relationships. The Bank’s asset quality continues to be very good, far exceeding our peers. Moreover, we are continuing with our efforts to lower our concentration in investor real estate, improving our regulatory capital and maintaining good expense control. We expect more of the same execution throughout the year as we have a good pipeline of business with both conventional and SBA loans. Thus far we are on track with our financial plan and we expect our performance results to be very good going forward.”\nOperating Results\nThe Corporation’s net interest income increased slightly to $1,759,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $1,666,000 for the same period ended March 31, 2017. This represents an increase of $93,000 or 5.58% quarter over quarter. This increase is primarily due to the growth in our loan portfolio. The net interest margin of the Bank has improved slightly from year end December 31, 2017 when it was 3.85% ending the first quarter, March 31, 2018 at 3.90%. Management is actively working to improve interest rates on its loan portfolio with new business as well as loan renewals. We are beginning to see a positive impact on our net interest margin as a result of those efforts.\nNoninterest income decreased during the first quarter of 2018 when compared to the first quarter 2017. The Corporation posted $138,000 for the quarter compared to $170,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of $32,000 or 18.82%. The decrease is mostly attributable to gains realized in 2017 on the sale of SBA loans. However, management does have a good pipeline of SBA loans that are expected to close in the second and third quarter of 2018. Noninterest expense slightly increased, ending the first quarter at $1,286,000 compared to $1,232,000 for the same period ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $54,000 or 4.38%.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets at March 31, 2018, were $201,575,000 compared to $185,894,000 at March 31, 2017, an increase of $15,681,000 or 8.44%. The increase in mainly due to an increase in loans and deposits.\nGross loans increased $14,749,000 from $162,334,000 at March 31, 2017, to $177,083,000 at March 31, 2018, an increase of 9.09%. Total deposits increased $15,621,000 or 9.49%, ending at $180,224,000 for March 31, 2018, up from $164,603,000 for March 31, 2017. Total stockholders’ equity increased slightly from $15,597,000 at March 31, 2017 to $15,823,000 at March 31, 2018, an increase of $226,000 or 1.45%.\nAsset Quality\nThere were no non-performing loans at March 31, 2018. There remains one non-performing asset at $721,000 as of the first quarter for 2018. The non-performing asset is under contract to be sold in 2018. The allowance for loan loss slightly increased to 1.16% of total loans as of March 31, 2018 compared to 1.12% for the same period 2017. Management continually monitors the allowance for loan loss to determine its adequacy.\nClarkston State Bank opened in January 1999 and operates two branches in Clarkston and Waterford, Michigan.\nSafe Harbor.
