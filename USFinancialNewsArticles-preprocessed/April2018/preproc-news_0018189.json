    "text": "JAKARTA, April 10 (Reuters) - Indonesian airline Lion Air Group on Tuesday announced the purchase of 50 Boeing 737 MAX 10 jets worth $6.24 billion at list prices, the company said in a statement.\nIt had placed a provisional order for the jets, the newest and largest member of the Boeing narrow-body family, last June.\nBoeing said it had been listing the buyer for the deal as an unidentified customer in its order book before Lion Air’s announcement.\nRusdi Kirana, co-founder of Lion Air, said the government’s infrastructure expansion, which included airports, helped expanded Lion’s demand for more aircraft.
