    "text": "Boston, Gordon Brothers, the global advisory, restructuring and investment firm, announced today that Chris Carmosino has joined the company as President, Valuations. Carmosino has over 30 years of commercial banking experience and joins the firm from Citizens Business Capital where he led the asset-based lending unit.\n“As a long-time leader in the asset-based lending industry, Chris is uniquely positioned to understand the needs of our clients and evolve the business,” said Ken Frieze, Chief Executive Officer of Gordon Brothers. “I look forward to his leadership, as we continue to grow our valuation practice across our industry-leading platform”.\n“It’s an honor to join such a well-respected firm,” Carmosino stated. “I look forward to working with a first-class team, building on Gordon Brothers’ strong heritage of asset valuation and disposition, and continuing to provide the market leading insight lenders rely on,” he added.\nCarmosino will replace retiring Valuations President, Rick Schmitt, who assumed leadership of the group in 2015 following Gordon Brothers’ acquisition of AccuVal, a leading industrial appraisal company Schmitt founded and led for 30 years. Frieze commented, “Uniting AccuVal’s industrial capabilities with Gordon Brothers’ historical strength in retail and consumer products formed the world’s leading appraisal practice. I thank Rick for his leadership, and wish him the best in his future endeavors.”\nGordon Brothers is the world’s largest appraisal firm serving the asset-based lending industry, with the most ASA-accredited appraisers.
