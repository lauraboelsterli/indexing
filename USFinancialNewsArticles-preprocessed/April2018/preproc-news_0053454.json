(the “Bank”), announced unaudited results for the first quarter of 2018.\nThe Company reported net income of $764,000, or $.58 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to a net income of $603,000, or $.46 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nNet interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $3.1 million, compared to $2.9 million for the same period in 2017. Non-interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $678,000, compared to $668,000 for the same period ended March 31, 2017. Noninterest expense was consistent at $2.7 million for the three months ended both March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017.\nThe Company’s unaudited consolidated total assets increased $2.0 million to $375.6 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $373.6 million at December 31, 2017.

Total stockholders’ equity decreased from $26.3 million at December 31, 2017 to $25.7 million at March 31, 2018.

We have met or exceeded our budget each quarter for the past several years and these first quarter results reflect a positive start to 2018.
