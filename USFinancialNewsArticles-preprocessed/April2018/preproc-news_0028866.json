    "text": "SINGAPORE, April 16 (Reuters) - Singapore began seeking public feedback on proposals to allow short-term rentals of private homes such as those on Airbnb.\nThe government is seeking feedback on issues such as what homes should qualify and the responsibilities of short-term accommodation platforms, the Urban Redevelopment Authority said on Monday.\nThe proposed rules require that a significant majority of owners in a condominium agree to the presence of short-term rentals in their development. The agency also proposed an annual rental cap of 90 days that a property can be used for short-term rentals.\nEarlier this month, a Singapore court fined two Airbnb hosts a total of S$60,000 ($45,800) each for unauthorised short-term letting.
