REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon/File Photo CCB, the first of China’s big four state-owned lenders to report first-quarter earnings, saw its profit reach 73.82 billion yuan ($11.67 billion) in the three months through March, up from 70 billion yuan a year earlier.\nThe result was under the average estimate of a 6.4 percent rise from three analysts polled by Reuters.\nCCB’s non-performing loan (NPL) ratio remained flat at 1.49 percent at the end of March from the end of the previous quarter.\nThe volume of NPLs increased by 4.06 billion yuan over the three-month period to 196.4 billion yuan from 192.3 billion yuan at the end of December.\nThe bank’s net interest margin - the difference between interest paid and earned - was 2.35 percent at the end of March, up from 2.21 percent at the end of December.\n($1 = 6.3230 Chinese yuan/renminbi)\nReporting by Engen Tham in Shanghai and Shu Zhang in Beijing; Editing by Dale Hudson\n ",
