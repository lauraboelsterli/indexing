    "text": "Director of Global Operations John Barrier takes on new role to help continue to advance international programs, both domestically and abroad\nANAHEIM, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Fairmont Private Schools Vice President of Global Operations, John Barrier, was recently named to his new role in the company as a result of his exceptional work in developing education abroad. Barrier has been a member of the Fairmont team since the fall 2001 and is excited to continue to build upon the established accomplishments that he has been able to be a part of thus far. In his new position, he will help to ensure that Fairmont maintains the quality and growth in schools overseas while also staying more connected with its domestic campuses.\nBarrier first began working to provide international students educational opportunities at Fairmont campuses in the U.S. in 2005 and played an integral role in helping the Fairmont International Schools programs begin operations in Asia in 2009. Fairmont now has 11 partner schools in Asia and more than 1,000 students in its programs. He said the growth of the programs would not be possible without the tremendous staff members who work alongside him both abroad and in the U.S., and he is proud that they work together to integrate the strong emphasis of education in the Asian culture with that of the American focus on students’ abilities to apply what they have learned.\n“For us to be able to take the best of what we do here in the United States and combine that with what they do really well in China — to be able to combine that critical thought with the strength of the education program — really makes for well-rounded students and great opportunities for those students,” Barrier said.\nThese opportunities include students attending top U.S. colleges and universities and finding success in academics and beyond. Barrier said that Fairmont has focused more on making differences in the lives of students rather than on the return on investment, which has allowed the international programs to further develop and more students to create their own success stories within the programs.\n“It’s been exciting for me because it allows students to be in a rigorous academic program that focuses not only on the fields of study that they need but also doing it in such a way that prepares them for school here in the U.S.,” he said. “They’re acquiring those critical thinking skills, the ability to think creatively, and the ability to work collaboratively with their fellow students — it’s great synergy being provided to the students.”\nThe goal of Fairmont International Schools is to foster innovation, create solutions, and forge meaningful connections so that individuals are nurtured with the confidence to embrace new ways of learning. All Fairmont Private Schools domestic campuses and international programs are accredited by AdvancED, a nonprofit organization of educational professionals that works with academic institutions to ensure all learners realize their full potentials.\nAbout Fairmont Private Schools\nWith four campuses in Orange County, Fairmont Private Schools is the oldest and largest family of nonsectarian private schools in Southern California. From preschool through high school, Fairmont prepares students to succeed in college and challenges them to become exemplary citizens of a global society.
