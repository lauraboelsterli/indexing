Denton will join EPIC as of May 1, 2018.\nDenton brings to EPIC more than 30 years of risk management, insurance brokerage strategic operations, mergers & acquisitions, business development, and executive leadership experience.\nAs President of EPIC Holdings, Inc., Denton will partner with John Hahn, Pete Garvey, EPIC's Regional Presidents and other senior leaders across the country to drive growth, diversification, and differentiation in EPIC's core retail brokerage business as well as the firm's Specialty Programs and Products groups.\nRegarding EPIC's retail insurance brokerage and consulting business transacted by EPIC Insurance Brokers & Consultants under the leadership of CEO Pete Garvey, Denton will support the execution of EPIC's strategy to become one of the country's largest, most respected insurance brokers and consultants.\nDenton will also focus on assessing existing operations inside EPIC to determine specialty capabilities that should be expanded across the platform. He will also identify further opportunities to invest in both industry and product specialty groups across the country.\n\"Steve has challenged conventional wisdom in our business his entire career and more often than not, he's been right,\" said John Hahn, CEO of EPIC Holdings. \"He is exactly the kind of free thinking strategist and strong leader we value.

I am excited to have this opportunity to build on what we have in common and to help realize the EPIC vision of excellence, celebration, success and fun, as we continue to grow across the country.\"\nPrior to joining EPIC, Denton was CEO of national broker Beecher Carlson (a Brown & Brown subsidiary acquired in 2013). Earlier in his career he held a range of leadership positions across the country with brokers Marsh & McLennan Company and Aon Risk Services.\nDenton attended the University of Georgia where he earned a Bachelor's Degree in Risk Management.
