    "text": "Buddy Hield scored 19 points and his only two in the second half were key ones as the Sacramento Kings edged the host Los Angeles Lakers 84-83 on Sunday night at Staples Center.\nBogdan Bogdanovic added 15 points on 6-of-7 shooting for the Kings, who halted a four-game slide. De’Aaron Fox had 14 points and six assists and Willie Cauley-Stein contributed 11 points and seven rebounds for Sacramento.\nJulius Randle scored 19 points for the Lakers, who fell for the seventh time in their past nine contests. Kentavious Caldwell-Pope added 16 points and Kyle Kuzma tallied 13.\nHield’s fast-break dunk with 37 seconds left provided the Kings with an 82-80 lead. After a Los Angeles turnover, Fox worked down the clock and hit a shot that bounced three times on the rim before dropping in with 9.7 seconds remaining.\nBrook Lopez drained a 3-pointer to move Los Angeles within one with 1.8 seconds left before the Kings ran out the clock.\nSacramento shot just 38 percent from the field, including 7 of 24 from 3-point range, and hit just 7 of 14 from the free-throw line. The Lakers shot 40 percent from the field — hitting only 7 of 32 from 3-point range — and made 16 of 25 free throws.\nHield recorded four steals and made three 3-point baskets.\nLos Angeles played without point guard Lonzo Ball (knee) and forward Brandon Ingram (concussion). Sacramento forward Skal Labissiere left in the third quarter after spraining his left ankle.\nThe Lakers tallied the final six points of the third quarter to hold a 64-60 lead. Josh Hart’s layup 41 seconds into the final stanza pushed the margin to six.\nFrank Mason III scored the final five points of a 7-0 run as Sacramento inched ahead by one. Los Angeles went back ahead but the Kings tied the score at 74 on Cauley-Stein’s tip-in with 4:57 to play.\nA left-handed dunk by Cauley-Stein gave Sacramento a 77-74 edge with 3:31 left. Randle knocked down four straight free throws to push Los Angeles back ahead before Fox drove down the court and hit a short floater and added a free throw to complete the three-point play and give the Kings an 80-78 lead with 2:22 left.\nRandle split two free throws on his next two trips to the line to tie the score at 80 with 1:08 left.\nHield had 17 first-half points as the teams were knotted at 43 at halftime.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
