Follow us on Twitter at @WSJRisk.\nInternational Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde speaks to reporters in Washington on April 20. AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana Good morning. The International Monetary Fund updated its framework for dealing with governance and corruption issues in its annual economic assessments of countries; the changes will pressure countries to demonstrate improvement in their anti-corruption efforts.\nThe revisions announced earlier this month are the first changes to the framework since it took effect in 1997. They will focus on fiscal governance, financial sector oversight, central bank governance and public contracts, an IMF spokesman told Risk & Compliance Journal on Friday. “We are trying to help governments address those vulnerabilities so they can try to improve the perception and the reality of their governance with their legal and overall business framework,” the spokesman said.\nA review of the 1997 policy conducted last year found the IMF was uneven in its use of the framework during assessments, and “there remained several areas in which the IMF’s engagement on governance and corruption issues can be strengthened,” the organization said in a statement. Member governments requested help from the IMF to help in the fight against corruption; the spokesman said there was “strong support” to look into those issues. “There definitely was a strong mandate to deal with those issues more forcefully, directly and systematically,” he said.\nThe revised framework demonstrates not only the IMF’s commitment to the transnational fight against corruption, but it also puts “real teeth” into the inquiries it will make of governments, said Tom Fox, a compliance attorney, commentator and author of the just-released “Complete Compliance Handbook.”\nIn addition to assessing the laws a country has in place, Mr. Fox said the IMF will look at “pinch points where regulators can put out their hands for payment.” It also specified “private actors” should focus “on measures designed to prevent the private actors from offering bribes or providing services that facilitate concealment of corruption proceeds.”\nThe updated assessment is “far beyond” what the IMF had in place in 1997, said Mr. Fox. “This two-pronged approach is not only far more robust than the 1997 approach but will tie both the supply side and demand side together for a more robust transactional analysis to the problem of bribery and corruption,” he said.\nAnticorruption organization Transparency International called the new framework “a major step forward.” The group said, however, it would closely monitor new IMF country reports to see if they will include basic findings on corruption risks; how the IMF will assess so-called “spillover countries” and whether the IMF will seek help from non-governmental organizations when conducting assessments.\n“If properly implemented, this new framework could mean a significant shift in the IMF’s engagement with anticorruption,” Transparency International said Friday.\nEXCLUSIVE ON RISK AND COMPLIANCE JOURNAL\nU.S. places sanctions on suspected fentanyl distributor. The U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on an alleged Chinese distributor of fentanyl, the company he owns and four people accused of laundering the drug money.\nJian Zhang was charged in October with running a drug network that manufactured and directly shipped thousands of doses of fentanyl to U.S. consumers through the Internet. Mr. Zhang used a Hong Kong-registered company called Zaron Bio-tech to create fentanyl in at least four labs in China, and advertised and sold the drug online since 2013, prosecutors said at the time.\nMr. Zhang’s network directly contributed to American deaths in the opioid crisis, Treasury said Friday . “Combating the flow of fentanyl into the United States is a top priority of this administration,” said Sigal Mandelker, undersecretary of Treasury for terrorism and financial intelligence.\nThe sanctions announced Friday targeted Mr. Zhang, the company and four Chinese nationals Treasury said conducted financial transactions through money-service businesses to launder drug proceeds. Federal prosecutors on Friday announced charges on the same four Chinese people and six Americans. — Samuel Rubenfeld\nUtility’s compliance chief speaks on whistleblowing.

China will give foreign money managers greater access to raise funds from domestic investors.

Oleg Deripaska agreed to sell down his majority stake in EN+ Group PLC, the company that owns 48% of aluminum giant United Co. Rusal .

EN+ said Oleg Deripaska will pare his majority holding to below 50%, but the company didn’t identify a buyer.

A more harmonized and integrated enterprise compliance program, one that includes risk management activities and controls for the supply chain, can help improve compliance efforts. In addition, organizations may want to assess core supply chain management issues that are considered sources of compliance challenges, including transparency in product origin, as well as communication across the organization.\nPlease note: The Wall Street Journal News Department was not involved in the creation of the content above.
