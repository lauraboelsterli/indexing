    "text": "April 21, 2018 / 8:27 AM / Updated 30 minutes ago One killed, 16 injured as Madagascar police disperse protests Lovasoa Rabary 3 Min Read \nANTANANARIVO (Reuters) - One person was killed on Saturday when Madagascar police fired tear gas at opposition demonstrators protesting against new electoral laws they say are designed to lock out their candidate from a presidential election due this year. Riot police walk in formation as they prepare to disperse opposition demonstrators protesting against new electoral laws in Antananarivo, Madagascar April 21, 2018. REUTERS/Clarel Faniry Rasoanaivo \nOlivat Rakoto, director of the Joseph Ravoahangy Andrianavalona hospital in the city, said they had received 17 people with injuries from midday (0900 GMT) to 3 p.m. (1200 GMT). \n“One person came but we could do nothing for him when he arrived,” she said, referring to the dead person, one of the 17. \nRakoto did not comment on the nature of the injuries but some witnesses at the hospital said some were caused by gas canisters. \nPrime Minister Olivier Mahafaly said an investigation would be carried out and action taken against those responsible, adding the government would start talks on the new laws. \n“The dialogue to find the consensus is what will enable us to arrive at durable solutions,” he said on state radio.

REUTERS/Clarel Faniry Rasoanaivo \n“The government is ready for dialogue to find this consensus.” \nSupporters of Marc Ravalomanana, a former leader of the Indian Ocean island nation, say the new electoral laws are designed to prevent him running in the election. The opposition is also contending provisions on campaign financing and access to media in the laws. \nRavalomanana, who was deposed in a 2009 coup, has teamed up with the man who succeeded him, Andy Rajoelina, to oppose the laws pushed by President Hery Rajaonarimampianina. \nHundreds of protesters gathered in the center of the capital early on Saturday to protest against the laws which were enacted by parliament earlier this month, before police fired dozens of teargas canisters at the crowd.

Ravalomanana was convicted by a court when he was in exile after the 2009 coup for a range of offences. \nHe has already said he will run in the election due before the end of this year though the precise date has yet to be set.
