FILE PHOTO: The German share price index, DAX board, is seen at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, March 20, 2018. REUTERS/Staff/File Photo \nThe pan-regional STOXX 600 index was down 0.1 percent by 0742 GMT after a flat open, with most sectors in negative territory. \nThe European tech sector .SX8P was the worst performer, down 0.8 percent as worries over regulation of U.S. tech giants persisted. Futures for the Nasdaq .NQc1 were trading down 0.9 percent after an overnight rebound. \nCyclical stocks such as financials and industrials also weighed. \nBritish advertising group WPP ( WPP.L ) was among the biggest individual fallers, down 3.2 percent after the company said it was conducting an investigation in response to an allegation of personal misconduct against its chief executive, Martin Sorrell, who denied wrongdoing. \nGerman IT-leasing specialist Grenke ( GLJn.DE ) was the best performing stock, up about 5.9 percent after a positive trading update for the first quarter.
