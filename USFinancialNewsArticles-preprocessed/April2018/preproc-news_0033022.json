Increased Financial Results Includes Earnings Per Share of $0.51 for Year Ending 2017\nKiwa Bio-Tech Products Group Corporation ( KWBT ) (“Kiwa Bio-Tech” or the “Company”), a leading manufacturer of biological fertilizers promoting eco-friendly agriculture and smart-soil technology, is pleased to announce the financial and operating results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 that included earnings per share of $0.51.\nFiscal 2017\nRevenues of $17,270,069 up 80% compared to 2016 of $9,620,929.

Although accounting for only 10 percent of arable land throughout the world, China produces food for 20 percent of the world population. Our goal is tied closely to the demand of safe food and green agriculture for the world largest population. In 2017, the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture has issued Circular No. 2017-02 to target zero growth in the use of chemical fertilizers. In February 2017, the Ministry of Agriculture of PRC has carried out measures to replace 20% of chemical fertilizers with organic fertilizers for fruits, teas, and vegetables by 2020, which created a 30-billion-dollar market for eco-friendly fertilizer products. In 2017, the PRC State Council issued statements to promote agricultural structural reform on accelerating the cultivation in the agricultural development. The company expanded its business operations to include soil restoration for farmland in China. The Kiwa smart-soil technology is already being supported by the government in China.\n\"We are pleased to report solid results for the fiscal year in which we achieved or surpassed all of our 2017 financial outlook metrics. Our results continue to validate the strength of our market positions. Over the past year, our brand continues to gain market share in China. As we enter 2018, our management team anticipates strong organic growth with gross revenues,” stated Yvonne Wang, Kiwa’s CEO.\nKIWA BIO-TECH PRODUCTS GROUP CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS December 31,\n2017 December 31,\n2016 ASSETS Current assets Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,083,539 $ 13,469 Accounts receivable 28,620 1,122,754 Prepaid expenses 2,474,272 1,417,554 Rent deposits and other receivables 44,423 38,897 Advance to suppliers 12,660,793 1,880,044 Due from related parties - non-trade 19,017 - Inventory 2,745,991 - Deferred cost of goods sold 16,726 - Total current assets 19,073,381 4,472,718 Property, plant and equipment – net 90,500 55,319 Rent deposits-non current 72,631 34,519 Due from related party – non-trade - 1,522,434 Deposit for Long-Term Investment 768,074 - Total non-current assets 931,205 1,612,272 Total assets $ 20,004,586 $ 6,084,990 LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY (DEFICIENCY) Current liabilities Accounts payable $ 1,800,614 $ 1,073,094 Advances from customers 543,581 - Due to related parties 320,199 261,259 Convertible notes payable, net of discount of $1,977 at December 31, 2017 273,200 150,250 Derivative liabilities 247,933 - Notes payable 360,000 360,000 Salary payable 291,401 1,154,921 Income Taxes payable 1,142,973 414,970 Interest payable 1,756,275 1,524,988 Other payables and accruals 2,108,873 924,875 Deferred revenue 28,620 - Current liabilities of discontinued operation - 4,464,685 Total current liabilities 8,873,669 10,329,042 Convertible notes payable-non-current, net of discount of $ 384,799 at December 31, 2017 460,082 - Total liabilities 9,333,751 10,329,042 STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY (DEFICIENCY) Preferred stock - $0.001 par value, Authorized 20,000,000 shares.
