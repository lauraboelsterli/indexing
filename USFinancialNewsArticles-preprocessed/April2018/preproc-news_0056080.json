It also pulled out of South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines.\nAustralia-based staff were particularly surprised at the time because of the bank’s perceived strength in that market, several sources at the bank said at the time.\nSince then, Barclays has run its Asian operations, including servicing Australian clients, from Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore.\nTim Throsby, chief executive of Barclays corporate and investment bank, described the new office as an important part of the firm’s growth strategy.\n“We are committed to devoting financial resources and providing solutions to our Australian clients while supporting the growth and improvement of our global franchise,” he added.\nIt was not immediately clear how many staff would be employed at the new office.\nPaul Early joined Barclays in Sydney in 2007 to lead its mining and metals coverage before moving to Hong Kong in 2012.\nRichard Satchwell joined the bank in 2005 in London before moving to Sydney in 2007. He was most recently based in London as part of Barclay’s leveraged finance team. (Reporting by Jennifer Hughes; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)\n ",
