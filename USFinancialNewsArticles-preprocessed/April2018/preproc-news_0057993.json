    "text": "141 COMMENTS WASHINGTON— Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany described the Iranian nuclear deal as a “building block” and part of a “mosaic” needed to contain Tehran, becoming Friday the second major U.S. ally in a week to lobby President Donald Trump inside the White House about the merits of the pact.\nMs. Merkel also sought to reassure Mr. Trump on trade and military spending, saying that Germany would boost military funding and signaling a new openness to the kind of bilateral-trade agreements that the U.S. president has said he favors.\nMr. Trump has repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the Iran deal and signaled an openness to a parallel deal during a visit earlier this week with President Emmanuel Macron of France . On Friday, Mr. Trump spoke about the need to keep Iran from building a nuclear weapon but also stopping its proliferation of missiles and support for terrorism.\n“They will not be doing nuclear weapons,” Mr. Trump said about Iran. “You can bank on it.”\nMr. Trump reserved his tough talk for Iran, as he displayed a new warmth for Ms. Merkel. The pair have had an awkward relationship, including a visit last year when Mr. Trump didn’t shake her hand during a photo op . Ms. Merkel has had a sharp response to Mr. Trump’s “America first” policies, saying that the days when Europe could count on its allies were “over to a certain extent.”\nOn Friday, the two leaders were cordial and insisted they share a bond. Mr. Trump greeted Ms. Merkel outside the West Wing with a handshake and kiss on each cheek, congratulated her in the Oval Office on her recent re-election and described her at a joint news conference as an “extraordinary woman.”\n“She’s doing a fantastic job,” Mr. Trump said. “My predecessors did not do a very good job. But we’ll try and catch you, OK? We’ll try.”\nMs. Merkel smiled at Mr. Trump’s flattery, and returned her own compliments. She noted the “strength of the American president” in pushing for North Korean sanctions, credited Mr. Trump for a narrowing of the U.S.-Germany trade balance while adding that “we still have a long way to go.”\nMs. Merkel sought to reassure Mr. Trump about issues that have provoked his criticism in the past, especially in the area of trade. Ms. Merkel touted Germany’s increased military spending, said bilateral-trade agreements may make sense in an era when the World Trade Organization has struggled to reach global deals and touted efforts to balance trade between the two nations.\n“I can well envision such negotiations with the United States,” she said about a bilateral-trade agreement. “But obviously that has to be reconciled....The president obviously is not satisfied with the trade surplus.”\nAsked if steel and aluminum exports from the European Union would face U.S. tariffs on May 1, Ms. Merkel said, “The decision lies with the president.”\nMr. Trump temporarily exempted the EU and a handful of other economies from the global metals tariffs, hoping to achieve economic and security assurances, but it isn’t clear whether the U.S. administration will extend those exemptions in the coming days.\n“We sometimes may look at issues differently,” Ms. Merkel said. “But generally around on the basis of friendship, on partnership, we are linked by ties in the world of science, in the world of culture.”\n—William Mauldin contributed to this article.\nWrite to Michael C.
