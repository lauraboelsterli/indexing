    "text": "BELLEVUE, Wash., April 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Voip-Pal.com Inc. (“Voip-Pal”, “Company”) (OTCQB:VPLM) is pleased to announce that it has received issue notifications from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for two additional Routing Billing and Rating (RBR) continuation patents.\nOn March 14, 2018, U.S. Application No. 15/730600 received an issue notification indicating that the application is scheduled to issue as U.S. Patent No. 9,935,872 on April 3, 2018.\nOn March 28, 2018, U.S. Application No. 15/788666 received an issue notification indicating that the application is scheduled to issue as U.S. Patent No. 9,948,549 on April 17, 2018.\nThe addition of these patents brings Voip-Pal’s current patent portfolio to a total of nineteen issued and/or allowed patents. The Company also has several other patent applications in various stages of the examination process.\nAdditionally, Voip-Pal’s Board of Directors has issued the following statement regarding the pending decision from the Patent Trial and Appeals Board (PTAB):\n“The VoIP-Pal Board recognizes the fervent interest of the Company’s shareholders as Apple’s motions requesting sanctions against Voip-Pal from the Patent Trial and Appeals Board following VoIP-Pal’s successful defense in the most recent IPR proceedings remain pending. We have reviewed the facts and the law with many experts who have confirmed that the PTAB procedural law and precedents ultimately support the Company’s position. We must all be patient as the legal process inexorably works its way to a conclusion. We believe that Apple’s request for sanctions is entirely without merit as can be seen from the PTAB’s Final Written Decisions and as explained in VoIP-Pal’s refutation of Apple’s motion, all of which are posted on the company website ( https://www.voip-pal.com/recent-filings ).”\nVoIP-Pal CEO, Emil Malak responded to the current circumstances by noting that, “The passage of time is not without consequence and will increase the damages that Voip-Pal will seek to recover. The meter is still running on our patents with the possibility of increased damages owed to the Company as a result of willful infringement.”\nMr. Malak also commented, “These two new patent issuances have made Voip-Pal’s patent portfolio even stronger. We are looking forward to having this pending decision behind us soon so we can focus our legal case against Apple as we continue to seek monetization for our shareholders. We are in a great position to meet our legal and patent obligations.”\nAbout Voip-Pal.com Inc.\nVoip-Pal.Com, Inc. (“Voip-Pal”) is a publicly traded corporation (OTCQB:VPLM) headquartered in Bellevue, Washington. The Company owns a portfolio of patents relating to Voice-over-Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) technology that it is currently looking to monetize.\nAny forecast of future financial performance is a “forward looking statement” under securities laws.
