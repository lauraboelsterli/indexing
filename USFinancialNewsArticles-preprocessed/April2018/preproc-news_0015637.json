    "text": "Mike Fiers tossed six scoreless innings in his Detroit debut and the Tigers completed a three-game road sweep of the Chicago White Sox with a 1-0 victory on Sunday afternoon.\nFiers, who signed a one-year, $6 million free agent contract during the offseason, allowed three hits and a walk while striking out six. A quartet of relievers followed, including Shane Greene, who recorded his second save.\nLeadoff hitter Leonys Martin reached base three times, including the only two hits the Tigers managed during the afternoon, and scored the only run. Miguel Cabrera drove in his fourth run in two games.\nDetroit has been involved in three 1-0 games over the last eight days. It lost to Pittsburgh and Kansas City by the same score.\nReynaldo Lopez (0-1) was the hard-luck loser. He allowed only an unearned run in seven innings while walking five and striking out five. Ex-Tiger Bruce Rondon struck out all four batters he faced in his first outing against his former team. Avisail Garcia had two of the White Sox’s three hits.\nThe Tigers manufactured a run in the first. Martin blooped a single, stole second, advanced on a passed ball and scored on Cabrera’s sacrifice fly.\nChicago squandered a bases-full opportunity with one out in the bottom of the inning. Nicky Delmonico lined out to short and Welington Castillo grounded out to short.\nThe Tigers had two on and two out in the fourth but Lopez escaped that jam by striking out John Hicks.\nDetroit setup man Joe Jimenez struck out two of the three batters he faced in the eighth.\nRondon mowed down Nicholas Castellanos, Niko Goodrum and Mikie Mahtook in the top of the ninth.\nGarcia led off the bottom of the ninth against Greene and reached on an error by third baseman Jeimer Candelario. Greene then induced Jose Abreu to hit into a 6-4-3 double play on a 2-2 pitch. Greene struck out Matt Davidson looking to end the game.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
