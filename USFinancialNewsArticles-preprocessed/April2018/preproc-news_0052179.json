    "text": "TORONTO, Constellation Software Inc. (TSX:CSU) (“Constellation” or the “Company”) today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018 and declared a $1.00 per share dividend payable on July 5, 2018 to all common shareholders of record at close of business on June 15, 2018. This dividend has been designated as an eligible dividend for the purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada). Please note that all dollar amounts referred to in this press release are in U.S. Dollars unless otherwise stated.\nThe following press release should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and the accompanying notes, our Management Discussion and Analysis for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and with our annual Consolidated Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and our annual Management’s Discussion and Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2017, which can be found on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on the Company’s website www.csisoftware.com . Additional information about the Company is also available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nQ1 2018 Headlines:\nRevenue grew 29% (5% organic growth, 0% after adjusting for changes in foreign exchange rates) to $719 million compared to $555 million in Q1 2017. Adjusted EBITA increased $28 million or 21% to $159 million as compared to $131 million in Q1 2017. Net income increased 104% to $83 million ($3.90 on a diluted per share basis) from $40 million ($1.91 on a diluted per share basis) in Q1 2017. Adjusted net income increased 51% to $143 million ($6.73 on a diluted per share basis) from $95 million ($4.46 on a diluted per share basis) in Q1 2017. A number of acquisitions were completed for aggregate cash consideration of $320 million (which includes acquired cash). Deferred payments associated with these acquisitions have an estimated value of $47 million resulting in total consideration of $367 million. Cash flows from operations were $258 million, an increase of 42%, or $76 million, compared to $182 million for the comparable period in 2017.\nTotal revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $719 million, an increase of 29%, or $163 million, compared to $555 million for the comparable period in 2017. The increase is primarily attributable to growth from acquisitions as the Company experienced organic growth of 5% in the quarter, 0% after adjusting for the impact of changes in the valuation of the US dollar against most major currencies in which the Company transacts business. The Company adopted IFRS 15 “Revenue from contracts with customers” (“IFRS 15”) effective January 1, 2018 utilizing the cumulative effect method. Under the cumulative effect method comparative periods have not been restated however the quantitative differences between reported results under IFRS 15 and those that would have been reported under IAS 11 and IAS 18 (“prior IFRS”) have been disclosed. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018 total revenue was $9 million higher than it would have been under prior IFRS. The organic growth figures included above and below exclude the impact of this increase.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Adjusted EBITA increased to $159 million compared to $131 million for the same period in 2017 representing an increase of 21%. Adjusted EBITA margin was 22% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and 24% for the same period in 2017. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018 Adjusted EBITA per share on a diluted basis increased 21% to $7.48, compared to $6.16 for the same period last year. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018 Adjusted EBITA was $9 million higher than it would have been under prior IFRS. Excluding the impact of IFRS 15 Adjusted EBITA margin would have been 21% in Q1 2018. The margin decline is primarily the result of lower margins on recently acquired businesses.\nNet income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $83 million compared to net income of $40 million for the same period in 2017. On a per share basis this translated into a net income per diluted share of $3.90 in the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to net income per diluted share of $1.91 for the same period in 2017.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, Adjusted net income increased to $143 million from $95 million for the same period in 2017, representing an increase of 51%. Adjusted net income margin was 20% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 and 17% for the same period in 2017. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018 Adjusted net income was $5 million higher than it would have been under prior IFRS. Excluding the impact of a $14 million unrealized foreign exchange gain recorded in Q1 2018, an $8 million financial liability accrual reversal recorded to finance and other income in Q1 2018, the $5 million impact of IFRS 15 and a $2 million unrealized foreign exchange loss recorded in Q1 2017 the margins would have been 16% and 17% for Q1 2018 and Q1 2017 respectively.\nCash flows from operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $258 million, an increase of 42%, or $76 million, compared to $182 million for the comparable period in 2017.\nThe following table displays our revenue by reportable segment and the percentage change for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017:\nThree months ended Period-Over-Period Organic March 31, Change Growth 2018 2017 $ % % ($M, except percentages) Public Sector Licenses 29 22 7 31% -5% Professional services 111 89 22 24% 3% Hardware and other 26 25 2 8% -9% Maintenance and other recurring 320 239 81 34% 7% 486 374 111 30% 5% Private Sector Licenses 15 13 2 14% -3% Professional services 31 23 8 35% 4% Hardware and other 6 7 (1) -7% -37% Maintenance and other recurring 180 138 42 31% 9% 233 181 52 29% 5% For purposes of calculating organic growth, estimated pre-acquisition revenue from the relevant companies acquired in 2017 and 2018 was added to actual reported revenue for the three month period ended March 31, 2017.\nPublic Sector\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, total revenue in the public sector reportable segment increased 30%, or $111 million to $486 million, compared to $374 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Organic revenue growth was 5% in Q1 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, and -1% after adjusting for the impact of changes in the valuation of the US dollar against most major currencies in which the Company transacts business. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018 total revenue was $8 million higher than it would have been under prior IFRS. Organic growth excludes the impact of this increase.\nPrivate Sector\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, total revenue in the private sector reportable segment increased 29%, or $52 million to $233 million, compared to $181 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Organic revenue growth was 5% in Q1 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, and 2% after adjusting for the impact of changes in the valuation of the US dollar against most major currencies in which the Company transacts business. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018 total revenue was $0.3 million higher than it would have been under prior IFRS. Organic growth excludes the impact of this increase.\nForward Looking Statements\nCertain statements herein may be “forward looking” statements that involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Constellation or the industry to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements. Forward looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, should not be read as guarantees of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of whether or not such results will be achieved. A number of factors could cause actual results to vary significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements. These forward looking statements reflect current assumptions and expectations regarding future events and operating performance and are made as of the date hereof and Constellation assumes no obligation, except as required by law, to update any forward looking statements to reflect new events or circumstances.\nNon-IFRS Measures\nThe term ‘‘Adjusted EBITA’’ refers to net income before adjusting for finance and other income, bargain purchase gain, finance costs, income taxes, share in net income or loss of equity investees, impairment of non-financial assets, amortization, TSS membership liability revaluation charge, and foreign exchange gain or loss. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITA is useful supplemental information as it provides an indication of the results generated by the Company’s main business activities prior to taking into consideration how those activities are financed and taxed and also prior to taking into consideration intangible asset amortization and the other items listed above. ‘‘Adjusted EBITA margin’’ refers to the percentage that Adjusted EBITA for any period represents as a portion of total revenue for that period.\n‘‘Adjusted net income’’ means net income adjusted for non-cash expenses (income) such as amortization of intangible assets, deferred income taxes, the TSS membership liability revaluation charge, and certain other expenses (income), and excludes the portion of the Adjusted net income of Total Specific Solutions (TSS) B.V. (“TSS”) attributable to the minority owners of TSS. The Company believes that Adjusted net income is useful supplemental information as it provides an indication of the results generated by the Company’s main business activities prior to taking into consideration amortization of intangible assets, deferred income taxes, the TSS membership liability revaluation charge, and certain other non-cash expenses (income) incurred or recognized by the Company from time to time, and adjusts for the portion of TSS’ Adjusted net income not attributable to shareholders of Constellation. ‘‘Adjusted net income margin’’ refers to the percentage that Adjusted net income for any period represents as a portion of total revenue for that period.\nAdjusted EBITA and Adjusted net income are not recognized measures under IFRS and, accordingly, readers are cautioned that Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted net income should not be construed as alternatives to net income determined in accordance with IFRS. The Company’s method of calculating Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted net income may differ from other issuers and, accordingly, Adjusted EBITA and Adjusted net income may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Adjusted EBITA includes 100% of the Adjusted EBITA of TSS.\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITA to net income:\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 ($M, except percentages) Total revenue\n718 555 Net income\n83 40 Adjusted for:\nIncome tax expense (recovery)\n19 18 Foreign exchange (gain) loss\n(14) 1 TSS membership liability revaluation charge 7 13 Share in net (income) loss of equity investees (0) (0) Finance and other income\n(9) (0) Bargain purchase gain\n(0) - Finance costs\n5 5 Amortization of intangible assets\n69 52 Adjusted EBITA 159 131 Adjusted EBITA margin 22% 24% Certain totals and percentages may not reconcile due to rounding The following table reconciles Adjusted net income to net income:\nThree months ended March 31, 2018 2017 ($M, except percentages) Total revenue 718 555 Net income 83 40 Adjusted for: Amortization of intangible assets 69 52 TSS membership liability revaluation charge 7 13 Bargain purchase gain (0) - Less non-controlling interest in the Adjusted net income of TSS (7) (5) Deferred income tax expense (recovery) (8) (6) Adjusted net income 143 95 Adjusted net income margin 20% 17% Certain totals and percentages may not reconcile due to rounding About Constellation Software Inc.\nConstellation's common shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol \"CSU\".
