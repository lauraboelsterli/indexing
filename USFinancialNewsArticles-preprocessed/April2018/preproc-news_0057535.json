Unsecured Installment loan revenues rose 21.5% and Secured Installment revenues rose 13.5% because of loan growth. Single-Pay revenues were flat year-over year. The effect of Single-Pay receivables growth was offset by regulatory changes in Ontario, Canada. Open-End revenues rose 52.0% on organic growth in the U.S. and the introduction of Open-End products in Virginia and Canada. Ancillary revenues increased 12.7% versus the same quarter a year ago primarily due to non-lending revenue in Canada.\nThe following table presents revenue composition, including CSO fees, of the products and services that we currently offer:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Installment 61.0 % 59.2 % Canada Single-Pay 13.1 % 15.2 % U.S. Single-Pay 10.0 % 11.7 % U.K. Single-Pay 1.3 % 1.5 % Open-End 10.4 % 8.0 % Ancillary 4.2 % 4.4 % Total 100.0 % 100.0 % For the three months and 2017, revenue generated through the online channel was 43% and 36%, respectively, of consolidated revenue.\nLoan Volume and Portfolio Performance Analysis\nThe following table summarizes Company Owned gross loans receivable, a GAAP balance sheet measure, and reconciles it to gross combined loans receivable, a non-GAAP measure including loans originated by third-party lenders through CSO programs, which are not included in the consolidated financial statements but from which we earn revenue and for which we provide a guarantee to the lender:\nThree Months Ended (in millions) March 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nJune 30,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\nCompany-owned gross loans receivable $ 389.8 $ 432.8 $ 393.4 $ 350.3 $ 304.8 Gross loans receivable guaranteed by the Company 57.1 78.8 71.2 62.1 57.8 Gross combined loans receivable $ 446.9 $ 511.6 $ 464.6 $ 412.4 $ 362.6 Gross combined loans receivable by product are presented below:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nJune 30,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\nUnsecured Installment $ 171.4 $ 196.3 $ 181.8 $ 156.0 $ 131.4 Secured Installment 79.8 89.2 85.0 76.3 67.5 Single-Pay 87.1 99.4 94.5 91.2 80.3 Open-End 51.5 47.9 32.1 26.8 25.6 CSO 57.1 78.8 71.2 62.1 57.8 Total $ 446.9 $ 511.6 $ 464.6 $ 412.4 $ 362.6 Gross combined loans receivable increased $84.3 million, or 23.3%, to $446.9 million for the three months compared to $362.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 with solid growth in all categories of Company Owned loans. Gross combined loans receivable decreased sequentially from December 31, 2017 because of seasonality as the Company's customers use tax refunds to repay balances.\nUnsecured Installment Loans\nUnsecured Installment revenue and gross combined loans receivable increased from the prior year quarter due to growth in the United States, primarily in California; growth in Canada, primarily in Alberta; and growth in the United Kingdom.

This is explained more fully in the segment analysis that follows.\nCost of Providing Services\nThe total cost of providing services increased $3.5 million, or 5.2%, to $71.5 million in the three months , compared to $67.9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily because of higher customer acquisition spend.\nOperating Expenses\nCorporate, district and other expense increased $7.5 million, or 22.6% primarily due to $4.1 million additional compensation expense from increased marketing, collections and technology headcount and $1.7 million of additional share-based compensation expense.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rate for the three months was 33.0% compared to 36.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (\"2017 Tax Act\"), the corporate income tax rate for the U.S. decreased from 35% to 21%, effective in 2018. The provision for income tax as of March 31, 2018 includes an additional accrual of $1.2 million for adjustments to estimates of the tax on prior years' foreign repatriation and an estimated GILTI (\"Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income\") tax of $0.6 million. The $1.2 million additional provision on prior years' foreign repatriation was the result of additional interpretative guidance from the IRS issued during 2018 while the GILTI provision is a new, continuous requirement under the 2017 Tax Act. These items increased the effective tax rate by 5.2%. Excluding the impact of these items, the effective rate for the three months was 27.8%.\nSegment Analysis\nWe report financial results for three reportable segments: the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. Following is a recap of results of operations for the segment and period indicated:\nU.S. Segment Results Three Months Ended March 31, Change (dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 $ % Revenue $ 204,593 $ 174,322 $ 30,271 17.4 % Provision for losses 64,333 49,194 15,139 30.8 % Net revenue 140,260 125,128 15,132 12.1 % Advertising costs 5,159 4,694 465 9.9 % Non-advertising costs of providing services 43,757 43,301 456 1.1 % Total cost of providing services 48,916 47,995 921 1.9 % Gross margin 91,344 77,133 14,211 18.4 % Corporate, district and other 30,532 25,049 5,483 21.9 % Interest expense 22,297 23,345 (1,048 ) (4.5 )% Loss on extinguishment of debt 11,683 12,458 (775 ) (6.2 )% Total operating expense 64,512 60,852 3,660 6.0 % Segment operating income 26,832 16,281 10,551 64.8 % Interest expense 22,297 23,345 (1,048 ) (4.5 )% Depreciation and amortization 3,407 3,360 47 1.4 % EBITDA 52,536 42,986 9,550 22.2 % Loss on extinguishment of debt 11,683 12,458 (775 ) Other adjustments (59 ) 6 (65 ) Transaction related costs — 2,254 (2,254 ) Share-based cash and non-cash compensation 1,842 126 1,716 Adjusted EBITDA $ 66,002 $ 57,830 $ 8,172 14.1 % U.S. Segment Results - For the three months and 2017\nFirst quarter U.S. revenues grew by $30.3 million or 17.4% to $204.6 million.\nU.S. revenue growth was driven by a $51.3 million, or 18.8%, increase in gross combined loans receivable to $323.8 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $272.5 million in the prior year period. We experienced volume growth primarily from Unsecured Installment receivables, which increased year-over-year $30.3 million, or 21.2%. Secured Installment receivables increased from the prior year period by $11.3 million or 15.9%, and Open-End receivables increased $8.9 million, or 34.8% compared to the prior year period. Open-end growth was driven by year-over-year expansion in Kansas and Tennessee of 12.2% and 8.6%, respectively, and the 2017 launch of Open-End in Virginia.\nThe increase of $15.1 million, or 30.8%, in provision for losses was primarily driven by the increase in combined loans receivable as previously discussed.\nU.S. cost of providing services remained consistent with the same period in the prior year. The total cost of providing services for the three months were $48.9 million, a slight increase of $0.9 million, or 1.9% compared to $48.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nThe $5.5 million increase of corporate, district and other operating expenses includes $3.0 million of additional compensation expense, primarily due to increased marketing, collections and technology headcount and $1.7 million of additional share-based compensation expense.\nCanada Segment Results Three Months Ended March 31, (dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 Change $ Change % Revenue $ 46,250 $ 41,566 $ 4,684 11.3 % Provision for losses 12,550 10,228 2,322 22.7 % Net revenue 33,700 31,338 2,362 7.5 % Advertising costs 2,726 1,781 945 53.1 % Non-advertising costs of providing services 16,472 15,257 1,215 8.0 % Total cost of providing services 19,198 17,038 2,160 12.7 % Gross margin 14,502 14,300 202 1.4 % Corporate, district and other 4,897 3,375 1,522 45.1 % Interest expense 57 29 28 96.6 % Total operating expense 4,954 3,404 1,550 45.5 % Segment operating income\n9,548 10,896 (1,348 ) (12.4 )% Interest expense 57 29 28 96.6 % Depreciation and amortization 1,128 1,119 9 0.8 % EBITDA 10,733 12,044 (1,311 ) (10.9 )% Other adjustments 16 (314 ) 330 Adjusted EBITDA $ 10,749 $ 11,730 $ (981 ) (8.4 )% Canada Segment Results - For the three months and 2017\nRevenue in Canada was impacted by the product transition in Alberta from Single-Pay loans to Unsecured Installment and Open-End loans and the impact of regulatory rate changes in Ontario and British Columbia. Canada revenue improved $4.7 million, or 11.3% to $46.3 million for the three months from $41.6 million in the prior year period. On a constant currency basis, revenue was up $2.6 million, or 6.3%.\nSingle-Pay revenue increased $0.1 million, or 0.3% to $34.3 million for the three months due to 17.9% higher origination volumes compared to the same period in the prior year. Single-Pay ending receivables increased $5.7 million, or 13.1%, to $48.7 million from $43.1 million in the prior year period.\nCanadian non-Single-Pay revenue grew $4.6 million, or 61.9% compared to the same quarter a year ago on $22.0 million, or 68.8% growth in related loan balances.\nThe provision for losses increased $2.3 million or 22.7% to $12.6 million for the three months compared to $10.2 million in the prior year period, primarily due to relative loan volumes and mix shift from Single-Pay loans to Unsecured Installment and Open-End loans. On a constant currency basis, provision for losses increased $1.8 million, or 17.2%.\nThe cost of providing services in Canada increased $2.2 million, or 12.7%, to $19.2 million for the three months , compared to $17.0 million in the prior year period. The increase was due primarily to $0.9 million, or 53.1%, higher advertising costs compared to the prior year period and an increase in occupancy expense from higher store counts. We have opened six LendDirect stores since 2017. On a constant currency basis, cost of providing services increased $1.3 million, or 7.6%.\nOperating expenses increased $1.6 million, or 45.5%, to $5.0 million in the three months , from $3.4 million in the prior year period, due to increased collections and customer support payroll expenses from seasonality, increased volumes, expansion of the LendDirect business, and product shifts from Single-Pay loans to Unsecured Installment and Open-End loans. On a constant currency basis, operating expenses increased $1.3 million, or 39.2%.\nU.K. Segment Results Three Months Ended March 31, (dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 Change $ Change % Revenue $ 10,915 $ 8,692 $ 2,223 25.6 % Provision for losses 4,148 2,314 1,834 79.3 % Net revenue 6,767 6,378 389 6.1 % Advertising costs 1,871 1,213 658 54.2 % Non-advertising costs of providing services 1,497 1,693 (196 ) (11.6 )% Total cost of providing services 3,368 2,906 462 15.9 % Gross margin 3,399 3,472 (73 ) (2.1 )% Corporate, district and other 5,025 4,569 456 10.0 % Interest income (5 ) (8 ) (3 ) (37.5 )% Total operating expense 5,020 4,561 459 10.1 % Segment operating loss\n(1,621 ) (1,089 ) (532 ) 48.9 % Interest income (5 ) (8 ) (3 ) (37.5 )% Depreciation and amortization 126 175 (49 ) (28.0 )% EBITDA (1,500 ) (922 ) (578 ) 62.7 % Other adjustments (36 ) (6 ) (30 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ (1,536 ) $ (928 ) $ (608 ) 65.5 % U.K. Segment Results - For the three months and 2017\nU.K. revenue improved $2.2 million, or 25.6% to $10.9 million for the three months from $8.7 million in the prior year period.

(\"CFTC\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. CFTC redeemed $77.5 million of the 12.00% Senior Secured Notes at a price equal to 112.00% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Following the redemption, $527.5 million of the original outstanding principal amount of the Notes remain outstanding. The redemption was conducted pursuant to the indenture governing the Notes, dated as of February 15, 2017, by and among CFTC, the guarantors party thereto and TMI Trust Company, as trustee and collateral agent. The decrease in cash was offset by the 1.0 million of shares exercised by the underwriters on January 5, 2018 in connection with our initial public offering in December 2017. The exercise of this option provided additional cash proceeds of $13.1 million.\nGross Loans Receivable and Allowance for Loan Losses - As previously explained in the Loan Volume and Portfolio Performance Analysis section, changes in Gross Loans Receivable and related Allowance for Loan Losses were due to seasonality resulting from higher customer demand and loan origination volumes during the fourth quarter of 2017 that were concentrated on Installment loans.\nOther Assets - Other assets increased because of a $1.5 million increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance used to fund our non-qualified deferred compensation plan and an additional $1.0 million investment we made in Cognical Holdings, Inc. in March 2018 that increased the Company's equity ownership from 9.4% to 10.4%. Cognical Holdings, Inc. operates as a business under an online website, www.zibby.com , that facilitates the purchase of household items by underbanked consumers.\nLong-term debt (including current maturities) and Accrued Interest - Changes from year-end 2017 are due to the redemption of the 12.00% Senior Secured Notes as previously discussed. For more information about the Company's long term debt, see Note 11, “Long-Term Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Company's Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 13, 2018.\nAbout CURO\nCURO Group Holdings Corp.

These include statements related to our fiscal 2018 outlook. In addition, words such as “as “guidance,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “forecast,” “step,” “plan,” “predict,” “focused,” “project,” “is likely,” “expect,” “intend,” “should,” “will,” “confident,” variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify . Our ability to achieve these is based on certain assumptions and judgments, including our ability to execute on our business strategy and our ability to accurately predict our future financial results. These assumptions and judgments may prove to be inaccurate in the future. These are not guarantees of future performance and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict with regard to timing, extent, likelihood and degree of occurrence. There are important factors both within and outside of our control that could cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those in the . These factors include our level of indebtedness; our dependence on third-party lenders to provide the cash we need to fund our loans and our ability to affordably access third-party financing; our ability to protect our proprietary technology and analytics and keep up with that of our competitors; disruption of our information technology systems that adversely affect our business operations; ineffective pricing of the credit risk of our prospective or existing customers; inaccurate information supplied by customers or third parties would could lead to errors in judging customers’ qualifications to receive loans; improper disclosure of customer personal data; failure or third parties who provide products, services or support to us; any failure of third-party-lenders upon whom we rely to conduct business in certain states; disruption to our relationships with banks and other third-part electronic payment solutions providers; disruption caused by employee or third-party theft and errors in our stores as well as other factors discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on as a prediction of actual future results. We undertake no obligation to update, amend or clarify any forward-looking statement for any reason.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the financial information prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, we provide certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” including:\nAdjusted Net Income (Net Income minus certain non-cash and other adjusting items) Adjusted Earnings per share (Earnings per share minus the per share impacts of certain non-cash and other adjusting items) EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization); Adjusted EBITDA (EBITDA plus or minus certain non-cash and other adjusting items); and Gross Combined Loans Receivable (includes loans originated by third-party lenders through CSO programs which are not included in the consolidated financial statements).\nWe believe that presentation of non-GAAP financial information is meaningful and useful in understanding the activities and business metrics of the Company's operations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the business that, when viewed with its GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the business.\nWe believe that investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, to assess operating performance and that such measures may highlight trends in the business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying on financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, we believe that the adjustments shown below are useful to investors in order to allow them to compare the Company's financial results during the periods shown without the effect of each of these income or expense items. In addition, we believe that Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of public companies in the Company's industry, many of which present Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share, EBITDA and/or Adjusted EBITDA when reporting their results.\nIn addition to reporting loans receivable information in accordance with GAAP, we provide Gross Combined Loans Receivable consisting of owned loans receivable plus loans originated by third-party lenders through the CSO programs, which we guarantee but do not include in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes this analysis provides investors with important information needed to evaluate overall lending performance.\nWe provide non-GAAP financial information for informational purposes and to enhance understanding of the GAAP consolidated financial statements. Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Gross Combined Loans Receivable should not be considered as alternatives to income from continuing operations, segment operating income, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities or any other liquidity measure derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Rather, these measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, U.S. GAAP results. Readers should consider the information in addition to, but not instead of or superior to, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nDescription and Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company's income or cash flows as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nthey do not include cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; they do not include changes in, or cash requirements for working capital needs; they do not include the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on debt; depreciation and amortization are non-cash expense items reported in the statements of cash flows; and other companies in the Company's industry may calculate these measures differently, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nWe evaluate stores based on revenue per store, provision for losses at each store and store-level EBITDA, with consideration given to the length of time a store has been open and its geographic location. We monitor newer stores for their progress to profitability and their rate of revenue growth.\nWe believe Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Earnings per Share, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used by investors to analyze operating performance and evaluate the Company's ability to incur and service debt and the capacity for making capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors to help assess the Company's estimated enterprise value. The computation of Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this release may differ from the computation of similarly-titled measures provided by other companies.\n(CURO-NWS)\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180426006702/en/\nCURO Group Holdings Corp.\nInvestor Relations:\nRoger Dean, 844-200-0342\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer\nIR@curo.com\nSource: CURO Group Holdings Corp.",
