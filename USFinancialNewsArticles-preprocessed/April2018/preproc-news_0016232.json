    "text": "8 COMMENTS SEOUL—North Korean leader Kim Jong Un publicly acknowledged for the first time the prospect of a “dialogue” with the U.S. and a planned summit meeting with South Korea’s president, breaking a weekslong silence that had raised questions about Pyongyang’s participation in the high-level meetings.\nMr. Kim, speaking at a meeting of the Politburo of the Workers’ Party of Korea on Monday, “made a profound analysis and appraisal of the orientation of the development of the north-south relations at present and the prospect of the DPRK-U.S. dialogue,” according to a state media report published Tuesday in Pyongyang.\nThe DPRK is the acronym for the country’s formal name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\nMr. Kim’s remarks were published just hours after President Donald Trump said at a cabinet meeting Monday that a summit with Mr. Kim could take place “in May, or early June,” extending a timeline that the White House had first made public last month.\nMr. Kim’s acknowledgment of the high-level meetings came after a lengthy silence that had led some experts to wonder about North Korea’s willingness to meet Mr. Trump and South Korean President Moon Jae-in. \nWord of Pyongyang’s apparent agreement on the summits had initially come from South Korean envoys who had met with Mr. Kim, and not directly from North Korea, which for several weeks made no mention of the meetings in its state media.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that Pyongyang had made direct assurances to Washington that the issue of its nuclear arsenal would be up for discussion at a possible U.S.-North Korea summit—fulfilling a key demand of the White House.\n“There will be great respect paid by both parties and hopefully there will be a deal on de-nuking,” Mr. Trump said on Monday. “Hopefully it will be a relationship that will be much different than it has been for many, many years.”\n—Michael Bender in Washington contributed to this article. \nWrite to Jonathan Cheng at jonathan.cheng@wsj.com",
