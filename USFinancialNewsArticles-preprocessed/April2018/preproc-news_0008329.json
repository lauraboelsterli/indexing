    "text": "SANTIAGO, April 4 (Reuters) - Chile’s new government plans to slash $500 million in spending over four years to reduce a larger-than-anticipated fiscal deficit inherited from its predecessor, Finance Minister Felipe Larrain said on Wednesday.\nConservative President Sebastian Pinera took office in early March, calling for a return to “fiscal equilibrium” in order to combat economic “stagnation” in the world’s top copper exporter. {nL1N1QT0FY}\nLarrain said the budget cuts would make good on that promise by sharply reducing the purchase and use of state vehicles, cutting back on state-funded travel and slashing administrative and marketing expenses, among others.\n“We cannot continue {spending} at the current rate,” he said.\nIn total, the cuts will amount to $122 million annually.\nTotal government spending for 2018 is slated for about $70 billion.\nShortly before leaving office, outgoing President Michelle Bachelet’s government reported it had left a fiscal deficit of 2.1 percent of gross domestic product, instead of 1.7 percent as targeted.\nDuring his campaign, Pinera, who also governed from 2010 to 2014, said he hoped to guide the country to fiscal equilibrium within six to eight years.
