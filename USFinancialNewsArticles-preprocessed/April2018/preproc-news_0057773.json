    "text": "First Quarter Highlights\nTotal deposits grew $338 million, or 22.99%, to $1.81 billion year-over-year Loans held for investment grew $536 million, or 46.48%, to $1.69 billion year-over-year Net interest margin widened 67 bps to 5.22% year-over-year Earnings per diluted share increased 33.33% to $0.48 for the first quarter of 2018 Return on average assets improved to 1.70% for the first quarter of 2018 Return on average equity improved to 13.96% for the first quarter of 2018\nAMERICAN FORK, Utah, April 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- People’s Utah Bancorp (the “Company” or “PUB”) (Nasdaq:PUB) reported net income of $9.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with $0.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, and $6.5 million for the first quarter of 2017. Diluted earnings per common share were $0.48 for the first quarter of 2018 compared with $0.03 for the fourth quarter of 2017, and $0.36 for the first quarter of 2017.\nNet income for 2017 was impacted by two large, non-recurring items. The Company re-measured its net deferred income tax assets at the end of December and recorded a one-time additional income tax expense of $4.7 million related to the write-down of deferred income tax assets for tax benefits that the Company does not expect to realize due to the reduction of the federal corporate tax rate. In addition, the Company recorded $4.8 million in non-recurring costs associated with the acquisition of the Utah Banner Bank branches and the merger of Town & Country Bank in 2017.\nThe Company has excluded costs related to the acquisition of the Utah branches of Banner Bank and the merger of Town & Country Bank incurred in both 2017 and 2018; higher income tax expense related to the one-time write-down of its deferred income tax assets recorded in 2017; and the loss on investment securities sold in 2017 to raise liquidity to fund the purchase of net assets from the acquisition of the Utah branches of Banner Bank recorded in the third quarter of 2017 to derive non-GAAP financial information related to the Company’s core operations. The Company believes this non-GAAP (NG) financial information is useful in understanding the Company’s core financial performance.\nNet income from core operations was $9.3 million, or $0.49 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2018 compared with $8.1 million, or $0.43 per diluted common share, for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $6.5 million, or $0.36 per diluted common share, for the first quarter of 2017 (NG) .\nReturn on average assets for the first quarter of 2018 was 1.70% compared with 0.12% for the fourth quarter of 2017, and 1.59% for the first quarter of 2017. Return on average assets from core operations for the first quarter 2018 was 1.75% compared with 1.58% for the fourth quarter of 2017, and 1.59% for the first quarter of 2017 (NG) .\nReturn on average equity for the first quarter of 2018 was 13.96% compared with 0.92% for the fourth quarter of 2017, and 11.39% for the first quarter of 2017. Return on average equity from core operations for the first quarter 2018 was 14.37% compared with 12.59% for the fourth quarter of 2017, and 11.39% for the first quarter of 2017 (NG) .\nThe Board of Directors declared an increased quarterly dividend payment of $0.10 per common share. The dividend will be payable on May 14, 2018 to shareholders of record on May 7, 2018. The dividend payout ratio for earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was 20.74%. This continues the over 50-year trend of paying dividends by the Company.\n“2017 was a transformational year for us as we successfully completed the acquisition, conversion, and integration of both the Utah branch locations from Banner Bank and Town & Country Bank. These two transactions expanded our footprint throughout Utah and southern Idaho,” said Len Williams, President and Chief Executive Officer. “With these two transactions behind us, we believe that we can continue to grow our business organically and diversify our loan portfolio. We are excited about our prospects to expand our commercial and industrial lending to small and medium sized businesses, particularly in the Salt Lake City metro markets.”\nNet Interest Income and Margin\nNet interest income grew 45.97%, or $8.2 million, to $26.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with $17.8 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase is primarily the result of average interest earning assets growing 27.24%, or $432 million, and yields on interest earning assets increasing 77 basis points for the same comparable periods to 5.52% for the first quarter of 2018. Higher yields on interest earning assets was primarily the result of yields on loans increasing 28 basis points to 6.30% for the same comparable periods and the percentage of loans to total interest earning assets increasing to 82.42% for the first quarter of 2018 compared with 71.64% for the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal cost of interest bearing liabilities increased 18 basis points to 0.49% for the first quarter of 2018 compared with 0.31% for the first quarter of 2017, and is primarily the result of a $97.3 million increase in average short-term borrowing at a borrowing rate of 1.73% for the first quarter of 2018. The increase in short-term borrowings of $39.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 is primarily the result of seasonal deposit outflows and approximately $10.3 million in deposit run-off from the acquisition of the Utah branches of Banner Bank and the merger of Town & Country Bank. The cost of interest bearing deposits increased 7 basis points to 0.38% for the first quarter of 2018 compared with the same period a year earlier.\nNet interest margin increased 67 basis points to 5.22% for the first quarter of 2018 compared with the same period a year earlier. Acquisition accounting adjustments, including the accretion of loan discounts, and amortization of certificate of deposits premium, added 24 basis points to the net interest margin in the first quarter of 2018.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nProvision for loan losses was $2.1 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with $0.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in provision for loan losses is due primarily to growth in loans held for investment and a $1.1 million increase in specific reserves on classified loans. The Company incurred net recoveries of $0.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with net charge-offs of $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income was $4.3 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with $4.1 million the same period a year ago. The increase was primarily due to an increase in card processing fees and service charges on deposit accounts, offset by lower mortgage banking income.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense was $16.7 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with $12.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. Noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 included $0.3 million in non-recurring costs associated with the acquisition of the Utah branches of Banner Bank and merger of Town & Country Bank. In addition, noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 increased as a result of $2.5 million of higher salaries and employee benefits primarily from the addition of employees retained from the acquisition of the Utah branches of Banner Bank and the merger of Town & Country Bank, and $0.4 million of higher occupancy, equipment and depreciation costs associated with the net increase of five branches from these transactions.\nThe Company’s efficiency ratio was 55.02% for the first quarter of 2018 compared with 56.81% for the first quarter of 2017. The Company’s efficiency ratio from core operations was 53.86% for the first quarter of 2018 compared with 56.81% for the first quarter of 2017 (NG) .\nIncome Tax Provision\nIncome tax expense was $2.6 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with $2.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 22.1% compared with 29.6% for the same period a year earlier. The lower effective tax rate in 2018 compared with 2017 is the result of the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate to a flat rate of 21%, the reduction of the Utah state corporate tax rate to 4.95% as well as tax benefits related to tax-deductible stock compensation expense.\nLoans and Credit Quality\nLoans held for investment increased $536 million, or 46.48%, to $1.69 billion at March 31, 2018 compared with $1.15 billion at March 31, 2017. Average loans grew $527 million, or 46.38%, to $1.66 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared with $1.14 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase in loans held for investment was both the result of organic growth as well as loans purchased with the acquisition of the Utah branches of Banner Bank and the merger of Town & Country Bank.\nNon-performing assets increased to $7.4 million at March 31, 2018 compared with $5.9 million at March 31, 2017. Non-performing assets to total assets were 0.34% at March 31, 2018 compared with 0.35% at March 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses to loans held for investment was 1.23% at March 31, 2018 compared with 1.44% at March 31, 2017. In accordance with acquisition accounting, loans acquired from the Utah branches of Banner Bank and Town & Country Bank were recorded at their estimated fair value, which resulted in a net discount to the loans’ contractual amounts, a portion of which reflects a discount for possible credit losses. Credit discounts are included in the determination of fair value, and as a result, no allowance for loan and lease losses is recorded for acquired loans at the acquisition date. The discount recorded on the acquired loans is not reflected in the allowance for loan losses or related allowance coverage ratios. Remaining discounts on acquired loans was $10.5 million at March 31, 2018.\nDeposits and Liabilities\nTotal deposits increased $338 million, or 22.99%, to $1.81 billion at March 31, 2018 compared with $1.47 billion at March 31, 2017. The increase in total deposits was the result of both organic growth as well as the assumption of deposits from the Utah branches of Banner Bank and Town & Country Bank. Non-interest-bearing deposits were 36.78% of total deposits as of March 31, 2018 compared with 31.52% as of March 31, 2017.\nShareholders’ Equity\nShareholders’ equity increased by $29.6 million to $264 million at March 31, 2018 compared with $234 million at March 31, 2017. The increase resulted primarily from the exchange of Town & Country shares for 466,546 PUB common shares, and from net income earned during the intervening periods, net of cash dividends paid to shareholders.\nConference Call and Webcast\nManagement will conduct a live conference call and webcast for investors, analysts and the public relating to the Company's results for the first quarter of 2018 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern time on Thursday, April 26, 2018.
