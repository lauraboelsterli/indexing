    "text": "LAS VEGAS, April 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Diamond Resorts™, a global leader in the hospitality and vacation ownership industries, has closed on the acquisition of The Modern Honolulu, a boutique hotel in Honolulu, Hawaii.\nRated a Forbes Travel Four-Star hotel, The Modern Honolulu adds to Diamond Resorts' collection of premier resorts, and is the company's first managed property on Oahu. The Modern Honolulu is typified by a modern Hawaiian vibe, ocean and marina views, multiple food and beverage offerings, a full-service spa and two swimming pools. In addition, guests have immediate access to Waikiki Beach, and world-class shopping and dining on famed Kalakaua Avenue and at Ala Moana Center.\nDiamond Resorts intends to make several enhancements to the resort, including opening a world-class sales center providing the company with new owner sales opportunities and a gateway to the Japanese, Asian and Australasian markets. The Modern has also commenced a search to re-launch its chic restaurant with a new operator in the space once occupied by Morimoto. Furthermore, Diamond Resorts intends to commence a repositioning plan to gradually convert guest rooms into larger suites, providing a more robust vacation ownership experience.\n\"We are thrilled to add The Modern Honolulu to Diamond's growing portfolio of resorts,\" said Michael Flaskey, Chief Executive Officer of Diamond Resorts. \"The Modern Honolulu exemplifies our company ethos of providing experiential vacations and flexible product use options.
