    "text": "BEIJING, April 11 (Reuters) - Chinaâ€™s vehicles sales in March rose 4.7 percent from a year earlier to 2.66 million vehicles, an industry body said on Wednesday, strengthening after a steep drop a month earlier.\nThe jump comes after China vehicles sales in February fell 11.1 percent from a year earlier amid faltering growth in the market since the second half of last year.\nThe China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) has predicted a 3 percent market growth this year, in line with 2017 but significantly below the steep 13.7 percent gain in 2016.
