    "text": "RENTON, Wash., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Financial Northwest, Inc. (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:FFNW), the holding company for First Financial Northwest Bank (the “Bank”), today reported net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, of $6.8 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, compared to net income of $2.4 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and $2.3 million, or $0.22 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nNet loans receivable increased to $991.1 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $988.7 million at December 31, 2017, and $838.8 million at March 31, 2017. Internal loan growth in the first quarter was partially offset by a $20.0 million repayment received on a $22.0 million construction/land development loan. The average balance of net loans receivable totaled $985.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $963.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and $825.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nThe Company had a $4.0 million recapture of provision for loan losses in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to a recapture of provision for loan losses of $1.2 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and a provision for loan losses of $200,000 in the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The recapture of provision in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was due primarily to $4.3 million in recoveries received during that quarter of loans previously charged off, while the recapture of provision for loan losses in the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was due primarily to $2.0 million in recoveries during the quarter of loans previously charged off. The provision recaptures were partially offset by increases to the allowance for loan losses related to higher loan balances. The provision for loan losses in the quarter ended March 31, 2017, was primarily due to the increase in net loans receivable during the quarter.\n“As a result of strategies we employed to encourage certain borrowers to repay us for amounts previously charged off, we are off to a great start to 2018. These amounts were charged off during the downturn in our economy as a result of the financial crisis, and I am pleased that we were able to negotiate repayment of these debts during this time of economic strength in the region,” stated Joseph W. Kiley III, President and Chief Executive Officer. “In addition, I am very pleased to report that our deposit base grew by $23.7 million during the current quarter, including a $5.3 million increase in checking account deposits. This is an area of extensive focus as we work to transform the Bank from a traditional savings bank to a full service community bank. If you have not visited one of our offices to see the technology we have deployed and meet our team of talented bankers, I encourage you to stop in to enjoy this new bank branch experience for yourself. I am also happy to report that we opened our tenth branch office in a development known as ‘The Junction’ in Bothell. This new branch office is a continuation of our strategy to expand our network, augmenting our efforts to grow our franchise and meet the deposit and lending needs of our communities.”\nThe following tables present an analysis of total deposits by branch office (unaudited):\nMarch 31, 2018 Noninterest-\nbearing\ndemand Interest-\nbearing\ndemand Statement\nsavings Money\nmarket Certificates\nof deposit,\nretail Certificates\nof deposit,\nbrokered Total (Dollars in thousands) King County: Renton $ 31,945 $ 19,620 $ 22,637 $ 228,134 $ 294,434 $ - $ 596,770 The Landing 3,176 980 59 11,571 8,096 - 23,822 Woodinville (1) 1,617 3,431 711 19,744 8,112 - 33,615 Bothell 31 - - - - - 31 Crossroads 1,074 6,388 82 25,104 7,006 - 39,654 Total King County 37,843 30,419 23,489 284,553 317,648 - 693,952 Snohomish County: Mill Creek 1,395 2,314 710 14,814 6,313 - 25,546 Edmonds 1,632 1,305 45 17,619 5,747 - 26,348 Clearview (1) 3,881 3,225 1,080 7,408 1,734 - 17,328 Lake Stevens (1) 1,517 1,359 517 3,131 2,645 - 9,169 Smokey Point (1) 1,867 2,182 547 6,983 3,819 - 15,398 Total Snohomish County 10,292 10,385 2,899 49,955 20,258 - 93,789 Total retail deposits 48,135 40,804 26,388 334,508 337,906 - 787,741 Brokered deposits - - - - - 75,488 75,488 Total deposits $ 48,135 $ 40,804 $ 26,388 $ 334,508 $ 337,906 $ 75,488 $ 863,229 (1) Balance of retail certificates of deposit for acquired branches are net of an aggregate fair value adjustment of $93,000.\nDecember 31, 2017 Noninterest-\nbearing\ndemand Interest-\nbearing\ndemand Statement\nsavings Money\nmarket Certificates\nof deposit,\nretail Certificates\nof deposit,\nbrokered Total (Dollars in thousands) King County: Renton $ 30,005 $ 18,099 $ 25,095 $ 225,714 $ 298,819 $ - $ 597,732 The Landing 2,634 405 44 11,555 7,807 - 22,445 Woodinville (1) 1,904 3,124 685 20,527 7,072 - 33,312 Crossroads 606 5,413 81 13,831 945 - 20,876 Total King County 35,149 27,041 25,905 271,627 314,643 - 674,365 Snohomish County: Mill Creek 1,721 2,931 355 14,325 5,652 - 24,984 Edmonds 1,300 1,119 30 17,576 4,932 - 24,957 Clearview (1) 3,960 3,631 1,247 7,009 1,724 - 17,571 Lake Stevens (1) 1,466 1,266 475 2,829 2,608 - 8,644 Smokey Point (1) 1,838 2,236 444 5,270 3,705 - 13,493 Total Snohomish County 10,285 11,183 2,551 47,009 18,621 - 89,649 Total retail deposits 45,434 38,224 28,456 318,636 333,264 - 764,014 Brokered deposits - - - - - 75,488 75,488 Total deposits $ 45,434 $ 38,224 $ 28,456 $ 318,636 $ 333,264 $ 75,488 $ 839,502 (1) Balance of retail certificates of deposit for acquired branches are net of an aggregate fair value adjustment of $107,000.\nAdditional highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2018:\nNet loans receivable increased to $991.1 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $988.7 million at December 31, 2017, and $838.8 million at March 31, 2017. Deposits increased to $863.2 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $839.5 million at December 31, 2017, and $734.7 million at March 31, 2017. Excluding certificates of deposits, deposit balances increased $19.1 million during the quarter. The Company’s book value per share was $13.80 at March 31, 2018, compared to $13.27 at December 31, 2017, and $12.84 at March 31, 2017. The Bank’s Tier 1 leverage and total capital ratios at March 31, 2018, were 10.4% and 14.4%, respectively, compared to 10.2% and 13.8% at December 31, 2017, and 11.6% and 15.7% at March 31, 2017.\nBased on management’s evaluation of the adequacy of the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses (“ALLL”), there was a $4.0 million recapture of provision for loan losses during the quarter ended March 31, 2018. The following items contributed to the recapture of provision during the quarter:\nThe Bank received a $20.0 million payment on its largest loan that had a balance of $22.0 million at December 31, 2017. The Company received $4.3 million in recoveries during the quarter, primarily relating to balances from two customers, representing payment in full of loan balances previously charged off. The Company’s net loans receivable increased modestly during the quarter to $991.1 million at March 31, 2018, from $988.7 million at December 31, 2017, and was $838.8 million at March 31, 2017. Delinquent loans (loans over 30 days past due) remained low at $225,000 at March 31, 2018, compared to $101,000 at December 31, 2017, and no delinquent loans at March 31, 2017. Nonperforming loans totaled $175,000 at March 31, 2018, compared to $179,000 at December 31, 2017, and $602,000 at March 31, 2017. Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans remained low at 0.02% at both March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, compared to 0.07% at March 31, 2017.\nThe ALLL represented 1.31% of total loans receivable, net of undisbursed funds, at March 31, 2018, compared to 1.28% at December 31, 2017, and 1.31% at March 31, 2017. Nonperforming assets totaled $658,000 at March 31, 2018, compared to $662,000 at December 31, 2017, and $2.9 million at March 31, 2017. The 77.2% reduction in the Company’s nonperforming assets from the prior year was primarily due to sales of other real estate owned (“OREO”) and, to a lesser extent, a reduction in nonperforming loan balances.\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our nonperforming assets (unaudited):\nMar 31, Dec 31, Mar 31, Three\nMonth One\nYear 2018\n2017\n2017\nChange Change (Dollars in thousands) Nonperforming loans: One-to-four family residential $ 125 $ 128 $ 545 $ (3 ) $ (420 ) Consumer 50 51 57 (1 ) (7 ) Total nonperforming loans 175 179 602 (4 ) (427 ) OREO 483 483 2,281 - (1,798 ) Total nonperforming assets (1) $ 658 $ 662 $ 2,883 $ (4 ) $ (2,225 ) Nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets 0.05 % 0.05 % 0.27 % (1) The difference between nonperforming assets reported above, and the totals reported by other industry sources, is due to their inclusion of all Troubled Debt Restructured Loans (\"TDRs\") as nonperforming loans, although 100% of our TDRs were performing in accordance with their restructured terms at March 31, 2018.\nOREO totaled $483,000 at March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, down from $2.3 million at March 31, 2017, due to sales of properties. The Bank continues to actively market its two remaining OREO properties in an effort to minimize holding costs.\nIn circumstances where a customer is experiencing significant financial difficulties, the Company may elect to restructure the loan so the customer can continue to make payments while minimizing the potential loss to the Company. Such restructures must be classified as TDRs.\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our TDRs (unaudited):\nMar 31,\n2018 Dec 31,\n2017 Mar 31,\n2017 Three\nMonth\nChange One\nYear\nChange (Dollars in thousands) Nonperforming TDRs: One-to-four family residential $ – $ – $ 109 $ – $ (109 ) Total nonperforming TDRs – – 109 – (109 ) Performing TDRs: One-to-four family residential 11,904 13,434 21,790 (1,530 ) (9,886 ) Multifamily 1,128 1,134 1,152 (6 ) (24 ) Commercial real estate 3,173 3,194 3,683 (21 ) (510 ) Consumer 43 43 43 (0 ) (0 ) Total performing TDRs 16,248 17,805 26,668 (1,557 ) (10,420 ) Total TDRs $ 16,248 $ 17,805 $ 26,777 $ (1,557 ) $ (10,529 ) Net interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, increased to $11.0 million, compared to $10.4 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and $8.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, due in part to the growth in the average balance of net loans outstanding between periods, partially offset by increased interest expense due to higher deposit balances and increasing short term interest rates.\nTotal interest income increased to $14.1 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $13.3 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and $11.0 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2017. These increases were due in part to the growth in the average balance of net loans receivable to $985.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $963.1 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and $825.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Interest income was also impacted by the recognition of $1.0 million in interest income during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, related to payments discussed above from two borrowers for the interest owed on the balances of previously charged off loans, compared to $436,000 in the quarter ended December 31, 2017. There was no such additional interest income recognized in the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nTotal interest expense increased to $3.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $2.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and $2.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The higher level of interest expense in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was due primarily to increases in the average balances of interest-bearing liabilities, in particular deposits, and increases in short term market interest rates. Advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) totaled $200.0 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $216.0 million at December 31, 2017, and $171.5 million at March 31, 2017. The Bank borrows from the FHLB to supplement its deposit gathering efforts when needed to support asset growth. The average cost of FHLB advances was 1.66% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to 1.46% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and 1.05% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The balance of brokered certificates of deposits was unchanged at $75.5 million at March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2017.\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our total deposits (unaudited):\nMar 31,\n2018 Dec 31,\n2017 Mar 31,\n2017 Three\nMonth\nChange One Year\nChange Deposits: (Dollars in thousands) Noninterest-bearing $ 48,135 $ 45,434 $ 36,190 $ 2,701 $ 11,945 Interest-bearing demand 40,804 38,224 21,584 2,580 19,220 Statement savings 26,388 28,456 27,415 (2,068 ) (1,027 ) Money market 334,508 318,636 218,578 15,872 115,930 Certificates of deposit, retail (1) 337,906 333,264 355,452 4,642 (17,546 ) Certificates of deposit, brokered 75,488 75,488 75,488 - - Total deposits $ 863,229 $ 839,502 $ 734,707 $ 23,727 $ 128,522 (1) Balance of retail certificates of deposit for acquired branches are net of an aggregate fair value adjustment of $93,000 at March 31, 2018, and $107,000 at December 31, 2017.\nOur net interest margin was 3.88% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to 3.65% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and 3.64% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, from the prior quarter, was the result of payments received on amounts previously charged off. The Company recorded $1.0 million in additional interest related to these recoveries in the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $436,000 in the quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nNoninterest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, totaled $646,000, compared to $211,000 in the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and $535,000 in the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The amount recorded in the quarter ended December 31, 2017, was impacted by the $670,000 loss on sale of investments due to our investment portfolio restructuring at year end, undertaken primarily to reduce interest rate risk and to take advantage of the higher income tax rates for 2017 compared to 2018 following the passage of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”). Specifically, the Company sold approximately $37 million in fixed rate securities, with the proceeds reinvested primarily into adjustable rate securities.\nNoninterest expense for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, declined slightly to $7.0 million, from $7.1 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and increased from $6.1 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The increase from the prior year period was due primarily to growth in the Bank’s number of locations in the past year, including the opening of a new office in the Crossroads neighborhood of Bellevue in June 2017, and the acquisition of four branch offices in August 2017.\nThe Company’s federal income tax provision was $1.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $2.3 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and $785,000 in the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The quarter ended December 31, 2017, included a charge of $807,000 relating to changes in the Company’s deferred tax asset valuation following passage of the Tax Act.\nFirst Financial Northwest, Inc. is the parent company of First Financial Northwest Bank; an FDIC insured Washington State-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Renton, Washington, serving the Puget Sound Region through 10 full-service banking offices.
