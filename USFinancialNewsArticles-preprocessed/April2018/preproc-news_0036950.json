    "text": "BARRE, Vt.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- USA Risk Group, a leading independent captive management firm, announced today that David Spratt has joined the firm as Senior Vice President to serve as a subject matter expert to clients and prospects. Spratt comes with a wealth of experience having spent his career in and around the insurance industry in a variety of consultant and Chief Financial Officer roles.\nSpratt’s prior captive insurance experience includes global Chief Financial Officer for Captive Business for Marsh in Bermuda and Vice President Finance for Aon Cayman where he worked with large risk pool entities. As a Principal at the actuarial and risk management consulting firm Dion Durrell & Associates in Toronto, he was responsible for the financial management of insurance reciprocals as well as consulting to clients on alternative risk management. He was also the Chief Financial Officer for Integro Insurance Brokers in Canada. His consulting experience includes many years with Deloitte Consulting in Canada, Australia and the United States – most recently leading the insurance practice within the Strategy and Operations / Finance Group in Toronto. He has also lead the Risk Consulting Practice for IBM in Sydney, Australia with a focus on the insurance industry for smarter claims, analytics and anti-fraud solutions.\nHis knowledge and skills in insurance include all aspects of accounting and finance, strategy development, operations, risk management, business continuity planning, disaster recovery and cyber insurance.\n“David brings our team a breadth of not only captive knowledge, but also industry insight,” said USA Risk Group’s Chief Executive Officer and President, Stephen Roseman. “We view his appointment as a sign of our commitment to being the leading company in the captive management space. Advancing our business model on what matters most to clients is what led us to look for an addition to our team who will fit in with our ethos of innovation and exceptional service, and it is very fortunate that we were able to find someone of David’s caliber to fulfill this role. I’m confident that he will play a key role in going the extra mile with not only our existing clients but prospective ones, too.”\nSpratt will manage many of USA Risk Group’s key captive clients and will oversee the delivery of excellent client service in all of the jurisdictions that the company operates in. This includes developing, managing and implementing a quality assurance and control process for the company as well as creating new captive business opportunities and building a referral network.\n“I’m excited to be starting with USA Risk Group and look forward to working with the team to deliver real value to our clients through excellent client service and innovative approaches to captive and risk management,” Spratt said. “The nature of the risks facing our clients is changing dramatically on a global scale and I believe that captive insurance solutions can play an important role in effectively managing these changing risks.”\nSpratt is a Chartered Accountant, Associate in Risk Management and Certified Risk Management Consultant and is a graduate of Ryerson with a Bachelor’s of Business Management.\nAbout USA Risk Group\nUSA Risk Group (USARG) is the nation's leading independent provider of alternative risk management offering innovative solutions that enable clients to maintain affordable and flexible insurance coverage, improve cash flow, and control expenses.
