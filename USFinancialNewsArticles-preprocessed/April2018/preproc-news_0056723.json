Dhawan comes to Instart from VMware, where he served as general manager of the $1.5B-in-revenue end-user computing business.\nAs CEO, Dhawan will work with Instart’s board and leadership – including co-founder Manav Mital, who will continue to serve as Chief Strategy Officer – to help the company accelerate already rapid growth, deliver world-class service to its global customer base, and lead the expanding market for digital experience management.\n“I believe that no firm is as well positioned as Instart to set the standard for helping global companies deliver an amazing digital experience,” said Dhawan. “The more I learned about Instart, the more I believed in the technology and the company.
