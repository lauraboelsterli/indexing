    "text": "’16 2006 \nCattle learn to be guided by the collar after 24 to 48 hours of training, Agersens says. Using the Global Positioning System to record an animal’s location, the collar relays that information wirelessly to a “base station” connected to the internet. \nIf an animal walks near a virtual fence, the collar emits a sound to keep it away. If it still approaches the fence, an electric shock is delivered. After two or three times, according to Agersens, the animal learns to associate the sound with the shock and will change course. \nBy using the collars, a farmer could in theory more efficiently control where cattle graze, allowing grasses to recover and boosting productivity. Bulls and heifers could be moved together for breeding, while animals could be kept out of environmentally sensitive areas. \nOther startups working on similar products include Vence in California, Halter in New Zealand and Nofence in Norway. One challenge is ensuring the products will be legal. Mr. Reilly said there are regulatory barriers in some Australian states to the collars—such as their use is limited to trial projects—though Agersens is discussing them with authorities. The company isn’t aware of any barriers in the U.S. and Canada, he said. \nIn Norway, where Nofence this year sold the latest version of its goat collar, concerns about animal welfare prompted the Norwegian Food Safety Authority to commission a review of electric devices for livestock. The study, published in December, said collars could be more stressful for livestock—in the learning phase—than electric fences are because animals can see a fence and therefore avoid it. \nNofence says it has “proper scientific documentation that the product has no animal welfare issues,” including research from a Norwegian university professor. The food-safety regulator now considers Nofence to be legal in Norway, according to a spokesperson, who didn’t say what had changed since the December study. At Agersens, Mr. Reilly says two of the 30 employees are animal-welfare scientists. \nStill, some farmers are likely to take a pass. At Redleaf Farm, more than an hour’s drive from Sydney, \nKatrina Sparke \nsaid she is worried about the poor internet connection. An outage, she said, would make her unable to fully control her cattle. \n“Constantly rearranging their boundaries that they can’t physically see would be quite stressful on the animal,” said Ms. Sparke, who looks after 30 cattle as well as other animals. “Happy animals and more-relaxed animals definitely grow better.” \nMatthew Pryor, \nan Australia-based ag-tech entrepreneur who says he isn’t involved in any virtual-fencing business, said the startups need to convince farmers that monitoring individual animals is better than other approaches, including using robots to muster cattle. \n“Even if technically the product works, it’s not beyond imagining that a cow gets its head wedged in a tree” and rips the collar off, he said. “All electronics fail.” \nWrite to Mike Cherney at Close If venture capitalists have their way, tech will soon disrupt how farmers herd cows Some startups are betting that technology can replace fences and become the dominant way to herd livestock \nSEND An error has occurred, please try again later.
