    "text": "April 11, 2018 / 12:39 PM / Updated an hour ago Barclays hires JPMorgan's Tim McNulty as its security chief Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON (Reuters) - Barclays has hired former JPMorgan Chase executive Tim McNulty as its new group chief security officer, the British bank said in an internal memo on Wednesday. \nHe replaces Troels Oerting who left the bank in November. \nMcNulty, who spent 17 years at JPMorgan after working in Hong Kong and Britain’s police forces, will join Barclays in May according to the memo seen by Reuters. \nA spokeswoman for Barclays confirmed the appointment. \nThe hire comes as Barclays steps up its efforts to combat the threat of cyber crime, having launched a new joint operations center at its headquarters in London’s Canary Wharf district. \nThe unit is designed to centralize the bank’s efforts to detect and combat cyber threats. \n(Refiles to clarify memo seen on Wednesday) Reporting By Lawrence White; Editing by Susan Fenton",
