    "text": "SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Washington Federal, Inc. (Nasdaq: WAFD) (the \"Company\"), parent company of Washington Federal, National Association, today announced quarterly earnings of $49,271,000 or $0.57 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $42,070,000 or $0.47 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, a $0.10 or 21% increase in fully diluted earnings per share. Return on equity for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was 9.81% compared to 8.37% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Return on assets for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was 1.26% compared to 1.13% for the same quarter in the prior year.\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer Brent J. Beardall commented, “We are pleased with the continued strength of our core operations; net interest margin for the quarter grew from 3.15% to 3.25% and other key profitability measures improved markedly versus the same quarter last year. We are investing heavily in our employees, our technology and our compliance programs. As a result, expenses have increased and our efficiency ratio now stands at 50.7%. Next quarter we are delivering a new treasury management system to our commercial clients that enables them to process transactions more securely and efficiently than ever before. Our balance sheet strength and the robust western markets we serve provide us with reasons to be optimistic about the future.”\nTotal assets were $15.6 billion as of March 31, 2018 compared to $15.3 billion as of September 30, 2017. Asset growth since September 30, 2017 resulted primarily from a $341 million increase in net loans receivable and a $70 million increase in held-to-maturity securities.\nCustomer deposits increased by $304 million or 2.8% since September 30, 2017 and totaled $11.1 billion as of March 31, 2018. Transaction accounts increased by $102 million or 1.6% during that period, while time deposits increased $202 million or 4.5%. The Company continues to focus on growing transaction accounts to lessen sensitivity to rising interest rates and reduce interest expense. As of March 31, 2018, 58.0% of the Company’s deposits were in transaction accounts. Core deposits, defined as all transaction accounts and time deposits less than $250,000, totaled 93.4% of deposits at March 31, 2018.\nBorrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank (\"FHLB\") totaled $2.3 billion as of March 31, 2018 and $2.2 billion at September 30, 2017. The weighted average rate for FHLB borrowings was 2.62% as of March 31, 2018 and 2.80% at September 30, 2017, the decline being due to the maturity of some long-term FHLB advances.\nLoan originations totaled $819 million for our second fiscal quarter 2018 compared to $944 million of originations in the same quarter one year ago. Partially offsetting loan originations in each of these quarters were loan repayments of $744 million and $711 million, respectively. Commercial loans represented 64% of all loan originations during our second fiscal quarter 2018 and consumer loans accounted for the remaining 36%. The Company views organic loan growth as the highest and best use of its capital and prefers commercial loans due to the fact they generally have floating interest rates and shorter durations. The weighted average interest rate on loans was 4.35% as of March 31, 2018, an increase from 4.28% as of September 30, 2017.\nAsset quality remained strong and the ratio of non-performing assets to total assets improved to 0.45% as of March 31, 2018 compared to 0.53% at March 31, 2017 and 0.46% at September 30, 2017. Since September 30, 2017, real estate owned decreased by $5 million, or 23%, and non-accrual loans increased by $4 million, or 9%. Delinquent loans were 0.40% of total loans at March 31, 2018 compared to 0.65% at March 31, 2017 and 0.40% at September 30, 2017. The allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded commitments totaled $134 million as of March 31, 2018 and was 1.07% of gross loans outstanding, as compared to $131 million or 1.07% of gross loans outstanding at September 30, 2017.\nOn February 23, 2018, the Company paid a regular cash dividend of $0.17 per share, which represented the 140th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. During the quarter, the Company repurchased 1,673,436 shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $34.66 per share and has authorization to repurchase approximately 4,080,149 additional shares. The Company varies the pace of share repurchases depending on several factors, including share price, lending opportunities and capital levels. Since September 30, 2017, tangible common stockholders’ equity per share increased by $0.20 or 1.0% to $19.78 and the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets remained strong at 10.94% as of March 31, 2018.\nNet interest income was $117 million for the quarter, an increase of $9.6 million or 8.9% from the same quarter in the prior year. The increase in net interest income from the prior year was primarily due to both higher balances and yield. Average earning assets increased by $759 million, or 5.5%. Net interest margin increased to 3.25% in the first fiscal quarter of 2018 from 3.15% for the same quarter in the prior year. The margin increase is primarily due to changes in the mix of interest earning assets, higher yields on variable rate loans, cash and investments, as well as a lower rate on FHLB advances due to the maturity of some higher cost long-term advances.\nThe Company recorded a release of loan loss allowance of $950 thousand in the second fiscal quarter of 2018 compared with a release of $1.6 million in the same quarter of 2017 as net recoveries in both quarters were largely offset by strong growth in the loan portfolio. Net recoveries were $1.4 million for the second fiscal quarter of 2018 compared to $5.2 million for the prior year's quarter.\nTotal other income was $12.6 million for the second fiscal quarter of 2018, an increase of $2.5 million from $10.1 million in the same quarter of the prior year. The increase from the prior year was primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in deposit fee income, which was driven by the 2017 launch of the Company's new \"Green Checking\" product. In March 2018, the Company reached a preliminary agreement with the FDIC to terminate its loss share agreements. The preliminary agreement is consistent with the estimates that had been recorded by the Company as of December 31, 2017 and final settlement is expected to occur in the third fiscal quarter of 2018. All future recoveries, gains, losses and expenses related to the previously covered assets will now be recognized entirely by the Company and the FDIC will no longer share in such gains or losses.\nTotal operating expenses were $65.8 million in the second fiscal quarter of 2018, an increase of $8.3 million or 14.5% from the prior year's quarter. Compensation and benefits costs increased by $2.8 million primarily due to headcount increases and cost of living adjustments since last year. Information technology costs increased by $2.1 million and other expenses increased by $3.4 million as both were elevated due to ongoing initiatives to enhance the Company's overall technology platform and its Bank Secrecy Act program. The Company’s efficiency ratio in the second fiscal quarter of 2018 was 50.7% compared to 48.8% for the same period one year ago. The increase in the efficiency ratio is due to the aforementioned elevated expenses. The efficiency ratio was 48.9% for the six months ended March 31, 2018.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted and it provides for significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, such as a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective from January 1, 2018 forward and changes or limitations to certain tax deductions. The Company has a fiscal year end of September 30, so the change to the corporate tax rate results in a blended federal statutory tax rate for its fiscal year 2018. The financial statements for the first fiscal quarter of 2018 were impacted by discrete tax benefits of $3.7 million recognized related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as tax benefits related to stock based compensation. For the six months ended March 31, 2018, the Company recorded federal and state income tax expense of $24.5 million, which equates to a 19.5% effective tax rate. The Company estimates that its annual effective tax rate for its full fiscal 2018 (blended rate year) will be approximately 21-23%. This compares to an effective tax rate of 32.3% for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017. Looking forward, the Company expects the effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 to be approximately 20-22%.\nWashington Federal, a national bank with headquarters in Seattle, Washington, has 237 branches in eight western states.

Washington Federal uses its website to distribute financial and other material information about the Company.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted pre-tax income of $134.0 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 is calculated by adding back the FDIC loss share valuation adjustments of $8.6 million to pre-tax income of $125.4 million.\nAdjusted other income of $27.9 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 is calculated by adding back the FDIC loss share valuation adjustments of $8.6 million to other income of $19.4 million.\nAdjusted efficiency ratio of 48.9% for the six months ended March 31, 2018 is calculated by dividing total operating expense of $127.7 million by adjusted total income of $261.0 million (net interest income of $233.0 million plus adjusted other income of $27.9 million).\nImportant Cautionary Statements\nThe foregoing information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements, notes and other information contained in the Company’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.\nThis press release contains statements about the Company’s future that are not statements of historical fact.
