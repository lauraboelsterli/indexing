    "text": "April 6, 2018 / 2:38 PM / Updated 34 minutes ago George Soros set to trade cryptocurrencies: Bloomberg Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Billionaire investor George Sorosâ€™s hedge fund is planning to trade in cryptocurrencies, according to a Bloomberg report on Friday. Representations of the Ripple, Bitcoin, Etherum and Litecoin virtual currencies are seen on a PC motherboard in this illustration picture, February 14, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration \nSoros had in January called the virtual currency a bubble. \nAdam Fisher, who oversees macro investing at the New York-based Soros Fund Management, got internal approval to trade digital assets in the last few months, though was yet to make a wager, the report here said, citing people familiar with the matter. \nThe hedge fund could not be immediately reached for comment.
