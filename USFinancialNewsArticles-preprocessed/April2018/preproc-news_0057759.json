(NYSE: MMP) has increased the partnership's quarterly cash distribution to 93.75 cents per unit for the period Jan. 1 through March 31, 2018, representing the 64 th distribution increase since its initial public offering in 2001.\nThe first-quarter 2018 distribution is 7% higher than the first-quarter 2017 distribution of 87.25 cents per unit and represents a 2% increase over the fourth-quarter 2017 distribution of 92 cents. Magellan remains committed to its stated goal of increasing annual cash distributions by 8% for 2018.\nThe new distribution, which equates to $3.75 per unit on an annualized basis, will be paid May 15 to unitholders of record at the close of business on May 8.\nThis announcement is intended to be a qualified notice to nominees under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b), with 100% of the partnership's distributions to foreign investors attributable to income that is effectively connected with a United States trade or business.
