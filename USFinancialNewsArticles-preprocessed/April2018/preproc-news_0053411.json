    "text": "19 COMMENTS Your editorial “ Reed College Bows to the Bullies ” (April 20) mischaracterizes a yearslong discussion about revising Reed’s core humanities course. At Reed, we celebrate student interest in the intellectual content of their courses. These changes to our demanding curriculum don’t pick a side in any culture wars but meet our educational goals for the introductory course in the humanities: a single, required course—a requirement now increasingly rare in higher education—that teaches first-year students the skills of critical reading, analysis and respectful discussion, raises fundamental humanistic questions and explores civilizations from multiple perspectives. A significant contemporary rethinking of both the scope and nature of humanistic inquiry will only enhance our understanding of the world we live in.\nProf. Nigel Nicholson\nDean of the Faculty\nReed College\nPortland, Ore.\nPhoto: istock/getty images\nAs Rémi Brague writes, European civilization is unique in having had its source outside itself. It is only the West that has traditionally valued the study of all non-Western ways of life. This doesn’t necessarily make us better, but it gives us an unusual breadth of experience and perspective. Rather than “erasing the histories of people of color,” the West has obsessively preserved historical evidence that otherwise would have been lost to disinterest or worse, like the Bamiyan Buddhas.\nThe old curriculum of Humanities 101 provides the basis for understanding the West’s passionate outreach, which the protesters have absorbed without realizing that they are its direct heirs. Don’t you want to know where you got your attitudes and ideas, guys? Hum 101 isn’t a survey of the world, it’s an explication of the foundation of your world; the world of the curious, intrusive, optimistic, greedy, analytical West. You’re not likely to sit down and read Apulieus later—life gets busy. Read it now. Get your feet under you before you start your journey.\nKerr Wissler Low\nSalt Lake City\nThe issue was identified by my late colleague B.F. Skinner nearly 50 years ago, when he wrote in “Beyond Freedom and Dignity”: “‘Why should I be concerned about the survival of a particular kind of economic system?’ The only honest answer to that kind of question seems to be this: ‘There is no good reason why you should be concerned, but if your culture has not convinced you that there is, so much the worse for your culture.’”\nApparently our culture has not imparted in those students a concern for Western civilization.\nWilliam Vaughan Jr.\nChebeague Island, Maine\nThis is a modern version of “Fahrenheit 451.”\nDavid J. Gross\nSt. Augustine, Fla.",
