REUTERS/Bob Riha Jr./File Photo \nHowever, they have raised expectations for the size of a cut in the amount of cash that banks are required to hold as reserves - the reserve requirement ratio (RRR). \nThe central bank is forecast to cut RRR for all banks by 50 basis points (bps) in the fourth quarter to 16.50 percent, versus the January poll’s prediction for a 25-bps cut in the quarter. \nAnalysts now also expect two additional 25 bps cuts to RRR next year - one in each of the first two quarters - to bring the rate down to 16.00 percent. \nEconomists also predicted annual consumer inflation to be 2.3 percent this year, unchanged from the estimate in January. That rate is likely to hold through 2019, the poll showed. \nAnalysts say the biggest risk to China’s economy at the moment is rising trade frictions with its biggest export market, the United States. \nNinety percent of respondents said that the trade dispute will be damaging to China’s economy. \nWashington and Beijing have announced tit-for-tat tariff plans in recent weeks, but neither has set a hard timeframe for implementation of the measures, offering hope the two sides will be able to reach a compromise. \n(For other stories from the Reuters global long-term economic outlook polls package, see) Reporting by Elias Glenn; Polling by Shaloo Shrivastava, Mumal Rathore in Bangalore and Jing Wang in Shanghai; Editing by Kim Coghill",
