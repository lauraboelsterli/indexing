FILE PHOTO: A Tesla dealership is seen in West Drayton, just outside London, Britain, February 7, 2018. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo \nErika Monterroza, spokesperson for California Occupational Safety and Health Administration, said, “Cal/OSHA currently has an open inspection at Tesla.” \nCal/OSHA’s inspections typically include a review of the employer’s Log 300, Monterroza said. Log 300 is a log of work-related injuries and illnesses. \nThe agency said it will also review to ensure that serious injuries are reported directly to Cal/OSHA within eight hours as required by law. \nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
