    "text": "Published: Apr 25, 2018 1:52 p.m. ET Share\nStocks later sold; spokesman says investment adviser responsible\nBy Ryan Tracy Bloomberg News Joseph Otting bought banks stocks after he was nominated to be the comptroller of the currency and sold them after taking office.\nWASHINGTON—\nComptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting was confirmed for the post in November and sold the stock in January, according to forms he has filed with U.S. agencies including the Office of Government Ethics.\nIn a financial disclosure signed by Mr. Otting on Feb. 20, 2018, he lists the sale of stock in Wells Fargo & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and KeyCorp., among other financial firms. It isn’t clear exactly when he purchased shares in those companies. But financial disclosures dated March 2017 and released after the White House nominated him for the job don’t list stakes in those banks.\nThe most recent disclosure, dated February 2018, is awaiting certification by the Office of Government Ethics. An OCC spokesman also said Mr. Otting uses a professional money manager and “has not made individual decisions regarding specific stocks or securities for several years.”",
