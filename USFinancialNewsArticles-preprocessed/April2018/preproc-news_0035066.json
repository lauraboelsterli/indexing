    "text": "SINGAPORE, April 17 (Reuters) - Singaporeâ€™s non-oil exports unexpectedly fell from a year earlier in March as electronics shipments declined for the fourth consecutive month, official data showed on Tuesday.\nExports fell 2.7 percent in March from a year earlier, data from trade agency International Enterprise Singapore showed, a slower decline than the revised 6.0 contraction the month before.\nThis was worse than the 0.2 percent increase predicted by economists in a Reuters poll.\nElectronics exports fell again in March at 7.1 percent year-on-year, however improving from the 12.7 percent contraction in the month earlier.\nOn a seasonally adjusted month-on-month basis, exports fell 1.8 percent after contracting a revised 2.7 percent in February.\nThe poll predicted a 4.7 percent rise.
