    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s new interior minister Sajid Javid said on Monday his most urgent task was to ensure that the so-called Windrush migrants are treated fairly after a scandal that forced predecessor Amber Rudd to resign.\nRudd quit late on Sunday after she said she had inadvertently misled parliament over the controversy.\nThe government has faced criticism over its treatment of some long-term Caribbean residents who were wrongly labeled illegal immigrants.\n“The most urgent task I have is to help those British citizens, that came from the Caribbean, the so-called Windrush generation, and make sure that they are all treated with the decency and the fairness that they deserve,” Javid told broadcasters.\nReporting by Michael Holden; Writing by Alistair Smout; Editing by William Schomberg\n ",
