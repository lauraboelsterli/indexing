Crossing the border, the vehicle had to drive across a lawn, as there is not a road linking the two sides at that spot.\nFollowing lunch, the two leaders are scheduled to plant a memorial tree before resuming their meeting, and then finishing the evening with dinner and a film.\nJust days before the summit, Kim said North Korea would suspend nuclear and long-range missile tests and dismantle its only known nuclear test site.\nBut there is widespread skepticism about whether Kim is ready to abandon the nuclear arsenal his country has defended and developed for decades as what it says is a necessary deterrent against U.S. invasion.

First across the line\nMoon greeted Kim at the military demarcation line, making Kim the first North Korean leader to set foot in the South since the 1950-53 Korean War.\nIn an unplanned move, Kim invited Moon to step briefly across into North Korea, before the two leaders crossed back into South Korea holding hands.\n\"I was excited to meet at this historic place and it is really moving that you came all the way to the demarcation line to greet me in person,\" Kim said.\nThe two were handed flowers by a South Korean children, residents of a village situated in the demilitarised zone, and met on a red carpet by a South Korean honour guard in historical costumes playing traditional music.

An age of peace, from the starting point of history,\" Kim wrote in Korean in a guest book in the South's Peace House before talks began.\nMinutes before Kim entered Peace House, a North Korean security team conducted a sweep for explosives and listening devices, and sprayed apparent disinfectant in the air, on the chairs, and on the guest book.\nThe United States is hopeful talks will make progress on achieving peace and prosperity, the White House said in a statement as the two men began their summit.\nThe White House also said it looks forward to continuing discussions with South Korea in preparation for the planned meeting of Trump and Kim in the coming weeks.\nJust months ago, Trump and Kim were trading threats and insults as the North made rapid advances in pursuit of nuclear-armed missiles capable of hitting the United States. Unending hostilities\nMoon traveled to the meeting in a large motorcade, stopping briefly to greet dozens of summit supporters waving South Korean flags near the presidential Blue House in Seoul. show chapters 16 Hours Ago | 02:14\nHundreds of demonstrators were seen gathering in downtown Seoul from early morning to protest or support the summit.\nThe two countries expect to release a joint statement late on Friday - possibly called the Panmunjom Declaration - that could address denuclearization and peace, and an improvement in relations, South Korean officials said.\nImpoverished North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because the Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.\nThe United States stations 28,500 troops in South Korea as a legacy of the Cold War conflict, which pitted the South, the United States and United Nations forces against the communist North, backed by China and Russia.\nKim and Trump are expected to meet in late May or June, with Trump saying on Thursday he was considering several possible dates and venues.\nThe latest Korean summit has particular significance not least because of its venue: the Demilitarized Zone, a 160-mile (260-km) long, 2.5-mile (4-km) wide strip of land created in the 1953 armistice to serve as a buffer between the South and North.
