    "text": "ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan said the United States should look at its own actions if it wants the return of an American Christian pastor who has been jailed in Turkey for suspected links to a 2016 failed coup. \nAndrew Brunson, a Christian pastor from North Carolina, U.S. who has been in jail in Turkey since December 2016, is seen in this undated picture taken in Izmir, Turkey. Depo Photos via REUTERS Erdogan made the comment in a live interview with broadcaster NTV. \nAndrew Brunson, who has lived in Turkey for more than two decades, was indicted on charges of helping the group that Ankara holds responsible for the failed coup against Erdogan. He faces up to 35 years in prison. Brunson denies the charges. \nErdogan has previously linked Brunsonâ€™s fate to that of the cleric Fethullah Gulen, the Muslim cleric Turkey blames for the coup attempt. Gulen has lived in the United States since 1999 and denies the charges. Turkey is seeking his extradition from the United States. \nU.S. President Donald Trump and dozens of U.S. senators have urged Erdogan to release Brunson. \nReporting by Ali Kucukgocmen; Writing by David Dolan; Editing by Gareth Jones\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
