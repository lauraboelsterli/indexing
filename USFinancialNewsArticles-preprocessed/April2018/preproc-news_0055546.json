    "text": "By Polina Marinova 9:36 AM EDT MEGA-MONEY\nHappy Friday, Term Sheet readers.\nMONSTER FUND: More details have emerged on Sequoia Capital’s new mega-fund. So far, investors have committed approximately $6 billion to the firm’s third global fund, according to the WSJ . Most of the capital thus far has been raised from new investors, and Sequoia is expected to turn to existing investors next. The WSJ reports that the firm could expect as much as $2 billion for the new fund.\nFrom the WSJ :\nWith Sequoia Global Growth Fund III, the firm aims to buck the hot venture market trend of aggressive management fees set by managers of some megafunds. Rather than charging 2% of the fund’s total capital commitment, Sequoia has told investors the management fee will be 1% based only on the smaller stages of “called capital” drawn from the investors, one of the people said.\nAs we’ve noted before, VC firms are raising larger and larger funds, pumping capital into venture-backed companies at the various stages, and likely inflating already-inflated tech valuations.\nMONSTER FUNDING: VIPKid , a China-based company that links North American tutors with Chinese children, is nearing a deal to raise about $500 million in funding at a valuation of more than $3 billion, according to Bloomberg . This deal could make it the world’s largest online education startup. Tutoring services are becoming a big business in China thanks to a growing middle-class and a job market that values English-language proficiency.\nI first noticed this trend when I spoke with GGV Capital managing partner Hans Tung in December. He told me that he expects more education companies to get funded in 2018. “Consumers have a huge demand for better service yet the quality and the spread of teachers is very uneven in China,” Tung said. “So through distance learning and mobile Internet, that problem will be solved over time.”\nAdvertisement THE LATEST FROM FORTUNE...\n• Ex-HSBC Currency Trader Mark Johnson Sentenced to 2 Years in Prison\n• Silicon Valley’s Schizophrenic Feelings (by Adam Lashinsky )\n• Kanye West Tweets About Starting VC Fund, Meeting With Billionaire Peter Thiel (by Polina Marinova)\n• Why the Jacksonville Jaguars Owner Made an Offer to Buy England’s National Soccer Stadium (by Aric Jenkins)\nVENTURE DEALS\n• Dosh , an Austin, Texas-based cash reward platform, raised $44 million in Series A funding at a $240 million valuation .
