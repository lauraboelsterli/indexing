    "text": "(Adds Quote: s)\nSANTIAGO, April 27 (Reuters) - Chile’s finance minister said on Friday the country’s fiscal picture was worse than previously believed after a $5.567 billion gap in government budgets covering the next four years was found to have been left behind by the previous administration.\n“This is what we have found. This is a worse fiscal situation than we had imagined,” Felipe Larrain told reporters.\n“These are un-financed additional spending commitments that have to be faced,” he said.
