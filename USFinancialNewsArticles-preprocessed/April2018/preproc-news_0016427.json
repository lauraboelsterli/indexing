French President Emmanuel Macron and Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa greet children as they attend a World War One remembrance ceremony of the battle of la Lys at the WW1 Portuguese cemetery in Richebourg, France, April 9, 2018. REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol/Pool \nMore than 7,400 Portuguese soldiers fighting for the allied forces were killed, wounded or taken prisoner by German troops during the Battle of Lys in April 1918. \n“We must not allow ourselves to take for granted the Europe in which we live, as if it were just the result of what we have built together and not of spilled blood,” French President Emmanuel Macron said during the ceremony at the Richebourg cemetery in northern France.
