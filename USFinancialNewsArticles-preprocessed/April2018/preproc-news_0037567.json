    "text": "April 13 (Reuters) - Speculators' net bearish bets on U.S. 10-year Treasury note futures fell earlier this week from a 13-month peak on safe-haven demand due to worries about a trade war and a possible U.S. strike against Syria, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday. The amount of speculators' bearish, or short, positions in 10-year Treasury futures exceeded bullish, or long, positions by 330,635 contracts on April 10, according to the CFTC's latest Commitments of Traders data. A week earlier, speculators held 375,365 net short positions in 10-year T-note futures.
