    "text": "AMSTERDAM, April 16 (Reuters) - Eneco, the Dutch energy company on the verge of being privatised, is looking for a new chief executive to replace Jeroen de Haas who will step down on Sept. 1, its supervisory board said on Monday.\nThe decision to appoint a new CEO was reached “in close consultation” with De Haas, the board said, while declining to clarify the reasons for his departure.\nIn recent months, De Haas, who has led Eneco since 2007, has clashed with a group representing shareholders over the company’s sale process.\nThe 53 cities that currently own Eneco voted by a large majority to sell the company in October, but met resistance from the company’s boards, which preferred a stock market listing or partial sale that would ensure its continuity as a renewables-oriented firm.\nAfter months of feuding, shareholders and Eneco’s management boards finally agreed in February the firm would be sold, paving the way for a privatisation in the coming months.\nDetails of the sale process have not yet been made public.\nCompany spokesman Edwin van de Haar said de Haas’ departure was not expected to have any effect on the sale.\nEneco, estimated to be worth around 4 billion euros ($4.9 billion), is heavily invested in sustainable energy projects and could appeal to energy companies that want to increase exposure to renewable production.\nPotential bidders include Royal Dutch Shell, Total SA, Enel,, Engie, Verbund , Orsted and Fortum.\n$1 = 0.8092 euros Reporting by Bart Meijer; Editing by Mark Potter\n ",
