    "text": "Reported Revenue Up 22% (up 16% in constant currency) Net loss of $19 million reflects $136 million non-cash charge due to change in tax law Adjusted Net Income up 95%\nSAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Levi Strauss & Co. (LS&Co.) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended February 25, 2018, and raised full-year 2018 revenue growth guidance to 6 to 8 percent range in constant currency.\n\"The momentum and growth trends we saw in the back half of last year not only continued but accelerated in the first quarter,\" said Chip Bergh, president and chief executive officer, Levi Strauss & Co. \"Our results clearly demonstrate that our strategies are working and that the incremental investments we are making in marketing, direct-to-consumer expansion and our more diversified portfolio are paying off.\"\nHighlights include:\nThree Months Ended % Increase\n(Decrease)\n($ millions) February 25, 2018 February 26, 2017 As Reported Net revenues $ 1,344 $ 1,102 22 % Net income (loss) attributable to LS&Co. $ (19 ) $ 60 (132 )% Adjusted net income $ 117 $ 60 95 % Adjusted EBIT $ 175 $ 110 59 % Net revenues grew twenty-two percent on a reported basis and sixteen percent excluding $55 million in favorable currency translation effects, driven by broad-based Levi's brand growth in all regions and channels. On a reported basis, direct-to-consumer revenues grew 24 percent on performance and expansion of the retail network, as well as ecommerce growth. The company had 56 more company-operated stores at the end of the first quarter 2018 than it did a year prior. Wholesale reported revenues grew 21 percent primarily reflecting higher revenues from Europe and the Americas.\nNet income declined $79 million due to a $136 million provisional non-cash tax charge as a result of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Excluding this non-cash charge, Adjusted net income was $117 million, nearly double last year's $60 million.\nAdjusted EBIT grew 59 percent reflecting higher gross margins and the revenue growth. Reconciliations of Adjusted net income and Adjusted EBIT are provided at the end of this press release.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nOn a reported basis, gross margin for the first quarter was 54.9 percent of revenues compared with 51.2 percent in the same quarter of fiscal 2017, reflecting the margin benefit from revenue growth in the direct-to-consumer channel and international business, lower product sourcing costs and a favorable transactional impact of currency. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) were $564 million compared with $456 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2017. SG&A as a percent of revenue grew 60 basis-points compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2017 reflecting higher advertising expenses. Operating income of $174 million was up 61 percent for the first quarter compared to the same quarter of fiscal 2017, and operating margin increased to 13 percent, primarily reflecting the revenue growth and higher gross margins, partially offset by higher SG&A.\nRegional Overview\nReported regional net revenues and operating income for the quarter are set forth in the table below:\nNet Revenues Operating Income * Three Months Ended % Increase\n(Decrease)\nThree Months Ended % Increase\n(Decrease)\n($ millions) February 25,\n2018\nFebruary 26,\n2017\nFebruary 25,\n2018\nFebruary 26,\n2017\nAmericas $ 657 $ 578 14 % $ 111 $ 90 23 % Europe $ 453 $ 310 46 % $ 115 $ 65 79 % Asia $ 234 $ 214 9 % $ 41 $ 36 13 % * Note: Regional operating income is equal to regional adjusted EBIT.\nIn the Americas, excluding favorable currency effects of $6 million, net revenues grew 13 percent reflecting higher revenues across wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels in all markets in an improving retail environment, including a particularly strong holiday season in the United States. In Europe, excluding favorable currency effects of $39 million, net revenues grew 30 percent reflecting broad-based growth across all markets, channels, and product categories, with the strongest growth in women's and tops. In Asia, excluding favorable currency effects of $10 million, net revenues grew five percent reflecting direct-to-consumer expansion and performance.\nThe increase in operating income in all three regions reflects higher net revenues and gross margins, partially offset by higher direct-to-consumer and advertising investments.\nCash Flow and Balance Sheet\nAt February 25, 2018, cash and cash equivalents of $590 million were complemented by $745 million available under the company's revolving credit facility, resulting in a total liquidity position of approximately $1.3 billion. Net debt at the end of the first quarter was $497 million.\nFree cash flow for the first three months of 2018 was negative $35 million, a decline of $33 million compared to the first three months of 2017, as a $17 million increase in cash from operations was offset by losses on our hedging contracts, repurchases of common stock in connection with our equity incentive program, and a higher dividend payment. A reconciliation of net debt and free cash flow, non-GAAP financial measures, is provided at the end of this press release.\nInvestor Conference Call\nThe company’s first-quarter 2018 investor conference call will be available through a live audio webcast at https://engage.vevent.com/rt/levistraussao~8997477 on April 10, 2018, at 1 p.m. Pacific / 4 p.m. Eastern or via the following phone numbers: 800-891-4735 in the United States and Canada, or +1-973-200-3066 internationally; I.D.

We have based these forward-looking statements on our current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events. We use words like “believe,” “will,” “so we can,” “when,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project” and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these words. These forward-looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting the best judgment of our senior management and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements. Investors should consider the information contained in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2017 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended February 25, 2018, especially in the “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors” sections. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could have material adverse effects on our future results, performance or achievements. In light of these risks, uncertainties, assumptions and factors, the forward-looking events discussed in this news release and related conference call may not occur. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date stated, or if no date is stated, as of the date of this news release and related conference call. We are not under any obligation and do not intend to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements contained in this news release and related conference call to reflect circumstances existing after the date of this news release and related conference call or to reflect the occurrence of future events even if experience or future events make it clear that any expected results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements will not be realized.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe company reports its financial results in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and the rules of the SEC. However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as Free Cash Flow, Net Debt, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted net income, provide users of the company’s financial information with additional useful information. The tables found below include Free Cash Flow, Net Debt, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted net income and corresponding reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of these items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the company’s actual financial condition and performance. Non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgment by management in determining how they are formulated. Some specific limitations, include but are not limited to, the fact that such non-GAAP financial measures: (a) do not reflect cash outlays for capital expenditures, contractual commitments or liabilities including pension obligations, post-retirement health benefit obligations and income tax liabilities, (b) do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital requirements; and (c) they do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on indebtedness. Additionally, the methods used by the company to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies, limiting the usefulness of these measures. The company urges investors to review the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included in this press release, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate its business.\nThe company presents non-GAAP financial measures, such as Free Cash Flow, Net Debt, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted net income, because it believes they provide investors, financial analysts and the public with additional information to measure performance and evaluate the company’s ability to service its debt and may be useful for comparing its operating performance with the performance of other companies that have different financing and capital structures and tax rates. The company further believes these measures may be useful for period-over-period comparisons of underlying business trends and its ongoing operations. See “RECONCILIATION OF GAAP TO NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2018” below for reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures.\nConstant currency\nConstant-currency comparisons are based on translating local currency amounts in the prior-year period at actual foreign exchange rates for the current year. The company routinely evaluates its financial performance on a constant-currency basis in order to facilitate period-to-period comparisons without regard to the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates.\nLEVI STRAUSS & CO.
