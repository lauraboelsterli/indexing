    "text": "ROCKAWAY, N.J., Sussex Bancorp (the “Company”) (Nasdaq:SBBX), the holding company for Sussex Bank (the “Bank”), today reported net income of $1.3 million, or $0.17 per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $2.0 million, or $0.43 per basic and diluted share, for the same period last year. The decrease in net income was mainly attributable to merger-related costs associated with the January 4 th merger of Community Bank of Bergen County (“Community Bank”), NJ with and into the Bank, partially offset by an increase in net income due to the addition of Community Bank’s operations following the merger. As of January 4, 2018, Community Bank had total assets, loans and deposits of $343.8 million, $236.1 million and $301.2 million, respectively. The first quarter of 2018 included the independent operations and expenses of both the Company and Community Bank, until March 26, 2018 when the Company completed all systems integrations and are now operating under one company platform.\nThe Company’s net income, adjusted for tax effected merger-related expenses of $2.4 million, increased $1.7 million, or 82.8%, to $3.7 million, or $0.47 per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period last year. The Company’s return on average assets, adjusted for tax effected merger-related expenses of $2.4 million, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was 1.10%, an increase from 0.94% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nThe Company announced a new name and brand identity following its recent partnership with Community Bank of Bergen County, NJ. The new name, “SB One Bancorp”, is being presented for shareholder vote at its Annual Meeting scheduled for later today. The Company is also rebranding the name and logo of its subsidiary Bank to “SB One Bank” as well as the Bank’s wholly owned subsidiary “SB One Insurance Agency”.\n“Our merger was built upon a shared vision, and in coming together we made a choice to do so under one name,” said Anthony Labozzetta, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sussex Bancorp. “This merger created opportunities for us to refresh and elevate our brand, and we wholeheartedly embraced the process. We are excited to share these details with our customers; however, we want to reinforce that despite our new name and shiny new exterior, we are the same bank that our customers have come to trust.”\nMr. Labozzetta also stated, “I am very excited to report on our solid first quarter results inclusive of our merger with Community Bank as well as another quarter of strong performance by all of our business lines. Our growth continues to be organically generated and our production pipelines remain robust, which support future targeted growth expectations on a larger balance sheet. Mr. Labozzetta went on to say, “I’m also pleased to report that our 15 th banking center, which will be located in a great market in Weehawken NJ (Hudson County), is anticipated to open during the third quarter of this year.\"\nFinancial Performance\nNet Income. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported net income of $1.3 million, or $0.17 per basic and diluted share, as compared to net income of $2.0 million, or $0.43 per basic and diluted share, for the same period last year. The decrease in net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was driven by a $5.6 million, or 94.0%, increase in non-interest expenses largely due to merger-related expenses of $3.3 million. The aforementioned decrease was partially offset by a $4.0 million, or 59.5%, increase in net interest income resulting from strong loan and deposit growth, a $380 thousand increase in non-interest income, and a $616 thousand decrease in income tax expense. The increases and decreases were largely attributable to the merger with Community Bank.\nThe Company’s net income, adjusted for tax effected merger-related expenses of $2.4 million, increased $1.7 million, or 82.8%, to $3.7 million, or $0.47 per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same period last year.\nNet Interest Income . Net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis increased $4.1 million, or 58.7%, to $11.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $6.9 million for the same period in 2017. The increase in net interest income was largely due to a $423.1 million, or 51.3%, increase in average interest earning assets, principally loans receivable, which increased $361.9 million, or 51.6%. The net interest margin increased by 17 basis points to 3.56% for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period in 2017. These increases were largely attributable to the merger with Community Bank.\nProvision for Loan Losses. Provision for loan losses increased $101 thousand to $508 thousand for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $407 thousand for the same period in 2017.\nNon-interest Income. Non-interest income increased $380 thousand, or 15.3%, to $2.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period last year. The increase was principally due to growth of $148 thousand in insurance commissions and fees relating to Tri-State Insurance Agency, an increase of $133 thousand in other income and an increase of $79 thousand in bank owned life insurance. The aforementioned was partly offset by a reduction in gain on sales of securities of approximately $107 thousand.\nNon-interest Expense. The Company’s non-interest expenses increased $5.6 million, or 94.0%, to $11.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period last year. The increase was largely due to merger-related expenses of $3.3 million related to the acquisition of Community Bank and increases in salaries and employee benefits of $1.5 million as a result of the merger with Community Bank.\nIncome Tax Expense. The Company’s income tax expenses decreased $616 thousand, or 74.1% to $215 thousand for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period last year. The Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 14.1%, as compared to 29.2% for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in the Company’s tax rate was largely due to the Tax Act and the merger with Community Bank which resulted in the Company’s tax free income becoming a larger percentage of its overall income.\nFinancial Condition\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company’s total assets were $1.4 billion, an increase of $397.2 million, or 40.6%, as compared to total assets of $979.4 million at December 31, 2017. The increase was largely attributable to the merger with Community Bank.\nTotal loans receivable, net of unearned income, increased $267.7 million, or 32.6%, to $1.1 billion at March 31, 2018, as compared to $820.7 million at December 31, 2017. The merger with Community Bank resulted in an increase in total loans of $236.1 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company also had $33.1 million of commercial loan production, which was partly offset by $12.6 million in commercial loan payoffs.\nThe Company’s total deposits increased $280.8 million, or 36.8%, to $1.0 billion at March 31, 2018, from $762.5 million at December 31, 2017, primarily driven by the merger with Community Bank. The growth in deposits was mostly due to an increase in interest bearing deposits of $208.6 million, or 33.8%, and non-interest bearing deposits of $72.3 million, or 49.4%, at March 31, 2018, as compared to December 31, 2017, respectively.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company’s total stockholders’ equity was $146.2 million, an increase of $52.0 million when compared to December 31, 2017, largely due to the merger with Community Bank. The Company completed the merger on January 4, 2018 which was the primary driver in an increase in book value per common share of 18.2% from $15.59 at December 31, 2017 to $18.43 at March 31, 2018. At March 31, 2018, the leverage, Tier I risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and common equity Tier I capital ratios for the Bank were 10.90%, 13.58%, 14.33% and 13.58%, respectively, all in excess of the ratios required to be deemed “well-capitalized.”\nAsset and Credit Quality\nThe ratio of non-performing assets (“NPAs”), which include non-accrual loans, loans 90 days past due and still accruing, troubled debt restructured loans currently performing in accordance with renegotiated terms and foreclosed real estate, to total assets increased to 1.07% at March 31, 2018 from 0.94% December 31, 2017. NPAs exclude $3.7 million of Purchased Credit-Impaired (“PCI”) loans acquired through the merger with Community Bank. NPAs increased $5.5 million, or 60.1%, to $14.8 million at March 31, 2018, as compared to $9.2 million at December 31, 2017. Non-accrual loans, excluding $3.7 million of PCI loans, increased $3.1 million, or 51.1%, to $9.1 million at March 31, 2018, as compared to $6.0 million at December 31, 2017. Loans past due 30 to 89 days totaled $13.6 million at March 31, 2018, representing an increase of $7.1 million, or 109.3%, as compared to $6.5 million at December 31, 2017.\nThe Company continues to actively market its foreclosed real estate properties, the value of which increased $1.3 million to $3.5 million at March 31, 2018 as compared to $2.3 million at December 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, the Company’s foreclosed real estate properties had an average carrying value of approximately $253 thousand per property.\nThe allowance for loan losses increased $493 thousand, or 6.7%, to $7.8 million, or 0.72% of total loans, at March 31, 2018, compared to $7.3 million, or 0.89% of total loans, at December 31, 2017. The decline in allowance coverage was primarily driven by the addition of Community Bank acquired loans with no allowance for loan losses; such loans were recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. The Company recorded $508 thousand in provision for loan losses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $407 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Additionally, the Company recorded net charge-offs of $15 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $306 thousand in net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non-accrual loans decreased to 86.1% at March 31, 2018 from 121.8% at December 31, 2017.\nAbout Sussex Bancorp\nSussex Bancorp (Nasdaq:SBBX) is the holding company for Sussex Bank which is headquartered in Sussex County, New Jersey and operates regionally with fourteen branch locations throughout Bergen, Sussex and Warren counties in New Jersey and in Astoria, New York.
