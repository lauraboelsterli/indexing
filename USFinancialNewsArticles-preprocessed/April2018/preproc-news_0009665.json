    "text": "98 COMMENTS President Donald Trump anticipates sending 2,000 to 4,000 National Guard troops to the border with Mexico.\nThe president described the plan to reporters aboard Air Force One after an event Thursday in West Virginia. He said administration officials are still reviewing the costs of the plan.\n“We’ll probably keep them or a large portion of them” until a border wall is built, Mr. Trump said of the planned deployment.\nEarlier in the day, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said she is working with the governors of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California on the deployment plan to “start the negotiations.” The Republican governors of Texas, Arizona and New Mexico have expressed support for the move.\nIn California, Democrat Jerry Brown has referred questions to the state’s National Guard Bureau, where an official said they are waiting for details from the federal government. The state has fought the Trump administration’s immigration-enforcement policies in court several times. Last year, it passed a law that limits when and how local law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\nThe Department of Homeland Security said officials are still working on details about what jobs National Guard troops will perform and haven’t yet decided what gear they may carry, including whether or not the troops will be armed.\nAlso Thursday, the Border Patrol said about 37,000 people were caught crossing the Mexican border into the U.S. illegally last month. Nearly 13,000 others were taken into custody at legal crossing points along the border.\nDuring March 2018, about 12,000 people were arrested crossing the border illegally. Illegal border crossings plummeted in the first months of the Trump administration and have risen steadily since then, the Border Patrol said.",
