    "text": "LONDON, April 13 (Reuters) - Russia’s embassy in Britain said on Friday that Moscow was concerned by a decision taken by British ministers on Thursday to take action in Syria, saying reports of a planned military attack would represent a “reckless” move by London.\nThe embassy said in a statement that Russian officials who visited the town of Douma in Syria - the site of a suspected chemical weapons attack, according to the United States and its allies - did not find traces of chemical substances.\nThe World Health Organisation said this week an estimated 500 patients in Douma went to health facilities with “signs and symptoms consistent with exposure to toxic chemicals”.
