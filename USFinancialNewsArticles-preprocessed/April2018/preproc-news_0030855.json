Slideshow (8 Images) \nTo make matters worse for Dortmund, their forward Michy Batshuayi had to be taken off on a stretcher off with an injury in stoppage time. The 24-year-old Belgian is on loan from Chelsea until the end of the season. \nSchalke are second on 55 points with Dortmund dropping to fourth on 51, behind third-placed Bayer Leverkusen on goal difference, after they beat Eintracht Frankfurt 4-1 on Saturday.The top four teams qualify for the Champions League group stage. \nAlready-champions Bayern Munich crushed Borussia Moenchengladbach 5-1 on Saturday. \nRB Leipzig can move into fifth place with a win at Werder Bremen later on Sunday.
