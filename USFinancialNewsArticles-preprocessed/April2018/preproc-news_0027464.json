Soccer Football - Champions League Quarter Final Second Leg - Bayern Munich vs Sevilla - Allianz Arena, Munich, Germany - April 11, 2018 Bayern Munich coach Jupp Heynckes gestures REUTERS/Michaela Rehle \nThe first legs will be on Tuesday 24 and Wednesday 25 April, with the returns on May 1 and 2. \nGerman champions Bayern and holders Real have met 24 times in Europe’s premier competition and have eleven wins each from those encounters. \nThe pair clashed at the semi-finals stage in 2014 when the Spanish club won 5-0 on aggregate. They also met last season in the last eight when Real triumphed 6-3 on aggregate. \n“I have to say, it’s a cracking tie. A gigantic fixture, in a very positive way,” said Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes, whose club have been knocked out by Spanish opposition in the last four seasons. \nHaving become the first side to win back-to-back titles in the Champions League era last season, Real Madrid want to be the first club since Bayern (1974–76) to claim three successive European Cups. \nEmilio Butragueno, Real Madrid’s Director of Institutional Relations said: “We need to get a good result in Munich to then take it back to the Bernabeu. At this stage of the competition it’s impossible that you don’t suffer. \n“If we have to do so in order to get to the final, so be it. We really want to be there. It’s been a tough Champions League thus far drawing Paris (St Germain), Juve and now Bayern.” \nLiverpool will have happy memories of their meeting with Roma in the 1984 European Cup final which was played in the Italian capital with the English side winning on penalties. \nThe game will reunite Liverpool’s top scorer this season, Mohamed Salah, with his former club. \nThe Premier League side will host Roma at Anfield on Tuesday, April 24 with Real at Bayern on Wednesday, April 25. \nThe Germans visit the Spanish capital on May 1 with Roma’s Olympic Stadium hosting Liverpool on May 2.
