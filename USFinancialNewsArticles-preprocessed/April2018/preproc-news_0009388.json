    "text": "ANKARA, April 4 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday that Syria’s territorial integrity depended on maintaining distance from all terrorist organisations, a reference to U.S. support for a Syrian Kurdish militia Ankara considers an enemy.\nErodgan also said that hope for success in Syria was growing stronger. He made the comments at a joint news conference with Iran’s Hassan Rouhani and Russian President Vladimir Putin following a three-way summit in Ankara on Syria.
