On-warrant inventories - those not earmarked for delivery and available to the market - rose 3,350 tonnes after five straight days of declines.\n* ALUMINIUM TECHNICALS: LME aluminium may test support at $2,152 a tonne, a break below which could cause a loss to the next support at $2,078, Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao said in a report.\n* RUSSIA: Russia’s En+ Group, owned by sanctions-hit businessman Oleg Deripaska, said its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer resigned on Tuesday, with replacements appointed to both posts.\n* ALNORTE: Norsk Hydro ASA has halted alumina output at two of seven production lines at its Alunorte alumina refinery in Brazil, its CEO said on Wednesday.\n* ZINC STOCKS: Zinc inventories in LME warehouses MZN-STOCKS, which hit their lowest in a decade in February, surged 28,150 tonnes or 15.5 percent, the exchange data showed on Wednesday. LME zinc ended down 2.4 percent at $3,135 a tonne, the biggest faller among industrial metals.\n* COPPER PRICES: Bellwether industrial metal copper finished the day down 0.1 percent at $7,008 a tonne.\n* OTHER METALS: Nickel closed 1.1 percent higher at $14,145 a tonne, up for the first time in five days. It fell from its April 19 peak of $16,690, a three-year high, as fears of sanctions spreading eased. Tin finished up 0.7 percent at $21,250, and lead ended at $2,306, down 0.2 percent.\nReporting by Jan Harvey; additional reporting by Tom Daly in Beijing; Editing by Adrian Croft/David Evans\n ",
