    "text": "MTY subsidiary acquires Canadian-based brands as Le Duff shifts focus to French bakery-café segment\nDALLAS, April 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Le Duff America, the Dallas-based affiliate of global French bakery-café leader Groupe Le Duff, has completed the sale of two of its Canadian brands, Timothy's World Coffee and mmmuffins, to a wholly owned subsidiary of MTY Food Group Inc.\nAt closing, the sale included a total of 32 franchised and seven corporate locations between the two brands for $1.7 million. Le Duff America will continue operating in Canada with its Brioche Dorée, Au Pain Doré and Michel's brands.\n\"The closing of this sale completes Le Duff's transition to a French-focused café-bakery company,\" said Le Duff America CEO Olivier Poirot. \"It is also the capstone of a phenomenal year as we've successfully executed our strategy to refranchise la Madeleine and develop a U.S. version of Le Duff legacy brand Brioche Dorée.\"\nLe Duff America plans to open its first traditional U.S. location of Brioche Dorée in Washington, D.C., in October 2018. The new restaurant will serve as a prototype for future U.S. locations of the global brand, which offers Parisian-style and urban French cuisine, with fresh-baked breads and pastries and housemade sandwiches, soups and more at over 500 locations worldwide.\nIn addition to the upcoming U.S. Brioche Dorée launch and expansion, Le Duff America has inked development deals for 111 new locations of its la Madeleine French Bakery & Café brand in existing and new markets.\nAbout Le Duff America Inc.\nLe Duff America Inc. is owned by Rennes, France-based Groupe Le Duff , which was founded by Louis Le Duff in 1976 and serves more than 1 million customers daily at its nearly 2,000 bakery-cafés worldwide.
