    "text": "MCLEAN, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI) (“Gannett”) today announced its intention to offer, subject to market and other conditions, $175 million principal amount of Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Gannett expects to grant the initial purchaser of the notes an option to purchase up to an additional $26.25 million principal amount of notes, exercisable within a 30-day period.\nThe notes will be general unsecured obligations of Gannett, and interest will be payable semi-annually in arrears. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding January 15, 2024, the notes will be convertible at the option of the holders only upon the satisfaction of certain circumstances. Thereafter, the notes will be convertible at the option of the holders at any time until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding maturity on April 15, 2024. Upon conversion, Gannett will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election, subject to certain restrictions.\nGannett will not be able to redeem the notes prior to April 15, 2022. On or after April 15, 2022, Gannett will be able to redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, at its option, if the last reported sale price of the common stock is equal to or greater than 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. Holders of the notes will be able require Gannett to repurchase their notes upon a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the repurchase date.\nThe interest rate, initial conversion rate and conversion price and the other terms of the notes will be determined at the time of the pricing of the offering.\nGannett intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Borrowings under Gannett’s revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions of or investments in businesses or assets, funding for working capital, capital expenditures, repayment of other debt and repurchases of our common stock.\nThe notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws.\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the notes, nor shall there be any sale of the notes in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
