    "text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky., April 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Churchill Downs Incorporated (Nasdaq:CHDN) (\"CDI\" or the \"Company\") today reported business results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nNet revenue of $189.3 million, 13% increase over the prior year Net income of $182.0 million compared to $7.3 million in the prior year Adjusted net income of $15.8 million compared to $2.2 million in the prior year Diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") of $12.55 compared to $0.44 in the prior year Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.09 compared to $0.13 in the prior year Adjusted EBITDA of $49.2 million, 36% increase over the prior year\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS First Quarter (in millions, except per share data): 2018 2017 Net revenue $ 189.3 $ 167.5 Net income $ 182.0 $ 7.3 Adjusted net income (a) $ 15.8 $ 2.2 Diluted EPS $ 12.55 $ 0.44 Adjusted diluted EPS (a) $ 1.09 $ 0.13 Adjusted EBITDA (a) $ 49.2 $ 36.3 (a) This is a non-GAAP measure. See explanation of non-GAAP measures below.\n\"Our adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was up 36% compared to prior year on the strength of our Casino and TwinSpires segments,” said Bill Carstanjen, Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “Looking forward, we are a little over a week away from the 144th running of the Kentucky Derby and are excited to show our guests the myriad of improvements to our facility that we have made over the last year.\"\nOn January 9, 2018, the Company closed the sale of its mobile gaming subsidiary, Big Fish Games Inc. (\"Big Fish Games\"), to Aristocrat Technologies, Inc. for aggregate consideration of approximately $990 million in cash (\"Big Fish Transaction\"). For purposes of our consolidated financial statements and information included in this release prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), the Big Fish Games segment is classified as held for sale and discontinued operations. Therefore, Big Fish Games is excluded from GAAP net revenue, operating income and adjusted EBITDA. Net income and diluted EPS include the results from Big Fish Games' discontinued operations. For purposes of our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows, the Company has included the results of Big Fish Games. See explanation of Non-GAAP measures below.\nNet revenue and adjusted EBITDA will be discussed in more detail below by Operating Segment.\nThe Company's first quarter 2018 net income of $182.0 million compared to $7.3 million for the prior year. Income from continuing operations, net of tax was $14.1 million for the first quarter 2018, compared to $2.2 million for the prior year. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax was $167.9 million, compared to $5.1 million for the prior year.\nThe $11.9 million increase in income from continuing operations, net of tax was due to:\n$11.2 million increase in operating income primarily driven by our Casino and TwinSpires segments;\n$2.2 million decrease in net interest expense associated with lower outstanding debt balances; and\n$0.5 million increase in equity income of our casino equity investments and miscellaneous income, net of tax.\nPartially offsetting these increases was a $2.0 million increase in our income tax provision.\nThe $162.8 million increase in income from discontinued operations, net of tax includes the $168.3 million after-tax gain on the Big Fish Transaction. Partially offsetting this increase was a $5.5 million decrease in Big Fish Games net income.\nThe Company's first quarter 2018 adjusted net income was $15.8 million compared to $2.2 million for the first quarter of 2017, and our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.09 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.13 in the first quarter of 2017. The adjustments remove transaction expenses, pre-opening expenses included in Other Investments, the gain on the Big Fish Transaction, and Big Fish Games net income, as described in our supplemental information to this press release.\nOPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS:\nWe use adjusted EBITDA to evaluate segment performance, develop strategy and allocate resources. We utilize the adjusted EBITDA metric because we believe the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring items is necessary to provide a more accurate measure of our core operating results and enables management and investors to evaluate and compare from period to period our operating performance in a meaningful and consistent manner. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to operating income as an indicator of performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or as an alternative to any other measure provided in accordance with GAAP. Our calculation of adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculation used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.\nThe operating segment summaries below present net revenue from external customers and intercompany revenue from each of our operating segments:\nRacing First Quarter (in millions): 2018 2017 Net revenue $ 26.2 $ 26.1 Adjusted EBITDA (9.4 ) (9.7 )\nFor the first quarter of 2018, net revenue and adjusted EBITDA increased primarily due to the first quarter 2017 impact of a contagious disease outbreak at Fair Grounds Race Course which quarantined horses causing limited field sizes which did not recur in first quarter 2018, as well as the shift in the Louisiana Derby timing from April 2017 to March 2018.\nTwinSpires First Quarter (in millions): 2018 2017 Net revenue $ 63.6 $ 52.3 Adjusted EBITDA 16.5 13.2\nFor the first quarter of 2018, net revenue increased $11.3 million and adjusted EBITDA increased $3.3 million primarily due to an increase in handle of 20.2%, which outpaced the U.S. thoroughbred industry performance by 14.0 percentage points.\nCasino First Quarter (in millions): 2018 2017 Net revenue $ 98.1 $ 87.5 Adjusted EBITDA 44.3 35.3\nFor the first quarter of 2018, net revenue increased $10.6 million from the prior year primarily driven by a $3.3 million increase at Oxford, a $2.9 million increase at Calder, a $2.7 million increase at our Mississippi properties, and a $1.7 million increase at our Louisiana properties, all of which resulted from successful marketing and promotional activities.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $9.0 million primarily driven by:\n$7.8 million increase from our wholly-owned Casino properties, including a $3.4 million increase at our Mississippi properties, a $2.1 million increase at Calder, a $1.3 million increase at Oxford, and a $1.0 million increase at our Louisiana properties, and $1.2 million increase in our Casino equity investments, driven by solid performance at Ocean Downs and Miami Valley Gaming.\nTreasury Management\nAs previously announced, the Company's Board of Directors authorized $500.0 million of the proceeds from the Big Fish Transaction to repurchase shares of the Company through a \"modified Dutch auction\" tender offer. The Company completed the tender offer on February 12, 2018 by repurchasing 1,886,792 shares at a purchase price of $265 per share with an aggregate cost of $500 million, excluding fees and expenses related to the tender offer.\nConference Call\nA conference call regarding this news release is scheduled for Thursday, April 26, 2018 at 9 a.m. ET. Investors and other interested parties may listen to the teleconference by accessing the online, real-time webcast and broadcast of the call at http://ir.churchilldownsincorporated.com/events.cfm , or by dialing (877) 372-0878 and entering the pass code 2276838 at least 10 minutes before the appointed time.

A copy of the Company’s news release announcing quarterly results and relevant financial and statistical information about the period will be accessible at www.churchilldownsincorporated.com .\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to the results provided in accordance with GAAP, the Company also uses non-GAAP measures, including adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS exclude impairment of tangible and intangible assets; gain or loss on disposal of assets; discontinued operations net income; loss on modification or extinguishment of debt; certain non-recurring income tax items; transaction expense, which includes acquisition and disposition related charges as well as legal, accounting, and other deal-related expense; pre-opening expense; and certain other charges, recoveries, and expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA includes CDI's portion of the EBITDA from our equity investments.\nAdjusted EBITDA excludes:\nTransaction expense, net which includes: Acquisition and disposition related charges, including fair value adjustments related to earnouts and deferred payments; and Other transaction expense, including legal, accounting, and other deal-related expense; Stock-based compensation expense; Asset impairments; Gain on Calder land sale; Calder exit costs; Loss on extinguishment of debt; and Other charges, recoveries and expenses\nFor purposes of segment reporting, adjusted EBITDA includes intercompany revenue and expense totals that are eliminated in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Refer to the reconciliation of comprehensive income to adjusted EBITDA included herewith for additional information.\nThe Company uses non-GAAP measures as a key performance measure of the results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance internally. The measure facilitates comparison of operating performance between periods and helps investors to better understand the operating results of CDI by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the Company's core business or operating results. The Company believes the use of this measure enables management and investors to evaluate and compare, from period to period, the Company’s operating performance in a meaningful and consistent manner. The non-GAAP measures are a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income or diluted EPS (as determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our operating results.\nDue to the Big Fish Transaction, the Company has presented Big Fish Games as held for sale and discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Company has not allocated corporate and other certain expenses to Big Fish Games consistent with the discontinued operations presentation in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Accordingly, the prior year amounts were reclassified to conform to this presentation.\nAbout Churchill Downs Incorporated\nChurchill Downs Incorporated (\"CDI\") (Nasdaq:CHDN), headquartered in Louisville, Ky., is an industry-leading racing, gaming and online entertainment company anchored by our iconic flagship event - The Kentucky Derby .
