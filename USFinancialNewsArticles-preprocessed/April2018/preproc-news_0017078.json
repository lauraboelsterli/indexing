The driver of the vehicle LaRosa was in drove immediately to a hospital, Atlanta Police Department spokesman Donald Hannah told a news conference. \nPolice believe the shooter was familiar with the entourage or the group of vehicles. Police are not sure if anything happened earlier in the evening that led to the shooting. \nMayweather was in Atlanta to promote a boxing event in Las Vegas on Saturday night, ESPN reported. \nMayweather has said he has retired. The 41-year-old boxer beat mixed martial arts champion Conor McGregor to send his record to a 50-0 in August. Reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee; Editing by Michael Perry",
