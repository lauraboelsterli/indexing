    "text": "STAMFORD, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- WWE (NYSE: WWE) today announced the publication of trending schedules, which provide a perspective of historical results using the Company’s revised segment structure and definition of Adjusted OIBDA. In February of this year, the Company had communicated changes to these reporting elements, which it will reflect in the communication of first quarter 2018 results on May 3, 2018. 1 The revised historical trending schedules 2 (Exhibit 1), which cover the 2015 to 2017 period, and a discussion of these financial reporting changes (Exhibit 2) have been posted to the Company’s corporate website and can be found using the links below.\nExhibit 1: Revised Historical Trending Schedules (2015 – 2017)\nExhibit 2: Financial Reporting Changes Effective with Q1 2018 Results\nThe Company believes that publication of these schedules will facilitate the understanding and evaluation of the Company’s future performance and will enable analysts and investors to update their financial models in advance of the first quarter earnings announcement.\nNotes\n(1) WWE press release, “WWE ® Announces Financial Reporting Changes Effective with Q1 2018 Results,” February 8, 2018.

The Company’s results, however, as shown in the revised historical trending schedules, have not been adjusted for the new standard, i.e., to provide perspective as if the new standard had been adopted at the beginning of the 2015 to 2017 period.

These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, risks relating to: entering, maintaining and renewing major distribution agreements, including our principal domestic television license which currently expires in September 2019; WWE Network (including the risk that we are unable to attract, retain and renew subscribers); our need to continue to develop creative and entertaining programs and events; the possibility of a decline in the popularity of our brand of sports entertainment; the continued importance of key performers and the services of Vincent K. McMahon; possible adverse changes in the regulatory atmosphere and related private sector initiatives; the highly competitive, rapidly changing and increasingly fragmented nature of the markets in which we operate and greater financial resources or marketplace presence of many of our competitors; uncertainties associated with international markets; our difficulty or inability to promote and conduct our live events and/or other businesses if we do not comply with applicable regulations; our dependence on our intellectual property rights, our need to protect those rights, and the risks of our infringement of others’ intellectual property rights; the complexity of our rights agreements across distribution mechanisms and geographical areas; potential substantial liability in the event of accidents or injuries occurring during our physically demanding events including, without limitation, claims relating to CTE; large public events as well as travel to and from such events; our feature film business; our expansion into new or complementary businesses and/or strategic investments; our computer systems and online operations; privacy norms and regulations; a possible decline in general economic conditions and disruption in financial markets; our accounts receivable; our indebtedness; litigation; our potential failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance, which could adversely affect our stock; Vincent K. McMahon exercises control over our affairs, and his interests may conflict with the holders of our Class A common stock; a substantial number of shares are eligible for sale by the McMahons and the sale, or the perception of possible sales, of those shares could lower our stock price; and the relatively small public “float” of our Class A common stock. In addition, our dividend is dependent on a number of factors, including, among other things, our liquidity and historical and projected cash flow, strategic plan (including alternative uses of capital), our financial results and condition, contractual and legal restrictions on the payment of dividends (including under our revolving credit facility), general economic and competitive conditions and such other factors as our Board of Directors may consider relevant. Forward-looking statements made by the Company speak only as of the date made and are subject to change without any obligation on the part of the Company to update or revise them. Undue reliance should not be placed on these statements.
