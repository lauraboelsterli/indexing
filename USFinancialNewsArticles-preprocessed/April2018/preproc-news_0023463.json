REUTERS/ Leah Millis That compared with a budget deficit of $176 billion in the same month last year, according to Treasuryâ€™s monthly budget statement.\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast the Treasury recording a $194 billion shortfall last month.\nWhen accounting for calendar adjustments, the deficit last month was $165 billion compared with an adjusted deficit of $134 billion in the same month in the prior year.\nThe deficit for the fiscal year, which began in October, was $600 billion, compared to a deficit of $527 billion in the same period of fiscal 2017.\nUnadjusted receipts last month totaled $211 billion, down 3 percent from March 2017, while unadjusted outlays grew to $420 billion, up 7 percent from the same month a year earlier.\nReporting by David Lawder and Lindsay Dunsmuir; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ",
