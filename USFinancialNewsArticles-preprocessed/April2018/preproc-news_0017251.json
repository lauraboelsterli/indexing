    "text": "LONDON, April 9 (Reuters) - European Union regulators should immediately start coordinating with their British counterparts to ensure a smooth Brexit next year, the UK’s markets watchdog said on Monday.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority has said financial firms should feel comfortable about relying on a transition deal agreed last month between Britain and the EU.\nEU officials, however, say this was a political deal and won’t be legally ratified until later in the year, meaning firms should continue implementing plans based on a “hard” Brexit next March.\n“We should not hold up the work, in my view,” FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey told reporters.\nHe said UK and EU regulators could start coordinating now so that a system of regulatory coordination is in place, ready to be introduced once transition has been legally ratified.\nThe plans would include ensuring continuity in cross-border derivatives and insurance contracts.
