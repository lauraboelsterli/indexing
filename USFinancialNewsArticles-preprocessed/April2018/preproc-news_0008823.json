    "text": "MANILA, April 3 (Reuters) - The Philippines’ anti-trust agency said on Tuesday it has started a review of Uber Technologies’ deal to sell its Southeast Asian business to ride-hailing rival Grab.\nThe Philippine Competition Commission said in a statement it has reason to believe that the deal “may likely substantially lessen, prevent, or restrict competition”. The PCC’s jurisdiction and review procedures are limited to the Philippines.\nThe Philippines and Malaysia had said on Monday they will look into whether the deal hinders competition, days after Singapore began a probe into the deal on similar concerns.
