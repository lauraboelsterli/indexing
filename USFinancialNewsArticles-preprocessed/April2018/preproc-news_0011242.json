    "text": "TORONTO (Reuters) - Mergers and acquisitions among Canadian companies are expected to pick up pace after a sluggish first quarter, driven by non-resource deals and a rebound in outbound transactions as pension funds and private equity firms put massive pools of capital to work, according to M&A advisers.\nBuildings are seen in the financial district in Toronto, January 28, 2013. REUTERS/Mark Blinch/File Photo Though uncertainty around the renewal of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has weighed on deal activity in some sectors of Canada’s economy, bankers expect a resolution to lift deal volumes.\nMeanwhile, changes to the U.S. tax system under President Donald Trump are seen boosting cross-border activity, they added.\nCanadian M&A activity in the first quarter of the year dropped to $54.2 billion, down 37 percent compared with a year ago, data from Thomson Reuters showed on Thursday, weighed down by lower energy deals which were the biggest driver of 2017 activity.\nToronto-Dominion Bank ( TD.TO ), Lazard ( LAZ.N ) and Citigroup ( C.N ) took the top three spots in the M&A volume rankings for the first quarter, followed by Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), JPMorgan ( JPM.N ) and Bank of America ( BAC.N ).\nBankers expect real estate and industrials to be in focus this year.\n“There’s a prodigious appetite from pension funds and alternative asset managers for high-quality global and Canadian assets,” said Brian Hanson, chief executive of Lazard’s Canadian investment banking division.\nDespite rich valuations, Hanson expects pension funds to pursue new investments, adding: “They’re going to be very disciplined with respect to quality and valuation.”\nThe biggest deal in the first quarter was the Blackstone Group-led ( BX.N ) planned $17 billion acquisition of about 55 percent in Thomson Reuters Corp’s ( TRI.N ) ( TRI.TO ) Financial and Risk business.\nBlackstone also agreed to buy Pure Industrial REIT ( AAR_u.TO ) for about $2 billion.\n“We’re seeing a significant amount of cross-border flows,” said Grant Kernaghan, Citigroup’s managing director of Canadian investment banking.\n“Even in this market where multiples have expanded near historic levels, there’s still an opportunity to make money from a private equity perspective,” he added.\nWhile PE firms were involved with most of the quarter’s biggest deals, U.S. strategic buyers are in a stronger position after the tax changes.\n“The U.S. tax cut on a macro level has huge implications for Canadian M&A,” said Jeremy Fraiberg, co-chair of the M&A group at law firm Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt.\n“With the tax changes, U.S. companies are finding their coffers have more cash and could do more northbound deals as a result,” he said.\nAmong the law firms advising on M&A, Osler came out on top, followed by Weil, Gotshal & Manges and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett.\nReporting by John Tilak; editing by Denny Thomas and G Crosse\n ",
