    "text": "BOISE, Idaho, April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The WinCo Board has appointed Grant Haag, currently WinCo's Senior Vice President of Department Operations, as the new President of the company. Haag will serve as President for the next year, before taking over as CEO when current CEO, Steven Goddard, officially steps down.\nThe naming of Haag to the post is the culmination of an intensive two-year process at WinCo Foods to identify the right person. The three final candidates for the position were thoroughly vetted and each worked incredibly hard, under close scrutiny from the WinCo Board, to make sure that the best-suited individual was selected.\n\"We firmly believe that Grant is the right choice to lead the Company into the future,\" said Goddard.\nHaag is a 34-year veteran of WinCo Foods and has served in several positions, including Produce Department Manager, NW Division/Oregon Produce Supervisor, Vice President of Produce Operations and District Manager, Northwest Division. In September 2015, Haag was appointed Senior Vice President of Department Operations for WinCo Foods. Haag serves on the Board of Directors for the WinCo Foods Foundation, a 501(C)(3) charitable organization, created to support and assist WinCo employee owners and the communities in which WinCo operates. He also serves on the Oregon Executive Committee for the \"City of Hope\" charity foundation, which provides support to one of the world's leading biomedical research and cancer treatments centers.\nTo learn more about employee owned WinCo Foods, go online to WinCoFoods.com , or join the conversation at Facebook.com/winco.official.page , where an online community of hundreds of thousands of smart shoppers share tips, recipes, reviews, coupons and more about WinCo Foods.\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/winco-foods-names-grant-haag-new-president-300638351.html\nSOURCE WinCo Foods",
