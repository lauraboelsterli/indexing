    "text": "(Adds more detail from submission)\nLONDON, April 26 (Reuters) - Facebook will introduce new measures to boost transparency around adverts in Britain by June this year and require political ads to be clearly labeled, the firm's Chief Technology Officer told a British parliamentary committee.\nIn a written submission to the UK parliament's media committee, Mike Schroepfer said those wanting to run political adverts would have to complete an authorization process and the messages would also have to display who paid for them.\nFacebook has said that the personal information of about 87 million users might have been improperly shared with political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Donald Trump's 2016 presidential election campaign.\nLawmakers have also raised concern over the use of social media in Britain's referendum decision to leave the European Union in 2016.\n\"I want to start by echoing our CEO, Mark Zuckerberg: what happened with Cambridge Analytica represents a breach of trust, and we are deeply sorry. We made mistakes and we are taking steps to make sure it doesn't happen again,\" Schroepfer wrote.\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg apologized to U.S. senators for issues that have beset Facebook, including shortcomings over data protection.\nBut the 33-year-old internet mogul managed to deflect any specific promises to support any congressional regulation of the world's largest social media network and other U.S. internet companies.\nSchroepfer, who was appearing before the British media committee on Thursday, said it was clear Facebook had not done enough to ensure its tools from \"potentially being used for harm\" or take a broad enough view of its responsibility.\n\"That was a mistake,\" he wrote.
