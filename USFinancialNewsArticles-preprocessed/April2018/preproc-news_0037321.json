Montreux Jazz Festival Director Mathieu Jaton speaks during an interview with Reuters after announcing performers booked for the 52nd annual edition of the famed Swiss jazz festival in July, in Montreux, Switzerland, April 17, 2018. REUTERS/Pierre Albouy \nPharrell Williams returns to the famed stage with N.E.R.D., while veterans Van Morrison, Gilberto Gil, and Deep Purple are also booked at the prestigious Swiss event from June 29-July 14. \n“I’ve been waiting a long time to have Nick Cave in the Stravinski (Auditorium). His music is so in touch with the acoustics of that hall. His universe is fascinating, with softness, musicality,” festival director Mathieu Jaton told Reuters after announcing the line-up. \nAustralian Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds perform on July 12. \nSnagging Jack White, who plays on July 10, is “very rare”, Jaton said. “There’s great anticipation since his last album. It’s his first time solo in Montreux, he previously came with Dead Weather and The Raconteurs.” Montreux Jazz Festival Director Mathieu Jaton speaks during an interview with Reuters after announcing performers booked for the 52nd annual edition of the famed Swiss jazz festival in July, in Montreux, Switzerland, April 17, 2018. REUTERS/Pierre Albouy \n“Jack White is the passion of sound. He records everything in analog, still records on vinyl. These music freaks who are so attached to the quality of the music and of the performance.” \nMontreux programmers, whose annual budget is 28 million Swiss francs, like to pair up artists for unique shows. \n“The goal is to create an experience that puts artists together. That is our passion in the programing,” Jaton said. Slideshow (3 Images) \n“Nine Inch Nails has never been to Montreux before. What’s great again is this billing with Gary Numan and Nine Inch Nails who have collaborated, they have mutual respect for each other’s music.” \nVan Morrison and Steve Winwood play back-to-back on July 11, while Young Fathers and Massive Attack play on July 2. \nAloe Blacc opens for Zucchero. “American soul with an Italian soul crooner, that creates something interesting,” Jaton said. \nAlice Cooper, Joe Perry and actor Johnny Depp team up as “Hollywood Vampires” on July 5. \nThe Montreux Jazz Club is moving to the Petit Palais, to be known as “House of Jazz”, but still an intimate setting with small tables. \n“We’ll have 600 places, doubling our capacity. There was so much demand. Stanley Clarke, Brad Mehldau, Chick Corea, all the big jazz names will be there,” Jaton said. \nAmerican Grammy-winning pianist Robert Glasper and his band R+R=NOW perform there on July 8 at a special show featuring former Montreux co-director Quincy Jones, he said. “An evening that really touches me, with beautiful surprises and a jam.” Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Hugh Lawson",
