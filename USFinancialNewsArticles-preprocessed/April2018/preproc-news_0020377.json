    "text": "WASHINGTON, April 11 (Reuters) - U.S. bank regulators on Wednesday proposed easing a key rule designed to restrict bank leverage in a move that will free up $400 million of capital across the largest eight U.S. banks.\nThe proposal from the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency would reduce the so-called “enhanced supplementary leverage ratio” from 5 percent to 3 percent and tie an additional capital charge to the bank’s risk profile.\nReporting by Michelle Price Editing by Chris Reese\n ",
