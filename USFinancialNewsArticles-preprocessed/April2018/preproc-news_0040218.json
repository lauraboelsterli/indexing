(NASDAQ:AXSM), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for the management of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced the appointment of Nick Pizzie, CPA, MBA, as Chief Financial Officer (CFO), effective May 16, 2018.\n“Nick’s diverse financial experience and expertise make him a strong addition to the Axsome team,” said Herriot Tabuteau, MD, Chief Executive Officer of Axsome. “We are excited to have him join and look forward to his contributions as we continue to advance our broad pipeline of late-stage CNS product candidates.”\nPrior to joining Axsome, Mr. Pizzie was the Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Pierre Fabre USA, the U.S. affiliate of Pierre Fabre, a $2.5 billion global pharmaceutical company. Previously, he was Senior Finance Director at Immucor. Prior to Immucor, he held positions of increasing responsibility in finance and accounting at Merck and Pfizer. Mr. Pizzie began his career at Arthur Andersen, where he served as staff auditor. He earned his BS in Accounting, BA in Economics, and MBA in Finance, and Supply Side Logistics, from Rutgers University.\n“It is a tremendous opportunity to join Axsome during this acceleration in the company’s growth trajectory,” said Mr. Pizzie. “I look forward to working with the rest of the management team and contributing my skills to help the company achieve its mission of developing differentiated medicines to improve the lives of patients living with CNS disorders.”\nMr. Pizzie will replace John Golubieski, CFO, who submitted his resignation on April 13, 2018, effective May 9, 2018, to pursue other opportunities. “We would like to thank John for his service and contributions to Axsome,” said Dr. Tabuteau.\nAbout Axsome Therapeutics, Inc.\nAxsome Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for the management of central nervous system (CNS) disorders for which there are limited treatment options.
