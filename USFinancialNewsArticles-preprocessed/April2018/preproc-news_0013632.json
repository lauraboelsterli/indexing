    "text": "Shohei Ohtani gave up one hit and struck out 12 over seven scoreless innings, leading the Los Angeles Angels to a 6-1 win over the Oakland A’s on Sunday afternoon in Anaheim, Calif.\nOhtani retired the first 19 batters he faced, throwing a perfect game until Marcus Semien lined a 2-0 fastball into left field for a single with one out in the seventh.\nOhtani (2-0) walked one while making 91 pitches.\nHe got plenty of offensive support, Mike Trout leading the way with a home run, a single, a walk, two RBIs and two runs. Ryan Schimpf also homered for Los Angeles.\nOhtani began the game by striking out the side in the first inning. He continued to march through the A’s lineup, needing just 75 pitches to get through six perfect innings, striking out 11 of the 18 batters he faced.\nThrough those six innings, Oakland batters swung at a pitch 39 times, swinging and missing 23 of them. In his seven innings, Ohtani had 25 swings and misses, the most in the majors this season, surpassing the 23 Washington’s Max Scherzer had on opening day.\nAfter getting Matt Joyce on a soft liner to shortstop to begin the seventh, Ohtani fell behind in the count against Semien before allowing his lone hit.\nOhtani walked the next hitter, Jed Lowrie, but then retired the next two batters to complete the inning, including a strikeout of Matt Olson to finish his day.\nThe Angels gave Ohtani something to work with right away, getting to A’s starter Kendall Graveman in the first inning. With Trout (walk) on first and two out, Albert Pujols hit a full-count pitch into the left field corner for an RBI double. Pujols then scored on a single by Kole Calhoun.\nTrout led off the third with a home run, and when Trout drove in another run with a single in the fourth, Graveman was done for the day. Justin Upton’s sacrifice fly later in inning, the run charged to Graveman, put Los Angeles up 5-0.\nGraveman (0-2) gave up five runs on five hits and four walks in 3 1/3 innings, striking out three.\nSchimpf, just called up from Triple-A Salt Lake on Saturday, was making his first start as an Angel. Besides his home run in the sixth, he also walked twice and scored twice.\nThe A’s scored their only run on a home run by Joyce in the ninth inning off Angels reliever Felix Pena.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
