    "text": "LOS ANGELES, Cathay General Bancorp (the \"Company\", \"we\", \"us\", or \"our\" NASDAQ: CATY), the holding company for Cathay Bank, today announced net income of $63.8 million, or $0.78 per share, for the first quarter of 2018. First quarter 2018 results included a $3.9 million decrease in the fair value of equity securities now recorded in the income statement as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-01, which reduced earnings per share by $.03.\nFINANCIAL PERFORMANCE\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\nNet income\n$63.8 million\n$25.9 million\n$48.9 million\nBasic earnings per common share\n$0.79\n$0.32\n$0.61\nDiluted earnings per common share\n$0.78\n$0.32\n$0.61\nReturn on average assets\n1.65%\n0.66%\n1.42%\nReturn on average total stockholders' equity\n12.99%\n5.18%\n10.73%\nEfficiency ratio\n43.35%\n46.27%\n43.66%\nFIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS\nDiluted earnings per share increased 27.9% to $0.78 per share for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $0.61 per share for the same quarter a year ago. Net interest margin for the first quarter increased to 3.75% compared to 3.49% in first quarter of 2017 and 3.65% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Total deposits increased by $322 million, or 10.2% annualized, to $13.0 billion, for the quarter. Total loans increased $144 million, or 4.5% annualized, to $13.0 billion for the quarter.\n\"For the first quarter of 2018, our total loans increased $144 million or 4.5% annualized to $13.0 billion. Also, our net interest margin increased to 3.75% during the first quarter compared to 3.65% in the fourth quarter of 2017 as our loans repriced more than our deposits,\" commented Pin Tai, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company.\nFurther, Mr. Tai added, \"The systems conversion for Far East National Bank onto Cathay's systems is scheduled for this weekend, which allows us to complete the integration of our operations.\"\nFIRST QUARTER INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW\nNet income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $63.8 million, an increase of $14.9 million, or 30.4%, compared to net income of $48.9 million for the same quarter a year ago. Diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $0.78 compared to $0.61 for the same quarter a year ago. First quarter net income included a $3.9 million decrease in the fair value of equity securities now recorded in the income statement as a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-01, which reduced first quarter 2018 earnings per share by $.03.\nReturn on average stockholders' equity was 12.99% and return on average assets was 1.65% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to a return on average stockholders' equity of 10.73% and a return on average assets of 1.42% for the same quarter a year ago.\nNet interest income before provision for credit losses\nNet interest income before provision for credit losses increased $23.2 million, or 20.7%, to $135.3 million during the first quarter of 2018, compared to $112.1 million during the same quarter a year ago. The increase was due primarily to an increase in interest income from loans and securities, offset by increases in interest expense from time deposits and long-term debt.\nThe net interest margin was 3.75% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 3.49% for the first quarter of 2017 and 3.65% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the yield on average interest-earning assets was 4.42%, the cost of funds on average interest-bearing liabilities was 0.92%, and the cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.81%. In comparison, for the first quarter of 2017, the yield on average interest-earning assets was 4.07%, the cost of funds on average interest-bearing liabilities was 0.80%, and the cost of interest-bearing deposits was 0.69%. The increase in the yield on average interest earning assets resulted mainly from higher rates on loans. The net interest spread, defined as the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and the cost of funds on average interest-bearing liabilities, was 3.50% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to 3.27% for the same quarter a year ago.\nReversal for credit losses\nReversal for credit losses was $3.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $2.5 million for the first quarter of 2017. The reversal for credit losses was based on a review of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2018. The following table summarizes the charge-offs and recoveries for the periods indicated:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nMarch 31, 2017\n(In thousands)\nCharge-offs:\nCommercial loans\n$ 19\n$ 1,503\n$ 1,204\nReal estate loans (1)\n-\n-\n555\nTotal charge-offs\n19\n1,503\n1,759\nRecoveries:\nCommercial loans\n913\n2,001\n491\nConstruction loans\n44\n86\n49\nReal estate loans (1)\n867\n1,160\n296\nTotal recoveries\n1,824\n3,247\n836\nNet (recoveries)/charge-offs\n$ (1,805)\n$ (1,744)\n$ 923\n(1) Real estate loans include commercial mortgage loans, residential mortgage loans, and equity lines.\nNon-interest income\nNon-interest income, which includes revenues from depository service fees, letters of credit commissions, securities gains (losses), wire transfer fees, and other sources of fee income, was $5.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of $1.4 million, or 20.9%, compared to $6.7 million for the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to a $3.9 million decrease in the fair value of equity securities and offset by an increase in other operating income of $1.5 million.\nNon-interest expense\nNon-interest expense increased $9.1 million, or 17.5%, to $61.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $51.9 million in the same quarter a year ago. The increase in non-interest expense in the first quarter of 2018 was primarily due to a $4.5 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, partly from the acquisition of Far East National Bank, and a $1.8 million increase in professional services expense when compared to the same quarter a year ago. The efficiency ratio was 43.4% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 43.7% for the same quarter a year ago.\nIncome taxes\nThe effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 22.8% compared to 29.5% for the first quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate includes the reduction of the corporate tax rate from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the impact of low income housing tax credits. Income tax expense for the first quarter of 2018 was also reduced by $0.7 million in benefits from the distribution of restricted stock units and exercises of stock options.\nBALANCE SHEET REVIEW\nGross loans, excluding loans held for sale, were $13.0 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $144 million, or 1.1%, from $12.9 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to increases of $136.7 million, or 4.5%, in residential mortgage loans, and $127.6 million, or 2.0%, in commercial mortgage loans, partially offset by decreases of $90.9 million, or 13.4%, in real estate construction loans, and $24.8 million, or 1.0%, in commercial loans.

The $122.1 million allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2018, decreased $1.2 million, or 1.0%, from $123.3 million at December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses represented 0.94% of period-end gross loans, excluding loans held for sale, and 247.5% of non-performing loans at March 31, 2018. The comparable ratios were 0.96% of period-end gross loans, excluding loans held for sale, and 252.7% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2017.

Total non-performing assets increased $390 thousand, or 0.7%, to $58.6 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $58.2 million at December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase of $541 thousand, or 1.1%, in non-accrual loans and offset by a decrease of $151 thousand, or 1.6%, in other real estate owned.\nCAPITAL ADEQUACY REVIEW\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.47%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 12.47%, total risk-based capital ratio of 14.37%, and Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 10.59%, calculated under the Basel III capital rules, continue to place the Company in the \"well capitalized\" category for regulatory purposes, which is defined as institutions with a common equity tier 1 capital ratio equal to or greater than 6.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio equal to or greater than 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio equal to or greater than 10%, and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio equal to or greater than 5%.
