    "text": "TORONTO, April 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Canadian Banc Corp. (The \"Company\") declares its monthly distribution of $0.11183 for each Class A share and $0.04167 for each Preferred share. Distributions are payable May 10, 2018 to shareholders on record as at April 30, 2018.\nUnder the distribution policy announced in September 2013, the monthly dividend payable on the Class A shares is determined by applying a 10% annualized rate on the volume weighted average market price (VWAP) of the Class A shares over the last 3 trading days of the preceding month. As a result, Class A shareholders of record on April 30, 2018 will receive a dividend of $0.11183 per share based on the VWAP of $13.42 payable on May 10, 2018. The yield will remain stable at 10.00% (based on the VWAP) under this distribution policy.\nPreferred shareholders continue to receive prime plus 0.75% with a minimum rate of 5.00%.\nSince inception Class A shareholders have received a total of $13.63 per share and Preferred shareholders have received a total of $6.81 per share inclusive of this distribution, for a combined total of $20.45.\nThe Company invests in a portfolio of six publicly traded Canadian Banks as follows: Bank of Montreal, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Nova Scotia, Toronto-Dominion Bank. Shares held within the portfolio are expected to range between 5-20% in weight but may vary at any time. To generate additional returns above the dividend income earned on the portfolio, The Company engages in a selective covered call writing program.\nDistribution Details Class A Share (BK) $0.11183 Preferred Share (BK.PR.A) $0.04167 Ex-Dividend Date: April 27, 2018 ï»¿Record Date: April 30, 2018 Payable Date: May 10, 2018 Investor Relations: 1-877-478-2372\nLocal: 416-304-4443\nhttp://www.quadravest.com/\ninfo@quadravest.com\nSource:Canadian Banc Corp.",
