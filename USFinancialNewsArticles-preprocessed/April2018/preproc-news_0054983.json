    "text": "HOUSTON (Reuters) - Valero Energy Corp said on Thursday it began a planned overhaul of the gasoline-producing unit at its 225,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Texas City, Texas, refinery while it repairs an alkylation unit damaged in an April 19 fire.\nValero had planned to overhaul the 88,000 bpd gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit along with the 12,000 bpd alkylation unit in the fall of this year. The April 19 fire broke out on a depropanizer tower in the alkylation unit.\nReporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ",
