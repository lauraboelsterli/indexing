    "text": "GAZA (Reuters) - Political rivals accused Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Sunday of pushing ahead with a rare and disputed national decision-making meeting to tighten his grip on power and sideline them.\nPalestinian parliament deputy speaker Ahmed Bahar of Hamas speaks during the Palestinian National Popular Conference in Gaza City April 29, 2018. REUTERS/Mohammed Salem Abbas has billed Monday’s convening of the Palestinian National Council (PNC), a 700-member assembly within the umbrella Palestinian Liberation Organisation, as a chance to forge a united front against Israel and the United States.\nBut the event in Ramallah, the Palestinian hub in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, has revived old feuds between Abbas’s Fatah party and rivals from Islamist and other factions, many of whose members cannot attend due to Israeli restrictions.\nLast week, 109 PNC members urged Abbas to postpone the meeting to allow greater participation. The call went unheeded, and on Sunday, censure of the president became more pointed.\nKhalil al-Hayya, deputy head of Hamas in Gaza, gestures during the Palestinian National Popular Conference in Gaza City April 29, 2018. REUTERS/Mohammed Salem “The PNC meeting that will be held in Ramallah is not legitimate, is factional, and does not represent all of the Palestinians,” Mushir Al-Masri, a lawmaker with the Islamist group Hamas, told reporters at a meeting of PNC critics in Gaza.\nThe Gaza Strip, under de facto Hamas control since 2007, has been a focus of Palestinian infighting. Though Hamas formally resubmitted to Abbas’s authority last year, their reconciliation has been held up by disputes over power-sharing.\nSlideshow (3 Images) “We stress the need to regain Palestinian unity and end the policy of exclusion and unilateralism by the leadership of the Palestinian Authority and its hijacking of Palestinian institutions,” said Masri.\nKhader Habib of Islamic Jihad, a Hamas political ally, accused Abbas of “holding the PNC meeting to stress his exclusion of all those who oppose him”.\n“The president is keen for the conference to bring about only decisions that suit his own project,” Habib told Reuters.\nHamas and Islamic Jihad oppose Abbas’ strategy of peace talks with Israel. However, diplomacy has been on hold since 2014 and many Palestinians’ views have hardened over U.S. President Donald Trump’s recognition late last year of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital.\nThe PNC last met in extraordinary session in 2009 to replace several members of the PLO’s Executive Committee. It last held a regular session in 1996.\nPolitical analysts in Gaza said a PNC meeting without wide factional representation would weaken the legitimacy of any decisions it may take.\nEarlier on Sunday dozens of masked youths gathered on the Palestinian side of the Gaza Strip’s main crossing with Israel, threatening to block any PNC official from leaving for the West Bank to attend Monday’s session.\nEditing by Mark Heinrich\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
