Organic growth in net revenues during the first quarter totaled 9%, with positive contribution from all four segments. First quarter 2018 GAAP diluted EPS was $1.05 compared to $0.99 in the first quarter of 2017, while non-GAAP diluted EPS 2 was $1.24, an increase of 31% from the first quarter of 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, the company repurchased common shares valued at $99 million. Dividends paid and share repurchases totaled $162 million in the first quarter, and on March 28, 2018, the company announced a 16% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.44 per share. As announced on April 16, 2018, the company achieved another milestone in its strategic pivot by completing the sale of the Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses. The company plans to return the after-tax net proceeds of the sale to shareholders through additional equity repurchases and expects to continue to balance our investment activities toward Market Technology and Information Services.\nNEW YORK, April 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nasdaq, Inc. (Nasdaq:NDAQ) today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2018.\nFirst quarter 2018 net revenues were $666 million, up $85 million, or 15%, from $581 million in the prior year period. The first quarter increase in net revenues included $55 million, or 9%, impact from organic growth, a $17 million favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates and a $13 million impact from acquisitions.\n“We achieved strong results in the first quarter of 2018 through a combination of solid organic growth in our recurring revenues, as well as by maximizing the benefits of higher industry volumes with strong market share,\" said Adena Friedman, President and CEO, Nasdaq . \"Across all of our businesses, we delivered growth through a continued focus on executing for our clients.\"\nMrs. Friedman continued, \"I am also encouraged by the early progress against our 2018 execution priorities. This includes advancing our strategic pivot as an analytics and technology partner, including the recently completed sale of the Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses, which allows us to focus our Corporate Services business on the most strategic services and solutions to our corporate clients. In addition, we continue to expand our pipeline of opportunities in our ‘markets economy’ technology strategy, and build momentum around our competitive position across several core businesses. While industry macro conditions have been developing positively, we remain focused on structurally advancing our capabilities to deliver over the long term for clients and shareholders, across a broad range of environmental backdrops.\"\nGAAP operating expenses were $393 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $58 million from $335 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase primarily reflects higher compensation and benefits expense, depreciation and amortization expense and merger and strategic initiatives expense.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses were $353 million in the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $47 million, or 15%, compared to the first quarter of 2017. This reflects a $19 million increase from acquisitions, an $18 million organic expense increase, including an increase in compensation expense tied to the strong revenue growth in the period, and a $10 million unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.\n“With the re-balancing of our organic investments to focus more on our higher growth opportunities, we believe we are optimizing our resource allocation to support our new strategic direction,\" said Michael Ptasznik, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Nasdaq . \"At the same time, we've become more transparent around our capital plan to drive returns for shareholders. Consistent with our capital deployment framework, we recently announced a 16% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.44 per share, and have planned equity repurchases funded by the after-tax proceeds from the divestiture.\"\nOn a GAAP basis, net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $177 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, compared to $168 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $209 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, compared with $162 million, or $0.95 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. Non-GAAP EPS in the first quarter of 2018 increased 31% versus the prior year period, with U.S. tax reform contributing $0.14 per share, or 15 percentage points, of the increase to non-GAAP EPS year over year.\nAt March 31, 2018, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $405 million and total debt of $4,115 million, resulting in net debt of $3,710 million. This compares to net debt of $3,830 million at December 31, 2017. Share repurchases totaled $99 million during the first quarter of 2018. As of March 31, 2018, there was $627 million remaining under the board authorized share repurchase program.\nUPDATING 2018 NON-GAAP EXPENSE GUIDANCE 3\nThe company is lowering its 2018 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to $1,295 to $1,335 million versus prior expense guidance of $1,375 to $1,415 million, largely to reflect the closing of the divestiture of the Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses in April.\nBUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS\nMarket Services (38% of total net revenues) - Net revenues were $250 million in the first quarter of 2018, up $32 million when compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nEquity Derivatives (12% of total net revenues) - Net equity derivative trading and clearing revenues were $78 million in the first quarter of 2018, up $10 million compared to the first quarter of 2017.

New order intake totaled $55 million in the first quarter of 2018 while the backlog totaled $735 million at March 31, 2018, up 4% from March 31, 2017.\nCORPORATE HIGHLIGHTS\nNasdaq completed the sale of its Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses to West Corporation . On April 16, 2018, the company announced the completion of the sale of its Public Relations Solutions and Digital Media Services businesses to West Corporation, a global leader in technology-enabled services, for approximately $335 million, subject to adjustments. Through a multi-year partnership with West, Nasdaq will continue to provide eligible Nasdaq-listed clients with seamless access to public relations, webcasting and webhosting products and services as part of the terms of the transaction. The completion of the transaction will enable Nasdaq's Corporate Solutions business to focus its efforts on strengthening technology, data and analytics capabilities within its investor relations, governance, risk and compliance solutions.\nMarket Services delivered record quarterly net revenues of $250 million in the first quarter of 2018 through a combination of strong competitive position, stable pricing and rising industry volumes. Market Services net revenue of $250 million in the first quarter featured record quarterly revenue contribution from equity derivatives. While industry volumes in cash equities and equity derivatives markets were at multi-year highs in the first quarter of 2018, Nasdaq’s record equity derivatives revenues reflected the enlarged market share resulting from the successful integration of ISE. Nasdaq’s quarterly cash equities revenues were the highest since early 2016 reflecting increased market share 4 over recent periods, the successful integration of Nasdaq Canada, and generally stable pricing trends.\nMarket Technology order intake totaled $55 million during the first quarter of 2018 while total order backlog totaled $735 million at March 31, 2018. Order intake totaled $55 million in the first quarter of 2018.

For instance, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited will adopt significant technology innovations coming out of the SMARTS lab, including the use of machine intelligence for surveillance.\nNasdaq saw record ETP assets under management tracking Nasdaq indexes. Overall AUM in ETPs benchmarked to Nasdaq's proprietary index families increased to a record $173 billion as of March 31, 2018, up 25% compared to March 31, 2017.

Management uses this non-GAAP information internally, along with U.S. GAAP information, in evaluating our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. We believe our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of results as the items described below do not reflect ongoing operating performance.\nThese measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. We recommend investors review the U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release. When viewed in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than U.S. GAAP measures alone.\nWe understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating expenses to assess operating performance. We use these measures because they highlight trends more clearly in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on U.S. GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our ongoing operating performance.\nAmortization expense of acquired intangible assets: We amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Intangible asset amortization expense can vary from period to period due to episodic acquisitions completed, rather than from our ongoing business operations. As such, if intangible asset amortization is included in performance measures, it is more difficult to assess the day-to-day operating performance of the businesses, the relative operating performance of the businesses between periods and the earnings power of Nasdaq. Performance measures excluding intangible asset amortization expense therefore provide investors with a more useful representation of our businesses’ ongoing activity in each period.\nMerger and strategic initiatives expense: We have pursued various strategic initiatives and completed a number of acquisitions in recent years which have resulted in expenses which would not have otherwise been incurred. These expenses generally include integration costs, as well as legal, due diligence and other third party transaction costs. The frequency and the amount of such expenses vary significantly based on the size, timing and complexity of the transaction. Accordingly, we exclude these costs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures which provide a more meaningful analysis of Nasdaq’s ongoing operating performance or comparison in Nasdaq’s performance between periods.\nOther significant items: We have excluded certain other charges or gains, including certain tax items, that are the result of other non-comparable events to measure operating performance. We believe the exclusion of such amounts allows management and investors to better understand the ongoing financial results of Nasdaq. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, other significant items included a sublease loss reserve charge recorded on space we currently occupy due to excess capacity.\nSignificant tax items : The adjustment to the income tax provision includes the tax impact of each non-GAAP adjustment in addition to the following items:\nThe impact of the newly enacted U.S. tax legislation is related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which was enacted on December 22, 2017. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, we recorded an increase to tax expense of $5 million, which reflects the reduced federal tax benefit associated with state unrecognized tax benefits. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a decrease to tax expense of $89 million, which reflected the estimated impact associated with the enactment of this act. The decrease in tax expense primarily related to the remeasurement of our net U.S. deferred tax liability at the lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate. These amounts may be refined in the future as new information becomes available. Excess tax benefits related to employee share-based compensation of $5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, $10 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and $23 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 reflect the recognition of income tax effects of share-based awards when awards vest or are settled. This item is subject to volatility and will vary based on the timing of the vesting of employee share-based compensation arrangements and fluctuation in our stock price. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a decrease to tax expense of $6 million, which reflects the impact of amending our assertion regarding the indefinite reinvestment of earnings of certain subsidiaries outside the U.S.\nForeign exchange impact: In countries with currencies other than the U.S. dollar, revenues and expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates. Certain discussions in this release isolate the impact of year-over-year foreign currency fluctuations to better measure the comparability of operating results between periods. Operating results excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations are calculated by translating the current period’s results by the prior period’s exchange rates.\nCAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nInformation set forth in this communication contains forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.
