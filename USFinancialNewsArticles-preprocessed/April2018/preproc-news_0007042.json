    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, April 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Customer experience solutions company McorpCX, Inc. (TSXV: MCX, OTCQB: MCCX) (\"McorpCX\" or the \"Company\") today reported its financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n\"We are pleased with our financial progress in 2017, and attribute much of this to a renewed focus on our core consulting and services business, combined with the implementation of cost containment measures intended to improve our cash flow from operations,\" said Michael Hinshaw, McorpCX President and CEO.\n\"We believe that delivering better customer experiences is a powerful, sustainable way for any organization to differentiate from their competition. As such, we continue to evaluate opportunities related to the business of developing and delivering technology-enabled products and services designed to help corporations improve their customer listening and customer experience management capabilities -- with the goal of helping them design and deliver better experiences for their customers,\" concluded Mr. Hinshaw.\nSelect financial highlights for the year ended December 31, 2017:\nRevenue increased by 54% from $1,637,671 in 2016 to $2,514,014 in 2017. The Company reported an EBITDA (1) of ($175,496) in 2017 compared to ($951,673) in 2016 for an 82% improvement. A 64% improvement in net loss for 2017 ($411,073) from our net loss of $1,158,854 for 2016. The Company had a cash balance of $1,616,076 at December 31, 2017 compared to a cash balance of $1,925,744 at December 31, 2016.\nMr. Gregg Budoi, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, stated \"We continue to evaluate strategies focused on ways to create a more complete slate of customer experience solutions for our clients, and to drive additional product and service revenue and growth for the Company.\n\"These strategies may include further software or technology development expenditures; pursuit of mergers, acquisitions or joint ventures with companies that provide complimentary products and services; software licensing arrangements; and investment in additional infrastructure within our Company.\n\"Any potential strategies identified by management will be thoroughly vetted by our board of directors to assess the expected level of enterprise value compared to the various risks, including but not limited to our ability to adequately finance execution of the strategy,\" he concluded.\nA significant portion of the Company's operating expenses were directly related to the costs associated with meeting the continued listing requirements of the TSX Venture Exchange (the \"TSX-V\") in Canada as well as the public reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\") in the United States. In 2017, the Company spent $270,162 on expenses directly related to maintaining its listing on the TSX-V and compliance with the Exchange Act reporting requirements, which was significantly down from the $459,694 invested in these costs in 2016.\nFor a complete discussion of the Company's financial condition and operating results, see our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on EDGAR and with Canadian securities regulators on SEDAR.\nAbout McorpCX\nMcorpCX, Inc.

We consider EBITDA to be a meaningful supplement to net income (loss) as a performance measure primarily because depreciation and amortization expenses are not actual cash costs, and interest and tax expenses are not related to our direct operating activities.\nIn addition, we believe EBITDA is commonly used by investors and other interested parties to evaluate our financial performance. EBITDA does not reflect the impact of a number of items that affect our net income (loss), including financing costs. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from operations as a measure of performance, or as an alternative to net cash from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA is an internal measure and therefore may not be comparable to other companies.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2017\n2016\nNet Income (Loss)\n$\n(411,073)\n$\n(1,158,854)\nDepreciation and Amortization\n(226,599)\n(191,652)\nInterest expense\n(8,978)\n(15,529)\nEBITDA\n$\n(175,496)\n$\n(951,673)\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained in this press release may constitute \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the United States securities laws and applicable Canadian securities legislation. These statements are, in effect, management's attempt to predict future events, and thus are subject to various risks and uncertainties.
