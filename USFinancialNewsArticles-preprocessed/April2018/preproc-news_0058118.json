    "text": "CHICAGO, April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Enova International (NYSE: ENVA), a leading financial technology company offering consumer and small business loans and financing, today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n\"We saw strong demand and stable credit in each of our six growth businesses during the first quarter, resulting in both revenue and earnings exceeding our expectations,\" said David Fisher, Enova's CEO. \"Our good start to the year reinforces our commitment to our focused growth strategy. We're confident our diversified revenue streams, talented employees, best-in-class technology and strong competitive position set us up very well for the remainder of 2018 and beyond.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Summary\nTotal revenue of $254 million in the first quarter of 2018 increased 32% from $192 million in the first quarter of 2017. Gross profit margin was flat compared to the year ago quarter at 57.3%. Net income was $28 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $14 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA of $68 million, a non-GAAP measure, increased from $44 million in the first quarter of 2017.

In addition, the business generated record operating cash flow during the quarter, and we continue to demonstrate market access to support our growth.\"\nEnova ended the first quarter of 2018 with unrestricted cash of $70 million.

These give current expectations or forecasts of future events and reflect the views and assumptions of Enova's senior management with respect to the business, financial condition and prospects of Enova as of the date of this release and are not guarantees of future performance. The actual results of Enova could those indicated by such because of various risks and uncertainties applicable to Enova's business, including, without limitation, those risks and uncertainties indicated in Enova's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q and current reports on Forms 8-K. These risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of Enova to control, and, in many cases, Enova cannot predict all of the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to those indicated by the . When used in this release, the words \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"plans,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates\" and similar expressions or variations as they relate to Enova or its management are intended to identify . Enova cautions you not to put undue reliance on these statements. Enova disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any after the date of this release.\nIn addition to the financial information prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, Enova provides historical non-GAAP financial information. Management believes that presentation of non-GAAP financial information is meaningful and useful in understanding the activities and business metrics of Enova's operations. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of Enova's business that, when viewed with its GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting its business.\nManagement provides non-GAAP financial information for informational purposes and to enhance understanding of Enova's GAAP consolidated financial statements. Readers should consider the information in addition to, but not instead of or superior to, Enova's financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nCombined Loans and Finance Receivables\nEnova has provided combined loans and finance receivables, which is a non-GAAP measure. Enova also reports allowances and liabilities for estimated losses on loans and finance receivables individually and on a combined basis, which are GAAP measures that are included in Enova's financial statements. Management believes these measures provide investors with important information needed to evaluate the magnitude of potential cost of revenue and the opportunity for revenue performance of the loan and finance receivables portfolio on an aggregate basis. Management believes that the comparison of the aggregate amounts from period to period is more meaningful than comparing only the residual amount on Enova's balance sheet since both revenue and the cost of revenue for loans and finance receivables are impacted by the aggregate amount of loans and finance receivables owned by Enova and those guaranteed by Enova as reflected in its financial statements.\nAdjusted Earnings and Adjusted Earnings Per Share\nIn addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, Enova has provided adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share, or, collectively, the Adjusted Earnings Measures, which are non-GAAP measures. Management believes that the presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and facilitates comparison of operating results across a broad spectrum of companies with varying capital structures, compensation strategies, derivative instruments and amortization methods, which provides a more complete understanding of Enova's financial performance, competitive position and prospects for the future. Management also believes that investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as the Adjusted Earnings Measures, to assess operating performance and that such measures may highlight trends in Enova's business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying on financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, management believes that the adjustments shown below are useful to investors in order to allow them to compare Enova's financial results during the periods shown without the effect of certain expense items.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that Enova defines as earnings excluding depreciation, amortization, interest, foreign currency transaction gains or losses, taxes, stock-based compensation, loss on early extinguishment of debt and acquisition related costs, and Adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure that Enova defines as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are used by investors to analyze operating performance and evaluate Enova's ability to incur and service debt and Enova's capacity for making capital expenditures. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are also useful to investors to help assess Enova's estimated enterprise value. The computation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin as presented below may differ from the computation of similarly-titled measures provided by other companies.\nENOVA INTERNATIONAL, INC.
