We had an hydraulic leak in (the last) Melbourne race and were fortunate to finish the race,” a Mercedes spokesman said. \n“Unfortunately we couldn’t repair the box within the six race cycle so need to take a fresh one, incurring the grid penalty.” Writing by Pritha Sarkar in London, Editing by Catherine Evans",
