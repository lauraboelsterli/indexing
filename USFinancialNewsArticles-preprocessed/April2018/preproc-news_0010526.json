    "text": "0 COMMENTS Solution 1 Hang a simple, Asian-inflected light. This lantern’s Asian feel, said Mia Jung, director of interiors for bicoastal firm Ike Kligerman Barkley, links it to the Qing-dynasty bamboo seat, while its simplicity speaks to the bookshelves’ minimalism. The solid banana-fiber shade, laid over copper wire, contrasts nicely with the airy bookshelf and the chair back’s open fretwork. Pinch Soren Lamp, $2,150, thefutureperfect.com \nSolution 2 Couple the pair’s colors in a rug. The rust shades in this Oushak carpet agree with the armchair’s similarly hued frame, said Newton, Mass., designer Erin Gates, while the rug’s worn areas sync with the grays and creams of the IKEA piece. The vintage carpet provides visual warmth as well and, if laid under the seat and shelf, would physically unite the two pieces. $1,410 for 4’5” by 7’7”, oldnewhouse.com \nSolution 3 Plop down a classic but modern planter. Fauzia Khanani of New York’s Studio Fōr selected a hand-painted porcelain “fishbowl” to be used as a planter. Its traditional Chinese shape and geometric pattern jibe with the antique armchair; its high-contrast color scheme reads contemporary, like the shelving.
