(NASDAQ:MKSI), a global provider of technologies that enable advanced processes and improve productivity, today reported first quarter 2018 financial results.\nQuarterly Financial Results (in millions, except per share data) Q1 2018 Q4 2017 GAAP Results Net revenues $554 $512 Gross margin 47.4% 46.6% Operating margin 23.8% 23.4% Net income $105 $77.6 Diluted EPS $1.90 $1.41 Non-GAAP Results Gross margin 47.4% 46.6% Operating margin 26.2% 25.9% Net earnings $114.3 $94.6 Diluted EPS $2.07 $1.71 First Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nRevenue was $554 million, an increase of 8% from $512 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of 27% from $437 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet income was $105 million, or $1.90 per diluted share, compared to net income of $77.6 million, or $1.41 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017, and $65.1 million, or $1.18 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-GAAP net earnings, which exclude special charges and credits, were $114.3 million, or $2.07 per diluted share, compared to $94.6 million, or $1.71 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2017, and $70.0 million, or $1.27 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017.\nSales to semiconductor customers were $313 million, an increase of 26% compared to the first quarter of 2017, and sales to advanced markets were $241 million, an increase of 28% compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nSales in the Vacuum and Analysis Division set another quarterly record of $348 million, an increase of 25% from the first quarter a year ago. Sales in the Light and Motion Division also set another quarterly record of $206 million, an increase of 29% from the prior year period.\n“We are very pleased with our strong start in 2018, which has fueled our ability to achieve our objectives of sustainable and profitable growth,” said Gerald Colella, Chief Executive Officer and President. Mr. Colella added, “We again set new records for quarterly revenue and Non-GAAP net earnings as well as achieving new revenue records in both the semiconductor market and advanced markets we serve. Our strong focus on solving complex customer problems is a significant driver in the 28% year over year revenue growth in our advanced markets. These advanced markets represent almost 45% of our total revenue and provide MKS a unique additive growth opportunity to our strong leading position in the semiconductor market.”\n“We also continue to execute on our strategy to delever our balance sheet and significantly reduce our interest cost,” said Seth Bagshaw, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “In March 2018, we voluntarily pre-paid another $50 million of principal on our Term Loan. Furthermore, on April 11, 2018, we completed our fourth successful repricing of our Term Loan. Our debt balance as of March 31, 2018, was $348 million, down from $780 million at loan origination in April 2016; our debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio is well below one times; and we have reduced our non-GAAP interest expense by over 70% since origination on an annualized basis.”\nAdditional Financial Information\nThe Company had $542 million in cash and short-term investments as of March 31, 2018 and during the first quarter of 2018, MKS paid a dividend of $9.8 million or $0.18 per diluted share.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Outlook\nBased on current business levels, the Company expects that revenue in the second quarter of 2018 could range from $550 to $590 million.\nAt these volumes, GAAP net income could range from $1.91 to $2.18 per diluted share and non-GAAP net earnings could range from $2.09 to $2.36 per diluted share. This financial guidance incorporates assumptions made based upon the Company’s current interpretation of the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act, and may change as additional clarification and implementation guidance is issued.\nConference Call Details\nA conference call with management will be held on Wednesday, April 25, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. (Eastern Time).
