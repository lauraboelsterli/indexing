    "text": "April 9, 2018 / 2:35 PM / Updated 9 minutes ago UPDATE 1-Brazil's Marfrig to buy 51 pct of National Beef; sell Keystone to pay for it Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Changes headline, adds details from the transaction and conference call remarks) \nSAO PAULO, April 9 (Reuters) - Brazil’s Marfrig Global Foods SA said on Monday it would buy control of U.S.-based National Beef Packing Co for $969 million in a deal making it the world’s No. 2 beef processor after JBS SA and sending its shares soaring. \nMarfrig also said it was seeking to sell an existing U.S. unit, Keystone Food LLC, with the proceeds repaying $1 billion in loans taken out to finance the acquisition of 51 percent of National Beef, the United States’ fourth largest beef processor. \nMarfrig, whose shares surged nearly 19 percent, said it expects to complete the sale of Keystone, a processor of poultry and fish as well as beef, in the second quarter. \n“We see little chance of that not happening within that time frame,” Chief Financial Officer Eduardo Miron said during a conference call with analysts. “Keystone is an interesting asset which has performed well.” \nMarfrig declined to provide names of potential bidders or say how much it believes Keystone is worth. JP Morgan will manage the sale, Marfrig said. \nMarfrig’s management said the two transactions were running in parallel without making clear whether they would go ahead with the National Beef purchase if they failed to find a buyer for Keystone. \nRabobank will finance 100 percent of the National Beef acquisition, Marfrig said.
