    "text": "(Reuters) - A Michigan regulatory agency said on Friday it had permanently revoked the medical license of Larry Nassar, the former team USA gymnastics doctor who pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting girls in his care, and fined him a record $1 million.\nFILE PHOTO: Larry Nassar, a former team USA Gymnastics doctor who pleaded guilty in November 2017 to sexual assault, listens to victims impact statements during his sentencing in the Eaton County Circuit Court in Charlotte, Michigan, U.S., January 31, 2018. REUTERS/Rebecca Cook/File Photo The fine levied by the Michigan’s Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs amounts to $250,000 for each of four violations of the state’s public health code.\nThe department said in a written statement the fine was the largest ever issued by a health professional or occupational board in its history and was to be paid after Nassar settles all restitution, criminal fees, fines and civil judgments ordered by the courts.\nNassar, a former faculty member and physician at an on-campus clinic at Michigan State University and a doctor for USA Gymnastics, was sentenced in February to up to 125 years in prison after some 200 young women testified about decades of abuse at his hands.\nHe had already received a sentence of up to 175 years in a different jurisdiction, and was sentenced to a 60-year federal term for child pornography convictions.\nReporting by Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles; Editing by Tom Brown\n ",
