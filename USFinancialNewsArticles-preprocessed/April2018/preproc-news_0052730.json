(Nasdaq:MSBI) (the “Company”) today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2018, which included $11.9 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, of integration and acquisition expenses. Inclusive of these expenses, the Company reported net income of $1.8 million, or $0.08 diluted earnings per share, for the first quarter of 2018. This compares to net income of $2.0 million, or $0.10 diluted earnings per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, and net income of $8.5 million, or $0.52 diluted earnings per share, for the first quarter of 2017. Financial results for the first quarter of 2018 include one month of operations of Alpine Bank, which was acquired on February 28, 2018.\n“Our first quarter performance was highlighted by the completion of our acquisition of Alpine Bancorporation,” said Leon J. Holschbach, Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “Alpine significantly strengthens our franchise by providing a talented team of bankers, an attractive deposit base, and another $1 billion in assets for our wealth management business. Aside from completing the acquisition, we saw a number of positive operating trends during the first quarter including an expansion in our net interest margin, excluding the impact of accretion income, and good expense management. As we integrate Alpine’s operations and work to achieve the synergies we project for this transaction, we believe we will drive additional efficiencies and positively impact our level of profitability in the future.”\nAdjusted Earnings\nFinancial results for the first quarter of 2018 included $11.9 million in integration and acquisition expenses. Excluding these expenses, adjusted earnings were $11.3 million, or $0.52 diluted earnings per share, for the first quarter of 2018.\nFinancial results for the fourth quarter of 2017 included $4.5 million of additional tax expense related to the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax assets, $2.7 million in integration and acquisition expenses, and $0.4 million in loss on mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) held-for-sale. Excluding these expenses, adjusted earnings were $8.4 million, or $0.42 diluted earnings per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe increase in adjusted earnings per share was primarily attributable to the earnings contribution from Alpine Bank and a decrease in the provision for loan losses.\nA reconciliation of adjusted earnings to net income according to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) is provided in the financial tables at the end of this press release.\nFactors Affecting Comparability\nMost recently, Midland acquired Alpine Bancorporation, Inc., Centrue Financial Corporation (“Centrue”) and CedarPoint Investment Advisors (“CedarPoint”) in February 2018, June 2017 and March 2017, respectively. The financial position and results of operations of these entities prior to their acquisition dates are not included in the Company’s financial results for periods prior to their respective acquisition dates.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $38.2 million, an increase of 6.0% from $36.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in net interest income was primarily attributable to the one month of net interest income contributed by Alpine Bank.\nThe Company’s net interest income benefits from accretion income associated with purchased loan portfolios. Accretion income totaled $2.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $2.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nRelative to the first quarter of 2017, net interest income increased $10.7 million, or 39.1%. Accretion income for the first quarter of 2017 was $2.7 million. The increase in net interest income resulted from a $14.7 million increase in interest income on interest-earning assets, offset in part by a $3.9 million increase in interest expense. These increases were due to the full quarter impact of Centrue Bank, the one month impact of Alpine Bank, as well as organic growth.\nNet Interest Margin\nNet interest margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 3.69%, compared to 3.73% for the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company’s net interest margin benefits from accretion income on purchased loan portfolios, which contributed 16 and 26 basis points to net interest margin in the first quarter of 2018 and fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. Excluding the impact of accretion income, net interest margin was positively impacted by loan yields increasing more than funding costs, combined with an enhanced earning asset mix.\nRelative to the first quarter of 2017, the net interest margin decreased from 3.87%. Accretion income on purchased loan portfolios contributed 35 basis points to net interest margin in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding the impact of accretion income, the net interest margin was relatively unchanged.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $16.6 million, an increase of 18.6% from $14.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to one month of noninterest income contributed by Alpine Bank.\nWealth management revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $4.2 million, an increase of 16.6% from $3.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the one month contribution of Alpine Bank’s wealth management business, which added $1.1 billion in assets under administration. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, wealth management revenue increased 45.6%, which was attributable to 10% organic growth in assets under administration, the acquisition of CedarPoint in March 2017, and the addition of Alpine Bank’s wealth management business at the end of February 2018.\nCommercial FHA revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $3.3 million, an increase of 6.5% from $3.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company originated $80.4 million in rate lock commitments during the first quarter of 2018, compared to $98.5 million in the prior quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, commercial FHA revenue decreased 50.3%.\nResidential mortgage banking revenue for the first quarter of 2018 was $1.4 million, a decrease of 8.9% from $1.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, residential mortgage banking revenue decreased 51.4%, primarily due to a smaller loan production team.\nRelative to the first quarter of 2017, noninterest income increased 1.6% from $16.3 million. The increase was primarily due to greater wealth management and core banking fees, partially offset by lower commercial FHA and residential mortgage banking revenue.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $49.6 million, compared with $36.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. Noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 included $11.9 million of integration and acquisition expenses, while noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 included $2.7 million in integration and acquisition expenses and $0.4 million in losses on MSRs held-for-sale. Excluding these expenses, noninterest expense increased $4.7 million, or 14.1%, from the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to one month of expenses associated with the addition of Alpine Bank’s operations, combined with increased expenses from the expansion of the equipment financing business, as well as increased payroll taxes.\nRelative to the first quarter of 2017, noninterest expense, excluding integration and acquisition expenses, increased 27.7% from $29.5 million. The increase was primarily due to the addition of personnel and facilities from the three acquisitions completed over the past year.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense was $1.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $5.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, which included $4.5 million of additional tax expense related to the revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax assets.\nIncome tax expense for the first quarter of 2018 reflects the impact of the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was signed into law in December 2017; however, the Company recorded $0.7 million of additional state tax expense related to the revaluation of the Company’s state deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of the Alpine acquisition.\nLoan Portfolio\nTotal loans outstanding were $4.03 billion at March 31, 2018, compared with $3.23 billion at December 31, 2017 and $2.45 billion at March 31, 2017. The increase in total loans from December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the addition of Alpine’s loan portfolio. The increase in total loans from March 31, 2017 was due to 4.2% organic growth and the addition of the Alpine and Centrue loan portfolios.\nDeposits\nTotal deposits were $4.23 billion at March 31, 2018, compared with $3.13 billion at December 31, 2017, and $2.53 billion at March 31, 2017. The increase in total deposits from December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the addition of Alpine’s deposits. The increase in total deposits from March 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to the addition of Alpine’s and Centrue’s deposits.\nAsset Quality\nNon-performing loans totaled $26.5 million, or 0.66% of total loans, at March 31, 2018, compared with $26.8 million, or 0.83% of total loans, at December 31, 2017, and $28.9 million, or 1.18% of total loans, at March 31, 2017. The decrease in non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans at March 31, 2018 compared to the end of the prior quarter was due to the addition of the Alpine loan portfolio.\nNet charge-offs for the first quarter of 2018 were $0.7 million, or 0.09% of average loans on an annualized basis.\nThe Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $2.0 million for the first quarter of 2018. The Company’s allowance for loan losses was 0.44% of total loans and 66.8% of non-performing loans at March 31, 2018, compared with 0.51% of total loans and 61.4% of non-performing loans at December 31, 2017. Fair market value discounts recorded in connection with acquired loan portfolios represented 0.65% of total loans at March 31, 2018, compared with 0.51% of total loans at December 31, 2017.\nCapital\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company exceeded all regulatory capital requirements under Basel III and was considered to be a ‘‘well-capitalized’’ financial institution, as summarized in the following table:\nMarch 31, 2018 Well Capitalized\nRegulatory Requirements Total capital to risk-weighted assets 12.37% 10.00% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets 9.84% 8.00% Tier 1 leverage ratio 9.55% 5.00% Common equity Tier 1 capital 8.30% 6.50% Tangible common equity to tangible assets 6.89% NA Conference Call, Webcast and Slide Presentation\nThe Company will host a conference call and webcast at 7:30 a.m. Central Time on Friday, April 27, 2018 to discuss its financial results.
