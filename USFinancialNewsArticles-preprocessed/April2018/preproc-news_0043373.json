    "text": "LONG ISLAND CITY, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Steve Madden (NASDAQ:SHOO), a leading designer and marketer of fashion footwear and accessories for women, men and children, today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nAmounts referred to as “Adjusted” exclude the items that are described under the heading “Non-GAAP Adjustments.”\nFor the First Quarter 2018:\nNet sales increased 6.2% to $389.0 million compared to $366.4 million in the same period of 2017. Gross margin was 36.2%. Gross margin in the first quarter of 2017 was 36.2%. Adjusted gross margin in the first quarter of 2017 was 36.6%. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 27.7% compared to 28.9% of sales in the same period of 2017. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of sales were 26.9% compared to 26.8% in the same period of 2017. Operating income totaled $36.6 million, or 9.4% of net sales, compared to $30.8 million, or 8.4% of net sales, in the same period of 2017. Adjusted operating income was $39.6 million, or 10.2% of net sales, compared to Adjusted operating income of $39.5 million, or 10.8% of net sales, in the same period of 2017. Net income was $28.7 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, compared to $20.2 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, in the prior year's first quarter. Adjusted net income was $31.0 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, compared to $27.5 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, in the prior year's first quarter.\nEdward Rosenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are off to a good start in 2018, with first quarter results that exceeded our expectations. Our on-trend product assortments and speed-to-market capability continue to set us apart from the competition. We are particularly pleased with the strong growth we saw in international markets in the first quarter, as the investments we have made in our flagship Steve Madden brand and our international infrastructure bear fruit. As we look ahead, we are confident that, based on the power of our brands and the strength of our business model, we are well-positioned to drive sales and earnings growth in 2018 and beyond.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Segment Results\nNet sales for the wholesale business increased 5.8% to $331.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, with strong gains in both the wholesale footwear and wholesale accessories businesses. Gross margin in the wholesale business was 32.6%. Gross margin in the wholesale business in last year’s first quarter was 32.4%. Adjusted gross margin in the wholesale business in last year’s first quarter was 32.8%. The modest decline in wholesale gross margin compared to the prior year’s first quarter Adjusted gross margin was the result of strong growth in the Company’s private label business, which carries a lower gross margin.\nRetail net sales in the first quarter increased 8.6% to $57.9 million compared to $53.3 million in the first quarter of the prior year. Same store sales decreased 1.2% in the quarter as the result of a decline in the boot category. Retail gross margin decreased to 56.7% in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to 58.7% in the first quarter of the prior year due primarily to deep discounting of slow-selling inventory in the boot category.\nDuring the first quarter, the Company opened two stores and closed five stores in the United States. The Company also opened one store in Mexico and one store in China. The Company ended the quarter with 207 company-operated retail locations, including six Internet stores. In addition, during the first quarter, the Company opened two concessions in China and ended the quarter with 40 company-operated concessions in international markets.\nThe Company’s effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 21.4% compared to 34.8% in the first quarter of 2017. On an Adjusted basis, the effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 was 21.7% compared to 30.7% in the prior year period. The reduction in the Company’s effective tax rate compared to the prior year was primarily a result of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased 566,516 shares of the Company’s common stock for approximately $25.7 million, which includes shares acquired through the net settlement of employee stock awards.\nAs of March 31, 2018, cash, cash equivalents, and current and non-current marketable securities totaled $200.6 million.\nRegular Dividend\nThe Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share. The dividend will be paid on June 29, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 12, 2018.\nCompany Outlook\nFor fiscal year 2018, the Company continues to expect net sales will increase 5% to 7% over net sales in 2017. The Company expects diluted EPS for fiscal year 2018 will be in the range of $2.55 to $2.62. The Company expects Adjusted diluted EPS for fiscal year 2018 will be in the range of $2.60 to $2.67.\nNon-GAAP Adjustments\nAmounts referred to as “Adjusted” exclude the items below.\nFor the first quarter 2018:\n$2.8 million pre-tax ($2.1 million after-tax) expense in connection with a provision for legal charges, included in operating expenses. $0.3 million pre-tax ($0.2 million after-tax) expense in connection with the integration of the Schwartz & Benjamin acquisition and the related restructuring, included in operating expenses.\nFor the first quarter 2017:\n$1.2 million pre-tax ($0.8 million after-tax) in non-cash expense associated with the purchase accounting fair value adjustment of inventory acquired in the Schwartz & Benjamin acquisition, included in cost of sales. $7.5 million pre-tax ($6.5 million after-tax) in estimated bad debt expense associated with the Payless ShoeSource bankruptcy, included in operating expenses.\nFor the fiscal year 2018:\n$2.8 million pre-tax ($2.1 million after-tax) expense in connection with a provision for legal charges, included in operating expenses. $1.3 million pre-tax ($1.0 million after-tax) expense in connection with the integration of the Schwartz & Benjamin acquisition and the related restructuring, included in operating expenses.\nReconciliations of amounts on a GAAP basis to Adjusted amounts are presented in the Non-GAAP Reconciliation tables at the end of this release and identify and quantify all excluded items.\nConference Call Information\nInterested stockholders are invited to listen to the first quarter earnings conference call scheduled for today, April 20, 2018, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.
