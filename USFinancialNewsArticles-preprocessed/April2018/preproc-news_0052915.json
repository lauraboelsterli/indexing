    "text": "15 COMMENTS WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump said “three or four days” and as many as five locations are being considered for his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which is expected to occur by mid-June.\n“We have a decision to be made,” Mr. Trump said Thursday on Fox News. “That will all be narrowed down.”\nMr. Trump also disclosed new details about the trip Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo made to North Korea in recent weeks, saying Mr. Pompeo’s meeting with Mr. Kim was a surprise.\nMr. Pompeo “wasn’t supposed to meet” with Mr. Kim, the president said. That secret meeting was arranged “while he was there,” Mr. Trump added.\nThe meeting between Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Kim lasted “more than an hour,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Pompeo also met with North Korean intelligence officers while he was in the country, the president said.\nMr. Trump has said he wants to meet with Mr. Kim about the country’s nuclear weapons program. The president will urge North Korea to act quickly to dismantle its nuclear arsenal , and isn’t willing to grant Pyongyang substantial sanctions relief in return for a freeze of its nuclear and missile tests, administration officials have said.\nA meeting between President Donald Trump and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un could be a diplomatic breakthrough, but both men are nothing if not unpredictable.",
