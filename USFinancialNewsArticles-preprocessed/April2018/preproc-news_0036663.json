REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch “We want to achieve capital market readiness in the next 12 months. An IPO is just one of the options,” Renschler explained to journalists in Munich.\n“You can also go to the capital market without (an IPO). You can refinance yourself by issuing a bond.”\nReporting by Andreas Cremer; Writing by Edward Taylor; Editing by Arno Schuetze\n ",
