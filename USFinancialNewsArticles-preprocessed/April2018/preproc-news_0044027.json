Earnings grew by 23 percent, excluding the impact of a lower tax rate and our continued capital return through buybacks, each of which contributed approximately 5 percent.

Net interest revenue increased 16% driven by higher interest rates and higher deposits. Noninterest expense increased 4% reflecting the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, higher staff expense and volume-related sub-custodian and clearing expenses, partially offset by lower consulting expense. Effective tax rate of 19.5% reflecting a lower federal statutory tax rate.\nAssets under custody and/or administration (\"AUC/A\") and Assets under management (\"AUM\")\nRecord assets under custody and/or administration of $33.5 trillion, up 9%, reflecting higher market values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar and net new business. Assets under management of $1.9 trillion increased 8% reflecting the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar (principally versus the British Pound), higher market values and net inflows, partially offset by the divestiture of CenterSquare Investment Management (\"CenterSquare\") and other changes.\nCapital and liquidity\nRepurchased 11 million common shares for $644 million and paid $246 million in dividends to common shareholders. Return on common equity of 12%; Return on tangible common equity of 26% (b). Common equity Tier 1 (\"CET1\") ratio – 10.7%. Supplementary leverage ratio (\"SLR\") – 5.9%.

Net interest revenue increased in most businesses primarily driven by higher interest rates. The other drivers of net interest revenue and fee revenue by line of business are indicated below. Asset Servicing - Both increases primarily reflect higher net interest revenue due in part to an increase in deposit balances, higher fees driven by an increase in volumes, market values and foreign exchange volumes, as well as the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. Pershing - Both increases primarily reflect higher net interest revenue and higher fees due to growth in long-term mutual fund balances and clearance volumes. Issuer Services - The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher net interest revenue in Corporate Trust as well as the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. The sequential increase primarily reflects seasonally higher Depositary Receipts revenue. Treasury Services - The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher net interest revenue and payment volumes. Clearance and Collateral Management - The year-over-year increase primarily reflects growth in collateral management, higher clearance volumes and net interest revenue. Both noninterest expense comparisons reflect higher technology costs, the unfavorable impact of the weaker U.S. dollar and higher volume-related sub-custodian and clearing expense. The year-over-year increase was partially offset by lower consulting expenses. The sequential decrease is primarily due to lower severance, litigation and an asset impairment recorded in 4Q17.\nINVESTMENT MANAGEMENT BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS\n(dollars in millions, unless otherwise noted; not meaningful - N/M)\n1Q18 vs.\n1Q18\n4Q17\n1Q17\n4Q17\n1Q17\nTotal revenue by line of business: (a)\nAsset Management\n$\n770\n$\n738\n$\n661\n4\n%\n16\n%\nWealth Management\n318\n310\n302\n3\n5\nTotal revenue by line of business\n1,088\n1,048\n963\n4\n13\nProvision for credit losses\n2\n1\n3\nN/M\nN/M\nNoninterest expense\n705\n771\n683\n(9)\n3\nIncome before taxes\n$\n381\n$\n276\n$\n277\n38\n%\n38\n%\nPre-tax operating margin\n35\n%\n26\n%\n29\n%\nAdjusted pre-tax operating margin – Non-GAAP (b)\n39\n%\n29\n%\n32\n%\nMetrics:\nAverage loans\n$\n16,876\n$\n16,813\n$\n16,153\n—\n%\n4\n%\nAverage deposits\n$\n13,363\n$\n11,633\n$\n15,781\n15\n%\n(15)\n%\nWealth Management client assets (in billions) (current period is preliminary) (c)\n$\n246\n$\n251\n$\n236\n(2)\n%\n4\n%\nChanges in AUM (in billions) (current period is preliminary) : (d)\nBeginning balance of AUM\n$\n1,893\n$\n1,824\n$\n1,648\nNet inflows (outflows):\nLong-term strategies:\nEquity\n—\n(6)\n(4)\nFixed income\n7\n(2)\n2\nLiability-driven investments, including currency overlay\n13\n23\n14\nMulti-asset and alternative investments\n(3)\n2\n2\nTotal long-term active strategies inflows\n17\n17\n14\nIndex\n(13)\n(1)\n—\nTotal long-term strategies inflows\n4\n16\n14\nShort term strategies:\nCash\n(14)\n(4)\n13\nTotal net (outflows) inflows\n(10)\n12\n27\nNet market impact\n(14)\n47\n41\nNet currency impact\n29\n10\n11\nDivestiture/Other (e)\n(30)\n—\n—\nEnding balance of AUM\n$\n1,868\n$\n1,893\n$\n1,727\n(1)\n%\n8\n%\n(a)\nSee \"Change in Presentation\" on page 13 for additional information on the Investment Management business.\n(b)\nNet of distribution and servicing expense.

Asset Management - Both increases primarily reflect higher equity market values, the favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar (principally versus the British Pound) and the impact of the sale of CenterSquare. The year-over-year increase also reflects higher performance fees due primarily to strong liability driven investment and alternative investment performance. Wealth Management - Both increases primarily reflect higher equity market values. The year-over-year increase also reflects net new business, partially offset by lower net interest revenue due to lower deposit balances. Total noninterest expense increased year-over-year, primarily reflecting the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar. The sequential decrease primarily reflects lower severance and incentive expense.\nOTHER SEGMENT primarily includes leasing operations, certain corporate treasury activities, derivatives, business exits and other corporate revenue and expense items.\n(in millions)\n1Q18\n4Q17\n1Q17\nFee revenue\n$\n57\n$\n(221)\n$\n62\nNet securities (losses) gains\n(49)\n(26)\n10\nTotal fee and other revenue (loss)\n8\n(247)\n72\nNet interest (expense)\n(1)\n(36)\n(1)\nTotal revenue (loss)\n7\n(283)\n71\nProvision for credit losses\n—\n(5)\n(8)\nNoninterest expense\n87\n135\n107\n(Loss) before taxes\n$\n(80)\n$\n(413)\n$\n(28)\nKEY DRIVERS\nFee revenue increased sequentially primarily reflecting the impact of U.S. tax legislation on our investments in renewable energy, which resulted in a reduction of $279 million recorded in 4Q17.\nNet securities losses recorded in 1Q18 primarily relate to the sale of approximately $1 billion of debt securities.\nNet interest expense decreased sequentially primarily reflecting the impact of interest rate hedging activities.\nNoninterest expense decreased year-over-year and sequentially, primarily reflecting lower professional, legal and other purchased services expense, partially offset by higher incentive expense. The sequential decrease also reflects lower severance, software and occupancy expenses.\nCAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY\nOur consolidated capital and liquidity ratios are shown in the following table.\nCapital and liquidity ratios\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDec. 31,\n2017\nConsolidated regulatory capital ratios: (a)(b)\nCET1 ratio\n10.7\n%\n10.3\n%\nTier 1 capital ratio\n12.7\n12.3\nTotal capital ratio\n13.5\n13.0\nTier 1 leverage ratio\n6.5\n6.4\nSLR\n5.9\n5.9\nBNY Mellon shareholders' equity to total assets ratio\n11.2\n11.1\nBNY Mellon common shareholders' equity to total assets ratio\n10.2\n10.1\nAverage liquidity coverage ratio (\"LCR\")\n116\n%\n118\n%\nBook value per common share (c)\n$\n37.78\n$\n37.21\nTangible book value per common share – Non-GAAP (c)\n$\n18.78\n$\n18.24\nCash dividends per common share\n$\n0.24\n$\n0.24\nCommon dividend payout ratio\n22\n%\n22\n%\nClosing stock price per common share\n$\n51.53\n$\n53.86\nMarket capitalization (in millions)\n$\n52,080\n$\n54,584\nCommon shares outstanding (in thousands)\n1,010,676\n1,013,442\n(a)\nRegulatory capital ratios for March 31, 2018 are preliminary.

On a\ntransitional basis at Dec. 31, 2017, the CET1 ratio was 10.7%, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.7%,\nthe Total capital ratio was 13.4%, the Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.6% and the SLR was 6.1%.\n(c)\nTangible book value per common share – Non-GAAP excludes goodwill and intangible assets,\nnet of deferred tax liabilities.

The increase primarily reflects capital generated through earnings and additional paid-in capital resulting from stock awards, partially offset by capital deployed through common stock repurchased and dividends paid.\nNET INTEREST REVENUE\nNet interest revenue\n1Q18 vs.\n(dollars in millions; not meaningful - N/M)\n1Q18\n4Q17\n1Q17\n4Q17\n1Q17\nNet interest revenue\n$\n919\n$\n851\n$\n792\n8\n%\n16\n%\nAdd: Tax equivalent adjustment\n6\n11\n12\nN/M\nN/M\nNet interest revenue, on a fully taxable equivalent (\"FTE\") basis – Non-GAAP (a)\n$\n925\n$\n862\n$\n804\n7\n%\n15\n%\nNet interest margin\n1.22\n%\n1.14\n%\n1.13\n%\n8\nbps\n9\nbps\nNet interest margin (FTE) – Non-GAAP (a)\n1.23\n%\n1.16\n%\n1.14\n%\n7\nbps\n9\nbps\nSelected average balances:\nCash/interbank investments\n$\n120,821\n$\n117,446\n$\n106,069\n3\n%\n14\n%\nTrading account securities\n4,183\n2,723\n2,254\n54\n86\nSecurities\n118,459\n120,225\n114,786\n(1)\n3\nLoans\n58,606\n56,772\n60,312\n3\n(3)\nInterest-earning assets\n302,069\n297,166\n283,421\n2\n7\nInterest-bearing deposits\n155,704\n147,763\n139,820\n5\n11\nFederal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements\n18,963\n20,211\n18,995\n(6)\n—\nLong-term debt\n28,407\n28,245\n25,882\n1\n10\nOther interest-bearing liabilities\n23,920\n26,086\n22,855\n(8)\n5\nInterest-bearing liabilities\n226,994\n222,305\n207,552\n2\n9\nNoninterest-bearing deposits\n71,005\n69,111\n73,555\n3\n(3)\nSelected average yields/rates: (b)\nCash/interbank investments\n1.13\n%\n0.98\n%\n0.56\n%\nTrading account securities\n2.62\n2.02\n3.12\nSecurities\n2.03\n1.85\n1.71\nLoans\n2.90\n2.60\n2.15\nInterest-earning assets\n1.85\n1.65\n1.38\nInterest-bearing deposits\n0.30\n0.17\n0.03\nFederal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements\n2.29\n1.83\n0.51\nLong-term debt\n2.49\n2.29\n1.85\nOther interest-bearing liabilities\n1.04\n0.71\n0.28\nInterest-bearing liabilities\n0.82\n0.65\n0.33\nAverage cash/interbank investments as a percentage of average interest-earning assets\n40\n%\n40\n%\n37\n%\nAverage noninterest-bearing deposits as a percentage of average interest-earning assets\n24\n%\n23\n%\n26\n%\n(a)\nNet interest revenue (FTE) – Non-GAAP and net interest margin (FTE) – Non-GAAP include the tax equivalent adjustments on tax-exempt income which allows for\ncomparisons of amounts arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practice.

As a result, staff expense increased and\nother expense decreased. Prior periods have been reclassified.\n(b)\nBeginning in 1Q18, clearing expense, which was previously included in other expense, was included\nwith sub-custodian expense. Prior periods have been reclassified.\n(c)\nBeginning in 1Q18, merger and integration (\"M&I\"), litigation and restructuring charges are no longer\nseparately disclosed. Expenses previously reported in this line have been reclassified to existing\nexpense categories, primarily other expense.\nKEY DRIVERS\nThe year-over-year increase primarily reflects the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar, higher staff expense driven by the annual merit increase that was effective in July 2017 and higher performance-based incentives. The-year-over-year increase also reflects higher volume-related sub-custodian and clearing expenses, which were partially offset by lower consulting expense.\nThe sequential decrease reflects lower expenses in nearly all categories. The decrease primarily reflects severance, litigation and an asset impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by higher incentives due to the impact of vesting of long-term stock awards for retirement eligible employees and the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar.\nTHE BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON CORPORATION\nCondensed Consolidated Income Statement\nQuarter ended\n(in millions)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDec. 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\nFee and other revenue\nInvestment services fees:\nAsset servicing\n$\n1,168\n$\n1,130\n$\n1,063\nClearing services\n414\n400\n376\nIssuer services\n260\n197\n251\nTreasury services\n138\n137\n139\nTotal investment services fees\n1,980\n1,864\n1,829\nInvestment management and performance fees\n960\n962\n842\nForeign exchange and other trading revenue\n209\n166\n164\nFinancing-related fees\n52\n54\n55\nDistribution and servicing\n36\n38\n41\nInvestment and other income (loss)\n82\n(198)\n77\nTotal fee revenue\n3,319\n2,886\n3,008\nNet securities (losses) gains\n(49)\n(26)\n10\nTotal fee and other revenue\n3,270\n2,860\n3,018\nOperations of consolidated investment management funds\nInvestment (loss) income\n(11)\n17\n37\nInterest of investment management fund note holders\n—\n—\n4\n(Loss) income from consolidated investment management funds\n(11)\n17\n33\nNet interest revenue\nInterest revenue\n1,381\n1,219\n960\nInterest expense\n462\n368\n168\nNet interest revenue\n919\n851\n792\nTotal revenue\n4,178\n3,728\n3,843\nProvision for credit losses\n(5)\n(6)\n(5)\nNoninterest expense\nStaff (a)\n1,576\n1,628\n1,488\nProfessional, legal and other purchased services\n291\n339\n313\nSoftware and equipment\n234\n297\n223\nNet occupancy\n139\n153\n136\nSub-custodian and clearing (b)\n119\n102\n103\nDistribution and servicing\n106\n106\n100\nBank assessment charges\n52\n53\n57\nBusiness development\n51\n66\n51\nAmortization of intangible assets\n49\n52\n52\nOther (a)(b)(c)\n122\n210\n119\nTotal noninterest expense\n2,739\n3,006\n2,642\nIncome\nIncome before income taxes\n1,444\n728\n1,206\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes\n282\n(453)\n269\nNet income\n1,162\n1,181\n937\nNet loss (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests (includes $11, $(9) and $(18) related to consolidated\ninvestment management funds, respectively)\n9\n(6)\n(15)\nNet income applicable to shareholders of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n1,171\n1,175\n922\nPreferred stock dividends\n(36)\n(49)\n(42)\nNet income applicable to common shareholders of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation\n$\n1,135\n$\n1,126\n$\n880\n(a)\nIn 1Q18, we adopted new accounting guidance included in ASU 2017-07, Compensation-Retirement Benefits - Improving the\nPresentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which required the reclassification\nof the components of pension and other post-retirement costs, other than the service cost component.

Tangible common shareholders' equity excludes goodwill and intangible assets, net of deferred tax liabilities. BNY Mellon believes that the return on tangible common equity measure is an additional useful measure for investors because it presents a measure of those assets that can generate income. BNY Mellon has provided a measure of tangible book value per common share, which it believes provides additional useful information as to the level of tangible assets in relation to shares of common stock outstanding.\nBNY Mellon has presented the operating margin for the Investment Management business net of distribution and servicing expense that is passed to third parties who distribute or service our managed funds. BNY Mellon believes that this measure is useful when evaluating the business's performance relative to industry competitors.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of the return on common equity and tangible common equity.\nReturn on common equity and tangible common equity reconciliation\n(dollars in millions)\n1Q18\n4Q17\n1Q17\nNet income applicable to common shareholders of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation – GAAP\n$\n1,135\n$\n1,126\n$\n880\nAdd: Amortization of intangible assets\n49\n52\n52\nLess: Tax impact of amortization of intangible assets\n12\n18\n18\nAdjusted net income applicable to common shareholders of The Bank of New York Mellon\nCorporation, excluding amortization of intangible assets – Non-GAAP\n$\n1,172\n$\n1,160\n$\n914\nAverage common shareholders' equity\n$\n37,593\n$\n36,952\n$\n34,965\nLess: Average goodwill\n17,581\n17,518\n17,338\nAverage intangible assets\n3,397\n3,437\n3,578\nAdd: Deferred tax liability – tax deductible goodwill (a)\n1,042\n1,034\n1,518\nDeferred tax liability – intangible assets (a)\n716\n718\n1,100\nAverage tangible common shareholders' equity – Non-GAAP\n$\n18,373\n$\n17,749\n$\n16,667\nReturn on common equity (annualized) – GAAP\n12.2\n%\n12.1\n%\n10.2\n%\nReturn on tangible common equity (annualized) – Non-GAAP\n25.9\n%\n25.9\n%\n22.2\n%\n(a) Deferred tax liabilities, for the prior periods, are based on fully phased-in U.S. capital rules.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of the book value and tangible book value per common share.\nBook value and tangible book value per common share reconciliation\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nMarch 31,\n(dollars in millions except common shares)\n2018\n2017\n2017\nBNY Mellon shareholders' equity at period end – GAAP\n$\n41,728\n$\n41,251\n$\n39,138\nLess: Preferred stock\n3,542\n3,542\n3,542\nBNY Mellon common shareholders' equity at period end – GAAP\n38,186\n37,709\n35,596\nLess: Goodwill\n17,596\n17,564\n17,355\nIntangible assets\n3,370\n3,411\n3,549\nAdd: Deferred tax liability – tax deductible goodwill (a)\n1,042\n1,034\n1,518\nDeferred tax liability – intangible assets (a)\n716\n718\n1,100\nBNY Mellon tangible common shareholders' equity at period end – Non-GAAP\n$\n18,978\n$\n18,486\n$\n17,310\nPeriod-end common shares outstanding (in thousands)\n1,010,676\n1,013,442\n1,039,877\nBook value per common share – GAAP\n$\n37.78\n$\n37.21\n$\n34.23\nTangible book value per common share – Non-GAAP\n$\n18.78\n$\n18.24\n$\n16.65\n(a) Deferred tax liabilities, for the prior periods, are based on fully phased-in U.S. capital rules.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of the pre-tax operating margin for the Investment Management business.\nPre-tax operating margin reconciliation - Investment Management business\n(dollars in millions)\n1Q18\n4Q17\n1Q17\nIncome before income taxes – GAAP\n$\n381\n$\n276\n$\n277\nTotal revenue – GAAP\n$\n1,088\n$\n1,048\n$\n963\nLess: Distribution and servicing expense\n110\n107\n101\nAdjusted total revenue, net of distribution and servicing expense – Non-GAAP\n$\n978\n$\n941\n$\n862\nPre-tax operating margin – GAAP (a)\n35\n%\n26\n%\n29\n%\nAdjusted pre-tax operating margin, net of distribution and servicing expense – Non-GAAP (a)\n39\n%\n29\n%\n32\n%\n(a) Income before taxes divided by total revenue.\nThe following table presents the impact of U.S. tax legislation and other charges recorded in 4Q17.\nAmounts included in 4Q17 results\n(dollars in millions except earnings per share)\nU.S. tax\nlegislation\nOther\ncharges\n(a)\nFee and other revenue\n$\n(279)\n$\n(37)\nIncome from consolidated investment management funds\n—\n—\nNet interest revenue\n(4)\n—\nTotal revenue\n(283)\n(37)\nProvision for credit losses\n—\n—\nTotal noninterest expense\n—\n282\nIncome before taxes\n(283)\n(319)\n(Benefit) provision for income taxes\n(710)\n(73)\nNet income\n$\n427\n$\n(246)\nDiluted earnings per common share\n$\n0.41\n$\n(0.24)\n(a) Other charges include severance, litigation, an asset impairment and investment securities losses related to the sale of certain securities.\nCHANGE IN PRESENTATION\nIn 1Q18, we began presenting total revenue for each of the primary lines of business in our two principal businesses.

M&I, litigation and restructuring charges are no longer separately disclosed on the income statement. Expenses previously reported in this line have been reclassified to existing expense categories, primarily other expense. The adjusted pre-tax operating margin (Non-GAAP) for the Investment Management business no longer excludes amortization of intangible assets and provision for credit losses.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT\nA number of statements (i) in this Earnings Release, (ii) in our presentations and (iii) in the responses to questions on our conference call discussing our quarterly results and other public events may contain \" \" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 including our capital plans, strategic priorities, financial goals, client experience, driving revenue growth, preliminary business metrics and statements regarding our aspirations, as well as our overall plans, strategies, goals, objectives, expectations, outlooks, estimates, intentions, targets, opportunities, focus and initiatives.
