    "text": "April 12, 2018 / 3:48 AM / Updated 14 minutes ago Takeda sounding out banks for loans to buy Shire - sources Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nTOKYO (Reuters) - Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd has sounded out creditors for loans, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said, as it moves closer to making a bid for London-listed rare disease specialist Shire that could top $40 billion (£28.2 billion). FILE PHOTO: Logos of Japanese Takeda Pharmaceutical Co are seen at an office building in Glattbrugg near Zurich March 7, 2012. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo \nTakeda, Japan’s largest drugmaker by sales, has sounded out creditors including its main bank Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, two sources said, declining to be identified as the matter was confidential. \nKyodo News reported earlier that Takeda, Japan’s top drugmaker, was looking for loans of several trillion yen (tens of billions of dollars) in total from multiple banks. \nAt around $40 billion, a successful bid would be the largest ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company and would propel Takeda, helmed by Frenchman Christophe Weber, into the top ranks of global drug makers. Slideshow (2 Images) \nTakeda said last month it was “at a preliminary and exploratory stage” of considering a bid. Under UK takeover rules, it has until April 25 to decide whether to make a bid. \nRepresentatives for Takeda, Shire and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, the core banking unit of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc, were not immediately available for comment. \nTakeda shares were down 0.8 percent in Tokyo trading. The company’s shares have fallen more than 9 percent since it was first reported they were considering bidding. Reporting by Sam Nussey and Taro Fuse; Editing by Chang-Ran Kim and Edwina Gibbs",
