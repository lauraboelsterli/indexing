(TSXV:FLGC) (OTCQB:FNNGF) is pleased to announce its first contest and promotional event, driven by social media influencers. This marketing model exposes customers to a proprietary influencer marketing network, which FanLogic is organically growing. This proprietary network will allow customers to use its wide range tools and outcomes to generate higher ROI in their own marketing campaigns. FanLogic believes it is now offering a unique value proposition to this rapidly growing multi-billion-dollar industry.\nBoth contests will promote sponsoring brands by offering contestants access to VIP prizes and experiences at the 2018 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, one of the largest, annual outdoor music festivals to be held in Coachella Valley, California April 13th to April 22nd. FanLogic will execute a second contest during the Governors Ball, to be held in New York City this June. Many of the biggest names in music and entertainment attend both events. FanLogic’s partner in this campaign, Rafael Luciano of My Time Entertainment, an experienced marketer in influencer marketing states, “Adding data collection to influencer marketing is a game changer by giving brands quantifiable leads from their influencer marketing initiatives. The tangible audience connection that transpires around these events is a prime example of brands utilizing influencers to endorse their products and messaging.”\n“This introduction to the influencer marketing world opens up an entirely new revenue stream for FanLogic,” said Randy Brownell, FanLogic CEO. “We are well positioned to capitalize on this industry with our current software platform and offerings.”\nInvited to participate in this exclusive event are select celebrities and influencers including Director X, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Graham, Jenna Frumes, Shay Mitchell, Justine Skye, Monique Coleman, Bre-Z, Chloe Grace Moretz, and more.
