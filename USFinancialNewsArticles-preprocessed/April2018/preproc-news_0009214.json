    "text": "FREMONT, Calif., April 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Aehr Test Systems (NASDAQ:AEHR) , a worldwide supplier of semiconductor test and burn-in equipment, today announced financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2018 ended February 28, 2018.\nFiscal Third Quarter Financial Results:\nNet sales were $7.4 million, up 176% from $2.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. GAAP net income was $267,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $2.7 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP net income, which excludes the impact of stock-based compensation expense, was $509,000, or $0.02 per diluted share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $2.4 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Backlog as of February 28, 2018 was $12.6 million, compared to $11.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nFiscal First Nine Months Financial Results:\nNet sales were $22.3 million, up 82% from $12.2 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. GAAP net income was $337,000, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $4.9 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP net income was $1.2 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared to a non-GAAP net loss of $4.1 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, in the first nine months of fiscal 2017.\nAn explanation of the use of non-GAAP financial information and a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in the accompanying tables.\nThird Quarter and Recent Business Highlights:\nAnnounced during the quarter the initial order totaling over $2 million from a new customer for its FOX-XP™ Test and Burn-in System to be used for singulated die test and burn-in of silicon photonics devices. Announced during the quarter a follow-on order from one of its lead customers for its FOX-XP Test and Burn-in System to provide additional wafer test capacity to meet the customer’s increasing silicon photonics device production requirements. Announced during the quarter orders exceeding $2.5 million for burn-in and test products and services for automotive semiconductor devices from a leading multinational manufacturer of advanced logic ICs for automotive applications. Announced during the quarter a new customer order for an ABTS™ system from a prominent United States government military and aerospace contractor for production burn-in and test of a wide variety of integrated circuits (ICs) designed and built by the contractor. Announced today a follow-on order for multiple ABTS systems totaling $1.5 million from a leading mobile wireless communications chipset company for production test and burn-in of devices used in an automotive application.\nGayn Erickson, President and CEO of Aehr Test Systems, commented:\n“There is a rising tide of concern in the automotive, mobile, and photonics markets, particularly focused on human safety and extended reliability testing and burning-in of devices, which Aehr Test is very well positioned to address. This is a key driver behind the strength and interest we continue to see from the semiconductor market for our new wafer level, singulated die, and packaged part test and burn-in solutions.\n“We are encouraged that the market potential for our new FOX-P family of products continues to gain traction both with new customers and for new applications. During the quarter, we announced orders for our FOX-XP wafer level and singulated die based system for test and burn-in of silicon photonics devices. These orders included a follow-on order from one of our lead customers for the FOX-XP system and also from an additional new customer for Aehr Test. We continue to see silicon photonics and optical communication as a great market opportunity for our solutions, where we provide customers with a highly valuable and unique alternative to test and burn-in their devices at the wafer or singulated die form rather than at a packaged or system level, where the cost of failures is substantially higher.\n“Aehr Test’s ABTS packaged part test and burn-in systems business continues at a healthy run rate with both system and upgrade orders from new customers and from our installed base. We added yet another new customer for our ABTS system during the quarter and also announced today a multi-system order from a current customer. This new order is for systems to ship to multiple new contract manufacturers to be used for production test and burn-in of automotive devices used in navigation systems. In addition, we shipped over 20 of our ABTS high performance thermal chambers during the quarter to our OEM customer for their high volume custom application.\n“We are beginning to see a strong consumables business emerge with our increasing installed base of FOX systems. Our proprietary WaferPak full wafer contactors and DiePak singulated die and module carriers are purchased for use with our previous generation of FOX-1 and FOX-15 systems as well as our new FOX-XP test and burn-in system. Customers purchase these contactors and carriers for each new device design in addition to incremental capacity needs of existing devices.\n“With more than $22 million in revenue for the first nine months and a quarter-end backlog of $12.6 million, we are confident with our previously provided revenue guidance for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2018 of full year total revenue growth of at least 50% over fiscal 2017 and we continue to expect to be profitable for the year. Also, with the strength and opportunities we are seeing with our wafer level, singulated die, and packaged part businesses, we are well positioned for continued growth heading into our fiscal year 2019 that starts in June.”\nManagement Conference Call and Webcast\nAehr Test Systems will host a conference call and webcast today at 5:00 p.m. Eastern (2:00 p.m. PT) to discuss its third quarter fiscal 2018 operating results.

Non-GAAP net income (loss) is a financial measure the Company uses to evaluate the underlying results and operating performance of the business. The limitation of this measure is that it excludes items that impact the Company's current period net income. This limitation is best addressed by using this measure in combination with net income (loss) (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure). These measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies.\nWe believe these measures enhance investors’ ability to review the company’s business from the same perspective as the company’s management and facilitate comparisons of this period’s results with prior periods.\nAEHR TEST SYSTEMS AND SUBSIDIARIES Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (in thousands, except per share data) (unaudited) February 28, November 30, May 31, 2018 2017 2017 ASSETS Current assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 9,077 $ 9,959 $ 17,803 Short-term investments 5,986 5,969 - Accounts receivable, net 4,673 3,490 4,010 Inventories 9,368 8,225 6,604 Prepaid expenses and other 1,339 2,098 961 Total current assets 30,443 29,741 29,378 Property and equipment, net 1,205 1,166 1,419 Other assets 324 94 95 Total assets $ 31,972 $ 31,001 $ 30,892 LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY Current liabilities: Accounts payable $ 2,638 $ 1,789 $ 2,808 Accrued expenses 1,643 1,607 1,609 Customer deposits and deferred revenue, short-term 2,310 3,142 3,467 Total current liabilities 6,591 6,538 7,884 Long-term debt 6,110 6,110 6,110 Deferred revenue, long-term 497 251 104 Total liabilities 13,198 12,899 14,098 Aehr Test Systems shareholders' equity 18,794 18,121 16,813 Noncontrolling interest (20 ) (19 ) (19 ) Total shareholders' equity 18,774 18,102 16,794 Total liabilities and shareholders' equity $ 31,972 $ 31,001 $ 30,892\nSource:Aehr Test Systems",
