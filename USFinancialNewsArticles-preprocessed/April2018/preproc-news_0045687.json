Consolidated earnings forecasts for 2018 (from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018)\nAmid rapid international and domestic changes, there is a level of uncertainty within the mobile applications market for smartphones and other mobile devices, the main business of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”). As the state of this market significantly impacts the Group’s financial results, it is difficult to formulate a precise earnings forecast. Furthermore, as the Company’s shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange as well as the Tokyo Stock Exchange, we are also carefully considering risks relating to U.S. securities regulations. Accordingly, an announcement concerning earnings forecasts is not made at this time.\nNotes\n(1) Changes in significant subsidiaries during the current period (changes in specified subsidiaries resulting in change in scope of consolidation): None (2) Changes in accounting policies and estimates a.
