    "text": "PARIS, April 25 (Reuters) - A French judge has indicted businessman Vincent Bollore in a corruption investigation related to his group’s businesses in two countries in Africa, the company said on Wednesday.\n“Vincent Bollore has been indicted by Judge (Serge) Tournaire,” Groupe Bollore said in a statement.\n“Bollore, who continues to be presumed innocent, will now have access to this dossier (of evidence) whose content he had no knowledge of and will have the opportunity to answer these unfounded accusations,” it added.\nThe decision to place the French tycoon under formal investigation over allegations his company undercharged for work on behalf of presidential candidates in Guinea and Togo in return for port contracts came after two days of questioning by police.
