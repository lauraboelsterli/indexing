    "text": "0 COMMENTS Lodging REIT Pebblebrook Hotel Trust PEB -0.50% on Tuesday said it has revised its bid for LaSalle Hotel Properties LHO -0.22% for the second and final time, boosting the price and the potential cash payout percentage amid talk of competition from other potential bidders.\nWith real-estate investment trusts trading at discounts to their net asset values and underperforming the S&P 500 for the third year running, analysts expect acquisition activity to ratchet up this year.\nPebblebrook, which owns 6,972 guest rooms across 28 hotels, revised its stock-for-stock bid for LaSalle, implying a merger price of $32.49 a share based on an exchange ratio of 0.9085 Pebblebrook share for each LaSalle share. LaSalle’s shareholders also can opt to receive cash for up to 20% of their shares, up from the earlier 15%, Pebblebrook said.\nThis is up from the initial all-stock bid at a value of $30.00 a share made on March 28, which LaSalle rejected, saying it undervalued the company.\nLaSalle, which owns approximately 10,400 rooms in 41 hotels, said its board of trustees will carefully review Pebblebrook’s revised proposal. LaSalle’s share price has risen 23% since March 27. Pebblebrook’s share price rose 5.1% over the same period.\n“Pebblebrook’s final offer strikes us as a full and attractive offer for LaSalle’s shareholders,” said Jeffrey Donnelly, senior analyst at Wells Fargo Securities. The revised bid “would likely only be bested by another party with a higher offer and a meaningfully larger cash component,” Mr. Donnelly said, adding that accelerating supply growth in the industry suggests the shares are fairly valued.\nIn an April 20 letter to LaSalle’s board highlighting the benefits of combining the two Bethesda, Md.-based hotel REITs, Pebblebrook said LaSalle might be evaluating other offers at lower prices and urged the company to hold back from entering any agreement that includes a breakup fee.\n“We continue to believe that there will be substantial long-term strategic benefits from combining our companies with significant potential value creation for LaSalle shareholders that would be unavailable in the case of an all-cash offer,” said Jon E. Bortz, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Pebblebrook.\nWrite to Esther Fung at esther.fung@wsj.com",
