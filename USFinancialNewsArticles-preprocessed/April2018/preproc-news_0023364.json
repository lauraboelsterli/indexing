    "text": "April 11 (Reuters) - The Singapore Exchange on Wednesday said it would list Indian equity derivative products in June, nearly two months after India’s three main bourses announced they would stop licensing their indexes to overseas exchanges.\nThe announcement comes after the Singapore bourse said it would launch successor products to its flagship Indian equity index derivatives before the bourse’s license agreement with the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) expires in August 2018.\nIn Wednesday’s statement, the Singapore exchange said it is continuing to evaluate a joint trading and clearing model in Gujarat International Finance Tech city between the NSE and SGX.\nReporting by Susan Mathew in Bengaluru; Editing by Shri Navaratnam\n ",
