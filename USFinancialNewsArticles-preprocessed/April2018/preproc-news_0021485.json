    "text": "WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif., April 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Guitar Center, Inc. (the “Company”) announced the expiration and final results of its previously announced exchange offer and consent solicitation (the “Exchange Offer”) to (i) exchange its existing 9.625% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2020, of which there are currently $325 million aggregate principal amount outstanding (the “Existing Notes”), for (a) 5% Cash/ 8% PIK Notes due 2022 (the “Exchange Notes”) and (b) warrants (the “Warrants” and, together with the Exchange Notes, the “New Securities”) to purchase shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Guitar Center Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and the direct parent of the Company (“Holdings”), and (ii) solicit consents to certain proposed amendments to the indenture governing the Existing Notes, commenced by the Company on March 12, 2018.\nThe Exchange Offer expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 11, 2018 (such time and date, the “Expiration Date”). As of the Expiration Date, according to information provided to the Company by KCC, LLC, the Information and Exchange Agent for the Exchange Offer, $317,957,000, or approximately 97.83%, of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Existing Notes had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn. No Existing Notes were validly tendered after the early tender date of March 23, 2018.\nIn addition, in the Exchange Offer, the Company received the consents from holders of the Existing Notes necessary to adopt the proposed amendments (the “Proposed Amendments”) to the indenture governing the Existing Notes set forth in the Company’s Amended and Restated Confidential Offering Memorandum and Consent Solicitation Statement dated March 21, 2018 (the “Offering Memorandum”). The Company expects to execute the supplemental indenture that gives effect to the Proposed Amendments, which will become operative upon the settlement of the Exchange Offer.\nThe Company expects the settlement of the Exchange Offer to take place on or about April 16, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nThe Amended Offering Memorandum was distributed only to holders of Existing Notes that completed and returned a letter of eligibility confirming that they are “eligible holders” for the purposes of the Exchange Offer.\nThe New Securities have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”) or the securities laws of any state and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the New Securities, nor shall there be any sale of the New Securities, in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.\nThe Company can provide no assurance that the settlement of the Exchange Offer will occur on the terms described in this press release, or at all.\nAbout Guitar Center\nGuitar Center is a leading retailer of musical instruments, lessons, repairs and rental instruments in the U.S. With more than 280 stores across the U.S. and one of the top direct sales websites in the industry, Guitar Center has helped people make music for more than 50 years.
