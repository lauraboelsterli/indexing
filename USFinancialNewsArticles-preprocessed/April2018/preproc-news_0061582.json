    "text": "Winston-Salem, NC, April 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Inmar today announced that Michele Lemmons, VP, Finance, has been named one of the Triad Business Journal’s 2018 Outstanding Women in Business.\nThe Outstanding Women in Business program honors women based upon their accomplishments in their industries and communities, including philanthropic leadership. Recipients were recognized during a luncheon April 27.\nMichele began her tenure with Inmar as a financial analyst in 1998 and has held positions of increasing responsibility; in 2016 she was named vice president. Throughout her career, she has demonstrated exceptional ability to design, implement and lead processes and technology innovation that drive efficiency, including large ERP system implementations and enhancements.\nAt the same time, she has also built a reputation as an excellent developer of people and teams. She regularly spends time mentoring members of her team and others within Inmar consistently displaying compassion and strong insight; she is forthright in her communications with staff, peers and management to drive open dialogue and constructive improvement in relationships and results.\n“Michele leads by example, always willing to go the extra mile and is passionate about not just delivering good results, but great results. She is a gifted problem solver and drives efficiency,” said Inmar Chairman and CEO David Mounts.\nMichele also joins with her church to be a strong supporter of outreach efforts, including Habitat for Humanity, the Forsyth County Backpack Program, Good Samaritans Ministries and community beautification projects. She also supports Hospice Services, saying, “I believe that when a loved one requires the type of care offered by Hospice, financial needs are the last thing a family needs to be worried about. The Hospice organization is compassionate and provides excellent care during difficult times. My family has personally experienced the care provided by this organization on multiple occasions, and I want to make sure other families receive that same type of care.”\n# # #\nABOUT INMAR\nAnyone who has redeemed a coupon, filled a prescription or returned a product, has touched Inmar.
