    "text": "April 22, 2018 / 1:54 AM / Updated 15 hours ago Rugby-Horne's career-ending injury shocks Australia Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nMELBOURNE, April 22 (Reuters) - Australian rugby was rocked on Sunday by news of a career-ending injury to Wallabies centre Rob Horne, with tributes flowing on social media from fans and fellow players. \nThe 28-year-old, who suffered several serious arm injuries at elite level, was forced to retire after sustaining nerve damage in his right arm when playing for Northampton Saints against Leicester Tigers in the English Premiership last week. \nHorne’s retirement was “absolutely tragic news”, Northampton interim head coach Alan Dickens said . \n“He is a hugely respected and popular member of the dressing room and this will be an enormous loss to Saints – both from a rugby and a personal perspective,” he added. \nA hard-running outside centre capped 34 times for Australia, Horne was leading try-scorer for the Saints with eight this season and led the team as stand-in captain for the first time against the Tigers. \nBefore crossing to the Saints, Horne enjoyed a successful 10-year stint with Sydney’s New South Wales Waratahs and was a member of the 2014 team that captured a maiden Super Rugby title under the guidance of Michael Cheika, the current Wallabies boss. \nHorne represented Australia at the 2011 and 2015 World Cups, and played against the British and Irish Lions in 2013. \nInjuries restricted his Wallabies appearances in recent seasons but he was recalled for the June test against Italy last year before crossing to England on a three-year deal with the Saints. \n“We are deeply saddened to hear of the immediate retirement of Wallaby # 838 and champion Waratah, Rob Horne due to injury,” Australia’s Rugby Union Players’ Association tweeted. \n“Rugby is fortunate to be a sport full of great men and women. Rob is and always will be one of the greatest. We wish him the very best recovery possible.” \nFormer England centre Brad Barritt was “shocked” by the news. \n“A terrific player and bloke,” the Saracens back tweeted. \n“Wishing you all the best with your recovery and for your next step in life. Congratulations on a fantastic career.” Reporting by Ian Ransom; Editing by Peter Rutherford",
