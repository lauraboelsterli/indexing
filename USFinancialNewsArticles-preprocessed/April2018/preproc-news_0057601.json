    "text": "April 22, 2018 / 5:20 PM / 5 days ago German shoppers sample burgers made of buffalo worms\nAACHEN, Germany (Reuters) - Supermarket shoppers in the western German city of Aachen have stepped out of their comfort zone to sample insect burgers made of buffalo worms.\nThe worms, highly nutritious due to their high protein content, are the larvae of buffalo beetles and are bred in the Netherlands.\nServed in rolls with lettuce, onions and tomatoes, they are being offered to customers at a supermarket in Aachen where they have just been added to the stock range after proving successful in the Netherlands and Belgium.\nOne passerby who tried one of the burgers, Manfred Roedder, said he believed they were a good alternative to meat, adding: “I had reservations at first but I got a second serving because it tasted so good.”\nBaris Oezel, one of the founders of the start-up called Bugfoundation that makes the burgers, said he spent four years working on the concept along with company co-founder Max Kraemer. Max Kraemer, a 32-year-old geographer of the start-up \"Bug Foundation\" bites into a hamburger made of Buffalo worms (Alphitobius Diaperinus), that he created together with a business economist, during its premiere in a supermarket in Aachen, Germany, April 20, 2018. REUTERS/Wolfgang Rattay\nThe pair got the idea after travelling together to southeast Asia, where it is not uncommon to eat insects.\n“It’s quite simple. You have to create an aesthetic product that looks good and doesn’t show any insects,” Oezel said, adding that people were attracted by the smell of the burgers.\nBut not everyone is sure about them.
