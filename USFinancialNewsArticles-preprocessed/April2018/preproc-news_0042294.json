    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde’s suggestion that euro zone leaders should set up a “rainy day fund” to help cushion member states in economic downturns is not a good idea, two senior German officials said on Friday.\n“I don’t think the proposal is convincing,” Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said, adding that setting up such a fund would distract euro zone leaders from pressing issues.\nGerman Finance Minister Olaf Scholz added: “I don’t think the proposal of the IMF chief is one that should be pursued.”\nReporting by Gernot Heller; Writing by Joseph Nasr; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ",
