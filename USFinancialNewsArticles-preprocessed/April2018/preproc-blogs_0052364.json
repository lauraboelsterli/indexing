The meeting comes amid an outcry over how technology companies collect and manage the personal data of their users.\n–The Senate resumes consideration of the nomination of Mike Pompeo to be secretary of state. He’s expected to receive confirmation.\n–French President Emmanuel Macron addresses a joint meeting of Congress at 11 a.m.\n Jamerson (@joshjame) on the situation at the VA:\nRear Adm. Ronny Jackson, President Donald Trump's choice to be secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, leaves a Senate office building April 24 after meeting individually with some members of the committee that would vet him for the post. Photo: J. Scott Applewhite/Associated Press\nToday was supposed to be the day Dr. Ronny Jackson came to the Senate for his confirmation hearing to be the next secretary of Veterans Affairs. Instead, those hearings are postponed indefinitely, and President Donald Trump has openly mused about whether his pick to lead the VA should even continue with the process. “I really don’t think, personally, he should do it,” the president said of Dr. Jackson yesterday, with French President Emmanuel Macron standing beside him at the White House.\nTurbulence at the top of the Department of Veterans Affairs dates back to its founding, at the tail end of the Reagan administration, which elevated the VA chief to cabinet rank in the late 1980s. Since then, there have been nine secretaries. Six of them have been fired or resigned in scandal and three have left on their own terms. One in the latter category was Bob McDonald . He was secretary before Mr. Trump appointed David Shulkin , who was ousted last month, to the post at the start of his term.\n“The frequent leadership turnover at VA hurts efforts to sustain excellence and that hurts veterans,” Mr. McDonald told me yesterday. The Obama appointee–who was previously CEO of Procter & Gamble, a former Army captain and a longtime Republican–said secretaries should come into the job with not only with experience in the armed services, but also managerial experience. “I think President Obama got it right when he looked for someone who had successfully run a large company,” he said.\nMr. McDonald declined to comment on Dr. Jackson’s nomination specifically, but three other past VA secretaries, all who served under President George W. Bush , recently penned a letter of support for him. That support was not enough to assuage concerns from many lawmakers, who, even before studying Dr. Jackson’s record, had raised concerns, saying the presidential physician’s record showed scant experience running a bureaucracy on the scale he would inherit.\nAnd there are fresh concerns. Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, the top Democrat on the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, in a CNN interview Tuesday night, laid out allegations he received that Dr. Jackson belittled lower-ranking employees, drank to excess on overseas trips, and handed out prescriptions “like candy,” walking down the aisle during flights doling out drugs to help people fall asleep and wake up. “In the White House, they call him the candy man,” Mr. Tester told CNN. Dr. Jackson will continue to seek confirmation and told the president the allegations weren’t true, Peter Nicholas , Louise Radnofsky and Siobhan Hughes report.\nJoe Chenelly , national executive director of Amvets, a veterans advocacy group, told me yesterday that he’s still looking forward to a hearing. “But if the allegations are true, maybe there’s no need for a hearing.” He added that if Dr. Jackson “isn’t all in, he better walk away because this is nasty, nasty stuff.” Dr. Jackson, appearing on Capitol Hill for meetings, said yesterday: “I’m looking forward to getting (a hearing) rescheduled and answering all the questions.”\nTrump, Macron Talk Iran and Break Bread\nThe administration has vowed to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear accord unless European allies agree to address administration concerns. Mr. Trump says the deal gives Iran too much in sanctions relief for too few curbs on its nuclear program. Yesterday at the White House, Mr. Macron said he sees the deal differently, but he noted that the two leaders both want to stem nuclear proliferation and stated his desire “to work as from now on a new deal.” American and European officials have been discussing ways to address Mr. Trump’s concerns ahead of a May 12 deadline Mr. Trump set for the U.S. to see its worries addressed or leave the pact.\nAt the first state dinner at the Trump White House, the menu featured greens from the garden planted by former first lady Michelle Obama , writes Michael C. Bender. Messrs. Trump and Macron toasted the Washington-Paris alliance at a formal occasion honoring the French president’s visit.\nMore from Washington:\nA decision issued overnight by U.S. District Judge John Bates , a George W. Bush appointee, is considered the broadest so far against the Trump administration’s move to end the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program. And: The high court upheld a new government process for challenging the validity of patents . The Supreme Court will hear arguments today challenging the Trump administration’s ban on travel from several Muslim-majority countries. The justice are expected to rule by the end of June.\nPresident Trump is caught between two powerful business constituents of the GOP as he faces growing pressure to resolve a dispute between the oil industry and the Farm Belt involving a requirement to blend ethanol into gasoline.\nDecision 2018: Republican Debbie Lesko won Tuesday’s special election for a House seat in Arizona, defeating Democrat Hiral Tipirneni in a heavily Republican district that the party spent more than $1 million to retain, Reid J. Epstein reports. Plus: Assemblywoman Shelley Mayer won a New York State Senate seat, giving Democrats a one-person majority in the state Senate and setting up a new battle for power in Albany .\nTrade update: Mr. Trump will send Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to Beijing next week to try to settle China trade disputes .\nThe Environmental Protection Agency plans to restrict research used in developing regulations, a change that could affect rules governing everything from household products to power-plant emissions.\nTwo senior Senate Democrats have asked a number of large banks to turn over information about accounts and assets controlled by a group of Russian elites who have been designated by the U.S. Treasury Department for possible sanctions. The letter was sent last week but reviewed by WSJ’s Byron Tau on Tuesday.\nNews and notes: Texas’ congressional and legislative maps appeared no closer to clarity following Supreme Court arguments that went into overtime in addressing claims of racial gerrymandering… James Comey ‘s new book hit No. 1 in its first week … and the Trump administration is likely to end public access to a web portal used by hundreds of thousands of consumers each year to file complaints against financial companies.\nFrom across WSJ:\nPart of North Korea’s underground nuclear test facility is unusable due to the collapse of a cavity inside the mountain after the latest test-detonation occurred, according to Chinese seismologists. Separately, a suspected North Korean cyberattack has expanded to a global data-theft campaign targeting nations including the U.S. and Australia.\nFacebook will deliver earnings results after the closing bell today. CEO Mark Zuckerberg will likely face more questions about how the company handles data and privacy.\nMilestone\n3%: The yield on the 10-year Treasury note hit 3% Tuesday for the first time since 2014.\nTweet of the Day\n@realDonaldTrump: Our two great republics [U.S. and France] are linked together by the timeless bonds of history, culture, and destiny. We are people who cherish our values, protect our civilization, and recognize the image of God in every human soul.\n Capital Journal Daybreak Donald Trump Emmanuel Macron France Ronny Jackson Veterans Affairs Previous Arizona Special Election: What to Watch Next VA Nominee Withdraws | Pruitt to Face Grilling | Travel Ban Poised to Survive",
