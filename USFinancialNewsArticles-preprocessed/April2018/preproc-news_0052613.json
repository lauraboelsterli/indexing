    "text": "BEIJING, Weibo Corporation (the \"Weibo\" or \"Company\") (NASDAQ: WB), China's leading social media platform, today announced that it filed its annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 26, 2018. The annual report can be accessed on Weibo's investor relations website at http://ir.weibo.com .

Requests should be directed to Investor Relations, Weibo Corporation, No.8 SINA Plaza, Courtyard 10, XiBeiWang, Haidian District, Beijing 100193, China.\nABOUT WEIBO CORPORATION\nWeibo is a leading social media for people to create, share and discover content online. It combines the means of public self-expression in real time with a powerful platform for social interaction, content aggregation and content distribution. Any user can create and post a feed and attach multi-media and long-form content. User relationships on Weibo may be asymmetric; any user can follow any other user and add comments to a feed while reposting. This simple, asymmetric and distributed nature of Weibo allows an original feed to become a live viral conversation stream.\nWeibo enables its advertising and marketing customers to promote their brands, products and services to users. Weibo offers a wide range of advertising and marketing solutions to companies of all sizes. The Company generates a substantial majority of its revenues from the sale of advertising and marketing services, including the sale of social display advertisement and promoted marketing offerings. Weibo has developed and is continuously refining its social interest graph recommendation engine, which enables its customers to perform people marketing and target audiences based on user demographics, social relationships, interests and behaviors, to achieve greater relevance, engagement and marketing effectiveness.\nContact:\nInvestor Relations\nWeibo Corporation\nTel: +86-10-5898-3017\nEmail: ir@staff.weibo.com\n releases/weibo-files-its-annual-report-on-form-20-f-300637150.html\nSOURCE Weibo Corporation",
