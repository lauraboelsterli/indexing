    "text": "HINGHAM, Mass., HINGHAM INSTITUTION FOR SAVINGS (NASDAQ:HIFS), Hingham, Massachusetts announced earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nNet income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $8,912,000 or $4.18 per share basic and $4.08 per share diluted, as compared to $6,112,000 or $2.87 per share basic and $2.80 per share diluted for the same period last year. For the first quarter of 2018, the Bank’s annualized return on average equity was 18.56% and the annualized return on average assets was 1.56%, as compared to 14.77% and 1.21%, respectively, for the same period in 2017. This represents a 46% increase in diluted earnings per share over the same period last year.\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Bank adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-01, Financial Instruments – Overall, (Subtopic 825-10), which requires changes in the unrealized gains on certain equity securities, net of deferred taxes, to be recognized through the income statement. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-01, these changes were recorded in stockholders’ equity through accumulated other comprehensive income, and only realized gains on sale of securities were recognized through the income statement. Excluding the after-tax gains on securities, both realized and unrealized, net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $8,159,000 or $3.83 per share basic and $3.73 per share diluted, representing a core return on average equity of 16.99% and a core return on average assets of 1.43%. This represents a 33% increase in diluted earnings per share over the same period last year.\nGrowth in the first quarter of 2018 was modest, as deposits increased to $1.532 billion at March 31, 2018, representing 7% annualized growth year-to-date and 9% growth from March 31, 2017. Net loans increased to $1.872 billion, representing 8% annualized growth year-to-date and 15% growth from March 31, 2017. Total assets decreased to $2.240 billion, representing a 2% decline from December 31, 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, the Bank used a portion of its cash balances to reduce outstanding Federal Home Loan Bank advances and listing services time deposits, in order to minimize the carrying cost of its on-balance sheet liquidity. Total assets have increased 10% from March 31, 2017. Book value per share was $91.14 as of March 31, 2018, representing 18% annualized growth year-to-date and 16% growth from March 31, 2017. In addition to the increase in book value per share, the Bank declared $1.68 in dividends per share since March 31, 2017, including a special dividend of $0.34 per share declared during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nKey credit and operational metrics remained strong in the first quarter. At March 31, 2018, non-performing assets totaled 0.08% of total assets, compared to 0.07% at December 31, 2017 and 0.09% at March 31, 2017. Non-performing loans as a percentage of the total loan portfolio totaled 0.10% at March 31, 2018, compared to 0.09% at December 31, 2017 and 0.08% at March 31, 2017. The Bank recorded $1,000 of net recoveries for the first three months of 2018, as compared to zero net charge-offs for the same period last year. At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Bank did not own any foreclosed property and at March 31, 2017, the Bank owned only one piece of foreclosed property valued at $563,000. The efficiency ratio improved to 30.41% for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to 32.45% for the same period last year. Non-interest expense as a percentage of average assets fell to 0.89% in the first quarter of 2018, as compared to 1.02% for the same period last year.\nPresident Robert H. Gaughen Jr. stated, “We are pleased to report that returns on equity and assets remained satisfactory in the first quarter of 2018. At Hingham, we take seriously our role as stewards of shareholders’ capital. Our emphasis on careful capital allocation, defensive underwriting, process improvement, and disciplined cost control continues to serve our owners well. Performance in any one period should be viewed cautiously. The real test of performance in banking is a company’s record of compounding shareholder capital through all stages of the credit cycle. On this measure, our team strives to set a high bar.\nBeginning this quarter, we are confronted by a communication challenge because of the new accounting standard impacting our equity investments. The Bank views its equity investments as long-term partnership interests in operating companies and consequently does not view short-term fluctuation in market value, whether positive as it was this quarter, or negative as it surely will be at some point in the future, as indicative of the change in the intrinsic value of the portfolio holdings. The performance of these holdings should be evaluated on the basis of their contribution to growth in book value per share over time, not via quarterly adjustments to net income. We have historically avoided reporting adjustments to our GAAP income, as such adjustments are often used by management teams to obscure rather than clarify the real economic performance of a company. We believe that in this instance, however, it is important that our owners understand that quarterly changes in the value of the equity portfolio, whether gains or losses, are impostors just the same.”\nHingham Institution for Savings is a Massachusetts-chartered savings bank located in Hingham, Massachusetts.
