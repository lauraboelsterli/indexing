    "text": " 21 PM / Updated 27 minutes ago Russell Simmons and accuser agree to dismiss rape lawsuit Reuters Staff 1 Hip hop producer Russell Simmons and an aspiring documentary filmmaker have agreed to dismiss her civil lawsuit claiming that Simmons raped her at his Los Angeles home in 2016, court documents filed on Wednesday showed. FILE PHOTO: Def Jam co-founder Russell Simmons arrives at the 2010 Vanity Fair Oscar party in West Hollywood, California, U.S. March 7, 2010. REUTERS/Danny Moloshok/File Photo\nThe case, filed in January in U.S. Court in Los Angeles, was dismissed with prejudice, meaning it cannot be filed again.\nThe filmmaker, Jennifer Jarosik, had accused Simmons of forcing her to have sex with him after she refused his advance. She had sought $5 million in damages. Simmons has denied the accusation.\nSimmonsâ€™ attorney Patricia Glaser declined comment. An attorney for Jarosik did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nSeveral women have accused the 60-year-old Def Jam Records co-founder of sexual misconduct dating back to 1983, including four who said he raped them. Simmons has denied all of the accusations. Reporting by Eric Kelsey Additional reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York",
