    "text": "DALLAS, April 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) (\"AT&T\") announced today the expiration of its four separate offers to purchase for cash (the \"Cash Offers\"), any and all of the outstanding notes listed in the table below which have a special mandatory redemption provision (collectively, the \"Old Notes\"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase dated March 29, 2018 (the \"Offer to Purchase\" and, together with the accompanying notice of guaranteed delivery, the \"Cash Offer Documents\").\nThe Cash Offers expired at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 5, 2018 (the \"Cash Offer Expiration Date\"). The \"Cash Offer Settlement Date\" will be promptly following the Cash Offer Expiration Date and is expected to be April 10, 2018. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, the table below provides the aggregate principal amount of each series of Old Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Cash Offer Expiration Date and the aggregate principal amount of each series of Old Notes that AT&T expects to accept on the Cash Offer Settlement Date in connection with the Cash Offers.\nTitle of Series of Old Notes to be Purchased\nPrincipal Amount Outstanding\n(mm)\nCUSIP/ISIN No.\nPrincipal Amount Tendered(1)(2)\nPrincipal Amount AT&T Expects to Accept(2)\n5.300% Global Notes due 2058\n$2,500.00\n00206REQ1;\nUS00206REQ11\n$4,718,000\n$4,718,000\n5.150% Global Notes due 2050\n$4,951.50\n00206REP3;\nUS00206REP38\n$3,967,000\n$3,967,000\n4.900% Global Notes due 2037\n$4,500.00\n00206REN8;\nUS00206REN89\n$5,913,000\n$5,913,000\nFloating Rate Global Notes due 2023\n$750.00\n00206REJ7;\nUS00206REJ77\n$8,162,000\n$8,162,000\n(1) Reflects the aggregate principal amount of each series of Old Notes that have been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn as of the Cash Offer Expiration Date, based on information provided by the tender agent to AT&T.\n(2) The principal amounts tendered and expected to be accepted as reflected in the table above, do not include the aggregate principal amounts of Old Notes that may be validly tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Cash Offers.\nBased on the amount of Old Notes tendered in the Cash Offers and in accordance with the terms of the Cash Offers, AT&T expects to accept, on the Cash Offer Settlement Date, all of the Old Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Cash Offer Documents, Cash Offer Eligible Holders (as defined below) who (i) validly tendered and who did not validly withdraw Old Notes at or prior to the Cash Offer Expiration Date or (ii) delivered a properly completed and duly executed notice of guaranteed delivery and all other required documents at or prior to the Cash Offer Expiration Date and who tender their Old Notes at or prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on April 9, 2018 pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures, and whose Old Notes are accepted for purchase by AT&T, will receive the applicable Total Consideration (as defined in the Offer to Purchase). Cash Offer Eligible Holders are required to tender in the applicable minimum denominations in order to receive the applicable Total Consideration.\nUpon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Offer to Purchase, on the Cash Offer Settlement Date, AT&T expects to pay an aggregate total consideration of (i) $8,182,405.00 for the Floating Rate Global Notes due 2023, plus accrued and unpaid interest of $33,959.79; (ii) $5,927,782.50 for the 4.900% Global Notes due 2037, plus accrued and unpaid interest of $45,070.18; (iii) $3,976,917.50 for the 5.150% Global Notes due 2050, plus accrued and unpaid interest of $31,780.08 and (iv) $4,729,795.00 for the 5.300% Global Notes due 2058, plus accrued and unpaid interest of $38,897.26, in each case for the respective series of Old Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Cash Offers. The actual aggregate total consideration that will be paid on the Cash Offer Settlement Date is subject to change based on deliveries under the guaranteed delivery procedures and final validation of tenders. Interest will cease to accrue on the Cash Offer Settlement Date for all Old Notes accepted, including those tendered through the guaranteed delivery procedures. No further interest will be paid to the Cash Offer Eligible Holders who tender such Old Notes, including if a record date for an interest payment on such Old Notes has passed before the Cash Offer Settlement Date.\nAll holders of Old Notes were authorized to participate in the Cash Offers (the \"Cash Offer Eligible Holders\").\nThis press release is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities described herein.
