    "text": "April 20, 2018 / 7:27 PM / Updated 35 minutes ago Twenty dead in air strike in southwestern Yemen - residents Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nDUBAI (Reuters) - Twenty people were killed in an air strike by a Saudi-led coalition in southwestern Yemen on Friday, residents said. \nThey said the air strike hit a car transporting 20 passengers south of Taiz province. They said six bodies had been identified but the rest were charred beyond recognition. \nA spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. \nThe coalition intervened in Yemenâ€™s civil war in 2015 against the Iran-aligned Houthis who ousted the internationally recognised government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The Houthis now control the capital Sanaa. \nCoalition air strikes have repeatedly struck civilian targets while trying to target Houthi forces during the three-year war. The coalition says it does not target civilians. \nHouthi fighters killed two people, including a woman, and wounded four others on Friday in an attack north of Taiz, residents and medical sources said. \nThe Yemen war has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than 2 million and driven the country to the verge of famine, according to the United Nations.
