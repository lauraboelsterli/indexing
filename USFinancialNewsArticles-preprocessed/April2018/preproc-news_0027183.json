Herbert Diess, Volkswagen's new CEO addresses the media during a news conference at the Volkswagen plant in Wolfsburg, Germany April 13, 2018. REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer \nSpeaking at his first news conference as chief executive at VW’s headquarters in Wolfsburg, Diess said he would look at the different assets in VW’s portfolio, which include Renk and MAN Diesel, and review whether keeping them makes sense. \n“We will review all options,” Diess said, adding that this could include investing in the businesses or pursuing a sale.
