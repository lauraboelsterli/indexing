    "text": "1 COMMENTS JAKARTA, Indonesia—The Indonesian government said Monday that ride-hailing firms Grab Inc. and PT Go-Jek Indonesia must be registered as transportation companies to ensure safety and provide job protections for their drivers.\nThe move removes the option for the firms to be designated as technology companies, which facilitated easier use of drivers as partners and sparked resistance from traditional taxi operators and, increasingly, their own drivers.\nA woman rides on a Go-Jek motorcycle taxi.

Competition authorities in several countries have said they are on the alert for any sign of anticompetitive behavior.\nTransportation minister Budi Karya Sumadi told a press briefing that the ministry will meet the two companies to discuss the transition from tech middlemen to transportation firms in coming days. Mr. Sumadi said the change will enable drivers to “directly communicate with the companies.”\nIndonesia has struggled for more than two years to regulate ride-hailing companies, issuing a series of regulations to ensure the safety of drivers and customers and to meet complaints from traditional taxi firms who say their new rivals are evading costlier rules.\nBoth firms have expanded rapidly. They offer not only transportation services, but many more including food deliveries. Go-Jek, an Indonesian company, even offers massage and cleaning services.\nThe new regulation concerns only cars used as online taxis. But the huge numbers of motorcycle-taxi drivers who wear the colorful Grab and Go-Jek jackets are also asking for government help in dealing with the firms, saying their compensation is inadequate.\nMr. Sumadi said Monday that the ministry will help mediate between the motorcycle-taxi drivers and the companies, but refused their request to set floor prices, stating that motorcycles aren’t official recognized as a mode of public transport.\nWrite to Anita Rachman at Anita.Rachman@wsj.com",
