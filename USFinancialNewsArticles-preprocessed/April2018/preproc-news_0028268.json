    "text": "LUSAKA, April 13 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund has not asked Zambia to undertake an independent debt audit following market speculation that its foreign debt may be higher than stated, the country’s finance minister said on Friday.\n“Suffice to say, we have never been requested by any entity, including the IMF, to conduct such an exercise,” Finance Minister Margaret Mwanakatwe said in a statement.\nZambia said on Wednesday its $8.7 billion foreign debt has not been understated and those saying it is higher should produce evidence.
