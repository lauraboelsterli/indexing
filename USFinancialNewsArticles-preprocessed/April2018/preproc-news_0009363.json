The benchmark had closed up 0.2 percent on Wednesday.\nThe ‘Big Four’ banks were the biggest boost on the benchmark and ended up more than 1 percent each, followed by healthcare stock CSL Ltd adding 0.9 percent.\nConsumer stock Treasury Wine Estates was up 1.8 percent, while conglomerate Wesfarmers climbed 0.8 percent.\nOn the other hand, iron ore and steel miners corked gains as BHP, Rio Tinto, Fortescue Metals and Bluescope Steel fell between 0.7 percent and 3.2 percent. Iron ore and steel on the Dalian commodities exchange were lower on Wednesday before closing for a two-day holiday.\nShares of MG Unit Trust, the funding vehicle of Murray Goulburn dairy co-operative, ended 0.5 percent lower after Murray’s shareholders voted in favour of the $1 billion takeover by Canadian cheesemaker Saputo Inc.\nThe deal, which is pending foreign investment board approval, would make Saputo the biggest diary processor in Australia, rivalling New Zealand’s Fonterra . Fonterra Shareholders’ Fund finished the session 3.2 percent lower.\nNew Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index fell 0.4 percent, or 34.09 points, to 8,363.99 after having logged two straight days of gains.\nSpark New Zealand weighed on the index the most, while Sky Network Television was the worst performer on the index, down 2.1 percent.
