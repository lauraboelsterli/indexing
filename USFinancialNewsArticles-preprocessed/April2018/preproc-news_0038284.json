The investment continues Vista’s focus on acquiring best-in-class software businesses, providing mission-critical solutions to customers. Existing owner Providence Strategic Growth (“PSG”) will retain a minority ownership stake in LogicMonitor moving forward.\n“Vista enables some of the most impactful software companies on the market today to grow quickly while expanding innovation,” said Kevin McGibben, Chief Executive Officer at LogicMonitor. “Our platform delivers real-time performance visibility to IT operations so global enterprises, managed service providers, and modern web technology companies can scale to deliver superior products and services.

Reardon, Managing Director, Providence Strategic Growth.\nGartner predicts more than 20.4 billion devices will come on-line by 2020, greatly increasing the need for a solution that can monitor their performance in real-time, and alert IT teams to potential outages and disruptions.

LogicMonitor includes out-of-the-box coverage for thousands of technologies across the IT stack including Cisco, Kubernetes, NetApp, and VMware, offering granular visibility across the IT and application infrastructure anywhere these resources sit-- on premises, in the data center, or in the cloud.\nThe transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of this year.
