    "text": "SEOUL, April 16 (Reuters) - Korean Air Lines said that it has suspended senior vice president Cho Hyun-min from her duties as of Monday following a police probe into her alleged abusive behaviour.\nThe company will take appropriate action after the police probe ends, the airline said in a statement.\nKorean Air Lines’ unions have called for Cho, the youngest daughter of its chairman and a sister of the infamous ‘nut rage’ heiress, to step down from management after media reports said she threw water at the face of an advertising agency manager, sparking a public backlash.
