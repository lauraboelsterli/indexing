    "text": "Reggie Jackson had 24 points, including six in overtime, and added seven assists as the Detroit Pistons edged past the Dallas Mavericks 113-106 on Friday night art Little Caesars Arena in Detroit.\nAndre Drummond supplied 19 points, 16 rebounds and five assists for the Pistons, who were eliminated from playoff contention with a loss to Philadelphia on Wednesday. Anthony Tolliver tossed in 16 points, and Langston Galloway added 15 off the bench.\nJohnathan Motley racked up a career-best 26 points along with 12 rebounds for the Mavs. Harrison Barnes had 17 points and Dorian Finney-Smith contributed 15 points, 10 rebounds and four assists.\nBoth teams were depleted by injuries. Dallas star forward Dirk Nowitzki underwent left ankle surgery on Thursday. Guard J.J. Barea, who will miss the remainder of the season with a left rib muscle strain, was among several other Mavs regulars who didn’t play.\nDetroit was down two starters, including its star forward Blake Griffin, who sat out his fourth straight game with a bone bruise on his right ankle. Shooting guard Reggie Bullock did not dress due to left knee swelling.\nGalloway drained a 3-pointer with 2:15 left in overtime to give Detroit a 108-105 lead. Jackson’s jumper with 1:29 left increased the lead to five. After Tolliver took a charge, Jackson flipped in another shot to put the game away.\nThe Mavs won the first meeting in Dallas 110-93 on Dec. 20, taking control with a 43-point second quarter. The rematch was a seesaw battle, as the Pistons entered the fourth clinging to a 78-75 advantage.\nDallas opened the fourth with a 10-2 run behind Finney-Smith, who made a dunk and a 3-pointer. The Pistons answered with seven straight points.\nThe teams then traded baskets until Jackson made a pullup and Tolliver jammed home his own miss to give Detroit a 97-93 lead.\nThe Pistons came up empty in two straight trips while leading by three in the late going, and Motley tied the score at 101-all on a wide-open three with 10.1 seconds left.\nJackson’s driving shot in the lane came up short, forcing overtime.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
