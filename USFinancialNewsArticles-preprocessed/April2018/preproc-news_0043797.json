    "text": "WATERBURY, Conn., April 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Webster Financial Corporation (NYSE: WBS), the holding company for Webster Bank, N.A. and its HSA Bank division, today announced earnings applicable to common shareholders of $78.1 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $57.3 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\n\"Webster's first quarter results demonstrate the meaningful progress we are making on the execution of our strategic priorities,\" said John Ciulla, president and chief executive officer. \"Total revenues increased more than 10 percent from a year ago, driven by a 22 basis point increase in the net interest margin. Revenue growth, continuing investment, and effective risk management are enabling Webster to produce increasing levels of economic profit.\"\nHighlights for the first quarter of 2018:\nRevenue of $282.9 million, an increase of 10.6 percent from a year ago, including net interest income of $214.2 million, an increase of 11.2 percent from a year ago. Loan growth of $711 million, or 4.2 percent from a year ago, with growth of $654 million, or 6.4 percent, in commercial and commercial real estate loans. Deposit growth of $1.1 billion, or 5.6 percent from a year ago, with growth of $694 million, or 14.5 percent, in health savings account deposits. Net interest margin of 3.44 percent, up 22 basis points from a year ago. Pre-tax, pre-provision net revenue growth of $19.4 million, or 21.1 percent from a year ago, led by HSA Bank's growth of 59.6 percent. Annualized return on average common shareholders' equity of 12.15 percent compared to 9.43 percent a year ago; annualized return on average tangible common shareholders' equity (non-GAAP) of 15.73 percent compared to 12.47 percent a year ago.\n\"Our ongoing balance sheet transformation is producing tangible results,\" said Glenn MacInnes, executive vice president and chief financial officer. \"Our loan portfolio yield is 40 basis points higher than a year ago as 52 percent of our loans reprice in 30 days or less. The cost of deposits has increased only 7 basis points as 57 percent of our deposits are in low-costing transactional and health savings accounts.\"\nLine of Business performance compared to the first quarter of 2017:\nCommercial Banking\nWebster's Commercial Banking segment serves middle market, commercial real estate, asset-based lending, equipment finance, private banking, and treasury and payment solutions clients. As of March 31, 2018, Commercial Banking had $9.7 billion in loans and leases and $4.0 billion in deposit balances.\nCommercial Banking Operating Results:\nThree months ended March 31,\n(In thousands)\n2018\n2017\nNet interest income\n$84,651\n$78,247\nNon-interest income\n15,316\n13,424\nOperating revenue\n99,967\n91,671\nNon-interest expense\n41,245\n38,124\nPre-tax, pre-provision net revenue\n$58,722\n$53,547\nAt March 31,\n(In millions)\n2018\n2017\nLoans and leases\n$9,686\n$9,112\nDeposits\n$4,041\n$3,918\nPre-tax, pre-provision net revenue increased $5.2 million to $58.7 million in the quarter as compared to prior year. Net interest income increased $6.4 million to $84.7 million, primarily due to loan growth and higher deposit margin. Non-interest income increased $1.9 million to $15.3 million, primarily due to greater client interest rate hedging activity in the quarter as compared to prior year. Non-interest expense increased $3.1 million to $41.2 million, primarily due to investments in people and technology.\nHSA Bank\nWebster's HSA Bank division offers a comprehensive consumer-directed healthcare solution that includes health savings accounts, health reimbursement arrangements, flexible spending accounts and commuter benefits. Health savings accounts are distributed nationwide directly to employers and individual consumers, as well as through national and regional insurance carriers, benefit consultants and financial advisors. As of March 31, 2018, HSA Bank had $6.9 billion in total footings comprising $5.5 billion in deposit balances and $1.4 billion in assets under administration through linked investment accounts.\nHSA Bank Operating Results:\nThree months ended March 31,\n(In thousands)\n2018\n2017\nNet interest income\n$32,924\n$24,052\nNon-interest income\n22,669\n19,271\nOperating revenue\n55,593\n43,323\nNon-interest expense\n31,515\n28,239\nPre-tax net revenue\n$24,078\n$15,084\nAt March 31,\n(In millions)\n2018\n2017\nNumber of accounts\n2,643\n2,364\nDeposits\n$5,488\n$4,794\nLinked investment accounts*\n1,364\n992\nTotal footings\n$6,852\n$5,786\n*Linked investment accounts are held off balance sheet\nPre-tax net revenue increased $9.0 million to $24.1 million in the quarter as compared to prior year. Net interest income increased $8.9 million to $32.9 million, primarily due to growth in deposits and improved deposit spreads. Non-interest income increased $3.4 million to $22.7 million, primarily due to growth in accounts over the past year. Non-interest expense increased $3.3 million to $31.5 million, primarily due to account growth and continued investment in the business including expanded distribution.\nCommunity Banking\nCommunity Banking serves consumer and business banking customers primarily throughout southern New England and into Westchester County, New York. Community Banking is comprised of the Personal Banking and Business Banking operating segments, as well as a distribution network consisting of 167 banking centers and 333 ATMs, a customer care center, and a full range of web and mobile-based banking services.\nAs of March 31, 2018, Community Banking had $8.1 billion in loans and $11.6 billion in deposit balances.\nCommunity Banking Operating Results:\nThree months ended March 31,\n(In thousands)\n2018\n2017\nNet interest income\n$98,928\n$93,590\nNon-interest income\n25,195\n25,379\nOperating revenue\n124,123\n118,969\nNon-interest expense\n96,829\n95,179\nPre-tax, pre-provision net revenue\n$27,294\n$23,790\nAt March 31,\n(In millions)\n2018\n2017\nLoans\n$8,121\n$7,985\nDeposits\n11,580\n11,156\nPre-tax, pre-provision net revenue increased $3.5 million to $27.3 million in the quarter as compared to prior year. Net interest income increased $5.3 million to $98.9 million, primarily due to growth in loan and deposit balances, as well as improved interest rate spreads on deposits. Non-interest income decreased $0.2 million primarily driven by lower mortgage production and related returns on mortgage banking activities, offset by growth in fees from investment services, credit cards and client interest rate hedging activities. Non-interest expense increased $1.7 million as a result of higher compensation expenses coupled with investments in technology and risk management, partially offset by lower direct marketing expenses.\nConsolidated financial performance:\nQuarterly net interest income compared to the first quarter of 2017:\nNet interest income was $214.2 million compared to $192.7 million. Net interest margin was 3.44 percent compared to 3.22 percent. The yield on interest-earning assets increased by 28 basis points, and the cost of funds increased by 7 basis points. Average interest-earning assets totaled $25.1 billion and grew by $717 million, or 2.9 percent. Average loans totaled $17.8 billion and grew by $714 million, or 4.2 percent.\nQuarterly provision for loan losses:\nThe Company recorded a provision for loan losses of $11.0 million, compared to $13.0 million in the prior quarter and $10.5 million a year ago. Net charge-offs were $5.6 million, compared to $14.8 million in the prior quarter and $5.7 million a year ago. The decrease to prior quarter is primarily due to decreased commercial charge-offs. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans on an annualized basis was 0.13 percent, compared to 0.34 percent in the prior quarter and 0.13 percent a year ago. The allowance for loan losses represented 1.15 percent of total loans at March 31, 2018 compared to 1.14 percent at December 31, 2017 and 1.16 percent at March 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses represented 153 percent of nonperforming loans compared to 158 percent at December 31, 2017 and 115 percent at March 31, 2017.\nQuarterly non-interest income compared to the first quarter of 2017:\nTotal non-interest income was $68.7 million compared to $63.0 million, an increase of $5.7 million. This reflects increases of $3.4 million driven by account growth and $2.9 million related to client hedging and break-funding revenue, offset by a decrease of $1.1 million in mortgage banking activities driven by lower originations.\nQuarterly non-interest expense compared to the first quarter of 2017:\nTotal non-interest expense was $171.6 million compared to $163.8 million, an increase of $7.8 million. This reflects an increase of $7.3 million in compensation and benefits along with an increase of $2.3 million in technology and equipment, offset by a decrease of $1.9 million in marketing.\nQuarterly income taxes compared to the first quarter of 2017:\nIncome tax expense was $20.1 million compared to $22.0 million and the effective tax rate was 20.0 percent compared to 27.0 percent. The lower effective tax rate in the quarter primarily reflects the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate effective in 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017.\nInvestment securities:\nTotal investment securities were $7.2 billion compared to $7.1 billion at December 31, 2017 and $7.1 billion at March 31, 2017. The carrying value of the available-for-sale portfolio included $74.0 million of net unrealized losses compared to $37.1 million at December 31, 2017 and $28.2 million at March 31, 2017. The carrying value of the held-to-maturity portfolio does not reflect $111.3 million of net unrealized losses compared to $31.0 million at December 31, 2017, and $41.6 million at March 31, 2017.\nLoans:\nTotal loans were $17.8 billion compared to $17.5 billion at December 31, 2017 and $17.1 billion at March 31, 2017. Compared to December 31, 2017, commercial loans increased by $359.6 million and commercial real estate loans increased by $21.0 million, while consumer loans decreased by $67.8 million and residential loans decreased by $31.0 million. Compared to a year ago, commercial loans increased by $639.3 million, residential loans increased by $169.2 million, and commercial real estate loans increased by $14.3 million, while consumer loans decreased by $111.7 million. Loan originations for portfolio were $1.111 billion compared to $1.302 billion in the prior quarter and $1.107 billion a year ago. In addition, $43 million of residential loans were originated for sale in the quarter compared to $60 million in the prior quarter and $73 million a year ago.\nAsset quality:\nTotal nonperforming loans were $134.3 million, or 0.75 percent of total loans, compared to $126.6 million, or 0.72 percent, at December 31, 2017 and $173.8 million, or 1.02 percent, at March 31, 2017. Total paying nonperforming loans were $32.2 million compared to $33.2 million at December 31, 2017 and $73.5 million at March 31, 2017. Past due loans were $41.6 million compared to $45.8 million at December 31, 2017 and $32.1 million at March 31, 2017.\nDeposits and borrowings:\nTotal deposits were $21.4 billion compared to $21.0 billion at December 31, 2017 and $20.2 billion at March 31, 2017. Core deposits to total deposits were 88.1 percent compared to 88.2 percent at December 31, 2017 and 90.0 percent at March 31, 2017.

Total borrowings were $2.4 billion compared to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2017 and $3.0 billion at March 31, 2017.\nCapital:\nThe return on average common shareholders' equity and the return on average tangible common shareholders' equity were 12.15 percent and 15.73 percent, respectively, compared to 9.43 percent and 12.47 percent, respectively, in the first quarter of 2017.

The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP, this press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of net income and other performance ratios, as adjusted, is included in the accompanying selected financial highlights table.\nWe believe that providing certain non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with information useful in understanding our financial performance, our performance trends and financial position. We utilize these measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes.

We believe that our presentation and discussion, together with the accompanying reconciliations, provides a complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business and allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to management. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures and results, and we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.\nWEBSTER FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nSelected Financial Highlights (unaudited)\nAt or for the Three Months Ended\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember

Measures\nThe Company evaluates its business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures the Company's net income available to common shareholders, adjusted for the tax-effected amortization of intangible assets, as a percentage of average\nshareholders' equity less average preferred stock and average goodwill and intangible assets. The tangible equity ratio represents shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets. The tangible common equity ratio represents shareholders' equity less preferred stock and goodwill\nand intangible assets divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets. Tangible book value per common share represents shareholders' equity less preferred stock and goodwill and intangible assets divided by common shares outstanding at the end of the period.\nThe efficiency ratio, which measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, is calculated excluding foreclosed property expense, amortization of intangibles, gain or loss on securities, and other non-recurring items. Core deposits express total deposits less time deposits.
