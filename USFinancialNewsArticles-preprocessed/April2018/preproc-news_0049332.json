    "text": "LAKE FOREST, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Akorn, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKRX), today filed a complaint in Delaware Chancery Court asking that Fresenius Kabi AG be required to fulfill its obligations under the definitive merger agreement, and issued the following statement:\n“Fresenius’ attempt to terminate the transaction on the pretext that the findings from the ongoing investigation are a breach of the merger agreement is completely without merit. The previously disclosed ongoing investigation, of which we have voluntarily notified and are in regular communication with the Food and Drug Administration, has not found any facts that would result in a material adverse effect on Akorn’s business and therefore there is no basis to terminate the transaction. The investigation is not a condition to closing and the only remaining condition is approval from the Federal Trade Commission. We intend to vigorously enforce our rights, and Fresenius’ obligations, under our binding merger agreement.”\nThe transaction was announced on April 24, 2017 after the boards of directors of both companies approved the sale of Akorn to Fresenius Kabi for $34.00 a share in cash. Akorn shareholders voted overwhelmingly to approve the transaction on July 19, 2017.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis communication contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

KGaA (the “Merger Agreement”), including in circumstances which would require Akorn to pay a termination fee or other expenses; (iv) the effect of the announcement or pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on Akorn’s ability to retain and hire key personnel, its ability to maintain relationships with its customers, suppliers and others with whom it does business, or its operating results and business generally; (v) risks related to diverting management’s attention from Akorn’s ongoing business operations; (vi) the risk that shareholder litigation in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement may result in significant costs of defense, indemnification and liability, (vii) the outcome of the investigations conducted by Akorn and Fresenius Kabi AG, with the assistance of their respective outside consultants, into alleged breaches of FDA data integrity requirements relating to product development at Akorn and any actions taken by Akorn, third parties or the FDA as a result of such investigations, (viii) the outcome of the above described litigation and (ix) the risk factors detailed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 (as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 28, 2018) and other risk factors identified herein or from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
