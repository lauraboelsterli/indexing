    "text": "Published: Apr 12, 2018 10:39 a.m. ET Share \nCompany weighs merging units with other public companies; an IPO or spinoff for transportation division is near Bloomberg In October, CEO John Flannery promised to sell $20 billion worth of assets. So far GE has announced a handful of deals totaling less than $4 billion. \nBy Dana Mattioli David Benoit \nAs its strategic review stretches into a ninth month, General Electric Co. is exploring a public offering for one of its divisions and discussing hybrid deals with public companies to combine assets, according to people familiar with the matter. \nRather than straight asset sales, the hybrid deals would leave GE GE, +0.31% shareholders with stakes in multiple public companies. The possibilities include spinning off a division to investors or combining a division with a smaller public company in a way that avoids a big tax bill. Such moves would give the industrial conglomerate and its shareholders a chance to participate in the turnaround of struggling businesses rather than risk selling at inopportune times. \nRead: GE to Sell part of healthcare business to Veritas Capital for $1.05 billion \nGE Transportation could be a model, according to some of the people. GE is now unlikely to sell the business and is preparing for an initial public offering or spinoff of the division, which makes diesel freight locomotives, some of the people said. The unit could be merged with another firm that would leave GE investors in control of a new public company, one person said. ‘The pressure on GE to announce some sort of break-up is very high.’ Analyst Scott Davis of Melius Research \nGE, whose share price has tumbled by more than half over the last 12 months, will be facing questions about its portfolio review in coming weeks. The company reports first-quarter results on April 20 and hosts its annual shareholder meeting the following week. Chairman and CEO John Flannery is the headliner at a major industrial conference on May 23.",
