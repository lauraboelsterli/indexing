    "text": "NEW YORK, - Sentinel Capital Partners, a private equity firm that invests in promising companies at the lower end of the midmarket, today announced the acquisition of UBEO Business Services, a premier provider of printer, copier, and related office equipment sales and services in Texas. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.\nHeadquartered in San Antonio, Texas, UBEO is a provider of best-in-class document management equipment and related services. UBEO facilitates business technology integration by offering the newest, best, and most innovative ideas in hardware and software solutions to its customer base of approximately 6,000 mid-sized businesses, schools, and municipalities.

UBEO manages an installed base of approximately 20,000 machines and maintains long-term relationships with leading vendors such as Konica Minolta, Kyocera, Ricoh, and Xerox.\n\"We are very excited about the acquisition of UBEO and partnering with a regional market leader with a stable, highly recurring business model, high margins and strong free cash flow characteristics,\" said Scott Perry, a partner at Sentinel. \"As the largest independent dealer in Texas, UBEO is a scalable platform and ideal for consolidating its highly fragmented industry. We are very pleased to partner with a highly experienced, talented, and strongly committed management team that has a proven record of profitable growth.\"\n\"We are very proud of the reputation we have built,\" said Jim Sheffield, President and CEO of UBEO. \"UBEO outperforms its competition in the service categories that our customers value most – technical capability, service quality, and on-time delivery. Partnering with Sentinel well positions us for our next phase of profitable growth.\"\nThe past 12 months have been highly productive for Sentinel.
