REUTERS/Peter Nicholls/File Photo \n“We will be seeking the advice of the UK’s independent advisors, the Committee on Climate Change, on the implications of the Paris Agreement for the UK’s long-term emissions reduction targets,” Claire Perry said \nPerry is Britain’s minister for energy and clean growth and made the comments during a speech as part of this week’s Commonwealth heads of government meeting in London \nBritain has a legally binding target to cut emissions by 80 percent on 1990 levels by 2050 \nExperts have warned this will not be enough to put the country on a path to help limit a rise in global temperatures to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times, as agreed by more than 190 nations in Paris in 2015. \nBritain’s review of its targets will take place after the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change issues a report later this year on the potential impact of global warming above 1.5 degrees, Perry said.
