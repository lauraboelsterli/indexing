    "text": "PRIORITIZING FURTHER MINERAL RESERVE AND RESOURCE EXPANSION\nTORONTO, April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - Superior Gold Inc. (\"Superior Gold\" or the \"Company\") (TSX.V:SGI) is pleased to announce that it has added a third underground diamond drill at its 100%-owned Plutonic Gold mine in Western Australia.\nChris Bradbrook, President and CEO of Superior Gold stated: \"Since the acquisition of the Plutonic Gold operations in October 2016, we have had two underground diamond drills operating. These have been primarily focused on grade control work and to a lesser extent, resource definition. This third diamond drill is expected to complete approximately 3,000 metres per month and will be focused solely on mineral reserve and resource definition and expansion.\nWe recently provided an updated mineral reserve and resource update (April 3, 2018). At that time, we announced that we hoped to provide an updated estimate during 2018. The addition of this dedicated diamond drill will allow us to work towards this goal.\"\nQualified Person\nScientific and technical information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Pascal Blampain, who is a member of the AusIMM and the Australian Institute of Geoscientists (AIG) and a \"qualified person\" within the meaning of NI 43-101. Mr. Blampain is an employee of the Company and serves as Chief Geologist.\nAbout Superior Gold\nSuperior Gold is a Canadian based gold producer that owns 100% of the Plutonic Gold operations located in Western Australia.
