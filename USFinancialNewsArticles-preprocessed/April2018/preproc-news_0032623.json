    "text": "April 19th, 2018 North America \nMexico has banned federal institutions and state governments from doing business with Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht SA for the next 2-1/2 years, and fined the company around $60 million, the government said. \nState bodies are prohibited from “participating in federal public contracts or any contract with Construtora Norberto Odebrecht S.A.,” the government’s official gazette said late on Tuesday. Existing contracts were not affected, it added. \nTwo units of the Brazilian company had each been fined 543.5 million pesos ($30.1 million), a government document showed. Two legal representatives of the company were also fined 1.26 million pesos ($69,700) each, it added. \nThe decisions relate to probes into suspected corruption involving Odebrecht’s business with state oil firm Pemex, officials say. The government did not provide details. \nThe full original article can be found at reuters.com",
