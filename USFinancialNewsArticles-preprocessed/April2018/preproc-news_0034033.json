    "text": "OSLO, April 17 (Reuters) - Norwegian housing prices fell by 0.3 percent in the first quarter of 2018 from the fourth of last year on a seasonally adjusted basis, Statistics Norway (SSB) said on Tuesday.\nOn a year-on-year basis, prices were down 1.1 percent in the first quarter.\nAnalysts have pointed to tighter mortgage regulations, lower population growth and a boom in construction to help explain a fall in prices from a peak in early 2017.\nReporting by Terje Solsvik\n ",
