    "text": "April 22, 2018 / 10:13 PM / Updated 12 hours ago Golf-Landry wins Texas Open by two shots for PGA Tour breakthrough Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nApril 22 (Reuters) - Andrew Landry built a big lead and held on for his first PGA Tour victory, a two-stroke triumph at the Texas Open in San Antonio on Sunday. \nTexas-born Landry, who lives in nearby Austin, birdied the first three holes after starting the day tied for the lead with fellow American Zach Johnson. \nIn his 32nd start on tour, Landry parred the final seven holes to finish at 17-under 271 at TPC San Antonio while Trey Mullinax and Sean O’Hair tied for second on 15 under. \nMullinax’s hopes diminished when he chunked a pitch shot at the 17th hole, failing to clear a bunker between his ball and the hole. \nThe resulting bogey gave Landry the gift of a two-shot lead heading to the par-five 18th.
