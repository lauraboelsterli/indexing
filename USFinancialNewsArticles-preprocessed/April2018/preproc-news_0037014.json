The volume traded in the previous trading session was 1.88 billion. ** At close, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 22.65 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares. ** The price-to-earnings ratio of the Hang Seng index was 12.43 as of the last full trading day while the dividend yield was 3.2 percent.
