    "text": "Brazil's Lula will not turn himself to police - party source Published 11 Hours Ago Reuters \nBRASILIA, April 6 (Reuters) - Brazil's former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will not turn himself in to police on Friday as ordered by the judge who convicted him of corruption, a source in his Workers Party said. \nLula spent the night at the headquarters of the steelworkers union in Sao Paulo and was meeting with party leaders, the source said. Judge Sergio Moro ordered Lula to turn himself in by 5 p.m. (2000 GMT) on Friday to start serving a 12-year prison sentence after he lost an appeal of his bribery conviction.
