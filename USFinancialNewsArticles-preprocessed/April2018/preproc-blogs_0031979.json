    "text": "Casagrande set to take over as CEO of Sao Paulo's Cesp -source Luciano Costa Published 4 Hours Ago Reuters \nSAO PAULO,   Laurence Casagrande, chief executive of Sao Paulo state highway company Desenvolvimento Rodoviario SA, is set to become the new CEO of state electricity firm Cia Energetica de Sao Paulo, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. \nThe appointment of Casagrande, who will replace current CEO Mauro Arce, was communicated internally on Tuesday at Cesp, as the company is commonly known. The source, who requested anonymity because the matter is not yet public, did not know the reasons for the change. \nThe change of command comes in the middle of a privatization process at the state-run utility. It also comes amid changes in Sao Paulo's state government. \nEarlier in April, then-Governor Geraldo Alckmin resigned in order to run for president. \nCesp and the government of Sao Paulo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
