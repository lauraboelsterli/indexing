    "text": "MOUNT GILEAD, N.C., April 4, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- McRae Industries, Inc. (Pink Sheets: MCRAA and MCRAB) reported consolidated net revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 of $20,472,000 as compared to $28,113,000 for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Net earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 amounted to $681,000, or $0.28 per diluted Class A common share as compared to $1,633,000, or $0.68 per diluted Class A common share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nConsolidated net revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2018 totaled $42,870,000 as compared to $57,986,000 for the first six months of fiscal 2017. Net earnings for the first six months of fiscal 2018 amounted to $1,973,000, or $0.82 per diluted Class A common share, as compared to net earnings of $3,160,000, or $1.31 per diluted Class A common share, for the first six months of fiscal 2017.\nSECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2018 COMPARED TO SECOND QUARTER FISCAL 2017\nConsolidated net revenues totaled $20.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to $28.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Sales related to our western/lifestyle boot products for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 totaled $12.5 million as compared to $13.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. This 5% decrease in net revenues is primarily a result of decreased sales in our premium kid's boots, as well as a general softness in most sectors of our western/lifestyle boot products. Revenues from our work boot products decreased approximately 48%, from $14.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 to $7.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. This was primarily a result of decreased military boots sales, as we experience a gap in our multiple government contracts. As mentioned in the first quarter, the delivery time frame for the new contract for hot weather Army combat boots was extended. While the first delivery on this contract is scheduled for May 2018, we have been shipping a small quantity ahead of schedule. On March 30, 2018, McRae Industries received an award from the Defense Logistics Agency Troop Support for a maximum $75,476,836 firm-fixed price, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract for temperate weather combat boots. This is a one year base contract with four one year option periods. The first delivery is 120 days from the award date.\nConsolidated gross profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 amounted to approximately $5.0 million as compared to $7.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was down from 35.6% for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 to 32.0% for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. This is primarily due to lower sales of military boots.\nConsolidated selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses totaled approximately $4.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to $4.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. This decrease resulted primarily from decreased employee related expenses.\nAs a result of the above, the consolidated operating profit for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 amounted to $0.6 million as compared to $2.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\nFIRST SIX MONTHS FISCAL 2018 COMPARED TO FIRST SIX MONTHS FISCAL 2017\nConsolidated net revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2018 totaled $42.9 million as compared to $58.0 million for the first six months of fiscal 2017. Our western and lifestyle product sales totaled $24.7 million for the first six months of fiscal 2018 as compared to $27.5 million for the first six months of fiscal 2017, with the decrease primarily resulting from a decrease in sales for women's western boots and premium kid's boots. Net revenues from our work boot business declined from $29.5 million for the first six months of fiscal 2017 to $16.4 million for the first six months of fiscal 2018. This decrease in work boot products net revenues resulted primarily from lower military boot shipments associated with our U. S. Government contracts.\nConsolidated gross profit totaled $11.2 million for the first six months of fiscal 2018 as compared to $14.8 million for the first six months of fiscal 2017. Gross profit attributable to our western and lifestyle products totaled $8.7 million for the first six months of fiscal 2018, down from $9.7 million for the first six months of fiscal 2017. This decrease in gross profit is directly correlated with the decrease in sales. Our work boot products gross profit declined from $4.8 million for the first six months of fiscal 2017 to $1.8 million for the first six months of fiscal 2018. This decrease was driven by the overall decrease in military boot shipments.\nConsolidated selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses totaled approximately $8.6 million for the first six months of fiscal 2018 as compared to $9.8 million for the first six months of fiscal 2017. This decrease resulted primarily from decreased expenditures for computer services, commissions, and employee related expenses.\nAs a result of the above, the consolidated operating profit amounted to $2.6 million for the first six months of fiscal 2018 as compared to $5.0 million for the first six months of fiscal 2017.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nOur financial condition remained strong at January 27, 2018 as cash and cash equivalents totaled $32.3 million as compared to $28.1 million at July 29, 2017. Our working capital increased from $54.3 million at July 29, 2017 to $55.4 million at January 27, 2018.\nWe currently have two lines of credit totaling $6.75 million, all of which was fully available at January 27, 2018. One credit line totaling $1.75 million (which is restricted to one hundred percent of the outstanding receivables due from the Government) expires in January 2019. Our $5.0 million line of credit, which also expires in January 2019, is secured by the inventory and accounts receivable of our Dan Post Boot Company subsidiary. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and available credit lines will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for the remainder of fiscal 2018.\nFor the first six months of fiscal 2018, operating activities provided approximately $5.7 million of cash. Net earnings, as adjusted for depreciation, contributed approximately $2.6 million of cash. Decreased inventory levels in both of our boot businesses provided approximately $5.0 million of cash. Accounts payable, employee benefit distributions, accrued payroll and payroll taxes, and income tax payments used approximately $1.9 million of cash.\nNet cash used by investing activities totaled approximately $0.9 million, primarily for manufacturing machinery and equipment.\nNet cash used in financing activities totaled $0.6 million, which was used for dividend payments.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release includes certain forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those projected, estimated, assumed or anticipated in any such forward-looking statements include: the effect of competitive products and pricing, risks unique to selling goods to the Government (including variation in the Government's requirements for our products and the Government's ability to terminate its contracts with vendors), changes in fashion cycles and trends in the western boot business, loss of key customers, acquisitions, supply interruptions, additional financing requirements, our expectations about future Government orders for military boots, loss of key management personnel, our ability to successfully develop new products and services, and the effect of general economic conditions in our markets.\nMcRae Industries, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands, except share data)\n(Unaudited)\nJanuary 27,\n2018\nJuly 29,\n2017\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$32,293\n$28,057\nShort term securities\n506\n505\nAccounts and notes receivable, net\n12,505\n12,331\nInventories, net\n13,316\n18,273\nIncome tax receivable\n276\n329\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n300\n550\nTotal current assets\n59,196\n60,045\nProperty and equipment, net\n7,391\n7,391\nOther assets:\nDeposits\n14\n14\nLong term securities\n3,908\n3,804\nReal estate held for investment\n3,772\n3,601\nAmounts due from split-dollar life insurance\n2,288\n2,288\nTrademarks\n2,824\n2,824\nTotal other assets\n12,806\n12,531\nTotal assets\n$79,393\n$79,967\nMcRae Industries, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands, except share data)\n(Unaudited)\nJanuary 27,\n2018\nJuly 29,\n2017\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$2,170\n$2,510\nAccrued employee benefits\n354\n1,144\nAccrued payroll and payroll taxes\n538\n809\nAccrued income taxes\n0\n589\nOther\n734\n714\nTotal current liabilities\n3,796\n5,766\nShareholders' equity:\nCommon Stock:\nClass A, $1 par value; authorized 5,000,000 shares\nissued and outstanding, 2,022,983 and 2,014,842\nshares, respectively\n2,023\n2,015\nClass B, $1 par value; authorized 2,500,000 shares;\nissued and outstanding, 375,113 and 383,254 shares,\nrespectively\n375\n384\nUnrealized losses on investments, net of tax\n41\n(5)\nRetained earnings\n73,158\n71,807\nTotal shareholders' equity\n75,597\n74,201\nTotal liabilities and shareholders' equity\n$79,393\n$79,967\nMcRae Industries, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In thousands, except share data)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended\nSix Months Ended\nJanuary 27,\nJanuary 28,\nJanuary 27,\nJanuary 28,\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nNet revenues\n$20,472\n$28,113\n$42,870\n$57,986\nCost of revenues\n15,511\n20,727\n31,673\n43,231\nGross profit\n4,961\n7,386\n11,197\n14,755\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n4,404\n4,813\n8,603\n9,777\nOperating profit\n557\n2,573\n2,594\n4,978\nOther income\n111\n61\n189\n155\nEarnings before income taxes\n668\n2,634\n2,783\n5,133\nProvision for income taxes\n(13)\n1,001\n810\n1,973\nNet earnings\n$681\n$1,633\n$1,973\n$3,160\nEarnings per common share:\nDiluted earnings per share:\nClass A\n0.28\n0.68\n0.82\n1.31\nClass B\nNA\nNA\nNA\nNA\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding:\nClass A\n2,018,387\n2,030,710\n2,016,614\n2,030,684\nClass B\n379,709\n387,577\n381,482\n387,603\nTotal\n2,398,096\n2,418,287\n2,398,096\n2,418,287\nMcRae Industries, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In thousands)\n(Unaudited)\nSix Months Ended\nJanuary 27,\nJanuary 28,\n2018\n2017\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n5,714\n8,617\nCash Flows from Investing Activities:\nPurchase of land for investment\n(171)\n(25)\nCapital expenditures\n(627)\n(274)\nPurchase of securities\n(58)\n43\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(856)\n(256)\nCash Flows from Financing Activities:\nDividends paid\n(622)\n(628)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(622)\n(628)\nNet (Decrease) Increase in Cash and Cash equivalents\n4,236\n7,733\nCash and Cash Equivalents at Beginning of Year\n28,057\n15,673\nCash and Cash Equivalents at End of Year\n$32,293\n$23,406\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/mcrae-industries-inc-reports-earnings-for-the-second-quarter-and-first-six-months-of-fiscal-2018-300624591.html\nSOURCE McRae Industries, Inc.",
