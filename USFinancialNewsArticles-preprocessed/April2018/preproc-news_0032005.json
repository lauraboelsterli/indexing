    "text": "LONDON, April 16 (Reuters) - Short-dated U.S. Treasury yields on Monday rose to their highest level in almost a decade as safe-haven bond markets succumbed to selling pressure on hopes that a U.S.-led strike on Syria would not escalate into a broader conflict.\nThe two-year U.S. Treasury yield climbed to 2.386 percent in early European trade, its highest level since August 2008.\nThat pushed the gap over German two-year bond yields to 296 basis points, the widest since 1989.\nTen-year U.S. Treasury yields meanwhile rose to 2.86 percent , its highest in over three weeks.
