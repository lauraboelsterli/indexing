    "text": "April 25, 2018 / 7:00 AM / Updated 12 minutes ago BAT to raise investment in products such as e-cigarettes Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - British American Tobacco ( BATS.L ) plans to spend more this year on products such as e-cigarettes and devices that heat tobacco without burning it, with a large number of launches set for the end of the third quarter. FILE PHOTO: A man walks past the British American Tobacco offices in London, Britain October 21, 2016. REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth \nThe world’s second-biggest international tobacco company by revenue has pitched into the battleground for such alternatives, but it trails Philip Morris International ( PM.N ) in tobacco-heating devices that some see as more appealing to smokers. \nEarly e-cigarettes were made by independent businesses, but big tobacco companies have become dominant as they seek to counter shrinking global cigarette sales volumes. \nBAT also said foreign currency exchange rates would be a headwind for the overall business in 2018, but said it was on track for “another good year” of earnings growth, excluding the impact of currency translation. \nThe company expects profit growth to be skewed to the second half mainly due to volume shipment phasing and pricing in some markets, including the Gulf and Russia. \nShares of the company fell about 5 percent to an 18 month low in February on weaker than expected 2017 sales growth and progress on next-generation products. \nThe company, whose cigarette brands include Dunhill and Lucky Strike, said next-generation products contributed 500 million pounds of revenue in 2017. \nIt reiterated its aim to more than double its revenue from the next-generation products to substantially higher than 1 billion pounds this year.
