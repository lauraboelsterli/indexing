REUTERS/Eric Thayer/File Photo\nIn a note to clients, ISS also backed the election of all director nominees at Sturm Ruger ahead of its shareholder meeting scheduled for May 9.\nThe board of Connecticut company Sturm Ruger had recommended investors vote against the call for the safety report. Its proxy statement said that “the intentional criminal misuse of firearms is beyond our control. Similarly, the constitutional right of firearms ownership carries with it certain responsibilities and the Company has long advocated the safe and responsible ownership and use of firearms.”\nSturm Ruger representatives did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.\nSecond-ranked proxy adviser Glass Lewis made the same recommendations to Sturm Ruger investors on April 14, citing gun violence as a risk to the company’s reputation.\nJust what additional steps if any weapons makers should take on safety has drawn renewed interest in the wake of a shooting at a Florida high school in February in which 17 people were killed.\nBanks including Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp lately have restricted lending to clients involved with firearms. Also, asset managers including BlackRock Inc and Vanguard Group have said they would raise safety concerns with gunmakers whose stocks they own.\nBlackRock and Vanguard are the top two investors in Sturm Ruger, together with about 25 percent of shares.\nRepresentatives for both firms declined to discuss how they might vote at Sturm Ruger.\nThe shareholder proposal was filed by the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus and Mary in Oregon. It asks the company report on gun safety such as how it monitors violence, research on safer guns, and its assessment of risks to its reputation.\nThe proposal mentions smart guns, designs with electronic limits on their ability to fire, which it says could help reduce accidental shootings and suicides.\nSmart guns have faced opposition from gun rights groups concerned about their practicality and legislative implications.\nISS wrote the technology could make guns safer, and that a market for smart guns could help overcome engineering problems. ISS noted the proposal does not call for the production of smart guns, but only seeks evidence that Sturm Ruger’s board is properly assessing risks.
