    "text": "LAFAYETTE, La., April 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- IBERIABANK Corporation (NASDAQ: IBKC), holding company of the 131-year-old IBERIABANK ( www.iberiabank.com ), reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. For the quarter, the Company reported income available to common shareholders of $60.0 million, or $1.10 diluted earnings per common share (\"EPS\"). On a non-GAAP basis, EPS excluding non-core revenues and non-core expenses (\"Core EPS\") in the first quarter of 2018 was $1.37 per common share, compared to $1.02 in the year-ago period, an increase of 34% (refer to press release supplemental tables for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics).\nDaryl G. Byrd, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"I am very pleased with our first quarter 2018 results, as we achieved our Company's highest quarterly Core EPS result and are well- positioned for a strong year. More specifically, the quarter was in-line with our internal expectations, reflective of the predictable seasonality we have historically experienced. As such, we also wanted to re-affirm our confidence in our previously provided 2018 guidance.\"\n\"Our results demonstrated continued franchise momentum, in particular the asset sensitive nature of our balance sheet, focus on core deposit growth and strong credit quality. While the results of our fee income businesses were consistent with our expectations, our ongoing efforts to retool the mortgage business should accelerate its performance and bottom-line contribution going forward. In addition, the execution of synergy opportunities from the Sabadell and Gibraltar transactions should help to drive operating leverage over the balance of the year,\" Byrd added.\nByrd concluded, \"Today, we are also releasing our 2020 Strategic Goals, outlining financial metrics we intend to achieve over the coming three years. Our team is committed to providing sustainable, profitable growth and realizing outstanding returns for our shareholders.\"\nThe Company completed its acquisition of Gibraltar Private Bank & Trust on March 23, 2018, and successfully and efficiently converted branch and operating systems of Gibraltar over the weekend of March 23-25. The acquisition of Gibraltar added $1.5 billion in loans and $1.1 billion in deposits, based on preliminary purchase accounting adjustments. The Company incurred approximately $16.2 million in pre-tax merger-related expenses during the first quarter of 2018, resulting in a $0.23 reduction to GAAP EPS. Gibraltar operated eight offices in total, which will be consolidated into two offices. The Company anticipates that the operating metrics and expense savings provided at acquisition announcement will be fully achieved in 2018.\nHighlights for the first quarter of 2018 and at March 31, 2018:\nFor the quarter, both GAAP and Core EPS improved on a linked quarter basis, both of which benefited from the recent enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the prior quarter. Results were also impacted by certain non-core merger-related expenses associated with the branch and operating systems conversion of the Gibraltar acquisition. Return metrics improved significantly in the quarter, while our efficiency ratio increased slightly, reflective of traditional revenue and expense headwinds the Company experiences in the first quarter of the year.\nFor the three months ended\nGAAP\nNon-GAAP Core\n1Q18\n4Q17\n1Q18\n4Q17\nEarnings Per Common Share\n$\n1.10\n$\n0.17\n$\n1.37\n$\n1.33\nReturn on Average Assets\n0.92\n%\n0.15\n%\n1.13\n%\n1.03\n%\nReturn on Average Common Equity\n6.79\n%\n1.02\n%\n8.45\n%\n7.92\n%\nReturn on Average Tangible Common Equity\nN/A\nN/A\n13.83\n%\n12.73\n%\nEfficiency Ratio\n67.9\n%\n63.3\n%\n61.1\n%\n57.5\n%\nTangible Efficiency Ratio (TE)\nN/A\nN/A\n58.8\n%\n55.3\n%\nFirst quarter 2018 results are in-line with full year 2018 guidance. The Company's reported net interest margin was relatively unchanged on a linked quarter basis, while the Company's cash net interest margin for the quarter was 3.42%, up 9 basis points from 4Q17. Non-interest income in 1Q18 decreased $7.8 million on a linked quarter basis, primarily due to a seasonal decline in mortgage income and other fee income categories. Non-interest expense increased $6.2 million on a linked quarter basis, largely due to merger and compensation-related expenses from the Gibraltar acquisition. Total merger-related expenses in 1Q18 of $16.2 million reduced GAAP EPS by $0.23 in the current quarter. As previously announced, the Company rewarded certain associates a one-time cash bonus following the enactment of tax reform legislation in 1Q18. These bonuses impacted both GAAP and Core EPS by $0.03 in the current quarter. The effective tax rate in 1Q18 is in line with expectations at 21.6%. The reduction in the corporate tax rate effective January 1, 2018 benefited GAAP EPS by approximately $0.17 in the current quarter. Total loan growth was $1.6 billion, or 8%, in 1Q18, of which $1.5 billion was acquired from Gibraltar. Total deposits increased $1.5 billion, or 7%, in 1Q18, of which $1.1 billion was acquired from Gibraltar. Credit metrics remain stable; net charge-offs decreased $5.8 million on a linked quarter basis and equated to an annualized 9 basis points of average loans. The provision for loan losses decreased $6.4 million, or 45%.\nTable A - Summary Financial Results\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nFor the Three Months Ended\n3/31/2018\n12/31/2017\n% Change\n3/31/2017\n% Change\nGAAP BASIS:\nIncome available to common shareholders\n$\n60,023\n$\n9,329\n543.4\n$\n46,874\n28.1\nEarnings per common share - diluted\n1.10\n0.17\n547.1\n1.00\n10.0\nAverage loans and leases, net of unearned income\n$\n20,181,390\n$\n19,941,500\n1.2\n$\n15,045,755\n34.1\nAverage total deposits\n21,777,634\n21,378,122\n1.9\n17,511,324\n24.4\nNet interest margin (TE) (1)\n3.67\n%\n3.69\n%\n3.53\n%\nTotal revenues (2)\n$\n277,455\n$\n287,844\n(3.6)\n$\n217,942\n27.3\nTotal non-interest expense (2)\n188,296\n182,065\n3.4\n138,796\n35.7\nEfficiency ratio (2)\n67.9\n%\n63.3\n%\n63.7\n%\nReturn on average assets\n0.92\n0.15\n0.94\nReturn on average common equity\n6.79\n1.02\n6.41\nNON-GAAP BASIS (3) :\nCore revenues (2)\n$\n277,514\n$\n287,809\n(3.6)\n$\n217,942\n27.3\nCore non-interest expense (2)\n169,457\n165,591\n2.3\n137,215\n23.5\nCore earnings per common share - diluted\n1.37\n1.33\n3.0\n1.02\n34.3\nCore tangible efficiency ratio (TE) (1) (2) (5)\n58.8\n%\n55.3\n%\n61.3\n%\nCore return on average assets\n1.13\n1.03\n0.96\nCore return on average common equity\n8.45\n7.92\n6.55\nCore return on average tangible common equity (4)\n13.83\n12.73\n8.99\nNet interest margin (TE) - cash basis (1) (4)\n3.42\n3.33\n3.30\n(1) Fully taxable equivalent (TE) calculations include the tax benefit associated with related income sources that are tax-exempt using a rate of 35% for prior quarters and a rate of 21% for the current quarter.\n(2) Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the net presentation requirements of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which was adopted effective January 1, 2018. On average, the adoption resulted in a reduction of non-interest income and non-interest expense of approximately $2.3 million on a quarterly basis, and had no impact on net income.\n(3) See Table 7 and Table 8 for GAAP to Non-GAAP reconciliations.\n(4) See Table 6 for adjustments related to purchase discounts on acquired loans and related accretion.\n(5) Tangible calculations eliminate the effect of goodwill and acquisition related intangible assets and the corresponding amortization expense on a tax-effected basis where applicable.\nOperating Results\nThe Company's reported net interest margin decreased 2 basis points on a linked quarter basis, to 3.67%, primarily as a result of lower accretion on the acquired loan portfolio, upward repricing of indexed public funds deposits and promotional deposit pricing, offset by increases in earning assets and legacy loan yields. The Company's cash net interest margin for the quarter was 3.42%, up 9 basis points from 4Q17, driven by a recovery of interest upon payoff of a non-accrual loan and an improvement in loan yields, offset by an increase in expenses on deposits and borrowings.\nNet interest income decreased $2.6 million, or 1%, on a linked quarter basis. Average loans increased $239.9 million, or 1%, and the associated taxable-equivalent yield increased 2 basis points. All other average earning assets decreased a net of $112.4 million, or 2%, versus the prior quarter. The yield on interest earning assets was 4 basis points higher at 4.26% compared to 4.22% in the prior quarter.\nAverage interest-bearing deposits increased $297.4 million, or 2%, and the average cost of interest-bearing deposits rose 9 basis points to 74 basis points on a linked quarter basis. Total average interest-bearing liabilities remained essentially flat with the linked quarter, while the average costs of interest-bearing liabilities rose 10 basis points to 86 basis points. The total cost of interest-bearing liabilities rose primarily due to increased deposit pricing as previously discussed, and a higher rate paid on long-term FHLB advances.\nThe Company's provision for loan losses decreased 45% to $8.0 million primarily due to a decline in net charge-offs. The provision for loan losses covered net charge-offs in 1Q18 by 186% compared to 142% in 4Q17.\nIn 1Q18, non-interest income decreased $7.8 million compared to 4Q17. The primary changes in non-interest income on a linked quarter basis included a decrease in mortgage income of $4.1 million, a result of seasonal declines in mortgage production as well as a decrease in gains on sale of mortgage loans, a decrease in gains on the sale of SBA loans of $1.0 million, and an unfavorable market value adjustment on the Company's CRA mutual funds of $0.7 million. The Company is in the process of revamping its mortgage business through recent leadership changes and hiring of mortgage loan officers. The Company believes it is well-positioned in the mortgage business for the remainder of 2018.\nNon-interest expense increased $6.2 million on a linked quarter basis primarily due to higher merger-related expenses incurred in 1Q18 related to the Gibraltar acquisition. During the quarter, the Company's non-core non-interest expense included $16.2 million in merger and conversion-related expenses, $1.2 million in compensation-related expenses, and $2.1 million in branch closure and other impairment expenses.\nExcluding these items, core non-interest expense increased $3.9 million, or 2%, primarily driven by an increase in provision for unfunded lending commitments largely attributable to the reversal in 4Q17 of excess hurricane-related provisioning, increased net costs of OREO of $1.1 million related to lower gains on sales of OREO, and $1.0 million in higher donations and business development expenses.\nThe efficiency ratio increased from 63.3% to 67.9%, while the non-GAAP core tangible efficiency ratio increased from 55.3% to 58.8%, on a linked quarter basis. Refer to Table A for a summary of financial results on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.\nTable B - Summary Financial Condition Results\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nAs of and For the Three Months Ended\n3/31/2018\n12/31/2017\n% Change\n3/31/2017\n% Change\nPERIOD-END BALANCES:\nTotal loans and leases, net of unearned income\n$\n21,706,090\n$\n20,078,181\n8.1\n$\n15,132,202\n43.4\nTotal deposits\n22,971,192\n21,466,717\n7.0\n17,312,265\n32.7\nASSET QUALITY RATIOS:\nLoans 30-89 days past due and still accruing as a percentage of total loans (1)\n0.36\n%\n0.31\n%\n0.24\n%\nLoans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of total loans (1)\n0.04\n0.03\n0.05\nNon-performing assets to total assets (1)(2)\n0.64\n0.64\n1.00\nClassified assets to total assets (3)\n1.39\n1.45\n1.89\nCAPITAL RATIOS:\nTangible common equity ratio (Non-GAAP) (4) (5)\n8.66\n%\n8.61\n%\n12.10\n%\nTier 1 leverage ratio (6)\n9.97\n9.35\n12.91\nTotal risk-based capital ratio (6)\n12.48\n12.37\n16.92\nPER COMMON SHARE DATA:\nBook value\n$\n66.38\n$\n66.17\n0.3\n$\n65.25\n1.7\nTangible book value (Non-GAAP) (4) (5)\n42.91\n42.56\n0.8\n50.46\n(15.0)\nClosing stock price\n78.00\n77.50\n0.6\n79.10\n(1.4)\nCash dividends\n0.38\n0.37\n2.7\n0.36\n5.6\n(1)\nPast due and non-accrual loan amounts exclude acquired impaired loans, even if contractually past due or if the Company does not expect to receive payment in full, as the Company is currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans.\n(2)\nNon-performing assets consist of non-accruing loans, accruing loans 90 days or more past due and other real estate owned, including repossessed assets.

Excluding acquired loans, period-end loan growth during 1Q18 was strongest in the Corporate Asset Finance division (equipment financing business), the Energy Group (reserve-based lending) and the New Orleans, Louisiana market. The Company believes it is well-positioned for diversified loan growth based on our strategic presence in the South Florida, Atlanta and Texas markets, which are expected to benefit from favorable economic conditions.\nTable C - Period-End Loans\n(Dollars in thousands)\nAs of and For the Three Months Ended\nLinked Qtr Change\nYear/Year Change\nMix\n3/31/2018\n12/31/2017\n3/31/2017\n$\n%\nAnnualized\n$\n%\n3/31/2018\n12/31/2017\nLegacy loans:\nCommercial (1)\n$\n11,094,464\n$\n10,781,778\n$\n9,581,229\n312,686\n2.9\n11.8\n%\n1,513,235\n15.8\n74.4\n%\n74.5\n%\nResidential mortgage\n1,280,580\n1,176,365\n901,859\n104,215\n8.9\n35.9\n%\n378,721\n42.0\n8.6\n%\n8.1\n%\nConsumer\n2,538,878\n2,525,008\n2,440,356\n13,870\n0.5\n2.2\n%\n98,522\n4.0\n17.0\n%\n17.4\n%\nTotal legacy loans\n14,913,922\n14,483,151\n12,923,444\n430,771\n3.0\n12.1\n%\n1,990,478\n15.4\n100.0\n%\n100.0\n%\nAcquired loans:\nBalance at beginning of period\n5,595,030\n5,961,939\n2,370,047\n(366,909)\n(6.2)\n3,224,983\n136.1\nLoans acquired during the period\n1,465,319\n—\n—\n1,465,319\nN/M\n1,465,319\nN/M\nNet paydown activity\n(268,181)\n(366,909)\n(161,289)\n98,728\n(26.9)\n(106,892)\n66.3\nTotal acquired loans\n6,792,168\n5,595,030\n2,208,758\n1,197,138\n21.4\n4,583,410\n207.5\nTotal loans\n$\n21,706,090\n$\n20,078,181\n$\n15,132,202\n1,627,909\n8.1\n6,573,888\n43.4\n(1) Includes equipment financing leases.\nN/M= not meaningful\nOn an average balance and linked quarter basis, the investment portfolio decreased $94.5 million in 1Q18, to $4.8 billion, partly due to unfavorable market valuation on available for sale securities. Approximately 95% of the Company's investment portfolio is in available-for-sale securities, which experience unrealized losses as interest rates rise. On a period-end basis, the investment portfolio equated to $4.8 billion, or 16% of total assets, at March 31, 2018. The investment portfolio had an effective duration of 4.2 years and a $129.9 million unrealized loss at March 31, 2018, up from 3.7 years and a $57.2 million unrealized loss at December 31, 2017. The average yield on investment securities increased 1 basis point to 2.38% in 1Q18. The Company holds in its investment portfolio primarily government agency securities. Municipal securities comprised 9% of total investments at March 31, 2018.\nDeposits and Funding\nTotal deposits increased $1.5 billion, or 7%, to $23.0 billion at March 31, 2018, primarily driven by $1.1 billion of deposits acquired from Gibraltar. Excluding acquired deposits, deposit growth during 1Q18 was strongest in the Lake Charles, Louisiana, Naples, Florida and Mobile, Alabama markets.\nTable D - Period-End Deposits\n(Dollars in thousands)\nLinked Qtr Change\nYear/Year Change\nMix\n3/31/2018\n12/31/2017\n3/31/2017\n$\n%\nAnnualized\n$\n%\n3/31/2018\n12/31/2017\nNon-interest-bearing\n$\n6,595,495\n$\n6,209,925\n$\n5,031,583\n385,570\n6.2\n25.1\n%\n1,563,912\n31.1\n28.7\n%\n28.9\n%\nNOW accounts\n4,500,181\n4,348,939\n3,085,720\n151,242\n3.5\n14.2\n%\n1,414,461\n45.8\n19.6\n%\n20.3\n%\nMoney market accounts\n8,271,969\n7,674,291\n6,372,855\n597,678\n7.8\n31.6\n%\n1,899,114\n29.8\n36.0\n%\n35.7\n%\nSavings accounts\n874,741\n846,074\n813,009\n28,667\n3.4\n13.8\n%\n61,732\n7.6\n3.8\n%\n4.0\n%\nTime deposits\n2,728,806\n2,387,488\n2,009,098\n341,318\n14.3\n58.0\n%\n719,708\n35.8\n11.9\n%\n11.1\n%\nTotal deposits\n$\n22,971,192\n$\n21,466,717\n$\n17,312,265\n1,504,475\n7.0\n28.4\n%\n5,658,927\n32.7\n100.0\n%\n100.0\n%\nAsset Quality\nNon-performing assets (\"NPAs\") to total assets remained flat at 64 basis points on a linked quarter basis.

The Company has prepared a PowerPoint presentation that supplements information contained in this press release. The PowerPoint presentation may be accessed on the Company's web site, www.iberiabank.com , under \"Investor Relations\" and then \"Financial Information\" and \"Presentations.\"\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. The Company's management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in their analysis of the Company's performance. Non-GAAP measures in this press release include, but are not limited to, descriptions such as core, tangible, and pre-tax pre-provision. These measures typically adjust GAAP performance measures to exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles and include the tax benefit associated with revenue items that are tax-exempt, as well as adjust income available to common shareholders for certain significant activities or transactions that in management's opinion can distort period-to-period comparisons of the Company's performance. Transactions that are typically excluded from non-GAAP performance measures include realized and unrealized gains/losses on former bank owned real estate, realized gains/losses on securities, income tax gains/losses, merger-related charges and recoveries, litigation charges and recoveries, and debt repayment penalties. Management believes presentations of these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the operating results of the Company's core businesses. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP disclosures are presented in the supplemental tables at the end of this release.
