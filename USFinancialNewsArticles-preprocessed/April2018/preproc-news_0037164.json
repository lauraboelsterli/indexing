    "text": "April 17, 2018 / 7:41 PM / Updated 8 minutes ago Icahn, Deason suggest monetising Xerox assets over Fujifilm merger Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Top Xerox Corp ( XRX.N ) shareholders Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason on Tuesday suggested alternatives to the printer maker’s proposed merger with Japan’s Fujifilm ( 4901.T ), including a plan for the company to monetize some assets. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Xerox company is seen on a building in Minsk, Belarus, March 21, 2016. REUTERS/Vasily Fedosenko \nThe suggestions include removing Xerox’s current management and monetizing the company’s “untapped” intellectual property in digital printing and other businesses. \nIcahn and Deason, who control a combined 15 percent of Xerox, have been trying to stop Fujifilm from buying Xerox in a $6.1 billion deal.
