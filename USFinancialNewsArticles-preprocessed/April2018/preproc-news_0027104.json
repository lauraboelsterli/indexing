Soccer Football - Premier League - Burnley vs Leicester City - Turf Moor, Burnley, Britain - April 14, 2018 Leicester City's Jamie Vardy scores their first goal REUTERS/Russell Cheyne \nThree minutes later Burnley doubled their advantage when Kevin Long rose at the back post to head home a Johann Berg Gudmundsson corner. \nLeicester had several chances to get back into the game but twice Vardy failed to make the most of headers inside the box and Clarets keeper Nick Pope did well to keep out a powerful heaer from Riyad Mahrez. \nPope shone again after the break, getting down well to push a Vardy effort around the post as Claude Puel’s side increasingly dominated proceedings. Slideshow (3 Images) \nThe Foxes finally pulled one back when substitute Kelechi Iheanacho burst from deep and slipped a fine ball to Vardy who blasted home. \nSchmeichel had to go off injured four minutes from the end after a foul by Barnes. \nLeicester applied plenty of pressure but Burnley held on and after the game Puel appeared to concede the battle for seventh was over. \n“We deserved a result at the end. It is difficult because we lose our run for the Europa League cup, but congratulations to Burnley. They deserve it,” said the Frenchman. \n“They have been consistent in their play. There were a lot of battles in the beginning of the match. It was close but after the two goals it was surprising,” he added. \nDyche was less certain that qualification was now on the cards. \n“We’re in very good shape,” he said. “The biggest thing for me is to stay focused on what we want to do. Now it’s open-minded and see how far we can go.” Reporting by Simon Evans; Editing by Ken Ferris, Neville Dalton",
