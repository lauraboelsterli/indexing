    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Law Offices of Vincent Wong notifies investors of an investigation concerning whether Celgene Corporation (“Celgene” or the “Company”) (NASDAQGS:CELG) violated federal securities laws.\nClick here to learn about the case: http://docs.wongesq.com/CELG-Info-Request-Form-1873 . There is no cost or obligation to you.\nOn October 19, 2017, Celgene announced that it would discontinue its trials for GED-0301 and would record a $1.6 billion impairment charge because of the drug’s failure. On October 26, 2017, Celgene identified some of its key drugs that had missed sales expectations for the quarter. Then on February 27, 2018, post-market, Celgene disclosed that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) had rejected the Company’s New Drug Application (“NDA”) for Ozanimod, a multiple sclerosis treatment. Celgene stated that it had received a refusal-to-file letter from the FDA, which advised the Company that it had “determined that the nonclinical and clinical pharmacology sections in the NDA were insufficient to permit a complete review.”\nTo learn more about the investigation of Celgene contact Vincent Wong, Esq. either via email vw@wongesq.com , by telephone at 212.425.1140, or visit http://docs.wongesq.com/CELG-Info-Request-Form-1873 .\nVincent Wong, Esq. is an experienced attorney that has represented investors in securities litigations involving financial fraud and violations of shareholder rights.
