    "text": "April 11, 2018 / 7:19 PM / in 37 minutes Fashionably late: Saudi Arabia hosts its first-ever fashion week Sarah Dadouch 4 Min Read \nRIYADH (Reuters) - Fashionable women, dark-haired Saudis and blonde Eastern Europeans alike, fill the gold-trimmed halls of Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton Hotel, marking the start of Saudi Arabia’s first-ever fashion week. Women attend the Arab Fashion Week in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia April 10, 2018. Picture taken April 10, 2018. REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser \nModels and makeup artists preparing for the inaugural Saudi episode of Arab Fashion Week said they were surprised the event was taking place in the deeply conservative Muslim kingdom. \n“We are so excited because this is the first fashion week in Saudi Arabia, so we are making history,” model Anita Dmycroska said. \nStrict social restrictions have eased dramatically under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has reined in religious police, introduced public concerts and lifted bans on cinemas and women driving. \nYet, restrictions persist. Tuesday’s reception was open to men and cameras, but only women are permitted at catwalk events and outside photography is barred. \nWomen in public places in Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, wear abayas — loose-fitting, full-length robes symbolic of piety. \nWith recent reforms, women in some cities have begun to don more colorful abayas, sometimes trimmed with lace and velvet or left open to reveal long skirts or jeans.

The event hosts invitation-only fashion viewings and a Harvey Nichols pop-up store in a tent that was still being erected hours before the first show. \nAnother tent holds the catwalk, featuring designers from Brazil, Lebanon, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the United States and the United Arab Emirates. MAKING THE KINGDOM FASHIONABLE \nThe event, initially scheduled for last month, was postponed because of delays in issuing visas. Industry figures from Italy, Russia and Lebanon flocked to Riyadh, many for the first time, to admire the work of local and international designers. \nLayla Issa Abouzeid, Saudi Arabia country director for the Dubai-based Arab Fashion Council (AFC) organizing the event, said 1,500 people were expected to attend, including 400 from abroad. Slideshow (6 Images) \nShe hopes the event will bring revenue into the kingdom and highlight local talent. \n“[When] people go to Paris on the Paris Fashion week, the hotels are completely fully booked,” she said. “I want to create the same demand in Saudi Arabia, twice a year. I want to create a platform for the local designers to go worldwide.” \nLebanese designer Naja Saade came to Riyadh to display his couture collection. \n“I’m very proud to participate in this first edition of Arab Fashion Week in Saudi Arabia, because it’s a part of the revolution of the women in this country,” he said. \nBy bringing talent from Europe and placing international brands on the same catwalk as Arab brands, he hopes to elevate local fashion designers. \nAFC wants to introduce fashion courses, internships and scholarships to Saudi Arabia and develop a fashion district in Riyadh. \nJacob Abrian, AFC founder and chief executive, said many Arabs have had to leave their countries to have fashion careers, but this recurring event allows them to stay in the region. \n“I was always asking myself, why do us Arabs have to travel abroad to find our future? Why can’t we find our future in our own countries?” Reporting by Sarah Dadouch, editing by Larry King",
