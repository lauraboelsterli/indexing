(NYSE:ROP), a diversified technology company, reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nRoper reports results – including revenue, gross margin, earnings before taxes, net income, and diluted earnings per share (“DEPS”) – on both a GAAP basis and an adjusted basis.\nFirst quarter GAAP revenue increased 11% to $1.20 billion, adjusted revenue increased 9% to $1.20 billion, and organic revenue increased 6%. GAAP gross margin expanded 90 basis points to 62.4% and adjusted gross margin expanded 30 basis points to 62.5%.\nGAAP earnings before taxes grew 21% to $255 million and adjusted earnings before taxes grew 10% to $332 million. GAAP DEPS was $2.03, a 33% increase, while adjusted DEPS was $2.61, a 24% increase. Operating cash flow was $282 million, representing 23% of adjusted revenue.\n“We had a record first quarter with outstanding execution and broad-based growth across each of our segments,” said Brian Jellison, Roper’s Chairman, President, and CEO. “Our software and network businesses continued their outstanding performance with superior cash flow, while our product businesses delivered exceptional growth and strong operating leverage.”\n“Our strong cash performance and tax reform-driven repatriation allowed us to reduce debt by $535 million in the first quarter. We have now reduced leverage by $1.6 billion since December 2016. Given the positive momentum across our businesses and an improved outlook, we are raising our 2018 guidance,” concluded Mr. Jellison.\n2018 Guidance\nThe Company now expects full year Adjusted DEPS of $11.08 - $11.32, compared to previous guidance of $10.88 - $11.20.\nFor the second quarter of 2018, the Company expects Adjusted DEPS of $2.65 - $2.71.\nThe Company’s guidance excludes the impact of future acquisitions or divestitures.\nConference Call to be Held at 8:30 AM (ET) Today\nA conference call to discuss these results has been scheduled for 8:30 AM ET on Friday, April 20, 2018.
