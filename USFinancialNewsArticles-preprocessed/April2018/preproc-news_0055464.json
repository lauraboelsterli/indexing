    "text": "RIVERWOODS, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) today reported net income of $666 million or $1.82 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $564 million or $1.43 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2017. The company’s return on equity for the first quarter of 2018 was 25%.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nTotal loans grew $6.9 billion (9%) from the prior year to $82.7 billion. Credit card loans grew $5.8 billion (10%) to $65.6 billion, on Discover card sales volume of $30.9 billion. Total net charge-off rate, excluding purchased credit-impaired (\"PCI\") loans, increased 48 basis points from the prior year to 3.17% and the total 30+ day delinquency rate excluding PCI loans increased 26 basis points from the prior year to 2.23%. Consumer deposits grew $4.2 billion (11%) from the prior year to $41.3 billion. Payment Services transaction dollar volume was $56.1 billion, up 19% from the prior year.\n“Our performance this quarter was characterized by robust loan and revenue growth reflecting the strength of the Discover franchise as we continued to invest in product and service enhancements,\" said David Nelms, chairman and CEO of Discover. “I'm proud of our strong return on equity of 25%. In addition, this is the first full quarter reflecting the benefits of tax reform which, combined with share repurchases, led to a 27% year-over-year increase in earnings per share.\"\nSegment Results:\nDirect Banking\nDirect Banking pretax income of $811 million in the quarter declined by $13 million from the prior year driven by an increase in the provision for loan losses and higher operating expenses, partially offset by higher revenue.\nTotal loans ended the quarter at $82.7 billion, up 9% compared to the prior year. Credit card loans ended the quarter at $65.6 billion, up 10% from the prior year. Personal loans increased $644 million (10%) from the prior year. Private student loans increased $234 million (3%) year-over-year, and grew $727 million (11%), excluding purchased student loans.\nNet interest income increased $208 million (11%) from the prior year, driven by loan growth and a higher net interest margin. Net interest margin was 10.23%, up 16 basis points from the prior year. Card yield was 12.85%, an increase of 20 basis points from the prior year as a result of increases in the prime rate, partially offset by a change in portfolio mix and higher interest charge-offs. Interest expense as a percent of total loans increased 23 basis points from the prior year, primarily as a result of higher market rates.\nOther income increased $19 million (5%) from the prior year, driven by higher discount and interchange revenue.\nThe delinquency rate for credit card loans 30+ days past due was 2.33%, up 27 basis points from the prior year and 5 basis points from the prior quarter. The credit card net charge-off rate for the first quarter was 3.32%, up 48 basis points from the prior year and 29 basis points from the prior quarter. The student loan net charge-off rate, excluding PCI loans, was 1.17%, up 34 basis points from the prior year. The personal loans net charge-off rate of 4.03% increased by 87 basis points from the prior year. Net charge-off rates were generally higher because of supply-driven credit normalization and the seasoning of loan growth from the last few years.\nProvision for loan losses of $751 million increased $157 million from the prior year due to higher net charge-offs and a higher reserve build. The reserve build for the first quarter of 2018 was $116 million, compared to a reserve build of $107 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nExpenses increased $83 million from the prior year as a result of higher employee compensation and marketing expenses. Additionally, we expanded investments to build financial literacy, support diversity and inclusion, and strengthen the communities in which we operate. Employee compensation increased as a result of higher staffing levels and higher average salaries. Marketing expenses increased as a result of higher account acquisition costs and brand advertising.\nPayment Services\nPayment Services pretax income was $45 million in the quarter, up $1 million from the prior year, primarily driven by higher transaction processing and interchange revenue offset by a reserve release in the first quarter of 2017.\nPayment Services transaction dollar volume was $56.1 billion, up 19% versus the prior year. PULSE transaction dollar volume was up 20% year-over-year primarily driven by merchant and acquirer routing decisions. Diners Club volume increased 14% year-over-year driven by continued strength of newer franchise relationships. Network Partners volume increased by 24% from the prior year driven by AribaPay.\nShare Repurchases\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the company repurchased approximately 7.5 million shares of common stock for $584 million. Shares of common stock outstanding declined by 1.8% from the prior quarter.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nThe company will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter results on Thursday, April 26, 2018, at 4:00 p.m. Central time. Interested parties can listen to the conference call via a live audio webcast at https://investorrelations.discover.com .\nAbout Discover\nDiscover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) is a direct banking and payment services company with one of the most recognized brands in U.S. financial services.

These loans were initially recorded at fair value and accrete interest income over the estimated lives of the loans as long as cash flows are reasonably estimable, even if the loans are contractually past due. PCI loans are private student loans and are included in total loan receivables.\n3 Excludes PCI loans (described above) which are accounted for on a pooled basis. Since a pool is accounted for as a single asset with a single composite interest rate and aggregate expectation of cash flows, the past-due status of a pool, or that of the individual loans within a pool, is not meaningful. Because the Company is recognizing interest income on a pool of loans, it is all considered to be performing.\n4 Allowance for loan loss includes the net change in reserves on PCI pools having no remaining non-accretable difference which does not impact the reserve change build/(release) in provision for loan losses.\n5 Volume is derived from data provided by licensees for Diners Club branded cards issued outside of North America and is subject to subsequent revision or amendment.\nNote: See Glossary for definitions of financial terms in the financial supplement which is available online at the SEC's website ( http://www.sec.gov ) and the Company's website ( http://investorrelations.discoverfinancial.com ).\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180426006826/en/\nDiscover Financial Services\nInvestors:\nCraig Streem, 224-405-5923\ncraigstreem@discover.com\nor\nMedia:\nJon Drummond, 224-405-1888\njondrummond@discover.com\nSource: Discover Financial Services",
