    "text": "MILAN (Reuters) - Sky’s ( SKYB.L ) Italian unit said on Monday a Milan court had suspended the tender for TV rights of Italy’s top flight Serie A soccer matches put on sale by Spain’s Mediapro until May 4. \n\nSky logo is seen at the exterior of the Sky Italia buildings on the outskirts of Milan, Italy, April 27, 2016. REUTERS/ Stefano Rellandini Italy’s Serie A soccer league in February accepted an offer for the rights to air matches for the 2018-21 seasons by Spanish broker Mediapro at just above 1.05 billion euros ($1.30 billion). \nOffers from broadcasters interested in buying the rights were initially expected by April 21. \nSky Italia said it had requested a Milan-based court to verify whether Mediapro’s tender respected Italian laws. \n“The tender by Mediapro... rises so many perplexities, making it necessary to verify its legality before presenting any important offers,” Sky Italia added in the statement. \nReporting by Elvira Pollina; writing by Giulia Segreti\n ",
