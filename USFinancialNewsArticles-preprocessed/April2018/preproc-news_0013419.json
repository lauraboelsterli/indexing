Photo: Amber Bracken for The Wall Street Journal FORT MCMURRAY, Canada—A rift between two Canadian provinces is threatening to derail a pipeline expansion that would nearly triple the amount of crude flowing from this town in northeastern Alberta, most of it toward Asian markets.\nKinder Morgan Canada Ltd. said on Sunday it would scrap the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline if Canada’s federal and provincial governments couldn’t resolve their differences by May 31, raising pressure on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to intervene on behalf of a project that has big implications for world oil markets.\nThe pipeline expansion has hit stiff opposition in British Columbia where environmentalists and lawmakers say it puts the Pacific coastline at risk. That has infuriated many in Alberta, the sprawling Western province that is home to 97% of Canada’s oil reserves.\nNowhere are the stakes higher than in Fort McMurray, a town so embedded in the oil sands that a heavy, black form of the crude called bitumen sometimes bubbles to the surface of the roads in the summertime.\nRobbie Picard, a nightclub owner, has become a vocal defender of expanding the pipeline. Photo: Amber Bracken for The Wall Street Journal “My sympathy for British Columbia is zero,” said Robbie Picard, a nightclub owner who came to Fort McMurray during an oil boom more than a decade ago to build a new life.\nThe expansion would increase the crude flowing through the pipeline to 890,000 barrels a day and make Canada a big global competitor in China and India, where appetite is surging. U.S. producers have logged major oil sales in China since they started exporting there two years ago, but Asian refineries prefer Canada’s heavier crude to the lighter U.S. variety, says Mike Walls, an analyst with commodity and energy data company Genscape.\nCanada houses the third-largest proven oil reserves in the world after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, but most of it is trapped in land-locked Alberta. The oil is found in a thick mixture of sand, water and bitumen, a form of crude that resembles asphalt. Recent attempts to funnel oil to coastal ports have stalled amid opposition.\nDon Scott is mayor of the regional municipality that includes Fort McMurray. When the region was booming from high oil prices, the community widened highways and built one of the country’s largest community centers. Photo: Amber Bracken for The Wall Street Journal “This pipeline is in the national interest and will get built,” Mr. Trudeau said, during a tour Friday of an oil-sands mine in Alberta.\nBut Mr. Trudeau, who approved the expansion in 2016, hasn’t yet thrown the federal government’s legal might behind the project, such as invoking a little-used constitutional power to ensure the project gets built. If he does, he risks alienating environmentally-conscious voters, especially in British Columbia, the country’s third-largest province that helped propel his Liberal Party to power.\nOn Monday, Mr. Trudeau said officials were reviewing a range of options aimed at saving the Trans Mountain expansion, without elaborating.\nParallel Proposal The proposed expansion to the Trans Mountain pipeline would nearly triple its capacity.

The city of Burnaby, which has sued to halt construction on a marine terminal at the end of the pipeline, recently vowed to take its case to the Supreme Court.\nThe onslaught of court cases, as well as British Columbia’s vocal opposition to the project prompted Kinder Morgan to issue its ultimatum, said Steven Kean, president of Houston-based Kinder Morgan Inc., which is the majority owner of Kinder Morgan Canada. \n“We can’t build a project in the courthouse,” he said Monday.\nOpposition to the pipeline’s expansion has been building since last year, when the New Democratic Party’s John Horgan became leader of British Columbia and promised to block it in court. Opponents have ramped up protests, saying the expanded pipeline will contribute to climate change. They say the economic benefit isn’t worth the added risk of an oil spill that would damage the marine life and coastal land the province’s fisheries and tourism industries depend on.\n“We cannot build new fossil fuel infrastructure to lock in decades of more pollution,” said Peter McCartney, climate change policy leader for the Wilderness Committee, a Vancouver-based environmental group. He said he expects protests to continue even if courts rule in favor of the pipeline.\nMr. Horgan responded to Kinder Morgan’s ultimatum on Sunday. “The risk is too great,” he said. “I will not give up the right and responsibilities of the government of British Columbia to defend the rights and interests of British Columbians.”\nOpposition to the pipeline has infuriated many in Alberta. The province’s leader, Rachel Notley, said on Sunday her government would soon introduce legislation allowing it to retaliate economically against its neighbor. In the past, Alberta has threatened to restrict the flow of oil and gas to rest of the country if Mr. Horgan’s government continues to “launch frivolous lawsuits and wage a war of attrition against the pipeline.\"\nMost of Canada’s oil reserves are trapped in landlocked Alberta. The Trans Mountain expansion would nearly triple the amount of crude flowing from Fort McMurray. Photo: Amber Bracken for The Wall Street Journal Fort McMurray’s residents are acutely aware of the stakes. The town boomed between 2005 and 2014 when oil prices spiked to more than $100 a barrel and companies swarmed in to take a stake in the oil sands. The province and the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, which includes the town, widened highways, put up bridges and built one of Canada’s largest community recreation and social centers.\nAfter oil prices crashed in 2014, companies such as Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Norway’s Statoil AS A, and ConocoPhillips sold assets. Wildfires devastated the region in 2016, and the town’s population has dropped by roughly 10% since to around 72,000, according to the office of Mayor Don Scott.\nGene Ouellette had to close his business selling snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles. ‘He’s slapped us in the face,’ he said of Mr. Trudeau. Photo: Amber Bracken for The Wall Street Journal Fort McMurray resident Gene Ouellette said he is disappointed Mr. Trudeau hasn’t more forcefully intervened in the dispute. He had a thriving business selling snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles during the oil boom but closed it this year after sales fell.\n“I’m extremely discouraged” with Trudeau’s leadership, said Mr. Ouellette. “He’s slapped us in the face.”\nMr. Trudeau is also under fire from constituents in British Columbia. At a recent town hall meeting near Vancouver, some protesters jeered the prime minister, and one brandished a sign that said, “Climate leaders don’t build pipelines.”\nThe federal government carried out a review of the economic and environmental questions before approving the pipeline, said Jim Carr, the federal Minister of Natural Resources. “I don’t think we’ve been passive.”\nTwo pipeline projects have already been scrapped this decade due to local opposition in other areas of the country: Enbridge Inc.’s Northern Gateway pipeline, meant to carry Alberta crude to the Pacific coast; and TransCanada Corp.’s Energy East corridor, linking Alberta to the Atlantic coast.\nThat means Canada is dependent on a single customer: the U.S., with only a few pipelines going south. That leaves the industry vulnerable to disruption, such as the leak last November in TransCanada Corp.’s Keystone Pipeline, which caused oil shipments to pile up at terminals and suppressed prices.\nAs the debate has intensified, Mr. Picard has become one of Fort McMurray’s more vocal oil-sands defenders. He travels to speak at pro-pipeline rallies and sells t-shirts with the logo “Oil Sands Strong” on them.\nA frozen tailings pond north of Fort McMurray. ‘Alberta is a dirty little secret for the rest of the country,’ said Mr. Picard. Photo: Amber Bracken for The Wall Street Journal “Alberta is a dirty secret for the rest of the country,” he said. “People don’t want to admit it pays for schools in Ontario and Quebec. Trudeau could sell it better.”\nWrite to Vipal Monga at vipal.monga@wsj.com and Paul Vieira at paul.vieira@wsj.com",
