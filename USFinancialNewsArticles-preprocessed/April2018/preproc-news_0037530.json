REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne \nBeijing banned imports of beef from European countries and the United States following outbreaks of mad cow disease in the 1990s but worries about the disease are subsiding following more stringent inspections on foreign arrivals. \nIreland succeeded in getting its curbs lifted alongside the United States and South Africa last year following years of lobbying. China started inspections of Irish meat export facilities in 2014. \n“I understand that the Chinese authorities will list a number of our beef establishments within the next few days,” Irish Agriculture Minister Michael Creed said in a statement. \nThe approval gives Ireland access to the world’s fastest-growing beef market and second largest importer for the first time and a spokesman for the agriculture department said five other Irish beef plants were awaiting approval. \nDemand for red meat in China, the world’s second-largest economy, has risen strongly in recent years due to rising incomes and a richer diet. \nChina is already Ireland’s third largest market for agricultural exports, increasing roughly five-fold to 1 billion euros (£866.3 million) last year from around 200 million euros in 2010, and the second largest for dairy and pork products. \nIrish beef is one of the sectors most vulnerable to the potential effects of Brexit. Ireland is widely considered the EU member most at risk when Britain leaves the bloc due to its close trading links with its nearest neighbour. \n“Opening and developing new markets is also a key part of our response to the uncertainties arising from Brexit,” Creed added.
