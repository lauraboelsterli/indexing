    "text": "TORONTO, April 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - theScore, Inc. (TSX Venture: SCR) (\"theScore\") today announced the financial results for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\").\nIn Q2 F2018 the Company achieved revenue of $7.1M versus $6.7M for the same period the previous year. Revenue for the first six months of F2018 was $15.5M versus $15.2M for the same period in F2017. Q2 F2018 growth was accomplished thanks to strong performances from theScore's Canadian direct sales and US programmatic businesses. EBITDA loss improved to $0.5M in Q2 F2018, versus a loss of $1.4M in Q2 F2017.\ntheScore app on iOS continued to show positive growth this quarter. For Q2 F2018, monthly active users of theScore app on iPhone and iPad were up by 9% for the same period the previous year. This was offset by lower monthly active users of theScore app on Android.\nAs a result, total average monthly active users of theScore app for Q2 F2018 were 4.1M, consistent with the same period in the previous year. Average monthly app sessions-per-user were 85 versus 89 for Q2 F2017.\n\"Our revenue numbers and the continued user growth on iOS in such a competitive app market were extremely positive this quarter,\" said John Levy, CEO and Founder of theScore. \"Clearly Android remains the primary challenge that's affecting our overall app user growth, but we're tackling these industry-wide challenges through a combination of strategic product and marketing initiatives.\"\nIn Q2 F2018, theScore esports recorded more than 20M video views, up from 6.5M for the same period the previous year. theScore's social channels continued to serve as a strong brand-building tactic, reaching in excess an average of 30 million people a month during Q2, while other highlights included the Company's chatbot for Facebook Messenger crossing 500K average monthly active users for the first time.\n\"While our flagship app is our core business and primary focus, we saw continued growth across other areas of our operations, including our emerging platforms, esports and social teams,\" added Mr. Levy. \"We believe there are exciting growth opportunities here, which in turn could serve as both brand-building tactics and, eventually, potentially become monetizable businesses themselves.\"\nFor more details, please join theScore's conference call at 8:30am EST on Thursday, April 12 where management will review the Company's Q2 F2018 results, followed by a question and answer session.\nConference Call Dial-In Numbers\nToronto: (+1) 416 764 8688\nToll Free North America: (+1) 888 390 0546\nInstant Replay\nToronto: (+1) 416 764 8677\nToll Free: North America (+1) 888 390 0541\nPlayback Passcode: 010935 #\nThe conference call will also be webcast live here .\ntheScore Investor Relations\ntheScore.com\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nAbout theScore Inc.\ntheScore's mission is to create highly-engaging digital products and content that empower the sports fan's experience.
