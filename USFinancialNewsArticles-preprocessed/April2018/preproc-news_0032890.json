Baird in Milwaukee.\n“Expectations have set a high bar for earnings and if companies are able to get over that, they will be rewarded. But an inability to get enough above that, you might see some negative reactions.”\nAnalysts expect profits of S&P 500 companies to rise 18.6 percent in the first quarter, the biggest increase in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nAt 11:33 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.05 percent at 24,830.11. The S&P 500 gained 1.1 percent to 2,706.4 and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.62 percent to 7,272.30.\nAt their session highs, all three indexes were above their 50-day moving averages.\nData on Tuesday showed U.S. homebuilding increased more than expected in March amid a rebound in the construction of multi-family housing units. The PHLX housing index rose 1.3 percent.\nAll the 11 major S&P sectors were higher, led by the technology index’s 1.91 percent gain. The consumer discretionary index rose 1.7 percent, boosted by Netflix and Amazon, which gained 2.7 percent.\nAmazon.com is in talks with Brazilian airline Azul on shipping goods in the country, Latin America’s largest economy, Reuters reported.\nGoldman Sachs reversed course to drop 0.9 percent, mirroring other big U.S. banks that declined despite beating Wall Street’s profit expectations.\nJ&J fell 1.8 percent, erasing premarket gains after the company reported a better-than-expected profit and raised its full-year sales forecast.\nThe earnings season has helped divert attention from geopolitical and trade concerns, which have roiled the markets in recent months.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE for a 3.23-to-1 ratio, and on the Nasdaq, for a 2.98-to-1 ratio.
