    "text": "LACEY, Wash., April 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Anchor Bancorp (NASDAQ:ANCB) (“Company”), the holding company for Anchor Bank (“Bank”), today reported third quarter earnings for its fiscal year ending June 30, 2018. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported a net income of $1.4 million or $0.57 per diluted share, compared to net income of $702,000 or $0.29 per diluted share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the nine months ended March 31, 2018, the Company reported net income of $1.0 million or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.7 million or $0.70 per diluted share for the same period last year. The lower net income for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the same period in the previous year was the result of a one-time revaluation adjustment to the Company's deferred tax asset to account for the future impact of lower corporate tax rates as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted on December 22, 2017. The tax revaluation resulted in a $2.4 million increase in the Company's income tax expense and a ($0.96) reduction in earnings per diluted share for the fiscal second quarter.\n\"Our earnings increased this quarter as a result of the growth in our loan portfolio as well as our continuing focus on reducing noninterest expense,\" stated Jerald L. Shaw, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Our ongoing efforts to increase retail deposits is reflected by the $15.0 million increase in these deposits from June 30, 2017, of which $7.1 million are demand deposits. We also eliminated a large real estate owned property this quarter, realizing a significant gain.\" stated Mr. Shaw.\nFiscal Third Quarter Highlights\nLoans receivable, net, increased $20.7 million, or 5.5%, to $398.6 million at March 31, 2018 from $377.9 million at June 30, 2017; Net interest income before provision for loan losses increased $427,000, or 10.2%, to $4.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $4.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017; The efficiency ratio improved to 67.3% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from 82.9% at June 30, 2017 and from 78.2% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017; Net interest margin (\"NIM\") was 4.28% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 4.10% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017; and Allowance for losses as a percent of nonperforming loans increased to 365.1% from 110.8% at June 30, 2017.\nBalance Sheet Review\nTotal assets increased by $17.7 million, or 3.8%, to $480.2 million at March 31, 2018 from $462.5 million at June 30, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $6.1 million, or 42.8%, to $20.3 million at March 31, 2018, from $14.2 million at June 30, 2017. Securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity decreased $2.5 million, or 11.6%, and $1.2 million or 24.4%, respectively. The decreases in these portfolios were primarily the result of contractual principal repayments.\nLoans receivable, net, increased $20.7 million, or 5.5%, to $398.6 million at March 31, 2018 from $377.9 million at June 30, 2017 due primarily to increases in construction loans and, to a lesser extent, one-to-four family loans. Construction loans increased $36.1 million, or 73.4%, to $85.2 million at March 31, 2018 from $49.2 million at June 30, 2017. There was $36.7 million in undisbursed construction loan commitments at March 31. 2018. Our construction loans are primarily for the construction of multi-family properties and to a lesser extent, loans for the construction of single family and commercial properties. One-to-four family loans increased $3.1 million, or 5.1%, to $62.8 million at March 31, 2018 from $59.7 million at June 30, 2017. All other loan categories decreased. Commercial business loans decreased $11.0 million, or 34.9%, to $20.6 million at March 31, 2018 from $31.6 million at June 30, 2017 primarily related to the payoff of a $9.0 million participation loan. Commercial real estate loans decreased $2.6 million, or 1.7%, to $152.9 million at December 31, 2017 from $155.5 million at June 30, 2017. We also reclassified a $2.0 million multi-tenant commercial real estate loan to real estate owned (\"REO\") and recorded during the nine months ended March 31, 2018 a $200,000 charge upon transfer to reflect its fair market value. Land loans decreased $1.8 million, or 22.6%, to $6.2 million at March 31, 2018 from $8.1 million at June 30, 2017. Multi-family loans decreased $1.6 million, or 2.7%, to $58.9 million at March 31, 2018 from $60.5 million at June 30, 2017.

The increase in certificates of deposit accounts was the result of the Bank's deposit marketing campaign, as well as other deposit gathering activities.\nDeposits consisted of the following at the dates indicated:\nMarch 31, 2018 June 30, 2017 March 31, 2017 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Noninterest-bearing demand deposits $ 57,767 16.0 % $ 52,606 15.2 % $ 57,732 16.8 % Interest-bearing demand deposits 33,446 9.3 31,464 9.1 29,863 8.7 Money market accounts 64,344 17.9 73,154 21.2 84,105 24.5 Savings deposits 45,052 12.5 43,454 12.6 44,558 13.0 Certificates of deposit 159,610 44.3 144,509 41.9 127,007 37.0 Total deposits $ 360,219 100.0 % $ 345,187 100.0 % $ 343,265 100.0 % Credit Quality\nTotal delinquent loans (past due 30 days or more), decreased $2.8 million to $1.3 million at March 31, 2018 from $4.1 million at June 30, 2017, primarily due to the transfer of the $2.0 million commercial real estate loan discussed above to REO at a fair market value of $1.8 million. The percentage of nonperforming loans, consisting solely of nonaccrual loans, to total loans decreased to 0.3% at March 31, 2018 from 1.0% at June 30, 2017. The Company recorded a $120,000 provision for loan losses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 due to loan growth. The allowance for loan losses of $4.3 million at March 31, 2018 represented 1.1% of total loans and 365.1% of nonperforming loans. This compares to an allowance of $4.1 million at June 30, 2017, representing 1.1% of total loans and 110.8% of nonperforming loans.\nNonperforming loans decreased to $1.2 million at March 31, 2018, from $3.7 million at June 30, 2017, and were $2.4 million at March 31, 2017. Nonperforming loans consisted of the following at the dates indicated:\nMarch 31, 2018 June 30, 2017 March 31, 2017 (In thousands) Real estate: One-to-four family $ 682 $ 1,170 $ 2,059 Commercial — 1,992 202 Total real estate 682 3,162 2,261 Consumer: Home equity 216 242 22 Total consumer 216 242 22 Business: Commercial business 268 300 82 Total $ 1,166 $ 3,704 $ 2,365 As of March 31, 2018, the Company had two REO properties with an aggregate book value of $737,000 compared to three properties with an aggregate book value of $867,000 at June 30, 2017, and two properties with an aggregate book value of $220,000 at March 31, 2017. During the quarter ended March 31, 2018 we sold the $2.0 million reclassified commercial real estate loan discussed above for $3.0 million, resulting in a gain on sale of $163,000, net of capital improvements incurred subsequent to its transfer to REO.\nCapital\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Bank was considered \"well capitalized\" in accordance with its regulatory capital guidelines and exceeded all regulatory capital requirements with Tier 1 Leverage-Based Capital, Common Equity Tier 1 Capital (\"CET1\"), Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital, and Total Risk-Based Capital ratios of 13.2%, 14.7%, 14.7%, and 15.8% respectively.

Net interest income before the provision for loan losses increased $427,000, or 10.2%, to $4.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $4.2 million for the same period last year primarily due to the increase in average loans receivable, net. Average loans receivable, net, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased $28.1 million, or 7.5%, to $402.1 million compared to $374.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nThe Company's net interest margin was 4.28% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 4.10% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The average yield on loans receivable, net, increased 29 basis points to 5.49% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 5.20% for the same period of the prior year, reflecting the increase in high yield construction loans. The average yield on mortgage-backed securities increased to 2.06% from 1.98% for the same period in the prior year primarily due to a decrease of large principal pay downs resulting in an increase in amortization of premiums. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 34 basis points to 5.26% from 4.92% for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The average cost of total deposits increased 13 basis points to 1.14% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 1.01% for the same period in the prior year. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 19 basis points to 1.22% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 1.03% for the same period in the prior year, reflecting the increases in both FHLB advances and in the federal funds rate over the last year. Net interest income before the provision for loan losses increased $1.1 million, or 9.1%, to $13.5 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $12.4 million for the same period last year primarily due to the increase in average loans receivable, net over the last year. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 22 basis points to 5.16% for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 4.94% for the same period in the prior year primarily due to the increase in the average yield on loans receivable, net. The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 16 basis points to 1.17% for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 1.01% for the same period of the prior year, for the reasons stated above.\nProvision for loan losses . In connection with its analysis of the loan portfolio, management determined that a $120,000 provision for loan losses was required for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $135,000 for the same period last year, primarily reflecting our recent loan growth. Provision for loan losses for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 was $300,000 compared to $285,000 for the same period last year.\nNoninterest income . Noninterest income decreased $103,000, or 10.1%, to $920,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $1.0 million for the same period in the previous year. The decrease in noninterest income is primarily attributable to the $88,000, or 44.2%, decrease in other income in the quarter ended March 31, 2018 to $111,000 compared to $199,000 for the same quarter a year ago primarily due to no loan prepayment penalties in the current quarter. Noninterest income decreased $83,000, or 2.6%, to $3.1 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2018 which was primarily due to a decrease in deposit fees of $159,000 as consumers reduced their deposit account overdrafts which was partially offset by an increase of $46,000 from gain on sale of loans due to an increase in loans sold.\nNoninterest expense . Noninterest expense decreased $346,000, or 8.5%, to $3.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from $4.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Gain on sale of REO increased $143,000 to $163,000 from $20,000 in the same quarter in the previous year. General and administrative expenses declined $140,000 to $514,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to $654,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. This decrease was mainly due to no unfunded loan reserve commitment expense during the current quarter compared to a $75,000 unfunded loan reserve commitment expense in the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and $15,000 reductions in both accounting fees and contribution expense between the periods. Compensation and benefits expense decreased $78,000, or 3.6%, to $2.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from $2.2 million for the same period in the previous year. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction of employee compensation of $130,000 to $1.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from $1.3 million in the same quarter in the previous year. Also, stock-based compensation expense related to the Anchor Bancorp 2015 Equity Plan decreased $120,000 to $12,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from $132,000 for the same quarter last year and incentive loan commission decreased $75,000 to $55,000 from $130,000 for the same quarter last year. These decreases were partially offset by $180,000 for retention bonuses paid this quarter associated with the pending merger with Washington Federal, Inc. Noninterest expense decreased $1.2 million, or 9.1%, to $11.6 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $12.8 million for the same period in 2017 primarily due to a $563,000 decrease in general and administrative expense and a $379,000 decline in compensation and benefits expenses.\nAbout the Company\nAnchor Bancorp is headquartered in Lacey, Washington and is the parent company of Anchor Bank, a community-based savings bank primarily serving Western Washington through its 10 full-service banking offices (including one Wal-Mart in-store location) within Grays Harbor, Thurston, Lewis, Pierce and Mason counties, and one loan production office located in King County, Washington.
