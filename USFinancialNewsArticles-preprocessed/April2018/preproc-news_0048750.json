    "text": "April 23, 2018 / 6:38 PM / Updated 7 minutes ago At least two dead, seven hurt by van ploughing over Toronto sidewalk Anna Mehler Paperny , Allison Martell 4 Min Read \nTORONTO (Reuters) - A white van killed at least two people and injured seven when its driver ploughed through a busy Toronto sidewalk on a sunny Monday afternoon, according to police, hospital officials and a Reuters witness. \nThe incident occurred just before 1:30 p.m. (1730 GMT) as large crowds of office workers were on lunch breaks. At least one witness described the driver as appearing to deliberately target victims on his roughly mile-long (1.6 km-long) rampage. The driver was in custody, police said. \nPolice in Canada’s largest city initially said eight to 10 people had been injured but later said it was unclear exactly how many had been hurt or the extent of their injuries. \nA Reuters witness said there were at least two bodies at the site of the incident. At least seven people were brought to nearby Sunnybrook Health Services Centre’s trauma centre, the hospital said on Twitter. \nIt was not immediately clear if the incident was a deliberate act by the driver or a traffic mishap in a mixed commercial and residential area. \nCanada’s public safety minister, Ralph Goodale, told a news conference there had been casualties but provided no further details. \n“The investigation is at a stage where no further information can be confirmed at this point,” Goodale said. “The police are conducting obviously their thorough investigation to determine what happened and why it happened, the motivations involved.” \nThere have been a string of deadly vehicle attacks in the United States and Europe, including an Oct. 31 attack in New York that killed eight. Toronto is hosting a Group of Seven foreign ministers meeting about 30 kms (18 miles) away. \nThe crash occurred at the corner of Yonge Street and Finch Avenue in the north end of the city, where a van drove onto the sidewalk and hit several people, said Toronto Police spokeswoman Meaghan Gray. Toronto police investigates an incident where a van struck multiple people at a major intersection in Toronto's northern suburbs in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, April 23, 2018. REUTERS/Chris Donovan \nA man who gave his name as Ali told CNN he saw the van and that the driver appeared to have been targeting people. \n“This person was intentionally doing this, he was killing everybody,” the man said. “He kept going, he kept going. People were getting hit, one after another.” \nHe said a number of the victims were older people and at one point he saw a stroller fly into the air. \nAt least one person was struck outside on the sidewalk outside an Anglican church, north of where the van came to rest in front of a currency exchange in a condominium tower. \nBuildings and workplaces in the area where the van struck pedestrians in Toronto were locked down, and a nearby subway station was closed and service suspended. \nYonge Street is large, divided boulevard at the point where the incident occurred, its centre meridian dotted with planter boxes and sculptures. \nSome of the victims were struck in a public square popular with office workers on lunch breaks. Aerial photos of the scene posted on social media showed a food truck parked just a few feet away from where emergency workers busily transferred people onto stretchers.
