The quarter included not only the impact of the 2017 tax cuts but also the increased number of shares as a result of our capital raise that we completed in February,\" said Mark A. Klein, Chairman, President and CEO of SB Financial. Operating results included a strong SBA quarter, 13 percent year-over-year loan growth and improved asset quality metrics.\"\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Revenue\nTotal operating revenue, consisting of net interest income and noninterest income, was up 15.9 percent from the first quarter of 2017, and up 1.7 percent from the linked quarter.\nNet interest income was up 18.3 percent from the year-ago quarter, and up 0.6 percent from the linked quarter. Net interest margin (FTE) was up 27 basis points from the year-ago quarter, but down 10 basis points from the linked quarter. The year-over-year increase was due to higher loan volume, and higher earning asset yields. Noninterest income was up 11.6 percent from the year-ago quarter, and up 3.7 percent from the linked quarter.\nMortgage Loan Business\nMortgage loan originations for the first quarter of 2018 were $58.5 million, up $1.8 million, or 3.2 percent, from the year-ago quarter. Total sales of originated loans were $40.6 million, down $9.9 million, or 19.6 percent from the year-ago quarter.\nNet mortgage banking income, consisting of gains on the sale of mortgage loans and net loan servicing fees, was $1.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $1.6 million for the year-ago quarter. The mortgage servicing valuation adjustment for the first quarter 2018 was a positive $0.09 million, compared to a positive adjustment of $0.03 million for the first quarter of 2017. The aggregate servicing valuation impairment ended the quarter at $0.2 million. The mortgage servicing portfolio at March 31, 2018, was $1.00 billion, up $0.09 billion, or 9.5 percent, from $0.92 billion at March 31, 2017.\nMr. Klein noted, \"We continue to see the mortgage origination business constrained by limited housing inventory in all of our markets. We are encouraged, however, by the significant increase in our pipeline late in the quarter.\"\nMortgage Banking ($000's)\nMar. 2018\nDec. 2017\nSep. 2017\nJun. 2017\nMar. 2017\nMortgage originations\n$ 58,485\n$ 72,102\n$ 89,217\n$ 97,804\n$ 56,667\nMortgage sales\n40,589\n53,825\n76,919\n80,038\n50,473\nMortgage servicing portfolio\n1,004,728\n994,915\n979,251\n952,364\n917,435\nMortgage servicing rights\n10,195\n9,907\n9,560\n9,217\n8,727\nMortgage servicing revenue:\nLoan servicing fees\n625\n617\n605\n583\n566\nOMSR amortization\n(246)\n(269)\n(343)\n(303)\n(218)\nNet administrative fees\n379\n348\n262\n280\n348\nOMSR valuation adjustment\n92\n117\n(35)\n(39)\n35\nNet loan servicing fees\n471\n465\n227\n241\n383\nGain on sale of mortgages\n1,100\n1,608\n2,211\n2,063\n1,250\nMortgage banking revenue, net\n$1,571\n$2,073\n$2,438\n$2,304\n$1,633\nNoninterest Income and Noninterest Expense\nSB Financial's noninterest income includes revenue from a diverse group of services, such as wealth management, deposit fees, residential loan sales and the sale of Small Business Administration loans (SBA). SBA activity for the quarter was significant, with total loan volume of $10.6 million and gains of $0.6 million. Wealth management assets under the Company's care stood at $411.7 million as of March 31, 2018. For the first quarter of 2018, noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 35.5 percent. The recapture of mortgage servicing rights positively impacted the quarter by $0.09 million. The Company completed the sale of our item processing division, DCM, in the quarter, resulting in total revenue of $0.4 million, slightly above the prior year.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, noninterest expense (NIE) of $8.6 million, was up $1.2 million, or 16.9 percent, compared to the same quarter last year. In the quarter, we had higher commission for SBA sales, (of $0.1 million) expenses related to the sale of DCM (of $0.2 million) and several of the previously announced tax initiatives (of $0.2 million). Compared to the linked quarter, NIE was up $0.5 million, or 6.4 percent.\nMr. Klein stated, \"We sold several large SBA credits in the quarter that had been in process for some time, this resulted in our largest SBA production quarter since we expanded this business line in 2014. The sale of DCM, while immaterial to our results, allows our team to focus on our core banking competencies. Expenses were also higher but we were proud to share some of our tax savings with our staff and communities.\"\nNoninterest Income / Noninterest Expense\n($000's)\nMar. 2018\nDec. 2017\nSep. 2017\nJun. 2017\nMar. 2017\nNoninterest Income (NII)\n$ 4,243\n$ 4,092\n$ 4,861\n$ 4,462\n$ 3,802\nNII / Total Revenue\n35.5%\n34.8%\n40.1%\n39.1%\n36.9%\nNII / Average Assets\n1.9%\n1.9%\n2.3%\n2.1%\n1.8%\nNoninterest Expense (NIE)\n$ 8,627\n$ 8,106\n$ 8,284\n$ 7,806\n$ 7,382\nEfficiency Ratio\n72.2%\n69.0%\n68.3%\n68.3%\n71.6%\nNIE / Average Assets\n3.8%\n3.7%\n3.9%\n3.7%\n3.6%\nNet Noninterest Expense\n(1.9)\n(1.8)\n(1.6)\n(1.6)\n(1.7)\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets as of March 31, 2018, were $925.6 million, up $78.8 million, or 9.3 percent, from a year ago. Total equity as of March 31, 2018, was $122.9 million, up 39.7 percent, from a year ago, and accounted for 13.3 percent of total assets. Both the equity and total assets reflect the $30 million common capital raise completed in the quarter.\nTotal loans held for investment were $707.2 million at March 31, 2018, up $80.5 million, or 12.8 percent, from March 31, 2017. Commercial real estate loans were up $55.6 million, or 19.7 percent, and accounted for the majority of the total loan growth, while residential real estate also rose $15.1 million or 11.0 percent.\nThe investment portfolio of $95.7 million, including Federal Reserve Bank and Federal Home Loan Bank stock, represented 10.3 percent of assets at March 31, 2018, and was down 14.3 percent from the year-ago period. Deposit balances of $748.8 million at March 31, 2018, increased by $35.9 million, or 5.0 percent, since March 31, 2017. Growth from the prior year included $12.8 million in checking and $23.1 million in savings and time deposit balances.\n\"Along with the $11 million in SBA production, we had additional balance sheet loan growth in the quarter of $11 million. Our $30 million increase in capital reflected the very positive response we experienced from our capital raise in February. Additionally, we continued to improve asset quality in the quarter, with net charge offs at just 1 basis point and nonperforming assets at 38 basis points.\"\nLoan Portfolio ($000's)\nMar. 2018\nDec. 2017\nSep. 2017\nJun. 2017\nMar. 2017\nVariance\nYOY\nCommercial\n$ 107,579\n$ 102,041\n$ 104,723\n$ 107,319\n$ 102,392\n$ 5,187\n% of Total\n15.2%\n14.6%\n15.5%\n16.5%\n16.4%\n5.1%\nCommercial RE\n338,586\n332,154\n319,764\n296,116\n282,951\n55,635\n% of Total\n47.9%\n47.7%\n47.4%\n45.4%\n45.1%\n19.7%\nAgriculture\n50,266\n51,947\n51,140\n52,107\n47,580\n2,686\n% of Total\n7.1%\n7.5%\n7.8%\n8.0%\n7.6%\n5.6%\nResidential RE\n151,820\n150,854\n141,296\n137,214\n136,762\n15,058\n% of Total\n21.5%\n21.7%\n20.9%\n21.1%\n21.8%\n11.0%\nConsumer & Other\n58,956\n59,619\n58,152\n58,833\n57,037\n1,919\n% of Total\n8.3%\n8.6%\n8.6%\n9.0%\n9.1%\n3.4%\nTotal Loans\n$707,207\n$696,615\n$675,075\n$651,589\n$626,722\n$ 80,485\nTotal Growth Percentage\n12.8%\nDeposit Bal.
