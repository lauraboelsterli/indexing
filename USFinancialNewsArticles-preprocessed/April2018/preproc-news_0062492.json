Soccer Football - Scottish Premiership - Celtic v Rangers - Celtic Park, Glasgow, Britain - April 29, 2018 Celtic celebrate after winning the Scottish Premiership Action Images via Reuters/Jason Cairnduff\nRangers came into Sunday’s encounter having not tasted victory over their Glasgow rivals in eight matches, and were soon on the back foot after Odsonne Edouard had put the league leaders in front with just 14 minutes on the clock.\nEdouard made it two with a fine finish in the 42nd minute, before James Forrest drilled home a third on the stroke of halftime. Soccer Football - Scottish Premiership - Celtic v Rangers - Celtic Park, Glasgow, Britain - April 29, 2018 Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers celebrates after winning the Scottish Premiership Action Images via Reuters/Jason Cairnduff\nFurther goals from Tom Rogic and Callum McGregor in the 47th and 53rd minutes added to Rangers’ humiliation, as Celtic Park went into party mode. Slideshow (7 Images)\nCeltic should have won by a greater margin having missed a host of chances to add a sixth goal, but manager Brendan Rodgers will be delighted to have sealed a seventh crown in a row in such an emphatic manner.\nCeltic’s season is not over yet, as they still have the Scottish Cup final against Motherwell to come, as they chase an unprecedented second successive Scottish treble.\nRangers sit third, three points behind Aberdeen in second, with their managerial situation still shrouded in doubt, with former Liverpool and England midfielder Steven Gerrard linked with the job.\nThe 37-year-old Gerrard has been coaching with Liverpool’s development squad since retiring in 2016 and has said he wishes to become a manager.\nGerrard and Rangers chairman Dave King attended Liverpool’s Champions League semi-final first leg with AS Roma on Tuesday and the BBC has reported that Rangers are prepared to offer him the job even though he has no direct experience of Scottish football.
