    "text": "NAPLES, Fla., April 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FTE Networks, Inc. (NYSE American:FTNW) (\"FTE\" or the \"Company\"), a leading provider of innovative technology-oriented solutions for smart platforms, network infrastructure and intelligent buildings, announced today its financial results for the three-month period and year ended December 31, 2017.\nOperational Highlights\nAchieved a combined backlog of approximately $434 million as of December 31, 2017 Announced new infrastructure and technology expansion projects valued at approximately $133 million year-to-date, as of April 11, 2018 Successfully uplisted to the New York Stock Exchange (American) in December 2017\nFinancial Highlight for the Fourth Quarter of 2017\nTotal revenue of $110.5 million, up 40% sequentially, compared to $79.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017\nFinancial Highlights for the Full Year 2017\nTotal revenue of $243.4 million in 2017, reflecting contribution of Benchmark Builders from April 21, 2017 Gross Margin of 15% Adjusted EBITDA of $21.2 million* Adjusted EPS of $0.83*\n“During 2017, FTE laid the foundation for dynamic growth, by expanding its product and service portfolio and positioning itself as a provider of a complementary suite of technology and general contracting solutions that spans multiple high-growth market segments,” commented Michael Palleschi, FTE’s Chief Executive Officer. “We are highly confident in our ability to maximize the synergies between our Benchmark Builders, CrossLayer and Jus-Com units to drive robust top-and-bottom line growth, and sustainable shareholder value.”\nMr. Palleschi continued, “We have already begun to see the benefits of this operating model, as evidenced by our record fourth quarter revenue, a nearly 40% sequential increase from our third quarter results. While we expect some near-term variability in expenses as we integrate CrossLayer as the foundation of our leading technology and infrastructure service suite to Fortune 100/500 companies and top-ranking REITs, we believe that the robust revenue growth and strong backlog of $434 million, and projected pipeline at year-end are a testament to the underlying strength of this model.”\n“As we near the one year anniversary of the acquisition of Benchmark Builders on April 20 th , I am proud of the tremendous progress we have made over the past year. We have successfully integrated a $300 million revenue generating business into a GAAP compliant, public entity, launched an innovative technology platform into Benchmark’s installed sales channel, and uplisted to a prominent stock exchange, the NYSE American. These accomplishments fuel our optimism as to our ability to capitalize on the growth opportunity that lies before us,” Mr. Palleschi concluded.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $110.5 million. The consolidated gross margin was 13%, as compared with 15% for the full year 2017.\nOperating profit was approximately $(4.1) million in fourth quarter of 2017, which included approximately $7.0 million in one-time expenses, compared to the prior quarter gain of $4.8 million which included approximately $1.8 million in one-time expenses.\nNet income was approximately $(13.5) million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared to a gain of $2.5 million for the period ending September 30, 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA was approximately $7.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017.*\nAt the end of 2017, combined backlog totaled approximately $434 million.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the full year 2017 was $243.4 million, which includes the revenue contribution of Benchmark Builders from April 21, 2017, following the closing of its acquisition by FTE. On a pro-forma basis, full-year revenues including Benchmark from January 1, 2017 would have been $285.5 million. In 2016, total revenue was $12.3 million.\nConsolidated gross margin for 2017 was 15%, compared with 28% in 2016, as Benchmark Builders’ margin is lower than FTE’s Jus-Com network unit.\nCash provided by operations was $4.1 million for 2017.\nOperating expenses for the full-year 2017 were $38.6 million, compared with $5.8 million in 2016. The increase in expenses is attributable to several factors related to the acquisition of Benchmark Builders, including higher stock compensation expense, increased selling, general and administrative expense, transaction-related expenses and amortization expense of intangible assets.\nOperating loss for the full year 2017 was $1.6 million, compared to a loss of $2.4 million in 2016.\nOther expense for the full-year 2017 was $17.8 million, compared with $3.8 million in 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to the interest expense, amortization of deferred financing costs and higher financing costs, all related to the acquisition of Benchmark Builders.\nNet loss for 2017 totaled $20.1 million, or $4.23 per share, compared with a loss of $6.2 million, or $0.10 per share, in 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA was approximately $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $(1.9) million in 2016.*\nAs of December 31, 2017, FTE had $15.6 million in cash and working capital of $1.9 million.\nOutlook for Full Year 2018\nFor 2018, FTE is focused on driving revenue growth by leveraging its three complementary business units to realize operating efficiencies, and enhance margins and profitability, as part of its long-term strategy. With the successful integration of Benchmark Builders, the launch of the compute-to-the-edge technology powered by CrossLayer combined with the legacy business Jus-Com, the Company is positioned to achieve its mission of being a “one-stop-shop” technology and infrastructure company.\nIn 2018, CrossLayer is focused on expanding the number of buildings on-net and increasing the monthly recurring revenue base. FTE has made additional investments in CrossLayer to increase its sales force and establish partnerships with globally recognized firms to support and expand its pipeline throughout the United States, and to ensure its sustained momentum.\nThe Company is introducing its outlook for the full year 2018 as follows:\nNet revenue of $350 million Adjusted EBITDA of $30 million Operating Income of $15 million Buildings on-net, 30\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nAs previously announced, the Company is hosting a conference call with the investment community this morning at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time, featuring remarks by Michael Palleschi, Chief Executive Officer, and David Lethem, Chief Financial Officer.\nThe dial-in information for the conference call is as follows:\nDate: Wednesday, April 18, 2018 Time: 11:00am EST U.S. Toll-Free dial-in number: (877) 407-9716 International dial-in number: 1-201-493-6779 The conference call will also be available via live audio webcast, which can be accessed through the events section of the Investor Relations section of the Company’s website at https://ir.ftenet.com/news-events or at http://public.viavid.com/index.php?id=129179 .

Management believes that presentation of operating results using non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to investors and facilitates the analysis of the Company's core operating results and comparison of core operating results across reporting periods. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making, planning and forecasting purposes and to manage the Company's business. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enable investors to evaluate our operating results and future prospects in the same manner as management. The non-GAAP financial measures do not replace the presentation of GAAP financial results and should only be used as a supplement to and not as a substitute for the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. There are limitations inherent in non-GAAP financial measures because they exclude charges and credits that are required to be included in a GAAP presentation, and do not therefore present the full measure of the Company's recorded costs against its net revenue. In addition, the Company's definition of the non-GAAP financial measures below may differ from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.\nDefinitions of Non-GAAP Measures:\nNon-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA\n\"Adjusted EBITDA\" is defined by FTE Networks as net income from continuing operations before: (i) interest expense, (ii) tax expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense, (iv) non-cash, stock-based compensation expense, and if applicable in a reporting period (v) acquisition related transaction expenses (vi) non-cash impairments of intangible assets (vii) debt financing costs (viii) and other significant non-recurring or non-operating (income) or expenses.\nNon-GAAP Adjusted Diluted EPS\n\"Adjusted Diluted EPS\" is defined by FTE Networks as Adjusted Net Income divided by Adjusted Diluted Shares outstanding. Adjusted Diluted Shares outstanding is the sum of Diluted shares outstanding and the weighted average number of common shares that would be outstanding if the preferred stock were converted into common stock on the original issue date based on the number of days such common shares would have been outstanding in the reporting period. In addition, if GAAP Net Income is negative and Adjusted Net Income is positive, Adjusted Diluted Shares will also include any warrants that would be outstanding as dilutive instruments using the treasury stock method.\nBasis for Non-GAAP Adjustments\nFTE Networks’ basis for excluding certain expenses (income) from GAAP financial measures, are outlined below:\nAmortization of intangible assets — The intangible assets that give rise to this amortization expense relate to acquisitions, and the amounts allocated to such intangible assets and the terms of amortization vary by acquisition and type of asset. FTE Networks excludes these items to provide a consistent basis for comparing operating results across reporting periods, pre and post-acquisition.\nStock-based compensation expenses — As incentive for both employees and certain non-employees, from time to time shares of the Company’s common stock are issued by the Board of Directors. Without adjusting for these non-cash expenses, the Company believes it would be difficult to compare financial results from core operations across reporting periods on a consistent basis.\nDeemed dividends on preferred stock — GAAP accounting for the structure of the Series A and Series A-1 Preferred Stock requires the Company to accrue a set dividend rate quarterly. Since such dividends are not paid in cash, the Company believes these non-cash expenses are not meaningful in evaluating the operating performance of the Company and it would be misleading to not adjust for such expenses across reporting periods.\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA (Unaudited, in thousands) For the Three Months ended For the Twelve Months ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net Income (Loss) (GAAP) $ (13,534,880) $ (3,064,252) $ (20,108,774) $ (6,313,995) Adjustments to Net Income (Loss): Interest expense 1,467,997 819,919 5,819,388 2,272,273 Income tax expense (benefit) 534,677 - 785,038 - Amortization 7,563,812 397,221 15,840,083 725,165 Depreciation 517,401 236,737 616,478 516,066 Financing costs 5,754,350 10,119,251 Acquisition related costs 775,000 226,004 2,699,234 226,004 EBITDA 3,078,358 (1,384,371) 15,770,698 (2,574,487) Further Adjustments to EBITDA: Non-cash stock based expense 4,388,395 189,673 5,466,296 618,267 Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) $ 7,466,753 $ (1,194,698) $ 21,236,994 $ (1,956,220)\nReconciliation of GAAP Net Income Available to Common Stockholders to Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income and GAAP Earnings\nper Share to Non-GAAP Adjusted Earnings per Share (Unaudited, in thousands) For the Three Months ended For the Twelve Months ended December 31, December 31, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (GAAP) $ (13,554,771) $ (3,084,143) $ (20,188,338) $ (6,393,556) Adjustments to Net Income (Loss): Amortization 7,563,812 397,221 15,840,083 725,165 Deemed dividends on preferred stock 19,891 19,891 79,564 79,561 Non-cash stock based expenses 4,388,395 189,673 5,466,296 618,267 Acquisition related costs 775,000 226,004 2,699,234 226,004 Adjusted net income (non-GAAP) $ (807,673) $ (2,251,354) $ 3,896,839 $ (4,744,559) Net income (loss) per common share (GAAP) Diluted EPS $ (2.44) $ (1.28) $ (4.30) $ (2.64) Adjustments to diluted loss per share: Amortization of intangibles 1.36 0.16 3.37 0.30 Non-cash stock based compensation expenses 0.79 0.08 1.16 0.26 Acquisition related costs 0.14 - 0.57 Deemed dividends on preferred stock 0.00 0.01 0.02 0.03 Impact of including warrants in Adj.
