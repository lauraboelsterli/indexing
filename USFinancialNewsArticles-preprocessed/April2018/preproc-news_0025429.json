    "text": "MATTOON, Ill., April 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Mid-Illinois Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ:FMBH) (“First Mid”) announced that, on April 13, 2018, its Board of Directors declared a special pro-rated dividend in the amount of $0.29 per share payable on April 30, 2018 to shareholders of record as of April 23, 2018. The $0.29 per share amount represents a pro-ration of First Mid’s current semi-annual dividend. This special dividend is being paid in preparation for the expected closing of the acquisition via merger of First BancTrust Corp. (“First Bank”) (OTCQX:FIRT) by First Mid, and in accordance with the related agreement and plan of merger. The closing date for the merger is expected to be May 1, 2018, and the special pro-rated dividend is being declared and paid in order to align First Mid and First Bank’s respective dividend policies ahead of closing. The agreement and plan of merger requires that First Mid and First Bank coordinate the declaration of their respective dividends so that the holders of First Bank common stock do not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in connection with the merger.\nIn accordance with First Mid’s current dividend policy, and subject to the discretion of, and declaration by, First Mid’s Board of Directors, it is anticipated that the next dividend shareholders of First Mid will receive (including First Bank shareholders as shareholders of First Mid, assuming the closing of the merger) will be a pro-rated portion of First Mid’s semi-annual dividend that will be payable in early June 2018 (for the period between the record date of the special dividend announced today and the record date for the semi-annual dividend payable in early June 2018).\nAbout First Mid-Illinois Bancshares, Inc.: First Mid-Illinois Bancshares, Inc. is the parent company of First Mid-Illinois Bank & Trust, N.A., Mid-Illinois Data Services, Inc., and First Mid Insurance Group.
