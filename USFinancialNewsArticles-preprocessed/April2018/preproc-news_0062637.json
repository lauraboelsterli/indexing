Loss per diluted share in the quarter was $(0.29), up from $(0.60) in the prior-year period. First quarter 2018 results include the impact of acquisition expenses 1 related to Granite’s announced and pending acquisition of Layne Christensen Company (LAYN: NASDAQ) and from our recently completed purchase of LiquiForce. Excluding the impact of these expenses, first quarter loss was $5.0 million, or $(0.13) per diluted share.\n\"We were pleased to deliver solid results with a record-revenue first quarter, carrying through some of the momentum we created in 2017,\" said James H. Roberts, President and Chief Executive Officer of Granite Construction Incorporated. \"All three segments delivered strong revenue growth and improved year-over-year margins. Our Construction segment led the way, with the Construction Materials segment producing strong top-line revenue growth in our seasonally weakest quarter. The Large Project Construction segment again produced solid revenue growth and improved profitability, driven primarily by the contribution of newer projects in our portfolio. While work on under-performing, mature projects had less impact in the first quarter, it remained a drag on overall profitability, and it is expected to negatively impact margins through much of 2018.\n\"The near- and long-term outlook for demand and funding of infrastructure investment continues to improve. Backlog trends remain steady, even with more than 20 percent revenue growth in the first quarter. Large Project Construction segment backlog at $2.61 billion and Construction segment backlog at nearly $1 billion points to continued solid demand,\" Roberts said. \"The integration of LiquiForce is moving along as planned, and the integration planning related to our announced acquisition of Layne Christensen is progressing very well. Considering the progress that our joint integration teams have made to date, we are increasingly confident that this deal represents the ideal combination of value creation for all stakeholders. We remain on track for a successful closing in the second quarter of 2018.\"\nFirst Quarter 2018 Results\nTotal Company\nConsolidated revenue increased 20.3 percent to $563.4 million, compared with $468.4 million in the first quarter of 2017. Consolidated gross profit increased 124.0 percent to $56.3 million, compared with $25.1 million last year. Consolidated gross profit margin was 10.0 percent, compared with 5.4 percent in 2017. Total Company backlog was $3.59 billion, up 4.4 percent year-over-year. Construction segment backlog decreased 16.8 percent year-over-year to $978.3 million. Large Project Construction segment backlog increased 15.4 percent from last year to $2.61 billion. Selling, general & administrative expenses decreased slightly to $61.3 million from $61.8 million last year. Our balance sheet remains strong with cash and marketable securities of $300.8 million as of March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter Segment Results\nConstruction\nConstruction revenue increased 18.7 percent to $269.2 million, compared with $226.8 million last year. Gross profit increased 40.5 percent to $38.4 million, compared to $27.3 million last year. Gross profit margin of 14.3 percent increased from 12.0 percent a year ago. Solid execution drove the strong revenue and profit increases in the first quarter, which also resulted in year-over-year backlog burn. Project lettings and our bookings ramped up in the quarter, reflecting improvement after soft demand across geographies in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result, segment backlog finished at $978.3 million, an increase of 9.1 percent sequentially.\nLarge Project Construction\nLarge Project Construction revenue increased 20.0 percent to $248.4 million, compared with $207.0 million last year. Gross profit increased to $20.4 million, compared to $2.6 million last year. Gross profit margin was 8.2 percent, compared with 1.2 percent in 2017. Revenue and profit improvement was driven primarily by the contribution of newer projects in our portfolio, as work on under-performing, mature projects had less impact. Mature, underperforming projects still represent a significant amount of expected segment revenue in 2018, with these projects expected to impact profitability negatively through much of the year as we work to complete these projects during the remainder of 2018. Segment backlog increased 15.4 percent year-over-year to $2.6 billion, while decreasing 7.6 percent sequentially. The market opportunities remain robust, as we continue to re-shape our project portfolio with improved project and partner selectivity, aligned to increased returns that balance project risk dynamics.\nConstruction Materials\nConstruction Materials revenue increased 32.5 percent to $45.7 million, compared with $34.5 million last year. Gross loss of $2.5 million improved 47.9 percent from a loss of $4.8 million last year. While remaining negative in the quarter, gross profit margin improved more than 800 basis points from last year to (5.4) percent. The gross profit and margin improvement was attributable primarily to improved external demand across geographies in the West.\nOutlook and Guidance\n\"Our results and our outlook reflect our focus on execution of our strategic and operating plans, building and investing to capture the benefits of positive market trends. Demand continues to point to growth fueled by private market opportunities now combining with improving public funding trends across geographies and end markets. These early-stage dynamics point to broad opportunities for the next three years or more. Aligned to our emphasis on efficiency and disciplined cost control, our expectations for steady top-line growth and solid bottom-line improvement remain in place across our business for 2018 and beyond,\" said Roberts.\nThe Company’s expectations for 2018 are:\nLow-double digit consolidated revenue growth Consolidated EBITDA margin 2 of 7.0 percent to 8.0 percent\n(1) Please refer to the description and non-GAAP net income and earnings per diluted share reconciliation of the above-noted acquisition-related costs in the attached tables.

Topic 606 requires, among other things, to disclose unearned revenue. We generally include a project in our unearned revenue at the time a contract is awarded, the contract has been executed and to the extent we believe funding is probable.\n(2) Other awards include unissued task orders and unexercised contract options to the extent their issuance or exercise is probable as well as contract awards to the extent we believe contract execution and funding is probable.\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nThe tables below contain financial information calculated other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). Specifically, management believes that non-GAAP financial measures such as EBITDA and consolidated EBITDA margin are useful in evaluating operating performance and are regularly used by securities analysts, institutional investors and other interested parties, and that such supplemental measures facilitate comparisons between companies that have different capital and financing structures and/or tax rates. We are also providing additional non-GAAP financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted consolidated EBITDA margin and Adjusted net loss attributable to Granite Construction Incorporated, to reflect the impact of acquisition and integration expenses related to the acquisition of LiquiForce and to the pending acquisition of Layne Christensen Company. Management believes that these additional non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons between companies without acquisition transactions by securities analysts, institutional investors and other interested parties. However, the reader is cautioned that any non-GAAP financial measures provided by the Company are provided in addition to, and not as alternatives for, the Company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Items that may have a significant impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows must be considered when assessing the Company's actual financial condition and performance regardless of whether these items are included in non-GAAP financial measures. The methods used by the Company to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures provided by the Company may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.\nGRANITE CONSTRUCTION INCORPORATED EBITDA (1) (Unaudited - dollars in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net loss attributable to Granite Construction Incorporated $ (11,423 ) $ (23,790 ) Depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (2) 15,511 14,649 Benefit from income taxes (4,131 ) (12,496 ) Interest expense, net of interest income 914 1,692 EBITDA $ 871 $ (19,945 ) Consolidated EBITDA Margin (3) 0.2 % (4.3 %) Acquisition and integration expenses (4) $ 8,409 $ — Adjusted EBITDA $ 9,280 $ (19,945 ) Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin 1.6 % (4.3 %) (1) We define EBITDA as GAAP net loss attributable to Granite Construction Incorporated, adjusted for interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization.\n(2) Amount includes the sum of depreciation, depletion and amortization which are classified as cost of revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations of Granite Construction Incorporated.\n(3) Represents EBITDA divided by consolidated revenue.
