Germany’s 10-year bond yield, the benchmark for the bloc, dropped to a one-week low of 0.483 percent on the news.\nFurther pressure on euro zone borrowing costs came after data showed U.S. consumer prices in March fell for the first time in 10 months, reinforcing expectations the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at a gradual pace.\nU.S. Treasury yields slipped to 2.77 percent, down 2 basis points on the day. Euro zone bond yields were down 1-3 basis points by the end of trading, having first reversed Tuesday’s rise, as the European Central Bank distanced itself from a governing council member’s comments about moving away from deeply negative deposit rates.\nECB policymaker Ewald Nowotny told Reuters on Tuesday there was a possibility of a 20 basis-point hike in the deposit rate as part of ECB efforts to normalise policy. But a spokesperson said this did not represent the bank’s view.\n“(It) ...is a very clear statement that the ECB is in favour of sequencing,” said DZ Bank strategist Daniel Lenz, referring to the expected plan that the key rate will remain at its current level until well after the bank ends its bond purchase programme.\nMarkets now expect the ECB to stop buying bonds by the end of the year, then raise interest rates for the first time since 2011 sometime in the second quarter of next year, even as inflation remains short of its target.\nOn Wednesday, ECB policymaker Ardo Hansson said euro zone inflation will eventually pick up as the economy grows, but the ECB needs to remain patient and remove stimulus only very gradually.\nEuro zone government bonds have been in demand ever since growth in the continent’s economy stopped beating forecasts this year. Trade tensions between the United States and China have also kept the German 10-year bund around 0.50 percent.\nAny full-blown trade war would be likely to upset the plans of major central banks to tighten policy - fuelling demand for government bonds.\nECB chief Mario Draghi said on Wednesday that the direct effect on the euro zone economy of trade tariffs announced by the United States and China is small but they can hurt investor confidence and trigger retaliation.
