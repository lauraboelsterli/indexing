REUTERS/Philippe Wojazer/File Photo \nThe Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada said the probes, which broaden two existing investigations, will look at whether the companies broke federal and provincial personal privacy rules. FILE PHOTO: A woman walks past an empty office suite, which had until recently been used by Canadian data firm AggregateIQ, in a building in Victoria, B.C., Canada March 27, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Light \nCanada’s privacy commissioner launched an investigation of Facebook in March after the New York Times and London’s Observer newspaper broke news of the use of Facebook data by political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. \nFacebook Canada said on Wednesday that more than 600,000 Canadians had their data “improperly shared” with Cambridge Analytica. \nBritish Columbia’s privacy commissioner was separately investigating AggregateIQ over whether the Victoria-based company had broken provincial personal privacy rules for its role in the Brexit campaign. \nThe two agencies will now jointly investigate the companies, as they are subject to both federal and provincial personal privacy laws.
