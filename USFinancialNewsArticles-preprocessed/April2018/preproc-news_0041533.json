The stock is up 16 percent so far this year, sharply outperforming a 3 percent rise in the Thomson Reuters Europe Steel Index .\nSSAB said the steel tariffs introduced in the quarter had so far had a limited impact on its business.\nThe company also said contract prices and longer lead times meant a sharp rise in North American heavy plate spot prices since November only began to boost SSAB’s margins toward the end of the quarter.\nSSAB forecast good underlying demand for high-strength steels in most markets during the second quarter.\n$1 = 8.4168 Swedish crowns Reporting by Johannes Hellstrom Editing by Niklas Pollard and Edmund Blair\n ",
