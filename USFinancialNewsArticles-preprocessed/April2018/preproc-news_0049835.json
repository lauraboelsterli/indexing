    "text": "1 COMMENTS SL Green Realty Corp. , New York’s largest office building owner, has signed its third largest lease at its development rising next to Grand Central Terminal, in a sign of strength for a traditional part of midtown that has been viewed as vulnerable to the city’s trendy new office districts.\nThe Chicago-based law firm McDermott Will & Emery has agreed to move its New York office to 106,000 square feet in One Vanderbilt, which is expected to rise to 1,401 feet tall and be completed in 2020, according to SL Green. Law firm Greenberg Traurig this year also signed a deal for more than 130,000 square feet in the building, which is now 31% leased.\nSL Green has said its goal is to be 37% leased by the end of 2018.\n“The year is off to a good start,” said Steven Durels, the real-estate investment trust’s leasing director.\nEncompassing an entire block, One Vanderbilt is one of the most closely watched office projects in the city because of its size, location and high rents. SL Green was asking more than $160 a square foot per year for the floors that McDermott Will is taking, according to market observers. Average Midtown rents in March were about $80 a square foot, according to real estate services firm JLL.\nSL Green’s management believe they can fill the building designed by Kohn Pederson Fox Associates because of its prime location and modern layouts. Features include an auditorium, conference spaces, a 30,000 square foot tenant-only amenity floor with an outdoor terrace and a restaurant by chef Daniel Boulud.\nOne Vanderbilt’s largest lease, 200,000 square feet, was signed in 2014 with TD Bank, the U.S. unit of Toronto Dominion Bank .\n“Everyone is striving to get the best employees and to differentiate themselves as employers,” Mr. Durels said. “The work environment is often a big part of that recruitment discussion.”\nTraditional office neighborhoods in midtown have been threatened in recent years as new neighborhoods gained popularity with the city’s younger workers and the companies that wanted to attract them. Hudson Yards, which was a windswept rail yard on Manhattan’s far west side a decade ago, has lured numerous big-name tenants in recent years including BlackRock Inc., Time Warner Inc. and KKR & Co.\nLately, though, the area around Grand Central has won a string of battles in the tug of war. Most impressive, JPMorgan Chase & Co. earlier this year announced plans to build a 2.5 million square-foot headquarters at 270 Park Ave.\nRents and occupancies have been rising in New York’s recovering office market in recent years, but at a slower rate than in past cycles. This is partly because employers have been getting more efficient on how they use space.\nFor example, McDermott Will, which is now located at 340 Madison Ave., has a head count of roughly 300 and has expanded about 25% over the past year, according to John Yoshimura, the firm’s chief operating officer. But the amount of new space it is leasing—in One Vanderbilt and a separate back office location—is roughly the same amount of space it is giving up, people who worked on the One Vanderbilt deal said.\nThe firm can do this by using new space designs and other efficiencies.\n“No tenant that’s come into One Vanderbilt is solely looking at the rent per square foot,” Mr. Durels said. “What they’re looking at is the cost per employee. They get more for their dollar here.”\nWrite to Peter Grant at peter.grant@wsj.com",
