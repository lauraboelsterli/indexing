    "text": "NEW YORK and CAESAREA, Israel, April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- DarioHealth Corp. (NASDAQ: DRIO), a leading global digital health company with mobile health and big data solutions, announced today it has hired U.S.-based digital health executive JC Muyl as Head of Commercialization North America to head up the Company's business-to-business sales of the Dario Engage platform. This follows the recent appointment of Joao Mendes-Roter as DarioHealth's V.P. of Marketing to lead the Company's robust worldwide direct-to-consumer user engagement and sales.\nDario Engage, the Company's business-to-business platform, provides healthcare and wellness companies the ability to digitalize chronic condition management from a clinical and data driven outcome stand point. The platform is agile and may be easily customized to integrate and implement any clinical programs covering all facets of diabetes management and care including Type 1, Type 2, gestational diabetes, and prediabetes.\nJC Muyl, based in DarioHealth's New York City office, will focus on boosting Dario Engage sales and onboarding of healthcare providers, insurers, clinics and employers that seek a digital platform to deliver user-centric, efficient diabetes monitoring, engagement and management for their patients and employees. Mr. Muyl is a U.S.-based digital health executive with a successful track record in launching and growing multiple healthcare service lines into global multi-million dollar businesses. He was instrumental in growing C3i Solutions, a healthcare customer engagement company, from a 30-person startup to a 1,400-employee global player.\nJoao Mendes-Roter, V.P. of Marketing, will focus on expanding DarioHealth's highly successful direct-to-consumer marketing and customer acquisition activities in all territories where the Company's blood glucose monitoring system has received regulatory registrations. DarioHealth currently has access to 48.5 million people with diabetes in the seven countries in which its product is available, representing over 10% of the global market. Ms. Mendes-Roter is a marketing executive and online digital expert in growth marketing and direct response. She has a proven track record in increasing revenues and customer experience via better funnels, new products, effective online-offline marketing channels, and new business opportunities. Prior to joining DarioHealth, she held senior roles at 888 Holdings where she led business-to-consumer marketing and customer acquisition campaigns.\n\"We are very pleased to have Mr. Muyl and Ms. Mendes-Roter, two very high performing executives join the DarioHealth team to ramp up our commercialization capabilities,\" said Erez Raphael, Chairman and CEO of DarioHealth. \"We believe that the potential to grow our sales through the business-to-business channel is potentially substantial and near term. By partnering with payers and healthcare providers, we believe we can exponentially increase the number of end-users served. Mr. Muyl has the right experience and knowledge to lead the business segment in the U.S.\n\"On the direct-to-consumer side of our business, today we have tens of thousands of active users worldwide and the momentum continues to build. Ms. Mendes-Roter has deep experience in building successful user engagement and customer acquisition. We've seen that competing products have not been able to gain traction in the direct-to-consumer segment as we believe DarioHealth has, and we believe by leveraging the strength of our user-centric approach, we are positioning DarioHealth as the leader in this direct-to-consumer segment. We also truly believe that our business-to-business partners will be able to leverage on our user-centric approach and will be able to develop their own relationships with the end users by utilizing our Dario Engage platform.\"\nAbout DarioHealth Corp.\nDarioHealth Corp. (NASDAQ: DRIO ) is a leading global digital health company serving its users with dynamic mobile health solutions. In today's day and age, knowledge of health and treatment is being democratized, and we believe people deserve to know everything about their own health and have the best tools to manage their condition. DarioHealth employs a revolutionary approach whereby harnessing big data, we have developed a novel method for chronic disease data management, empowering people to analyze and personalize self-diabetes management in a totally new way without having the disease slow them down.
