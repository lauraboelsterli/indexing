    "text": "April 26, 2018 / 6:17 AM / in a few seconds French oil major Total's first-quarter profits lifted by record production Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\nPARIS (Reuters) - Record output and high oil prices helped French oil and gas major Total ( TOTF.PA ) report a consensus-beating rise in net adjusted profit during the first three months of the year, with Total adding it would surpass its production target for 2018. FILE PHOTO: The logo of French oil giant Total is seen on the uniform of an employee at its first gas station in Mexico City, Mexico January 25, 2018. REUTERS/Daniel Becerril/File Photo\nTotal produced 2.703 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) in the first quarter, driven by ramp-ups and new acquisitions, up more than 5 percent compared to the same period in 2017, and above analysts’ estimates of 2.663 million boe/d.\nIt was the company’s highest output ever recorded in a quarter, surpassing a previous record of 2.66 million boe/d in 2003.\nNet adjusted profit came in at $2.9 billion, beating analysts’ forecast of $2.77 billion in the quarter.\n“Oil prices continued to rebound in the first quarter 2018,” said Total’s Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne in a statement.\n“Brent rose to an average of $67 per barrel, supported by strong demand, OPEC-non-OPEC compliance and geopolitical tensions,” he also said.\n“Cash flow after organic investments increased to $2.8 billion, up by more than 50 percent from a year ago, thanks to good operational performance and continued spending discipline,” added Pouyanne.
