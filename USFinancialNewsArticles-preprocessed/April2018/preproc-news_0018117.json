    "text": "April 12, 2018 / 9:44 AM / Updated 29 minutes ago Nigeria's Oando up 10 pct after bourse lifts trading suspension   \nLAGOS,   Shares of Nigerian oil company Oando surged 10 percent on resuming trade in Lagos on Thursday after the regulator lifted a suspension. \nOando shares jumped to 6.60 naira immediately after the stock market opened on Thursday. They had closed at 6.30 naira on Wednesday. \nThe shares traded only briefly on Wednesday after being suspended for six months following directives from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which is investigating the oil company over alleged insider trading. \nThe regulator briefly reimposed the suspension on Wednesday, citing SEC directives but then lifted it again by Thursday. \nWhen the shares were originally suspended six months ago they were trading at 5.99 naira.
