    "text": "ROSEVILLE, Calif., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ClearCaptions, a leading provider of innovative telephone captioning services and staunch advocate for individuals who are hard-of-hearing, announced today that Corrine Perritano has been named as company Chief Operating Officer. Drawing on more than 25 years of experience in the consumer health and wellness space, Perritano will manage the company’s day-to-day operations and will report directly to CEO Robert Rae.\nPerritano brings a wealth of business knowledge and experience in leading multi-location, client-focused organizations. She most recently served as president of Beltone North America, a leader in hearing aid products. In 2017, under Perritano’s leadership, Beltone grew more than three times the market average rate, this thanks to her focus on increasing brand awareness and delivering commercial excellence.\nPreviously, Perritano served as CEO of Total Woman Gym and Spa. Prior to that, she spent 22 years with leading weight management company Jenny Craig, Inc. where she served in several key leadership positions including Chief Information Officer and Global Vice President of Direct to Consumer Business. Ultimately, she ascended to the role of Executive Vice President of Sales and Operations where she was responsible for the growth and profitability of the company’s call centers and 700 corporate locations, worldwide.\n“We are thrilled to have Corrine join our team,” says CEO Robert Rae. “With her impressive track record managing sales and operations teams for more than 25 years and her proven history of driving business growth and winning market share, she brings valuable perspective to ClearCaptions. I am confident that she can help lead our team on the path of sustained growth and I look forward to our collaboration in meeting and exceeding our company goals.”\n“I’m very excited to be joining the ClearCaptions team,” says Perritano. “They’re one of the most talented organizations I have had the privilege to observe. Their level of commitment to changing the lives of the customers they serve is beyond admirable. Plus, everyone at ClearCaptions demonstrates how dedicated they are to further innovate the call captioning service. I’m glad to join them in this effort of making a positive difference in people’s lives.”\nHow ClearCaptions works\nClearCaptions enables the near real-time transcription of a spoken phone conversation into text captions. Through use of the service, a caller’s words are converted into text for easy reading and reference. The service is free, made possible by federal funding in conjunction with Title IV of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), available for a variety of technology platforms including personal computers, mobile devices and specially-designed captioning telephones.\nClearCaptions provides the Ensemble ™ captioning phone, a breakthrough innovation in telephone technology that simplifies everyday communication for individuals who have any form of hearing loss. Besides captioning of the words a caller is saying, the phone also includes an audio-boosted handset that increases incoming call volume up to 50db. The integrated answering machine with captioned messaging, built-in call log, and hands-free speakerphone are but a few of the additional features of this remarkable phone.\n“For the millions of people who have hearing loss, captioning enables them to enjoy everyday phone conversations that many of us take for granted,” said Gordon Ellis, ClearCaptions’ Vice President of Sales. “Making and receiving phone calls should be a comfortable experience for everyone. There’s no need to be guessing at what is being said or asking to have a caller repeat themselves; that’s what has made many people uneasy about using the phone. With the ClearCaptions service, we’re able to help folks enjoy using the phone again.”\nAbout ClearCaptions – WordsMatter™\nClearCaptions is a Federal Communications Commission (FCC)-certified telephone captioning provider that was fully established in 2011. ClearCaptions provides an innovative suite of captioning services through a variety of platforms, including personal computers, mobile devices and home phones.
