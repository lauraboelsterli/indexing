    "text": "AUSTIN, Texas, April 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Vermillion, Inc. (Nasdaq:VRML), a bio-analytical solutions company focused on gynecologic disease, today announced the pricing of the previously announced concurrent but separate underwritten public offerings of 10,000,000 shares of its common stock at a price to the public of $1.00 per share and 50,000 shares of its Series B Convertible Preferred Stock at a price to the public of $100.00 per share. Each share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock is non-voting and convertible into 100 shares of Vermillion, Inc. common stock, based on an initial conversion price of $1.00 per share, automatically upon receipt of stockholder approval of the conversion. As part of the common stock offering, Vermillion, Inc. has granted the underwriter a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 1,500,000 shares of common stock at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions, to cover over-allotments, if any. The offerings are being conducted as separate public offerings by means of separate prospectus supplements, and neither offering is contingent upon the consummation of the other. All of the shares are being offered by Vermillion, Inc. The offering is expected to close on April 17, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions.\nPiper Jaffray & Co. is the sole underwriter for the offerings.\nAggregate gross proceeds from the offerings are expected to be $15 million, or $16.5 million if the underwriter exercises its over-allotment option in full, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by Vermillion, Inc. Vermillion, Inc. intends to use the net proceeds from the offerings for working capital and general corporate purposes, including sales and marketing, portfolio expansion and general administrative expenses.\nEach offering is being made pursuant to a shelf registration statement (File No. 333-221092) previously filed with, and declared effective by, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).

The preliminary prospectus supplements and accompanying prospectuses for these offerings were filed with the SEC on April 12, 2018.
