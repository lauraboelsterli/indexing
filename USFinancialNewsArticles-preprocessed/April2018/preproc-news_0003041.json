The Company uses these financial measures to understand and evaluate its business. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of the operating performance of the core business operations. Studio-Level EBITDA is a supplemental measure of the operating performance of the studios. Adjusted free cash flow is a supplemental measure of the operating performance of the core business operations excluding deferred revenue. Studio-Level free cash flow is a supplemental measure of the operating performance of the studios excluding deferred revenue. Adjusted net loss is a supplemental measure of operating performance that is adjusted for certain non-recurring items that we do not believe directly reflect the core business operations. Accordingly, the Company believes Adjusted EBITDA, Studio-Level EBITDA, Adjusted free cash flow, Studio-Level free cash flow and Adjusted net loss provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the Company’s operating results in the same manner as management and the Board. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Studio-Level EBITDA, Adjusted free cash flow and Studio-Level free cash flow\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA and Studio-Level EBITDA to Net loss.
