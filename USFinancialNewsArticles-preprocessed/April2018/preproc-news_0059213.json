    "text": "TORONTO, April 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Lundin Mining Corporation (TSX:LUN) (Nasdaq Stockholm:LUMI) (“Lundin Mining” or the “Company”) today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a dividend of CAD$0.03 per share, payable on June 19, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 1, 2018. This dividend qualifies as an 'eligible dividend' for Canadian income tax purposes. The declaration, timing, amount and payment of future dividends remain at the discretion of the Board of Directors.\nDividends on shares traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (“TSX”) will be paid in Canadian Dollars (“CAD”) on June 19, 2018.\nDividends on shares traded on Nasdaq Stockholm will be paid in Swedish kronor (“SEK”) in accordance with Euroclear principles on June 20, 2018. To execute the payment of the dividend, a temporary administrative cross-border transfer closure will be applied by Euroclear from and including May 31, 2018 up to and including June 1, 2018, during which period shares of the Company cannot be transferred between TSX and Nasdaq Stockholm .\nNotice to all Non-Canadian Resident Shareholders\nIn 2012, the Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) changed how the tax withholding rate applied to dividend payments made to non-residents is determined. The CRA now requires a certification of residency from each shareholder so that the preferred tax treaty rate can be applied where applicable to person’s resident in countries which have a tax treaty with Canada.\nShares traded on Toronto Stock Exchange\nForm NR301 will be mailed to any new Registered non-resident shareholders as at the dividend record date (June 1, 2018), by Computershare Investor Services Inc. In order to receive the preferred treaty rate, you must complete and mail back the form as soon as possible. Failure to supply a completed NR301 form will result in Computershare withholding the statutory 25% withholding tax rate on any payments to Registered non-resident shareholders. You can also download the form at https://cda.computershare.com/Content/4f677775-5e6c-4e64-a695-a5785771fec3 . Instructions on how to correctly complete the NR301 are on the back of the form. Shareholders who hold their shares through a broker should contact their broker directly. They do not need to return a form to Computershare. If you have already completed Form NR301, you do not need to complete a new form.\nShares traded on Nasdaq Stockholm\nDividend payments will be made net of 25% Canadian withholding tax and any other deemed applicable country of residence tax. Holders who are entitled to reclaim taxes applicable under tax treaties should contact the applicable tax authorities, directly. Shareholders who hold their shares through a nominee should contact their nominee.\nAbout Lundin Mining\nLundin Mining is a diversified Canadian base metals mining company with operations in Chile, the United States of America, Portugal, and Sweden, primarily producing copper, nickel and zinc.
