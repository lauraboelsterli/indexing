    "text": "(Updates with details of Didi's service)\nSAN FRANCISCO, April 23 (Reuters) - Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing on Monday began offering its service in the Mexican city of Toluca, near Mexico City, the company said, setting up a potentially costly battle with rival Uber Technologies Inc in a key Latin American market.\nThe Mexican launch marks the first time Didi has brought its own app-based ride service outside of Asia, a critical global expansion that comes as the company faces increased competition at home from internet giant Meituan-Dianping, which recently launched its own ride-hailing service.\nIn Mexico, Didi will go up against Uber, its chief international rival, for the first time since Uber's launch in China that ended with a merger of the two companies' operations in 2016. Uber is the ride-hailing leader in Mexico, where it has seven million users in more than three dozen cities.\nReuters was first to report Didi's plan in Toluca, the capital city of the state of Mexico, earlier this month.\nDidi, which has an operations hub in the Juarez neighborhood in Mexico City, said it hopes to bring its ride-hailing service to other major Mexican cities later this year.\nDidi said teams in Mexico, Beijing and California studied the Mexican market to adapt Didi's algorithms and other ride-service technologies for the local market, addressing issues such as crime.\nDidi is bringing to Mexico a number of new safety features, including an emergency alert system that will connect drivers and passengers with police and other emergency contacts if they find themselves in danger, a safety monitoring system and a way for passengers to share their ride itinerary.\nThe company started recruiting drivers in early April, promising not to take any piece of their fares until June 17. After mid-June, Didi plans will take a 20 percent cut, below the 25 percent commission by Uber, Reuters previously reported.\n(Reporting by Heather Somerville in San Francisco.
