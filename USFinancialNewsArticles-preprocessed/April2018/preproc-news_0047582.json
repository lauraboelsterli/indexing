(NYSE: BXP) , a real estate investment trust and one of the largest owners, managers and developers of Class A office properties in the United States, reported results today for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nNet income attributable to common shareholders was $176.0 million compared to $97.1 million 2017.

Net income attributable to common shareholders 2018 includes a gain on sale of real estate of approximately $96.4 million, or $0.56 per share basic and $0.56 per share on a diluted basis.

This compares to FFO of $228.4 million, or $1.48 per share basic and $1.48 per share diluted, 2017. FFO of $1.49 per share diluted was greater than the mid-point of the Company’s guidance previously provided of $1.47 - $1.49 per share diluted primarily due to: $0.02 per share due to better than expected portfolio operations, partially offset by $0.01 per share of greater than projected general and administrative expenses. The Company updated its guidance for full year 2018 EPS and FFO per share as follows: Projected EPS (diluted) for 2018 of $3.28 - $3.37 per share; and Projected FFO per share (diluted) for 2018 of $6.27 - $6.36 per share.

Except as described below, the estimates reflect management’s view of current and future market conditions, including assumptions with respect to rental rates, occupancy levels and the earnings impact of the events referenced in this release and otherwise referenced during the conference call referred to below. The estimates do not include possible future gains or losses or the impact on operating results from other possible future property acquisitions or dispositions, other possible capital markets activity or possible future impairment charges.

This is an increase of $0.02 per share at the mid-point of the Company’s guidance consisting of $0.03 per share of better than expected portfolio performance, $0.01 per share of additional development and management service revenue, offset by a ($0.02) per share increase in general and administrative expenses.\nIn addition, the Company has updated its projected guidance for FFO per share (diluted) for the full year to $6.27 - $6.36 per share from $6.23 - $6.36 per share.

diluted 154,705 154,214 FFO per share diluted $ 1.49 $ 1.48 (1) Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit”), we calculate Funds from Operations, or “FFO,” by adjusting net income (loss) attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, impairment losses on depreciable real estate consolidated on our balance sheet, impairment losses on our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and real estate-related depreciation and amortization. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure, but we believe the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, has improved the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and has helped make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO and FFO per share to be useful measures for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO and FFO per share can help investors compare the operating performance of a company’s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies.\nOur computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current Nareit definition or that interpret the current Nareit definition differently.\nIn order to facilitate a clear understanding of the Company's operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders as presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements. FFO should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to Boston Properties, Inc. common shareholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to the Company's financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nBOSTON PROPERTIES, INC.\nPORTFOLIO LEASING PERCENTAGES\n% Leased by Location March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Boston 94.8 % 94.1 % Los Angeles and San Francisco 89.0 % 89.3 % New York 86.3 % 86.9 % Washington, DC 90.6 % 91.3 % Total Portfolio 90.5 % 90.7 %\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180424006653/en/\nBoston Properties\nMichael LaBelle, 617-236-3352\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\nor\nArista Joyner, 617-236-3343\nInvestor Relations Manager\nSource: Boston Properties, Inc.",
