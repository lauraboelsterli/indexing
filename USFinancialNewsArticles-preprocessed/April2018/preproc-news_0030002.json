If implemented, these would be very likely to damage world growth, market players say.\nAs U.S. bond yields rose, the gap between two-year U.S. T-bonds and German Bunds pushed out to its widest since March 1989 at 296 bps.\nSpain’s 10-year bond yield spread over Bunds was at its narrowest in a week at about 71.9 bps after Friday’s Moody’s upgrade.\nMoody’s upgraded Spain’s ratings to Baa1 from Baa2 and said that improvements in the country’s credit profile outweighed a drag from political factors.\nElsewhere, Slovakia sold long-dated bonds, kicking off this week’s auctions in the bloc.\nReporting by Dhara Ranasinghe Editing by Louise Ireland and David Goodman\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles. 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
