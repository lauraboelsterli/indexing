    "text": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., April 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kaya Holdings, Inc. (OTCQB:KAYS), announced that it has disclosed fiscal year 2017 results of operations by filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 with the SEC.\nKAYS 2017 10-K Highlights includes the report of the following items:\nDollars, Sense and Room to Grow. Revenues held steady at just under $1million as we worked through the intricacies of Marijuana Licensing under the umbrella of a public company, while total assets better than doubled on a year-over-year basis increasing from approximately $700K to just under $1.5 million. The increase in assets is a result of an expanded institutional financing (a total of $3.15mm in 2017, $450K to date in 2018 and an additional commitment of $5.55 million to follow) over the next few years afforded us the ability to properly build out two additional Kaya Shack™ Marijuana Superstores and acquire a 26 acre plot of land to begin to develop our footprint for Kaya Farms and build on our brand.\nOLCC Licensing & Launch of New Kaya Shack™ Retail Marijuana Stores. During 2017, KAYS opened its third retail outlet (our second Kaya Shack™ Marijuana Superstore) in North Salem and readied our fourth retail outlet (our third Kaya Shack™ Marijuana Superstore, the largest yet at just under 3100 square feet) for our pending Grand Opening Celebration to feature a total of 4 retail marijuana stores, each operating with OLCC Recreational, Medical and Delivery Licenses.\n12-Month Growth Plan and Development of the Kaya Holdings Family of Brands. The Company expects to continue its growth with the grand opening celebration and proper marketing plan to launch the Kaya Shack™ chain of Marijuana Superstores. Also, the Company will soon launch home delivery service of signature products with our fleet of distinctly wrapped Kaya Cars™, as well as complete the licensing of Kaya Farms and launch a to-be-announced edible brand.\n“We see a clear path to growth and profitability and have been endeavoring to implement our business plan in a cautious manner, remaining compliant and assessing risks,” stated KAYS’ CEO Craig Frank. “While we would have liked to have seen greater growth, we realize that the temporary restrictions on our Portland store at the start of the year and the navigation of the OLCC Licensing process required us to make an investment of time and money for the future. We believe as we gain greater control over costs, increase our offering, introduce in-store innovations, expand services, demonstrate our community commitment, and engage in creative marketing we shall see only the beginnings of the potential of Kaya Holdings.”\nA copy of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, complete with pictures, store information and product testing as filed with the SEC, is available online at www.sec.gov .\nRegister for updates on our Grand Opening Launch of the four Kaya Shack™ Stores and Kaya Car™ Home Delivery Service as well as the pending zoning announcement for the 101K Square foot, 26 Acre Kaya Farms™ Medical and Recreational Marijuana Grow and Manufacturing Complex.\nAbout Kaya Holdings, Inc. ( www.kayaholdings.com )\nKAYS (OTCQB:KAYS), through subsidiaries, produces, distributes or sells legal premium medical and recreational cannabis products, including flower, concentrates and oils, and cannabis-infused foods.\nIn 2014, KAYS, became the first publicly traded company to own and operate a Medical Marijuana Dispensary.
