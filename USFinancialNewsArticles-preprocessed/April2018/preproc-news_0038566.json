    "text": "BOWLING GREEN, Ky., April 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Citizens First Corporation (NASDAQ: CZFC) today reported results for the three months ended March 31, 2018 which include the following:\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018 the Company reported net income of $1,084,000, or $0.43 per diluted common share (EPS). This represents a 19.5% increase or $177,000 from the $907,000, or $0.36 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. \"Loan growth and lower income tax expense combined to drive profitability in the first quarter,\" said Todd Kanipe, President and CEO. \"The challenge continues to be our margin as the competition for deposits in our region stiffens,\" Kanipe added.\nIncome Statement\nNet interest income increased $120,000, or 3.2%, from the prior year. The Company's net interest margin was 3.55% for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 3.68% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of 13 basis points. The Company's net interest margin was impacted by an increase in the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities of 27 basis points.\nThere was a $30,000 provision for loan losses in both the current and previous year.\nNon-interest income increased $8,000, or 1.0%, primarily due to an increase in service charges on deposit accounts of $20,000 and an increase in other service charges and fees of $17,000, offset by a reduction in gains on the sale of securities of $23,000 and a decrease in gains on the sales of mortgage loans of $18,000.\nNon-interest expense increased $68,000, or 2.1%, primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses of $112,000 offset by a reduction in data processing expenses of $59,000.\nIncome tax expense decreased $117,000, or 31.9% due to a marginal rate of 21% in 2018 compared to a rate of 34% in 2017.\nCredit Quality\nNon-performing assets totaled $2.1 million, or 0.43% of total assets, at March 31, 2018 compared to $1.3 million, or 0.29% of total assets at December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $740,000. The balance is primarily one restructured agricultural-related credit which was moved to non-accrual status during the first quarter of 2017.\nThe allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2018 was $4.7 million, or 1.21% of total loans, compared to $4.9 million, or 1.34% of total loans as of March 31, 2017. We consider the size, volume and credit quality of the loan portfolio as well as recent economic and other external influences to record the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses that is directionally consistent with our loan portfolio.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets at March 31, 2018 were $487.0 million, compared to $465.4 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $21.6 million or 4.6%. Loans increased $14.7 million, or 3.9%, from December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018. Deposits increased $14.2 million, or 3.8%, from December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018. Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank increased $7.0 million, or 17.5%, from December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018.\nStockholders' equity increased to $46.4 million at March 31, 2018 from $45.8 million at December 31, 2017. The book value per common share and tangible book value per common share ratios were $18.29 and $16.64, respectively, at March 31, 2018 compared to $18.14 and $16.47, respectively, at December 31, 2017.\nQuarterly Common Dividend Payable May 16\nOn April 19, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per common share payable May 16, 2018 to shareholders of record on May 4, 2018. This represents an increase of 16.7% from the quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per common share declared in January, 2018.\nAbout Citizens First Corporation\nCitizens First Corporation is a bank holding company headquartered in Bowling Green, Kentucky and established in 1999.
