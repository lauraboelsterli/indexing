U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) speaks following the weekly policy luncheons at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S. March 13, 2018. REUTERS/Eric Thayer \n“I haven’t seen clear indication yet that we needed to pass something to keep him from being removed, because I don’t think that’s going to happen,” McConnell told reporters. “And that remains my view, that I don’t think he’s going to be removed from this office.” Reporting by Makini Brice and Lisa Lambert; Writing by Tim Ahmann; Editing by Mohammad Zargham",
