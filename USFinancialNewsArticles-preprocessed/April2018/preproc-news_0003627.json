It was the first time in three weeks that the rig-count fell.\nBaker Hughes published its North American rig count report on Thursday, one day earlier than usual, due to the Good Friday holiday on March 30.\nOil prices have generally been supported by supply restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia, which started in 2017 in order to rein in oversupply and prop up prices.\nRising trade tensions between the U.S. and China are likely to weigh on sentiment and could make for volatile trading in the coming days, traders and analysts said.\nChina slapped extra tariffs of up to 25 percent on 128 U.S. products including frozen pork, as well as wine and certain fruits and nuts, in response to U.S. duties on imports of aluminum and steel, the country's finance ministry said on Sunday night.\n\"Investors took their cue from falling U.S drilling counts,\" Wang Xiao, head of crude oil research with Guotai Junan Futures said. \"But increasing trade friction between China and U.S. is likely to rock global markets and tarnish bullish sentiment in crude oil markets.\"\nTrading volumes on Monday are likely to be low as many countries, especially in Europe, will still be on Easter holiday.\n($1 6.2726 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein in SINGAPORE and Meng Meng in BEIJING Editing by Aaron Sheldrick)",
