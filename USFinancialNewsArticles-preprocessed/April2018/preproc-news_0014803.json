    "text": "April 8, 2018 / 6:55 PM / Updated an hour ago Motor racing-Ferrari mechanic injured in Bahrain GP pitstop Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nMANAMA, April 8 (Reuters) - A Ferrari mechanic was taken to hospital with a broken leg after being hit by Kimi Raikkonen’s car during a Bahrain Grand Prix pitstop on Sunday. \nRaikkonen, who had been in third place, was told to stop immediately and retired in the pitlane while team mate Sebastian Vettel went on to win. \nFerrari said the mechanic on the left rear wheel, named only as Francesco, had a suspected shin bone and fibula fracture after being knocked over as the Finn was wrongly given the signal to leave with only three tyres replaced. \n“I go when the light is green. I don’t see what happens behind and unfortunately he got hurt,” said Raikkonen, the 2007 world champion. “My job is to go when the light says so. Hopefully, he’s OK.” \nFerrari chairman Sergio Marchionne wished the mechanic a speedy recovery in his post-race statement. \n“I am sorry for Kimi who could certainly have finished on the podium,” he added.
