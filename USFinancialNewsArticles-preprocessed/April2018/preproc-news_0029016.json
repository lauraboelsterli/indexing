Book value per share of $16.02 as of March 31, 2018 increased 4.6% compared to book value per share of $15.31 as of March 31, 2017. Tangible book value per share of $13.39 as of March 31, 2018 increased 6.2% compared to tangible book value per share of $12.61 as of March 31, 2017. Non-performing assets of $20.3 million, or 0.70% of total assets as of March 31, 2018, compared to $20.4 million, or 0.74% of total assets, as of December 31, 2017 and $21.6 million, or 0.83% of total assets, as of March 31, 2017.\nJoseph B. Bower, Jr., President and CEO, stated, “We are pleased with the growth in the quarter of both deposits and loans. The increases have come from across all four brands. The growth in non-interest expenses in the quarter consist of several items that are isolated to the first quarter. We believe that the expense growth will slow throughout the rest of 2018.”\nNet Interest Margin\nNet interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis was 3.72% and 3.67% for the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The yield on earning assets increased 21 basis points to 4.53% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from 4.32% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 17 basis points to 0.93% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from 0.76% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nTotal interest and dividend income increased by 17.1% to $29.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from $25.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Net interest income increased by 13.7% to $24.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from $21.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nAsset Quality\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2018, CNB recorded a provision for loan losses of $1.6 million, as compared to a provision for loan losses of $1.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Net chargeoffs in the first quarter of 2018 were $569 thousand, compared to net chargeoffs of $800 thousand in the first quarter of 2017. CNB Bank net chargeoffs totaled $45 thousand and $111 thousand during the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, or 0.01% and 0.02%, respectively, of average CNB Bank loans. Holiday Financial Services Corporation is CNB’s consumer discount company and recorded net chargeoffs totaling $524 thousand and $689 thousand during the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, one commercial real estate loan that was impaired at year end 2017 experienced further deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower, resulting in an additional provision for loan losses of $1.8 million. In spite of the strong organic loan growth in the first quarter of 2018, CNB was able to decrease its general loan loss reserve due to CNB’s continued low historical loan loss experience and its forecast of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of March 31, 2018.\nNon-Interest Income\nNet realized gains on available-for-sale securities were $0 during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $1.4 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Net realized and unrealized gains on trading securities were $14 thousand during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $188 thousand during the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Excluding the effects of securities transactions, non-interest income was $4.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $4.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nAs a result of CNB’s continued focus on growing its Private Client Solutions division, wealth and asset management revenues were $1.0 million during the quarter ended March 31, 2018, an increase of 18.3% from $871 thousand during the quarter ended March 31, 2017. In addition, as a result of its organic deposit growth, CNB experienced an increase in service charges in deposit accounts of $157 thousand, or 14.4%, in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-Interest Expenses\nTotal non-interest expenses were $19.0 million and $17.0 million during the quarters ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Salaries and benefits expense increased $530 thousand, or 5.9%, during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, CNB had 526 full-time equivalent staff, compared to 487 full-time equivalent staff as of March 31, 2017, an increase of 8.0%. The remainder of the increase in non-interest expenses is primarily a result CNB’s continued growth and the servicing of a larger customer base, along with expenses totaling $698 thousand resulting from stock-based compensation, the change in value of deferred compensation accounts, and a sales tax assessment.\nIncome Tax Expense\nAs a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the fourth quarter of 2017, income tax expense decreased $1.3 million, or 54.0%, during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2017. CNB’s effective tax rate was 13.7% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 27.4% in the first quarter of 2017.\nAbout CNB Financial Corporation\nCNB Financial Corporation is a financial holding company with consolidated assets of approximately $2.9 billion that conducts business primarily through CNB Bank, CNB Financial Corporation’s principal subsidiary.

Tangible common equity, tangible assets and tangible book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures calculated using GAAP amounts. Tangible common equity is calculated by excluding the balance of goodwill and other intangible assets from the calculation of stockholders’ equity. Tangible assets is calculated by excluding the balance of goodwill and other intangible assets from the calculation of total assets. Return on average tangible equity is calculated by dividing annualized net income by average tangible assets. Tangible book value per share is calculated by dividing tangible common equity by the number of shares outstanding. CNB believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide information to investors that is useful in understanding its financial condition. Because not all companies use the same calculation of tangible common equity and tangible assets, this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures calculated by other companies. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures is provided below (dollars in thousands, except per share data).\n** - Nonperforming TDR loans are also included in the balance of non-accrual loans in the previous table.
