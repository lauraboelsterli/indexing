    "text": "PHILADELPHIA, April 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- GlobalFit, a leading health and wellness technology solutions company based in Philadelphia, PA announced today that it has acquired a majority stake in WalkMyMind Inc., an innovative mindfulness startup company founded and led by CEO Diana Liberto. Following a successful pilot, GlobalFit and WalkMyMind have partnered to bring this new technology to employers.\nWalkMyMind is a mobile application that delivers a holistic approach to wellness by connecting the physical, mental, and emotional health of its users. The platform fosters walking, learning, listening, and community through \"walkcasts,\" audio podcasts that the user hears while in motion. WalkMyMind combines the physical health benefits of walking or running with the mental stimulation of audio podcasts curated from great thinkers, inspiring educators, and best-selling authors. Walkcast topics appeal to a range of interests, covering themes such as self-motivation, arts and culture, finance and daily news briefs. In addition to audio walkcasts, the app implements fitness features such as step counting, distance tracking, and wearable device integration to log and analyze the user's progress.\n\"In addition to recognizing the benefits of increased physical activity on their employees' overall health, our GlobalFit clients are noticing a distinct parallel between mindfulness and job performance,\" said GlobalFit President and CEO, Tony Frick. \"It is a natural progression for GlobalFit to expand into the mindfulness space, and we have found the ideal partner in WalkMyMind. Diana is revolutionizing the wellbeing of the corporate world, and employers are adopting her solution because they are seeing tangible results with WalkMyMind.\"\nThrough the WalkMyMind platform, employers can deliver company messaging and trainings to their employee base through a customizable \"brand box\" that is unique to their organization. WalkMyMind is a multi-tasking solution that broadens an employer's ability to engage employees at work while driving happiness, health, and engagement to ultimately generate higher levels of workplace productivity.\n\"Both GlobalFit and WalkMyMind recognize how overall wellness can positively impact the workforce, but approach the matter with different, yet compatible solutions. The goal is to motivate companies to make healthy changes that benefit both the employer and employees over the long-term,\" said WalkMyMind CEO, Diana Liberto. \"We share a vision of a healthier and happier workplace leveraging technology in order to create an improved corporate culture that values wellness.\"\nFor additional information about GlobalFit, the company's newest partnership with WalkMyMind, or to schedule an interview with a GlobalFit representative, please contact Jessica Olenik at Neff Associates directly via phone at (267)457-2045 or email at jo@neffassociates.com .\nABOUT GLOBALFIT:\nGlobalFit's health and wellness technology solutions accelerate wellness program engagement, leading to improved population health.
