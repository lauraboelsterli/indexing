    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany expects U.S. tariffs on steel imports to take effect from May 1, when a temporary exemption expires, a senior German official said on Thursday before Chancellor Angela Merkel flies to Washington for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump.\nA German flag flutters next to the ships at the loading terminal in the port of Hamburg, Germany March 15, 2018. REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer “May 1 is very close now. From today’s point of view, they will probably come,” the official said, adding that Germany still aimed to achieve a long-term delay for the introduction of tariffs.\nReporting by Paul Carrel and Madeline Chambers; Editing by Joseph Nasr\n ",
