    "text": "(Repeats to reach additional subscribers)\nLONDON, April 10 (Reuters) - The euro jumped on Tuesday, bond yields edged higher and European stocks gave up some gains after a top European Central Bank policymaker said the bank could raise its sub-zero desposit rate before normalising monetary policy.\nEwald Nowotny told Reuters in an interview that its 2.55 trillion euro ($3.1 trillion) bond buying programme would be wound down by the end of this year, which would then pave the way for the bank’s first rate rise since a fumbled move in 2011.\n“The market is moving on Nowotny’s comments that suggest there could be a 20 basis point move on the deposit rate rather than a 10 basis point step up,” ING strategist Martin Van Vliet said.\n“But though I don’t want to downplay the importance of his statements, if Draghi or Praet were to say this the move would be even bigger.”\nEuro zone borrowing costs rose by 1-3 basis points across the board. The yield on Germany’s 10-year Bund, the benchmark for the bloc, rose to a 5-day high of 0.525 percent\nEuro zone stocks slightly reduced gains but remained within their daily trading range, last up 0.5 percent.\nThe euro briefly jumped to the day’s highs of $1.2378 and was up 0.4 percent on the day.
