    "text": "Mad Money with Jim Cramer Cramer's lightning round: Wait for Take Two's earnings before buying It's that time again! \"Mad Money\" host Jim Cramer rang the lightning round bell, which means he gave his take on callers' favorite stocks at rapid speed. Updated 17 Hours Ago CNBC.com\nSpirit Aerosystems Holdings : \"No, no, I don't want you to lock in your loss. Right now the market is kind of anti the defense stocks and anti-aero, but how long can that last? This is a great company. I suggest that you just hold tight.\"\nBristol-Myers Squibb : \"Bristol-Myers has sold off so much, so much, and yet when I'm finished with it, it sells at 16 times earnings and it only yields 3 percent. So I would tell you I don't have a catalyst to make the thing come back other than a takeover, and I don't see one coming. Maybe it surprises you.\"\nTake Two Interactive : \"Right now that whole video game group is in, let's just say, turmoil because of some other, cheaper games that are in. I want to see Take Two's earnings before I say pull the trigger, but you do have a high-quality situation.\"\nDunkin' Brands Group : \"I'm a holder of Dunkin' and then if it goes through $60 I would be a buyer of Dunkin'. Not that far from here.\"\nThe Wendy's Company : \"We just had the company on. I thought they told a real good story. I'm going to say buy.\"\nUnivar Inc .: \"The chemical stocks are getting crushed here and I'm going to let them come in before I feel like [saying] you've got to buy them right here. I can't feel that way.\" Watch the full lightning round here:\nQuestions for Cramer?",
