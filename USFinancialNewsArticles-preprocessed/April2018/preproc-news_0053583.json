In addition, earnings were impacted by $4.3 million of acquisition-related expense and an elevated provision for loan losses of $5.9 million.\" Mr. Robbins continued, \"However, during the period, we crossed a significant milestone by completing the Pacific Continental core systems conversion and achieved a majority of the related cost saving initiatives. With the systems conversion behind us, we are well positioned to continue our focus on high quality earnings growth.\"\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets at March 31, 2018 were $12.53 billion, a decrease of $186.3 million from December 31, 2017. Loans were $8.34 billion, down $19.0 million from December 31, 2017 as loan originations of $264.3 million were offset by payments. Debt securities available for sale were $2.62 billion at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $113.7 million, or 4% from $2.74 billion at December 31, 2017. Total deposits at March 31, 2018 were $10.40 billion, a decrease of $136.6 million from December 31, 2017. Core deposits comprised 95% of total deposits and were $9.90 billion at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $142.4 million from December 31, 2017. The average cost of total deposits for the quarter was 0.10%, an increase of 2 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017.\nIncome Statement\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $115.5 million, an increase of $9.3 million from the linked quarter and an increase of $28.8 million from the prior year period. The increase from both the linked quarter and prior year period was primarily due to income from earning assets acquired in the Pacific Continental transaction, which closed on November 1, 2017. For additional information regarding net interest income, see the \"Net Interest Margin\" section and the \"Average Balances and Rates\" table.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income was $23.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of $438 thousand from the fourth quarter of 2018. The linked quarter decrease was principally due to lower card revenue partially offset by higher deposit account and treasury management fees. The lower card revenue reflects our change to net presentation of interchange revenue pursuant to the adoption of new revenue recognition accounting guidance on January 1, 2018. Specifically, $1.3 million of payment card network expenses that would have historically been presented in other noninterest expense are now presented in card revenue. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, noninterest income decreased by $1.7 million principally due to a prior year BOLI benefit of $1.5 million recognized in other noninterest income.\nNoninterest Expense\nTotal noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $86.0 million, an increase of $360 thousand from the fourth quarter of 2017. After removing the effect of acquisition-related expenses, noninterest expense for the current quarter increased $9.7 million from the linked quarter on the same basis. This increase was due to higher compensation and benefits as well as higher other noninterest expense. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, noninterest expense increased $17.0 million. This increase was driven by $2.9 million higher acquisition-related expenses in the current quarter as well as additional, ongoing expenses resulting from our November 1, 2017 acquisition of Pacific Continental.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate for the current quarter was 14.6%, compared to 61.5% and 26.6% for the linked and prior year periods, respectively. The decrease from both periods was principally attributable to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017. Specifically, the linked period's effective tax rate included a $12.2 million re-measurement charge so that our deferred tax assets at year-end 2017 reflected the new 21% corporate tax rate. The prior year period's effective tax rate reflected the then-enacted 35% corporate tax rate reduced by favorable tax attributes of certain earning assets and discrete tax benefits from share-based compensation.\nOur effective tax rate remains below the statutory tax rate due to tax-exempt income from municipal securities, bank owned life insurance and certain loan receivables. In addition, the current period's rate reflects the tax benefit of discrete items such as share-based compensation. For 2018, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.\nNet Interest Margin\nColumbia's net interest margin (tax equivalent) for the first quarter of 2018 was 4.22%, an increase of 2 basis points from the linked quarter and prior year period. The increases were due to higher loan accretion income during the current quarter. Columbia's operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) (1) was 4.18% for the first quarter of 2018, a decline of 7 basis points from the linked quarter and an increase of 9 basis points from the prior year period. The decrease from the linked quarter was primarily due to a lower tax rate utilized for the tax equivalent components of our net interest income, which lowered the margin by 7 basis points. The increase from the prior year period was due to higher loan yields and volumes which more than offset the lower tax rates used in the current quarter.\nThe following table shows the impact to interest income resulting from income accretion on acquired loan portfolios as well as the net interest margin and operating net interest margin:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nSeptember 30,\nJune 30,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n2017\n2017\n2017\n(dollars in thousands)\nIncremental accretion income due to:\nFDIC purchased credit impaired loans\n$\n329\n$\n265\n$\n972\n$\n753\n$\n2,117\nOther acquired loans\n3,370\n2,482\n1,903\n2,356\n1,948\nIncremental accretion income\n$\n3,699\n$\n2,747\n$\n2,875\n$\n3,109\n$\n4,065\nNet interest margin (tax equivalent)\n4.22\n%\n4.20\n%\n4.20\n%\n4.12\n%\n4.20\n%\nOperating net interest margin (tax equivalent) (1)\n4.18\n%\n4.25\n%\n4.15\n%\n4.09\n%\n4.09\n%\n(1) Operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the section titled \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" in this earnings release for the reconciliation of operating net interest margin (tax equivalent) to net interest margin.\nAsset Quality\nAt March 31, 2018, nonperforming assets to total assets were 0.72% compared to 0.63% at December 31, 2017. Total nonperforming assets increased $10.5 million from the linked quarter due to a $12.3 million increase in nonaccrual loans, partially offset by a decrease in other real estate owned.\nAndy McDonald, Columbia's Executive Vice President and Chief Credit Officer, commented, \"The agricultural portfolio continues to impact our credit metrics and again was one of the drivers behind the increase in our provision and nonperforming loans for the first quarter. However, the weakness within this portfolio is centered in cattle and potatoes which collectively account for about $127 million of loan balances at quarter end. The rest of our agricultural portfolio is performing consistent with our expectations with only 4% adversely classified.\"\nThe following table sets forth information regarding nonaccrual loans and total nonperforming assets:\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\n(in thousands)\nNonaccrual loans:\nCommercial business\n$\n57,619\n$\n45,460\nReal estate:\nOne-to-four family residential\n1,054\n785\nCommercial and multifamily residential\n14,539\n13,941\nTotal real estate\n15,593\n14,726\nReal estate construction:\nOne-to-four family residential\n1,210\n1,854\nTotal real estate construction\n1,210\n1,854\nConsumer\n4,042\n4,149\nTotal nonaccrual loans\n78,464\n66,189\nOther real estate owned and other personal property owned\n11,507\n13,298\nTotal nonperforming assets\n$\n89,971\n$\n79,487\nThe following table provides an analysis of the Company's allowance for loan and lease losses:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\n(in thousands)\nBeginning balance\n$\n75,646\n$\n71,616\n$\n70,043\nCharge-offs:\nCommercial business\n(2,477)\n(1,524)\n(1,127)\nOne-to-four family residential real estate\n—\n—\n(307)\nCommercial and multifamily residential real estate\n(223)\n(287)\n—\nOne-to-four family residential real estate construction\n—\n—\n(14)\nConsumer\n(264)\n(318)\n(428)\nPurchased credit impaired\n(1,343)\n(1,440)\n(1,939)\nTotal charge-offs\n(4,307)\n(3,569)\n(3,815)\nRecoveries:\nCommercial business\n802\n839\n365\nOne-to-four family residential real estate\n172\n188\n117\nCommercial and multifamily residential real estate\n159\n412\n78\nOne-to-four family residential real estate construction\n19\n71\n29\nCommercial and multifamily residential real estate construction\n—\n1\n—\nConsumer\n260\n311\n285\nPurchased credit impaired\n1,224\n2,450\n1,144\nTotal recoveries\n2,636\n4,272\n2,018\nNet recoveries (charge-offs)\n(1,671)\n703\n(1,797)\nProvision for loan and lease losses\n5,852\n3,327\n2,775\nEnding balance\n$\n79,827\n$\n75,646\n$\n71,021\nThe allowance for loan losses to period end loans was 0.96% at March 31, 2018 compared to 0.91% at December 31, 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, Columbia recorded a net provision for loan and lease losses of $5.9 million compared to a net provision of $3.3 million for the linked quarter and a net provision of $2.8 million for the comparable quarter last year. The net provision for loan and lease losses recorded during the current quarter consisted of $7.0 million of provision for loan losses for loans, excluding PCI loans and a provision recapture of $1.1 million for PCI loans.\nCash Dividend Announcement\nColumbia will pay a regular cash dividend of $0.26 per common share on May 23, 2018 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on May 9, 2018. Clint Stein, Columbia's Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, commented, \"With the passage of tax reform at the end of 2017, we made a commitment to allocate the benefits of a reduced tax burden amongst our employees, communities and shareholders so that all of our stakeholders benefit directly. Our 18% increase in the dividend this quarter reflects a market level payout of the additional capital generated by the reduced tax burden.\"\nConference Call Information\nColumbia's management will discuss the first quarter 2018 financial results on a conference call scheduled for Thursday, April 26, 2018 at 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time (4:00 p.m. ET).

Despite the usefulness of the operating net interest margin and operating efficiency ratio to the Company, there are no standardized definitions for them and, as a result, the Company's calculations may not be comparable with other organizations. The Company encourages readers to consider its consolidated financial statements in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nThe following tables reconcile the Company's calculation of the operating net interest margin and operating efficiency ratio:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n2017\nOperating net interest margin non-GAAP reconciliation:\n(dollars in thousands)\nNet interest income (tax equivalent) (1)\n$\n117,359\n$\n109,627\n$\n89,518\nAdjustments to arrive at operating net interest income (tax equivalent):\nIncremental accretion income on FDIC purchased credit impaired loans\n(329)\n(265)\n(2,117)\nIncremental accretion income on other acquired loans\n(3,370)\n(2,482)\n(1,948)\nPremium amortization on acquired securities\n2,075\n1,978\n1,462\nCorrection of immaterial error - securities premium amortization\n—\n1,771\n—\nInterest reversals on nonaccrual loans\n417\n443\n265\nOperating net interest income (tax equivalent) (1)\n$\n116,152\n$\n111,072\n$\n87,180\nAverage interest earning assets\n$\n11,122,753\n$\n10,453,097\n$\n8,520,291\nNet interest margin (tax equivalent) (1)\n4.22\n%\n4.20\n%\n4.20\n%\nOperating net interest margin (tax equivalent) (1)\n4.18\n%\n4.25\n%\n4.09\n%\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\n2017\nOperating efficiency ratio non-GAAP reconciliation:\n(dollars in thousands)\nNoninterest expense (numerator A)\n$\n85,987\n$\n85,627\n$\n68,986\nAdjustments to arrive at operating noninterest expense:\nAcquisition-related expenses\n(4,265)\n(13,638)\n(1,364)\nNet benefit (cost) of operation of OREO and OPPO\n4\n(46)\n(150)\nFDIC clawback liability recovery\n—\n—\n54\nLoss on asset disposals\n—\n(56)\n(6)\nState of Washington Business and Occupation (\"B&O\") taxes\n(1,317)\n(1,167)\n(1,123)\nOperating noninterest expense (numerator B)\n$\n80,409\n$\n70,720\n$\n66,397\nNet interest income (tax equivalent) (1)\n$\n117,359\n$\n109,627\n$\n89,518\nNoninterest income\n23,143\n23,581\n24,859\nBank owned life insurance tax equivalent adjustment\n379\n741\n689\nTotal revenue (tax equivalent) (denominator A)\n$\n140,881\n$\n133,949\n$\n115,066\nOperating net interest income (tax equivalent) (1)\n$\n116,152\n$\n111,072\n$\n87,180\nAdjustments to arrive at operating noninterest income (tax equivalent):\nInvestment securities gains (loss), net\n(22)\n11\n—\nGain on asset disposals\n(35)\n(34)\n(29)\nMortgage loan repurchase liability adjustment\n—\n—\n(573)\nChange in FDIC loss-sharing asset\n—\n—\n274\nOperating noninterest income (tax equivalent)\n23,465\n24,299\n25,220\nTotal operating revenue (tax equivalent) (denominator B)\n$\n139,617\n$\n135,371\n$\n112,400\nEfficiency ratio (tax equivalent) (numerator A/denominator A)\n61.04\n%\n63.93\n%\n59.95\n%\nOperating efficiency ratio (tax equivalent) (numerator B/denominator B)\n57.59\n%\n52.24\n%\n59.07\n%",
