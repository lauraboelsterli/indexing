    "text": "Company Doubles Down on Commitment to Giving Small Businesses Access to Capital Through Partnerships with Banks and Communities\nPORTLAND, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Mirador , provider of the leading intelligent small business lending platform, today announced the addition of Carol Glover, a veteran executive of leading financial technology companies such as Intuit, PayCycle and Bill.com , as the company’s first chief revenue officer. In this role, Glover will leverage her extensive business development expertise to expand Mirador’s partnerships with leading financial institutions and scale the company to meet accelerating market demand.\n“As we continue to reimagine the small business lending experience through our lens of an intelligent, secure, cloud-based technology solution, I’m thrilled to add Carol to our executive team,” said Trevor Dryer, co-founder and chief executive of Mirador. “I’ve known Carol since we were colleagues at Intuit and have always been impressed with her advocacy and passion for the small business owner, as well as her unique ability to create win-win partnerships that accelerate market growth.”\nSmall business owners across America are dependent on access to capital to fund growth. Most often, these small businesses turn to their community or branch banks for reasonably-priced loans. Community and local branch banks, however, are often not able to efficiently process and approve these loans, causing unnecessary delays and rejections, and negatively impacting the bank/customer relationship. “Our partnership with Mirador has created a lot of new value for our customers,” said Neena Miller, EVP and Chief Credit Officer at Tompkins VIST Bank. “The appointment of Carol underscores their focus on finding the right partners and arming them with the tools they will need to achieve success with borrowers. We look forward to a long and fruitful relationship moving forward.”\nMirador offers banks and financial institutions an elegant, cloud-based platform specifically developed for intelligent, secure and efficient processing of small business loans. This accelerates the flow of badly-needed cash to the small business and makes the loans financially viable for the bank and financial institution. “Partnerships, like this one with Mirador, help us to increase and improve our relationships with the credit unions we serve by empowering them to create better and more efficient lending processes for their members,” said Jim Gallagher, CEO of Lucro Commercial Solutions, Tallahassee, Florida. “We look forward to working closely with Carol and continuing our relationship with Mirador.”\nBanks of all sizes across the country are now using Mirador to delight their small business customers every day. “Financial institutions have modernized many facets of their business operations, but small business lending has been a hold out for too long,” noted Glover. “There should never be a reason that a small business needs to look outside of its bank to obtain capital from alternative lenders. Mirador is using small business lending innovation to positively impact communities around the country and their economies. As a technology partner, Mirador enables financial institutions to offer an elegant, intelligent and secure small business lending experience that enhances the borrower relationship, creates process efficiencies and provides actionable insights for lenders to better understand and predict borrower behavior.”\nPreviously, Glover was on the executive teams at both PayCycle (acquired by Intuit in 2009) and Bill.com , where she led the strategy and execution in building out bank channel business. Glover will continue to leverage her extensive knowledge of payment systems and financial technology at Mirador.\nAbout Mirador Financial Inc.\nMirador is passionate about helping small businesses grow through access to reasonably-priced business loans.
