    "text": "BETHESDA, Md.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (NYSE: PEB) (the “Company”) today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. The Company’s results include the following:\nFirst Quarter 2018 2017 ($ in millions except per share and RevPAR data)\nNet income $24.5 $14.1 Same-Property RevPAR (1) $195.17 $195.53 Same-Property RevPAR growth rate (0.2%) Same-Property Total RevPAR (1) $288.50 $283.64 Same-Property Total RevPAR growth rate 1.7% Same-Property EBITDA (1) $55.6 $54.5 Same-Property EBITDA growth rate 2.0% Same-Property EBITDA Margin (1) 30.7% 30.7% Adjusted EBITDA (1) $59.3 $49.0 Adjusted EBITDA growth rate 20.9% Adjusted FFO (1) $46.2 $38.7 Adjusted FFO per diluted share (1) $0.67 $0.54 Adjusted FFO per diluted share growth rate 24.1% (1) See tables later in this press release for a description of same-property information and reconciliations from net income (loss) to non-GAAP financial measures, including Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\"), Adjusted EBITDA, Funds from Operations (\"FFO\"), FFO per share, Adjusted FFO and Adjusted FFO per share.\nFor the details as to which hotels are included in Same-Property Revenue Per Available Room (“RevPAR”), Same-Property Total Revenue Per Available Room (“Total RevPAR”), Average Daily Rate (“ADR”), Occupancy, Revenues, Expenses, EBITDA and EBITDA Margins appearing in the table above and elsewhere in this press release, refer to the Same-Property Inclusion Reference Table later in this press release.\n“We’re extremely pleased with our portfolio’s first quarter operating performance, which significantly exceeded our initial outlook, as our results were much stronger than expected,” said Jon E. Bortz, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Pebblebrook Hotel Trust. “We are encouraged by the improved business travel demand trends we’re seeing, including increased short-term group and transient bookings, better group attendance and increased overall group spend. Leisure demand also continued to be solid. The overall improvements in business travel were broad-based across our portfolio, which enabled us to handily beat our outlook for Same-Property RevPAR growth, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted FFO per diluted share. These favorable demand trends have continued into the second quarter, which is encouraging, and makes us more optimistic about overall industry performance for 2018, as well as for our portfolio.”\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nNet income : The Company’s net income was $24.5 million in the first quarter of 2018, increasing $10.4 million as compared to the same period of 2017. Same-Property RevPAR and Same-Property Total RevPAR : Same-Property RevPAR for the quarter fell slightly by 0.2 percent versus 2017 to $195.17. Excluding San Francisco, Same-Property RevPAR rose 0.3 percent versus the prior year. Same-Property ADR increased 0.7 percent from the prior year to $244.44. Same-Property Occupancy decreased 0.8 percent to 79.8 percent. Same-Property Total RevPAR grew 1.7 percent over the same period of 2017 to $288.50. Same-Property EBITDA : The Company’s hotels generated $55.6 million of Same-Property EBITDA for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, increasing 2.0 percent over the same period of 2017. Same-Property Revenues grew 1.9 percent, while Same-Property Expenses rose by 1.9 percent. Same-Property EBITDA Margin increased 2 basis points to 30.7 percent for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA : The Company’s Adjusted EBITDA rose to $59.3 million from $49.0 million in the prior year period, an increase of 20.9 percent. Adjusted EBITDA includes $3.4 million of business interruption income related to losses incurred in 2017 at LaPlaya Beach Resort & Club (“LaPlaya”) and $2.4 million of dividend income received from the Company’s investment in liquid marketable securities. Adjusted FFO : The Company’s Adjusted FFO increased 19.3 percent to $46.2 million from $38.7 million in the prior year period. Dividends : On March 15, 2018, the Company declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.38 per share on its common shares, a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.40625 per share on its 6.50% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest and a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.39844 per share on its 6.375% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Shares of Beneficial Interest.\n“During the quarter, our RevPAR growth leaders consisted of our recently redeveloped hotels, including Hotel Zoe Fisherman’s Wharf, Revere Hotel Boston Common and Hotel Palomar Los Angeles Beverly Hills, as these hotels are continuing to gain market share and ramp up following their prior year renovations,” noted Mr. Bortz. “We also had strong top-line growth at our South Florida hotels, given the cold winter experienced by the Northeast and Midwest. Same-Property RevPAR for our portfolio declined only 0.2 percent, a significant improvement from our initial outlook of (1.5) percent to (3.5) percent. In addition, our hotels were successful in driving non-room revenue up 6.2 percent in the quarter as we continue to make progress reconcepting our food and beverage outlets and other public areas in order to improve revenue growth and profitability. As a result, our Same-Property Total Revenues increased 1.9 percent, and by limiting expense growth to 1.9 percent, we were able to improve Same-Property EBITDA by 2.0 percent, which is encouraging given the cost pressures we are experiencing across all of our markets.”\nUpdate on Impact from Hurricane Irma on LaPlaya Beach Resort & Club\nThe Company completed the major repair and remediation work at LaPlaya in the first quarter of 2018, and all guestrooms have been reopened and in operation since the end of January. The Company expects to complete additional scheduled repair work later in 2018, including in the second and third quarters, which will negatively impact the resort’s performance and is included in the Company’s outlook. The Company anticipates this disruption will be largely covered under the Company’s current business interruption and property insurance programs, although no business interruption proceeds for 2018 are included in the Company’s outlook. The Company reached an agreement with its insurance carriers on a net $3.4 million business interruption claim, after the deductible, for losses sustained by LaPlaya in 2017. This claim was recorded in the first quarter and was previously included in the Company’s 2018 outlook provided in late February.\nCapital Reinvestments\nIn the first quarter, the Company completed $16.2 million of capital investments throughout its portfolio. In April, the Company completed a $5.0 million conversion of Revere Hotel Boston Common’s nightlife club into a newly completed restaurant and bar called Rebel’s Guild. During the remainder of 2018, the Company will continue its remaining renovation projects at a number of properties that will improve performance in future years, including:\nMondrian Los Angeles (estimated at $17.0 million), which will undergo a renovation of the guestrooms and lobby as well as a renovation of our legendary Skybar beginning in the fourth quarter of this year, with an expected completion date in the first quarter of 2019; Hotel Zelos San Francisco (estimated at $6.0 million), which is planning a guestroom renovation to complement the transformative lobby, guestroom corridor and restaurant renovation completed in 2014; and Hotel Zephyr Fisherman’s Wharf, Zephyr Walk (estimated at $5.5 million), which is undergoing a redevelopment and re-leasing of most of the approximately 46,000 square feet of street level retail space that began in the fourth quarter of 2017, with an expected completion date in the second quarter of 2018.\nCapital Markets and Balance Sheet\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had $1.0 billion in consolidated debt at an effective weighted-average interest rate of 3.3 percent. The Company had $675.0 million outstanding in the form of unsecured term loans and $203.0 million outstanding on its $450.0 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had $23.2 million of consolidated cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash.\nDuring the quarter, the Company strategically purchased approximately 4.8 percent of the outstanding common shares of LaSalle Hotel Properties (NYSE: LHO) (“LaSalle”). As of March 31, 2018, excluding the dividend income and associated debt related to the purchase of the LaSalle shares, the Company’s fixed charge coverage ratio was 3.9 times and total net debt to trailing 12-month corporate EBITDA was 3.6 times.\nProposed Combination with LaSalle Hotel Properties\nFollowing LaSalle’s rejection, on March 28, 2018 the Company disclosed an initial proposal offering a common share-for-common share merger with LaSalle, representing an implied merger price of $29.95 per LaSalle common share. On April 16, 2018, the Company disclosed an increased offer to LaSalle, which also added an optional cash component. On April 24, 2018, the Company again disclosed an increased and final offer, based on a fixed exchange ratio of 0.9085, or an implied merger price of $32.49, which included an optional cash component (up to 20.0 percent of the total offer price), at the option of the shareholders. This third and final proposal represented a premium of 33.2 percent above LaSalle’s unaffected closing price on March 27, 2018, a 16.5 percent premium above analyst consensus NAV on March 27, 2018 and a 28.3 percent premium above analyst consensus price target as of March 27, 2018.\nThe Company believes that a merger with LaSalle presents a compelling strategic opportunity for the shareholders of both the Company and LaSalle, and the Company’s Board of Trustees unanimously supports a combination with LaSalle.\n2018 Outlook\nThe Company has increased its outlook for 2018, incorporating the Company’s first quarter performance as well as the improved business travel trends and overall incrementally positive economic activity. The Company’s 2018 outlook, which assumes no additional acquisitions or dispositions, reflects the Company’s various planned capital investment projects and includes other significant assumptions, is as follows:\n2018 Outlook\nas of April 26, 2018\nVariance to Prior Outlook\nas of February 22, 2018\nLow High Low High ($ and shares/units in millions, except per share and RevPAR data) Net income\n$84.4 $92.9 $4.7 $3.2 Adjusted EBITDA $238.0 $246.5 $13.5 $12.0 Adjusted EBITDA growth rate 2.1% 5.8% 5.8% 5.2% Adjusted FFO $178.0 $186.5 $6.4 $4.9 Adjusted FFO per diluted share $2.56 $2.69 $0.10 $0.08 Adjusted FFO per diluted share growth rate (0.4%) 4.7% 3.9% 3.1% This 2018 outlook is based, in part, on the following estimates and assumptions:\nU.S. GDP growth rate 2.50% 2.75% - - U.S. Hotel Industry RevPAR growth rate 1.0% 3.0% - - Urban Markets RevPAR growth rate (1.0%) 1.0% - - Same-Property RevPAR $208 $211 $1 - Same-Property RevPAR growth rate 0.0% 1.5% 0.5% - Same-Property EBITDA $250.1 $258.6 $5.6 $4.1 Same-Property EBITDA growth rate (1.7%) 1.6% 2.2% 1.6% Same-Property EBITDA Margin 33.1% 33.6% 0.5% 0.5% Same-Property EBITDA Margin growth rate (75 bps) (25 bps) 50 bps 50 bps Corporate cash general and administrative expenses $19.0 $19.0 ($2.0) ($2.0) Corporate non-cash general and administrative expenses $6.9 $6.9 $0.2 $0.2 Total capital investments related to renovations, capital maintenance and return on investment projects $55.0 $65.0 - - Weighted-average fully diluted shares and units 69.4 69.4 (0.3) (0.3) The Company’s outlook for the second quarter of 2018 is as follows:\nSecond Quarter 2018 Outlook Low High ($ and shares/units in millions, except per share and RevPAR data) Net income $24.8 $26.8 Same-Property RevPAR $220 $225 Same-Property RevPAR growth rate 1.0% 3.0% Same-Property EBITDA $71.4 $73.4 Same-Property EBITDA growth rate (0.2%) 2.6% Same-Property EBITDA Margin 35.3% 35.8% Same-Property EBITDA Margin growth rate (50 bps) 0 bps Adjusted EBITDA $64.8 $66.8 Adjusted EBITDA growth rate (3.5%) (0.6%) Adjusted FFO $48.2 $50.2 Adjusted FFO per diluted share $0.69 $0.72 Adjusted FFO per diluted share growth rate (8.0%) (4.0%) Weighted-average fully diluted shares and units 69.4 69.4 The Company’s estimates and assumptions, including the Company’s outlook for 2018 and the second quarter 2018 for Same-Property RevPAR, Same-Property RevPAR growth rate, Same-Property EBITDA, Same-Property EBITDA growth rate, Same-Property EBITDA Margin and Same-Property EBITDA Margin growth rate include the hotels owned as of March 31, 2018, as if they had been owned by the Company for all of 2017 and 2018, except for LaPlaya, which is not included in the third or fourth quarters.

In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations determined in accordance with GAAP.\nFunds from Operations (“FFO”) - FFO represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of properties, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships. The Company considers FFO a useful measure of performance for an equity REIT because it facilitates an understanding of the Company's operating performance without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, which assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, the Company believes that FFO provides a meaningful indication of its performance. The Company also considers FFO an appropriate performance measure given its wide use by investors and analysts. The Company computes FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its March 1995 White Paper (as amended in November 1999 and April 2002), which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to that of other REITs. Further, FFO does not represent amounts available for management’s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the Company’s cash needs, including its ability to make distributions. The Company presents FFO per diluted share calculations that are based on the outstanding dilutive common shares plus the outstanding Operating Partnership units for the periods presented.\nThe Company also evaluates its performance by reviewing Adjusted FFO because it believes that adjusting FFO to exclude certain recurring and non-recurring items described below provides useful supplemental information regarding the Company's ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of Adjusted FFO, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income (loss), more completely describes the Company's operating performance. The Company adjusts FFO for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refers to this measure as Adjusted FFO:\n- Hotel acquisition and disposition costs: The Company excludes acquisition and disposition transaction costs expensed during the period because it believes that including these costs in FFO does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Company and its hotels.\n- Non-cash ground rent: The Company excludes the non-cash ground rent expense, which is primarily made up of the straight-line rent impact from a ground lease.\n- Management/franchise contract transition costs: The Company excludes one-time management and/or franchise contract transition costs expensed during the period because it believes that including these costs in FFO does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Company and its hotels.\n- Interest expense adjustment for acquired liabilities: The Company excludes interest expense adjustment for acquired liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions, because it believes that including these non-cash adjustments in FFO does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Company.\n- Capital lease adjustment: The Company excludes the effect of non-cash interest expense from capital leases because it believes that including these non-cash adjustments in FFO does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Company.\n- Non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles: The Company excludes The Non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles, which includes but is not limited to The amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases and above/below market real estate tax reduction agreements because it believes that including these Non-cash adjustments in FFO does not reflect The underlying financial performance of The Company.\n- Estimated hurricane related repairs and cleanup costs: The Company excludes Estimated hurricane related repairs and cleanup costs during The period because it believes that including these adjustments in FFO does not reflect The underlying financial performance of The Company and its hotels.\n- Gain on insurance settlement: The Company excludes The Gain on insurance settlement because The Company believes that including this adjustment in FFO does not reflect The underlying financial performance of The Company and its hotels.\n- Business interruption proceeds: The Company includes Business interruption proceeds because The Company believes that including these proceeds reflects The underlying financial performance of The Company and its hotels.\n- Other: The Company excludes The ineffective portion of The change in fair value of The hedging instruments during The period because it believes that including these Non-cash adjustments in FFO does not reflect The underlying financial performance of The Company and its hotels.\nThe Company’s presentation of FFO in accordance with The NAREIT White Paper, and as adjusted by The Company, should not be considered as an alternative to net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of The Company’s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of its liquidity.\nPebblebrook Hotel Trust Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ($ in thousands) (Unaudited) Three months ended\nMarch 31,\n2018 2017 Net income (loss) $ 24,516 $ 14,089 Adjustments: Interest expense 9,811 9,341 Income tax expense (benefit) (429 ) (2,835 ) Depreciation and amortization 24,902 26,296 EBITDA $ 58,800 $ 46,891 Hotel acquisition and disposition costs 378 75 Non-cash ground rent 603 734 Management/franchise contract transition costs 52 85 Non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles 141 242 Impairment loss - 1,049 Estimated hurricane related repairs and cleanup costs 795 - Gain on insurance settlement (4,898 ) - Business interruption proceeds 3,381 - Other - (64 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 59,252 $ 49,012 To supplement the Company’s consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), this press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") rules.\nThese measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations determined in accordance with GAAP.\nFunds from Operations (“FFO”) - FFO represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from sales of properties, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships. The Company considers FFO a useful measure of performance for an equity REIT because it facilitates an understanding of the Company's operating performance without giving effect to real estate depreciation and amortization, which assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, the Company believes that FFO provides a meaningful indication of its performance. The Company also considers FFO an appropriate performance measure given its wide use by investors and analysts. The Company computes FFO in accordance with standards established by the Board of Governors of NAREIT in its March 1995 White Paper (as amended in November 1999 and April 2002), which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to that of other REITs. Further, FFO does not represent amounts available for management’s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion, debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the Company’s cash needs, including its ability to make distributions.

The Company adjusts FFO for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refers to this measure as Adjusted FFO:\n- Non-cash ground rent: The Company excludes the non-cash ground rent expense, which is primarily made up of the straight-line rent impact from a ground lease.\n- Gain on insurance settlement: The Company excludes the gain on insurance settlement because the Company believes that including this adjustment in FFO does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Company and its hotels.\n- Business interruption proceeds: The Company includes business interruption proceeds because the Company believes that including these proceeds reflects the underlying financial performance of the Company and its hotels.\n- Other: The Company excludes other expenses, which include hotel acquisition and disposition costs, management/franchise contract transition costs, interest expense adjustment for acquired liabilities, capital lease adjustment, non-cash amortization of acquired intangibles and estimated hurricane related repairs and cleanup costs because the Company believes that including these non-cash adjustments in FFO does not reflect the underlying financial performance of the Company and its hotels.\nThe Company’s presentation of FFO in accordance with the NAREIT White Paper, and as adjusted by the Company, should not be considered as an alternative to net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of the Company’s financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of its liquidity.\nAny differences are a result of rounding.\nPebblebrook Hotel Trust Reconciliation of Outlook of Net Income (Loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA ($ in millions) (Unaudited) Three months ending\nJune 30, 2018\nYear ending\nDecember 31, 2018\nLow High Low High Net income (loss) $ 25 $ 27 $ 84 $ 93 Adjustments: Interest expense and income tax expense 13 13 45 45 Depreciation and amortization 26 26 105 105 EBITDA $ 64 $ 66 $ 234 $ 243 Non-cash ground rent 1 1 2 2 Gain on insurance settlement - - (5 ) (5 ) Business interruption proceeds - - 3 3 Other - - 4 3 Adjusted EBITDA $ 65 $ 67 $ 238 $ 246 To supplement the Company’s consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), this press release includes certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") rules.\nThese measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.
