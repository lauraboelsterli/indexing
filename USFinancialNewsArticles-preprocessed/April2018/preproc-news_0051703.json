    "text": "The Cheesecake Factory restaurants post positive comparable sales as anticipated\nCALABASAS HILLS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated (NASDAQ: CAKE) today reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018, which ended on April 3, 2018.\nTotal revenues were $590.7 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to $563.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Net income and diluted net income per share were $26.0 million and $0.56, respectively, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\nComparable restaurant sales at The Cheesecake Factory restaurants increased 2.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.\n“Comparable sales at The Cheesecake Factory were very strong during the first quarter and meaningfully outperformed the casual dining industry,” said David Overton, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “However, increased labor costs to support the better guest traffic levels, as well as higher than expected insurance costs, impacted our bottom line results this quarter.”\nOverton continued, “Consistent with our long-term approach, we are making investments to maintain our high level of food quality, service and hospitality, which we believe will continue to differentiate us in the industry. In fact, The Cheesecake Factory was again named brand of the year in the casual dining category of the Harris Poll EquiTrend ® study, underscoring the continued relevance of the brand and our strong guest affinity. We were pleased to see these attributes reflected in our sales trend during the first quarter and believe we can continue to take share in 2018, which will better position us to manage through the cost pressures.”\nDevelopment\nThe Company continues to expect to open as many as four to six restaurants in fiscal 2018, including one Grand Lux Cafe, as well as the first location of a fast casual concept the Company is developing internally. The first restaurant opening is expected in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\nIn addition, the Company now expects as many as four restaurants to open internationally under licensing agreements in fiscal 2018. This includes the first location in Beijing, which opened in January, and the second location in Saudi Arabia, which is scheduled to open soon.\nCapital Allocation\nThe Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.29 per share on the Company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on May 22, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 10, 2018.\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 0.7 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $34.9 million.\nConference Call and Webcast\nThe Company will hold a conference call to review its results for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 today at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time. The conference call will be webcast live on the Company’s website at investors.thecheesecakefactory.com and a replay of the webcast will be available through May 25, 2018.\nAbout The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated\nThe Cheesecake Factory Incorporated created the upscale casual dining segment in 1978 with the introduction of its namesake concept.
