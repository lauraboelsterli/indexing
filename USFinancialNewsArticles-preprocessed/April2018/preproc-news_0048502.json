    "text": "DALLAS, April 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Lennox International Inc. (NYSE: LII) today reported financial results for the first quarter of 2018. All comparisons are to the prior-year period. Adjusted revenue and profit exclude the non-core Refrigeration businesses in Australia, Asia and South America that are in the process of being divested, as previously announced. These businesses totaled $47 million of revenue and $2 million of profit in the first quarter of 2018.\nFor the company overall, GAAP revenue was up 5% to a first-quarter record $835 million. Adjusted revenue was up 6% to a first-quarter record $788 million. At constant currency, both GAAP and adjusted revenue were up 4%.\nGAAP operating income was $53 million in the first quarter, including $13 million in pre-tax charges for the write-down of assets and divestiture costs associated with the Australia and Asia transaction. GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.90, including $0.30 in charges for the write-down of assets and divestiture costs associated with the Australia and Asia transaction. On an adjusted basis, total segment profit increased 12% to a first-quarter record $69 million. Total segment margin expanded 50 basis points to a first-quarter record 8.8%. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations rose 33% to a first-quarter record $1.13.\n\"Lennox International posted another record first quarter on the strength of our Residential business, which hit new first-quarter highs for revenue, margin and profit,\" said Chairman and CEO Todd Bluedorn. \"Residential revenue was up 8% led by growth in replacement business. Residential profit rose 21%, and segment margin expanded 120 basis points to 11.3%. Our Commercial business set new first-quarter records for revenue and profit. Commercial revenue was up 3% at constant currency, led by growth in regional and local replacement business, and profit rose 2%. Segment margin of 9.5% was off 30 basis points from the record first-quarter level a year ago. In Refrigeration, revenue was down 5% at constant currency, segment margin was down 100 basis points to 7.4%, and profit declined 14%. In North America, refrigeration systems revenue was relatively flat while display case revenue was down from a year ago. Europe saw strong mid-teens growth in the quarter.\n\"Overall for the company, the first quarter was a record start to the year. As we enter our largest seasonal period, we continue to expect another record year with strong growth and profitability. With a strong balance sheet, and as we close on the sale of our non-core Refrigeration properties, the company will remain focused on driving shareholder value with continued investments in the business, growing the dividend, and repurchasing company stock.\"\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nRevenue: On a GAAP basis, revenue was a first-quarter record $835 million, up 5%. Foreign exchange was a 1% benefit to revenue growth. On an adjusted basis, revenue was a first-quarter record $788 million, up 6%. Foreign exchange was a 2% benefit to adjusted revenue growth. Volume and price were up, and mix was neutral.\nGross Profit: On a GAAP basis, gross profit was $223 million, up 6%. Gross margin was 26.7%, up 10 basis points. On an adjusted basis, gross profit was $210 million, up 7%. Adjusted gross margin was 26.6%, up 30 basis points. GAAP and adjusted gross profit were positively impacted by higher volume, favorable price, sourcing and engineering-led cost reductions, favorable foreign exchange, and lower warranty and other product costs. Partial offsets included unfavorable mix, higher commodity and freight costs, lower factory absorption, and distribution investments.\nIncome from Continuing Operations: On a GAAP basis, income from continuing operations for the first quarter was $37.9 million, or $0.90 per share, compared to $43.5 million, or $1.00 per share, in the prior-year quarter.\nAdjusted income from continuing operations in the first quarter was $47.3 million, or $1.13 per share, compared to $36.8 million, or $0.85 per share, in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 excludes net after-tax charges of $9.4 million: a $10.3 million asset write-down and a charge of $1.9 million for divestiture costs associated with the Australia and Asia transaction, $1.5 million for asbestos-related litigation, $1.3 million for various other items, net, a benefit of $4.3 million for excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, and a profit of $1.3 million for non-core business results.\nCash from Operations, Free Cash Flow and Total Debt: Net cash used in operations in the first quarter was $83 million compared to $108 million in the prior-year quarter. Capital expenditures were $23 million compared to $25 million in the prior-year quarter. Free cash flow was approximately ($106) million compared to approximately ($132) million in the first quarter a year ago. Total debt at the end of the first quarter was $1.289 billion. Total cash and cash equivalents were $57 million at the end of March. In the first quarter, the company paid approximately $21 million in dividends and $150 million for stock repurchases.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS\nResidential Heating & Cooling\nRevenue in the Residential Heating & Cooling business segment rose 8% to a first-quarter record $454 million. Foreign exchange was neutral on a revenue basis. Segment profit was a first-quarter record $51 million, up 21%. Segment margin was a first-quarter record 11.3%, up 120 basis points. Results were positively impacted by higher volume and factory productivity, favorable price and mix, and sourcing and engineering-led cost reductions. Partial offsets included higher commodity and freight costs, higher SG&A, and distribution investments.\nCommercial Heating & Cooling\nRevenue in the Commercial Heating & Cooling business segment was a first-quarter record $206 million, up 5%. At constant currency, revenue was up 3%. Segment profit was a first-quarter record $20 million, up 2%. Segment margin was 9.5%, down 30 basis points from the first-quarter record a year ago. Results were positively impacted by higher volume, higher price, sourcing and engineering-led cost reductions, lower other product costs, and lower SG&A. Partial offsets included unfavorable mix, higher commodity and freight costs, and distribution investments.\nRefrigeration\nOn an adjusted basis for the Refrigeration business segment, revenue was $129 million, down 2%. At constant currency, revenue was down 5%. Segment profit was down 14% to $10 million. Segment margin was down 100 basis points to 7.4%. Results were negatively impacted by lower volume and factory absorption, and higher commodity costs. Partial offsets included higher price, sourcing and engineering-led cost reductions, lower other products costs, and lower SG&A.\nFULL-YEAR OUTLOOK\nUpdating 2018 guidance for GAAP and adjusted revenue growth from 3-7% with a minimal impact from foreign exchange to 4-8% with a positive 1% impact from foreign exchange. Updating 2018 guidance for GAAP EPS from continuing operations from $9.75-$10.35 to $8.79-$9.39, incorporating first-quarter results that included $0.30 in charges for the write-down of assets and divestiture costs associated with the Australia and Asia transaction, as well as expected second-quarter non-cash charges totaling approximately $0.73, or approximately $30 million, associated with the divestiture of the South American business. In the second quarter, the company obtained board approval and signed an agreement with Elgin SA, a private Brazilian company, for the sale of our South American business, subject to Brazilian anti-trust approval, and expects the transaction to close later this year. Reiterating 2018 adjusted EPS from continuing operations guidance of $9.75-$10.35. Reiterating corporate expense guidance of approximately $85 million. Reiterating guidance for an effective tax rate of 22-24% on an adjusted basis for the full year. Reiterating capital expenditures of approximately $100 million. Reiterating guidance for $350 million of stock repurchases in 2018 and a weighted average diluted share count of 41-42 million shares on a full-year basis.\nCONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION\nA conference call to discuss the company's first-quarter results will be held this morning at 8:30 a.m. Central time.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nReconciliation to U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) Measures\n(Unaudited, in millions, except per share and ratio data)\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements and segment net sales and profit presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, additional non-GAAP financial measures are provided and reconciled in the following tables. In addition to these non-GAAP measures, the Company also provides rates of revenue change at constant currency on a consolidated and segment basis if different than the reported measures. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with the GAAP financial measures, provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the ability of investors to analyze the Company's business trends and operating performance. In the first quarter of 2018, the Company announced the planned sales of its businesses in Australia, Asia, and South America. The results from operations for these businesses have been shown in the tables below as \"Non-core business results\". The prior period results have been updated to provide period-over-period comparability.\nReconciliation of Income from Continuing Operations, a GAAP measure, to Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations, a Non-GAAP measure\nFor the Three Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nPre-Tax\nTax Impact (e)\nAfter Tax\nPre-Tax\nTax Impact (e)\nAfter Tax\nIncome from continuing operations, a GAAP measure\n$\n44.0\n$\n(6.1)\n$\n37.9\n$\n53.4\n$\n(9.9)\n$\n43.5\nRestructuring charges\n0.9\n(0.3)\n0.6\n0.1\n—\n0.1\nLoss on assets held for sale\n10.3\n—\n10.3\n—\n—\n—\nSpecial legal contingency charges (a)\n0.2\n(0.1)\n0.1\n0.9\n—\n0.9\nAsbestos-related litigation (a)\n2.1\n(0.6)\n1.5\n1.7\n(0.6)\n1.1\nNet change in unrealized losses (gains) on unsettled future contracts (a)\n1.1\n(0.2)\n0.9\n0.7\n(0.3)\n0.4\nInventory write down, (b)\n0.1\n—\n0.1\n—\n—\n—\nEnvironmental liabilities (a)\n0.3\n—\n0.3\n0.5\n(0.2)\n0.3\nExcess tax benefits from share-based compensation (c)\n—\n(4.3)\n(4.3)\n—\n(7.4)\n(7.4)\nOther tax items, net (c)\n—\n(0.9)\n(0.9)\n—\n—\n—\nDivestiture costs (a)\n2.5\n(0.6)\n1.9\n—\n—\n—\nOther items, net (a)\n0.3\n(0.1)\n0.2\n—\n—\n—\nNon-core business results (f)\n(1.7)\n0.4\n(1.3)\n(2.8)\n0.7\n(2.1)\nAdjusted income from continuing operations, a non-GAAP measure\n$\n60.1\n$\n(12.8)\n$\n47.3\n$\n54.5\n$\n(17.7)\n$\n36.8\nEarnings per share from continuing operations - diluted, a GAAP measure\n$\n0.90\n$\n1.00\nRestructuring charges\n0.01\n—\nLoss on assets held for sale\n0.25\n—\nSpecial legal contingency charges (a)\n—\n0.02\nAsbestos-related litigation (a)\n0.04\n0.03\nNet change in unrealized losses (gains) on unsettled future contracts (a)\n0.02\n0.01\nInventory write down (b)\n—\n—\nEnvironmental liabilities (a)\n0.01\n0.01\nExcess tax benefits from share-based compensation (c)\n(0.10)\n(0.17)\nOther tax items, net (c)\n(0.02)\n—\nDivestiture costs (a)\n0.05\n—\nOther items, net (a)\n—\n—\nNon-core business results (f)\n(0.03)\n(0.05)\nChange in share counts from share-based compensation (d)\n—\n—\nAdjusted earnings per share from continuing operations - diluted, a non-GAAP measure\n$\n1.13\n$\n0.85\n(a)\nRecorded in Losses and other expenses, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(b)\nRecorded in Cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(c)\nRecorded in Provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations\n(d)\nThe impact of excess tax benefits from the change in share-based compensation also impacts our diluted share counts.
