    "text": "April 3, 2018 / 6:15 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Zambia ends ban on South African food imports, except those linked to listeria Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLUSAKA (Reuters) - Zambia on Tuesday lifted a ban on imported food from South Africa except “risky food” from units of Tiger Brands and RCL Foods that have been linked to a listeria outbreak that has killed 180 people since early 2017. FILE PHOTO: A worker looks at empty shelves after removing processed meat products at a Pick n Pay Store in Johannesburg, South Africa, March 5, 2018. REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko/File Photo \nHealth Minister Chitalu Chilufya said the ban was lifted on most food after tests had not revealed the presence of listeria but would still keep a ban on risky foods from Enterprise Food and Rainbow Enterprises.
