    "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C., April 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Nucor Corporation (NYSE: NUE) announced today consolidated net earnings of $354.2 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018. By comparison, Nucor reported consolidated net earnings of $383.9 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $356.9 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017.\n\"Nucor's disciplined strategy for profitable growth is working,\" said John Ferriola, Nucor's Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President. \"Our 2017 earnings were Nucor's highest annual earnings since the cyclical peak year of 2008. The positive momentum has clearly carried over into 2018, as evidenced by our strong first quarter earnings and a bullish second quarter outlook.\"\nSelected Segment Data\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company began reporting its tubular products and piling businesses as part of the steel products segment. These businesses were previously included in the steel mills segment. All prior period segment data presented in this release has been recast to reflect this change. Earnings (loss) before income taxes and noncontrolling interests by segment were as follows for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nThree Months (13 Weeks) Ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nApril 1, 2017\nSteel mills\n$ 560,503\n$ 644,183\nSteel products\n85,814\n66,919\nRaw materials\n74,547\n26,391\nCorporate/eliminations\n(204,952)\n(188,518)\n$ 515,912\n$ 548,975\nFinancial Review\nIncluded in the first quarter of 2018 results was an expense of $21.8 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, related to the write off of deferred tax assets due to the change in the tax status of a subsidiary. Included in the fourth quarter of 2017 results was a net benefit of $175.2 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, related to the impacts of U.S. federal tax legislation enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017. Included in the first quarter of 2017 results were inventory related purchase accounting charges of $9.8 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, associated with the recent acquisitions of Southland Tube and Republic Conduit.\nNucor's consolidated net sales increased 9% to $5.57 billion in the first quarter of 2018 compared with $5.09 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased 16% compared with $4.82 billion in the first quarter of 2017. Average sales price per ton in the first quarter of 2018 increased 3% compared with the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased 9% compared with the first quarter of 2017. Total tons shipped to outside customers were 6,967,000 tons in the first quarter of 2018, a 6% increase from both the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2017. Total steel mill shipments in the first quarter of 2018 increased 8% from the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased 7% from the first quarter of 2017. Downstream steel products shipments to outside customers in the first quarter of 2018 increased 1% from the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased 15% from the first quarter of 2017.\nThe average scrap and scrap substitute cost per ton used during the first quarter of 2018 was $337, a 6% increase compared to $317 in the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of 19% compared to $284 in the first quarter of 2017.\nOverall operating rates at our steel mills increased to 92% in the first quarter of 2018 as compared to 82% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 88% in the first quarter of 2017.\nTotal steel mill energy costs in the first quarter of 2018 increased approximately $1 per ton compared to both the fourth quarter of 2017 and first quarter of 2017 due to higher electricity unit costs.\nOur liquidity position remains strong with $760.0 million in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we amended and extended our untapped $1.5 billion revolving credit facility to mature in April 2023.\nRecent Developments\nIn February 2018, Nucor's board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.38 per share payable on May 11, 2018 to stockholders of record on March 29, 2018. This dividend is Nucor's 180th consecutive quarterly cash dividend, a record we expect to continue.\nIn March 2018, Nucor announced plans to build a rebar micro mill in Frostproof, Florida, which is located in Polk County. The micro mill is a $240 million investment that will have an estimated annual capacity of 350,000 tons and employ approximately 250 people. We anticipate the project will take approximately two years to complete. This location will provide a logistical advantage to Nucor and allow us to capitalize on a currently abundant supply of scrap, a good portion of which is handled by our scrap business, The David J. Joseph Company. This is the second rebar micro mill Nucor is constructing.\nFirst Quarter of 2018 Analysis\nAs expected, earnings in the steel mills segment in the first quarter of 2018 improved compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 due to higher selling prices and increased volumes for all of our steel mill products. The profitability of the steel products segment in the first quarter of 2018 decreased compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 due to typical seasonality. The performance of the raw materials segment improved from the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the much improved performance of our scrap processing operations as well as our direct reduced iron (DRI) facilities.\nSecond Quarter of 2018 Outlook\nEarnings in the second quarter of 2018 are expected to increase significantly compared to the first quarter of 2018. It is worth noting that steel mill metal margins and profits in March were by far the strongest in the first quarter of 2018. The performance of the steel mills segment is expected to improve in the second quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 as we continue to experience the benefit of announced price increases. We believe there is sustainable strength in steel end use markets, and we are encouraged by recent actions by the government to address the massive flood of dumped and illegally subsidized imports into the United States. We believe broad-based tariffs with few exceptions are needed to address the historic volume of unfairly traded imports and transshipping that is done to avoid trade duties. We expect improved performance for our steel products segment in the second quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 as rising steel input costs are being passed on to customers.\nAbout Nucor\nNucor and its affiliates are manufacturers of steel products, with operating facilities primarily in the U.S. and Canada.
