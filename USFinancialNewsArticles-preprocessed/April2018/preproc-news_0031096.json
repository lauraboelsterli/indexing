    "text": "WEST POINT, Va., April 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nC&F Financial Corporation (the Corporation) (NASDAQ:CFFI), the one-bank holding company for C&F Bank (the Bank), today reported net income of $3.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, or $1.11 per common share assuming dilution, compared with $2.7 million, or $0.78 per common share assuming dilution, for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe Corporation’s annualized returns on average common equity (ROE) and on average assets (ROA) for the first quarter of 2018 were 11.05 percent and 1.04 percent, respectively, compared to 7.86 percent and 0.76 percent, respectively, for the first quarter of 2017. The increases in ROE and ROA for the first quarter of 2018, compared to the first quarter of 2017, resulted from higher earnings.\n“We are very pleased to report a $1.2 million, or 43 percent, increase in net income for the first quarter of 2018 over the first quarter of 2017,” said Tom Cherry, President of C&F Financial Corporation. “While a portion of the increase was attributable to the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate beginning in 2018, pre-tax income for each of our major business segments increased by at least 20 percent. These increases were driven by loan growth at the retail banking segment, higher loan production at the mortgage banking segment and lower net charge-offs at the consumer finance segment.”\nRetail Banking Segment. C&F Bank, which comprises the retail banking segment, reported net income of $2.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to net income of $1.8 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nPositive factors influencing net income of the retail banking segment for the first quarter of 2018 included: (1) the effect of loan growth on interest income, as average loans at C&F Bank increased $38.2 million or 5.5 percent during the first quarter of 2018 over the first quarter of 2017, (2) higher net accretion of acquisition accounting adjustments and (3) a decline in the provision for loan losses attributable to the improvement in nonperforming assets. Partially offsetting these factors were (1) a decline in the yield on the investment portfolio due to the reinvestment of proceeds from higher-yielding matured and called securities in securities at relatively lower rates and (2) higher operating expenses associated with strengthening C&F Bank’s technology infrastructure, expanding its product offerings and promoting brand awareness.\nThe first quarter results for 2018 and 2017 for the retail banking segment included the acquisition accounting adjustments recorded in connection with the 2013 acquisition of Central Virginia Bank. The net accretion attributable to these adjustments was $829,000 ($655,000 net of taxes) for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $324,000 ($214,000 net of taxes) for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in 2018 was due to higher accretion of the acquisition discount on purchased credit impaired loans resulting from pay-offs and the collection of amounts charged off prior to acquisition.\nC&F Bank’s total nonperforming assets were $3.9 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $5.4 million at December 31, 2017. Nonperforming assets at March 31, 2018 consisted primarily of $3.7 million in nonaccrual loans, compared to $5.3 million at December 31, 2017. The decline in nonaccrual loans during the first quarter of 2018 resulted primarily from a partial repayment of one commercial relationship from the sale of a portion of the collateral.\nMortgage Banking Segment. C&F Mortgage Corporation, which comprises the mortgage banking segment, reported net income of $435,000 for the first quarter of 2018, compared to net income of $297,000 for the first quarter of 2017.\nPositive factors influencing net income of the mortgage banking segment for the first quarter of 2018 included a 2.0 percent increase in loan production, coupled with an increase in sales margins, which resulted in higher gains on sales of loans.\nConsumer Finance Segment. C&F Finance Company, which comprises the consumer finance segment, reported net income of $1.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to net income of $942,000 for the first quarter of 2017.\nPositive factors influencing net income of the consumer finance segment for the first quarter of 2018 included: (1) a $1.0 million decline in the provision for loan losses and (2) lower personnel and operating expenses resulting from underwriting efficiencies and the purchase of loans with higher credit metrics. Partially offsetting these factors were (1) lower interest income attributable to a decline in average loans and (2) net interest margin compression attributable to (a) lower loan yields resulting from competition in the non-prime automobile loan business and the acquisition of loan contracts with higher credit metrics and (b) higher-cost variable-rate borrowings resulting from increases in short-term interest rates since the first quarter of 2017.\nThe annualized net charge-off ratio for the first quarter of 2018 was 4.69 percent, compared to 6.87 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 6.07 percent for the first quarter of 2017. The decline reflects a lower number of charge-offs during the first quarter of 2018. At March 31, 2018, total delinquent loans as a percentage of total loans was 3.31 percent, compared to 5.17 percent at December 31, 2017 and 3.34 percent at March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, repossessed vehicles available for sale totaled $290,000, compared to $250,000 at December 31, 2017 and $417,000 at March 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses was $24.2 million, or 8.29 percent of total loans, at March 31, 2018, compared $24.4 million, or 8.34 percent of total loans, at December 31, 2017. Management believes the lower number of charge-offs is indicative of overall improvement in the credit quality of the portfolio thus far in 2018. However, if factors influencing the consumer finance segment result in a higher net charge-off ratio in the future, or if the consumer finance segment’s loan portfolio should grow, the segment may need to increase the level of its allowance for loan losses, which would negatively affect future earnings.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, C&F Finance Company began the expansion of its indirect lending programs to include boats and recreational vehicles (RVs), which are prime contracts priced at rates lower than its non-prime automobile portfolio. While these loans may contribute to net interest margin compression in future periods, management expects they will require a lower allowance for loan losses and provisions for loan losses than the consumer finance segment’s non-prime automobile loans.\nOther Segments. Other segments, which principally includes the Corporation’s holding company operations and wealth management subsidiary, reported an aggregate net loss of $353,000 for the first quarter of 2018, compared to a net loss of $330,000 for the first quarter of 2017. The higher net loss during the first quarter of 2018, compared to the first quarter of 2017, included higher operating expenses at the holding company, which were offset in part by higher earnings at the Corporation’s wealth management subsidiary.\nCapital and Dividends. The Corporation declared a quarterly cash dividend of 34 cents per share during the first quarter of 2018, which was paid on April 1, 2018. This dividend equates to a payout ratio of 30.6 percent of first quarter earnings per share. The Board of Directors of the Corporation continually reviews the amount of cash dividends per share and the resulting dividend payout ratio in light of changes in economic conditions, current and future capital requirements, and expected future earnings.\nAbout C&F Financial Corporation.

The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation conform to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States and prevailing practices in the banking industry. However, certain non-GAAP measures are used by management to supplement the evaluation of the Corporation’s performance. These include the following fully-taxable equivalent (FTE) measures: interest income on loans-FTE, interest income on securities-FTE, total interest income-FTE and net interest income-FTE.\nManagement believes that FTE measures provide users of the Corporation’s financial information a presentation of the performance of interest earning assets on a basis that is comparable within the banking industry. Management reviews interest income of the Corporation on an FTE basis. In this non-GAAP presentation, interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt interest income on an equivalent before-tax basis. This measure ensures the comparability of net interest income arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP-basis financial statements, and other bank holding companies may define or calculate these or similar measures differently. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures used by the Corporation to evaluate and measure the Corporation’s performance to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is presented below.\nForward-Looking Statements.
