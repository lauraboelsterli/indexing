    "text": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Two Harbors Investment Corp . (NYSE: TWO) (“Two Harbors”), a leading hybrid mortgage real estate investment trust (“REIT”), and CYS Investments, Inc . (NYSE: CYS) (“CYS”), an Agency mortgage REIT, announced today that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Two Harbors will acquire CYS.\nIn connection with the merger, CYS stockholders will exchange their shares of CYS common stock for newly issued shares of Two Harbors common stock as well as aggregate cash consideration of $15,000,000. The number of Two Harbors shares issued will be based on an exchange ratio to be determined by dividing 96.75% of CYS’ adjusted book value per share by 94.20% of Two Harbors’ adjusted book value per share. For illustrative purposes, assuming the merger occurs and the exchange ratio was based on March 31, 2018 adjusted book value per share, CYS stockholders would receive $7.79 of combined cash and stock consideration per share of CYS common stock owned, which represents a premium of approximately 17.7% over the CYS closing price per share on April 25, 2018. The actual exchange ratio for the merger will be publicly announced at least five business days prior to the required stockholder votes on the merger.\nTwo Harbors and CYS will hold a joint conference call at 9:00 A.M. Eastern Time on April 26, 2018 to discuss the merger. To participate in the teleconference, please call toll-free (877) 868-1835, Conference Code 7197703, (or (914) 495-8581 for international callers) approximately 10 minutes prior to the above start time. You may also listen to the teleconference live via the Internet and review related materials at www.twoharborsinvestment.com in the Investor Relations section under the Events and Presentations link.\nAnticipated Benefits to Two Harbors Stockholders from the Merger\nAdditional capital supports continued growth in target assets: A larger capital base will support the continued growth across Two Harbors’ target assets, and positions Two Harbors to take advantage of market opportunities as they arise. Improved cost structure: Expect that the combination of Two Harbors and CYS will create cost efficiencies and decrease Two Harbors’ other operating expense ratio by 30 to 40 basis points. Additionally PRCM Advisers’ agreement to reduce its base management fee on the new CYS equity will further enhance operating cost efficiencies in the year following the close of the transaction. Expect to maintain $0.47 per share quarterly dividend: Following the close of the transaction, Two Harbors anticipates that its current quarterly dividend of $0.47 will be sustainable through 2018, subject to market conditions and the discretion and approval of Two Harbors’ Board of Directors. Enhanced scale and liquidity with potential for premium valuation: With a pro forma equity base of nearly $5.0 billion, Two Harbors stockholders will benefit from the scale, liquidity and capital alternatives of a larger combined company. Additionally, larger capitalized mortgage REITs have historically carried premium valuations. Anticipate improved Agency spreads in 2018: If so, Two Harbors believes this deal will be accretive to earnings and endorses the capital raising attendant to this transaction.\nAnticipated Benefits to CYS Stockholders from the Merger\nEnhanced scale and liquidity: CYS stockholders will benefit from increased operating scale, liquidity and capital alternatives available to a larger combined company. Meaningful premium to CYS stockholders: Based on March 31, 2018 adjusted book values per share, CYS stockholders would receive $7.79 of combined cash and stock consideration per share of CYS common stock, which represents a premium of approximately 17.7% over the CYS closing price per share on April 25, 2018. Benefit from a more diversified business model: Two Harbors’ hybrid business model is positioned to withstand periods of market volatility and is comprised of a mix of asset classes and a platform that is challenging to replicate. Two Harbors’ portfolio includes a Rates strategy comprised of Agency RMBS paired with mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”), and a Credit strategy, comprised primarily of deeply discounted, legacy non-Agency RMBS. Strong stewards of capital: Two Harbors has a history of being strong stewards of its stockholders’ capital. Since 2009, Two Harbors has outperformed its peer group and has grown its book value with less volatility. Additionally, Two Harbors has a stock repurchase program in place to support its stock.\nAbout the Merger\nUpon the closing of the merger, CYS stockholders will exchange their shares of CYS common stock for newly issued shares of Two Harbors common stock as well as aggregate cash consideration of $15,000,000, payable to CYS stockholders on a pro rata basis.\nThe number of Two Harbors shares to be received by CYS stockholders will be based on an exchange ratio to be determined by dividing 96.75% of the CYS adjusted book value per share by 94.20% of the Two Harbors adjusted book value per share. As defined in the Merger Agreement, adjusted book value per share for each company means (i) such company’s total consolidated common stockholders’ equity after giving pro forma effect to any dividends or other distributions for which the record date is after the exchange ratio determination date but prior to the closing of the merger and as modified for potential transaction-related adjustments, divided by (ii) each respective company’s number of shares of common stock issued and outstanding, including shares issuable upon the vesting of restricted stock.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the adjusted book value per share for Two Harbors and CYS, on a pro forma basis, would have been $15.63 and $7.41, respectively, representing an exchange ratio of 0.4872x, with each share of CYS being exchanged for 0.4872 shares of Two Harbors. For illustrative purposes, under a pro forma exchange ratio, assuming the merger occurs and the exchange ratio was calculated as of March 31, 2018, CYS stockholders would receive approximately 75.7 million Two Harbors shares (representing approximately 30% of the Two Harbors’ total outstanding shares immediately following the merger), which, in combination with the cash consideration of $15,000,000, would value CYS at approximately $7.79 per share of common stock. This valuation represents a premium of approximately 17.7% above the closing price per share of CYS common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on April 25, 2018.\nThe actual exchange ratio for the merger will be publicly announced at least five business days prior to the required stockholder votes on the merger.\nIn connection with the merger, PRCM Advisers LLC, Two Harbors’ external manager, a subsidiary of Pine River Capital Management L.P., has agreed to reduce the base management fee it charges Two Harbors with respect to the additional equity under management resulting from the merger from 1.5% of Stockholders’ Equity on an annualized basis to 0.75% through the first anniversary of the closing of the merger. PRCM Advisers LLC will also make a one-time downward adjustment of $15,000,000 to the management fees payable by Two Harbors for the quarter in which the merger closes. PRCM Advisers has also agreed to a post-closing downward adjustment of up to $3.3 million to reimburse Two Harbors for certain transaction related expenses.\nIn addition to the above consideration, Two Harbors would assume the existing notional $75 million in CYS 7.75% Series A cumulative redeemable preferred stock and $200 million in CYS 7.50% Series B cumulative redeemable preferred stock.\nFollowing the closing of the transaction, all senior management positions will continue to be led by Two Harbors’ personnel and Two Harbors Board of Directors will be expanded to include two additional independent directors from CYS Investments’ current board, James Stern and Karen Hammond.\nThe completion of the merger is subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions, and is subject to the approval of the stockholders of both Two Harbors and CYS. The companies expect the transaction to close in the third quarter of 2018.\n“We are pleased to announce the acquisition of CYS Investments, which we believe represents a unique opportunity to create value for our stockholders,” stated Thomas Siering, Two Harbors’ President and Chief Executive Officer. “This transaction offers Two Harbors stockholders the opportunity to benefit from additional capital, supporting continued growth in our target assets, as well as an improved cost structure. The combination of the two companies also supports the potential for the premium valuation of a pro forma Two Harbors.”\n“We are excited about the opportunity to merge with Two Harbors and believe that our stockholders will benefit from the increased scale, diversification and liquidity of the combined companies,” stated Kevin Grant, CYS Investments’ Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Investment Officer. “Two Harbors has a long history of being strong stewards of capital and we believe this transaction should enhance value for our stockholders over the long-term.”\nJMP Securities LLC is serving as financial advisor, and Sidley Austin LLP is serving as legal advisor to Two Harbors. Barclays Capital Inc. and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC are serving as financial advisors, and Vinson & Elkins LLP is serving as legal advisor to CYS.\nAdditional Information about the Merger\nThis communication relates to the proposed transaction pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of April 25, 2018, by and among Two Harbors, Eiger Merger Subsidiary LLC and CYS.
