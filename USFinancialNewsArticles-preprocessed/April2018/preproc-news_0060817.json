When I say serious players, the most obvious thing to think of is airlines,” Kjos said.\n“But there could also be others, as we’ve had multiple players showing interest. They are very serious players,” he added.\nKjos also told reporters he would prefer not to sell his stake until the company’s intercontinental business has demonstrated its potential, while adding that he was unlikely to block a sale if the board were to “strongly recommend” a bid.
