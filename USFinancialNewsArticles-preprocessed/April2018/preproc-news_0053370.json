    "text": "April 26, 2018 / 8:02 AM / Updated 11 minutes ago EU starts surveillance of imports of aluminium after U.S. tariffs Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union has started surveillance of imports of aluminium as U.S. tariffs threaten a further surge of the metal coming into Europe, the EU official journal said on Thursday. FILE PHOTO: Pieces of aluminium are pictured in Mostar, October 12, 2011. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic\nThe data collected on the quantity and value of incoming aluminium products will help the bloc determine whether it needs measures to limit imports.\nThe European Commission began an investigation last month to assess the need for potential “safeguard” measures for steel.\nThe United States imposed import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium in March, although the European Union and six other countries secured temporary exemptions.
