    "text": "Leading Connectivity Provider, MMB Networks, Joins the Zigbee Alliance Board of Directors and Its Mission to Enable All Objects to Connect and Interact, Improving the Way the World Lives, Works and Plays\nDAVIS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- The Zigbee Alliance , a global association of companies creating, evolving, and promoting universal open standards for the Internet of Things (IoT), today announced that MMB Networks — a leader in IoT enablement — has elevated its membership in the Alliance to the Promoter level, and been appointed to its Board of Directors. As an active leader in the Alliance for many years and a venture-backed company whose customers include major brands and innovators from across the IoT, MMB is an important addition to the experience and diversity of the Zigbee Alliance Board .\nHeadquartered in Toronto, Canada, MMB Networks is an IoT integrator that works with leading and innovative companies to solve their complex connectivity challenges. MMB's hardware, software and expertise — powered by its RapidConnect interoperability platform — enable customers to rapidly integrate wireless connectivity and interoperability into IoT products so they can focus resources on innovating and creating unique value for their users. MMB’s Zigbee and Dotdot portfolios include wireless modules, gateways, embedded software, and development tools that have enabled customers to create products in a number of markets including utility and smart energy, solar, commercial lighting, and smart home.\n“MMB’s mission is to accelerate innovation and adoption in the IoT — a goal we share with the Zigbee Alliance,” said Daniel Moneta, co-founder and CMO of MMB Networks. “From PCs to the Internet to smartphones, every major acceleration of innovation has been enabled by the availability of common platforms that anyone could innovate on top of. Too often, IoT development efforts are invested in simply getting objects to connect to each other in proprietary ways, limiting the scale of innovation and consuming resources that should be focused on creating new value for users. The Zigbee Alliance has created and continues to evolve that common platform for innovation in the IoT with technologies like Zigbee and Dotdot that enable all objects to connect and interact. MMB has seen the power of these technologies drive growth for our customers, and for us. In joining the board, we recommit our efforts to MMB’s and the Alliance’s shared vision.”\n“As an IoT startup, Zigbee Certified product developer, and integrator that has helped enable and drive Zigbee adoption, MMB brings to the Board of Directors its unique perspective on the opportunities and challenges for many important industry stakeholders,” said John E. Osborne II, Chairman of the Board for the Zigbee Alliance and Vice President IoT, Sales and Marketing at LEEDARSON . “MMB’s own growth in the time they’ve been Zigbee Alliance members represents the opportunities for companies that embrace open, global technologies, and the momentum that is attracting companies from across the industry to collaborate on a more unified and interoperable IoT.”\n“MMB Networks has been a significant leader in the Zigbee Alliance for more than ten years, and not only demonstrates exceptional expertise in the technologies driving the IoT, but also has an enthusiastic vision for its potential, passionately advocating for both innovators and users,” said Tobin Richardson, President and CEO, Zigbee Alliance. “MMB has been instrumental in the development of Zigbee and Dotdot specifications, the Alliance’s liaison with the Thread Group , and in promoting the Alliance’s vision of unifying the IoT through open, global standards. Their addition to our Board of Directors further strengthens our capacity to deliver on that vision.”\nMMB Networks joins Comcast , Huawei , Itron Inc. , The Kroger Co. , Landis+Gyr , LEEDARSON , Legrand Group , Midea Group , NXP Semiconductors , Philips Lighting , Schneider Electric , Silicon Labs , SmartThings , Somfy , Texas Instruments and Wulian on the Zigbee Alliance Board of Directors.\nFor more information about the Zigbee Alliance, its Board of Directors, general membership, and benefits of joining the Alliance, visit www.zigbee.org .\nABOUT MMB NETWORKS\nMMB Networks’ mission is to accelerate innovation and adoption in the IoT.
