FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - International Friendly - Sweden vs Chile - Chile training - Friends Arena, Stockholm, Sweden - March 23, 2018 Chile's national soccer team player Arturo Vidal in action. Jonas Ekstromer/TT News Agency/via REUTERS \nThe 30-year-old Chile international is now sidelined for Tuesday’s German Cup semi-final against Bayer Leverkusen and is also unlikely to make their Champions League semi-final first leg against Real Madrid next week. \nBayern are chasing a treble of titles having already secured the Bundesliga crown. \n“He slipped and turned his knee,” Heynckes said of Vidal’s injury in training on Sunday. \n“I talked with the doctor. He did a scan. Arturo will need to undergo a minor arthroscopic surgery. He is already on his way to Augsburg. He is now ruled out for the short-term for sure.” Reporting by Karolos Grohmann; Editing by Christian Radnedge",
