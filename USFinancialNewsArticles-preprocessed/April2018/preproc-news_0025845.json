The scheme is expected to increase patient numbers at private hospitals such as those run by Manipal and Fortis.\nBut even without it, an under-resourced Indian public health system has helped Fortis - with around 30 hospitals across India - and rival private-healthcare companies such as Manipal and Apollo Hospital Enterprise Ltd grow rapidly in recent years, tapping into demand for better healthcare.\nDeloitte expects India’s healthcare market will grow three-fold to $372 billion by 2022.\nA lack of quality assets in healthcare in India also makes Fortis attractive, a source advising Fortis on the deal said, declining to be named. “A typical greenfield hospital can easily take five years to build and get running (in India)” the source said, adding that new suitors could not be ruled out.\nIn the last few months Fortis has faced investigations by India’s Serious Fraud Investigations Office and the Securities and Exchange Board of India for financial fraud — although Chief Executive Bhavdeep Singh has said he expects the probes to be over in the next 12 months.\nFortis is also saddled with a burgeoning debt pile. Its net debt was 13.39 billion rupees as of Dec. 31, and last month Fortis reported a net loss for the three months ended in September and December.\nIHH, in a letter dated April 11 made public by Fortis on Friday, said it was offering to buy Fortis due to the “inability of the statutory auditors of (Fortis) to opine on its financial position as at Dec. 31, 2017 and regulatory investigations that are currently underway.”\nIt said its offer would be a better option for Fortis shareholders than the Manipal offer, which would involve “complex steps over a prolonged period”.\nManipal, seeking to expand its presence beyond southern India, first offered to buy Fortis last month, proposing a deal that would give control of the combined company to Manipal Chief Executive Ranjan Pai and U.S. buyout firm TPG Capital.\nBut Fortis’s minority shareholders, including billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, said the price was low, forcing Manipal to sweeten the deal, valuing Fortis at 80.39 billion rupees.\nThe regulatory investigations, tightened credit, a lack of liquidity, and a smaller board has “adversely impacted decision-making” at Fortis, IHH said in the letter, and asked Fortis to respond to its offer before April 18.\n$1 = 65.2400 Indian rupees Reporting by Zeba Siddiqui in Mumbai and Nivedita Bhattacharjee; Additional reporting by Krishna Kurup in Bengaluru; Writing by Sayantani Ghosh; editing by David Evans\n ",
