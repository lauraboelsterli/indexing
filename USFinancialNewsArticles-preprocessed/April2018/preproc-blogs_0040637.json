(April 6) AP Richard Clarida, global strategic advisor and managing director of Pacific Investment Management Co LLC (Pimco), speaks during a Bloomberg Television interview in New York, U.S., on Thursday, Oct. 29, 2015. Clarida disscussed the economic impact of China ending its one-child policy and how demographics affect the nation's growth.

The nominees are Richard Clarida, a Columbia University economist and global strategic adviser at bond giant Pimco who was tapped for vice chair, and Michelle Bowman, Kansas bank commissioner, who the president picked for an open governor's spot. Both appointments had been rumored for months and come as Trump is trying to fill four vacancies at the central bank. One nominee, Marvin Goodfriend, faces an uncertain future as the name has been stuck in the Senate for months. Clarida's nominee is key in that he will be the chief deputy for new Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. The position has been vacant since Stanley Fischer left in October. The nomination comes at a critical time as the Fed is in the midst of normalizing policy after the extreme measures taken in the wake of the financial crisis. The Federal Open Market Committee, of which both nominees would be voting members, approved a quarter-point rate hike in March . It was the sixth rate increase since the Fed began normalizing policy in December 2015.",
