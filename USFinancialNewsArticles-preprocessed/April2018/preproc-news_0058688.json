    "text": "SANDUSKY, Ohio, April 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Civista Bancshares, Inc. (NASDAQ: CIVB) (\"Civista\") reported net income available to common shareholders of $6.7 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $4.3 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, for the prior year period. In addition, we issued approximately 1.6 million new shares in February 2017 related to raising $32.8 million of additional capital, net of costs.\n\"The first quarter of 2018 produced very strong results. The increases to our net interest margin and net income show the impact that growth can have on our organization. On March 12 th we announced the acquisition of United Community Bancorp in Lawrenceburg, Indiana. We are excited about our partnership with UCB and the prospects it brings. While our loan balances have backed up a little in the first quarter, our loan production has remained steady. Our loan pipelines remain strong and we are optimistic about our loan production for the remainder of 2018.\" said Dennis G. Shaffer, President and CEO of Civista.\nResults of Operations :\nNet interest income for the first quarter of 2018 increased $1.9 million, or 14.6% compared to the same period of 2017. Interest income increased $2.2 million primarily due to a $79.5 million increase in average loans outstanding, along with a 35 basis point increase in the yield on loans. The yield on interest-earning assets increased across all categories with the exception of non-taxable securities. The reduction in the corporate tax rate was the primary reason for the decrease in the tax-equivalent yield on non-taxable securities.\nInterest expense increased $352 thousand primarily due to an increase in rates of 14 basis points as well as an increase in average balances of $41.8 million. The tax equivalent net interest margin was 4.05% for the first quarter, compared to 3.67% for the same period a year ago.\nAverage Balance Analysis\n(Unaudited - Dollars in thousands except share data)\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nAverage\nYield/\nAverage\nYield/\nAssets:\nbalance\nInterest\nrate *\nbalance\nInterest\nrate *\nInterest-earning assets:\nLoans\n$ 1,147,441\n$ 13,639\n4.82%\n$ 1,067,903\n$ 11,777\n4.47%\nTaxable securities\n140,999\n986\n2.83%\n132,152\n847\n2.62%\nNon-taxable securities\n101,478\n878\n4.53%\n78,810\n712\n5.69%\nInterest-bearing deposits in other banks\n113,025\n421\n1.51%\n188,813\n356\n0.76%\nTotal interest-earning assets\n$ 1,502,943\n15,924\n4.37%\n$ 1,467,678\n13,692\n3.89%\nNoninterest-earning assets:\nCash and due from financial institutions\n90,358\n98,472\nPremises and equipment, net\n17,529\n18,124\nAccrued interest receivable\n4,445\n3,933\nIntangible assets\n28,368\n28,827\nOther assets\n11,243\n10,328\nBank owned life insurance\n25,175\n24,602\nLess allowance for loan losses\n(13,141)\n(13,311)\nTotal Assets\n$ 1,666,920\n$ 1,638,653\nLiabilities and Shareholders' Equity:\nInterest-bearing liabilities:\nDemand and savings\n$ 616,213\n$ 252\n0.17%\n$ 577,809\n$ 123\n0.09%\nTime\n187,391\n455\n0.98%\n189,985\n342\n0.73%\nFHLB\n39,642\n152\n1.56%\n28,440\n88\n1.25%\nSubordinated debentures\n29,427\n288\n3.97%\n29,427\n241\n3.32%\nRepurchase agreements\n18,398\n5\n0.11%\n23,581\n6\n0.10%\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities\n$ 891,071\n1,152\n0.52%\n$ 849,242\n800\n0.38%\nNoninterest-bearing deposits\n576,809\n624,315\nOther liabilities\n14,608\n13,168\nShareholders' equity\n184,432\n151,928\nTotal Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity\n$ 1,666,920\n$ 1,638,653\nNet interest income and interest rate spread\n$ 14,772\n3.85%\n$ 12,892\n3.51%\nNet interest margin\n4.05%\n3.67%\n* - Interest yields are calculated using a 21% tax-equivalent adjustment for 2018 and a 35% tax-equivalent adjustment for 2017\nNo provision for loan losses was made during 2018 and 2017.\nDuring the quarter, noninterest income totaled $5.6 million, an increase of $478 thousand, or 9.3%, compared to the prior year's first quarter.\nNoninterest income\n(unaudited - dollars in thousands)\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nService charges\n$ 1,134\n$ 1,045\nNet gain on sale of securities\n-\n-\nNet gain on equity securities\n40\n-\nNet gain on sale of loans\n333\n257\nATM/Interchange fees\n554\n510\nWealth management fees\n852\n707\nBank owned life insurance\n142\n144\nTax refund processing fees\n2,200\n2,200\nOther\n361\n275\nTotal noninterest income\n$ 5,616\n$ 5,138\nService charge income increased $89 thousand, or 8.5%, for the first quarter primarily due to a change in the business account earnings credits, along with an increase in overdraft charges. Gain on sale of loans increased $76 thousand, or 29.6%, for the first quarter 2018 compared to the same period in 2017. The increase is due to an increase in the volume of loans sold from $12.2 million in 2017 to $14.6 million in 2018. Wealth management fees increased $145 thousand, or 20.5%, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 due primarily to an additional $34.0 million in assets under management compared to the first quarter of 2017. Other income increased $86 thousand for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to an increase in swap fees.\nDuring the quarter, noninterest expense totaled $12.2 million, an increase of $703 thousand, or 6.1%, compared to the prior year's first quarter.\nNoninterest expense\n(unaudited - dollars in thousands)\nThree months ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\nCompensation expense\n$ 7,374\n$ 6,982\nNet occupancy and equipment\n1,135\n987\nContracted data processing\n348\n388\nTaxes and assessments\n469\n422\nProfessional services\n552\n451\nAmortization of intangible assets\n33\n167\nMarketing\n318\n252\nOther\n1,976\n1,853\nTotal noninterest expense\n$ 12,205\n$ 11,502\nCompensation expense increased $392 thousand, or 5.6%, for the first quarter compared to the same period in 2017. The increase in compensation expense is mainly due to a $165 thousand increase in salaries, a $123 thousand increase in commissions and a $145 thousand increase in employee insurance. Net occupancy and equipment expense increased $148, or 15.0%, from the same period of 2017. The increase was attributable to $45 thousand increase in equipment expense, largely related to purchases and maintenance. Grounds maintenance increased $41 thousand and utilities increased $17 thousand, both as a result of the extended winter weather we experienced in our region. Professional services costs increased $101 thousand, or 22.4% for the first quarter 2018, primarily attributable to an $82 thousand increase in consulting fees and a $25 thousand increase in examination fees. Amortization of intangible assets decreased $134 thousand or 80.2% due to the final amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of Futura Banc Corp. Other expenses increased $123 thousand, or 6.6% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 2017, spread across several items.\nThe efficiency ratio was 59.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 62.5% for the three months ended March 31, 2017.\nThe 2018 impact of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act was a reduction of income tax expense of approximately $797 thousand, which increased net income available to common shareholders approximately $0.06 per diluted share.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets increased $74.4 million, or 4.9%, from December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018, primarily due to increased cash balances of $78.5 million, primarily related to the tax refund processing program, offset by a decrease in the loan portfolio of $10.9 million.\nEnd of period loan balances\n(unaudited - dollars in thousands)\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2018\n2017\n$ Change\n% Change\nCommercial and Agriculture\n$ 137,076\n$ 152,473\n$ (15,397)\n-10.1%\nCommercial Real Estate:\nOwner Occupied\n162,985\n164,099\n(1,114)\n-0.7%\nNon-owner Occupied\n436,160\n425,623\n10,537\n2.5%\nResidential Real Estate\n267,430\n268,735\n(1,305)\n-0.5%\nReal Estate Construction\n95,856\n97,531\n(1,675)\n-1.7%\nFarm Real Estate\n37,928\n39,461\n(1,533)\n-3.9%\nConsumer and Other\n16,323\n16,739\n(416)\n-2.5%\nTotal Loans\n$ 1,153,758\n$ 1,164,661\n$ (10,903)\n-0.9%\nThe $10.9 million decrease in the loan portfolio from December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018, was largely due to Commercial and Agriculture loans, however all others categories showed small decreases, with the exception of Commercial Real Estate. During the first quarter we had approximately $76.0 million in loan pay downs and approximately $97.7 million in new loans originated, some of which are lines of credit which have not yet been drawn upon.\nMr. Shaffer continued, \"The prolonged cold weather that we experienced in the first quarter of 2018 slowed some of our lending activity. We expect to see increased activity during the second quarter in both new originations and draws on lines of credit.\"\nTotal deposits increased $85.7 million, or 7.1%, from December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018. The increase was due primarily to the additional cash balances related to the tax refund processing program which increased noninterest-bearing demand accounts $173.3 million. Fewer Brokered deposits were needed resulting in a decrease of $109.4 million.\nEnd of period deposit balances\n(dollars in thousands)\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2018\n2017\n$ Change\n% Change\nNoninterest-bearing demand\n$ 535,225\n$ 361,964\n$ 173,261\n47.9%\nInterest-bearing demand\n202,264\n183,680\n18,584\n10.1%\nSavings and money market\n410,433\n404,690\n5,743\n1.4%\nTime deposits\n136,158\n138,557\n(2,399)\n-1.7%\nBrokered deposits\n6,591\n116,032\n(109,441)\n-94.3%\nTotal Deposits\n$ 1,290,671\n$ 1,204,923\n$ 85,748\n7.1%\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances decreased $11.9 million or 16.6% from December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018, primarily due to reduced funding needs.\nTotal shareholders' equity increased $3.6 million, or 1.9%, from December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018, primarily due to a $6.3 million increase in retained earnings, partially offset by a $2.7 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nAsset Quality\nThe Company recorded net charge-offs of $320 thousand and $5 thousand for the three months ended March 31. 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\n(dollars in thousands)\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nBeginning of period\n$ 13,134\n$ 13,305\nCharge-offs\n(425)\n(131)\nRecoveries\n105\n126\nProvision\n-\n-\nEnd of period\n$ 12,814\n$ 13,300\nThe allowance for loan losses to loans was 1.11% for 2018 and 1.24% for 2017.

The allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans increased to 154.42% from 137.82% in 2017.\nNon-performing assets at March 31, 2018 were $8.3 million, a 13.0% decrease from December 31, 2017.\nNon-performing Assets\n(unaudited - dollars in thousands)\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n2018\n2017\nNon-accrual loans\n$ 5,448\n$ 6,648\nRestructured loans\n2,850\n2,888\nTotal non-performing loans\n8,298\n9,536\nOther Real Estate Owned\n11\n16\nTotal non-performing assets\n$ 8,309\n$ 9,552\nConference Call and Webcast\nCivista Bancshares, Inc. will also host a conference call to discuss the Company's financial results for the first quarter of 2018 at 1:00 p.m. ET on Friday April 27, 2018.
