    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of U.S. states and cities sued the Trump administration to stop it from asking people filling out 2020 census forms whether they are citizens.\nFILE PHOTO: An attendee holds her new country's flag and her naturalization papers as she is sworn in during a U.S. citizenship ceremony in Los Angeles, U.S., July 18, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo The lawsuit by 17 states, Washington D.C. and six cities challenged what they called last week’s “unconstitutional and arbitrary” decision by the U.S. Department of Commerce, which oversees the Census Bureau, to add the citizenship question.\nIt was also a fresh challenge to what New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, at a press conference announcing the lawsuit, called the administration’s “anti-immigrant animus.”\nAll of the states bringing the case have Democratic attorneys general.\nThey were joined by New York City, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle and Providence, Rhode Island, which all have Democratic mayors, and the U.S. Conference of Mayors. Another state, California, filed a similar lawsuit last week.\nThe White House and the Commerce Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nRequired under the U.S. Constitution, the decennial census is used to determine the drawing of political boundaries, the allocation of seats in Congress and at the state and local level, and the annual distribution of about $700 billion of federal funds.\nCritics of the citizenship question say it might dissuade immigrants, and perhaps many citizens, from being counted, with a disproportionate impact on Democratic-leaning states.\nSupporters of the question, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, say it will help the country enforce the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965.\nA citizenship question has not appeared in the census since 1950.\nThe lawsuit accused the Trump Administration of violating the Constitution’s requirement that the government conduct an “actual enumeration” of the “whole number of persons” every 10 years.\nAt the press conference, Schneiderman called the citizenship question a “blatant effort” by the administration to prevent the Census Bureau from doing its job.\n“This is an affront to our national ideals,” Schneiderman said. “This is an affront to the Constitution.”\nThe lawsuit said adding the question could particularly exacerbate undercounting of the fast-growing Hispanic population, after an estimated 1.54 percent undercount in 2010.\nIt also said the question would add fuel to a threat made in Congressional testimony last June by Thomas Homan, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nThe complaint Quote: d Homan telling Congress that undocumented immigrants “should be uncomfortable. You should look over your shoulder. And you need to be worried.”\nReporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Additional reporting by Makini Brice in Washington, D.C.; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Richard Chang\n ",
