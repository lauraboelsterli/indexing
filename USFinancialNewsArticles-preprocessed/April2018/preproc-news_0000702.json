    "text": "Ryan Flaherty came back to haunt his former team, posting his second career four-hit game to pace the Atlanta Braves to a 15-2 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on Saturday at SunTrust Park in Atlanta.\nFlaherty, signed as a free agent this spring after being released by Philadelphia, was 4-for-5 with two doubles and scored four runs. His other four-hit game came Sept. 10, 2014, when he played for Baltimore.\nThe Braves pounded out 19 hits, and each starting position player had at least one hit. Ender Inciarte had three hits and four RBIs, and Nick Markakis, Freddie Freeman, Preston Tucker, Dansby Swanson and Chris Stewart each had two hits.\nThe offensive support made Atlanta starter Brandon McCarthy a winner in his debut with the club. McCarthy (1-0), obtained from Los Angeles in the Matt Kemp trade, pitched 5 1/3 innings and allowed two runs on six hits and three walks. He struck out five and earned his first career victory over the Phillies.\nPhiladelphia starter Vince Velasquez (0-1) pitched 2 2/3 innings and allowed seven runs (four earned) on nine hits and two walks. He struck out four. The Phillies used four relievers and finished the game with outfielder Pedro Florimon pitching the eighth.\nThe Phillies scored two runs in the top of the first, but the Braves scored in six of their eight turns at bat. They scored four runs in the third and five runs in the sixth.\nThe Braves won two of three in the series and have won three consecutive series against Philadelphia.\nThe Braves made a roster move on Saturday, sending left-hander Rex Brothers to Triple-A Gwinnett and signing right-handed reliever Josh Ravin. He pitched a scoreless ninth inning in his Atlanta debut.\nTo make room on the 40-man roster, the Braves designated right-handed reliever Akeel Morris for assignment. Ravin was 0-1 with a 3.86 ERA in seven games for the Braves this spring. He was 0-1 with a 6.48 ERA in 14 games with the Dodgers in 2017.\nâ€”Field Level Media\n ",
