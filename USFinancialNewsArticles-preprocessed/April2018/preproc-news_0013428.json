    "text": "Italy: Eni offices searched in Congo Republic corruption probe April 9th, 2018 Europe \nOffices of Italian oil major Eni (ENI.MI) were searched and documents seized in an investigation by Milan prosecutors into alleged corruption in Congo Republic, the company said on Friday, confirming what two sources had told Reuters. \nProsecutors asked the company on Thursday to hand over documents relating to operations in Congo between 2009 and 2014, an Eni spokesman said by email, adding that Eni had met the request. \nThe state-controlled major, under investigation in a separate case over alleged corruption in Nigeria, said the offices of two employees at the company had been raided, but gave no names. \n  uk.reuters.com",
