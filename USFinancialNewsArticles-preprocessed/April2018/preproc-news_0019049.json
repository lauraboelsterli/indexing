    "text": "April 11, 2018 / 7:39 AM / Updated 3 minutes ago UK's Hammond warns of 'catastrophe' for Ireland if no EU deal: FAZ Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBERLIN (Reuters) - British Finance Minister Philip Hammond told a German newspaper that it would be a “catastrophe” for the situation in Ireland if Britain and the European Union failed to find a solution during talks on Brexit. Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, leaves 11 Downing Street, in central London, Britain March 21, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville \n“The worst result for the Good Friday Agreement would be no solution between the EU and Britain, that would be a catastrophe for the situation in Ireland,” he told Germany’s Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in an interview published on Wednesday. \nHammond did not say whether he was referring specifically to a solution to the Irish border question, or to a comprehensive Brexit deal.
