    "text": "Third baseman Ryan Flaherty hit a three-run homer against his former team to spark the Atlanta Braves to a 7-3 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on Wednesday.\nFlaherty was released by the Phillies during spring training and added to the Braves roster, where he earned the starting job. He connected on his first homer of the season against starter Vince Velasquez (1-2) to drive in Preston Tucker and Dansby Swanson and erase a 1-0 deficit.\nFlaherty was 2-for-4 with four RBI and scored a run to help the Braves take two of three games against the Phillies. Atlanta has won all four of its series played this season at SunTrust Park.\nBrandon McCarthy (3-0) got the win for Atlanta after throwing 5 1/3 solid innings. He allowed one run on five hits and two walks, striking out six.\nVelasquez allowed three runs on seven hits and one walk. He struck out seven.\nAfter four scoreless innings, Philadelphia broke through with a run in the fifth. Velasquez singled home Andrew Knapp to put the Phillies ahead 1-0.\nFlaherty’s blast put Atlanta ahead 3-1, but the Phillies made it 3-2 in the seventh inning when Carlos Santana grounded into a double play that scored Maikel Franco.\nThe Braves answered in the bottom of the seventh when Swanson hit his second home run of the season to left field.\nAtlanta put it away with three runs in the eighth inning. Kurt Suzuki drove in a run with a single, Nick Markakis scored on Hoby Milner’s balk and Flaherty added an RBI single.\nThe Phillies scored a run in the ninth off Braves rookie A.J. Minter, who had not allowed a run all season. Aaron Altherr doubled home Rhys Hoskins, who had walked, to cut the lead to 7-3. Minter retired the next three batters and got Carlos Santana on a fly out to end the game.\nAtlanta slugger Freddie Freeman left the game in the eighth inning when he was hit by a pitch on the wrist.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
