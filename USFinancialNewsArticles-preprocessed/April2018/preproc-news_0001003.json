    "text": "JOHNS CREEK, Ga., April 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ebix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EBIX), a leading international supplier of On-Demand software and E-commerce services to the insurance, financial, e-governance and healthcare industries, today announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire India based CentrumDirect Limited (CDL), the undisputed Leader in India’s Foreign Exchange and outward remittance markets for approximately $175 million. CDL will be tightly integrated into Ebix’s Financial Exchange EbixCash offering in India and abroad, with key CDL business executives becoming an integral part of the combined EbixCash senior leadership.\nThe agreement while approved by the Centrum Board, is subject to its shareholders and other regulatory/commercial approvals. The customary process for such approvals can take a timeline of 45 to 60 days.\nEbix did not use any investment bankers for the transaction. Ebix intends to fund the entire transaction in cash, using its existing bank line and internal cash reserves, though it retains the option at its sole discretion of paying up to $60 million in Ebix stock priced based on the average share price at closing. In the calendar year 2017, CDL had revenues of $37 million and EBITDA margins of approximately 25%. Ebix believes that the business can continue to grow at the rate of 20% plus annually with operating margins of 30% or more, once fully integrated. Ebix expects the acquisition to be immediately accretive to its earnings and forecasts it to generate $0.25 in increased Diluted EPS.\nCDL is an Omni-channel exchange that offers a variety of Foreign Exchange and outward money remittance products targeting niche sectors like leisure travel, corporate travel, overseas education related remittances, airport money exchange including duty free shops, tour cost remittances of travel agents, disbursement of crew wages to ships docked on Indian shores, immigration related remittance, retail and wholesale currency markets. CDL is one of the few named players in India with the requisite AD-II and FMCG regulatory licenses to conduct these businesses through a vast network encompassing 165 outlets spread across 55 cities, 200+ franchisee partners, 2,000+ travel agents, 50+ banks and financial institutions, 1000+ SMEs, and 150+ large corporate clients.\nCDL’s Forex Exchange has an approximate 70% market share of India’s airport Foreign Exchange business encompassing 24 international airports like Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai and Kolkata International airports, while conducting over 1 million transactions per annum. The Company is also in the process of initiating contracts with a number of international airports outside India in countries like Sri Lanka, Singapore, Bangladesh, Maldives and Seychelles to name a few. The CDL Exchange also has a 15% market share in India’s fast growing $1.5 Billion education outward remittance business.\nLeadership in India’s Financial Exchange markets\nThe CDL Exchange establishes EbixCash as a leader in the outward remittance and Forex markets. The CDL Exchange is highly complementary to EbixCash’s Via.com travel exchange offering, because it now allows EbixCash’s travel outlets to sell Forex to its clients buying international travel. The CDL Exchange will bring thousands of travel agents, large corporates, SMEs and new outlets to EbixCash’s existing travel network offering. EbixCash through its travel portal Via.com is one of South East Asia’s leading travel exchanges with over 110,000 distribution outlets and 8,000 corporate clients, processing over 24.5 million transactions every year. CDL’s presence in 24 international airports lends itself well to marketing the EbixCash brand to Indian and international consumers at these airports, besides being a very recurring source of business for EbixCash. The addition of the CDL Exchange further expands EbixCash Financial Exchange’s footprint from its existing 231,500 physical distribution outlets, with an Omni-channel online digital platform that encompasses leadership in money remittance (domestic & international), travel, prepaid & gift cards, utility payments, etc. CDL’s corporate business is highly synergistic with EbixCash’s existing corporate business, as it now provides EbixCash the ability to sell Digital Forex and multicurrency cards, etc. to its existing thousands of corporate clients. EbixCash’s existing corporate clients are presently provided a variety of offerings including utility payments, corporate gifting, cash management, tele-medicine for employees, travel bookings, prepaid gift cards, etc. The addition of the CDL Exchange to the EbixCash portfolio further strengthens Ebix’s leadership in India’s Financial Exchange markets: EbixCash already has a dominant leadership position in the inward remittance exchange arena in India. EbixCash is already the largest domestic remittance exchange in India with domestic remittance volume of approximately $100 million per month. EbixCash is also a recognized leader in prepaid cards, domestic remittances and bill payments, processing approximately 600,000 transactions per day and approximately $2 Billion in annual payment volume. EbixCash is already recognized as a leader in the gift card space with brand gift cards across all categories with 100+ Brand copartners like Amazon, Flipkart.com , Croma, Lifestyle, Big Bazaar, Tanishq, BookMyShow.com , Reliance Digital, MakeMyTrip.com , Café Coffee Day, Pizza Hut, Myntra.com , Pantaloon, etc. EbixCash is a leader in the utility payment space serving as a payment exchange for large utility providers like BSES, Tata Power, NDPL, Reliance Energy Mahanagar Gas, etc. Ebix’s recent joint venture initiative with Bombay Stock Exchange positions it as a gateway for insurance carriers to sell insurance to India’s vast population through EbixCash’s tens of thousands of phygital outlets across the country, besides BSE’s strong network across the country.\nEbix Chairman, President and CEO Robin Raina said, “The acquisition of CDL provides us with new abilities in niche Financial Exchange sectors while expanding our footprint in India and establishing our EbixCash Financial Exchange as the largest Financial Exchange in the country. We have been eager to build a strong footprint in India’s airports and shipping ports, as their high levels of customer traffic provide recurring sources of revenue and income for any Financial Exchange. With a long-term presence in 24 international airports, and a few others to be deployed this year, the addition of CDL will substantially extend EbixCash’s branding and leadership position in India’s Financial Exchange markets.”\nRobin added, “CDL already has a strong financial trajectory in terms of top line and operating margins, though we intend to build upon its success through complementary products and operational synergies. I am particularly pleased that the CDL acquisition will also further strengthen our management resources with the addition of CDL’s strong senior leadership team. We intend to integrate this team into our EbixCash senior leadership, with the goal of having everyone at EbixCash focused on maximizing cross-selling of EbixCash products and services.”\nCDL’s CEO & Managing Director, T.C.Guruprasad said, “We are thrilled to join Ebix and contribute to building a world-leading exchange. We believe that the synergies between EbixCash and CDL are at multiple levels and the CDL Exchange when complemented with EbixCash’s portfolio of finance, insurance & healthcare services, will set the foundations of a very powerful and scalable business opportunity. Also, Ebix’s global reach and international partnerships with large financial institutions open International expansion opportunities for our products and services. We genuinely believe that EbixCash is the logical home for CDL and are excited by the possibilities this offers both for our customers and partners.”\nAbout Ebix, Inc.\nWith 50+ offices across 5 continents, Ebix, Inc., (NASDAQ:EBIX) endeavors to provide On-Demand software and E-commerce services to the insurance, financial and healthcare industries.
