    "text": "PARIS, April 5 (Reuters) - France hopes a “first significant step” in the development of a new European fighter jet will be announced later this month, Defence Minister Florence Parly told La Tribune newspaper on Thursday.\nFrance and Germany first unveiled plans to develop the new warplane in July, two months after President Emmanuel Macron’s election win, burying past industrial rivalries to tighten defence and security.\nThe project accelerates steps to shape the future of the European fighter industry and its three existing programmes - the Eurofighter, France’s Rafale and Sweden’s Gripen.\nParly said that ongoing “active talks” should permit an announcement at the ILA Berlin Air Show from April 25-29.\n“On a political level, discussions between the French and German teams are intense. The industrial groups are working well together and now we have to ensure the two processes come together,” Parly told the newspaper.\nIt was too early to talk about including other EU partners in the project, she said.\nWork with Britain on a future combat drone was also advancing, the minister added.\nFrance and Germany have said the new fighter jet would replace the Rafale and Eurofighter, rival jets that compete fiercely for global sales.\nIt would mark the end of a decades-long split since France withdrew from the Eurofighter project in the 1980s to produce its Rafale warplane with Dassault Aviation.\nThe Eurofighter is made by Airbus, Italy’s Leonardo and Britain’s BAE Systems, While the Gripen is manufactured by Saab.\nReporting by Cyril Altmeyer Writing by Richard Lough Editing by Alison Williams\n ",
