    "text": "3 COMMENTS U.S. companies lately have only good news to share with their investors. That might actually foretell a problem for stocks.\nFirst-quarter earnings season is shaping up to be a particularly strong one. More than half of companies in the S&P 500 have reported results and about 80% of those have topped analyst profit expectations. On average, earnings per share in those companies have grown by about 23% from a year ago, according to FactSet.\nYet that ostensibly bullish backdrop hasn’t done anything to lift stock prices: The S&P 500 is essentially flat so far this year.\nThe nonreaction from stocks can be explained by the reality that markets are forward-looking. Shareholders essentially had been paid in advance for this quarter. Today’s strong results in large part reflect December’s tax-overhaul bill, which helped stocks shoot higher throughout 2017.\nCompanies have driven tax rates lower for years, thanks to tactics such as booking profits overseas. That trend might be reaching its limit. Google-parent Alphabet Inc. reported an effective tax rate of 11%, down from 20% a quarter ago. Pharmaceutical manufacturer AbbVie reported a first-quarter tax rate of just 7.6%, though the company said it anticipates that figure to increase to 13% by 2023. Those savings, plus large sums multinationals repatriated from abroad, have freed up cash for increased dividends and share buybacks.\nThe problem for investors is that those low tax rates take a future source of earnings growth off the table. What is more, there isn’t an obvious marketwide boost to follow in the tax overhaul's wake that investors can clearly envision.\nMeanwhile, some potential market negatives loom. For example, corporations might choose to spend more of the tax overhaul benefits on capital expenditures than investors currently anticipate. And certain political threats, such as potential trade restrictions and tariffs, may intensify.\nThat doesn’t necessarily mean a selloff is in store. The S&P 500 now trades at about 17 times forward earnings forecasts, according to FactSet, down from more than 19 times at January’s record high price. The current valuation isn’t far from the five year average multiple of earnings.\nBut don’t be surprised if investors need to see a few more earnings seasons like the current quarter for another leg higher for the stock market.\nWrite to Charley Grant at charles.grant@wsj.com",
