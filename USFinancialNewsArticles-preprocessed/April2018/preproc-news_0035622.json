    "text": "DALLAS, April 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Capital Southwest Corporation (“Capital Southwest” or the “Company”; (Nasdaq:CSWC), an internally managed Business Development Company focused on providing flexible financing solutions to support the acquisition and growth of middle market businesses, today announced an expansion to its Senior Secured Credit Facility (the “Credit Facility”) from $180 million to $200 million. The $20 million increase in total commitments was the result of the addition of a new lender, bringing the total lender group to nine participants.

We value our relationships with our existing and new lenders and are grateful for their continued support.”\nAbout Capital Southwest\nCapital Southwest Corporation (Nasdaq:CSWC) is a Dallas, Texas-based, internally managed Business Development Company with approximately $299 million in net assets as of December 31, 2017.
