    "text": "(Reuters) - Vistara, a joint venture of Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines, said on Wednesday it had ordered two more A320neo aircraft from Airbus to kick-start its international operations.\nThe Airbus A320neo (New Engine Option) takes off during its first flight event in Colomiers near Toulouse, southwestern France, September 25, 2014. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/Files Vistara Chief Executive Officer Leslie Thng said in January they are looking to start international operations by the second half of 2018.\nThe carrier has received its initial fleet order with the arrival of its seventh Airbus A320neo aircraft on Wednesday, to scale up its frequency in existing operations in the domestic market, it said.\nReporting by Krishna V Kurup in Bengaluru; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu\n ",
