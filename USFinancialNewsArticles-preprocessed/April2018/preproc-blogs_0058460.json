    "text": "AMD shares jumped 11 percent on Wednesday after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected first quarter results.\nEarnings: 11 cents per share, excluding certain items, vs. 9 cents per share as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue: $1.65 billion vs. $1.57 billion as expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters. AMD also provided a forecast that topped estimates. The company said it's expecting $1.72 billion in revenue, give or take $50 million, in the second quarter, compared to analyst expectations for sales of $1.58 billion.\nRevenue in the first quarter jumped 40 percent year over year, AMD said . The biggest gains came from the company's Computing and Graphics Business Segment, which climbed 95 percent to $1.12 billion.\nBy the end of the year, AMD expects that companies will come out with 60 systems based on its Ryzen PC chip architecture by the end of the year, CEO Lisa Su said on a conference call with analysts after the earnings report came out.\nAMD's Enterprise, Embedded and Semi-Custom segment declined 12 percent to $532 million, primarily due to a drop in semi-custom revenue, which includes chips customized for game console makers. The semi-custom decline is connected to a gain in licensing business that happened in the first quarter of last year -- specifically around a gaming console.\nWith its Epyc server chips, AMD has been trying to gain share in a market dominated by Intel. The chipmaker continues to expect to have mid-single-digit server chip unit share by the end of the year, Su said.\n\"I will say, for the first-generation Epyc, we're seeing really nice customer interest, and it's quite broad. And so it is across enterprise as well as the hyperscale customers. And we view this as a multigenerational play, so we're very excited about what Epyc can do over the next couple of quarters,\" Su said.\nshow chapters Bulls bet on AMD, this financial play 2:27 PM ET Mon, 23 April 2018 | 02:22 \"But we also believe that this is the right investment to make with the customer set as we bring out the second generation of Epyc and the third generation of Epyc, obviously, it would go a little bit faster, because the customer set us as a familiar with our system.\"\nAMD will sample the second-generation Epyc chips later this year but will only put it into production next year, Su said. That means Su's unit share estimate for this year solely relies on sales of the first version of the chip.\nMeanwhile, big companies operating large data centers have been testing out an AMD Radeon graphics card for accelerating artificial intelligence workloads, Su said.\nBlockchain represented 10 percent of the company's revenue in the quarter, CFO Devinder Kumar said. In the second quarter, there will be a decline in graphics revenue in connection to blockchain, which will partly offset acceleration in semi-custom revenue, Kumar said.\nIn the first quarter, AMD gained share from Nvidia in the graphics card market and took share from Intel in the desktop chip market, analysts at Susquehanna Financial Group said in a note on April 4.\nAMD shares are down 5.5 percent since the beginning of the year, as of Wednesday's close. During the quarter AMD reckoned with the fallout from the disclosure of the Meltdown and Spectre security vulnerabilities. But Su said at this point the company doesn't see them to have long-term effects on the business.\nshow chapters AMD shares are surging on Wall Street praise 12:36 PM ET Wed, 31 Jan 2018 | 00:39",
