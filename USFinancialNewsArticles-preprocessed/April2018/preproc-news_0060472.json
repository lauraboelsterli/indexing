    "text": "Reliever Pedro Baez balked in the go-ahead run in the seventh inning and Joe Panik followed with a sacrifice fly that capped a four-run rally Friday night, lifting the San Francisco Giants to a 6-4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the opener of a four-game series in San Francisco.\nThe rivals, who are meeting for the third time already this season, will duel in a rare day-night doubleheader Saturday, with one game serving as the make-up for a rainout the last time the Dodgers visited San Francisco.\nAfter Los Angeles had scored four times and knocked out Giants starter Derek Holland in the fourth inning, San Francisco turned the tables against the Dodgers’ bullpen in the seventh.\nBrandon Belt led off with a bunt single and moved to second on a wild pitch off Dodgers left-hander Tony Cingrani (0-1). Belt moved to third on a groundout.\nAfter Brandon Crawford drew a one-out walk, Gorkys Hernandez got the Giants within 4-3 with an RBI single to left field.\nPinch-hitter Kelby Tomlinson followed with a game-tying double, putting runners on second and third and prompting the Dodgers to call upon Baez from the bullpen.\nBut the reliever stumbled on the mound as he prepared to pitch to Panik, producing a balk that sent Hernandez home with the go-ahead run.\nPanik then hit his sacrifice fly that gave the San Francisco bullpen a two-run cushion.\nTony Watson pitched a scoreless eighth for the Giants, stranding the potential tying runs on base, before Hunter Strickland retired the Dodgers 1-2-3 in the ninth, striking out a pair, for his sixth save.\nIn all, five Giants relievers combined to shut out the Dodgers over the final 5 2/3 innings despite allowing four hits and three walks.\nSam Dyson (1-0), who pitched a scoreless seventh, was credited with the win.\nEvan Longoria and Crawford hit solo home runs for the Giants, accounting for the club’s first two runs of the game. The homers were the fifth of the year for Longoria and second for Crawford.\nThey were the only runs allowed by Dodgers starter Hyun-Jin Ryu, who was pulled two outs into the sixth inning with a 4-2 lead. He allowed four hits in his 5 2/3 innings, striking out seven without walking a batter.\nRyu had provided himself with the two-run lead with a two-RBI double off Holland in the fourth.\nYasmani Grandal and Yasiel Puig had run-scoring doubles for Los Angeles earlier in the inning.\nHolland went 3 1/3 innings, allowing four runs and four hits. He walked four and struck out three.\nLongoria, Belt and Hernandez had two hits apiece for the Giants, who have won four of their seven head-to-heads with the Dodgers this season.\nKyle Farmer went 3-for-4 with three singles for the Dodgers, who have lost three in a row after having won seven of eight.\nThe Giants outhit the Dodgers 9-8.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
