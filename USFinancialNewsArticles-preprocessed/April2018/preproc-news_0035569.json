    "text": "Taylor Hall produced a goal and two assists as the New Jersey Devils rallied for a 5-2 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning on Monday in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference quarterfinals in Newark, N.J.\nHall’s big night ensured the Devils will get a chance to even the series in Game 4 at home on Wednesday.\nHall scored his second goal of the series and then made nifty passes to set up goals by Will Butcher and Stefan Noesen in the third period. Hall’s pass to Butcher during a five-on-three tied the game 4:03 into the third, and his feed to Noesen gave the Devils a one-goal lead with 7:05 remaining.\nHall became the first Devil to record a three-point postseason game since Zach Parise on May 21, 2012, against the New York Rangers in the Eastern Conference finals.\nBlake Coleman added insurance with the Devils’ first empty-net goal with 57.3 seconds remaining during a Tampa Bay power play. Ben Lovejoy added a second empty-net tally with 37.8 seconds to play.\nCory Schneider made 34 saves as the Devils opted to use him after he stopped 10 shots in relief of Keith Kinkaid in Game 2. Schneider, who notched his second career playoff victory, made two key saves on Victor Hedman after Hall was called for tripping with 2:46 remaining.\nSchneider also appeared to survive an injury scare with about 10 minutes left in the third when Tampa Bay defenseman Ryan McDonagh collided with him.\nAlex Killorn and Steven Stamkos each registered a power-play goal and an assist for Tampa Bay. Nikita Kucherov recorded the primary assists on both Lightning goals.\nAndrei Vasilevskiy made 36 saves for Tampa Bay, which did not trail for the first 172 minutes, 55 seconds of the series.\nThe Lightning took a 1-0 lead 42 seconds into the second period by getting their fourth power-play goal of the series. Killorn scored his fourth goal of the series by tipping Kucherov’s centering pass from the left corner over Schneider’s stick.\nThe Devils tied the game with 7:36 remaining in the second when Hall lifted a slap shot from the high shot under Vasilevskiy’s legs.\nStamkos gave the Lightning a 2-1 lead 38 seconds into the third with a wrister from the right circle that sailed by Schneider’s left arm.\nButcher tied the game after the Lightning were whistled for too many men on the ice. He exchanged passes with Hall, took the return feed and sent a wrister from near the blue line over Vasilevskiy’s stick while Patrick Maroon provided a screen.\nThe Devils took their first lead of the series when Hall skated through the neutral zone and flew by J.T. Miller before stopping in the left circle. He then whipped a pass to Noesen, who one-timed the shot from the right circle past Vasilevskiy.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
