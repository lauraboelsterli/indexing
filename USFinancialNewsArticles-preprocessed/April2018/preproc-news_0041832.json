    "text": "(Reuters) - Macerich Co said on Thursday Chief Executive Arthur Coppola will retire at year-end, capping a 25-year stint at the helm of the U.S. shopping mall operator.\nThe board of directors has begun a search for a new CEO, Macerich said.\nCoppola will also step down as chairman, and will be succeeded by Macerich board member Steven Hash.\nCoppola’s departure comes at a time when shopping malls are increasingly pressured by a downturn in the brick-and-mortar retail industry as more people shop online.\nMacerich rejected a $16.8 billion bid from rival Simon Property Group Inc in 2015 and has struggled since then. Its stock has declined some 36 percent from an August 2016 high.\nThe company also faces a challenge from activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP, which nominated directors to Macerich’s board earlier this month. Starboard may replace the majority of Macerich’s 10-member board, sources told Reuters.\nReporting by Sanjana Shivdas in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Sai Sachin Ravikumar\n ",
