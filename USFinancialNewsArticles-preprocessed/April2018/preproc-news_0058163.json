    "text": "RED BANK, N.J., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OceanFirst Financial Corp. (NASDAQ:OCFC) , (the “Company”), the holding company for OceanFirst Bank N.A. (the “Bank”), today announced that net income was $5.4 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.12 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $12.0 million and $0.36 for the corresponding prior year period.\nThe results of operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 include merger related expenses and branch consolidation expenses which decreased net income, net of tax benefit by $14.6 million. Excluding these items, core earnings for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were $20.1 million, or $0.45 per diluted share. (Please refer to the Non-GAAP Reconciliation table at the end of this document for details on the earnings impact of merger related expenses and branch consolidation expenses).\nHighlights for the quarter are described below:\nOn January 31, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Sun Bancorp Inc. (“Sun”), the holding company of Sun National Bank, which added $2.0 billion to assets, $1.5 billion to loans, and $1.6 billion to deposits. The Company anticipates full integration of Sun’s operations and systems in June 2018. The Company’s net interest margin increased to 3.70%, as compared to 3.42% in the prior linked quarter, and 3.56% in the comparable prior year period. The cost of deposits increased only one basis point from the prior linked quarter, to 0.33% and the loan to deposit ratio at March 31, 2018 was 91.7%. Asset quality improved as non-performing loans decreased $2.6 million, to $18.3 million, from the prior linked quarter and non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans receivable decreased to 0.34%, from 0.52%.\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Christopher D. Maher said, “With Sun closing on January 31, 2018, we are pleased to include the stockholders, employees, and customers in the OceanFirst family. Sun branches and customers will be fully integrated into OceanFirst and the consolidation of overlapping branches will occur this June.” Mr. Maher added, “Throughout 2018, we will continue to focus on growth initiatives and improvements in operating efficiency.”\nSubstantial cost savings will be realized during the second half of 2018, due to Sun’s planned systems integration and the consolidation of 17 branches, primarily as a result of the merger. These initiatives will further allow the Company to continue to invest in commercial banking and electronic delivery channels while meeting efficiency targets established in connection with the recent acquisitions.\nThe Company also announced that the Company’s Board of Directors declared its eighty-fifth consecutive quarterly cash dividend on common stock. The dividend, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, of $0.15 per share will be paid on May 18, 2018 to stockholders of record on May 7, 2018.\nResults of Operations\nOn January 31, 2018, the Company completed its acquisition of Sun and its results of operations from February 1, 2018 to March 31, 2018 are included in the consolidated results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, but are not included in the results of operations for the corresponding prior year periods.\nNet income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $5.4 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, as compared to $12.0 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the corresponding prior year period. Net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, included merger related and branch consolidation expenses which decreased net income, net of tax benefit, by $14.6 million. Net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 included merger related and branch consolidation expenses, and an accelerated stock award expense from a director retirement, of $1.1 million, net of tax benefit. Excluding these items, net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased over the same prior year period, primarily due to the acquisition of Sun and the successful integration during 2017 of Ocean Shore Holding Co. (“Ocean Shore”) which was acquired on November 30, 2016.\nNet interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, increased to $55.7 million, as compared to $41.5 million for the same prior year period, reflecting an increase in interest-earning assets and a higher net interest margin. Average interest-earning assets increased by $1.378 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same prior year period. The average for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was favorably impacted by $1.174 billion of interest-earning assets acquired from Sun. Average loans receivable, net, increased by $1.139 billion for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same prior year period. The increase attributable to the acquisition of Sun was $989.5 million. The net interest margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased to 3.70%, from 3.56%, for the same prior year period. The net interest margin benefited from the accretion of purchase accounting adjustments on the Sun acquisition; and to a lesser extent, the higher-yielding interest-earning assets acquired from Sun and the impact of Federal Reserve rate increases. The total cost of deposits (including non-interest bearing deposits) was 0.33% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to 0.27% in the same prior year period.\nNet interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, increased $13.2 million, as compared to the prior linked quarter, as average interest-earning assets increased by $1.178 billion, of which $1.174 billion is related to the Sun acquisition. The net interest margin increased to 3.70% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, from 3.42% for the prior linked quarter. The increase in net interest margin was primarily due to a 15 basis point improvement in earning asset yield exclusive of Sun and related purchase accounting accretion, and 15 basis points of purchase accounting accretion relating to Sun. The total cost of deposits (including non-interest bearing deposits) was 0.33% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to 0.32% for quarter ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the provision for loan losses was $1.4 million, as compared to $700,000 for the corresponding prior year period, and unchanged when compared to the prior linked quarter. Net loan charge-offs were $275,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to net loan recoveries of $268,000 in the corresponding prior year period, and net loan charge-offs of $2.3 million in the prior linked quarter. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, net charge-offs included $880,000 of specific reserves established in prior periods on non-performing loans and $1.1 million relating to the sale of under-performing loans; there were no sales of under-performing loans in the first quarter of 2018 that resulted in charge-offs. Non-performing loans totaled $18.3 million at March 31, 2018, as compared to $20.9 million at December 31, 2017, and $21.7 million at March 31, 2017. The decrease in non-performing loans from the prior linked quarter was primarily due to the sale of one commercial loan relationship.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, other income increased to $8.9 million as compared to $6.0 million for the corresponding prior year period. The increase was partly due to the impact of the Sun acquisition, which added $1.4 million to other income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to the same prior year period. Excluding the Sun acquisition, the remaining increase in other income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was primarily due to the gain on sale of loans of $613,000, mostly related to the sale of one non-performing commercial loan relationship, rental income of $460,000 received for January and February 2018 on the Company’s recently acquired corporate headquarters (the building was occupied by the former owner through February 2018), and the decrease in the net loss from other real estate operations of $321,000, as compared to the same prior year period.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, other income increased by $2.2 million, as compared to the prior linked quarter. The increase is primarily due to the impact of the Sun acquisition and the gain on sale of loans.\nOperating expenses increased to $56.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $31.0 million in the same prior year period. Operating expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, included $18.3 million of merger related and branch consolidation expenses, as compared to $1.5 million in the same prior year period. Excluding the impact of merger and branch consolidation expenses, the increase in operating expenses over the prior year was primarily due to the Sun acquisition, which added $8.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. Excluding the Sun acquisition, the remaining increase in operating expenses over the prior year period was primarily due to increases in compensation and employee benefits expense as a result of higher incentive plan expense, and occupancy expense, partly due to costs of snow removal.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, operating expenses, excluding merger and branch consolidation expenses, increased $12.1 million, as compared to the prior linked quarter. The increase was primarily related to the additional expense from the operations of Sun, as well as increases in compensation and employee benefits expense, primarily higher incentive plan expense and higher salary, data processing expense and occupancy expense, partly due to costs of snow removal.\nThe provision for income taxes was $1.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $3.8 million for the same prior year period. The effective tax rate was 15.6% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, as compared to 24.0% for the same prior year period. The lower effective tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 resulted from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform”) enacted during the fourth quarter of 2017 and the larger impact of tax-exempt income on the smaller income before taxes.\nFinancial Condition\nTotal assets increased by $2.079 billion, to $7.495 billion at March 31, 2018, from $5.416 billion at December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Sun, which added $2.045 billion to total assets. Loans receivable, net, increased by $1.448 billion, to $5.414 billion at March 31, 2018 from $3.966 billion at December 31, 2017, due to acquired loans of $1.518 billion from the acquisition of Sun. As part of the acquisition of Sun, the Company’s goodwill balance increased to $337.5 million at March 31, 2018, from $150.5 million, and the core deposit intangible increased to $20.0 million, from $8.9 million.\nDeposits increased by $1.565 billion, to $5.907 billion at March 31, 2018, from $4.343 billion at December 31, 2017, due to acquired deposits of $1.616 billion. The loan-to-deposit ratio at March 31, 2018 was 91.7%, as compared to 91.3% at December 31, 2017.\nStockholders’ equity increased to $1.007 billion at March 31, 2018, as compared to $601.9 million at December 31, 2017. The acquisition of Sun added $402.6 million to stockholders’ equity. At March 31, 2018, there were 1.8 million shares available for repurchase under the Company’s stock repurchase programs. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company did not repurchase any shares under these repurchase programs. Tangible stockholders’ equity per common share decreased to $13.51 at March 31, 2018, as compared to $13.58 at December 31, 2017.\nAsset Quality\nThe Company’s non-performing loans decreased to $18.3 million at March 31, 2018, as compared to $20.9 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the sale of one commercial loan relationship. Non-performing loans do not include $14.4 million of purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans acquired in the Sun, Ocean Shore, Cape Bancorp, Inc. (“Cape”), and Colonial American Bank (“Colonial American”) acquisitions (“Acquisition Transactions”). The Company’s other real estate owned totaled $8.3 million at March 31, 2018, as compared to $8.2 million at December 31, 2017.\nThe Company’s delinquent loans 30 - 89 days were $35.4 million at March 31, 2018, as compared to $20.8 million at December 31, 2017. The increase was related to one $15.0 million commercial relationship which was in the process of renewal at March 31, 2018. Subsequent to quarter-end, the renewal process was completed and the loan returned to current status.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company’s allowance for loan losses was 0.31% of total loans, a decrease from 0.40% at December 31, 2017. These ratios exclude existing fair value credit marks of $40.7 million at March 31, 2018 on loans acquired from the Acquisition Transactions, and $17.5 million at December 31, 2017 on loans acquired from Ocean Shore, Cape and Colonial American. These loans were acquired at fair value with no related allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total non-performing loans was 92.14% at March 31, 2018 as compared to 75.35% at December 31, 2017.\nExplanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nReported amounts are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). The Company’s management believes that the supplemental non-GAAP information, which consists of reported net income excluding merger related expenses, branch consolidation expenses, additional income tax expense related to Tax Reform enacted in the fourth quarter of 2017, and accelerated stock award expense relating to a director retirement, which can vary from period to period, provides a better comparison of period to period operating performance. Additionally, the Company believes this information is utilized by regulators and market analysts to evaluate a company’s financial condition and therefore, such information is useful to investors. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures which may be presented by other companies. Please refer to Non-GAAP Reconciliation table at the end of this document for details on the earnings impact of these items.\nConference Call\nAs previously announced, the Company will host an earnings conference call on Friday, April 27, 2018 at 11 a.m. Eastern time.
