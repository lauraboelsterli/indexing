Hamill was one of 10 women recognized overall and one of six in her category.\nThe Top Women in Restaurant Technology Awards seek to honor outstanding women from both restaurants and technology suppliers for reimagining restaurant processes and operations while demonstrating excellence in leadership, inventiveness and skill.\n“I’m grateful to receive this award and to be recognized by an industry I’ve served for so many years. I congratulate my fellow honorees for their ongoing contributions to their companies and our industry,” said Hamill. “I’m proud to work for an employer that prioritizes innovation and gives all its team members the opportunity to work on challenging, fulfilling projects designed to deliver better hospitality to more people.”\n“These impressive professionals are recognized for outstanding achievement in helping to reimagine restaurant processes and operations. The emerging cracks in the glass ceiling are in large part due to the efforts and achievements of women like this,” said Editor Dorothy Creamer.\nDuring her 20-plus year career in the industry, Hamill served as a VP of Human Resources and VP of HR & Information Technology for brands like Fuddruckers and Max & Erma’s.\n“Mary’s experience and history in the restaurant industry make her an invaluable member of our executive leadership team, our company and our industry,” said Mike Arenth, CEO at HotSchedules. “Her team is on the tip of the spear of the issues facing operations, finance and IT professionals. Last year alone, our solutions team consulted with and supported thousands of restaurants and some of the industry’s most well-known brands.”\nHamill and her peers in the “Innovation” category were recognized for being forward-thinkers who are transforming the foodservice tech space by deploying emerging solutions that reimagine how things are done, while paving the way for future technologies.\nA complete list of the 2018 Top Women in Restaurant Technology Awards winners can be found here: https://hospitalitytech.com/2018-top-women-restaurant-technology\nAbout HotSchedules\nHotSchedules works with over 33,000 customers – from large international chains to some of the hottest new concepts.
