    "text": "* Both NSE, BSE indexes up 0.5 pct\n* Both indexes up for 7th straight session\n* Infosys hits 3-wk high ahead of results\nBy Vishal Sridhar\nApril 13 (Reuters) - Indian shares rose for a seventh straight session on Friday, in what could be their longest winning streak since November 2017, on the back of gains in index heavyweights such as Reliance Industries Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd.\nSentiment was also upbeat after retail inflation eased to a five-month low in March, but remained above the central bank’s medium-term target, supporting views that monetary policy is likely to remain unchanged at the next review in early June.\n“Ever since RBI (Reserve Bank of India) cuts its inflation trajectory, the equities have done well. And if this trend of falling inflation and reduction in bond yields continue, good signs await the equity markets,” said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services.\nInvestors now await January-March corporate results for future direction. Software services exporter Infosys Ltd will kick-start the March-quarter results season later in the day.\n“Excluding banks, expectations for March-quarter results are positive,” Nair added.\nThe broader NSE index was up 0.48 percent at 10,508.75 as of 0541 GMT, while the benchmark BSE index was 0.5 percent higher at 34,272.29.\nThe BSE index has gained 1.9 percent so far this week, while NSE index has added 1.7 percent.\nAmong gainers, Reliance Industries Ltd rose nearly 1 percent on Friday and hit its highest since March 5. Infosys extended gains into a fourth session and hit a three-week high, while Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd jumped nearly 4 percent and was the top percentage gainer on both indexes.\nThe Nifty Bank index climbed for a second straight session, with both ICICI Bank Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd trading more than 1 percent higher.\nMetal stocks climbed with the Nifty metal index up for a third session in four. Hindalco Industries Ltd and Vedanta Ltd rose 2 percent and 1.5 percent, respectively. (Reporting by Vishal Sridhar in Bengaluru; Editing by Subhranshu Sahu)\n ",
