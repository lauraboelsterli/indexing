First-quarter net income attributable to Visteon was $65 million or $2.11 per diluted share for 2018, compared with $63 million or $1.91 per diluted share for 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined below, was $104 million for the first quarter, compared with $101 million in the same period last year. Adjusted net income, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined below, was $64 million for the first quarter or $2.08 per diluted share, compared with $57 million or $1.73 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017.\nDuring the first quarter, global vehicle manufacturers awarded Visteon new business of $1.6 billion in lifetime revenue. The ongoing backlog, defined as cumulative remaining life-of-program booked sales, was $20.1 billion as of March 31, 2018, up from $19.4 billion at the end of 2017.\n\"Our strong first-quarter results provided a solid start to 2018, as we achieved year-over-year improvements in sales, adjusted EBITDA, new business wins and free cash flow,\" said Visteon President and CEO Sachin Lawande. \"Despite softness in global vehicle production volumes in the quarter, we recorded our 13th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA margin.\"\nLawande added: \"We were very pleased with multiple SmartCore™ wins – including an award from Geely Auto for its next-generation new energy vehicle platform – as well as an Automotive News PACE Award for technology innovation. With the market transitioning toward electronic control unit consolidation, Visteon is in a very good position to continue to capitalize on this trend as the leader in cockpit domain controller solutions.”\nFirst Quarter in Review\nSales totaled $814 million and $810 million during the first quarter of 2018 and 2017, respectively, for an increase of $4 million. Sales increased in Asia, driven by new product launches, offset by a decrease in sales in the Americas, primarily reflecting lower production volumes. On a regional basis, Asia accounted for 39 percent of sales, Europe 33 percent, and the Americas 28 percent.\nGross margin for the first quarter of 2018 was $129 million, consistent with $129 million a year earlier. Adjusted EBITDA was $104 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $101 million for the same quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 12.8 percent for the first quarter of 2018, 30 basis points higher than the prior year.\nGross margin and adjusted EBITDA were impacted by favorable currency and a positive business equation, partially offset by lower production volumes and product mix. Business equation is defined as cost performance net of customer pricing.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, net income was $65 million or $2.11 per diluted share, compared with net income of $63 million or $1.91 per diluted share for the same period in 2017. First-quarter 2018 net income included a $17 million benefit in connection with a legal settlement. This benefit was partially offset by an increase in restructuring charges of $4 million and income taxes of $5 million. Additionally, 2017 discontinued operations, net of tax, included a gain of $7 million associated with the repurchase of the India operations. Adjusted net income, which excludes restructuring charges and discontinued operations, was $64 million or $2.08 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $57 million or $1.73 per diluted share for the same period in 2017.\nCash and Debt Balances\nAs of March 31, 2018, Visteon had total cash of $526 million. Total debt as of March 31, 2018, was $382 million.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, cash from operations was $81 million, and capital expenditures were $44 million. Total Visteon adjusted free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined below, for the first quarter of 2018 was $48 million, compared with a use of $31 million during the first quarter of 2017, driven by improved receivables performance.\nShare Repurchases\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the company executed agreements to purchase $200 million of shares.\nThe company paid $50 million to repurchase 410,325 shares at an average price of $121.85 through various programs with third-party financial institutions.\nAdditionally, on March 6, 2018, Visteon entered into an Accelerated Share Buyback (ASB) program with a third-party financial institution to purchase shares of its common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $150 million. At inception of the program, Visteon received an initial delivery of 988,386 shares, which represents 80 percent of the shares to be delivered, using a reference price of $121.41. The ASB is expected to conclude no later than the third quarter of 2018. Visteon is authorized to purchase an additional $500 million through Dec. 31, 2020, under the Board of Directors' Jan. 15, 2018, resolution.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the company had 29.8 million diluted shares of common stock outstanding.\nAbout Visteon\nVisteon is a global technology company that designs, engineers and manufactures innovative cockpit electronics products and connected car solutions for most of the world’s major vehicle manufacturers.

Receipts and Cash Payments.”\nVISTEON CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(Unaudited, Dollars in Millions)\nAdjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company's performance that management believes is useful to investors because the excluded items may vary significantly in timing or amounts and/or may obscure trends useful in evaluating and comparing the Company's operating activities across reporting periods. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to the Company adjusted to eliminate the impact of depreciation and amortization, restructuring expense, net interest expense, equity in net income of non-consolidated affiliates, loss on divestiture, gain on non-consolidated affiliate transactions, provision for income taxes, discontinued operations, net income attributable to non-controlling interests, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and other gains and losses not reflective of the Company's ongoing operations. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThree Months Ended Estimated March 31 Full Year Visteon 2018 2017 2018 Adjusted EBITDA $ 104 $ 101 $370 - $380 Depreciation and amortization (22 ) (19 ) (90) Restructuring expense (5 ) (1 ) (10) Interest expense, net (2 ) (5 ) (10) Equity in net income of non-consolidated affiliates 3 2 10 Provision for income taxes (21 ) (16 ) (55) Income from discontinued operations, net of tax 2 8 2 Net income attributable to non-controlling interests (4 ) (4 ) (15) Non-cash, stock-based compensation 6 (2 ) (8) Other 4 (1 ) 4 Net income attributable to Visteon $ 65 $ 63 $198 - $208 Adjusted EBITDA is not a recognized term under U.S. GAAP and does not purport to be a substitute for net income as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and is not intended to be a measure of cash flow available for management's discretionary use, as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. In addition, the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA (i) as a factor in incentive compensation decisions, (ii) to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company's business strategies, and (iii) because the Company's credit agreements use similar measures for compliance with certain covenants.\nFree Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow : Free cash flow and Adjusted free cash flow are presented as supplemental measures of the Company's liquidity that management believes are useful to investors in analyzing the Company's ability to service and repay its debt. The Company defines Free cash flow as cash flow provided from operating activities less capital expenditures. The Company defines Adjusted free cash flow as cash flow provided from operating activities less capital expenditures, as further adjusted for restructuring and transformation-related payments. Free cash flow and Adjusted free cash flow include amounts associated with discontinued operations. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of Free cash flow and Adjusted free cash flow may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThree Months Ended March 31 Estimated Total Visteon 2018 2017 Full Year 2018 Cash provided from (used by) operating activities total Visteon $ 81 $ (11 ) $245 - $265 Capital expenditures, including intangibles (44 ) (32 ) (110 - 105) Free cash flow $ 37 $ (43 ) $135 - $160 Restructuring/transformation-related payments 11 12 25 - 20 Adjusted free cash flow $ 48 $ (31 ) $160 - $180 Free cash flow and Adjusted free cash flow are not recognized terms under U.S. GAAP and do not purport to be a substitute for cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Free cash flow and Adjusted free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools as they do not reflect cash used to service debt and do not reflect funds available for investment or other discretionary uses. In addition, the Company uses Free cash flow and Adjusted free cash flow (i) as factors in incentive compensation decisions and (ii) for planning and forecasting future periods.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Earnings Per Share : Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share are presented as supplemental measures that management believes are useful to investors in analyzing the Company's profitability, providing comparability between periods by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of recurring business operating results. The Company believes management and investors benefit from referring to these supplemental measures in assessing company performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. The Company defines Adjusted net income as net income attributable to Visteon adjusted to eliminate the impact of restructuring expense, loss on divestiture, gain on non-consolidated affiliate transactions, discontinued operations and related tax effects and other gains and losses not reflective of the Company's ongoing operations. The Company defines Adjusted earnings per share as Adjusted net income divided by diluted shares. Because not all companies use identical calculations, this presentation of Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThree Months Ended March 31 Net income attributable to Visteon: 2018 2017 Electronics $ 63 $ 55 Discontinued operations 2 8 Net income attributable to Visteon $ 65 $ 63\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 Electronics Discontinued\nOperations Total\nVisteon Diluted earnings per share: Net income attributable to Visteon $ 63 $ 2 $ 65 Average shares outstanding, diluted (in millions) 30.8 30.8 30.8 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.05 $ 0.06 $ 2.11 Adjusted earnings per share: Net income attributable to Visteon $ 63 $ 2 $ 65 Restructuring expense 5 — 5 Other (4 ) — (4 ) Income from discontinued operations, net of tax — (2 ) (2 ) Adjusted net income $ 64 $ — $ 64 Average shares outstanding, diluted (in millions) 30.8 30.8 30.8 Adjusted earnings per share $ 2.08 $ — $ 2.08 Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Electronics Discontinued\nOperations Total\nVisteon Diluted earnings per share: Net income attributable to Visteon $ 55 $ 8 $ 63 Average shares outstanding, diluted (in millions) 33.0 33.0 33.0 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.67 $ 0.24 $ 1.91 Adjusted earnings per share: Net income attributable to Visteon $ 55 $ 8 $ 63 Restructuring expense 1 — 1 Other 1 — 1 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax — (8 ) (8 ) Adjusted net income $ 57 $ — $ 57 Average shares outstanding, diluted (in millions) 33.0 33.0 33.0 Adjusted earnings per share $ 1.73 $ — $ 1.73 Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share are not recognized terms under U.S. GAAP and do not purport to be a substitute for profitability. Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share have limitations as analytical tools as they do not consider certain restructuring and transaction-related payments and/or expenses. In addition, the Company uses Adjusted net income and Adjusted earnings per share for planning and forecasting future periods.\nContacts:\nMedia:\nJim Fisher\n734-710-5557\n734-417-6184 – mobile\njfishe89@visteon.com\nInvestors:\nBill Robertson\n734-710-8349\nwilliam.robertson@visteon.com\nSource:Visteon Corporation",
