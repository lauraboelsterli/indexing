    "text": "SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s banking and insurance regulator has issued an urgent notice to check risks of provincial-level debt clearers targeting fake deals to help banks massage their books, three sources told Reuters on Monday.\nChina’s provincial governments have rushed to set up asset management companies (AMCs) in recent months after Beijing relaxed rules to allow each province to set up two local AMCs to handle rising bad debt nationwide.\nBut the bad debt market is still dominated by the “Big Four” AMCs - Huarong, Cinda, Great Wall and Orient, set up in 1999 to clear up bad loans at state-owned banks.\nThe regulator will conduct “special investigations” into business activities of local AMCs to find out the cause of risks and measures to deal with risk, according to the sources.\nLocal AMCs were required to report their operations of 2017 and the first quarter of this year, including their disposal of non-performing assets and debt restructuring, the sources said.\nThe regulator will focus on possible falsified bad-loan dealings between banks and AMCs to “whitewash” their financial statements, they said.\nOne source said the regulator was drafting guidelines on AMCs to regulate their businesses and close possible loopholes.\nThe banking and insurance regulator has yet to respond to Reuters’ request for comment.\nReporting by Li Zheng and Kevin Yao; editing by Darren Schuettler and Nick Macfie\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
