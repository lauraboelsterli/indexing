    "text": " 18 p.m. ET Share \nIslamic State takes credit for Kabul blast ahead of elections Reuters A woman mourns at a hospital Sunday after the suicide attack in Kabul, Afghanistan. \nBy Craig Nelson \nKABUL — A suspected Islamic State suicide bomber struck a voter-registration center in the Afghan capital on Sunday, killing at least 52 people in an attack aimed at inciting sectarian strife and undermining long-delayed parliamentary elections. \nThe attacker detonated his explosive belt among a crowd of Afghans who had lined up outside the center, a government-rented building, in the mainly Shiite Muslim district of Dashte Barchi in western Kabul to obtain the identification cards they needed to cast their ballots in the elections, scheduled for Oct. 20. \nIslamic State said it was behind the bombing and identified the bomber as a Pakistani man, assertions that couldn’t be independently verified. A statement by the Sunni extremist group’s Amaq news agency said the man had targeted an election gathering of Shiites, whom it referred to pejoratively as “polytheists.” \nSunday’s attack was at least the fourth such assault on a voter-registration site since the enrollment drive for the elections began eight days ago. It underscores the daunting challenge the Afghan government faces in staging a credible, fraud-free vote, which U.S. and other Western governments view as a crucial chance for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani to show the Afghan public that a Western-leaning government and democratic practices can make a difference their lives.",
