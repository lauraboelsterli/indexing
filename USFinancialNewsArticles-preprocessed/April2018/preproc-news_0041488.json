    "text": "BAKU (Reuters) - The Azeri parliament appointed Novruz Mamedov as the country’s new prime minister on Saturday.\nMamedov has been a foreign policy assistant to Azerbaijan’s President, Ilham Aliyev, since last year. He had previously worked as deputy head of presidential administration.\nAliyev won a fourth term as president of Azerbaijan last week in an election boycotted by major opposition parties and described by election monitors as undemocratic.\nThe former Soviet republic’s huge energy reserves and strategic location on the Caspian Sea make it an important alternative for Europe to Russian oil and gas.\nReporting by Nailia Bagirova; writing by Maria Kiselyova; editing by Alexander Smith, William Maclean\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
