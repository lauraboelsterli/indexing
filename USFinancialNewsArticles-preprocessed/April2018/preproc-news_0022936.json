    "text": "4 COMMENTS Good morning. The trial of the government’s case against AT&T’s proposed acquisition of Time Warner resumed this week. Deciding the fate of the merger is U.S. District Judge Richard Leon. WSJ takes a look at the bowtie-wearing, pencil-sharpening 16-year veteran of the Washington, D.C. court .\nLet’s Take It to the Stage Plenty of news from Facebook again Monday, and there’s not going to be any letup Tuesday as Mark Zuckerberg heads into his first Senate hearing. Lawmakers aren’t expected to give him an easy ride. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a member of the Senate panel that will grill the CEO on Tuesday, told WSJ, “He has to have a better answer than just, ‘I made a mistake.’ He didn’t just spill milk on the breakfast table. There is a more fundamental issue related to Facebook’s business model —they sell your information without your consent.” Ah, this is a little awkward—here’s an excerpt from Mr. Zuckerberg’s prepared testimony : “It was my mistake, and I’m sorry. I started Facebook, I run it, and I’m responsible for what happens here.”\nElsewhere Monday:\nFacebook announced it’s starting a research initiative to look into how social media can be manipulated to affect democracy and elections. Mr. Zuckerberg sent a letter to six nongovernmental organizations in Myanmar, apologizing for not detecting and preventing the spread of abusive content in the country sooner. The NGOs say Facebook’s handling of hate speech in Myanmar has been “ grossly insufficient .” Facebook started to inform users if their data may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica . Facebook has been closely monitoring whether its data scandal is having an impact on employee morale. But, for the most part, so far so good , WSJ reports. Interviews with a number of current and former staffers suggest employees are rallying around the company. A CNN investigation found a “Black Lives Matter” Facebook page with almost 700,000 followers was a “ scam with ties to a middle-aged white man in Australia ” and tied to online fundraising campaigns that generated tens of thousands of dollars. The page has since been suspended, as has a user account that was an administrator for the page.\nAll Under One Roof Raving P&G marketing chief Marc Pritchard isn’t finished shaking up the ad industry as we know it. The packaged goods giant’s fabric-care business in North America is creating a stand-alone agency comprised of talent from Publicis Groupe’s Saatchi & Saatchi, WPP’s Grey and Omnicom’s Marina Maher Communications and Hearts & Science, CMO Today’s Alex Bruell reports. Employees will work together under one roof, under the leadership of Saatchi & Saatchi New York CEO Andrea Diquez, who also will continue in her Saatchi post. By hand-selecting fewer staffers, P&G hopes to increase speed, integration and efficiency. Some agencies find it difficult enough to work with other shops within their own network, let alone with other holding companies. This will be a fascinating one to revisit in a year’s time to see how they’re all getting on and find out how the P&Ls were divvied up. Some of you might remember Commonwealth, the joint venture created for Chevrolet by Omnicom’s Goodby, Silverstein & Partners and IPG’s McCann Worldgroup in 2012. GS&P exited the partnership just a year later .\nAnd Just Like the Movies We Play Out Our Last Scene Movie ticket sales fell to their lowest ebb last year since 1995. It’s a trend that has kick-started theaters nationwide into making their offerings more upmarket in a bid to lure consumers away from their couches and their Netflix subscriptions, WSJ reports. Tired seats are being replaced with luxury recliners, high-end drinks and dining options have been added, and theaters are introducing sophisticated visual and sound that beat the living room experience. The move harks back to the 1990s when U.S. theater chains quickly built sprawling multiplexes in response to increased competition from VHS rental stores like Blockbuster. Cinema advertising has maintained a consistent 0.6% share of the global ad market over the past couple of years, according to estimates from Dentsu Aegis Network. In the U.S., cinema ad spend reached $1.27 billion in 2017 and is forecast to grow 5% this year.\nAlterNet Ending CMO Today’s Ben Mullin reports : The effects of Facebook’s shifting news feed algorithm continue to ripple across the digital publishing industry. This time, it’s driving consolidation among left-leaning news sites. Progressive website AlterNet announced Monday that it’s being acquired by the owners of Raw Story, a progressive news organization founded by journalist John Byrne in 2004 that describes itself as focusing on news that’s downplayed by mainstream media outlets. AlterNet, with 2 million monthly visitors, has been relatively insulated from industrywide declines in Facebook referral traffic, whereas Raw Story, which attracts about 6 million unique visitors a month, leaned heavily into distribution on Facebook. Mr. Byrne said the acquisition of AlterNet is an effort to shore up Raw Story’s declining audience. “AlterNet has a lot of direct traffic, and Raw Story has been dependent a lot on Facebook,” Mr. Byrne said. “We felt for us, it was good to have a variety of traffic sources.” The terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.\nBest of the rest Gizmodo Media Group CEO Raju Narisetti (and News Corp alum) is leaving the company. In a memo, Mr. Narisetti said that he is leaving “with [parent company] Univision’s reluctant blessing” and that he doesn’t yet have a new gig lined up. [ The Daily Beast ]\nU.K. publishers are banding together to get clarity about GroupM’s new data protection contract the media-buying group has asked suppliers to sign in preparation for Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation. [ Digiday ]\nFormer Fox News executive Michael Clemente has been named CEO of Newsmax TV. [ The Hill ]\nThe most popular podcasts are drawing in millions of listeners, and their hosts and producers are capitalizing on their success by taking their shows on the road. [ WSJ ]\nCBS Sports said overnight ratings for the Masters for its final-round coverage Sunday were up 14% this year over last. [ Golfweek ]\nCheck out this neat, mildly terrifying graphic showing how much data you might be sharing with companies on an average pizza-and-movie night.
