    "text": "Pedestrians pass in front of a Skechers store in New York. \nCheck out the companies making headlines after the bell : \nSkechers stock plummeted more than 23 percent in the extended session. The footwear company reported earnings and revenues that surpassed Wall Street expectations. Global same-store sales were also up 9.5 percent. Despite the strong earnings, weak second-quarter guidance sent shares falling. \nE*Trade shares fell more than 1 percent after hours despite a favorable earnings announcement. Its earnings per share and revenues both beat estimates. Daily average revenue trades also rose to a new record this quarter. \nShares of Pinnacle Foods jumped more than 7 percent after the bell. Jana Partners reported a 9.1 percent stake in the food supplier. Jana plans to discuss value creation measures with Pinnacle and may pursue a board change. \nAtlassian stock plunged more than 11 percent post-market. The software company reported EPS and revenues that were higher than analyst estimates, but shares fell on weak guidance. ",
