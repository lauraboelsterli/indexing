    "text": "Pedro Alvarez hit a grand slam with one out in the top of the 14th inning as the Baltimore Orioles outlasted the New York Yankees 7-3 on Friday night at Yankee Stadium.\nAlvarez hit his third career grand slam when he lifted a first-pitch slider from Jonathan Holder (0-1) into the right-center field seats. Alvarez’s grand slam occurred after Adam Jones was nearly ejected for arguing a called strike three.\nAccording to the YES Network, it was the latest grand slam ever hit against the Yankees.\nManny Machado recorded his 12th career game with four hits and reached base six times. He homered in the first and third innings off CC Sabathia, who exited with a right hip injury after the fourth.\nChris Davis also homered for the Orioles, who won their second straight despite striking out 16 times, going 1-for-10 with runners in scoring position and stranding 12 runners.\nDidi Gregorius hit the game-tying homer in the eighth off Miguel Castro and nearly scored the winning run on a wild pitch in the 11th. Gregorius slid head first when Mychal Givens threw a wild pitch but was easily tagged out and the call was upheld after the Yankees challenged.\nLong before Alvarez won it, Giancarlo Stanton and Aaron Judge hit bloop RBI singles off Kevin Gausman in the first and third innings.\nStanton was 2-for-6 with two strikeouts while Judge was 1-for-4 with three strikeouts as the Yankees went 2-for-11 with runners in scoring position.\nAfter Gausman allowed two runss on five hits in five-plus innings, the Orioles used five relievers. Pedro Araujo (1-1) pitched two scoreless innings for his first career win and Brad Brach struck out Tyler Austin to end the five-hour, 20-minute marathon.\nSabathia allowed three runs and four hits before exiting and was headed for an MRI. The Yankees also lost infielders Brandon Drury and Tyler Wade to apparent injuries along with catcher Gary Sanchez, who appeared to injure his calf in the 14th.\nMachado made it 1-0 by lifting a 1-0 slider into the first row of the second deck in left field with one out in the first.\nThe Yankees quickly tied it when Stanton blooped a single to right field after Gausman walked Brett Gardner and hit Aaron Judge with a pitch.\nMachado made it 2-1 when he opened the third by lifting a 1-2 fastball into the Baltimore bullpen beyond the left-center field fence. The Yankees responded again with another bloop single, this time by Judge as Gardner raced in from second.\nDavis made it 3-2 by lifting a full-count slider into the right-center field bleachers to start the fourth and the Orioles carried the lead until Gregorius homered.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
