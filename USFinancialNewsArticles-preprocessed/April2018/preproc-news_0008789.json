    "text": "BUCHAREST, April 4 (Reuters) - Romaniaâ€™s central bank kept its benchmark interest rate on hold at 2.25 percent on Wednesday after two consecutive hikes meant to control a sharp jump in inflation.\nNine of ten analysts polled by Reuters last month had expected policymakers to hike interest rates by a quarter point.\nThe bank has raised interest rates twice so far this year by an overall 50 basis points, its first hikes in a decade. The median forecast of a Reuters poll puts them at 3 percent at end-2018.\nGovernor Mugur Isarescu is expected to provide details on the decision from 1200 GMT.
