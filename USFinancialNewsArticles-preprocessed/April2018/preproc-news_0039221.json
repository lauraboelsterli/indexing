    "text": "TUPELO, Miss., BancorpSouth Bank (NYSE: BXS) (the \"Company\") today announced financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights for the first quarter of 2018 included:\nRecord quarterly net income of $53.5 million, or $0.54 per diluted share; represents an increase of 32 percent on a per share basis compared to both the first and fourth quarters of 2017. Completed acquisitions of Central Community Corporation and Ouachita Bancshares Corp. effective January 15, 2018; recorded merger-related expenses of $5.7 million for the first quarter. Earnings benefitted from a positive pre-tax mortgage servicing rights (\"MSR\") valuation adjustment of $5.5 million. Net operating income – excluding MSR – of $53.6 million, or $0.54 per diluted share. Reported total deposit growth of approximately $240 million, or 8 percent on an annualized basis, excluding balances acquired through mergers during the quarter, while organic loan growth for the quarter totaled approximately $50 million, or 2 percent on an annualized basis. Net interest margin increased to 3.67 percent from 3.58 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017. Repurchased 2,073,986 shares of outstanding common stock at a weighted average price of $32.32.\nThe Company reported net income of $53.5 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018 compared with net income of $38.1 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017 and net income of $37.5 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company reported net operating income – excluding MSR – of $53.6 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $36.9 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017 and $36.8 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet operating income – excluding MSR – is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management to assess the core operating performance of the Company. This measure excludes items such as realized securities gains and losses, MSR valuation adjustments, restructuring charges, merger-related expenses, industry-related legal settlements, and other one-time charges.\n\"Our first quarter results reflect record quarterly earnings for our Company, both in terms of net income and earnings per share,\" remarked Dan Rollins, BancorpSouth Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. \"Although the completion of the acquisitions of Central Community Corporation and Ouachita Bancshares Corp. highlighted the quarter, we saw continued improvement in many other core areas of our financial performance. Our net interest margin increased to 3.67 percent for the quarter, primarily as a result of the continued increases in our loan yields as well as the impact of purchase accounting accretion. Consistent with our historical seasonal first quarter trends, we saw meaningful growth in deposits while organic loan growth was nominal. Finally, we were opportunistic in our share repurchase program, repurchasing just over two million shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $32.32.\"\n\"As we look at other areas of our financial results, the reduction of the statutory federal tax rate enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 had a positive impact on our income tax expense and net income, as expected. Conversely, the new accounting revenue recognition standards implemented during the first quarter resulted in our insurance commission revenue being an estimated $3.7 million less than it would have been under the previous accounting rules.\"\nNet Interest Revenue\nNet interest revenue was $138.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 20.5 percent from $114.6 million for the first quarter of 2017 and an increase of 13.8 percent from $121.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The fully taxable equivalent net interest margin was 3.67 percent for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 3.46 percent for the first quarter of 2017 and 3.58 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017. Yields on net loans and leases were 4.60 percent for the first quarter of 2018 compared with 4.20 percent for the first quarter of 2017 and 4.36 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017, while yields on total interest earning assets were 4.05 percent for the first quarter of 2018 compared with 3.70 percent for the first quarter of 2017 and 3.90 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017. The net interest margin, excluding accretable yield, was 3.60 percent for the first quarter of 2018 while yields on net loans and leases, excluding accretable yield, were 4.51 percent. Purchase accounting accretion did not impact the net interest margin or loan yields for the first and fourth quarters of 2017. The average cost of deposits was 0.31 percent for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 0.23 percent for the first quarter of 2017 and 0.27 percent for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAsset, Deposit and Loan Activity\nTotal assets were $17.2 billion at March 31, 2018 compared with $14.9 billion at March 31, 2017. Loans and leases, net of unearned income, were $12.3 billion at March 31, 2018 compared with $10.8 billion at March 31, 2017. Total deposits were $13.9 billion at March 31, 2018 compared with $12.0 billion at March 31, 2017. These balance sheet comparisons include the impact of the acquisitions of Central Community Corporation and Ouachita Bancshares Corp., which closed effective January 15, 2018. Balance sheet totals for these two banks at the time of closing are disclosed in the \"Transactions\" section of this news release.\nProvision for Credit Losses and Allowance for Credit Losses\nEarnings for the first quarter of 2018 reflect a provision for credit losses of $1.0 million, compared to a provision of $1.0 million for the first quarter of 2017 and a provision of $0.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Net recoveries for the first quarter of 2018 were $0.2 million, compared with net recoveries of $0.5 million for the first quarter of 2017 and net charge-offs of $1.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The allowance for credit losses was $119.4 million, or 0.97 percent of net loans and leases, at March 31, 2018, compared with $125.2 million, or 1.16 percent of net loans and leases, at March 31, 2017 and $118.2 million, or 1.07 percent of net loans and leases, at December 31, 2017. The allowance for credit losses coverage metrics were impacted by the acquisitions that closed during the first quarter of 2018.\nTotal non-performing assets were $90.9 million, or 0.74 percent of net loans and leases, at March 31, 2018 compared with $90.0 million, or 0.83 percent of net loans and leases, at March 31, 2017, and $84.5 million, or 0.76 percent of net loans and leases, at December 31, 2017. Other real estate owned was $9.4 million at March 31, 2018 compared with $8.5 million at March 31, 2017 and $6.0 million at December 31, 2017.\nNoninterest Revenue\nNoninterest revenue was $78.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $70.9 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $63.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. These results included a positive MSR valuation adjustment of $5.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with a positive MSR valuation adjustment of $0.9 million for the first quarter of 2017 and a positive MSR valuation adjustment of $2.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Valuation adjustments in the MSR asset are driven primarily by fluctuations in interest rates period over period.\nExcluding the MSR valuation adjustments, mortgage banking revenue was $7.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $8.1 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $4.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Mortgage origination volume for the first quarter of 2018 was $291.9 million, compared with $287.8 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $308.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCredit and debit card fee revenue was $9.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $8.9 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $9.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Deposit service charge revenue was $10.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $9.7 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $10.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Wealth management revenue was $5.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $5.2 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $5.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Other noninterest revenue was $10.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $4.1 million for both the first quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2017. Other noninterest revenue for the first quarter of 2018 benefitted from a legal settlement totaling $3.0 million.\nInsurance commission revenue was $29.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $32.9 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $25.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers\" and 2015-14 \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date\", which were effective January 1, 2018, impacted the accounting for insurance commission revenue. Previously, contingent commissions were recognized as revenue in the period of receipt, which is weighted toward the first quarter for the Company. Under the new accounting guidance, the Company is required to estimate and accrue for contingent commissions throughout the year. Accordingly, insurance commission revenue for the first quarter was an estimated $3.7 million less than it would have otherwise been under the previous accounting rules.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $147.7 million, compared with $127.1 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $125.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Salaries and employee benefits expense was $91.3 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $81.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $78.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Occupancy expense was $10.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $10.3 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $10.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Other noninterest expense was $39.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $29.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $31.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Other noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was adversely impacted by a single forgery and theft loss totaling $2.3 million. Merger expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.7 million, compared with no merger expense for the first quarter of 2017 and $0.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCapital Management\nThe Company's equity capitalization is comprised entirely of common stock. The Company's ratio of shareholders' equity to assets was 11.99 percent at March 31, 2018, compared with 11.45 percent at March 31, 2017 and 11.20 percent at December 31, 2017. The ratio of tangible shareholders' equity to tangible assets was 8.69 percent at March 31, 2018, compared with 9.49 percent at March 31, 2017 and 9.31 percent at December 31, 2017.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased 2,073,986 shares of its outstanding common stock at a weighted average price of $32.32 per share pursuant to its share repurchase program which is intended to comply with Rules 10b-18 and 10b5-1 promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

The Company has included these non-GAAP financial measures in this news release for the applicable periods presented. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures (i) provides important supplemental information that contributes to a proper understanding of the Company's capital position and operating performance, (ii) enables a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the Company's business and (iii) allows investors to evaluate the Company's performance in a manner similar to management, the financial services industry, bank stock analysts and bank regulators. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are presented in the tables below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as substitutes for GAAP financial measures, and the Company strongly encourages investors to review the GAAP financial measures included in this news release and not to place undue reliance upon any single financial measure. In addition, because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this news release with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names.\nReconciliation of Net Operating Income and Net Operating Income-Excluding MSR to Net Income:\nQuarter ended\n3/31/2018\n12/31/2017\n9/30/2017\n6/30/2017\n3/31/2017\nNet income\n$ 53,491\n$ 37,523\n$ 39,528\n$ 37,889\n$ 38,093\nPlus:\nMerger expense, net of tax\n4,298\n427\n-\n-\n-\nChanges due to tax reform\n-\n623\n-\n-\n-\nLess:\nSecurity gains, net of tax\n20\n325\n3\n14\n664\nNet operating income\n$ 57,769\n$ 38,248\n$ 39,525\n$ 37,875\n$ 37,429\nLess:\nMSR market value adjustment, net of tax\n4,153\n1,476\n(28)\n(936)\n579\nNet operating income-excluding MSR\n$ 53,616\n$ 36,772\n$ 39,553\n$ 38,811\n$ 36,850\nReconciliation of Total Operating Expense to Total Noninterest Expense:\nTotal noninterest expense\n$ 147,701\n$ 125,881\n$ 126,903\n$ 127,553\n$ 127,109\nLess:\nMerger expense\n5,727\n688\n-\n-\n-\nTotal operating expense\n$ 141,974\n$ 125,193\n$ 126,903\n$ 127,553\n$ 127,109\nBancorpSouth Bank\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures and Other Non-GAAP Ratio Definitions\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nReconciliation of Tangible Assets and Tangible Shareholders' Equity to\nTotal Assets and Total Shareholders' Equity:\nQuarter ended\n3/31/2018\n12/31/2017\n9/30/2017\n6/30/2017\n3/31/2017\nTangible assets\nTotal assets\n$ 17,185,772\n$ 15,298,518\n$ 14,760,394\n$ 14,843,130\n$ 14,866,054\nLess:\nGoodwill\n580,900\n300,798\n300,798\n300,798\n300,798\nOther identifiable intangible assets\n40,590\n17,882\n18,860\n19,854\n20,865\nTotal tangible assets\n$ 16,564,282\n$ 14,979,838\n$ 14,440,736\n$ 14,522,478\n$ 14,544,391\nTangible shareholders' equity\nTotal shareholders' equity\n$ 2,060,487\n$ 1,713,485\n$ 1,700,502\n$ 1,691,832\n$ 1,702,389\nLess:\nGoodwill\n580,900\n300,798\n300,798\n300,798\n300,798\nOther identifiable intangible assets\n40,590\n17,882\n18,860\n19,854\n20,865\nTotal tangible shareholders' equity\n$ 1,438,997\n$ 1,394,805\n$ 1,380,844\n$ 1,371,180\n$ 1,380,726\nTotal average assets\n$ 16,918,568\n$ 14,809,497\n$ 14,710,245\n$ 14,741,811\n$ 14,832,260\nTotal shares of common stock outstanding\n99,636,779\n90,312,378\n90,329,896\n91,022,729\n92,344,409\nAverage shares outstanding-diluted\n98,942,268\n90,546,824\n91,099,770\n91,530,552\n93,829,400\nTangible shareholders' equity to tangible assets (1)\n8.69%\n9.31%\n9.56%\n9.44%\n9.49%\nReturn on tangible equity (2)\n15.08%\n10.67%\n11.36%\n11.08%\n11.19%\nOperating return on tangible equity-excluding MSR (3)\n15.11%\n10.46%\n11.36%\n11.35%\n10.82%\nOperating return on average assets-excluding MSR (4)\n1.29%\n0.99%\n1.07%\n1.06%\n1.01%\nOperating return on average shareholders' equity-excluding MSR (5)\n10.80%\n8.58%\n9.25%\n9.27%\n8.63%\nTangible book value per share (6)\n$ 14.44\n$ 15.44\n$ 15.29\n$ 15.06\n$ 14.95\nOperating earnings per share (7)\n$ 0.58\n$ 0.42\n$ 0.43\n$ 0.41\n$ 0.40\nOperating earnings per share-excluding MSR (8)\n$ 0.54\n$ 0.41\n$ 0.43\n$ 0.42\n$ 0.39\n(1)\nTangible shareholders' equity to tangible assets is defined by the Company as total shareholders' equity less goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets, divided by the difference of total assets less goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.\n(2)\nReturn on tangible equity is defined by the Company as annualized net income divided by tangible shareholders' equity.\n(3)\nOperating return on tangible equity-excluding MSR is defined by the Company as annualized net operating income-excluding MSR divided by tangible shareholders' equity.\n(4)\nOperating return on average assets-excluding MSR is defined by the Company as annualized net operating income-excluding MSR divided by total average assets.\n(5)\nOperating return on average shareholders' equity-excluding MSR is defined by the Company as annualized net operating income-excluding MSR divided by average shareholders' equity.\n(6)\nTangible book value per share is defined by the Company as tangible shareholders' equity divided by total shares of common stock outstanding.\n(7)\nOperating earnings per share is defined by the Company as net operating income divided by average shares outstanding-diluted.\n(8)\nOperating earnings per share-excluding MSR is defined by the Company as net operating income-excluding MSR divided by average shares outstanding-diluted.\nEfficiency Ratio (tax equivalent) and Operating Efficiency Ratio-excluding MSR (tax equivalent) Definitions\nThe efficiency ratio (tax equivalent) and the operating efficiency ratio-excluding MSR (tax equivalent) are supplemental financial measures utilized in management's internal evaluation of the Company's use of resources and are not defined under GAAP.
