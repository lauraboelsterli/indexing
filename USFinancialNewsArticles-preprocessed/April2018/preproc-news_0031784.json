Nearly 70% of our revenues is now derived from data, software & services, boosting our gross margin. Automotive operational revenue in the quarter amounted to €78 million, an increase of 42% compared with the same quarter last year.”\nOutlook 2018\nWe are re-iterating our guidance for the year.\nRevenue ~ €800 million Gross margin close to 70% Adjusted EPS ~ €0.25 OPEX & CAPEX (excl. acquisitions) ~ €700 million For the period between 2016 and 2020, we expect the combined reported revenue of the Automotive, Enterprise and Telematics businesses to grow at a CAGR of around 12.5%, taking into account new IFRS accounting standards and current exchange rates. 2\nFinancial and business review\nRevenue for the first quarter amounted to €192 million, 10% lower compared with the same quarter last year (Q1 '17: €213 million). Automotive, Enterprise and Telematics jointly grew by 4% year on year, which was offset by lower Consumer revenue. Gross margin for the quarter equalled 70% (Q1 '17: 63%). The net result adjusted for movement of deferred revenue, unbilled revenue and deferred cost of sales on a post-tax basis was a gain of €22.6 million, which translates to an adjusted EPS of €0.10 (Q1 '17: -€0.03).\nAutomotive & Enterprise\n(€ in millions, unless stated otherwise) Q1 '18 Q1 '17 y.o.y.\nchange\nAutomotive 49.7 44.7 11% Enterprise 30.1 32.8 -8% Total Automotive & Enterprise revenue 79.8 77.5 3% Change percentages and totals calculated before rounding.\nAutomotive & Enterprise combined revenue in the quarter was €80 million (Q1 '17: €78 million). Automotive generated revenue of €50 million in the quarter, representing an 11% increase year on year. This increase mainly came from the ramp-up of existing contracts.\nEnterprise revenue in Q1 '18 was €30 million compared with €33 million in the same quarter last year. This decline was mainly caused by a weaker US dollar.\nIn the quarter, Automotive business announced that both Hyundai and Kia expanded their connected car services to include TomTom On-Street and Off-Street Parking, TomTom EV Service, and TomTom Fuel Price Service. It will be available on all new Hyundai cars produced for Europe, starting from November 2018. For Kia drivers, it will be available starting with the next generation of Kia Ceed, and gradually applied to the whole model range by 2019.\nAt the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, we announced a collaboration with Elektrobit, focused on demonstrating electronic horizon-based ADAS and autonomous driving functions, including features such as curve-speed warnings, fuel-efficient driving and range determination. The joint project will combine TomTom AutoStream and Elektrobit’s EB robinos Predictor to establish an easy-to-use demonstrator, evaluation and development platform for the automotive market.\n2 Our previous expectation, and based on IAS 18 accounting standards, was a CAGR of 15% between 2016 and 2020. 2016 revenue has not materially changed under new IFRS accounting standards.\nWe expanded several of our connected car services during the quarter. TomTom EV Service was launched in North America. The live service designed to assist drivers in making informed decisions about when and where to charge their vehicles, now includes more than 45,000 global charging stations with real-time availability information.\nTomTom On-Street Parking service was expanded to 100 European cities. The service provides drivers with the probability of finding a parking space on the street, as well as the average search-time. We also launched TomTom Audio Traffic, where personalised traffic reports relevant to the specific route are delivered over voice to drivers.\nTelematics\n(€ in millions, unless stated otherwise) Q1 '18 Q1 '17 y.o.y.\nchange\nSubscriptions 33.2 30.7 8% Hardware and other services 1 9.6 9.3 3% Total Telematics revenue 42.8 39.9 7% Monthly revenue per subscription (€) 13.4 14.3 -6% Subscriber installed base (# in thousands) 826 723 14% Change percentages and totals calculated before rounding.\n1 Other services revenue comprises installation services and separately purchased traffic service and/or map content.\nTelematics revenue for the quarter was €43 million, 7% higher compared with the same quarter last year. The recurring subscription revenue for the quarter increased by 8% year on year to €33 million (Q1 '17: €31 million). Monthly revenue per subscription decreased by 6% year on year, mainly due to a mix effect caused by growing aftermarket connected car volumes, which are priced at lower levels compared with the traditional fleet management services.\nAt the end of Q1 '18, Telematics reached 826,000 fleet management and connected car subscriptions. This represents a 14% year on year increase, from 723,000 subscriptions at the end of Q1 '17.\nConsumer\n(€ in millions, unless stated otherwise) Q1 '18 Q1 '17 y.o.y.\nchange\nConsumer products 57.0 82.9 -31% Automotive hardware 12.2 12.7 -4% Total Consumer revenue 69.2 95.6 -28% Change percentages and totals calculated before rounding.\nTotal Consumer revenue for the quarter was €69 million, a decline of 28% compared with the same quarter last year (Q1 '17: €96 million), reflecting a decrease in Consumer products and to a lesser extent in Automotive hardware revenue.\nData, software & services and Hardware revenue split\n(€ in millions) Q1 '18 Q1 '17 y.o.y.\nchange\nData, software & services 130.4 130.3 0% Hardware 61.3 82.7 -26% Total revenue 191.8 213.0 -10% Change percentages and totals calculated before rounding.\nData, software & services revenue in the quarter was €130 million, flat compared with the same quarter prior year. As a percentage of total revenue, data, software & services increased to 68% in Q1 '18 from 61% in Q1 '17. Hardware revenue for the quarter was €61 million, 26% lower compared with €83 million in Q1 '17.\nGross margin\nThe gross margin for the quarter was 70%, seven percentage points higher compared with 63% in Q1 '17, reflecting the shift of revenue mix towards higher margin data, software & services revenue.\nAt constant currency rates for the US dollar and GB pound, Q1 '18 gross margin would have been 67% and the operating result would have been €3.7 million lower.\nOperating expenses\nTotal operating expenses for the quarter were €127 million, which is €8 million lower compared with the same quarter last year (Q1 '17: €135 million). The decrease in R&D, SG&A and marketing expenses is driven by our decreasing Consumer segment. The decrease is partly offset by increased investments in research and development in our navigation technology.\nDepreciation and amortisation\n(€ in millions) Q1 '18 Q1 '17 y.o.y.\nchange\nCost of sales 1.4 2.6 -46% Research and development 2.0 3.0 -33% Amortisation of technology & databases 24.1 22.4 7% Marketing 0.1 0.1 0% Selling, general and administrative 9.8 7.4 32% Total 37.4 35.5 5% Of which acquisition-related amortisation 13.1 13.9 -6% Change percentages and totals calculated before rounding.\nTotal depreciation and amortisation expenses amounted to €37 million in the quarter, 5% higher compared with last year (Q1 '17: €36 million). This increase is caused by higher amortisation of technology and databases, which is a result of increased capital expenditures in the past years.\nFX sensitivity\n(€ in millions, unless stated otherwise) Q1 '18\nactual Q1 '18\nrecalculated at\nQ1 '17\nFX rates 1\nRevenue 191.8 196.2 Gross result 133.5 132.4 Gross margin 70% 67% EBIT 6.9 3.2 EBIT margin 4% 2% FX RATES IN € Q1 '18 Q1 '17 US dollar 1.22 1.06 GB pound 0.88 0.86 ¹The Q1 '18 income and expense in US dollar and GB pound have been converted\nto euro using Q1 '17 average exchange rates.
