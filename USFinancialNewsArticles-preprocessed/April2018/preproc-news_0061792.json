    "text": "PITTSBURGH--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Limbach Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: LMB) (“Limbach” or the “Company”) announced today the appointment of Laurel J. Krzeminski, the chief financial officer of Granite Construction Incorporated (NYSE: GVA), to the Company’s Board of Directors, effective as of June 1, 2018. Ms. Krzeminski will also serve on the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and upon her appointment, Limbach’s Board of Directors will consist of 3 Class A Directors, 2 Class B Directors and 2 Class C Directors.\nSince November 2010, Ms. Krzeminski has served in her current position as chief financial officer of Granite Construction Incorporated (“Granite Construction”), a New York Stock Exchange listed company that is one of the nation’s largest diversified infrastructure providers and construction materials producers. In December 2015, Ms. Krzeminski was also named an executive vice-president of the firm. Prior to joining Granite Construction, Ms. Krzeminski worked for The Gillette Company (“Gillette”), and subsequently, with Procter and Gamble which in October 2005 merged with Gillette which was later dissolved into the parent company. During her tenure with Gillette and Procter and Gamble, she held several corporate and operational finance positions that include serving as the director of Gillette’s Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 Compliance program; the director of corporate financial reporting for Gillette and as a finance director for the Duracell and Braun North American business units. Ms. Krzeminski also has several years of experience in public accounting with an international accounting firm. Ms. Krzeminski is currently a member of the board of directors of Terracon. She received a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration-Accounting from San Diego State University.\nCharlie Bacon, CEO of Limbach commented, “We are pleased to welcome Laurel to our Board of Directors. Laurel has an extensive background in accounting and finance working for major corporations. This, in combination with her knowledge of the capital markets, and the unique operational and accounting challenges inherent to the construction industry, makes her an ideal choice for our Board of Directors.\n“Over time we have worked to develop a team of top-shelf level executives that bring to the Company’s Board of Directors an extensive background and knowledge of the industry, capital markets experience and whose attributes will contribute greatly to the overall growth and expansion of our business. Laurel adds further depth to our board, following our latest appointee, Mike McNally, former CEO of Skanska USA, who joined the Company’s Board of Directors last September and whose leadership skills are already a valuable resource for the Company. We anticipate a similar result with the addition of Laurel. We know she will be an asset to Limbach and again, welcome her to the Company’s Board.”\nAbout Limbach\nLimbach Holdings, Inc. is an integrated building systems provider, managing all components of mechanical, electrical, plumbing and control systems, from system design and construction through performance and maintenance.
