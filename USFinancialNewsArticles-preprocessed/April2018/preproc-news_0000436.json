    "text": "April 3, 2018 / 9:33 AM / Updated 8 hours ago Cricket-Philander sparkles as S Africa crush Australia in record win Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nJOHANNESBURG, April 3 (Reuters) - Vernon Philander grabbed six wickets in a devastating spell of swing bowling as South Africa crushed Australia by a record 492 runs to clinch the four-match series 3-1 at the Wanderers on Tuesday. \nThe scandal-hit tourists had promised to fight for a draw on the final day to end a controversial tour on a positive note, but their resistance lasted just 83 minutes as Philander ripped through their middle and lower order to finish with career-best figures of 6-21 and move to 204 test wickets. \nAustralia were bowled out for a paltry 119 in their second innings to succumb to their heaviest ever loss to South Africa in terms of runs, their second biggest defeat against any opponent and the fourth biggest loss in test cricket. \nSouth Africa completed their biggest victory over the Australians in tests in terms of runs, and also completed their first home series win over the demoralised visitors since 1970.
