    "text": "April 12, 2018 / 5:47 AM / Updated 6 hours ago Taliban storm district in Afghanistan's Ghazni province, killing more than 12 people Mustafa Andalib 2 Min Read \nGHAZNI, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Taliban militants over-ran a district in Afghanistan’s Ghazni province on Thursday, killing more than a dozen people including the district’s governor before retreating, a police official said. Afghan National Army (ANA) soldiers stand guard at the check post in Khawaja Omari district of Ghazni province, Afghanistan April 12, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer \nGhazni’s Khawaja Omari district was considered one of the province’s safest areas. \nThe militants killed district governor Ali Dost Shams, his bodyguards, seven police and five government intelligence agents, said Ramazan Ali Mohseni, deputy police chief in Ghazni. At least 45 to 50 militants were killed, he said. \nThe Taliban then torched the district headquarters, he said. Later, the Taliban left the headquarters and government security forces returned. \nBodies wrapped in blankets were laid on the ground of the district compound by late Thursday morning.
