    "text": "CNBC.com iStock | Getty Images Plus \nAs students commit to a college this spring, they face yet another hurdle: Finding the money for four years of tuition payments. \nWith the cost of college and student loan balances climbing, some parents and their children will clamor for any and all help available. \nYet both prospective and current students should heed this warning: That scholarship or seminar could actually be a scam. \n\"If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is,\" said Gregory Ashe, senior staff attorney at the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection . \"It sounds corny, but it's true.\" Questionable scholarship applications \nOne of the big clues that a scholarship could be swindling students for money is whether you are asked to pay an application fee. \nAbout 41 percent of college students said they were asked to pay up when applying for a scholarship, according to a recent survey of 1,000 college students by The Student Loan Report . Of those who were asked to hand over money, 73 percent did. \n\"Never pay any kind of fee, no matter how reasonable it seems, when applying for a scholarship,\" said Mark Kantrowitz, a student loan expert and publisher at the website Private Student Loans Guru . \nWhile the College Scholarship Fraud Prevention Act of 2000 helped to reduce these scams by creating stricter penalties, they do still pop up. \nAn application fee as small as $3 may not sound like much. But if there are more than 100,000 applicants and the scholarship is only around $180,000, for example, the profits from those fees will exceed the actual scholarship, Kantrowitz said. \nAnd the chances you will actually be awarded the money could be small. \nRemember, too, that these organizations do not need your Social Security number, according to Kantrowitz. \nAlso, watch out for scholarships that require work as part of the application. Kantrowitz cited one application that required law students to come up with solutions to a hypothetical legal scenario. It turns out the case was actually real for the party that was offering the scholarship. \nBecause there are a number of free scholarship search websites available, you shouldn't have to pay to search for these opportunities, Ashe said. show chapters",
