The announcement comes after a year in which Janrain achieved a host of important industry-first milestones while surpassing commercial 3,400 clients and reaching over 1.5 billion digital identities.\nEtchieson, a visionary executive leader with extensive experience in building high performing teams, marrying innovative product strategy with world-class execution, and bringing cutting-edge products and capabilities to market, has been chartered with spearheading Janrain's product strategy and development. In this capacity, he will work closely with Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Samsung, Wells Fargo, Whole Foods and other global clients to deliver on their mission-critical CIAM needs through the use of the industry-leading Janrain Identity Cloud®. He will report directly to CEO Jim Kaskade.\n\"I am very excited to welcome Todd to the Janrain family as we could not have found a more qualified professional with such a strong success record driving customer-first, data and analytics-driven product initiatives at high growth tech companies,\" said Janrain CEO Jim Kaskade. \"Janrain is now the largest independent CIAM leader in the industry, which puts us in a unique position to continue setting the pace for specialized innovation and prioritizing client needs over anything else.

Previously he led market strategy and product management for surveillance technologies at Flir Systems. Etchieson has also held leadership positions at Nike, open telecom solutions provider RadiSys, and Nortel Networks.\n\"I'm thrilled to be joining Janrain and its culture of customer-first and industry-first innovation, where I'll feel right at home,\" said Etchieson. \"2018 is going to be a big year for identity management, and so it's a tremendous opportunity to be joining Janrain, the industry's biggest innovator, where I can apply my own experience and expertise in bringing new solutions and capabilities that help global organizations better understand and serve their customers.\"\nAbout Janrain\nFounded in 2002, Janrain pioneered Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) and is widely recognized by industry analysts as a global CIAM leader.
