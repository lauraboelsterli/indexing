(NYSE: OPY) today reported net income of $6.7 million or $0.51 basic net income per share for the first quarter of 2018 compared with a net loss of $4.8 million or $0.36 basic net loss per share for the first quarter of 2017. Income before income taxes from continuing operations was $9.6 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with a loss before income taxes from continuing operations of $7.0 million for the first quarter of 2017.

A continuing strong economy, low unemployment, and lower individual and corporate tax rates were not sufficient to offset uncertainty around interest rate increases, threats of increased tariffs, and a potential trade war. These factors as well as continued political uncertainty in Washington dampened investor enthusiasm during the period. The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates by 25 basis points in March 2018, the sixth 25 basis point increase since the Fed began raising rates in December 2015. The increase in short-term interest rates coupled with low inflation expectations led to a narrowing of the spread between the 2-Year and the 10-Year Treasury Yields to lows not seen since the fourth quarter of 2007.\nAlbert G. Lowenthal, Chairman and CEO commented, \"Our results continued to improve during the period driven by increased investment banking activity, higher asset management fee-based revenues, as well as higher fees from the FDIC-insured bank deposit program. Retail and institutional commission revenues declined overall for the period reflecting the continued downward trend in the transaction-based business as investors continued to show a preference for passive strategies amid lower levels of focus on individual security selection and lower turnover. Investment banking results were positively impacted by increased participations in equities underwritings and higher advisory fees from M&A transactions. The fee-based business continued to perform well, driven by higher asset valuations over the comparable period as clients continue to embrace a managed product solution. Increases in short-term interest rates continued to benefit our bank deposit fee income. We are increasingly optimistic that these positive trends will continue and that we can continue to build momentum for our business.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nCommission revenue was $83.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 3.8% compared with $86.7 million for the first quarter of 2017 due to lower transaction-based revenues in both the retail and institutional businesses during the first quarter of 2018.\nAdvisory fees were $77.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 11.7% compared with $69.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 due to a higher level of client assets under management (\"AUM\").\nInvestment banking revenue increased 56.5% to $28.2 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with $18.0 million for the first quarter of 2017 due to higher equity underwriting fees as well as higher merger and acquisition advisory fees during the first quarter of 2018.\nBank deposit sweep income was $25.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 79.1% compared with $14.1 million for the first quarter of 2017 due to higher short-term interest rates during the first quarter of 2018.\nInterest revenue was $12.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 15.7% compared with $10.6 million for the first quarter of 2017 due primarily to an increase in interest revenue on margin extended to customers during the first quarter of 2018.\nPrincipal transactions revenue decreased 49.3% to $2.7 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with $5.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 due to lower trading income from corporate and municipal bonds during the first quarter of 2018.\nBusiness Segment Results (Unaudited)\n('000s)\nFor the 3-Months Ended\n3/31/2018\n3/31/2017\n%\nRevenue\nPrivate Client\n$\n154,094\n$\n137,389\n12.2\nAsset Management\n17,644\n18,666\n(5.5)\nCapital Markets\n61,529\n55,903\n10.1\nCorporate/Other\n1,263\n1,303\n(3.1)\n234,530\n213,261\n10.0\nIncome (Loss) Before Income Taxes from Continuing Operations\nPrivate Client\n40,162\n28,762\n39.6\nAsset Management\n3,718\n3,711\n0.2\nCapital Markets\n(6,057)\n(12,614)\n(52.0)\nCorporate/Other\n(28,198)\n(26,884)\n4.9\n$\n9,625\n$\n(7,025)\n*\n*\nPercentage not meaningful.\nPrivate Client\nPrivate Client reported revenue of $154.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, 12.2% higher than the first quarter of 2017 due to increased advisory fee revenue from higher AUM, higher fees earned on client deposits in the FDIC-insured bank deposit program, and higher margin interest revenue during the first quarter of 2018. Income before income taxes was $40.2 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 39.6% compared with the first quarter of 2017 due to the increases in revenue referred to above during the first quarter of 2018.\nClient assets under administration were $84.9 billion at March 31, 2018 compared with $86.9 billion at December 31, 2017, a decrease of 2.3%.\nFinancial adviser headcount was 1,082 at the end of the first quarter of 2018, down from 1,159 at the end of the first quarter of 2017. The decline in financial adviser headcount since the first quarter of 2017 has resulted from the Company's attention to adviser productivity. The decline in headcount also has been impacted by retirements and normal attrition.\nRetail commissions were $51.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 1.4% from the first quarter of 2017 due to reduced transaction volumes from retail investors during the first quarter of 2018.\nAdvisory fee revenue on traditional and alternative managed products was $60.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 16.9% from the first quarter of 2017 (see Asset Management below for further information). The increase in advisory fees was due to the increase in the value of AUM.\nBank deposit sweep income was $25.3 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 79.1% compared with $14.1 million for the first quarter of 2017 due to higher short-term interest rates during the first quarter of 2018.\nAsset Management\nAsset Management reported revenue of $17.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, 5.5% lower than the first quarter of 2017 due to a change in the method of reporting management fees earned through an investment adviser of alternative investments during the first quarter of 2018. Income before income taxes was $3.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 0.2% compared with the first quarter of 2017.\nAdvisory fee revenue on traditional and alternative managed products was $17.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 3.3% from the first quarter of 2017. Advisory fees are calculated based on the value of AUM at the end of the prior quarter which totaled $28.3 billion at December 31, 2017 ($24.8 billion at December 31, 2016) and are allocated to the Private Client and Asset Management business segments.\nAUM increased 9.3% to $28.2 billion at March 31, 2018 compared with $25.8 billion at March 31, 2017. AUM at March 31, 2018 is the basis for advisory fee billings for the second quarter of 2018. The increase in AUM was comprised of asset appreciation of $1.3 billion and net contributions of assets of $1.1 billion.\nCapital Markets\nCapital Markets reported revenue of $61.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, 10.1% higher than the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher equities underwriting and merger and acquisition advisory fees partially offset by lower institutional equities and fixed income commissions during the first quarter of 2018. Loss before income taxes was $6.1 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with a loss before income taxes of $12.6 million for the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to a charge related to a value-added tax assessment levied by the Israel VAT Authority in the first quarter of 2017.\nInstitutional equities commissions decreased 3.3% to $23.2 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with the first quarter of 2017 as higher volatility during late January and early February of 2018 was not enough to offset lower client trading activity in March of 2018.\nAdvisory fees from investment banking activities increased 23.6% to $8.9 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the first quarter of 2017 due to higher fees earned on completed mergers and acquisitions transactions during the first quarter of 2018.\nEquity underwriting fees increased 347.1% to $15.2 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with the first quarter of 2017 due to the Company's increased focus on equity issuance leading to higher equity underwriting activity during the first quarter of 2018.\nRevenue from Taxable Fixed Income decreased 15.4% to $12.1 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with the first quarter of 2017 due to concerns around a rising interest rate environment which led to decreased institutional fixed income activity during the first quarter of 2018.\nPublic Finance and Municipal Trading revenue decreased 52.0% to $2.4 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared with the first quarter of 2017 due to lower municipal income trading revenue amid more volatile markets.\nCompensation and Related Expenses\nCompensation and related expenses (including salaries, production and incentive compensation, share-based compensation, deferred compensation, and other benefit-related items) totaled $153.1 million during the first quarter of 2018, an increase of 6.4% compared with the first quarter of 2017. Higher production-related, incentive, and share-based compensation expenses were partially offset by lower deferred compensation costs during the first quarter of 2018. Compensation and related expenses as a percentage of revenue was 65.3% during the first quarter of 2018 compared with 67.5% during the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-Compensation Expenses\nNon-compensation expenses were $71.8 million during the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of 6.0% compared with $76.4 million during the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to a charge related to a value-added tax assessment levied by the Israel VAT Authority in the first quarter of 2017 as well as lower legal and regulatory costs partially offset by higher interest costs during the first quarter of 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 was 30.3% (tax expense) compared with 24.0% (tax benefit) for the first quarter of 2017 and reflects the Company's estimate of the annual effective tax rate adjusted for certain discrete items. The low estimated effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 is due to the lower Federal tax rate of 21% (versus 35%) as a result of the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") in December 2017 offset by foreign income inclusion and larger non-deductible expenses related to items such as entertainment, fringe benefits, regulatory fines and penalties, and limitations around the deductibility of executive compensation under the TCJA.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nAt March 31, 2018, total equity was $530.5 million compared with $523.9 million at December 31, 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, book value per share was $40.04 (compared with $39.55 at December 31, 2017) and tangible book value per share was $27.20 (compared with $26.74 at December 31, 2017).\nThe Company's level 3 assets, primarily auction rate securities, were $87.5 million at March 31, 2018 (compared with $87.6 million at December 31, 2017).\nDividend Announcement\nThe Company today announced a quarterly dividend in the amount of $0.11 per share payable on May 25, 2018 to holders of Class A non-voting and Class B voting common stock of record on May 11, 2018.\nCompany Information\nOppenheimer Holdings Inc., through its operating subsidiaries, is a leading middle market investment bank and full service broker-dealer that provides a wide range of financial services including retail securities brokerage, institutional sales and trading, investment banking (both corporate and public finance), research, market-making, trust, and investment management.
