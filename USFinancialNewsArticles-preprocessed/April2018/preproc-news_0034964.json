    "text": "April 17, 2018 / 2:55 PM / Updated 16 minutes ago EU expected to block Brazil chicken exports: agriculture minister Jake Spring 3 Min Read \nBRASÍLIA (Reuters) - The European Union is planning to block exports from nine BRF SA poultry plants to the trade bloc and may also revoke import credentials for other Brazilian chicken plants, Brazil’s agriculture minister said on Tuesday.

REUTERS/Ueslei Marcelino \nMinister Blairo Maggi said Brazil would launch an effort to appeal the ban before the World Trade Organization. \nMaggi said he expected the EU to issue a final list of banned Brazilian plants on Wednesday that includes the BRF plants and potentially those owned by other companies, following a planned vote by the European Commission on the matter. \nThe European Union is masking its commercial motives for the import ban with sanitation concerns that don’t have a technical basis, according to Maggi, who spoke at a news briefing. His remarks follow his return from a trade mission in Brussels last week aimed at convincing Europe not to ban Brazilian poultry products. \n“We are suffering from a commercial embargo, it’s not a question of sanitation,” Maggi said. \nSuch barriers do not comply with WTO rules, and Brazil will seek to open a panel before the trade body to discuss it, the first step in its dispute resolution process, he said. \nThe government’s position is not fully defined and the ministry must still discuss the move with the foreign ministry, Maggi said. \n“This issue of a trade war, we have seen the United States with ‘America first’ but there is also ‘Europe first,’” Maggi said. “This is headed to a difficult place for everyone involved.” Related Coverage \nThe controversy over chicken exports arose after Brazilian federal police implicated BRF in a new phase of a police investigation that alleged it sought to circumvent food safety standards. \nMaggi said there was no evidence, however, of problems with the sanitary conditions of Brazilian chicken. \nBRF declined to comment. \nShares in BRF, Brazil’s largest chicken exporter, fell 2.57 percent in afternoon trading. \nBrazil self-imposed an export suspension for BRF poultry exports to the EU 30 days ago that affected 10 out of 35 BRF plants in Brazil. A story in newspaper Valor Econômico said on Tuesday said a total of 15 could be impacted by a definitive embargo. \nThe country exported 6,400 tonnes of chicken per month to the European Union on average in 2017, trade group ABPA said, declining to comment further. \nBrazil sold $317 million worth of fresh salted chicken to the EU last year and $118 million worth of unsalted fresh chicken, according to a presentation by the minister.
