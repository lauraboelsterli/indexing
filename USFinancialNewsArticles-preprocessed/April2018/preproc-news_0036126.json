Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) speaks after the Republican policy luncheon on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., March 20, 2018. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts \n“Well, I don’t think he should fire Mueller. And I don’t think he is going to,” McConnell said. Asked about support by his Senate colleagues for such legislation, he replied: “Yes, but I’m the one who decides what we take to the floor. That’s my responsibility as the Majority Leader. And we will not be having this on the floor of the Senate.” Reporting by Eric Walsh, editing by G Crosse",
