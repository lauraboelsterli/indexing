    "text": "Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross offered an apology Thursday to two black men who were arrested last week at a Starbucks, an incident that has renewed a national discussion on how police and businesses treat African-Americans.\n“It is me who in large part made most of the situation worse than it was,” Mr. Ross said at a news conference. “So for that, it is my sincere apology to those two men, and even to these officers and to the other people around this city who I have failed in a variety of ways on this incident.”\n ",
