    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook Inc Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg will testify next week before a congressional committee over a political consulting firm’s misuse of customer data to interfere in the U.S. presidential election, U.S. lawmakers said on Wednesday. Zuckerberg will appear before the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee on April 11, the panel said on Wednesday.\nFILE PHOTO: Facebook Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks on stage during the annual Facebook F8 developers conference in San Jose, California, U.S., April 18, 2017. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo “This hearing will be an important opportunity to shed light on critical consumer data privacy issues and help all Americans better understand what happens to their personal information online,” the panel’s Republican chairman Greg Walden and top Democrat Frank Pallone said in a statement.\nFacebook has come under fire in recent weeks after it was revealed that political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, which worked for Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, gained access to the personal data of 50 million Facebook users.\nFacebook said in March it had suspended the accounts of Cambridge Analytica and its parent company and hired forensic auditors to probe whether Cambridge Analytica still had the data.\nFacebook also said at the time it would investigate all applications that had gotten access to large amounts of data before the firm changed its platform in 2014, would further restrict developers’ data access and roll out a tool to let users more easily revoke access by applications to their data.\nZuckerberg said in March he would testify before Congress, but he turned down an invitation by British lawmakers to explain to a parliamentary committee what had happened.\nThe technology company has faced pressure to do more, both in terms of protecting user privacy and stopping “information warfare” on its platform.\nIn February, 13 Russian nationals were indicted for using Facebook and other social media sites to interfere in the U.S. presidential election.\nOn Tuesday, Facebook announced it had removed hundreds of accounts and pages associated with the Russia-based Internet Research Agency that included fake activist and political posts in the 2016 U.S. election campaign.\nAmerican spy agencies have warned that Russia would try to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections by using social media to spread propaganda.\nSince March 16, when the news about Cambridge Analytica was disclosed, Facebook shares have fallen nearly 18 percent. The stock was down 2.7 percent on Wednesday.\nTwo other U.S. congressional committees have asked Zuckerberg to appear. A Facebook spokesman said conversations with the other panels were continuing.\nEditing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jeffrey Benkoe\n ",
