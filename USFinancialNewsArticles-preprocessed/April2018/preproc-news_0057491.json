    "text": "Delivered solid first-quarter financial performance after adjusting for the impacts of weather Updated capital forecast includes additional investments for 2018 to support continued customer growth and build a more efficient, reliable and secure system\nPORTLAND, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Portland General Electric Company (NYSE: POR) today reported net income of $64 million, or 72 cents per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018. This compares with net income of $73 million, or 82 cents per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. The company is reaffirming 2018 earnings guidance of $2.10 - $2.25 per diluted share.\n“PGE is committed to leading our region to a clean and reliable energy future,” said Maria Pope, PGE president and CEO. “In addition to solid financial results in the first quarter of 2018, we’re taking steps to add 100 average megawatts of renewable power to our system; increasing our investments in building a smarter, more resilient grid; and proposing programs to help our customers reach their decarbonization goals, while keeping prices affordable.”\nQ1 2018 earnings compared to Q1 2017 earnings\nWeather drove the decrease in first quarter earnings per diluted share for 2018 in comparison to first quarter of 2017. This decrease was partially offset by a decrease in distribution-related expenses, as there were no major storms in 2018 as compared to 2017, combined with lower plant maintenance expenses.\nCompany Update\nRenewable Request for Proposal (RFP)\nFollowing acknowledgement of a 100 MWa renewable need in PGE’s 2016 Integrated Resource Plan, PGE has moved forward with the procurement of additional renewable resources by submitting a Final Draft RFP for Renewable Resources to the Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC) on March 9, 2018. The RFP process will include oversight by an independent evaluator and review by the OPUC. PGE intends to submit a benchmark proposal for the Renewable RFP.\nThe company expects the Final RFP to be issued in May, with proposals due by June. A shortlist of proposals would be submitted to the OPUC in October 2018, with PGE issuing notice to proceed, as applicable, by December 31, 2018.\nFirst quarter operating results\nEarnings Reconciliation of Q1 2017 to Q1 2018 ($ in millions, except EPS) Pre-Tax\nIncome\nNet Income* Diluted\nEPS**\nReported Q1 2017 $ 96 $ 73 $ 0.82 Revenue Electric Retail price change (1 ) (1 ) — Electric Retail volume change (30 ) (22 ) (0.24 ) Change in decoupling deferral (8 ) (6 ) (0.07 ) Electric wholesale price and volume change 15 10 0.12 Other items (13 ) (9 ) (0.10 ) Change in Revenue (37 ) (28 ) (0.29 ) Power Cost Change in average power cost 13 9 0.10 Change in purchased power and generation (2 ) (1 ) (0.01 ) Change in Power Costs 11 8 0.09 O&M Generation, transmission, distribution 12 9 0.10 Administrative and general (2 ) (1 ) (0.02 ) Change in O&M 10 8 0.08 Other Items Depreciation & amortization (8 ) (6 ) (0.07 ) AFDC Equity*** 2 2 0.02 Other Items (2 ) (1 ) (0.02 ) Adjustment for effective vs statutory tax rate including tax reform 8 0.09 Change in Other Items (8 ) 3 0.02 Reported Q1 2018 $ 72 $ 64 $ 0.72 * After tax adjustments based on PGE’s statutory tax rate of 27.5% ** Some values may not foot due to rounding *** Statutory tax rate does not apply to AFDC equity Total revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased $37 million, or 7%, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017, consisting primarily of a $52 million decrease in Total retail revenues, partially offset by a $15 million increase in Wholesale revenues.\nThe change in Retail revenues consisted of the following contributing factors:\nA $30 million decrease resulted from a 6% decrease in retail energy deliveries due largely to the effects of weather on electricity demand, which is reflected predominantly in the Residential revenue line in the table below. Considerably warmer temperatures in the first quarter of 2018 than experienced in 2017, which was colder than average, drove deliveries lower in 2018 than in 2017; A $15 million net decrease to reflect the deferral of revenues for estimated refund to customers as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This reduction in revenues is offset with lower income tax expense, resulting in no overall net income impact; and An $8 million decrease resulting from the Decoupling mechanism as an estimated $1 million refund was recorded in 2018, as opposed to an estimated $7 million collection in 2017.\nTotal heating degree-days for the three months ended March 31, 2018 were 19% below those for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 3% below average.\nThe following table indicates the number of heating degree-days for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, along with 15-year averages based on weather data provided by the National Weather Service, as measured at Portland International Airport:\nHeating Degree-days 2018 2017 Avg. January 595 969 723 February 625 672 575 March 546 530 515 Totals 1,766 2,171 1,813 (Decrease)/increase from the 15-year average (3 )% 20 % Wholesale revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased $15 million, or 115%, from the three months ended March 31, 2017, with the increase comprised of $13 million related to a 99% increase in wholesale sales volumes and $1 million related to an 8% increase in average wholesale sales prices. Due to lower than expected retail customer demand and depressed natural gas prices in the first three months of 2018, the Company economically generated and sold more power into the Wholesale market than in the comparable period of 2017.\nActual Net Variable Power Costs (NVPC) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased $26 million when compared with the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in purchased power and fuel was driven by a 9% decrease in the average variable power cost per MWh, partially offset by a 2% increase in total system load. The overall decrease in Actual NVPC was also driven by a 115% increase in wholesale revenues. The change in wholesale revenues was due mostly to an 8% increase in wholesale sales price and a 99% increase in sales volume. For the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, actual NVPC was $11 million and $2 million below baseline NVPC, respectively.\nGeneration, transmission and distribution expense decreased $12 million, or 15%, in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared with the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily due to $8 million lower overall storm and service restoration costs, and $4 million lower maintenance and overhaul expense.\nAdministrative and other expense increased $2 million, or 3%, in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared with the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher legal costs and other expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared with the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase was primarily driven by a $5 million amortization credit in 2017 related to the Trojan spent fuel refund to customers, which was also reflected in reduced revenues, and $3 million increased plant depreciation and software amortization.\nInterest expense, net increased $1 million, or 3%, in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared with the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to $2 million higher expense resulting from a 3% increase in the average balance of outstanding debt, offset by a $1 million higher allowance for borrowed funds used during construction.\nIncome tax expense was $8 million in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared with $23 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017, with effective tax rates of 11.1% and 24.0%, respectively. The decrease in income tax expense was driven by lower pre-tax income taxed at a lower federal corporate tax rate pursuant to the TCJA.\n2018 earnings guidance\nPGE reaffirms its 2018 guidance of $2.10 - $2.25 per diluted share. The guidance is based on the following assumptions:\nA decline in retail deliveries up to 1%, weather-adjusted Normal hydro conditions for the remainder of the year based on the current hydro forecast Wind generation for the remainder of the year based on five years of historical levels or forecast studies when historical data is not available Normal thermal plant operations for the remainder of the year Depreciation and amortization expense between $365 and $385 million Operating and maintenance costs between $575 and $595 million\nFirst Quarter 2018 earnings call and webcast — April 27, 2018\nPGE will host a conference call with financial analysts and investors on Friday, April 27, 2018 at 11 a.m. EDT.
