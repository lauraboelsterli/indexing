    "text": "Executes the Second of Three Annual Steps to Increase Dividends by at Least 50 Percent Over a Three-Year Period\nDALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Celanese Corporation (NYSE:CE), a global technology and specialty materials company, today announced that its board of directors has approved a 17 percent increase in the company's quarterly common stock cash dividend.\nThe dividend increased from $0.46 to $0.54 per share of common stock on a quarterly basis and from $1.84 to $2.16 per share of common stock on an annual basis. The new dividend rate will be effective immediately.\n“Increasing our dividend consistently is a key element of our strategy to maximize long-term value for our shareholders. Today’s announcement marks the ninth consecutive year of dividend increases, and is both a reflection of our strong cash generation and confidence in the growth prospects for our business. During that period, the cash we have returned to shareholders through dividends has grown substantially to $241 million in 2017, versus $23 million in 2009,” said Mark Rohr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nRohr continued, “Last year, we committed to increasing our dividend by at least 50% over the three-year period through 2019 with a targeted payout of $300 million or more in 2019. This increase is the second of three annual steps to meet that goal.”\nThe company also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.54 per share on its Series A common stock, payable on May 10, 2018 to stockholders of record as of April 30, 2018.\nAbout Celanese\nCelanese Corporation is a global technology leader in the production of differentiated chemistry solutions and specialty materials used in most major industries and consumer applications.
