    "text": "LONGUEUIL, Quebec, Reunion Gold Corporation (TSX-V:RGD) (the “Company”) reports that it has closed its previously announced transaction with Union Minière de Saül (“UMS”) ( December 2, 2016 news release ). The transaction consists of an option to acquire an 80% interest in the Haute Mana gold project in French Guiana, South America by completing a preliminary economic assessment (“PEA”) on the project. Upon completion of the PEA, the Company will be deemed to have acquired an 80% interest in the project. UMS will then have the option to retain its 20% minority participating interest, convert its interest in a 5% net profit interest or sell its 20% interest to the Company at a price to be agreed to at that time.\nAs part of the closing, the parties entered into an amendment to the option agreement providing that (1) the option will be valid until January 1, 2024 (was previously a 5-year option) and (2) the Company will now oversee and pay for the environmental reclamation work described in a plan approved by the French mining authorities (replacing the loan of up to 250,000 euros to UMS).\nThe Haute Mana Project is a contiguous block of eight (8) mining concessions covering 121.5 km² in the central-south part of French Guiana, some 170 km SW from the capital city of Cayenne. Because of recent changes to the French mining Code, the concessions will be expiring on December 31, 2018. UMS has filed applications for the renewal of the concessions. Limited field work will be conducted by the Company on the concessions during the renewal process.\nCautionary Statement\nThis press release contains certain forward-looking information as defined in applicable securities laws.
