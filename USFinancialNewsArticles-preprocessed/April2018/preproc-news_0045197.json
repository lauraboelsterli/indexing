    "text": "April 23, 2018 / 3:30 PM / Updated an hour ago Italy president appoints mediator to sound out chances of 5-Star/PD govt Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nROME (Reuters) - Italyâ€™s president has asked the head of the lower house of parliament to sound out the possibility of the 5-Star Movement forming a government with the center-left Democratic Party (PD), a presidential official said on Monday. \nHead of State Sergio Mattarella, who is struggling to end seven weeks of political deadlock following inconclusive elections last month, held talks with lower house speaker Roberto Fico and gave him until Thursday to report back with his findings. \nSenate leader Elisabetta Casellati last week failed to broker a deal between 5-Star and an alliance of center-right parties after receiving a similar, highly focused mandate from the president.
