Soccer Football - Europa League Quarter Final First Leg - Arsenal vs CSKA Moscow - Emirates Stadium, London, Britain - April 5, 2018 Arsenal's Henrikh Mkhitaryan lies on the pitch after sustaining an injury REUTERS/Eddie Keogh \nMkhitaryan limped off after 61 minutes during Arsenal’s 4-1 home win over CSKA Moscow last week and a scan confirmed the 29-year-old will face a spell on the sidelines. \n“Mkhitaryan has medial knee ligament damage,” Wenger told reporters after Arsenal’s 3-2 Premier League victory over Southampton on Sunday. \n“He will not be available for Thursday (against CSKA), Newcastle United away, or West Ham United the week after. He will miss these games but could still play at the end of the season.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Rutherford",
