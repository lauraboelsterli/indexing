    "text": "April 5 (Reuters) - Debt-laden telecoms firm Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) said on Thursday that Indiaâ€™s Supreme Court has lifted a ban on sale of its assets, and has ordered secured lenders to proceed with the sale.\nRCom also said it will file an appeal before the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Friday.\nThe company is \"confident of securing appropriate relief from the NCLAT to enable sales of tower and fibre assets to also be completed at the earliest,\" it said in a statement bit.ly/2q6iJOp.\nThe National Company Law Tribunal had halted RCom from selling any asset without its permission, following a legal challenge from Swedish telecoms gear maker Ericsson.
