    "text": "(Adds no comment from Downing Street, background)\nLONDON, April 11 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May is ready to give the go-ahead for Britain to take part in military action in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria, the BBC reported on Wednesday.\nMay would not seek prior parliamentary approval because she favoured taking action soon, the BBC said without citing its sources.\nA spokesman for May declined to comment on the report.\nEarlier on Wednesday, May said all the indications were that the Syrian authorities were responsible for the attack in the town of Douma and that such assaults could not go unchallenged.\nThe leader of the opposition Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, also speaking earlier on Wednesday, said parliament should be given a say on any military action May wants to take.
