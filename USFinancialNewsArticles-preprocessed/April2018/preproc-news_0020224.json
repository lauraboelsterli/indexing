FILE PHOTO - A company logo is pictured outside a branch of WH Smith in Manchester northern England, March 17, 2016. REUTERS/Phil Noble/File Photo \nWH Smith, which has over 1,300 stores, primarily in the UK, said group pretax profit for the six months to Feb. 28 fell 1 percent to 82 million pounds. \nTotal revenue from its high street business was down 5 percent with comparable sales falling 4 percent. \nHowever, total sales at its travel arm, made up of outlets at airports, railways stations, motorway services, hospitals and workplaces, rose 7 percent for the interim period.
