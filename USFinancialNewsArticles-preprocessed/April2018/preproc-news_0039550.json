    "text": "Improved care of patients with hypertension Improved processes of care for diabetes and mammography screening in Medicare patients \nThere is no evidence that the cost of participating in MOC is raising consumer health care costs, but there is evidence that it reduces them. One study noted a 2.5% reduction in the total cost of care for Medicare beneficiaries treated by physicians participating in MOC . This represents an average savings of $167 per Medicare patient per year compared with patients treated by physicians not participating in MOC, amounting to a total cost reduction of approximately $5 billion annually. Furthermore, this cost reduction was not associated with any decline in quality outcomes. \nABMS has a longstanding policy that Board Certification and MOC should not be a requirement for licensure. The implication in Al-Agba and Edisonâ€™s commentary that licensure can be revoked by not participating in MOC is false. Board Certification is voluntary and physicians have alternatives to ABMS Board Certification. \nABMS and its Member Boards rely on a highly trained and specialized workforce including psychometricians, assessment professionals, and medical educators to develop, evaluate, validate, and administer Board Certification programs for more than 880,000 physicians. It stands to reason that the greatest expenditure is in staff compensation, and its executive compensation is aligned with like non-profit organizations. ABMS is fully compliant with all financial standards and conducts its operations efficiently and ethically. \nParticipation by specialty physicians in an ABMS Member Board MOC program has a positive impact on patient care, improves outcomes, and serves as an important tool for consumers, hospitals, and physicians. Their participation helps promote healthier communities, improve patient outcomes, and decrease health care costs. \nRichard E. Hawkins is the president and CEO of the American Board of Medical Specialties. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
