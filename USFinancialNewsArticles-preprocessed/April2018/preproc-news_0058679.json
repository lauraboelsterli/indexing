    "text": "April 27, 2018 / 9:53 AM / Updated 23 minutes ago Aso brace gives Hurricanes flattering win over Sunwolves Reuters Staff 3 Min Read\nWELLINGTON (Reuters) - Wellington Hurricanes inside centre Vince Aso crossed for four tries but only had two count as they beat Japan’s Sunwolves 43-15 on Friday to move to the top of the Super Rugby standings.\nAso, who crossed in the 74th and 79th minutes, had two earlier tries ruled out by the television match official Ben Skeen.\nThe first was chalked off for a marginal forward pass from Julian Savea and the second for a dangerous clear out by Ardie Savea some 70 metres downfield.\nJulian Savea, Finlay Christie, Reed Prinsep, Jordie Barrett and Brad Shields also scored for the home side, who moved to 32 points in the standings, two ahead of the Lions and three in front of the defending champion Canterbury Crusaders.\nThe Hurricanes, who had won their previous six games, only put the result beyond doubt in the final six minutes with three tries — two of which were scored by Aso.\nThe Sunwolves, who upset the Hurricanes’ flow, also dominated possession and territory but were unable to capitalise on their numerous opportunities.\nThey also caused havoc with the Hurricanes’ lineout but were constantly destroyed in the scrum, which accounted for two of the home side’s tries.\nAfter Aso’s first try was overturned in the third minute, the Sunwolves’ captain Pieter Labuschagne finished off a series of pick and goes by his fellow forwards to give the visitors a 7-0 lead.\nThe Hurricanes’ scrum dominance, however, started to take its toll and Christie and Prinsep both crossed courtesy of their stable attacking platform to give the hosts a 21-10 lead at the break.\nJordie Barrett scored an early second-half try to extend the advantage to 26-10, before Aso’s second disallowed try, which stemmed from a sweeping attacking move sparked by a Julian Savea burst. It was overturned for supposed foul play by Savea’s brother Ardie.\nThe Sunwolves then virtually camped in the Hurricanes’ half but were unable to capitalise in the face of some superb defence from the home side.\nWinger Kenki Fukuoka scored his side’s second try when he was the first to a speculative kick by Yutaka Nagare to reduce the deficit to 26-15 before Aso and Shields scored in the final six minutes to blow the score out.
