    "text": "NEW YORK, April 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- WeissLaw LLP is investigating possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law by the Board of Directors of RSP Permian, Inc. (\"RSPP\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: RSPP) in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by Concho Resources Inc. (\"CXO\") (NYSE: CXO) in a stock-for-stock transaction valued at approximately $9.5 billion, inclusive of debt. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company's shareholders will receive 0.32 of a share of CXO for each RSPP share they own, representing consideration of $50.24.\nWeissLaw is investigating whether RSPP's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement. Notably, at least one analyst set a target price of $69.00 per RSPP share, or nearly $19.00 above the per share consideration. Additionally, upon closing of the transaction, RSPP shareholders will own a meagre 25.5% of the combined company.\nGiven these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether RSPP shareholders will obtain their fair and proportionate share of the Company's continued success and growth prospects. If you own RSPP shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Joshua Rubin by telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com .\nWeissLaw LLP has litigated hundreds of stockholder class and derivative actions for violations of corporate and fiduciary duties. We have recovered over a billion dollars for defrauded clients and obtained important corporate governance relief in many of these cases. If you have information or would like legal advice concerning possible corporate wrongdoing (including insider trading, waste of corporate assets, accounting fraud, or materially misleading information), consumer fraud (including false advertising, defective products, or other deceptive business practices), or anti-trust violations, please email us at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com or fill out the form on our website, http://www.weisslawllp.com/rsp-permian-inc /\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/weisslaw-llp-investigates-rsp-permian-inc-acquisition-300635886.html\nSOURCE WeissLaw LLP",
