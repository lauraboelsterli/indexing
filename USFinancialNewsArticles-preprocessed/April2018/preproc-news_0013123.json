    "text": "Anthony Davis scored 28 points and grabbed 12 rebounds as the New Orleans Pelicans ended a four-game losing streak with a 123-95 victory against the visiting Memphis Grizzlies on Wednesday night in the Smoothie King Center.\nThe end to the Pelicans’ longest losing streak of the season enabled New Orleans to move one game in front of the idle Denver Nuggets in the battle for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference.\nThe Pelicans and the Minnesota Timberwolves are tied for the last two playoff positions. New Orleans, Minnesota and Denver each have four games remaining.\nDavis bounced back after having just 16 points and 25 points in his past two games after spraining an ankle against Portland eight days ago.\nE’Twaun Moore added a game-high 30 points, Nikola Mirotic scored 25, Jrue Holiday had 15 points and Rajon Rondo had 13 assists for New Orleans.\nPelicans reserve guard Ian Clark, who scored in double figures in seven of the previous 12 games, left the game for good after injuring his right ankle when he fell to the floor attempting a layup in the second quarter. X-rays were negative.\nMarShon Brooks scored 25 points, Ivan Rabb had 16, Jarell Martin 15 and Ben McLemore 14 for the Grizzlies, who lost for the 31st time in their past 34 road games.\nThe Pelicans had a 12-point halftime lead and used an 18-6 run at the start of the third quarter to take command.\nMirotic, who moved into the starting lineup in place of Emeka Okafor, scored seven points during the run, which left New Orleans with an 83-59 cushion.\nThe Pelicans scored the first 10 points of the game, and Davis had 14 points and four rebounds as they took a 32-23 lead after one quarter.\nThe Grizzlies twice got within three points before Moore and Mirotic each made a 3-pointer to help New Orleans build a 44-34 lead.\nMemphis got within six points twice, but Moore scored 10 points in the last 4:14 of the second quarter as New Orleans took a 65-53 halftime lead.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
