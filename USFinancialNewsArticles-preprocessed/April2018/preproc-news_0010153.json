    "text": "Temperatures may have been below freezing for most of the night, but that didn’t stop Cleveland Indians ace Corey Kluber from heating up Monday night against the Detroit Tigers.\nKluber looked like he was in midseason form in the cold, tossing eight dominant innings to help the Indians earn a 2-0 win over the Detroit Tigers.\nKluber (1-1) struck out 13 batters, the most strikeouts he has ever recorded against the Tigers, walked one and allowed just two hits in his masterpiece.\nAndrew Miller relieved Kluber in the ninth and pitched a scoreless frame to record the save and help Cleveland earn its first winning streak of the young season at two games.\nThe only offense Cleveland needed came in the fifth inning from Bradley Zimmer.\nWith two outs and a man on against Tigers starter Francisco Liriano (1-1), Zimmer launched a slider over the wall in right-center field for his first home run to give the Indians a 2-0 lead.\nLiriano pitched his second strong start of the season for the Tigers, going six innings and allowing two runs, three hits, three walks and striking out four on 97 pitches.\nBut for the second straight game, the Tigers could only manage two hits.\nUnlike Sunday’s 1-0 win over the White Sox though, the Tigers couldn’t find a way to scratch out a run against Kluber and Miller.\nOf Kluber’s 13 strikeouts, eight came on called third strikes.\nThe Tigers never had a runner advance to second base the entire game, although they had a momentary glimmer of hope in the top of the ninth.\nAfter Miller hit leadoff hitter Jacoby Jones, Jaimer Candelario struck out to bring up Tigers slugger Miguel Cabrera representing the tying run.\nBut Miller induced a groundball from Cabrera, which turned into a game-ending double play.\nJose Ramirez walked twice and had a hit for Cleveland, which only mustered four hits itself.\nBut thanks to Kluber and Zimmer, it didn’t matter.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
