    "text": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla., April 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Capital City Bank Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:CCBG) today reported net income of $5.8 million, or $0.34 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $3,000, or $0.00 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017, and $2.7 million, or $0.16 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2017.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 included a $1.5 million, or $0.09 per diluted share tax benefit related to a 2017 plan year pension plan contribution. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 included a $4.1 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, income tax expense related to the re-measurement of our net deferred tax asset due to tax reform.\nHIGHLIGHTS\nNet interest income up 1.3% sequentially and 10.3% over prior year 23 basis points cost of funds reflects the quality of our core deposit base (~ 35% noninterest bearing) Period-end loan growth 4.7% over prior year Continued efforts to restrain expense growth Net charge-offs of 20 basis points continues to reflect the quality of our loan portfolio Well capitalized with common equity tier 1 ratio of 13.4% and total risk based capital ratio of 17.0%\n“I am very encouraged by first quarter results,” said William G. Smith, Jr., Chairman, President and CEO. “Florida is strong and the demographics of our markets are improving. We are once again on the offense following a number of years playing defense after the crisis. Loan growth, rising rates and a phenomenal core deposit base are all contributing to higher net interest income. While we may be nearing the point of inflection, credit quality continues to improve. Lowering our efficiency ratio is a top priority and we have multiple strategies in place to grow our revenues and manage expenses. There is always more to be done, but I am pleased with our progress as we continue to focus on strategies that will produce long term value for our shareowners.”\nCompared to the fourth quarter of 2017, the $1.1 million decrease in operating profit reflected a $1.0 million increase in noninterest expense and lower noninterest income of $0.5 million, partially offset by higher net interest income of $0.3 million and a $0.1 million reduction in the loan loss provision.\nCompared to the first quarter of 2017, the $1.4 million increase in operating profit was attributable to higher net interest income of $2.0 million, partially offset by lower noninterest income of $0.2 million and a $0.4 million increase in the loan loss provision.\nOur return on average assets (“ROA”) was 0.81% and our return on average equity (“ROE”) was 8.14% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 0.39% and 4.00%, respectively, for the first quarter of 2017.\nDiscussion of Operating Results\nTax-equivalent net interest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $21.9 million compared to $21.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $20.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. During the first quarter of 2018, overnight funds increased as a result of seasonal growth in our public fund deposits, and to a lesser degree, savings accounts. A portion of these overnight funds were used to fund growth in the loan and investment portfolios. The increase in tax-equivalent net interest income compared to the first quarter of 2017 reflected growth in the loan portfolio and higher rates earned on overnight funds, investment securities, and variable rate loans, partially offset by a higher cost on our negotiated rate deposits.\nThe federal funds target rate increased six times since December 2015 to 1.75% at the end of the first quarter of 2018, which positively affected our net interest income due to favorable repricing of our variable and adjustable rate earning assets. Although these increases have also resulted in higher rates paid on our negotiated rate deposits, we continue to prudently manage our overall cost of funds, which was 23 basis points for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 18 basis points for fourth quarter of 2017 and 13 basis points for the first quarter 2017. Despite highly competitive fixed-rate loan pricing across most markets, we continue to review our loan pricing and make adjustments where appropriate.\nOur net interest margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 3.43%, a decrease of two basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of 22 basis points over the first quarter of 2017. Relative to both comparative periods, the average yield for each earning asset category improved. The decrease in the margin compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 was due to seasonal growth in our overnight funds, resulting in a slightly less favorable asset mix. The increase in the margin compared to the first quarter of 2017 was primarily attributable to loan growth and higher yields on overnight funds and investment securities, partially offset by higher rates on our negotiated rate deposits.\nThe provision for loan losses for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.7 million compared to $0.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $0.3 million for the first quarter of 2017. The higher provision compared to the first quarter of 2017 reflected higher loan charge-offs and growth in the loan portfolio. Net loan charge-offs for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $0.8 million compared to net loan charge-offs of $0.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $0.4 million for the first quarter of 2017. At March 31, 2018, the allowance for loan losses of $13.3 million represented 0.80% of outstanding loans (net of overdrafts) and provided coverage of 181% of nonperforming loans compared to 0.80% and 186%, respectively, at December 31, 2017 and 0.84% and 161%, respectively, at March 31, 2017.\nNoninterest income for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $12.5 million and reflected decreases of $0.5 million, or 3.3%, from the fourth quarter of 2017 and $0.2 million, or 1.9%, from the first quarter of 2017. The decrease from both prior periods was primarily attributable to lower mortgage banking fees and generally reflected a seasonal slowdown in loan funding, and to a lesser extent, a lower margin on sold loans.\nNoninterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $27.9 million, an increase of $1.0 million, or 3.8%, over the fourth quarter of 2017 attributable to higher compensation expense of $0.6 million, occupancy expense of $0.1 million, and other real estate owned expense of $0.3 million. The higher level of compensation expense was seasonal and reflected the reset of payroll taxes and incentives. The increase in occupancy expense was attributable to higher maintenance costs. Other real estate owned expense increased due to a valuation adjustment for one parcel of property.\nWe realized an income tax benefit of $0.2 million for the first quarter of 2018 which included a discrete tax benefit of $1.5 million resulting from the effect of federal tax reform, enacted in December 2017, on a pension plan contribution made in the first quarter of 2018 for the 2017 pension plan year. Absent this discrete item, our effective tax rate was approximately 24%. Income tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $6.7 million and included a $4.1 million discrete tax expense related to the re-measurement of our net deferred tax asset, also due to the federal tax reform enacted in December.\nDiscussion of Financial Condition\nAverage earning assets were $2.592 billion for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $80.5 million, or 3.2%, over the fourth quarter of 2017, and an increase of $63.3 million, or 2.5%, over the first quarter of 2017. The change in earning assets over both periods reflected a higher level of total deposits.\nWe maintained an average net overnight funds (deposits with banks plus fed funds sold less fed funds purchased) sold position of $240.9 million during the first quarter of 2018 compared to $174.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $245.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. The change in the average net overnight funds compared to both prior periods is related to variances in deposit balances which are discussed in further detail below.\nAverage loans increased $6.9 million, or 0.4% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, and have grown $62.1 million, or 3.9% when compared to the first quarter of 2017. The average increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily reflected growth in commercial mortgage, construction, and consumer loans, partially offset by a reduction in the remaining loan types. Average growth over the first quarter of 2017 was experienced in all loan categories, with the exception of commercial and home equity loans. A portion of this growth compared to the first quarter 2017 was attributable to three separate loan pool purchases totaling $28.9 million. The loans were individually reviewed and evaluated in accordance with our credit underwriting standards.\nWe continue to make minor modifications on some of our lending programs to mitigate the impact that consumer and business deleveraging has had on our portfolio. These programs, coupled with economic improvements in our anchor markets and strategic loan purchases, have helped increase overall loan growth.\nNonperforming assets (nonaccrual loans and OREO) totaled $10.6 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 4.3%, from December 31, 2017 and $7.2 million, or 40.2%, from March 31, 2017. Nonaccrual loans totaled $7.3 million at March 31, 2018, a $0.2 million increase over December 31, 2017 and a $1.0 million decrease from March 31, 2017. Nonaccrual loan additions totaled $3.8 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $5.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $2.9 million for the first quarter of 2017. The balance of OREO totaled $3.3 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $0.6 million and $6.2 million, respectively, from December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017. For the first quarter of 2018, we added properties totaling $0.3 million, sold properties totaling $0.4 million, and recorded valuation adjustments totaling $0.5 million.\nAverage total deposits were $2.456 billion for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $77.7 million, or 3.3% over the fourth quarter of 2017, and an increase of $48.8 million, or 2.0% over the first quarter of 2017. The increase in average deposits compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 reflected increases in negotiated NOW and savings accounts. Average deposits compared to first quarter of 2017 reflected strong growth in noninterest bearing deposits and savings accounts. Deposit levels remain strong, particularly given the increases in the fed funds rate. Average core deposits continue to experience growth. We monitor deposit rates on an ongoing basis as a prudent pricing discipline remains the key to managing our mix of deposits.\nAverage borrowings decreased $0.1 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and decreased $4.6 million compared to the first quarter of 2017. Declines over both prior periods were primarily due to payoffs of FHLB advances, partially offset by increases in repurchase agreements.\nShareowners’ equity was $288.4 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $284.2 million at December 31, 2017 and $278.1 million at March 31, 2017. Our leverage ratio was 10.36%, 10.47%, and 9.95%, respectively, on these dates. Further, at March 31, 2018, our risk-adjusted capital ratio was 17.04% compared to 17.10% and 16.44% at December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 13.43% at March 31, 2018, compared to 13.42% at December 31, 2017 and 12.77% at March 31, 2017. All of our capital ratios exceeded the threshold to be designated as “well-capitalized” under the Basel III capital standards.\nAbout Capital City Bank Group, Inc.\nCapital City Bank Group, Inc.
