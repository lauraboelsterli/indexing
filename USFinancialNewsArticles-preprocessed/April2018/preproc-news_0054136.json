Net revenue is calculated as revenue less transportation costs. EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) excluding the effects of depreciation, amortization, cash and non-cash interest expense and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (as previously defined) excluding the effects of changes in contingent consideration and stock compensation expense. Non-GAAP fully diluted EPS is defined as fully diluted earnings (loss) per share excluding changes in contingent consideration, amortization, non-cash interest expense, stock compensation expense and the tax effect of these adjustments. We believe such measures provide useful information to investors because they provide information about the financial performance of the Company's ongoing business.\nNet revenue, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Non-GAAP fully diluted EPS are used by management in its financial and operational decision-making and evaluation of overall operating performance. These measures may be different from similar measures used by other companies. The presentation of this financial information, which is not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles, is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. For a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the nearest comparable GAAP financial measure, see \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" included in this release.\nForward-Looking Statements\nAll statements made in this release, other than statements of historical fact, are or may be deemed to be These statements are under the federal securities laws.
