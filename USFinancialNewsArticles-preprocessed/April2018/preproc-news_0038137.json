    "text": "PRAGUE, April 16 (Reuters) - Czech banks tightened lending conditions for households in the first quarter and expect to tighten them further in the second quarter, the central bankâ€™s regular lending survey showed on Monday.\nThe bank said lending conditions for companies did not change substantially in the first three months of the year and were expected to remain unchanged in the second quarter.\nThe tightening for households stemmed mainly from the banks finishing implementation of central bank measures in mortgage lending, the survey said.
