    "text": "EditorsNote: Tweaks throughout\nThe Brooklyn Nets used a strong second half to get the game to overtime and then beat Miami 110-109 to prevent the Heat from clinching a playoff berth at AmericanAirlines Arena on Saturday.\nDwyane Wade’s potential game-winning layup rolled off the rim in the final seconds of overtime to give the Nets their third win in four games against Miami this season.\nRondae Hollis-Jefferson scored 20 points and had 14 rebounds for Brooklyn. Caris LeVert had 19 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists. Joe Harris and Quincy Acy each had 13 points.\nThe Nets earned their second straight road win for the second time this season and improved to 12-6 against the Southeast Division.\nGoran Dragic and James Johnson each had 18 points for the Heat. Kelly Olynyk scored 16.\nWade and Josh Richardson had 13 apiece. Hassan Whiteside scored 14, and Justise Winslow had 11.\nThe loss snapped the Heat’s nine-game home winning streak.\nMiami’s 112 points per game in March set the franchise record for most points averaged in a month.\nMiami slipped to the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference, a half-game behind Milwaukee.\nThe loss against Brooklyn was the Heat’s second game in a stretch of five contests that will have them playing four teams with losing records — Atlanta twice — giving them an opportunity to climb in the playoff standings.\nDragic’s hot hand early helped the Heat go on a 17-5 run and jump out to a 14-point lead as Miami made 6 of 9 3-pointers.\nThe left-hander finished the first quarter with 10 points and Olynyk added eight as the Heat led 32-22 after one.\nMiami closed the second quarter with an 8-2 run to lead 55-48 after Brooklyn trimmed it to 47-46 with 2:12 left in the first half.\nThe Nets took their first lead since early in the first quarter on a 10-2 run in the third and held an 80-76 lead after outscoring Miami 32-21.\nMiami rallied from a nine-point deficit with 7:15 remaining to force overtime.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
