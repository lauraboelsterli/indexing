    "text": "LONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - Britain’s media regulator said it had opened seven investigations into whether Russian news channel RT had broken impartiality rules in broadcasts made since a Russian double-agent was poisoned in the English city of Salisbury last month.\nThe regulator Ofcom had warned that RT producer TV Novosti could lose its right to broadcast in Britain if it failed its “fit and proper” test.\nRT did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
