    "text": "DALLAS, April 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI) (NASDAQ: TXN) today reported first-quarter revenue of $3.79 billion, net income of $1.37 billion and earnings per share of $1.35. Earnings per share include 14 cents in tax-related benefits not in the company's original guidance.\nRegarding the company's performance and returns to shareholders, Rich Templeton, TI's chairman, president and CEO, made the following comments:\n\"Revenue increased 11 percent from the same quarter a year ago. Demand for our Analog and Embedded Processing products continued to be strong in the industrial and automotive markets. \"Our cash flow from operations of $5.7 billion for the trailing 12 months again underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow for the trailing 12 months was up 17 percent from a year ago to $4.9 billion, or 32.1 percent of revenue. This reflects the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300-millimeter Analog production. \"We have returned $5.1 billion to owners in the past 12 months through stock repurchases and dividends, consistent with our strategy to return to owners all of our free cash flow. Over the last 12 months, our dividends represented 45 percent of free cash flow, emphasizing their sustainability. \"TI's second-quarter outlook is for revenue in the range of $3.78 billion to $4.10 billion, and earnings per share between $1.19 and $1.39, which includes an estimated $10 million discrete tax benefit. \"We now expect our ongoing annual operating tax rate to be about 16 percent starting in 2019 and 20 percent in 2018, lower than our previous expectations of 18 percent and 23 percent, respectively.\"\nFree cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is cash flow from operations less capital expenditures.\nEarnings summary\nAmounts are in millions of dollars, except per-share amounts.\n1Q18\n1Q17\nChange\nRevenue\n$\n3,789\n$\n3,402\n11%\nOperating profit\n$\n1,548\n$\n1,252\n24%\nNet income\n$\n1,366\n$\n997\n37%\nEarnings per share\n$\n1.35\n$\n0.97\n39%\nCash generation\nAmounts are in millions of dollars.\nTrailing 12 Months\n1Q18\n1Q18\n1Q17\nChange\nCash flow from operations\n$\n1,112\n$\n5,680\n$\n4,756\n19%\nCapital expenditures\n$\n189\n$\n757\n$\n534\n42%\nFree cash flow\n$\n923\n$\n4,923\n$\n4,222\n17%\nFree cash flow % of revenue\n32.1%\n30.7%\nCash return\nAmounts are in millions of dollars.\nTrailing 12 Months\n1Q18\n1Q18\n1Q17\nChange\nDividends paid\n$\n611\n$\n2,215\n$\n1,763\n26%\nStock repurchases\n$\n873\n$\n2,879\n$\n2,052\n40%\nTotal cash returned\n$\n1,484\n$\n5,094\n$\n3,815\n34%\nTEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n(Millions of dollars, except share and per-share amounts)\nFor Three Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nRevenue\n$\n3,789\n$\n3,402\nCost of revenue (COR)\n1,342\n1,258\nGross profit\n2,447\n2,144\nResearch and development (R&D)\n385\n369\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A)\n433\n439\nAcquisition charges\n80\n80\nRestructuring charges/other\n1\n4\nOperating profit\n1,548\n1,252\nOther income (expense), net (OI&E)\n28\n21\nInterest and debt expense\n23\n18\nIncome before income taxes\n1,553\n1,255\nProvision for income taxes\n187\n258\nNet income\n$\n1,366\n$\n997\nDiluted earnings per common share\n$\n1.35\n$\n.97\nAverage shares outstanding (millions):\nBasic\n983\n998\nDiluted\n1,005\n1,019\nCash dividends declared per common share\n$\n.62\n$\n.50\nSupplemental Information\n(Quarterly, except as noted)\nProvision for income taxes is based on the following:\nOperating taxes (calculated using the estimated annual effective tax rate)\n$\n316\n$\n382\nDiscrete tax items\n(129)\n(124)\nProvision for income taxes (effective taxes)\n$\n187\n$\n258\nAnnual operating tax rate\n20%\n30%\nEffective tax rate\n12%\n21%\nAs a result of accounting rule ASC 260, which requires a portion of Net income to be allocated to unvested restricted stock units\n(RSUs) on which we pay dividend equivalents, diluted EPS is calculated using the following:\nNet income\n$\n1,366\n$\n997\nIncome allocated to RSUs\n(11)\n(10)\nIncome allocated to common stock for diluted EPS\n$\n1,355\n$\n987\nTEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(Millions of dollars, except share amounts)\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,717\n$\n1,073\nShort-term investments\n2,362\n1,976\nAccounts receivable, net of allowances of ($8) and ($11)\n1,454\n1,337\nRaw materials\n144\n102\nWork in process\n1,076\n1,017\nFinished goods\n812\n724\nInventories\n2,032\n1,843\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n1,025\n811\nTotal current assets\n8,590\n7,040\nProperty, plant and equipment at cost\n4,907\n4,833\nAccumulated depreciation\n(2,171)\n(2,332)\nProperty, plant and equipment\n2,736\n2,501\nLong-term investments\n271\n241\nGoodwill\n4,362\n4,362\nAcquisition-related intangibles\n866\n1,184\nDeferred tax assets\n218\n361\nCapitalized software licenses\n102\n116\nOverfunded retirement plans\n215\n102\nOther long-term assets\n147\n71\nTotal assets\n$\n17,507\n$\n15,978\nLiabilities and stockholders' equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n$\n500\n$\n378\nAccounts payable\n488\n429\nAccrued compensation\n344\n352\nIncome taxes payable\n133\n77\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities\n395\n366\nTotal current liabilities\n1,860\n1,602\nLong-term debt\n3,578\n2,980\nUnderfunded retirement plans\n92\n97\nDeferred tax liabilities\n53\n36\nOther long-term liabilities\n1,282\n624\nTotal liabilities\n6,865\n5,339\nStockholders' equity:\nPreferred stock, $25 par value.

High Volume was about even. Operating profit increased due to higher revenue and associated gross profit.\nEmbedded Processing: (includes Connected Microcontrollers and Processors)\nRevenue increased in both product lines, led by Processors. Operating profit increased primarily due to higher revenue and associated gross profit.\nOther: (includes DLP ® products, calculators and custom ASIC products)\nRevenue decreased by $46 million, and operating profit declined by $23 million.\nNon-GAAP financial information\nThis release includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure. These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with GAAP. Free cash flow was calculated by subtracting Capital expenditures from the most directly comparable GAAP measure, Cash flows from operating activities (also referred to as cash flow from operations).\nWe believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into our financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures.\nReconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in the table below.\nAmounts are in millions of dollars.\nFor 12 Months Ended\nMarch 31,\n2018\n2017\nChange\nCash flow from operations (GAAP)\n$\n5,680\n$\n4,756\n19%\nCapital expenditures\n(757)\n(534)\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP)\n$\n4,923\n$\n4,222\n17%\nRevenue\n$\n15,348\n$\n13,764\nCash flow from operations as a percent of revenue (GAAP)\n37.0%\n34.6%\nFree cash flow as a percent of revenue (non-GAAP)\n32.1%\n30.7%\nThis release also includes references to an annual operating tax rate, a non-GAAP term we use to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate, a GAAP measure that by definition does not include discrete tax items. We believe the term annual operating tax rate more clearly communicates that discrete tax items are excluded from such rate. The term also helps differentiate from the effective tax rate, which includes discrete tax items. No adjustments are made to the estimated annual effective tax rate when using the term annual operating tax rate.\nNotice regarding\nThis release includes intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
