REUTERS/Harrison McClary/File Photo \nThe Grammy-award winning singer, 38, was pictured with her two children, 15-month-old Jameson Moon and Willow Sage, 6, in an issue re-named “The Beautiful Issue,” which included Meghan Markle among more than 70 other female celebrities, and five men. \nThe annual list used to be called “Most Beautiful Woman” but People editor in chief Jess Cagle said it had been renamed “to make clear that the issue is not a beauty contest.” \nIt features “beautiful women (and a few men) of all shapes, sizes and colours, and celebrates the most beautiful qualities of all: strength, humanity and artistry,” Cagle added. \nPink, known for her acrobatic live performances, has scored hits like “What About Us” and “Raise Your Glass” over a 20-year career.
