    "text": "Ryan Braun and Travis Shaw homered on consecutive pitches in the fourth inning as the host Milwaukee Brewers defeated the Miami Marlins 8-0 on Friday night.\nShaw finished 3-for-4 with two RBIs, falling a triple short of the cycle. Needing that triple, Shaw grounded out to second in the eighth inning.\nBraun went 2-for-5 with two RBIs and his fifth homer of the season as Milwaukee won its fourth straight game. Eric Thames went 1-for-3 with a double off the wall and two walks.\nBrewers shortstop Orlando Arcia left the game after the eighth inning due to an apparent right ankle injury, which he suffered trying to get back to first base after a single. Eric Sogard replaced Arcia in the ninth.\nJhoulys Chacin (1-1) pitched his first quality start of the season, allowing just four hits and three walks in six innings, striking out five.\nThames drew an RBI walk in the first inning for the game’s first run. With two outs and no runners on, the Brewers erupted for five runs in the fourth.\nAfter a Lorenzo Cain walk, Milwaukee produced three consecutive run-producing, extra-base hits — all on three consecutive pitches. Former Marlins outfielder Christian Yelich tripled, Braun, a former University of Miami star, hit a two-run homer and Shaw capped the rally with a solo shot.\nMiami rookie Trevor Richards (0-2), who had pitched seven scoreless innings in his previous start, took the loss. He allowed five hits, six walks and six runs (five earned) in 3 2/3 innings. He struck out five as Miami lost its second straight game.\nMilwaukee added two runs in the sixth on a rally that was set up by a Yelich walk and a Braun single, both with no outs. Shaw followed with an RBI single, and Arcia had a two-out run-scoring single.\nThe Brewers closed out the game with solid relief pitching as Dan Jennings (one inning), Taylor Williams (1 1/3 innings) and Oliver Drake (2/3 of an inning) preserved the shutout. Drake inherited a bases-loaded, one-out jam in the ninth and escaped with a strikeout and groundout.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
