Bahrain is a close ally of Britain, the United States and Saudi Arabia. \nLast year, U.S. Navy commanders accused Iran of jeopardizing international navigation by harassing warships passing through the Strait of Hormuz and said future incidents could result in miscalculation and lead to an armed clash. Iran denied the accusations. Reporting by Aziz El Yakoubi and Sarah Dadouch; editing by Andrew Roche",
