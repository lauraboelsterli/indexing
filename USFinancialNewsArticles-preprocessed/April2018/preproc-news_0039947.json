Soccer Football - Premier League - Huddersfield Town vs Watford - John Smith's Stadium, Huddersfield, Britain - April 14, 2018 Huddersfield Town's Tom Ince celebrates scoring their first goal REUTERS/Scott Heppell \nThe hosts had managed only one goal in their previous five matches and were toothless against a Watford side who rarely looked ruffled and who actually created the better chances. \nBut Ince fired home from Mathias Jorgensen’s cut-back as the clock ticked past the 90-minute mark with what was Huddersfield’s only effort on target. \nA huge cheer greeted the final whistle as Huddersfield moved up to 14th place, seven points above the relegation zone. Watford are all but safe in 12th spot. Reporting by Martyn Herman,; Editing by Neville Dalton",
