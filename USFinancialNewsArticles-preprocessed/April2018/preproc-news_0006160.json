    "text": "Matt Chapman homered and Jed Lowrie broke a seventh-inning tie with a two-run double Monday night, lifting the Oakland Athletics to a 3-1 victory over the visiting Texas Rangers in the opener of a four-game series.\nRight-hander Andrew Triggs struck out seven in five innings for the A’s before three relievers combined for shutout ball over the final four innings, allowing Oakland to snap a three-game losing streak.\nVeteran Bartolo Colon also pitched well for the Rangers, giving up Chapman’s third-inning home run but no other runs in his six innings.\nNeither starting pitcher got a decision.\nWith the score tied 1-1, Jonathan Lucroy led off the Athletics’ seventh with a double against Rangers reliever Kevin Jepsen (0-1).\nAfter Marcus Semien drew a two-out walk, Lowrie greeted left-hander Jake Diekman with a double to deep right field, scoring both baserunners for a 3-1 lead.\nAfter Ryan Buchter and Chris Hatcher (2-0) had followed Triggs to the mound with shutout ball, the Rangers put the potential tying run aboard in the ninth when A’s closer Blake Treinen walked pinch hitter Jurickson Profar and allowed a bloop single to Drew Robinson.\nAfter Shin-Soo Choo’s infield out advanced the runners into scoring position, Treinen got Joey Gallo to pop out and Elvis Andrus to ground out for his first save of the season.\nGallo drove in the Rangers’ only run in the fifth with a single that scored Robinson, who had walked and stolen second base.\nTriggs allowed four hits and two walks but just the one run.\nColon likewise left a 1-1 game, having allowed seven hits and one walk. He struck out four.\nChapman, Lucroy and Matt Olson had two hits apiece for Oakland, which out-hit Texas 9-7.\nChoo had two hits for the Rangers, who lost their third straight.\nThe homer by Chapman, his second of the season, and the double by Lucroy were the game’s only extra-base hits.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
