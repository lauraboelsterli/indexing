Strive programs and services are designed to provide high-quality, trauma-informed and client-centered outpatient treatment to help individuals in recovery maintain their life in the “real world” as they rebuild healthy, self-directed lives, reach their full potential, and achieve long-lasting outcomes.\nStrive is setting a new standard of care in the addiction treatment industry by redefining the continuum of care and providing the quality of care normally found in a higher-acuity treatment setting at a cost that is significantly lower. Strive programs allow patients to recover through coordinated, collaborative treatment and recovery resources within the community, making reintegration into the “real world” a primary goal of treatment.\nFurther, Strive programs utilize evidence-based treatment modalities and offer medication-assisted treatment (MAT), such as Vivitrol, to patients as clinically and medically appropriate.\nStrive Health is proud to have developed a network of Centers for Recovery and Community Health united in its mission of providing the highest quality care to individuals and families striving to live healthy, self-directed lives.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180426005450/en/\nFor Strive Health:\nMedia:\nBenjamin Knafo, 914-886-3656\nbknafo@strivecares.com\nor\nEric Frieman\nefrieman@strivecares.com\nor\nWebsite\nwww.strivecares.com\nSource: Strive Health",
