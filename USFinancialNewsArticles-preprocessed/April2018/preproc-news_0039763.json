    "text": "1st Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nNet income of $38.6 million for the current quarter, an increase of $7.3 million, or 23 percent, over the prior year first quarter net income of $31.3 million. Pre-tax income of $47.0 million for the current quarter, an increase of $5.9 million, or 15 percent, over the prior year first quarter pre-tax income of $41.0 million Current quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.48, an increase of 17 percent from the prior year first quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.41. Current quarter organic loan growth of $110.2 million, or 7 percent annualized. Current quarter organic deposit growth of $144 million, or 8 percent annualized, with 20 percent of the increase in non-interest bearing deposits. Dividend declared of $0.23 per share, an increase of $0.02 per share, or 10 percent, over the prior quarter. The dividend was the 132nd consecutive quarterly dividend. The Company completed the acquisition of Columbine Capital Corp., the holding company for Collegiate Peaks Bank, a community bank in Buena Vista, Colorado, with total assets of $551 million. The Company completed the acquisition of Inter-Mountain Bancorp, Inc., the holding company for First Security Bank, a community bank in Bozeman, Montana, with total assets of $1.110 billion. The Company surpassed $10 billion in total assets ending the quarter at $11.659 billion, an increase of $1.952 billion, or 20 percent, from the prior quarter.\nIn addition to the results presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), this press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with information useful in understanding the Company's financial performance, performance trends, and financial position. While the Company uses these non-GAAP measures in its analysis of the Company's performance, this information should not be considered an alternative to measurements required by GAAP.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of certain GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciling item between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures consisted of the one-time net tax expense of $19.7 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017. The one-time net tax expense was driven by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) and the change in the federal marginal rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, which resulted in the revaluation of its deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities (“net deferred tax asset”). The Company believes that the financial results are more comparable excluding the impact of the revaluation of the net deferred tax asset.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures - Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nThree Months ended (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Mar 31,\n2018 Dec 31,\n2017 Mar 31,\n2017 Net income (GAAP) $ 38,559 14,956 31,255 Tax Act adjustment (GAAP) — 19,699 — Net income (non-GAAP) $ 38,559 34,655 31,255 Basic earnings per share (GAAP) $ 0.48 0.19 0.41 Tax Act adjustment (GAAP) — 0.25 — Basic earnings per share (non-GAAP) $ 0.48 0.44 0.41 Diluted earnings per share (GAAP) $ 0.48 0.19 0.41 Tax Act adjustment (GAAP) — 0.25 — Diluted earnings per share (non-GAAP) $ 0.48 0.44 0.41 Return on average assets (annualized) (GAAP) 1.50 % 0.61 % 1.35 % Tax Act adjustment (GAAP) — % 0.81 % — % Return on average assets (annualized) (non-GAAP) 1.50 % 1.42 % 1.35 % Return on average equity (annualized) (GAAP) 11.90 % 4.91 % 11.19 % Tax Act adjustment (GAAP) — % 6.47 % — % Return on average equity (annualized) (non-GAAP) 11.90 % 11.38 % 11.19 % Dividend payout ratio (annualized) (GAAP) 47.92 % 110.53 % 51.22 % Tax Act adjustment (GAAP) — % (62.80 )% — % Dividend payout ratio (annualized) (non-GAAP) 47.92 % 47.73 % 51.22 % Effective tax rate (GAAP) 17.88 % 67.69 % 23.79 % Tax Act adjustment (GAAP) — % (42.57 )% — % Effective tax rate (non-GAAP) 17.88 % 25.12 % 23.79 % Financial Highlights\nAt or for the Three Months ended (Dollars in thousands, except per share and market data) Mar 31,\n2018 Dec 31,\n2017 Mar 31,\n2017 Operating results Net income 1 $ 38,559 34,655 31,255 Basic earnings per share 1 $ 0.48 0.44 0.41 Diluted earnings per share 1 $ 0.48 0.44 0.41 Dividends declared per share $ 0.23 0.21 0.21 Market value per share Closing $ 38.38 39.39 33.93 High $ 41.24 41.23 38.17 Low $ 36.72 35.50 31.70 Selected ratios and other data Number of common stock shares outstanding 84,511,472 78,006,956 76,619,952 Average outstanding shares - basic 80,808,904 78,006,956 76,572,116 Average outstanding shares - diluted 80,887,135 78,094,494 76,633,283 Return on average assets (annualized) 1 1.50 % 1.42 % 1.35 % Return on average equity (annualized) 1 11.90 % 11.38 % 11.19 % Efficiency ratio 57.80 % 54.02 % 55.57 % Dividend payout ratio 1 47.92 % 47.73 % 51.22 % Loan to deposit ratio 81.83 % 87.29 % 78.91 % Number of full time equivalent employees 2,492 2,278 2,224 Number of locations 166 145 142 Number of ATMs 222 200 195\n1 Excludes a one-time revaluation of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Act for the three months ended December 31, 2017.

(NASDAQ:GBCI) reported net income of $38.6 million for the current quarter, an increase of $7.3 million, or 23 percent, from the $31.3 million of net income for the prior year first quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the current quarter was $0.48 per share, an increase of $0.07, or 17 percent, from the prior year first quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.41. Included in the current quarter was $1.8 million of acquisition-related expenses. “I am very pleased to see the Glacier team post solid gains across all of our Company’s key performance metrics. This was accomplished during one of the busiest quarters in the Company’s history, closing two of our largest acquisitions while continuing to grow our core business,” said Randy Chesler, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nOn February 28, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Inter-Mountain Bancorp, Inc., the holding company for First Security Bank, a community bank in Bozeman, Montana (collectively, “FSB”). On January 31, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Columbine Capital Corp., the holding company for Collegiate Peaks Bank, a community bank in Buena Vista, Colorado (collectively, “Collegiate”). The Company’s results of operations and financial condition include the acquisitions beginning on the acquisition dates and the following table discloses the preliminary fair value estimates of selected classifications of assets and liabilities acquired:\nFSB Collegiate (Dollars in thousands) February 28,\n2018 January 31,\n2018 Total Total assets $ 1,109,684 551,198 1,660,882 Debt securities 271,865 42,177 314,042 Loans receivable 627,767 354,252 982,019 Non-interest bearing deposits 301,468 170,022 471,490 Interest bearing deposits 576,118 267,149 843,267 Borrowings 36,880 12,509 49,389 Asset Summary\n$ Change from (Dollars in thousands) Mar 31,\n2018 Dec 31,\n2017 Mar 31,\n2017 Dec 31,\n2017 Mar 31,\n2017 Cash and cash equivalents $ 451,048 200,004 234,004 251,044 217,044 Debt securities, available-for-sale 2,154,845 1,778,243 2,314,521 376,602 (159,676 ) Debt securities, held-to-maturity 634,413 648,313 667,388 (13,900 ) (32,975 ) Total debt securities 2,789,258 2,426,556 2,981,909 362,702 (192,651 ) Loans receivable Residential real estate 831,021 720,728 685,458 110,293 145,563 Commercial real estate 4,251,003 3,577,139 3,056,372 673,864 1,194,631 Other commercial 1,839,293 1,579,353 1,462,110 259,940 377,183 Home equity 489,879 457,918 433,554 31,961 56,325 Other consumer 258,834 242,686 239,480 16,148 19,354 Loans receivable 7,670,030 6,577,824 5,876,974 1,092,206 1,793,056 Allowance for loan and lease losses (127,608 ) (129,568 ) (129,226 ) 1,960 1,618 Loans receivable, net 7,542,422 6,448,256 5,747,748 1,094,166 1,794,674 Other assets 876,050 631,533 590,247 244,517 285,803 Total assets $ 11,658,778 9,706,349 9,553,908 1,952,429 2,104,870 The Company successfully executed its strategy to stay below $10 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2017 to delay the impact of the Durbin Amendment for one additional year. The Durbin Amendment, which was passed as part of Dodd-Frank, establishes limits on the amount of interchange fees that can be charged to merchants for debit card processing and will reduce the Company’s service charge fee income in the future. As a result, the Company’s annual service charge fee income is expected to decline by approximately $14 - $16 million (pre-tax) beginning July 2019. During the current quarter, the Company surpassed $10 billion in total assets ending the quarter at $11.659 billion, which was an increase of $1.952 billion, or 20 percent, from the prior quarter resulting from the current quarter acquisitions along with organic growth in loans and debt securities.\nTotal debt securities of $2.789 billion at March 31, 2018 increased $363 million, or 15 percent, during the current quarter and decreased $192.7 million, or 6 percent, from the prior year first quarter. The current quarter increase was primarily due to the addition of the acquired banks. Debt securities represented 24 percent of total assets at March 31, 2018 compared to 31 percent of total assets at March 31, 2017.\nThe loan portfolio increased $110 million, or 7 percent annualized, during the current quarter, excluding the FSB and Collegiate acquisitions. The loan category with the largest increase was commercial real estate loans which increased $56.0 million, or 2 percent. Excluding the current quarter acquisitions and the prior year acquisition of Foothills Bank (“Foothills”), the loan portfolio increased $519 million, or 9 percent, since March 31, 2017 and was primarily driven by growth in commercial real estate loans, which increased $346 million, or 11 percent.\nCredit Quality Summary\nAt or for the\nThree Months\nended At or for the\nYear ended At or for the\nThree Months\nended (Dollars in thousands) Mar 31,\n2018 Dec 31,\n2017 Mar 31,\n2017 Allowance for loan and lease losses Balance at beginning of period $ 129,568 129,572 129,572 Provision for loan losses 795 10,824 1,598 Charge-offs (5,007 ) (19,331 ) (4,229 ) Recoveries 2,252 8,503 2,285 Balance at end of period $ 127,608 129,568 129,226 Other real estate owned $ 14,132 14,269 17,771 Accruing loans 90 days or more past due 5,402 6,077 3,028 Non-accrual loans 54,449 44,833 50,674 Total non-performing assets $ 73,983 65,179 71,473 Non-performing assets as a percentage of subsidiary assets 0.64 % 0.68 % 0.75 % Allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of non-performing loans 213 % 255 % 241 % Allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans 1.66 % 1.97 % 2.20 % Net charge-offs as a percentage of total loans 0.04 % 0.17 % 0.03 % Accruing loans 30-89 days past due $ 44,963 37,687 39,160 Accruing troubled debt restructurings $ 41,649 38,491 38,955 Non-accrual troubled debt restructurings $ 13,289 23,709 19,479 U.S. government guarantees included in non-performing assets $ 4,548 2,513 1,690 Non-performing assets at March 31, 2018 were $74.0 million, an increase of $8.8 million, or 14 percent, from December 31, 2017. Non-performing assets as a percentage of subsidiary assets at March 31, 2018 was 0.64 percent which was a decrease of 4 basis points from the prior year end of 0.68 percent and a decrease of 11 basis points from prior year first quarter. Early stage delinquencies (accruing loans 30-89 days past due) of $45.0 million at March 31, 2018 increased $7.3 million from the prior quarter and increased $5.8 million from the prior year which was also attributable to the acquired banks. Early stage delinquencies as a percentage of loans at March 31, 2018 was 0.59 percent which was an increase of 2 basis points from the prior year end and a decrease of 8 basis points from prior year first quarter. The allowance for loan and lease losses (“allowance”) as a percent of total loans outstanding at March 31, 2018 was 1.66 percent, a decrease of 31 basis points from 1.97 percent at December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily driven by the addition of loans from new acquisitions, as they are added to the portfolio on a fair value basis and as a result do not require an allowance.\nCredit Quality Trends and Provision for Loan Losses\n(Dollars in thousands) Provision\nfor Loan\nLosses Net\nCharge-Offs\n(Recoveries) ALLL\nas a Percent\nof Loans Accruing\nLoans 30-89\nDays Past Due\nas a Percent of\nLoans Non-Performing\nAssets to\nTotal Subsidiary\nAssets First quarter 2018 $ 795 $ 2,755 1.66 % 0.59 % 0.64 % Fourth quarter 2017 2,886 2,894 1.97 % 0.57 % 0.68 % Third quarter 2017 3,327 3,628 1.99 % 0.45 % 0.67 % Second quarter 2017 3,013 2,362 2.05 % 0.49 % 0.70 % First quarter 2017 1,598 1,944 2.20 % 0.67 % 0.75 % Fourth quarter 2016 1,139 4,101 2.28 % 0.45 % 0.76 % Third quarter 2016 626 478 2.37 % 0.49 % 0.84 % Second quarter 2016 — (2,315 ) 2.46 % 0.44 % 0.82 % Net charge-offs for the current quarter were $2.8 million compared to $2.9 million for the prior quarter and $1.9 million from the same quarter last year.

Excluding the acquisitions and deposits moved back onto the balance sheet, core deposits increased $143 million, or 2 percent, from the prior quarter. Excluding acquisitions, core deposit increased $523 million, or 7 percent, from the prior year first quarter. Excluding acquisitions, non-interest bearing deposits increased $28.1 million, or 1 percent, from prior quarter and increased $193 million, or 9 percent, from the prior year.\nSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase (“repurchase agreements”) of $396 million at March 31, 2018 increased $33.2 million, or 9 percent, from the prior quarter and decreased $101 million, or 20 percent, from the prior year first quarter. Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances of $155 million at March 31, 2018, decreased $199 million over prior quarter as that higher cost of funding was replaced with the deposits brought back onto the balance sheet.\nStockholders’ Equity Summary\n$ Change from (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Mar 31,\n2018 Dec 31,\n2017 Mar 31,\n2017 Dec 31,\n2017 Mar 31,\n2017 Common equity $ 1,471,047 1,201,036 1,139,652 270,011 331,395 Accumulated other comprehensive loss (17,023 ) (1,979 ) (4,412 ) (15,044 ) (12,611 ) Total stockholders’ equity 1,454,024 1,199,057 1,135,240 254,967 318,784 Goodwill and core deposit intangible, net (343,991 ) (191,995 ) (158,799 ) (151,996 ) (185,192 ) Tangible stockholders’ equity $ 1,110,033 1,007,062 976,441 102,971 133,592 Stockholders’ equity to total assets 12.47 % 12.35 % 11.88 % Tangible stockholders’ equity to total tangible assets 9.81 % 10.58 % 10.39 % Book value per common share $ 17.21 15.37 14.82 1.84 2.39 Tangible book value per common share $ 13.13 12.91 12.74 0.22 0.39 Tangible stockholders’ equity of $1.110 billion at March 31, 2018 increased $103 million compared to the prior quarter which was the result of earnings retention, $181 million and $69.8 million of Company stock issued for the acquisitions of FSB and Collegiate, respectively; these increases more than offset the increase in goodwill and core deposit intangibles associated with the acquisitions. Tangible book value per common share at quarter end increased $0.22 per share from the prior quarter and increased $0.39 per share from a year ago.\nCash Dividend\nOn March 28, 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share, an increase of $0.02 per share, or 10 percent from the prior quarter.

Interest income on commercial loans increased $4.2 million, or 7 percent, from the prior quarter and increased $15.5 million, or 31 percent, from the prior year first quarter.\nThe current quarter interest expense of $7.8 million increased $702 thousand, or 10 percent, from the prior quarter and increased $408 thousand, or 6 percent, from the prior year first quarter. The total cost of funding (including non-interest bearing deposits) for the current quarter was 35 basis points compared to 33 basis points for the prior quarter and 37 basis points for the prior year first quarter. The 2 basis points increase from the prior quarter was driven by the $395 million of higher cost deposits brought back onto the balance sheet during the current quarter.\nThe Company’s net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets, on a tax-equivalent basis, for the current quarter was 4.10 percent compared to 4.23 percent in the prior quarter. The 13 basis points decrease in the net interest margin was primarily the result of a 15 basis points decrease in the tax benefit related to the tax effect on certain earning assets as a result of the lower federal income tax rate in the current year. The current quarter net interest margin increased 7 basis points over the prior year first quarter net interest margin of 4.03 percent even though there was a current quarter decrease of 15 basis points driven by the decrease in the federal income tax rate. The increase in the core margin from the prior year first quarter resulted from the remix of earning assets to higher yielding loans and stable funding costs. “The low cost core deposit funding base of Collegiate Peaks Bank and First Security Bank adds significant value to the Company, especially in higher interest rate environments,” said Ron Copher, Chief Financial Officer.\nNon-interest Income\nNon-interest income for the current quarter totaled $26.1 million, a decrease of $1.6 million, or 6 percent, from the prior quarter and an increase of $397 thousand, or 2 percent, over the same quarter last year. Service charges and other fees of $16.9 million, increased $1.2 million, or 8 percent, from the prior year first quarter primarily due to the increased number of accounts. Gain on sale of loans decreased $1.3 million, or 18 percent, from the prior quarter and decreased $261 thousand from the prior year first quarter as a result of decreased refinance and purchase activity. Other income of $2.0 million, decreased $844 thousand, or 30 percent, from the prior year first quarter due to the decrease in gain on sale of other real estate owned (“OREO”). Gain on sale of OREO during the first quarter of 2018 was $72.7 thousand compared to $967 thousand in the prior year first quarter.\nNon-interest Expense Summary\nThree Months ended $ Change from (Dollars in thousands) Mar 31,\n2018 Dec 31,\n2017 Mar 31,\n2017 Dec 31,\n2017 Mar 31,\n2017 Compensation and employee benefits $ 45,721 40,465 39,246 5,256 6,475 Occupancy and equipment 7,274 6,925 6,646 349 628 Advertising and promotions 2,170 2,024 1,973 146 197 Data processing 3,967 3,970 3,124 (3 ) 843 Other real estate owned 72 377 273 (305 ) (201 ) Regulatory assessments and insurance 1,206 1,069 1,061 137 145 Core deposit intangibles amortization 1,056 614 601 442 455 Other expenses 12,161 12,922 10,420 (761 ) 1,741 Total non-interest expense $ 73,627 68,366 63,344 5,261 10,283 Compensation and employee benefits increased by $5.3 million, or 13 percent, from the prior year fourth quarter due to annual salary increases and the increased number of employees from acquisitions. Occupancy and equipment expense increased $349 thousand, or 5 percent, over the prior quarter and increased $628 thousand, or 9 percent, over the prior year first quarter and was attributable to the acquisitions. Data processing expense increased $843 thousand, or 27 percent, from the prior year first quarter as a result of acquisitions and volume driven cost increases. Other expenses increased $1.7 million, or 17 percent from the prior year first quarter primarily from an increase in acquisition related expenses from the two acquisitions during the current quarter. Acquisition related expenses were $1.8 million during the current quarter compared to $936 thousand in the prior quarter and $83 thousand in the prior year first quarter.\nFederal and State Income Tax Expense\nTax expense during the first quarter of 2018 was $8.4 million, which is a decrease of $1.4 million, or 14 percent, from the prior year first quarter and was attributable to the decrease in the federal income tax rate driven by the Tax Act. The effective tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 was 18 percent compared to 24 percent in the prior year first quarter. Tax expense decreased $22.9 million from the prior quarter due to the one-time $19.7 million revaluation of the Company’s net deferred tax asset and a decrease in the federal income tax rate in the current year. Excluding the impact of the revaluation of the deferred tax asset, the effective federal and state income tax rate for the Company was 25 percent in the prior quarter.\nEfficiency Ratio\nThe current quarter efficiency ratio was 57.8 percent, a 378 basis points increase from the prior quarter efficiency ratio of 54.02 percent. The increase included 230 basis points related to the combined impact of the decrease in the federal income tax rate and the increase in acquisition related expenses.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release may contain the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
