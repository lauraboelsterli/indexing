Markets in Australia, Hong Kong, Britain and Germany remained shut on Monday while the U.S. market will resume trading. \nThe broader Topix dropped 0.4 percent to 1,708.78, with only 957 million shares changing hands, the lowest level since late December. Turnover was only 1.674 trillion yen, also the lowest since then. \nReal estate shares lost ground with Mitsui Fudosan falling 2.0 percent and Mitsubishi Estate shedding 1.6 percent. \nBanking stocks were sold as well. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group shed 0.8 percent and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group declined 1.0 percent. \nThe utility sector rose, led by Kansai Electric Power Co’s surge of 5.5 percent after the Osaka District Court rejected an injunction on Friday seeking to halt two reactors at the Takahama nuclear plant.
