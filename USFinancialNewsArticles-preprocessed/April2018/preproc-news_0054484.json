He was a recent widower with two sons and a daughter and was nearly twice Cooke’s age.\nShe renounced her American citizenship after the marriage and Namgyal later ceased to be king after the region was absorbed as a state of India in 1975. SONJA HARALDSEN AND NORWAY’S CROWN PRINCE HARALD\nSonja Haraldsen dated then-Crown Prince Harald of Norway for years before he told his father King Olav V he would never marry anyone but her, putting the throne in jeopardy as Harald was the sole heir.\nThey wed on Aug. 29, 1968, after King Olaf consulted the government and allowed the engagement.
