Invested $631 million of capital in the first quarter. Returned $665 million in cash to stockholders through dividends and stock buybacks.\nSAN ANTONIO, April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Valero Energy Corporation (NYSE:VLO) (“Valero”) today reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders of $469 million, or $1.09 per share, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $305 million, or $0.68 per share, for the first quarter of 2017. Excluding the special items reflected in the accompanying earnings release tables, first quarter 2018 adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders was $431 million, or $1.00 per share, an increase of 47 percent in adjusted per share results compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nRefining\nThe refining segment reported $922 million of operating income for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $640 million for the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2018 operating income includes a $170 million benefit from the Blender’s Tax Credit and $10 million of expenses primarily related to ongoing repairs at certain of the company’s refineries to address damage resulting from Hurricane Harvey in 2017 and other inclement weather conditions that occurred in the first quarter of 2018. Excluding these special items, operating income was $762 million, an increase of $122 million versus first quarter 2017 driven primarily by higher distillate margins, partly offset by narrower discounts for medium and heavy sour crude oils versus Brent.\nRefinery throughput capacity utilization was 94 percent, and throughput volumes averaged 2.9 million barrels per day in the first quarter of 2018, which is 93,000 barrels per day higher than the first quarter of 2017. The company exported a total of 271,000 barrels per day of gasoline and distillate during the first quarter of 2018.\nBiofuel blending costs were $206 million in the first quarter of 2018, which is $60 million greater than in the first quarter of 2017, mainly due to higher Renewable Identification Number (RIN) prices.\n“We delivered solid results despite a relatively soft first quarter, and we remain optimistic on fundamentals for the balance of the year,” said Joe Gorder, Valero Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our refineries are well-situated to take advantage of discounted heavy sour and domestic sweet crude oils versus Brent and to meet the growing demand for refined products in Latin America.”\nEthanol\nThe ethanol segment reported $45 million of operating income for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $22 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in operating income is attributed primarily to higher distillers grain prices. Ethanol production volumes of 4.1 million gallons per day were in line with the first quarter of 2017.\nVLP\nThe VLP segment, which is composed of Valero Energy Partners LP (the \"Partnership\"), the company’s majority-owned midstream master limited partnership, reported $84 million of operating income for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $70 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in operating income is mostly driven by contributions from the Port Arthur terminal assets and Parkway Pipeline, which the Partnership acquired from Valero in November 2017. These assets were formerly a part of the refining segment.\nCorporate and Other\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $238 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $192 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in general and administrative expenses is mainly due to adjustments to our environmental liabilities. Excluding the benefit related to the retroactive Blender’s Tax Credit, the effective tax rate was 22 percent for the first quarter of 2018.\nInvesting and Financing Activities\nCapital investments in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $631 million. Included in this amount is $448 million associated with sustaining the business, such as turnaround, catalyst, and regulatory compliance expenditures, with the balance for growth.\nValero returned $665 million to stockholders in the first quarter, of which $345 million was paid as dividends and the balance was used to purchase 3.5 million shares of its common stock, resulting in a total payout ratio of 57 percent. Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter was $138 million. Included in this amount is a $1.1 billion use of cash to fund working capital. Excluding working capital, adjusted net cash provided by operating activities was $1.2 billion.\nThe company continues to target a total payout ratio between 40 and 50 percent of adjusted net cash provided by operating activities for 2018. Valero defines total payout ratio as the sum of dividends and stock buybacks divided by adjusted net cash provided by operating activities.\nLiquidity and Financial Position\nValero ended the first quarter of 2018 with $9.0 billion of total debt and $4.7 billion of cash and temporary cash investments. The debt to capital ratio, net of $2.0 billion in cash, was 24 percent.\nStrategic Update\nThe company continued to execute its strategy to invest in logistics assets, increase margin capture, and reduce secondary costs. Diamond Pipeline throughput increased in the first quarter, providing the Memphis refinery with additional access to cost-advantaged crude oil grades in Cushing, Oklahoma. Also during the quarter, the company acquired the SemLogistics Milford Haven fuels storage facility in Wales and entered into a joint ownership agreement with Sunrise Pipeline LLC, a subsidiary of Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (“Plains”), which will give Valero undivided ownership of 100,000 barrels per day of capacity in a pipeline that will connect Midland and Wichita Falls, Texas. Plains will construct and operate the pipeline, the completion of which is scheduled in the first quarter of 2019. Both investments enhance supply flexibility for Valero’s refineries in the United Kingdom and the U.S. Mid-Continent region of the United States, respectively.\n“We’re seeing benefits from our Diamond Pipeline investment today, and we look forward to having greater access to Permian Basin crude oils for our U.S. Mid-Continent refineries upon completion of the Sunrise Pipeline expansion next year,” said Gorder.\nConstruction is progressing on the previously announced Diamond Green Diesel capacity expansion, the Houston and St. Charles alkylation units, the Central Texas pipelines and terminals, and the Pasadena products terminal. These projects remain on track for completion as scheduled.\nAdditionally, Valero’s Board of Directors approved the construction of a 45 megawatt cogeneration plant at the Pembroke refinery, which is expected to lower its operating expenses and improve supply reliability for power and steam. The $170 million project is expected to be completed in 2020.\nThe company’s capital investment plans for 2018 remain at $2.7 billion, of which $1.0 billion is for growth projects and $1.7 billion is for sustaining the business.\nConference Call\nValero’s senior management will hold a conference call at 10 a.m. ET today to discuss this earnings release and to provide an update on operations and strategy.\nAbout Valero\nValero Energy Corporation, through its subsidiaries, is an international manufacturer and marketer of transportation fuels and other petrochemical products.

RELEASE TABLES\n(a) Cost of materials and other for the three months ended March 31, 2018 includes a benefit of $170 million for the biodiesel blender’s tax credit attributable to volumes blended during 2017. The benefit was recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2018 because the legislation authorizing the credit was passed and signed into law in February 2018. The $170 million pre-tax benefit is included in the refining segment and includes $80 million attributable to noncontrolling interest and $90 million attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders.\n(b) Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update 2017-07, “Compensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715),” which resulted in the reclassification of the non-service component of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost from operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) and general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) to “other income, net.” These new provisions are required to be applied retrospectively. Accordingly, for the three months ended March 31, 2017, we reclassified the non-service component out of operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) and general and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) of $7 million and $2 million, respectively, and into “other income, net.”\n(c) Other operating expenses reflects expenses that are not associated with our cost of sales. Other operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2018 primarily includes repair costs incurred at certain of our refineries due to damage associated with inclement weather events in 2018 and Hurricane Harvey in 2017.\n(d) General and administrative expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 includes a charge of $52 million for an environmental reserve adjustment associated with certain non-operating sites.\n(e) As a result of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 enacted on December 22, 2017, the U.S. statutory income tax rate was reduced from 35 percent to 21 percent. Therefore, earnings from our U.S. operations for the three months ended March 31, 2018 are now taxed at 21 percent, resulting in a lower effective tax rate compared to the three months ended March 31, 2017.\n(f) We use certain financial measures (as noted below) in the earnings release tables and accompanying earnings release that are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are considered to be non-GAAP measures.\nWe have defined these non-GAAP measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements, including industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies. We believe these measures are useful to assess our ongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures, they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under U.S. GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently, which diminishes their utility.\nNon-GAAP measures are as follows:\nAdjusted net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders is defined as net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders excluding the blender’s tax credit, the environmental reserve adjustment, and their related income tax effect. Because the blender’s tax credit is attributable to volumes blended during 2017 and is not related to 2018 activities (see note (a)) and the environmental reserve adjustment is attributable to sites that were shutdown by prior owners and subsequently acquired by us (referred to by us as non-operating sites) (see note (d)), we believe that these items are not indicative of our core operating performance in 2018 and that their exclusion results in an important measure for our ongoing financial performance to better assess our underlying business results and trends. Adjusted earnings per common share – assuming dilution is defined as adjusted net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders divided by the number of weighted- in the applicable period, assuming dilution. Refining margin is defined as refining operating income excluding the blender’s tax credit, operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense), other operating expenses, and depreciation and amortization expense. We believe refining margin is an important measure of our refining segment’s operating and financial performance as it is the most comparable measure to the industry’s market reference product margins, which are used by industry analysts, investors, and others to evaluate our performance. Ethanol margin is defined as ethanol operating income excluding operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization expense) and depreciation and amortization expense. We believe ethanol margin is an important measure of our ethanol segment’s operating and financial performance as it is the most comparable measure to the industry’s market reference product margins, which are used by industry analysts, investors, and others to evaluate our performance. Adjusted refining operating income is defined as refining segment operating income excluding the 2017 blender’s tax credit received in 2018 (see note (a)) and other operating expenses. We believe adjusted refining operating income is an important measure of our refining segment’s operating and financial performance because it excludes items that are not indicative of that segment’s core operating performance.\n(g) The refining segment regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: U.S. Gulf Coast - Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Houston, Meraux, Port Arthur, St. Charles, Texas City, and Three Rivers Refineries; U.S. Mid-Continent - Ardmore, McKee, and Memphis Refineries; North Atlantic - Pembroke and Quebec City Refineries; and U.S. West Coast - Benicia and Wilmington Refineries.\n(h) Primarily includes petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, sulfur, and asphalt.\n(i) Valero uses certain operating statistics (as noted below) in the earnings release tables and the accompanying earnings release to evaluate performance between comparable periods. Different companies may calculate them in different ways.\nAll per barrel of throughput and per gallon of production amounts are calculated by dividing the associated dollar amount by the throughput volumes, production volumes, pipeline transportation throughput volumes, or terminaling throughput volumes for the period, as applicable.\nThroughput volumes, production volumes, pipeline transportation throughput volumes, and terminaling throughput volumes are calculated by multiplying throughput volumes per day, production volumes per day, pipeline transportation throughput volumes per day, and terminaling throughput volumes per day (as provided in the accompanying tables), respectively, by the number of days in the applicable period.\nSource:Valero Energy Corporation",
