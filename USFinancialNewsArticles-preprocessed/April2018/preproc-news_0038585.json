Volatility of rupee and a tepid outlook forecast from Infosys Ltd is weighing on IT stocks.”\nITC Ltd, India’s biggest cigarette maker which also sells biscuits under the Sunfeast brand, was the top contributor on both the indexes and was on track to gain for a third straight session.\nConsumer staples stocks such as Dabur India Ltd rose as much as 2.8 percent to hit a near 11-week high, while Hindustan Unilever Ltd hit an all-time high.\nMedia stocks also gained with Nifty media index up 1.5 percent. Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd rose as much as 3.3 percent to hit a 3-week high of 594.9 rupees.\nHowever, information technology stocks continued to be under selling pressure following Infosys March quarter results on Friday.\nMeanwhile, shares of cement maker ACC Ltd and IT firm Mindtree Ltd were trading largely unchanged ahead of their quarterly results due later in the day.\nReporting by Vishal Sridhar and Gaurav Dogra in Bengaluru; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri\n ",
