    "text": "CHEYENNE, Wyo., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- MedX Holdings, Inc. (OTC Pink:MEDH) has completed the licensing and lease agreements to a Humboldt County, CA marijuana grow operation. In order to remain compliant with federal restrictions on cannabis, MedX has purchased the rights to a genetic strain of cannabis as a propriety technology from Viridian Resources. MedX Holdings is licensing the right to use this proprietary strain exclusively to the Humboldt grower. MedX will in turn receive an 85% royalty on every pound produced of our proprietary strain of cannabis. All of the managerial duties and farming applications are controlled by the lease holder, who has been a Master Grower for 22 years. The Master Grower will be using the proprietary strain on 250 plants, which can conservatively yield 2 to 5 lbs. of product per plant in a single season, and can be done in phases for scheduled and controlled harvesting. The Grower’s yielded product can then be sold to the distribution centers and dispensaries at an average weighted price of $1,350.00 to $2,000.00 USD per pound. At the Master Grower’s request for financing, MedX Holdings has allocated cash and capital from other businesses to assist in the cost of operations, and we have estimated that the Grower’s financing will be roughly $75,000.00 to $100,000.00 USD for the season.\nViridian Resources has proven themselves as a valuable consultant to MedX Holdings, Inc. Through Viridian Resources, several projects in real estate, marijuana grow operations, and marketable ancillary products have been brought to our attention. The Company feels that these opportunities would have gone unseen without the assistance of Viridian Resources. MedX Holdings, Inc. has entered into discussions with the managing partners to acquire Viridian Resources as a wholly owned subsidiary, which would include all proprietary designs, products, and network connections in the legalized marijuana industry.\n“This is yet another stepping stone to bringing real assets and revenues into MedX Holdings. These types of prospects are rare, and the revenue potentials exceed 1,100% return on investment,” Mark Miller, CEO exclaimed. “Without Viridian and our trip to California, none of this would have been possible, and we think that their business model would work well under the MedX Holdings umbrella.”\nFollow us on Twitter @MedX_Holdings\nABOUT: MedX Holdings\nMedX Holdings acquires businesses throughout the United States that have operational track records, including the expansion of its current operations in residential/commercial construction and real estate.\nSafe-Harbor Statement under the Private 1995: This press release may contain forward-looking information within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), including all statements that are not statements of historical fact regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of the company, its directors or its officers with respect to, among other things: (i) the company's financing plans; (ii) trends affecting the company's financial condition or results of operations; (iii) the company's growth strategy and operating strategy; and (iv) the declaration and payment of dividends.
