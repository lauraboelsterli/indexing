This compares to net income of $16.9 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. On March 1, 2018, the Company closed on the acquisition of Pinnacle Homes, a homebuilder in the greater Detroit, Michigan market. Expenses of $2.6 million (including $0.9 million in housing cost of sales for purchase accounting adjustments) related to this transaction were included in our first quarter results.\nNew contracts for the first quarter reached an all-time quarterly record of 1,739, increasing 20% from the 1,454 contracts recorded in 2017's first quarter. Homes delivered in 2018's first quarter increased 8% to a first quarter record of 1,122. This compares to 1,038 homes delivered in 2017's first quarter. Homes in backlog at March 31, 2018 had a first quarter record total sales value of $1.1 billion, a 31% increase over a year ago, with backlog units increasing 24% to 2,744 and an average sales price of $398,000.

The Company's cancellation rate was 12% in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 14% in 2017's first quarter.\nRobert H. Schottenstein, Chief Executive Officer and President, commented, \"We had a strong first quarter highlighted by record new contracts of 1,739 - a 20% increase from last year's first quarter, and first quarter records in homes delivered and revenue. We also achieved record first quarter backlog, with sales value of $1.1 billion - a 31% increase over 2017's first quarter, and our units in backlog increased by 24%. Our overhead expense ratio improved 30 basis points and diluted earnings per share improved 9% from 2017's first quarter.\"\nMr. Schottenstein continued, \"We are off to a very solid start in 2018. On March 1, we successfully closed on the acquisition of Detroit-based Pinnacle Homes, strengthening and expanding our geographic footprint. Our financial condition remains strong. We ended the quarter with shareholders' equity of $786 million and a homebuilding debt to capital ratio of 48%. Looking ahead, with our record first quarter backlog, planned new community openings and steady housing market conditions, we are poised to have a solid 2018. We will continue to focus on increasing profitability, growing our market share, and investing in attractive land opportunities.\"\nThe Company will broadcast live its earnings conference call today at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time.
