FILE PHOTO - China Huarong Asset Management Co Chairman Lai Xiaomin listens to a question from a reporter during the debut of the company at the Hong Kong Exchanges in Hong Kong, China October 30, 2015. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo \nThe Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said late on Tuesday it was investigating Huarong Chairman Lai Xiaomin for suspected “serious discipline violations”, a euphemism for graft, making him the latest in a string of high-profile financial executives targeted. \nShares of China Huarong Asset Management, which has a market value of HK$124 billion ($15.8 billion), Huarong Investment Stock Corp Ltd ( 2277.HK ) and Huarong International Financial Holdings Ltd ( 0993.HK ), were halted pending statements, the companies said in statements to the stock exchange. \nThey gave no further details. Huarong Asset Management declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. Reporting by Donny Kwok; Editing by Anne Marie Roantree and Himani Sarkar",
