    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Three Air France pilots’ unions called on Sunday for a new round of strikes on April 10-11 after a wave already planned for April 3 and 7.\nThe SNPL, SPAF and Alter unions said in a statement they were planning the new strike after management refused to consider their requests for higher wages in recent talks.\nAir France management has said that the unions’ demands for a six percent wage increase could jeopardize its growth plans. The airline was hit by a series of strikes in March.\nReporting by Leigh Thomas; Editing by Andrew Roche\n ",
