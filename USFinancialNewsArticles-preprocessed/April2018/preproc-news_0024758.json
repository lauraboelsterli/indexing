    "text": "April 13, 2018 / 5:40 AM / in 2 hours China starts vetting applications for new QDII quotas - sources Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nSHANGHAI, April 13 (Reuters) - China’s foreign exchange regulator has resumed vetting quota applications under the Qualified Domestic Institution Investor (QDII) scheme, two industry sources said, signaling a resumption of the outbound investment scheme after a three-year hiatus. \nChina unofficially suspended QDII in 2015 when gyrations in Chinese stock and currency markets prompted capital flight. Over the past year, Chinese equities have steadied while the yuan has gained sharply against the U.S. dollar. \nThe State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) on Wednesday held a meeting with major financial institutions, including banks, insurers and mutual fund houses, inviting them to submit applications for QDII quotas, said the two sources with direct knowledge of the meeting. \nThe meeting was first reported on Thursday by the official Securities Times. \nOne source, at a major state-owned insurance company, expected new quotas to be granted as early as this month, while the other source, at a mutual fund house, declined to forecast a timetable. \nThe quota each institution will be granted will be tied to the size of its domestic assets under management, as well as its overseas investment capabilities, a source said. \nSAFE did not have an immediate response to faxed questions. \nThe QDII resumption comes amid a broader deregulation of China’s financial sector. President Xi Jinping vowed earlier this week to open Chinese markets further, easing fears of a full-blown trade war between Beijing and Washington. \nThe QDII scheme was created in 2006 to allow domestic investors to put money into overseas financial markets. About $90 billion in investment quotas have been issued so far to China’s financial institutions. \nEarlier this year, China resumed Qualified Domestic Limited Partnership (QDLP), another outbound investment scheme.
