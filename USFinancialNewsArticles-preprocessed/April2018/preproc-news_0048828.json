    "text": "Billionaire investor Carl Icahn said Tuesday that he hasn't spoken with President Donald Trump for several months.\nIn a letter to The Washington Post , Icahn wrote he was concerned about the outlet's characterization of his relationship with the president in a recent article.\n\"The article seemed to imply that I've been speaking regularly with the president,\" he explained. \"I'd like to set the record straight: Neither I nor anyone in my office has spoken with the president or any high-level member of the Trump administration, including Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt, regarding government business since August.\"\nIcahn resigned from his post as special advisor on regulation to Trump last year, ahead of a critical New Yorker magazine article describing his potential conflicts of interest.\nFor his part, Icahn reiterated that his White House departure stemmed from his distaste for partisan backbiting.\n\"While I agree with many of the things [Trump's] administration has done, I do disagree with others,\" he wrote. \"I simply found the constant drumbeat of vitriol and rhetoric in Washington — on both sides of the aisle — to be distasteful and a distraction from my busy schedule.\"\n\"Washington is not for me,\" Icahn added.\nRead Icahn's full letter to The Washington Post here.\n",
