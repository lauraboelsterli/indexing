    "text": "0 COMMENTS Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is leading the company past the Windows era.\nEvery week, CIO Journal offers a glimpse into the mind of the CEO, whose view of technology is shaped by stories in management journals, general interest magazines and, of course, in-flight publications.\nMining the innovator’s dilemma for digital survival. Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella talked with McKinsey & Co.’s Simon London about surfing disruption by reframing the business. Companies need to broaden the definition of the market they serve and can’t just define themselves by the technology they are using, said Mr. Nadella, who recently led a major reorganization at the company, downgrading Windows. Imagine a railroad company in the 1930s seeing itself as working in transportation and not just in railroads, he suggests. “Then it probably would have seen the ability to line extend or jump into new businesses… That’s why I like to talk about a perpetual or a perennial category we are in: the modern workplace. My bet is that the workplace will always remain, and you will always need to be modern.”\nTapping hunger for higher productivity. Businessweek reports on several Silicon Valley startups that are taking the whole St. Augustine-in-the-desert-thing to the exurbs and with apps. “Paid-for fasting regimens are finding a new audience in the Valley, partly because they’re framed in terms of productivity, not only weight loss,” report Tom Giles and Selina Wang. Believers cite initial research linking fasting with improved focus. But there is not enough data to address the long-term effects of fasting. “What is clear is that restricted-eating plans can make people more susceptible to anorexia nervosa and other disorders,” says the director of programs at the National Eating Disorders Association.\nCreativity through alcohol. The “liquid lunch,” the “drink cart” trundled into the corner office, the bottle of rye in the desk drawer… today’s enlightened office worker can scoff all they want at alcohol’s substantial role in mid-20th century office work. New research reveals that drinking may stimulate creative problem solving. Harvard Business Review’s Alison Beard talks with Prof. Andrew Jarosz of Mississippi State University, who, in the duty of research, fed vodka-crans’ to a test group of men, ages 21 to 30. “The conclusion: drunk people are better at creative problem solving.” Says Prof. Jarosz: “We think that creative problem solving is one area in which a key effect of drunkenness—loss of focus—is a good thing.”\nShare this: MICROSOFT SATYA NADELLA Previous Building a Framework for the Safe Management of Digital Identities and Data Next Machine Learning at Scale Remains Elusive for Many Firms",
