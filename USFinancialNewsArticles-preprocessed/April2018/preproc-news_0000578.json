    "text": "5 Strikingly Simple Lighting Designs that Bridge Art and Architecture These contemporary designs are pared back to essential forms. By Sarah Medford, Photography by Robin Broadbent, Styling by Yolande Gagnier Scroll GET THE GLOW London-based designer Michael Anastassiades took inspiration from fine jewelry to develop his Arrangements modular lighting system for Flos, a kit of eight geometric shapes that can be combined like pendants on a necklace or drops on shoulder-grazing earrings. Each element (a line and a round are shown) consists of an LED flex strip mounted on a black metal frame that can be suspended by cable from the ceiling either individually or in a group. Arrangements, by Michael Anastassiades for FLOS, line about 59\" long, $1,095, round about 13.5\" diameter, $995, canopy, $595, total, $2,685, usa.flos​.com. By Sarah Medford, Photography by Robin Broadbent, Styling by Yolande Gagnier Dipping purposefully like the construction vehicle for which it’s named, the Krane fixture consists of a glass pendant, powered by an integrated LED, a fabric cord, a spool, a counterweight and a tubular steel arch suspended from the ceiling. Also available as a wall mount, Krane is a collaboration, produced by Roll + Hill, between two young design teams: Brooklyn-based Ladies & Gentlemen Studio and Norwegian firm Vera & Kyte. Krane, by Vera & Kyte and Ladies & Gentlemen Studio for Roll + Hill, variable height about 29\" to 80\", $3,850, rollandhill​.com. By Sarah Medford, Photography by Robin Broadbent, Styling by Yolande Gagnier FINE LINES Simple to its core, the Pick Up Stick Floor Lamp—part of a six-piece collection of ambient lighting by Brooklyn-based designer Billy Cotton—features candelabra-style bulbs and slim brass tubing joined together with precision and elegance. Pick Up Stick Floor Lamp, by Billy Cotton, 60\" tall, $2,200, billycotton​.com. By Sarah Medford, Photography by Robin Broadbent, Styling by Yolande Gagnier BRIGHT CLUB A lively network of metal rods animates the Beaubien Three Positions by Montreal-based lighting studio Lambert et Fils. Evoking influences as diverse as the Memphis movement and traditional Chinese screens, the versatile fixture, lit with LED bulbs, can rest on the floor as shown or hang from a wall or the ceiling. Beaubien Three Positions, by Lambert et Fils, 60\" tall as shown, $2,900, lambertetfils​.com. By Sarah Medford, Photography by Robin Broadbent, Styling by Yolande Gagnier New York–based designer Bec Brittain builds an artful assemblage of light and color in her Flags, composed of brass beams bearing LED fixtures and veils of tinted glass that sweep down to the floor like silken banners. The beams can be arranged singly or in multiples. Flags, by Bec Brittain, 75.5\" tall, $12,800, The Future Perfect, thefutureperfect​.com.
