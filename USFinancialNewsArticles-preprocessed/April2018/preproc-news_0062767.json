    "text": "EXTON, Pa., April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- First Resource Bank (OTCQX: FRSB) announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nHighlights for the first quarter of 2018 included:\nNet income of $480,992 was the highest quarterly profit in the Bank's history Net income grew 20% over the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 18% over the quarter ended March 31, 2017 Total interest income grew 3% over the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 14% over the quarter ended March 31, 2017 Total loans grew 11% when comparing March 31, 2018 to March 31, 2017 Net interest margin increased 8 basis points from 3.90% in the quarter ended December 31, 2017 to 3.98% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018\nGlenn B. Marshall, President & CEO, stated, \"We are pleased with first quarter results as we were able to deploy federal income tax savings into enhancing our staffing and moving forward with plans for a third branch, while still achieving record profitability. The Bank's scalability has been enhanced with personnel moves made during the quarter and we are very excited about our planned geographic expansion into the Wayne, Pennsylvania market.\"\nNet income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $480,992, which compares to $401,757 for the previous quarter and $406,553 for the first quarter of the prior year. The first quarter of 2018 was impacted by the lower corporate federal income tax rate as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017.\nNet interest income was $2,397,303 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 as compared to $2,348,581 for the previous quarter, an improvement of 2%. The net interest margin increased 8 basis points from 3.90% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 to 3.98% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. The overall yield on interest earning assets increased 14 basis points during the first quarter led by a 3 basis point increase in loan yields to 5.23%. The cost of interest bearing deposits increased 3 basis points during the first quarter to 0.96%.\nNon-interest income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was $115,742, as compared to $93,721 for the previous quarter and $261,270 for the first quarter of the prior year. There were no gains on sales of SBA loan recognized during the first quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2017, as compared to $155 thousand in gains on sales of SBA loans recognized during the first quarter of 2017.\nNon-interest expense increased $169 thousand, or 10%, in the three months ended March 31, 2018 as compared to the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits, occupancy, advertising, data processing and other costs, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees.\nDeposits grew a net $615 thousand from $210.9 million at December 31, 2017 to $211.5 million at March 31, 2018. During the first quarter, non-interest bearing deposits increased $52 thousand, totaling $25.0 million at December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018. Interest-bearing checking balances decreased $1.2 million, or 12%, from $9.8 million at December 31, 2017 to $8.6 million at March 31, 2018. Money market deposits decreased $836 thousand, or 1%, from $108.5 million at December 31, 2017 to $107.7 million at March 31, 2018. Certificates of deposit increased $2.6 million, or 4%, from $67.7 million at December 31, 2017 to $70.2 million at March 31, 2018.\nThe loan portfolio grew $5.8 million, or 3%, during the first quarter from $217.5 million at December 31, 2017 to $223.3 million at March 31, 2018, with the majority of that growth in commercial real estate loans and construction loans.\nThe following table illustrates the composition of the loan portfolio:\nMar. 31,\n2018\nDec. 31,\n2017\nMar. 31,\n2017\nCommercial real estate\n$ 151,113,428\n$ 147,895,320\n$ 133,235,684\nCommercial construction\n22,295,657\n19,794,234\n19,716,986\nCommercial business\n28,297,067\n28,315,241\n26,727,194\nConsumer\n21,600,352\n21,459,111\n22,347,176\nTotal loans\n$ 223,306,504\n$ 217,463,906\n$ 202,027,040\nThe allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.85% at March 31, 2018 as compared to 0.81% at December 31, 2017 and 0.81% at March 31, 2017. Non-performing assets consisted of non-performing loans of $3.0 million at March 31, 2018, a 1% decrease as compared to the prior quarter. Non-performing assets to total assets increased from 1.13% at December 31, 2017 to 1.17% at March 31, 2018.\nTotal stockholder's equity increased 2% from $23.2 million at December 31, 2017 to $23.5 million at March 31, 2018, primarily due to net income generated. Book value per share increased 14 cents during the first quarter of 2018 to $8.97 per share at March 31, 2018.\nTotal assets decreased $10.7 million, or 4% during the first quarter of 2018. This decline was primarily the result of short term investments purchased near year-end that matured early in the first quarter which were funded with overnight borrowings.\nSelected Financial Data:\nBalance Sheets (unaudited)\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nCash and due from banks\n$ 1,689,709\n$ 2,998,367\nTime deposits at other banks\n599,000\n599,000\nInvestments\n20,353,738\n36,219,930\nLoans\n223,306,504\n217,463,906\nAllowance for loan losses\n(1,888,321)\n(1,751,953)\nPremises & equipment\n5,755,854\n5,671,763\nOther assets\n8,000,132\n7,353,942\nTotal assets\n$ 257,816,616\n$ 268,554,955\nNon-interest bearing deposits\n$ 25,039,012\n$ 24,987,354\nInterest-bearing checking\n8,574,495\n9,755,198\nMoney market\n107,664,560\n108,500,566\nTime deposits\n70,238,585\n67,658,995\nTotal deposits\n211,516,652\n210,902,113\nShort term borrowings\n2,653,000\n17,997,000\nLong term borrowings\n14,915,500\n11,287,500\nSubordinated debt\n3,979,726\n3,977,603\nOther liabilities\n1,227,818\n1,227,099\nTotal liabilities\n234,292,696\n245,391,315\nTotal stockholders' equity\n23,523,920\n23,163,640\nTotal Liabilities &\nStockholders' Equity\n$ 257,816,616\n$ 268,554,955\nPerformance Statistics\n(unaudited)\nQtr Ended\nMar. 31,\n2018\nQtr Ended\nDec. 31,\n2017\nQtr Ended\nSept. 30,\n2017\nQtr Ended\nJune 30,\n2017\nQtr Ended\nMar. 31,\n2017\nNet interest margin\n3.98%\n3.90%\n3.96%\n3.87%\n3.70%\nNonperforming loans/\nTotal loans\n1.35%\n1.39%\n1.54%\n0.99%\n0.71%\nNonperforming assets/\nTotal assets\n1.17%\n1.13%\n1.28%\n0.83%\n0.60%\nAllowance for loan losses/\nTotal loans\n0.85%\n0.81%\n0.86%\n0.80%\n0.81%\nAverage loans/Average\nassets\n86.1%\n84.3%\n84.6%\n84.3%\n82.3%\nNon-interest expenses*/\nAverage assets\n2.84%\n2.57%\n2.68%\n2.78%\n2.75%\nEarnings per share â€“ basic\nand diluted\n$0.18\n$0.15\n$0.18\n$0.18\n$0.19\nBook value per share\n$8.97\n$8.83\n$8.72\n$8.55\n$8.61\nTotal shares outstanding\n2,623,575\n2,621,887\n2,619,773\n2,617,596\n2,102,476\n* Annualized\nIncome Statements (unaudited)\nQtr.
