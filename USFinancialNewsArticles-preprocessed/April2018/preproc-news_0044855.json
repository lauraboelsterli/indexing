    "text": "April 22, 2018 / 8:58 AM / Updated 9 hours ago Korean Air chairman says two daughters will step down from company posts Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nSEOUL, April 22 (Reuters) - Korean Air Lines chairman Cho Yang-ho said on Sunday his two daughters would immediately step down from their positions at the company. \nOne of the daughters, Cho Hyun-min, a senior vice president at the airline, is under investigation by police for possible assault after it was reported she sprayed water at people during a business meeting. \nHer older sister, Heather Cho, made global headlines over a notorious “nut rage” incident in 2014, when she lost her temper over the way she was served nuts in the first class and ordered the Korean Air carrier to return to its gate at a New York airport. \nShe was briefly jailed but returned to work as an executive of Korean Air’s hotel affiliate in March. \nThe father Cho said in a statement that he apologized to South Korean people and his employees.
