    "text": "EDINBURGH, United Kingdom, April 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NuCana plc (Nasdaq:NCNA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on significantly improving treatment outcomes for cancer patients by applying its ProTide™ technology to transform some of the most widely prescribed chemotherapy agents into more effective and safer medicines, announced the appointment of Mr. Adam George, UK Managing Director of GW Pharmaceuticals, to its Board as an independent non executive Director. Mr. George will also serve as Chairman of NuCana’s Audit Committee.\n“We are delighted to welcome Adam to NuCana’s Board of Directors,” said Hugh Griffith, NuCana’s Founder and Chief Executive Officer. “He brings a significant amount of experience and expertise from GW Pharmaceuticals as well as from his career at both public and private companies.”\nMr. George has been the UK Managing Director of GW Pharmaceuticals since March 2017 and also serves as the Company Secretary. GW Pharmaceuticals is a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel therapeutics from its proprietary cannabinoid product platform in a broad range of disease areas. Previously, Mr. George was GW Pharmaceutical’s Chief Financial Officer from 2012 until March 2017 and Financial Controller from 2007 to 2012. Before joining GW Pharmaceuticals, Mr. George held several senior finance roles within both public and private companies. Mr. George holds a BSc. in Biology from Bristol University and is a chartered accountant.\nAbout NuCana plc\nNuCana® is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on significantly improving treatment outcomes for cancer patients by applying our ProTide™ technology to transform some of the most widely prescribed chemotherapy agents, nucleoside analogs, into more effective and safer medicines. While these conventional agents remain part of the standard of care for the treatment of many solid tumors, their efficacy is limited by cancer cell resistance mechanisms and they are often poorly tolerated. Utilizing our proprietary technology, we are developing new medicines, ProTides, designed to overcome key cancer resistance mechanisms and generate much higher concentrations of anti-cancer metabolites in cancer cells.\nOur most advanced ProTide candidates, Acelarin® and NUC-3373, are new chemical entities derived from the nucleoside analogs gemcitabine and 5-fluorouracil, respectively, two widely used chemotherapy agents. Acelarin is currently being evaluated in three clinical studies for patients with ovarian cancer, biliary cancer and pancreatic cancer. NUC-3373 is currently in a Phase 1 study for the potential treatment of a wide range of advanced solid tumors.\nFor more information, please visit: www.nucana.com .\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release may contain “forward‐looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are based on the beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management of NuCana plc (the “Company”).
