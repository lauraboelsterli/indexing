Rest in peace, Ray, you will be dreadfully missed,” the west London club said in a tweet. \nIn a 20-year coaching career Wilkins also managed QPR, Fulham and the Jordan national team. He was assistant manager in two spells at Chelsea where he started out as a player. FA CUP WINNER \nWilkins came through the youth ranks at Chelsea and made his senior debut aged 17 against Norwich City in 1973. \nHe joined United after Chelsea were relegated in the 1978-79 season and won the FA Cup with the Old Trafford club in 1983. Slideshow (4 Images) \nWilkins made his England debut aged 20 against Italy in a tournament in the United States and was a fixture in the England side for the next decade, captaining the team 10 times. \nEngland striker Gary Lineker wrote on Twitter that no team mate was as “helpful and supportive” as Wilkins. \n“Deeply saddened to hear that Ray Wilkins has passed away,” Lineker said. “A wonderful footballer and a delightful man. It was a pleasure to have played alongside him with England.” \nAC Milan, for whom Wilkins made more than 70 appearances between 1984 and 1987, will honour him later on Wednesday when they face city rivals Inter in a Serie A match. \n“Goodbye Ray, you will be missed: tonight we’re gonna fight like you taught us!” Milan said in a tweet. \nFormer Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand also offered his condolences and paid tribute to Wilkins the man and player. \n“Always so humble and softly spoken whenever I saw him. Genuine lovely guy,” Ferdinand said in a tweet. “Watched him... at Loftus Road many times for QPR. What a great passer and teacher of the game for any young kids who watched him.” \nWilkins is survived by his wife Jackie and their two children and grandchildren.
