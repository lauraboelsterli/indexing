    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday pardoned former George W. Bush administration official Lewis “Scooter” Libby, who years ago was convicted of lying in an investigation of the unmasking of a CIA agent, in a step that Democrats immediately criticized.\nIn an arc running from the Iraq war to today, Democrats linked the Libby pardon to Trump’s bitter feud with James Comey, who was fired by Trump as FBI director last year, and to a widening investigation of possible links between the Trump campaign and Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\nThe Libby pardon followed by only hours a Friday morning Twitter attack against Comey by Trump, in which he called the former FBI chief a liar and a leaker. [nL1N1RQ0L7]\nExcerpts of Comey’s new book, “A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership,” give an unflattering portrayal of Trump and have been widely reported in the media this week.\nBefore heading the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Comey was deputy attorney general during the Bush administration. During that time, he appointed a special counsel to prosecute a high-profile case that led to Libby’s guilty verdict in 2007.\n“I don’t know Mr. Libby,” Trump said in a White House statement, “but for years I have heard that he has been treated unfairly. Hopefully, this full pardon will help rectify a very sad portion of his life.”\nLibby could not immediately be reached for comment.\nConservative Republicans had sought a pardon for Libby for years after former Vice President Dick Cheney was unable to persuade Bush to grant one it late in his presidency. Bush did, however, commute Libby’s 2 1/2-year prison sentence.\nLibby, chief of staff to Cheney during the run-up and early years of the Iraq war, was found guilty in 2007 of lying and obstructing an investigation into who blew the cover of CIA officer Valerie Plame. Her husband Joseph Wilson, a former career U.S. diplomat, had criticized the Iraq war.\n‘TROUBLING SIGNAL’ “President Trump’s pardon of Scooter Libby makes clear his contempt for the rule of law,” House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. “This pardon sends a troubling signal to the president’s allies that obstructing justice will be rewarded.”\nRepresentative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said the Libby pardon was Trump’s way “of sending a message to those implicated in the Russia investigation: You have my back and I’ll have yours.”\nThe Libby pardon coincided with the arrival in the White House of John Bolton as Trump’s new national security adviser. Bolton was a key Bush administration advocate, along with Cheney and Libby, of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq.\n“I am grateful today that President Trump righted this wrong by issuing a full pardon to Scooter,” Cheney said in a statement.\nBush spokesman Freddy Ford said, “President Bush is pleased for Scooter and his family.”\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, in a briefing with reporters, said on Friday that the pardon had nothing to do with Trump’s views on Mueller’s investigation.\nTrump has been attacking the FBI amid the investigation of his 2016 presidential campaign for possible links to Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\nPaul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign chairman, and a key Manafort associate are among those who have been indicted in the Russian meddling probe run by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.\nWhite House aides said earlier this week that Trump was fuming over FBI raids related to the investigation on Monday of the office and home of his personal attorney, Michael Cohen.\nTrump has repeatedly called Mueller’s probe a “witch hunt” and he and Russia have both denied any wrongdoing.\nIt was the second high-profile pardon of Trump’s tenure. Last year, he pardoned Joe Arpaio, a former Arizona sheriff who campaigned for Trump, less than a month after he was convicted of criminal contempt in a case involving racial profiling.\nFile Photo: U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney is pictured with Chief of Staff I.
