    "text": "SINGAPORE, April 17 (Reuters) -\n* Malaysia will export 10 cargoes of the Kimanis grade of crude oil in June, down 1 cargo from the previous month, trade sources said on Tuesday\n* Malaysia’s Petronas will export four cargoes, while Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips have two cargoes each, the sources said\n* Indonesia’s Pertamina and Petroleum Brunei will export a cargo each, according to the sources. Oil companies do not typically comment on such trade flows\n* One of the 10 cargoes will be a crossover cargo, one of the sources said, meaning it would be for either May/June or June/July\n* ConocoPhillips may have sold a May-loading Kimanis cargo at a premium of about $3.50 a barrel to dated Brent, traders have said, though the deal could not be confirmed (Reporting by Jessica Jaganathan Editing by Joseph Radford)\n ",
