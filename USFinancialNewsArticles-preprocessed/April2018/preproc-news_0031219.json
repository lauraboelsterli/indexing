    "text": "Padres left-hander Joey Lucchesi out-pitched fellow rookie starter Tyler Beede, and Christian Villanueva and Jose Pirela drove in three runs apiece as San Diego defeated the Giants 10-1 at Petco Park on Sunday.\nLucchesi (2-0) held the Giants to one run on five hits with a career-high nine strikeouts over six innings as the Padres won a third straight game in the four-game series to move past the Giants into third in the National League West.\nThe 24-year-old Lucchesi has a 1.66 earned run average in four major league starts and has allowed only two unearned runs on 10 hits and four walks with 24 strikeouts over 17 innings in his past three starts.\nVillanueva put the Padres ahead with a two-run double in the third off Beede then he hit a solo homer — the third baseman’s fifth of the season — leading off the fifth against Giants left-handed reliever Josh Osich.\nPirela was 3-for-5 with a double and a triple for three RBIs and three runs scored. He also stole a base.\nAfter Villanueva’s double in the third, the Padres scored three more off Beede in the fourth. Chase Headley drew a leadoff walk and scored on Cory Spangenberg’s double to the left-center gap. Pirela doubled home Spangenberg and scored on a single by Freddy Galvis.\nFranchy Cordero also had two hits and a RBI for the Padres while Galvis had a RBI single and drew a career-high three walks.\nBeede allowed five runs on six hits and three walks with six strikeouts in 3 2/3 innings to suffer his first major league defeat in his second start.\nThe Giants took a 1-0 lead in the second on back-to-back singles by Nick Hundley and Evan Longoria and a sacrifice fly by Brandon Belt. Hundley and Longoria each had two hits for San Francisco.\nThe Padres have a 23-10 record against the Giants since losing nine straight to San Francisco to open the 2016 season.\n— Field Level Media\n ",
