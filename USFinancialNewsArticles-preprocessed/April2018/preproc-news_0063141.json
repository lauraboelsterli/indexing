    "text": "HOUSTON, April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Oasis Petroleum Inc. (NYSE: OAS) (\"Oasis\" or the \"Company\") announced today select preliminary unaudited financial results for the first quarter of 2018. Management has prepared, and is responsible for, the preliminary financial data presented below, which is based on the most current information available. The Company's normal financial reporting processes with respect to the preliminary financial data have not been fully completed, and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not audited, reviewed, compiled or applied agreed-upon procedures with respect to the preliminary financial data. Accordingly, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP does not express an opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto.\nThis summary is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of the Company's financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 pursuant to GAAP. The operating results for an interim period, including the preliminary financial data provided below, may not give a true indication of the results to be expected for a full year or any future period. The assumptions and estimates underlying the preliminary financial information are inherently uncertain and, although the Company considers them reasonable as of the date hereof, they are subject to a wide variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the prospective financial information.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Oasis produced volumes at the high end of its guidance range of 75,000 to 77,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (\"Boepd\"), delivering 76,819 Boepd, of which 76.4% was oil. Oasis produced 74,425 Boepd and 2,394 Boepd during the first quarter of 2018 in the Williston Basin and the Delaware Basin, respectively. Volumes in the Delaware Basin averaged 3,652 Boepd since closing the acquisition. During the first quarter of 2018, NYMEX West Texas Intermediate Crude oil index (\"WTI\") price averaged $62.87 per barrel, and Oasis expects to realize between $61.15 and $61.25 per barrel of oil, without derivative settlements. For the first quarter of 2018, Oasis expects to realize $4.05 to $4.15 per Mcf for natural gas, which is without derivative settlements and includes the value for natural gas and natural gas liquids.\nThe following table provides Oasis's preliminary expense and capital expenditures estimates for the quarter ended March 31, 2018:\nMetric\nRange\nLease operating expenses ($ per Boe)\n$6.45 to $6.55\nMarketing, transportation and gathering expenses ($ per Boe) (1)\n$2.95 to $3.05\nGeneral and administrative expenses ($MM)\n$27.8 to $28.1\nProduction taxes (% of oil and gas revenue)\n8.50% to 8.55%\nMidstream and well services - revenues less operating expenses ($MM) (2)\n$24.0 to $24.2\nCapital Expenditures ($MM)\nE&P\n$176.0 to $177.5\nWell services\n$4.0 to $4.5\nOther\n$6.0 to $6.5\nMidstream\n$88.0 to $89.0\nTotal capital expenditures before acquisitions\n$274.0 to $277.5\nAcquisitions\n$890.0 to $892.0\nTotal capital expenditures\n$1,164.0 to $1,169.5\n1)\nExcludes non-cash valuation charges on pipeline imbalances and purchased oil and gas expenses.\n2)\nRepresents midstream revenues and well services revenues less midstream operating expenses and well services operating expenses, excluding all intercompany revenues and expenses for work performed by the midstream services and well services business segments for Oasis's working interests that are eliminated in consolidation and are therefore not included in midstream services and well services revenues and expenses.\nCapital expenditures for the quarter were in line with Oasis's first quarter 2018 budget, and the Company is reiterating its original guidance for all full year metrics that were provided in February 2018.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had $626.0 million of loans and $14.0 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the its revolving credit facility, resulting in an unused borrowing base committed capacity of $710.0 million.
