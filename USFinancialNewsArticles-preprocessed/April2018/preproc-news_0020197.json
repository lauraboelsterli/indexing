    "text": "PRAGUE, April 11 (Reuters) - The Czech government picked a consortium of CzechToll and SkyToll to operate the country’s highway toll from 2020 in a 10-year contract worth 10.7 billion crowns ($522.89 million), Transport Minister Dan Tok said on Wednesday.\nCzechToll is controlled by richest Czech businessman Petr Kellner’s PPF group while SkyToll operates the highway toll system in neighbouring Slovakia. The Czech-Slovak consortium beat a bid by current toll operator Kapsch of Austria.\nUnsuccessful bidders still have an appeal period.\n$1 = 20.4630 Czech crowns Reporting by Jason Hovet\n ",
