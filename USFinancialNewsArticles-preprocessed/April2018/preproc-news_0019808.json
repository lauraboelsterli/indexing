    "text": "PARKER, Colo., April 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Assure Holdings Corp. (the “Company” or “Assure”) (TSXV:IOM) (OTCQB:ARHH), a provider of intraoperative neuromonitoring services, has appointed Kent J. Lund to its board of directors, effective April 9 th . He will also serve on Assure’s audit committee. Lund is the Company’s fourth board member and the third serving independently.\nFor nearly 20 years, Lund has worked in various business, legal and securities compliance roles within the financial services industry. He currently serves as a member of the Colorado Securities Board.\nPrior roles include: general counsel and chief compliance officer for SDR Ventures, a private investment banking firm; executive vice president and chief compliance officer for George K. Baum, a private securities broker-dealer; chief compliance officer for Prairie Capital Management, a multi-billion-dollar registered investment adviser; and executive vice president and general counsel for Kirkpatrick, Pettis, Smith, Polian, another private securities broker-dealer. Before working in financial services, Lund served as a law clerk for two federal court of appeals judges, in private legal practice with a large law firm, and as a domestic U.S. and international attorney for a large multinational oil, gas and petrochemical company.\n“Kent is a highly-experienced business, legal and securities compliance professional that brings our board significant and complementary experience,” said Preston Parsons, Assure’s founder and chairman. “This includes building and managing compliance and legal departments, drafting and implementing securities compliance policies and procedures, as well as deep experience managing numerous SEC and FINRA inquiries and examinations. We welcome his skillset to our board and are confident his experience will be invaluable as we continue to expand our platform throughout the U.S.”\nLund has also served in public and private company director and/or corporate secretary roles, including as an independent director on two public company board audit committees.\nLund commented on his appointment: “I believe that Assure has created a unique IOM platform that has significant opportunity for long-term, national growth. I look forward to leveraging my relevant experience to strengthen the board’s focus on best practices in corporate governance as we position the company to grow its footprint and strengthen its brand position.”\nLund earned his Master of Laws from the University of Colorado Law School, his MBA from the University of Colorado, his JD with honors from Drake University Law School, and his BA magna cum laude from Midland Lutheran College. He is licensed to practice law in Colorado, Iowa and Nebraska, as well as various federal courts, including the Supreme Court of the United States.\nLund’s appointment remains subject to review and approval by the TSX Venture exchange.\nAbout Assure Holdings\nAssure Holdings Corp. is a Colorado-based company that works with neurosurgeons and orthopedic spine surgeons to provide a turnkey suite of services that support intraoperative neuromonitoring activities during invasive surgeries.
