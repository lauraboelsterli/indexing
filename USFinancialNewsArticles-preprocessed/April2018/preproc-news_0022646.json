    "text": "April 11, 2018 / 2:23 AM / Updated 6 hours ago Stoinis, fast bowlers added to Australia central contracts list Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nSYDNEY (Reuters) - All-rounder Marcus Stoinis and fast bowlers Jhye Richardson, Kane Richardson and Andrew Tye have been awarded central contracts with Cricket Australia for the first time as the team looks to focus on limited overs cricket over the next 12 months. Britain Cricket - Australia Nets - The Oval - June 4, 2017 Australia's Marcus Stoinis during nets Action Images via Reuters / Peter Cziborra Livepic \nWicketkeeper Alex Carey, who made his international debut in both Twenty20 and one-day cricket earlier this year, was also given a central contract for the first time. \nFormer captain Steve Smith, vice-captain David Warner and opening batsman Cameron Bancroft were all predictably missing from the 20-man list released on Wednesday following their role in the recent ball-tampering scandal. \nSmith and Warner were both banned for 12 months, and Bancroft for nine months for colluding to rough up the ball with sandpaper during the third test against South Africa last month. \nAll three have said they would accept the bans. \nAustralia have a heavy limited-overs programme over the next 12 months, with the World Cup in England next June and July the focus, chairman of selectors Trevor Hohns said. \n“This period is set to include a significant amount of limited-overs cricket, including the ... Cricket World Cup 2019 in England and Wales,” Hohns said. Cricket - World Twenty20 cricket tournament practice session - Dharamsala, India, 17/03/2016. AustraliaÄôs Andrew Tye prepares to bowl.
