    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The New York attorney general’s office is investigating the fatal shooting by police of an unarmed black man who pointed a metal pipe at officers in Brooklyn in the latest such killing to prompt street protests.\nThe death of Saheed Vassell on Wednesday was one of a string of fatal shootings of unarmed black men by police that has fueled a renewed debate about racial bias in law enforcement and the U.S. criminal justice system.\n“We’re committed to conducting an independent, comprehensive and fair investigation,” Amy Spitalnick, a spokeswoman for New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, said in a statement on Thursday.\nPolice said Vassell was killed by officers responding to reports of a man aiming a gun at pedestrians. When the officers arrived, police said, Vassell took a two-handed shooting stance and pointed an object at them.\nThe officers believed the suspect was holding a firearm, a senior police official told a news conference on Wednesday, and three plainclothes officers and one uniformed officer fired 10 shots. Vassell later died in a hospital.\nSaheed Vassell points a metal pipe at a pedestrian in Brooklyn April 4, 2018, in a still image from surveillance video released by the New York Police Department in New York City, New York, U.S. on April 5, 2018. NYPD/Handout via REUTERS Police on Thursday released security camera footage that showed Vassell approaching people in the street and pointing the pipe at them like a pistol, as well as partial transcripts of three 911 calls.\n“There’s a guy walking around the street, he looks like he’s crazy but he’s pointing something at people that looks like a gun and he’s pulling the trigger,” one of the callers said.\nLocal media reported Vassell was 34-years-old, suffered from mental illness, and was well known in parts of Brooklyn’s Crown Heights neighborhood.\nSlideshow (5 Images) By mid-afternoon Thursday, more than 1,000 people had indicated on Facebook that they would attend a rally later in the day to demand justice for Vassell.\nHis killing followed the fatal shooting by police of an unarmed black man, Stephon Clark, 22, in Sacramento, California, that has sparked more than two weeks of demonstrations. Officers responding to a report of someone breaking windows killed Clark on March 18 in his grandmother’s yard. The officers feared he had a gun, but it turned out he was holding a cellphone, Sacramento police said.\nReporting by Gina Cherelus in New York; Additional reporting by Bernie Woodall in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Editing by Daniel Wallis, Bill Trott and Tom Brown\n ",
