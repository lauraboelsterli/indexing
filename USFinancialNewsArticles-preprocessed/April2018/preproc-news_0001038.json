    "text": "First Ethereum-powered Real Estate Buying and Renting Solution Provider Expands Its Team to Support Growth and New Ventures\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ShelterZoom , creator of the first blockchain-based real estate offer and acceptance solution which can be easily integrated with any real estate website, today announced three additions to its advisory team. The company also announced the expansion of its executive team with three key hires to help it navigate a strong growth trajectory and prepare for several game-changing initiatives to be announced later this year.\nJoining the advisory team are:\nMichael (Qinyu) Zhang (China), is the co-founder of Baozun (NASDAQ:BZUN), often referred to as “China's Shopify” and the largest brand e-commerce business partner in China. Zhang previously served as Baozun's president and successfully secured the company’s NASDAQ listing. Prior to Baozun, he spent 10 years at Philips Lighting in various roles and was VP of global markets at NVC Lighting in Hong Kong. Zhang brings a wealth of business experience and wisdom to the advisory team in addition to international connections.\nJeremy Crawford (Raleigh, NC), is CEO of Real Estate Standards Organization (RESO), an independent, not-for-profit trade organization that was previously a section of the National Association of REALTORS®, which actively develops, adopts and implements open and accepted data standards and processes across all real estate transactions. Prior to RESO, Crawford was COO and CIO at MLSListings Inc., which serves 16,000 real estate professionals and more than 6,000 firms throughout Northern California.\nSergey Fradkov (New York), Technical Advisor, is a serial entrepreneur, manager, advisor and investor. He is responsible for several venture-backed startups and exits, and launched a startup accelerator. Fradkov is a natural fit for ShelterZoom given his extensive tech industry experience and interest in the token economy and UGCs. Some of the companies where he has served as an executive over the past 25 years include AFIC Technologies, UNIF/X, Inc., w-Technologies and DynoPlex, Inc. He currently serves as an advisor to several startups in the cryptocurrency space, including those involved in ICOs, tokenomics and utility tokens.\nJoining the executive team are:\nDmitry Goroshevsky (Israel), serves as Chief Architect and has been the driving force behind ShelterZoom’s two blockchain-based real estate solutions built on the Ethereum platform, Offer NOW and Rent NOW. He has also put together a talented development team that includes Informatics Olympiad-winning engineers. Goroshevsky is a co-founder of several blockchain projects and is the co-author of patents in serverless p2p and blockchain technologies from his stint as co-founder and CEO of Popular Telephony. Prior to that he was the co-founder and CEO of DeltaThree, one of the first companies in the world to offer a telephony service over the internet, and Internet Telecom Ltd., one of the first IP telephony core technology development companies that led to the adoption of IP in broadband cable and PBX.\nDonna R. Oliva (New York), is the company’s general counsel and a seasoned C-level executive and entrepreneur. Prior to joining ShelterZoom, Oliva co-founded w-Technologies with Mr. Sergey Fradkov, which was the first company to introduce mobile apps for stock trading, banking, cash management and logistics, and also a wireless app development platform. Prior to that she founded UNIF/X Inc., a full-service software development company specializing in database and internet technology solutions for multinational companies. Born and raised in New York, Oliva received her JD/MBA from Boston University and a BS in Accounting from New York University.\nMazhar Suleman (Dubai), is the director of marketing at ShelterZoom and also serves as CEO at Bester Capital Media, a subsidiary of Bester Capital Investments, Dubai. A digital marketing expert, Suleman runs ShelterZoom’s marketing function and co-leads Dubai sales. He provides expertise in setting up profitable new businesses and managing them across international markets, along with building creative and technical teams.\n\"ShelterZoom is well on the way to becoming a major technology player in real estate buying, selling and renting,” said Chao Cheng-Shorland, co-founder and CEO of ShelterZoom. “To help us get there, we knew that building a world-class executive team and advisory council was a critical next step, and that’s exactly what we’ve done.”\n“We’re thrilled to have Michael, Jeremy and Sergey join our advisory team,” commented Allen Alishahi, ShelterZoom’s co-founder and president. “Together with executive team members Dmitry, Donna and Mazhar, we’ve added C-level and founder experience that is rare in the real estate tech industry. They will be invaluable as we roll out our blockchain-based, online buying and renting platforms in North America, Europe, APAC, the Middle East, South America and Africa.”\nAbout ShelterZoom\nShelterZoom™ is the first real estate technology company to have successfully delivered a blockchain-based real estate offer and acceptance platform to the mass market. The company plans to release its second blockchain-based platform, “Rent NOW” (for online renting), this month.
