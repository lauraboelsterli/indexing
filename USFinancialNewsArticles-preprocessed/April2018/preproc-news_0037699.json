    "text": "SAN RAFAEL, Calif., April 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Westamerica Bancorporation (Nasdaq:WABC), parent company of Westamerica Bank, generated net income for the first quarter 2018 of $17.5 million and diluted earnings per common share (\"EPS\") of $0.66, compared to first quarter 2017 net income of $15.0 million and EPS of $0.57. Fourth quarter 2017 net income of $4.2 million and EPS of $0.16 include adjustments to asset values triggered by enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Act”), recognition of a loss contingency, and securities gains which collectively reduced EPS by $0.42.\n\"First quarter 2018 net income benefited from higher interest income as rising market interest rates are benefiting our asset yields. Our funding costs were unchanged, however, at 0.04 percent of earning assets due to the predominance of low-cost checking and savings accounts in our deposit base. Net interest income was $34.0 million for the first quarter 2018, compared to $33.7 million for the fourth quarter 2017 and $32.8 million for the first quarter 2017. First quarter 2018 net income also benefited from Westamerica’s operating efficiency; noninterest expenses were $24.2 million for the first quarter 2018 compared to $24.6 million for the first quarter 2017, said Chairman, President and CEO David Payne. “Asset quality remains strong with nonperforming assets totaling only $7.8 million at March 31, 2018, and net loan loss recoveries of $72 thousand for the first quarter 2018. First quarter 2018 results generated an 11.6 percent return on average common equity for our shareholders,” concluded Payne.\nInterest income earned on loans and securities was $34.5 million for the first quarter 2018, compared to $34.2 million for the fourth quarter 2017 and $33.3 million for the first quarter 2017. Interest expense paid on deposits and short-term borrowed funds was $459 thousand for the first quarter 2018, compared to $471 thousand for the fourth quarter 2017 and $480 thousand for the first quarter 2017. Checking and savings deposits represented ninety-five percent of the Company’s average deposit base during the first quarter 2018; checking and savings deposits are less sensitive to rising interest rates than time deposits.\nThe Company recognized no provision for loan losses for the first quarter 2018 given stable nonperforming loan volumes and other credit quality attributes. At March 31, 2018, the allowance for loan losses totaled $23.1 million compared to $23.0 million at December 31, 2017.\nNoninterest income for the first quarter 2018 totaled $12.0 million, compared to $20.3 million for the fourth quarter 2017 and $11.7 million for the first quarter 2017. Noninterest income for the fourth quarter 2017 included $8.0 million in securities gains.\nNoninterest expense for the first quarter 2018 totaled $24.2 million, compared to $30.2 million for the fourth quarter 2017 and $24.6 million for the first quarter 2017. Noninterest expense for the fourth quarter 2017 included a $625 thousand impairment of low income housing limited partnership investments due to enactment of the Act and a $5.5 million loss contingency accrual.\nThe book tax provision for the first quarter 2018 was $4.3 million, compared to $19.7 million for the fourth quarter 2017 and $4.8 million for the first quarter 2017, representing effective tax rates of 19.7 percent, 82.6 percent and 24.3 percent, respectively. The book tax provisions for the first quarter 2018 and the first quarter 2017 include tax benefits of $451 thousand and $671 thousand, respectively, for tax deductions from the exercise of employee stock options which exceed related compensation expenses recognized in the financial statements; these benefits reduced the effective tax rate by 2.0 percent and 3.4 percent, respectively. The lower effective tax rate for the first quarter 2018 reflects a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate due to the Act. The book tax provision for the fourth quarter 2017 includes a charge of $12.3 million to re-measure the Company’s net deferred tax asset triggered by enactment of the Act.\nWestamerica Bancorporation, through its wholly owned subsidiary Westamerica Bank, operates commercial banking and trust offices throughout Northern and Central California.\nWestamerica Bancorporation Web Address: www.westamerica.com\nFor additional information contact:\nWestamerica Bancorporation\n1108 Fifth Avenue, San Rafael, CA 94901\nRobert A.

(FTE) Fully Taxable Equivalent. The Company presents its net interest margin and net interest income on a FTE basis using the current statutory federal tax rate. Management believes the FTE basis is valuable to the reader because the Company’s loan and investment securities portfolios contain a relatively large portion of municipal loans and securities that are federally tax exempt. The Company’s tax exempt loans and securities composition may not be similar to that of other banks, therefore in order to reflect the impact of the federally tax exempt loans and securities on the net interest margin and net interest income for comparability with other banks, the Company presents its net interest margin and net interest income on a FTE basis. (a) Annualized (1) All originated and purchased non performing loans and repossessed loan collateral have been combined as of Q1 '17. Prior period presentation has been updated, accordingly. (2) Represents the Company's estimated refunds to customers of revenue recognized in prior years.\nSource:Westamerica Bancorporation",
