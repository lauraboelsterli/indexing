    "text": "* Spec Eurodollar, 5-year T-note net shorts hit record highs (Adds details on latest data, table) April 6 (Reuters) - Speculators' net bearish bets on U.S. 10-year Treasury note futures rose to their highest in about 13 months earlier this week, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released on Friday. Bets on Treasury prices falling came even amid safe-haven bids for bonds due to worries about growing trade tensions between the United States and China. The amount of speculators' bearish, or short, positions in 10-year Treasury futures exceeded bullish, or long, positions by 375,365 contracts on April 3, according to the CFTC's latest Commitments of Traders data. This was the largest amount of net shorts in 10-year T-note futures since the record 409,659 contracts in the week of Feb. 28, 2017. A week earlier, speculators held 305,212 net short positions in 10-year T-note futures. Meanwhile, speculative net short positions in five-year T-note futures grew by 144,701 contracts to an all-time high amount of 579,306 contracts earlier this week. Speculators' net shorts in Eurodollar futures also reached a record high at 4.013 million contracts on Tuesday.
