Revenues from construction materials increased by $0.9 million, or 8.1%, to $11.4 million for the second half of 2017 from $10.6 million for the same period of the prior year. The increase in revenues from construction materials was related to increases in both sales volume and average selling price.\nMunicipal construction includes such projects as sponge city projects, sewage pipeline construction, public plaza construction, and landscaping. Our environmental-friendly construction materials such as brick and block may be used in these municipal construction projects as required by local governments. Revenues from municipal construction projects were $0.3 million related to one municipal construction project for the second half of 2017. We did not book revenues from municipal construction projects in the second half of 2016.\nWe started to provide environmental-protection related consulting services to customers in the second half of 2016.

As a comparison, net other expenses were $1.0 million, including interest expense of $0.7 million and other expenses of $0.3 million, for the same period of the prior year.
