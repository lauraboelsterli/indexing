(TSX:SJR.B) (TSX:SJR.PR.A) (TSX:SJR.PR.B) (NYSE:SJR) (TSX-V:SJR.A) announces consolidated financial and operating results for the quarter ended February 28, 2018. Revenue from continuing operations for the quarter of $1.36 billion increased 12.4% over the comparable period led by Wireless and Business results. Operating income before restructuring costs and amortization 1 for the quarter of $501 million was consistent with results in the second quarter of fiscal 2017.\n“Our strong second quarter results clearly show that Canadians have a demand for a truly competitive wireless option,” said Brad Shaw, Chief Executive Officer. “Our strategy to grow our Wireless business has been simple: create a wireless provider that offers fairness and value to Canadians and that respects people’s desire to connect when they want, how much they want, and on the iconic devices they want.”\n“We are successfully executing our Wireless plan. This quarter, which included a very busy holiday season, we set a record with more than 93 thousand net postpaid subscriber additions. The confidence that new and existing customers have in our service has only strengthened our resolve to continue investing in our network while growing our market share through pricing and packaging options, such as our Big Gig data plans,” said Brad Shaw.\nShaw continues to improve the Wireless experience for its customers including an expanded distribution platform through our first agreement with a national retailer. Launching in April, Loblaws’ ‘The Mobile Shop’ will sell Freedom Mobile handsets and service plans in approximately 100 of their locations across Canada. In addition, another significant network milestone has been achieved with the refarm of 10 MHz of AWS-1 spectrum now complete across Freedom Mobile’s footprint. The Company continues to actively roll out its 2500 and 700 MHz spectrum which further improves the network quality and will enable additional features such as VoLTE.\nBrad Shaw continued: “We commend the federal government on its support for strong and sustainable competition, as reflected in the recent announcement of a set-aside for the upcoming 600 MHz auction. This decision will help ensure a future for wireless competition in Canada and is a significant win for all Canadians, who deserve more from their wireless services.”\n“In the two years since we acquired our Wireless business, we have made significant investments and improvements to our network and our service. We are excited by the tremendous growth potential of this business, and, as shown by our results this quarter, we are committed to delivering a strong and competitive wireless alternative that will benefit all Canadians,” said Brad Shaw.\nSelected Financial Highlights\nThree months ended February 28, Six months ended February 28, (millions of Canadian dollars except per share amounts) 2018 2017 Change % 2018 2017 Change % Revenue 1,355 1,206 12.4 2,604 2,422 7.5 Operating income before restructuring costs and amortization 1 501 503 (0.4) 982 1,007 (2.5) Operating margin 1 37.0 % 41.7 % (4.7pts) 37.7 % 41.6 % (3.9pts) Free cash flow 1 135 147 (8.2) 187 305 (38.7) Net income (loss) from continuing operations (164 ) 150 (>100.0) (44 ) 244 (>100.0) Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax - (3 ) >100.0 (6 ) (7 ) 14.3 Net income (loss) (164 ) 147 (>100.0) (50 ) 237 (>100.0) Diluted earnings (loss) per share (0.33 ) 0.30 (0.11 ) 0.48 (1) See definitions and discussion under “Non-IFRS and additional GAAP measures in the accompanying MD&A”.\nNet loss for the quarter of $164 million compared to net income of $147 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease substantially reflects $417 million restructuring related costs recorded during the second quarter of 2018 in respect to the Total Business Transformation (“TBT”) initiative and related Voluntary Departure Program (“VDP”) accepted by eligible employees, as further described below.\nFree cash flow 1 for the quarter of $135 million compared to $147 million in the prior year. The decrease for the quarter was largely due to planned higher capital spending.\nTotal Wireless revenue of $290 million improved 106% year-over-year as equipment revenue of $148 million compared to $24 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and service revenue improved 21% to $142 million. Wireless operating income before restructuring costs and amortization of $36 million improved 24% year-over-year primarily due to the growth in subscribers and higher average revenue per unit (“ARPU”), partially offset by incremental costs from higher subscriber loading in the period and margin pressure from significantly higher equipment sales.\nIn the quarter, the Company added approximately 89,700 net Wireless revenue generating units (“RGUs”) - (postpaid +93,500/prepaid -3,800), an increase of more than 2.5 times the 33,400 net additions achieved in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in the customer base reflects customer demand for the iPhone combined with our device pricing and packaging options and the ongoing execution of our wireless growth strategy to improve the network and customer experience.\nSecond quarter Wireline revenue and operating income before restructuring costs and amortization of $1.07 billion and $465 million remained flat and declined 1.9%, respectively. While revenue held flat, the year-over-year decline in Wireline operating income before restructuring costs and amortization continues to be impacted by a challenging Consumer video environment, including a declining customer base and a general shift into lower priced video packages. The decline in Video and Phone subscribers more than offset the positive impact of continued Internet growth. Shaw Business delivered another solid quarter, with second quarter revenue up 5.3% year-over-year to $140 million.\nWireline RGUs declined by approximately 25,600 in the quarter compared to a loss of approximately 6,900 in the second quarter of 2017. Internet gains of approximately 5,500 in the quarter were more than fully offset by video, phone and satellite RGU losses.\nIn the quarter, the Company introduced TBT, a multi-year initiative designed to reinvent Shaw’s operating model to better meet the evolving needs and expectations of consumers and businesses by reducing staff, optimizing the use of resources and maintaining and ultimately improving customer service. Three key elements of the transformation are to: 1) shift customer interactions to digital platforms; 2) drive more self-install and self-serve; and, 3) streamline the organization that builds and services the networks. As part of the TBT initiative, the Company also plans to reduce input costs, consolidate functions, and streamline processes, which is expected to create operational improvements across the business allowing it to evolve into a more efficient organization.\nAs a first step in the TBT, the VDP was offered to eligible employees. The outcome of the program had approximately 3,300 Shaw employees accepting the VDP package representing approximately 25% of all employees. As part of the program design, the majority of customer-facing employees (i.e., Customer Care, Retail, Sales) were not eligible to participate in the VDP. A large portion of employees who elected to participate in the VDP are in functions that will be addressed through the aforementioned key elements of the TBT and Shaw has control over the timing of employee departures across the Company through an actively managed, orderly transition over the next 18 months. In select functions, the Company determined that some employees will transition over a 24-month period, an extension from the 18-month period initially expected. Approximately 1,200 employees will be exiting before the end of fiscal 2018.\nIn connection with various TBT activities, including the VDP, Shaw has incurred a restructuring charge of $417 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily related to severance and other employee related costs, as well as additional costs directly associated with the TBT initiative. While the restructuring charge has been recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 results, the actual timing of employee payments related to the charge will occur over a 24-month period, starting March 29, 2018. The Company does not anticipate the full-year TBT restructuring costs to exceed $450 million.\nThe anticipated annualized savings, which include reductions in operating expenses and capital expenditures (i.e. labour costs that can be identified or associated with a capital project), related to the VDP, are expected to be approximately $215 million and will be fully realized in fiscal 2020. Shaw expects these cost reductions to be weighted 60% to operating expenses, being approximately $130 million, and 40% to capital expenditures, being approximately $85 million (compared to the $225 million equally weighted estimate of 50% operating expenses and 50% capital expenditures initially estimated at the end of the VDP). VDP related cost reductions in fiscal 2018 are expected to be approximately $48 million, of which approximately $40 million will be attributed to operating expenses and approximately $8 million attributed to capital expenditures. See also “Introduction”, “Other Income and Expense Items”, “Caution Concerning Forward Looking Statements” and “Risks and Uncertainties” in the accompanying Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) for a discussion of the TBT, the VDP and the risks and assumptions associated therewith.\nThe Company confirms that it remains on track to meet its fiscal 2018 guidance which includes consolidated operating income before restructuring costs and amortization growing to approximately $2.1 billion – an increase of approximately 5% over fiscal 2017; capital investments of approximately $1.38 billion; and free cash flow 1 of approximately $375 million. Shaw’s guidance confirmation includes assumptions related to cost reductions that will be achieved through TBT initiatives (specifically the VDP); roaming cost reductions of approximately $12 million expected to be realized in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 associated with the CRTC finalizing wholesale mobile wireless roaming rates; and short-term incremental costs associated with growth in Wireless handset sales. See also “Caution Concerning Forward Looking Statements” in the accompanying MD&A.\nBrad Shaw concluded, “Our company is at a pivotal moment and we are solidly committed to our long-term growth strategy to capitalize on efficiencies, streamline processes and improve our business through the Total Business Transformation initiative. Our teams of dedicated people are working every day to enhance our customers’ experiences – by building on the strengths and potential of our Wireless operations while creating an operating model in our Wireline business that allows us to improve and streamline our service.”\nShaw Communications Inc. is a leading Canadian connectivity company.

We have taken purposeful strides to evolve Shaw’s value proposition of providing leading and innovative products and services, drive operational momentum and enhance our customers’ connectivity experience. From technology to network deployment, marketing to product pricing and packaging, and billing to service delivery, we are developing a connectivity experience made possible through converging platforms that are designed to meet the evolving demands of our customers.\nIn the quarter, the Company introduced TBT, a multi-year initiative designed to reinvent Shaw’s operating model to better meet the changing tastes and expectations of consumers and businesses by reducing staff, optimizing the use of resources, and maintaining and ultimately improving customer service. Three key elements of TBT are to: 1) shift customer interactions to digital platforms; 2) drive more self-install and self-serve; and, 3) streamline the organization that builds and services the network. As part of the TBT initiative, the Company also plans to reduce input costs, consolidate functions, and streamline processes, which is expected to create operational improvements across the business allowing it to evolve into a more efficient organization.\nAs a first step in the TBT, the VDP was offered to eligible employees. The outcome of the program had approximately 3,300 Shaw employees accepting the offer representing approximately 25% of all employees. As part of the program design, the majority of customer-facing employees (i.e., Customer Care, Retail, Sales) were not eligible to participate in the VDP. A large portion of employees who elected to participate in the VDP are in functions that will be addressed through the aforementioned key elements of the TBT and Shaw has control over the timing of employee departures across the Company through an actively managed, orderly transition over the next 18 months. In select functions, the Company determined that some employees will transition over a 24-month period, an extension from the 18-month period initially expected. Approximately 1,200 employees will be exiting before the end of fiscal 2018.\nIn connection with various TBT activities, including the VDP, Shaw has incurred a restructuring charge of $417 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, primarily related to severance and other employee related costs, as well as additional costs directly associated with the TBT initiative. While the restructuring charge has been recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 results, the actual timing of employee payments related to the charge will occur over a 24-month period, starting March 29, 2018. The Company does not anticipate full-year TBT restructuring costs to exceed $450 million.\nThe anticipated annualized savings, which include reductions in operating expenses and capital expenditures (i.e. labour costs that can be identified or associated with a capital project), related to the VDP, are expected to be approximately $215 million and will be fully realized in fiscal 2020. Shaw expects these cost reductions to be weighted 60% to operating expenses, being approximately $130 million, and 40% to capital expenditures, being approximately $85 million (compared to the $225 million equally weighted estimate of 50% operating expenses and 50% capital expenditures initially estimated at the end of the VDP). VDP related cost reductions in fiscal 2018 are expected to be approximately $48 million, of which approximately $40 million will be attributed to operating expenses and $8 million attributed to capital expenditures. See also “Other Income and Expense Items”, “Caution Concerning Forward Looking Statements” and “Risks and Uncertainties” for a discussion of the TBT, the VDP and the risks and assumptions associated therewith.\nWireless\nIn our Wireless business, our goal remains simple - to provide Canadians with sustainable and exceptional value and choice in their wireless carrier. On the back of our robust LTE-Advanced network, which is continuously improving, our ‘Big Gig’ data plans and the iPhone 8 and iPhone X experienced strong demand throughout the quarter.\nWe have a clear strategy for growing our Wireless business and our strong second quarter results are yet another indicator that we are successfully executing on our plan. During the quarter, which included a busy holiday season and official launch of the iPhone, we achieved a record quarter with net postpaid subscriber additions of over 93 thousand. Our Wireless network is continuously improving and we expect to profitably grow our market share through pricing and packaging options such as our Big Gig data plans.\nShaw continues to improve the Wireless experience for its customers including an expanded distribution platform through our first agreement with a national retailer. Launching in April, Loblaws’ ‘The Mobile Shop’ will sell Freedom Mobile handsets and service plans in approximately 100 of their locations across Canada. In addition, another significant network milestone has been achieved with the refarm of 10 MHz of AWS-1 spectrum now complete across Freedom Mobile’s footprint. The Company continues to actively roll out its 2500 and 700 MHz spectrum which further improves the network quality and will enable additional features such as VoLTE.\nIn the two years since we acquired our Wireless business, we have made significant investments and improvements to our network and our service. We are excited by the tremendous growth potential of this business, and, as shown by our results this quarter, we are committed to delivering a strong and competitive wireless alternative that will benefit all Canadians.\nWireline\nThe value of our Internet service is reflected in outstanding results – strong cumulative net gains in Internet subscribers over the last seven quarters. Continued investment in our extensive hybrid co-axial broadband network enables us to offer WideOpen Internet 150 across 99% of our Western Canadian cable footprint. We believe Canadians should not have limitations on how much they use the Internet – by offering our flagship WideOpen Internet 150 plan with unlimited data, we are providing customers peace of mind in knowing they can stream, download and browse without any overage charges for going over monthly data limits.\nIn a challenging Consumer Video environment, including a declining customer base and a general shift into lower priced video packages, Shaw’s BlueSky TV has helped moderate the impacts of the evolving cable video market. The launch of Shaw’s BlueSky TV in mid-2017 provided a new future for our cable video operations, delivering a new premium television product to Canadians. Powered by Comcast’s next generation X1 platform, Shaw BlueSky TV leverages the strength of our network to make this new television experience possible for our customers. Integrated with Netflix and featuring benefits like voice-controlled remote and advanced search, Shaw BlueSky TV has given customers an elevated video and entertainment experience.\nOn the shoulders of its Smart suite of products, Shaw Business continues to grow at a steady pace despite recent years of economic challenges experienced in parts of Western Canada. Highlighted by growth in the small and medium-sized business markets, the Business division continues to consistently increase its customer base, revenue and profitability. In December 2017, Shaw Business launched its fourth product under this portfolio - Smart Surveillance, a cloud-based security camera system which, when paired with Smart Security, provides the optimum level of physical security for small businesses.\nSelected financial and operational highlights\nEffective September 1, 2017, and as a result of the restructuring undertaken in fiscal 2017, the Company reorganized and integrated its management structure, previously separated in the Consumer and Business Network Services segments, into a combined Wireline segment, as management and costs became increasingly inseparable between the previously reported segments. There was no change to the Wireless operating segment.\nBasis of presentation\nOn August 1, 2017, the Company sold 100% of its wholly owned subsidiary ViaWest, Inc. (“ViaWest”), previously reported under the Business Infrastructure Services division, to an external party.\nOn May 31, 2017, the Company entered an agreement to sell a group of assets comprising the operations of Shaw Tracking, a fleet tracking operation reported within the Company’s Wireline segment, to an external party. The transaction closed on September 15, 2017.\nAccordingly, the operating results and operating cash flows for the previously reported Business Infrastructure Services division and the Shaw Tracking business (an operating segment within the Wireline division) are presented as discontinued operations separate from the Company’s continuing operations.

Internet net gains of approximately 5,500 RGUs in the current quarter were more than offset by Video, Phone and Satellite RGU losses. The Company continued its moderated promotions strategy, focused on higher value Internet and Video subscribers.\nIn Wireless, the Company continued to add wireless subscribers, gaining a net combined 89,702 postpaid and prepaid subscribers in the quarter. This represents an increase of more than 2.5 times the 33,427 net additions achieved in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in the customer base reflects customer demand for the iPhone, data-centric service plans and the ongoing execution of our Wireless growth strategy to improve the network and customer experience.\nOverview\nFor detailed discussion of divisional performance see “Discussion of operations.” Highlights of the consolidated second quarter financial results are as follows:\nRevenue\nRevenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 of $1.36 billion increased $149 million or 12.4% from $1.21 billion for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, highlighted by the following:\nThe year-over-year improvement in revenue was primarily due to growth in the Wireless division, contributing an incremental $149 million in revenue driven by higher postpaid RGUs (approximately 175,000 since February 28, 2017), an improvement to average revenue per unit (“ARPU”) and a large share of postpaid subscriber adds purchasing handsets, resulting in a $124 million increase in equipment revenue up from $24 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 to $148 million in the current quarter. The Business division contributed $7 million or 5.3% to the consolidated revenue improvements for the quarter driven primarily by customer growth. Consumer division revenue for the period decreased $7 million or 0.8% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017, mainly due to lower cable Video revenue driven by RGU losses and lower ARPU due to a change in Video customer mix. Cable Video revenue declines were partially offset by higher Internet revenues driven mostly by the addition of approximately 66,000 Internet RGUs since February 28, 2017 and rate increases introduced in each the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and the second quarter of fiscal 2018.\nCompared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, consolidated revenue for the quarter increased 8.5% or by $106 million. The increase in revenue over the prior quarter relates primarily to subscriber growth and handset sales in the Wireless division.\nRevenue for the six-month period of $2.60 billion increased $182 million or 0.8% from $2.42 billion for the comparable period in fiscal 2017.\nThe year-over-year improvement in revenue was primarily due to the Wireless division contributing revenues of $465 million, an increase of $186 million or 66.7% compared to the comparable six-month period of fiscal 2017. The Business division contributed $16 million or 6.1% to the consolidated revenue improvements for the six-month period driven primarily by customer growth. Consumer division revenues decreased $19 million or 1.0% compared to the comparable six-month period of fiscal 2017.\nOperating income before restructuring costs and amortization\nOperating income before restructuring costs and amortization for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 of $501 million decreased by $2 million or 0.4% from $503 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, highlighted by the following:\nThe year-over-year improvement in the Wireless division of $7 million was more than fully offset by the $9 million or 1.9% decrease in the Wireline division. The decline in the Wireline division related primarily to the change in Video customer mix, coupled with higher programming costs.\nOperating margin for the second quarter of 37.0% was down from 41.7% in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 due primarily to the impact of the lower Wireless operating margin of 12.4% as a result of the additional equipment sales in the quarter and the lower resulting upfront margin achieved on loading these RGUs.\nCompared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018 , operating income before restructuring costs and amortization for the current quarter was up $20 million related primarily to lower corporate related costs.\nFor the six-month period , operating income before restructuring costs and amortization of $982 million decreased $25 million or 2.5% from $1.0 billion for the comparable period.\nWireless operating income before restructuring costs and amortization for the six-month period increased $12 million or 20.3% over the comparable period fully offset by a decrease in the Wireline division of $37 million related primarily to the change in Video customer mix, coupled with higher programming costs.\nFree cash flow\nFree cash flow for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 of $135 million decreased $12 million from $147 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, mainly due to $19 million of higher planned capital expenditures.\nNet income (loss)\nNet loss of $164 million and $50 million for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018, respectively compared to net income of $147 million and $237 million for the same periods in fiscal 2017. The changes in net income are outlined in the following table.\nFebruary 28, 2018 net income compared to: Three months ended Six months ended (millions of Canadian dollars) November 30,\n2017 February 28,\n2017 February 28,\n2017 Increased (decreased) operating income before restructuring costs and amortization (1) 20 (2 ) (25 ) Decreased (increased) restructuring costs (417 ) (417 ) (405 ) Decreased (increased) amortization 5 (19 ) (51 ) Change in net other costs and revenue (2) (22 ) 15 133 Decreased (increased) income taxes 130 109 60 Increased income from discontinued operations, net of tax 6 3 1 (278 ) (311 ) (287 ) (1) See definitions and discussion under “Non-IFRS and additional GAAP measures.”\n(2) Net other costs include business acquisition costs, accretion of long-term liabilities and provisions, debt retirement costs, realized and unrealized foreign exchange differences and other losses as detailed in the unaudited Consolidated Statements of Income.\nRestructuring costs in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 of $417 million related to the TBT initiative. The costs relate mainly to severance and other employee costs attributable to the group of eligible employees who accepted the VDP package during the period, as well as other costs directly associated with the TBT initiative. See also “Introduction”, “Other Income and Expense Items”, “Caution Forward Looking Statements”, and “Risk and Uncertainty” in this MD&A for additional discussion of the TBT, the VDP and the risks and assumptions associated therewith.\nOutlook\nThe Company confirms that it remains on track to meet its fiscal 2018 guidance which includes consolidated operating income before restructuring costs and amortization growing to approximately $2.1 billion – an increase of approximately 5% over fiscal 2017; capital investments of approximately $1.38 billion; and free cash flow of approximately $375 million. Shaw’s guidance confirmation includes assumptions related to cost reductions that will be achieved through the TBT initiative (specifically the VDP); roaming cost reductions of approximately $12 million expected to be realized in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 associated with the CRTC finalizing wholesale mobile wireless roaming rates; and short-term incremental costs associated with growth in Wireless handset sales.\nSee “Caution concerning forward-looking statements.”\nNon-IFRS and additional GAAP measures\nThe Company’s continuous disclosure documents may provide discussion and analysis of non-IFRS financial measures. These financial measures do not have standard definitions prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies. The Company’s continuous disclosure documents may also provide discussion and analysis of additional GAAP measures. Additional GAAP measures include line items, headings, and sub-totals included in the financial statements.\nThe Company utilizes these measures in making operating decisions and assessing its performance. Certain investors, analysts and others utilize these measures in assessing the Company’s operational and financial performance and as an indicator of its ability to service debt and return cash to shareholders. The non-IFRS financial measures and additional GAAP measures have not been presented as an alternative to net income or any other measure of performance required by IFRS.\nBelow is a discussion of the non-IFRS financial measures and additional GAAP measures used by the Company and provides a reconciliation to the nearest IFRS measure or provides a reference to such reconciliation.\nOperating income before restructuring costs and amortization\nOperating income before restructuring costs and amortization is calculated as revenue less operating, general and administrative expenses. It is intended to indicate the Company’s ongoing ability to service and/or incur debt and is therefore calculated before one-time items such as restructuring costs, amortization (a non-cash expense) and interest. Operating income before restructuring costs and amortization is also one of the measures used by the investing community to value the business.\nThree months ended February 28, Six months ended February 28, (millions of Canadian dollars) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Operating income from continuing operations (167 ) 270 58 538 Add back (deduct): Restructuring costs 417 - 417 12 Amortization: Deferred equipment revenue (8 ) (10 ) (17 ) (20 ) Deferred equipment costs 28 30 58 61 Property, plant and equipment, intangibles and other 231 213 466 416 Operating income before restructuring costs and amortization 501 503 982 1,007 Operating margin\nOperating margin is calculated by dividing operating income before restructuring costs and amortization by revenue.\nThree months ended February 28, Six months ended February 28, 2018 2017 Change % 2018 2017 Change % Wireline 43.6 % 44.5 % (0.9pts) 42.6 % 44.2 % (1.6pts) Wireless 12.4 % 20.6 % (8.2pts) 15.3 % 21.2 % (5.9pts) Combined Wireline and Wireless 37.0 % 41.7 % (4.7pts) 37.7 % 41.6 % (3.9pts) Income from discontinued operations before restructuring costs, amortization, taxes and other non-operating items\nIncome from discontinued operations before restructuring costs, amortization, taxes and other non-operating items is calculated as revenue less operating, general and administrative expenses from discontinued operations.

Free cash flow is calculated as free cash flow from continuing operations and free cash flow from discontinued operations.\nFree cash flow from continuing operations is comprised of operating income before restructuring costs and amortization, adding dividends from equity accounted associates, changes in receivable related balances with respect to customer equipment financing transactions as a cash item and deducting capital expenditures (on an accrual basis and net of proceeds on capital dispositions) and equipment costs (net), interest, cash taxes paid or payable, dividends paid on the preferred shares, recurring cash funding of pension amounts net of pension expense and adjusted to exclude share-based compensation expense.\nFree cash flow from continuing operations has not been reported on a segmented basis. Certain components of free cash flow from continuing operations, including operating income before restructuring costs and amortization continue to be reported on a segmented basis. Capital expenditures and equipment costs (net) are also reported on a segmented basis. Other items, including interest and cash taxes, are not generally directly attributable to a segment, and are reported on a consolidated basis.\nFree cash flow from discontinued operations is comprised of income from discontinued operations before restructuring costs, amortization, taxes and other non-operating items after deducting capital expenditures (on an accrual basis and net of proceeds on capital dispositions), interest and cash taxes paid or payable that are included in the income from discontinued operations before restructuring costs, amortization, taxes and other non-operating items.\nFree cash flow is calculated as follows:\nThree months ended February 28, Six months ended February 28, (millions of Canadian dollars) 2018 2017 Change % 2018 2017 Change % Revenue Consumer 926 933 (0.8 ) 1,861 1,880 (1.0 ) Business 140 133 5.3 280 264 6.1 Wireline 1,066 1,066 - 2,141 2,144 (0.1 ) Service 142 117 21.4 273 234 16.7 Equipment 148 24 >100.0 192 45 >100.0 Wireless 290 141 >100.0 465 279 66.7 1,356 1,207 12.4 2,606 2,423 7.6 Intersegment eliminations (1 ) (1 ) - (2 ) (1 ) 100.0 1,355 1,206 12.4 2,604 2,422 7.5 Operating income before restructuring costs and amortization (1) Wireline 465 474 (1.9 ) 911 948 (3.9 ) Wireless 36 29 24.1 71 59 20.3 501 503 (0.4 ) 982 1,007 (2.5 ) Capital expenditures and equipment costs (net): (2) Wireline 232 216 7.4 468 420 11.4 Wireless 56 53 5.7 173 118 46.6 288 269 7.1 641 538 19.2 Free cash flow before the following 213 234 (9.0 ) 341 469 (27.3 ) Less: Interest (63 ) (68 ) (7.4 ) (123 ) (134 ) (8.2 ) Cash taxes (43 ) (40 ) 7.5 (87 ) (81 ) 7.4 Other adjustments: Dividends from equity accounted associates 23 22 4.6 46 43 7.0 Non-cash share-based compensation 1 1 - 2 2 - Pension adjustment 4 1 >100.0 8 4 100.0 Customer equipment financing 2 1 100.0 4 4 - Preferred share dividends (2 ) (2 ) - (4 ) (4 ) - Free cash flow from continuing operations 135 149 (9.4 ) 187 303 (38.3 ) Income from discontinued operations before restructuring costs, amortization taxes and other non-operating items - 38 (100.0 ) - 72 (100.0 ) Less: Capital expenditures - (29 ) (100.0 ) - (49 ) (100.0 ) Interest - (9 ) (100.0 ) - (18 ) (100.0 ) Cash taxes - (2 ) (100.0 ) - (3 ) (100.0 ) Free cash flow from discontinued operations - (2 ) (100.0 ) - 2 (100.0 ) Free cash flow 135 147 (8.2 ) 187 305 (38.7 ) (1) See definitions and discussion under “Non-IFRS and additional GAAP measures.”\n(2) Per Note 4 to the unaudited interim Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet debt leverage ratio\nThe Company uses this ratio to determine its optimal leverage ratio.

RGU disconnects were driven primarily by the Company’s continued moderated promotions strategy, focused on higher value internet and Video subscribers.\nRevenue highlights include:\nConsumer revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased by $7 million or 0.8% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Higher revenue generated by January Internet rate adjustments and incremental Internet RGUs were fully offset by the impact of reductions to cable Video, Phone and Satellite video RGUs, as well as customer downward migration in video packages relative to a year ago. As compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the current quarter revenue decreased by $9 million or 1.0%. Business revenue of $140 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was up $7 million or 5.3% over the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Growth was led by the continued success of selling the Smart suite of products, specifically Smart WiFi and Smart Voice, as well as traditional Internet, Video and data services. As compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the current quarter revenue was flat at $140 million.\nOperating income before restructuring costs and amortization highlights include:\nOperating income before restructuring costs and amortization for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 of $465 million was down 1.9% or $9 million from $474 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The decline related primarily to customer downward migration in video packages coupled with higher programming costs. As compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, Wireline operating income before restructuring costs and amortization for the current quarter increased by $19 million.\nWireless\nThree months ended February 28, Six months ended February 28, (millions of Canadian dollars) 2018 2017 Change % 2018 2017 Change % Service 142 117 21.4 273 234 16.7 Equipment and other 148 24 >100.0 192 45 >100.0 Wireless revenue 290 141 >100.0 465 279 66.7 Operating income before restructuring costs and amortization (1) 36 29 24.1 71 59 20.3 Operating margin (1) 12.4 % 20.6 % (8.2pts) 15.3 % 21.2 % (5.9pts) (1) See definitions and discussion under “Non-IFRS and additional GAAP measures.”\nThe Wireless division added 89,702 RGUs in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to 33,427 RGUs gained in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in the customer base reflects customer demand for the iPhone, data-centric service plans and the ongoing execution of our Wireless growth strategy to improve the network and customer experience.\nRevenue highlights include:\nRevenue of $290 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was up $149 million or 105.7% over the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by year-over-year growth in both handset and service revenue. Service revenue grew as a result of increased postpaid and prepaid RGUs, and improved ARPU of $38.43 as compared to $36.44 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. As compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the current quarter revenue increased $115 million or 65.7% and ARPU increased by $0.91 or 2.4%.\nOperating income before restructuring costs and amortization highlights include:\nOperating income before restructuring costs and amortization of $36 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 improved by $7 million or 24.1% over the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The improvements were driven primarily by increased revenue offset partially by an increase in distribution and handset costs associated with the increased loading of new customers in the quarter. As compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2018, operating income before restructuring costs and amortization for the current quarter increased $1 million or 2.9%.\nCapital expenditures and equipment costs\nThree months ended February 28, Six months ended February 28, (millions of Canadian dollars) 2018 2017 Change % 2018 2017 Change % Wireline New housing development 29 25 16.0 58 47 23.4 Success based 70 60 16.7 163 141 15.6 Upgrades and enhancements 104 103 1.0 197 174 13.2 Replacement 6 7 (14.3 ) 13 13 - Building and other 23 21 9.5 37 45 (17.8 ) Total as per Note 4 to the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements 232 216 7.4 468 420 11.4 Wireless Total as per Note 4 to the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements 56 53 5.7 173 118 46.6 Consolidated total as per Note 4 to the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements 288 269 7.1 641 538 19.2 In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, capital investment from continuing operations was $288 million, a $19 million or 7% increase over the comparable period in fiscal 2017, driven by added capital expenditures of $10 million in success-based equipment, $3 million in the Wireless division, $4 million in growth and upgrades related to residential and business customers and $1 million in Wireline network infrastructure and broadband capacity expansion.\nWireline highlights include:\nSuccess based capital for the quarter of $70 million was $10 million higher than in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The increase was driven by Video equipment costs from BlueSky TV activations. Investment in new housing development was $29 million, a $4 million or 16% increase over the comparable period, driven by residential and commercial customer network growth and acquisition.\nWireless highlights include:\nCapital investment of $56 million in the second quarter was related primarily to continued investment in our network infrastructure and refarming of AWS-1 spectrum, specifically the LTE-Advanced network rollout project as well as back office system upgrades.\nDiscontinued operations\nShaw Tracking\nOn May 31, 2017, the Company entered an agreement to sell a group of assets comprising the operations of Shaw Tracking, a fleet tracking operation reported within the Company’s Business Network Services segment. The Company determined that the assets and liabilities of the Shaw Tracking business met the criteria to be classified as a disposal group held for sale. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the Shaw Tracking business were classified in the consolidated statement of financial position at August 31, 2017 as current assets held for sale or current liabilities held for sale, respectively, as the sale of these assets and liabilities was expected to be completed within one year. In addition, the operating results and operating cash flows of the business are presented as discontinued operations separate from the Company’s continuing operations.

See “Other income and expense items” for further details on non-operating items.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2018, net income decreased $367 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 mainly due to the $330 million gain on divestiture, net of tax, of ViaWest, as well as an $11 million non-operating provision recovery in the prior quarter.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, net income increased $348 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017 mainly due to the gain on divestiture, net of tax, of ViaWest, and lower current quarter restructuring costs. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in operating income before restructuring costs and amortization, higher amortization, lower equity income from our investment in Corus and higher income taxes. Net other costs and revenue changed primarily due to a $14 million decrease in income from an equity accounted associate and an $11 million provision reversal related to the wind down of shomi in the quarter.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2017, net income decreased $14 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 mainly due to current quarter restructuring costs and losses on discontinued operations, net of tax, as well as increased amortization. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in operating income before restructuring costs and amortization and lower income taxes. Net other costs and revenue changed primarily due to a $16 million increase in income from an equity accounted associate and a $15 million provision reversal related to the wind down of shomi in the quarter.\nIn the second quarter of fiscal 2017, net income increased $58 million compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017 mainly due to a non-recurring provision related to the wind down of shomi operations recorded in the first quarter, partially offset by an increase in amortization and income taxes. Also contributing to the increased net income were lower restructuring costs, partially offset by lower equity income from our investment in Corus. Net other costs and revenue changed primarily due to a provision of $107 million recorded in the prior quarter relating to shomi operations partially offset by a $17 million decrease in income from an equity accounted associate in the quarter.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2017, net income decreased $65 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 mainly due to a non-recurring provision related to the wind down of shomi operations included in net other costs and revenue for the current quarter. Also contributing to the decreased net income was lower operating income before restructuring costs and amortization, higher restructuring charges and lower income from discontinued operations, partially offset by lower income taxes. Net other costs and revenue changed primarily due to a $107 million impairment of the Company’s joint venture investment in shomi and a $27 million increase in income from an equity accounted associate in the quarter.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 net income decreased $550 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2016 mainly due to lower income from discontinued operations, net of tax, relating primarily to the gain on the divestiture of the former Media division recorded in the third quarter, decreased operating income before restructuring costs and amortization, and higher income taxes. Partly offsetting the decrease in net income were decreases in net other costs and revenue and restructuring costs. Net other costs and revenue changed primarily due to non-recurring charges recorded in the third quarter, including a $54 million impairment of the Company’s joint venture investment in shomi, a $20 million write-down of a private portfolio investment, $12 million in acquisition related costs and a $10 million loss from an equity accounted associate.\nNet income for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 increased $540 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016 mainly due to higher income from discontinued operations, net of tax, relating primarily to the gain on the divestiture of the former Media division, increased operating income before restructuring costs and amortization and lower income taxes. Partly offsetting the net income improvement in the quarter were: i) decreased net other costs and revenue; ii) increased restructuring charges; and iii) increased amortization. Net other costs and revenue changed primarily due to a $54 million impairment of the Company’s shomi joint venture investment, a $20 million write-down of a private portfolio investment and a $10 million loss from an equity accounted associate.\nOther income and expense items\nRestructuring costs\nRestructuring costs generally include severance, employee related costs and other costs directly associated with a restructuring program. For the three- and six-month periods ended February 28, 2018 the category included a $417 million restructuring charge related to the Company’s TBT initiative. As a first step in the TBT, the VDP was offered to eligible employees. The outcome of the program had approximately 3,300 Shaw employees accepting the VDP package, representing approximately 25% of all employees. The costs related to this program make up the majority of the restructuring costs recorded in the period. See “Introduction” for further details on the TBT and the VDP.\nAmortization\nThree months ended February 28, Six months ended February 28, (millions of Canadian dollars) 2018 2017 Change % 2018 2017 Change % Amortization revenue (expense) Deferred equipment revenue 8 10 (20.0 ) 17 20 (15.0 ) Deferred equipment costs (28 ) (30 ) (6.7 ) (58 ) (61 ) (4.9 ) Property, plant and equipment, intangibles and other (231 ) (213 ) 8.5 (466 ) (416 ) 12.0 Amortization of property, plant and equipment, intangibles and other increased 8.5% and 12.0% for the three and six months ended February 28, 2018 over the comparable periods due to amortization of new expenditures exceeding the amortization of assets that became fully amortized during the period.\nAmortization of financing costs and Interest expense\nThree months ended February 28, Six months ended February 28, (millions of Canadian dollars) 2018 2017 Change % 2018 2017 Change % Amortization of financing costs – long-term debt 1 - 100.0 2 1 100.0 Interest expense 63 69 (8.7 ) 124 135 (8.2 ) Interest expense for the three and six-month periods ended February 28, 2018 was lower than the comparable periods due to lower average outstanding debt balances in the current year. (See note 9 of the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for further detail.)\nEquity income (loss) of an associate or joint venture\nFor the three and six-month periods ended February 28, 2018 the Company recorded equity income of $16 million and $46 million, respectively, related to its interest in Corus, compared to equity income of $9 million and $36 million for the comparable periods.\nOther gains/losses\nThis category generally includes realized and unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on U.S. dollar denominated current assets and liabilities, gains and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment and minor investments, and the Company’s share of the operations of Burrard Landing Lot 2 Holdings Partnership. For the prior year six-month period ended February 28, 2017, the category included a $107 million provision in respect of the Company’s investment in shomi, which discontinued operations in fiscal 2017.\nIncome taxes\nIncome taxes are lower in the quarter compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2017 mainly due to a net loss from continuing operations driven mainly by $417 million restructuring costs incurred in the quarter. See “Introduction” for further details on the TBT and the VDP.\nFinancial position\nTotal assets were $14.3 billion at February 28, 2018 compared to $14.4 billion at August 31, 2017. The following is a discussion of significant changes in the consolidated statement of financial position since August 31, 2017.\nCurrent assets decreased $223 million due to decreases in cash of $229 million, accounts receivable of $32 million, and assets held for sale of $61 million partially offset by increases in inventories of $24 million and other current assets of $75 million. Cash decreased as the funds provided by operations were exceeded by cash outlays for investing and financing activities. Accounts receivable decreased primarily due to the receipt of a commodity tax refund relating to the purchase of spectrum licenses made by Freedom Mobile in fiscal 2017. Assets held for sale as at August 31, 2017 included the assets of the Shaw Tracking business, which was sold on September 15, 2017.\nOther current assets increased over the period mainly due to a significant increase in Wireless subscribers participating in both the Company’s MyTab plan, a discretionary wireless handset discount plan and MyTab Boost, a plan that allows our customers to pay less for their handset upfront if they pay a predetermined incremental charge on a monthly basis. The significant growth in handset sales was primarily related to the introduction of the iPhone to the Company’s handset lineup.\nInvestments and other assets increased by $10 million primarily due to equity income and other comprehensive income of associates related to the Company’s investment in Corus. Property, plant and equipment increased $132 million due to capital investments in excess of amortization.\nCurrent liabilities increased $31 million during the period due to an increase in provisions of $207 million, partially offset by decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $58 million, income taxes payable of $76 million, and liabilities held for sale of $39 million. The increase in current provisions was mainly due to the restructuring costs related to TBT. In connection with the VDP, the Company recorded $417 million restructuring charge primarily related to severance and other related costs, of which $203 million is included in current provisions and $198 million is included in long-term provisions. Income taxes payable decreased due to normal course tax installment payments, partially offset by the current period provision. Accounts payable and accruals decreased due to the timing of payment and fluctuations in various payables including capital expenditures and network fees. Liabilities held for sale as at August 31, 2017 included the liabilities of the Shaw Tracking business, which was sold on September 15, 2017.\nLong-term debt increased $10 million due to an increase in the Burrard Landing Lot 2 Holdings Partnership mortgage. The additional loan matures on November 1, 2024 and bears interest at 4.14% compounded semi-annually.\nOther long-term liabilities decreased $84 million during the quarter primarily due to a remeasurement of the Company’s defined benefit plan related to the effect of experience adjustments due to changes in demographic assumptions. The cost and related accrued benefit obligation of the Company’s non-registered pension plans are determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuations involve estimates and actuarial assumptions including discount rates and rate of compensation increase (financial assumptions) as well as mortality rates and retirement rates (demographic assumptions). Due to the long-term nature of the non-registered pension plans, such estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. Remeasurements related to the effect of experience adjustments arise when the non-registered pension plans’ experience differs from the experience expected using the actuarial assumptions, such as mortality and retirement rates.\nShareholders’ equity decreased $144 million due to a decrease in retained earnings of $351 million and contributed surplus of $2 million, which was offset by an increase in share capital of $137 million and accumulated other comprehensive income of $73 million. Share capital increased due to the issuance of 5,055,652 Class B non-voting participating shares (“Class B Non-Voting Shares”) under the Company’s option plan and Dividend Reinvestment Plan (“DRIP”). Retained earnings decreased due to dividends of $301 million and current year loss of $50 million. Accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased due to the re-measurement recorded on employee benefit plans and a change in unrealized fair value of derivatives.\nAs at March 31, 2018, there were 480,180,535 Class B Non-Voting Shares, 10,012,393 Series A Shares, 1,987,607 Series B Shares and 22,420,064 Class A Shares issued and outstanding. As at March 31, 2018, 10,395,580 Class B Non-Voting Shares were issuable on exercise of outstanding options. Shaw is traded on the Toronto and New York stock exchanges and is included in the S&P/TSX 60 Index (Trading Symbols: TSX – SJR.B, SJR.PR.A, SJR.PR.B, NYSE – SJR, and TSXV – SJR.A). For more information, please visit www.shaw.ca .\nLiquidity and capital resources\nIn the six-month period ended February 28, 2018, the Company generated $187 million of free cash flow. Shaw used its free cash flow along with proceeds on issuance of Class B Non-Voting Shares of $27 million, proceeds from the sale of the Shaw Tracking business of $18 million, and cash on hand to pay common share dividends of $190 million, and fund the net working capital change of $247 million.\nAs at February 28, 2018, the Company had $278 million of cash on hand and its $1.5 billion fully undrawn bank credit facility. The facility is used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nAs at February 28, 2018, the net debt leverage ratio for the Company is 2.0x, which is up slightly from 1.9x as at August 31, 2017. Having regard to prevailing competitive, operational and capital market conditions, the Board of Directors has determined that having this ratio in the range of 2.0 to 2.5x would be optimal leverage for the Company in the current environment. Should the ratio fall below this, other than on a temporary basis, the Board may choose to recapitalize back into this optimal range. The Board may also determine to increase the Company’s debt above these levels to finance specific strategic opportunities such as a significant acquisition or repurchase of Class B Non-Voting Participating Shares in the event that pricing levels were to drop precipitously.\nThe Company calculates net debt leverage ratio as follows 1 :\n(millions of Canadian dollars) February 28, 2018 August 31, 2017 Current portion of Long-Term Debt 1 2 Long-Term Debt 4,311 4,298 50% of Outstanding Preferred Shares 147 147 Cash (278 ) (507 ) (A) Net Debt 2 4,181 3,940 Operating income before restructuring costs and amortization 2,011 1,997 Corus Dividends 91 88 (B) Adjusted operating income before restructuring costs and amortization 2 2,102 2,085 (A/B) Net debt leverage ratio 2.0x 1.9x (1) The following contains a description of the Company’s use of non-IFRS financial measures provides a reconciliation to the nearest IFRS measure or provides a reference to such reconciliation.\n(2) These financial measures do not have standard definitions prescribed by IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies and have not been presented as an alternative to liquidity prescribed by IFRS.\nThe Company issued Class B Non-Voting Shares from treasury under its DRIP which resulted in cash savings and incremental Class B Non-Voting Shares of $54 million and $106 million, during the three and six months periods ending February 28, 2018, respectively.\nShaw’s credit facilities are subject to customary covenants which include maintaining minimum or maximum financial ratios.\nCovenant Limit Shaw Credit Facilities Total Debt to Operating Cash Flow (1) Ratio < 5.00:1 Operating Cash Flow (1) to Fixed Charges (2) Ratio > 2.00:1 (1) Operating Cash Flow, for the purposes of the covenants, is calculated as net earnings before interest expense, depreciation, amortization and current and deferred income taxes, excluding profit or loss from investments accounted for on an equity basis, for the most recently completed fiscal quarter multiplied by four, plus cash dividends and other cash distributions received in the most recently completed four fiscal quarters from investments accounted for on an equity basis.\n(2) Fixed Charges are defined as the aggregate interest expense for the most recently completed fiscal quarter multiplied by four.\nAs at February 28, 2018, Shaw is in compliance with these covenants and based on current business plans, the Company is not aware of any condition or event that would give rise to non-compliance with the covenants over the life of the borrowings.\nBased on the aforementioned financing activities, available credit facilities and forecasted free cash flow, the Company expects to have sufficient liquidity to fund operations, obligations, working capital requirements, including maturing debt, during the upcoming fiscal year. On a longer-term basis, Shaw expects to generate free cash flow and have borrowing capacity sufficient to finance foreseeable future business plans and refinance maturing debt.\nCash Flow from Operations\nOperating Activities\nThree months ended February 28, Six months ended February 28, (millions of Canadian dollars) 2018 2017 Change % 2018 2017 Change % Funds flow from continuing operations (26) 397 (>100.0) 358 786 (54.5) Net change in non-cash balances related to operations 229 25 >100.0 212 (112 ) >100.0 Operating activities of discontinued operations - 23 (100.0) (2 ) 34 (>100.0) 203 445 (54.4) 568 708 (19.8) For the three months ended February 28, 2018, funds flow from operating activities decreased over the comparable period in fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower net income from continuing operations, which was partially offset by an increase in net change in non-cash balances related to operations. The net change in non-cash balances related to operations fluctuated over the comparative period due to changes in accounts receivable and other current asset balances, and the timing of payment of current income taxes payable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\nInvesting Activities\nThree months ended February 28, Six months ended February 28, (millions of Canadian dollars) 2018 2017 Decrease 2018 2017 Decrease Cash flow used in investing activities (290 ) (344 ) 54 (640 ) (645 ) 5 For the three months ended February 28, 2018, the cash used in investing activities decreased over the comparable period in fiscal 2018 due primarily to lower investing activities of discontinued operations, as well as higher equity income of an associate as compared to the prior year. This was slightly offset by higher cash outlays for inventory, capital and intangible expenditures during the three months ended February 28, 2018.\nFinancing Activities\nThe changes in financing activities during the comparative periods were as follows:\nThree months ended February 28, Six months ended February 28, (millions of Canadian dollars) 2018 2017 2018 2017 Bank loans – net borrowings (repayments) 10 299 10 298 Bank facility arrangement costs - (3 ) - (3 ) Dividends (96 ) (97 ) (194 ) (195 ) Issuance of Class B Non-Voting Shares 6 27 27 30 Financing activities of discontinued operations - 4 - 22 (80 ) 230 (157 ) 152 Capital Resources\nThere has been no material change in the Company’s capital resources, including commitments for capital expenditures, between August 31, 2017 and February 28, 2018.\nAccounting standards\nThe MD&A included in the Company’s August 31, 2017 Annual Report outlined critical accounting policies, including key estimates and assumptions that management has made under these policies, and how they affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The MD&A also describes significant accounting policies where alternatives exist. See “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in the Company’s Management Discussion and Analysis for the year ended August 31, 2017. The condensed interim consolidated financial statements follow the same accounting policies and methods of application as the most recent annual consolidated financial statements except as described below.\nStandards and amendments to standards issued but not yet effective\nThe Company has not yet adopted certain standards and amendments that have been issued but are not yet effective. The following pronouncements are being assessed to determine their impact on the Company’s results and financial position.\nIFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers , was issued in May 2014 and replaces IAS 11 Construction Contracts , IAS 18 Revenue , IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programs , IFRIC 15 Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate , IFRIC 18 Transfers of Assets from Customers and SIC-31 Revenue—Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services . The new standard requires revenue to be recognized in a manner that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services. The principles are to be applied in the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nThe application of IFRS 15 will impact the Company’s reported results, including the classification and timing of revenue recognition and the treatment of costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers. IFRS 15 requires the estimation of total consideration to be received over the contract term at contract inception, and the allocation of that consideration to performance obligations in the contract, typically based on the relative stand-alone selling price of each obligation. IFRS 15 also requires that incremental costs to obtain a contract with a customer (for example, commissions) be capitalized and amortized into operating expenses over time. The Company currently expenses such costs as incurred.\nThe Company’s financial position will also be impacted by the adoption of IFRS 15, with new contract asset and contract liability categories recognized to reflect differences between the timing of revenue recognition and the actual billing of those goods and services to customers. While similar differences are recognized currently, IFRS 15 introduces additional requirements and disclosures specific to contracts with customers.\nShaw continues to evaluate the impacts of IFRS 15 and preparations are underway for the adoption of the new standard. Initial planning and scoping efforts were conducted during fiscal 2017, with ongoing development of the required accounting policies, significant judgments and estimates, processes, information systems and internal controls expected to continue throughout the Company’s 2018 fiscal year. In connection with these development efforts, the Company also expects a significant historical data gathering initiative will be required to identify and account for multi-year contracts with customers at the date of adoption. At this stage in the Company’s IFRS 15 implementation process, it is not possible to make reasonable quantitative estimates of the effects of the new standard. We expect to continue our testing and data gathering initiative through the end of fiscal 2018 and to disclose the estimated financial impacts of the impact of IFRS 15 in our 2018 annual report.\nThe new standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, which for the Company will be the annual period commencing September 1, 2018 and must be applied either retrospectively or on a modified retrospective basis for all contracts that are not complete as at that date. The Company continues to evaluate the adoption approach in conjunction with its assessment of the expected impacts of adoption. IFRS 16 Leases requires entities to recognize lease assets and lease obligations on the balance sheet. For lessees, IFRS 16 removes the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases, effectively treating all leases as finance leases. Certain short-term leases (less than 12 months) and leases of low-value are exempt from the requirements and may continue to be treated as operating leases. Lessors will continue with a dual lease classification model. Classification will determine how and when a lessor will recognize lease revenue, and what assets would be recorded.\nAs the Company has significant contractual obligations currently being recognized as operating leases, we anticipate that the application of IFRS 16 will result in a material increase to both assets and liabilities and material changes to the timing of the recognition of expenses associated with the lease arrangements although at this stage in the Company’s IFRS 16 implementation process, it is not possible to make reasonable quantitative estimates of the effects of the new standard.\nThe standard may be applied retroactively or using a modified retrospective approach for annual periods commencing January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted if IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers has been adopted. The Company will evaluate the adoption approach in conjunction with its assessment of the expected impacts of adoption.\nChange in accounting policy\nIn September 2017, the IFRS Interpretations Committee (“the Committee”) published a summary of its agenda decision regarding accounting for interest and penalties related to income taxes, which is not specifically addressed by IFRS Standards. Although the Committee decided not to add this issue to its standard-setting agenda, the Committee noted if an entity considers a particular amount payable or receivable for interest and penalties to be an income tax, then the entity applies IAS 12 Income Taxes to that amount. If an entity does not apply IAS 12 to a particular amount payable or receivable for interest and penalties, it applies IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets . As such, the Company retrospectively changed its accounting policy for the accounting of interest and penalties related to income taxes to be in line with the Committee decision. The change of accounting policy did not have a significant impact on the previously reported consolidated financial statements.\nRelated party transactions\nThe Company’s transactions with related parties are discussed in its Management’s Discussion and Analysis for the year ended August 31, 2017 under “Related Party Transactions” and under Note 27 of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended August 31, 2017. There has been no material change in the Company’s transactions with related parties between August 31, 2017 and February 28, 2018.\nFinancial instruments\nThere has been no material change in the Company’s risk management practices with respect to financial instruments between August 31, 2017 and February 28, 2018. See “Known Events, Trends, Risks and Uncertainties – Interest Rates, Foreign Exchange Rates and Capital Markets” in the Company’s Management’s Discussion and Analysis for the year ended August 31, 2017 and the section entitled “Risk Management” under Note 28 of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended August 31, 2017.\nRisks and uncertainties\nIn the quarter, the Company introduced TBT, a multi-year initiative designed to reinvent Shaw’s operating model to better meet the changing tastes and expectations of consumers and businesses by reducing staff, optimizing the use of resources, and maintaining and ultimately improving customer service. Three key elements of TBT are to: 1) shift customer interactions to digital platforms; 2) drive more self-install and self-serve; and, 3) streamline the organization that builds and services our network. As part of the TBT initiative, the Company also plans to reduce input costs, consolidate functions, and streamline processes, which is expected to create operational improvements across the business allowing it to evolve into a more efficient organization.\nThere is an overall risk that the TBT initiative may not be completed in a timely and cost-effective manner to yield the expected results and benefits or result in a leaner, more integrated and agile company with improved efficiencies and execution to better meet its consumers needs and expectations (including the products and services offered to its customers). Specifically, there is a risk that the Company may not be able to: (i) establish and continue to upgrade a digital platform that will effectively engage customers digitally; (ii) successfully adopt a digital platform that will yield the expected results and benefits, including maintaining the quality of customer service, protecting the security of customer information, and coordinating the delivery of product and service offerings; (iii) deploy programs that will result in customers using the self-serve functions and electing to self-install the Company’s products and services; and (iv) consolidate and streamline the functions and processes of the divisions responsible for building and servicing its networks. The realization of any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on Shaw, its operations and/or financial results.\nAs a first step in the TBT, the VDP was offered to eligible employees. The outcome of the program had approximately 3,300 Shaw employees accepting the VDP package representing approximately 25% of all employees. As part of the program design, the majority of customer-facing employees (i.e., Customer Care, Retail, Sales) were not eligible to participate in the VDP. A large portion of employees who elected to participate in the VDP are in functions that will be addressed through the aforementioned key elements of the TBT and Shaw has control over the timing of employee departures across the Company through an actively managed, orderly transition over the next 18 months. In select functions, the Company determined that some employees will transition over a 24-month period, an extension from the 18-month period initially expected. Approximately 1,200 employees will be exiting before the end of fiscal 2018. For a detailed discussion of the restructuring charge, anticipated annual cost reduction, and VDP related cost reductions in fiscal 2018, see “Introduction.”\nWith approximately 3,300 employees accepting the VDP package, there is a risk that the Company may not be able to: (i) complete the employee exits with minimal impact on business operations within the anticipated timeframes and for the budgeted amounts, (ii) replace or outsource the functions performed by certain key employees that have accepted the VDP package in a manner that aligns with customer expectations which may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business operations, (iii) continue to operate the business in the normal course, and maintain or improve customer services, (iv) maintain employee morale as a result of the organizational changes, staff and cost reductions; (v) ensure that the staff reductions will reduce costs, and achieve the financial goals, cost competitiveness and profitability required to be attractive to investors. In addition, there can be no assurance that restructuring costs of the VDP will be limited to the budgeted amounts or that the expected annualized cost reductions from the VDP (including reductions in operating and capital expenditures), and the VDP related cost reductions in fiscal 2018 will be realized within the expected time frames or at all. The realization of any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on Shaw, its operations and/or financial results.\nOther significant risks and uncertainties affecting the Company and its business are discussed in the Company’s MD&A for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2017 under “Known Events, Trends, Risks and Uncertainties”.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION\n(unaudited)\n(millions of Canadian dollars) February 28, 2018\nAugust 31, 2017 ASSETS Current Cash 278 507 Accounts receivable 254 286 Inventories 133 109 Other current assets [note 5] 230 155 Assets held for sale [note 3] -
