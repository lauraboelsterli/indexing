    "text": "There's an in-house babysitting service for employees of one of Japan's largest staffing and talent agencies.\nIt's not just a perk: It's essential for helping working mothers make an easier transition back into the workforce.\nThat's because the country has a perennial shortage of child care services. It's so bad that even if a woman wants to return to work after giving birth, she often can't until the next April when day care facilities admit new children, according to Scott Sato, president and chief operating officer at Pasona.\n\"To address this, what we did was we have an in-house child care facility,\" he told CNBC. \"We were the first organization in Japan, or a public company, to have a babysitting facility in Japan.\"\nSato explained that there aren't enough \"baby care teachers\" in the country at the moment. The job applicant ratio is skewed such that there are about six jobs available per candidate, he said.\nA ",
