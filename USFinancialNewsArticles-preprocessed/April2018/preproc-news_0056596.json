An advertisement promotes Tesla Autopilot at a showroom of U.S. car manufacturer Tesla in Zurich, Switzerland March 28, 2018. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann\nKeller, Tesla’s vice president of Autopilot and low-voltage hardware, will be succeeded by Pete Bannon, a Tesla executive who previously oversaw chip development at Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ), a Tesla spokeswoman said via email on Thursday.\nKeller will join Intel as a senior vice president to lead silicon engineering, the chipmaker said separately on Thursday, confirming a Wall Street Journal report.\nTesla’s spokeswoman also said Andrej Karpathy, the company’s director of artificial intelligence and Autopilot vision, will now have overall responsibility for all Autopilot software.\nAutopilot made headlines last month after a fatal car crash in California in which the semi-autonomous driving system was in use.\nEarlier this month, Tesla withdrew as a formal party to the National Transportation Safety Board’s (NTSB) probe into the March 23 crash.\nDriver Walter Huang’s death in the crash and vehicle fire in a Tesla Model X prompted investigations by the NTSB and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
