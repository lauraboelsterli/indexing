    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian investigators said on Wednesday they have opened a criminal case into a fire at a shopping mall in eastern Moscow that killed one person earlier in the day.\nThe investigating committee said it would look into whether the fire at the four-storey ‘Perseus for Children’ shopping mall, which sells children’s goods, had been caused by negligence.\nIn March, a total of 64 people, mostly children, were killed in a fire at a Siberian shopping mall.\nWriting by Polina Ivanova; Editing by Hugh Lawson\n ",
