Related Coverage Wenger will be 'surprised' if he remains in Premier League\n“But enough to finish second, to be stable to win some trophies to reach some finals but we need to do more,” he added.\nWenger, who will leave Arsenal at the end of this season, has not tasted victory at United for 10 years and has never won away against a Mourinho team in the Premier League.\nThe Frenchman, who clinched the league and Cup double at Old Trafford in 2002, was centre stage before the game as he was presented with a gift by former United manager Alex Ferguson and Mourinho, and he was warmly applauded by the crowd.

YOUNGEST SIDE\nIt was the youngest side put out for a Premier League game by Wenger in nearly seven years but with the Europa League offering the only chance of Champions League football for his sixth-placed team, it was an understandable choice.\nWith no Mesut Ozil, Aaron Ramsey or Alexandre Lacazette, Arsenal were relying on their younger players and there were glimpses of promise. Slideshow (3 Images)\nBut it was United who drew first blood when Pogba burst through the midfield and fed Romelu Lukaku whose cross was headed against the post by ex-Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez and Pogba was on hand to convert.\nIt was a low key half, though, with little of the tension of some of Wenger’s other visits to Old Trafford, although Mkhitaryan went close and United’s Young struck the post with an attempted cross.\nThe hosts were mostly untroubled but lacked sharpness and they had a narrow escape just before the break when Reiss Nelson headed just wide.\nThe Gunners did get their equaliser, though, six minutes after the restart when Mkhitaryan was allowed to run at the United box before beating David de Gea with a well-placed low shot.\nFellaini was brought on to add height and physical presence for United and - not for the first time - that approach worked.\nHe headed against the post but Marcus Rashford’s follow-in was ruled offside before United tried the same approach again, the Belgian rising to head in Young’s cross and keep Mourinho’s side firmly on course for a second-place finish.\nThey are five points ahead of third-placed Liverpool but 16 adrift of champions Manchester City with three games left.\nFor Wenger, there was satisfaction in seeing his young players compete against one of the top sides.\n“It was unfortunate because we had a positive performance but we paid for the fatigue in the final 20 minutes from players who are not used to it. They did very well for the most part. It is unfortunate that they could not get the reward for that,” he said. Reporting by Simon Evans, editing by Pritha Sarkar and Ed Osmond",
