    "text": "Reston, VA, April 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- HighPoint Global ®, the citizen experience company TM , today announced that recently acquired digital transformation company Primescape Solutions will move under the HighPoint brand. Primescape, a Herndon, VA-based company that helps government agencies achieve their digital transformation goals with services including software development, data services, and interactive content was acquired by HighPoint in October 2017.\nThe acquisition of Primescape brought digital strategies, software development, and data services to HighPoint’s range of services. These capabilities complement HighPoint’s focus on improving the citizen experience (CX), with services including contact center optimization, training and learning management, quality assurance, and journey mapping. The combined company continues to provide support for the full range of citizen touchpoints with government including websites, mobile apps, video, social media, and call centers.\n“Our repertoire of solutions has been greatly enhanced by bringing the team at Primescape into the fold, and this rebranding is a result of the smooth integration of the two companies’ capabilities,” said Ben Lanius, CEO of HighPoint Global. “It’s been exciting to introduce our collective customers to our expanded capabilities and begin bidding on work that we never could have pursued alone.”\nFor more information about the combined company, visit the re-launched www.highpointglobal.com .\nAbout HighPoint\nHighPoint helps government agencies elevate the citizen experience TM by improving the touchpoints through which citizens interact with government. From contact centers and employee experience to digital and data services, our team works with government agencies to more efficiently integrate the people, processes and technology that help government deliver on the needs of citizens and employees. HighPoint delivers services for 15 government clients including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Office of the Comptroller of Currency, Department of State, Defense Logistics Agency and Department of Housing and Urban Development.\nHighPoint is a privately held company founded in 2006 with 350 employees across offices in Indianapolis, Indiana; Baltimore, Maryland; and Reston and Herndon, Virginia.
