    "text": "CHANTILLY, Va., April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Engility Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: EGL) represented by Amanda Brownfield, senior vice president of the Intelligence Solutions Group, was joined by National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Director Robert Cardillo to announce the 2018 winners of the Innovative GEOINT Application Provider Program Grand Challenge. Aviation Mobile Apps was awarded the $20,000 top prize for its Position Reporting app. Kelly Technology won the $5,000 runner-up award for Oceans Now.\n\"IGAPP offers a unique and very effective procurement model for geospatial data users,\" said Brownfield. \"Acting as a broker for NGA by vetting and securing apps from commercial developers, we've seen acquisition time drop from years to months. The Grand Challenge is an excellent way to recognize the best of those solutions.\"\nThe IGAPP Grand Challenge is an annual contest where IGAPP-approved app vendors participate in a two-month \"hackathon,\" building and delivering mobile apps addressing a variety of DOD-mission needs. In its third year, a record number of vendors vied for top place.\nThe Position Reporting app enables a user to instantly and discreetly send a distress message with an optional geolocation to a customizable contacts list via phone call, SMS or email -- without affecting mobile communication channels. The app also gives users the ability to create and receive \"geo-fenced\" areas from a mobile device and automatically send a customized emergency notification without any further inputs from the user. The Oceans Now app provides a holistic picture of the most current ocean conditions, weather forecasts, surface conditions and atmospheric data. The image leverages a variety of sources and is viewable in a user-configurable, geospatial, rotatable and zoom-able 3D globe.\nAbout IGAPP\nNGA's IGAPP, conceptualized and provisioned by Engility, bridges the gap between NGA and private sector app developers. Engility acts as the trusted broker for mobile app procurement, and by delivering specific user needs of a demographic typically unavailable to private developers, removes barriers to entry without incurring any up-front development costs. Compared to a typical formal acquisitions model, meaningful apps are now delivered in months instead of years.\nEngility's Grand Challenge is announced two months prior to the annual GEOINT Symposium, and the announcement for Grand Challenge 2019 is scheduled for March 2019 available at IGAPP's public website at https://igapp.com .\nAbout Engility\nEngility (NYSE: EGL), a $2 billion technology leader, has thousands of employees around the world working to make a difference.
