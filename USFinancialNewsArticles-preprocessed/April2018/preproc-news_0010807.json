In 2015, she launched Women Entrepreneurs Boston (WE BOS), a City of Boston program designed to advance local women entrepreneurs and create a more inclusive entrepreneurial ecosystem. Since the launch of the program more than 4,000 women have participated in WE BOS programs comprised of networking opportunities, educational workshops, panel discussions and coaching sessions with industry leaders and investors. Miller also spearheaded WE BOS week, a week-long event series created to celebrate and support Boston's women entrepreneurs in collaboration with 15 strategic partners. WE BOS's collaborative approach to supporting women entrepreneurs is viewed as a model that can be replicated nationally and Miller recently spoke about WE BOS and building entrepreneurial ecosystems at the National Women's Business Council's Quarterly meeting.\nMiller is also a member of the Boston Women's Workforce Council and has been a coach for Babson's Women Innovating Now Lab (WIN Lab). Before joining the City of Boston, Miller was the Executive Director of West Roxbury Main Streets, a non-profit organization with a focus on economic development and community revitalization and she received her MBA from the University of New Hampshire.\nAbout the Women Innovating Now (WIN) Lab at Babson\nCreated by the Center for Women's Entrepreneurial Leadership (CWEL) at Babson College, the Women Innovating Now (WIN) Lab provides women entrepreneurs with an inspiring community and a rigorous, experiential process that catalyzes innovative thinking and enables them to successfully scale their businesses.\nNow in its fifth year, the WIN Lab has been designated as one of the top two specialty programs for Excellence in Entrepreneurship Education by the United States Association for Small Business and Entrepreneurship; earned BostInno's designation as one of Boston's \"50 on Fire\" innovators and visionaries; and was honored by the prestigious Rosoff Awards for diversity.
