    "text": "Announces Addition of New CFO\nSANTA MONICA, CA, GOPHER PROTOCOL INC. (OTCQB: GOPH) (\"Gopher\"), a technology company which specializes in the creation of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled mobile technologies, released the results of its 10K filing for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nManagement of Gopher is excited to use this milestone to highlight what has been achieved in the past year. Revenue grew over 5,000% year over year when compared to year ended 2017 and Gopher has further developed its asset base, which is expected to support future operations and growth. https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1471781/000161577418002560/0001615774-18-002560-index.htm\nIn response to this increase in the size of Gopher’s operations, the Board has determined that additional resources in control and management of finances is prudent beginning with an initial step of engaging a Chief Financial Officer.\nThe Company appointed Mr. Kevin Pickard as its Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Pickard brings almost 30 years of accounting experience to Gopher. He is a licensed CPA with extensive experience in working with public companies.\nGopher’s board was specifically interested in Mr. Pickard’s experience in performing due diligence on potential acquisition candidates, preparing projections and business plans and assisting with corporate restructurings. Prior to opening his own CPA firm in 1998, he was a partner with Singer Lewak LLP, where he is co-managed the firm’s securities practice group.\nMr. Pickard also spent over nine years with Coopers & Lybrand, L.L.P., (currently PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP) where he focused on auditing companies in the insurance, high-tech and manufacturing industries. Mr. Pickard earned his Bachelor of Science in Accounting and Master of Accountancy from Brigham Young University.\n“Having worked with Gopher during 2017 and seeing the transformation first hand, I am excited to have the opportunity to become part of the team,” stated Kevin Pickard.\nAbout Gopher Protocol Inc.\nGopher Protocol Inc.
