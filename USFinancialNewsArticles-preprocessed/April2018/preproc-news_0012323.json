In line with the strategy, Changfeng has taken steps to divest its ownership stake in Pingxiang Changfeng Gas Co., Ltd. (“Pingxiang CF”) to free up capital for other investment opportunities. Accordingly, investment in Pingxiang CF is reclassified as an asset held for sale and its results for both the 2017 and 2016 years have been separately presented under discontinued operations and its revenue is no longer included in Changfeng’s consolidated revenue.\nFor more information, please refer the Company’s 2017 annual MD&A and consolidated financial statements.\nAbout Changfeng Energy Inc.\nChangfeng Energy Inc. is a Canadian public company currently traded on the Toronto Venture Exchange (\"TSX-V\") under the stock symbol \"CFY\". It is an integrated energy provider and natural gas distribution company (or natural gas utility) in the People's Republic of China.
