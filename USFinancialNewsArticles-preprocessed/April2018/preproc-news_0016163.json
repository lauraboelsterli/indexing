    "text": "WASHINGTON, April 4 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is not attacking the business sector with his recent critiques of Amazon.com Inc, but he wants a “level playing field” when it comes to taxes and the online retail giant, his economic adviser said on Wednesday.\n“His view on Amazon is we’ve got to have a level playing field with regards to taxes,” Kudlow told reporters at the White House. “They have improved their tax collections, but more can be done.”\nReporting by Steve Holland and Susan Heavey; Editing by Doina Chiacu\n ",
