    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Focus Ventures Ltd. (TSXV:FCV) (the “Company”) announces that at its annual and special meeting held yesterday, the shareholders of the Company have overwhelmingly voted in favour of the Company’s proposed name change, Yukon continuance, and share consolidation (see March 6, 2018 news release).\nSubject to final regulatory approvals, the Company’s name will be changed to “CROPS Inc.”, and management will be proceeding with a 4:1 consolidation of the Company’s outstanding securities.\nAbout Focus\nFocus is developing the Bayovar 12 phosphate deposit located 40 km from the coast in the Sechura District of northern Peru. Bayovar 12 hosts a large resource of highly-reactive sedimentary phosphate rock - a key raw material input for phosphate fertilizers and vital to world food production. Reactive phosphate rock from Sechura is a natural, slow-release source of phosphorus that can be applied directly to crops. One of Focus’s objectives is to supply direct application phosphate rock to the agricultural regions of Central and South America and Southeast Asia.\nFor further information, please visit our web site www.focusventuresltd.com .\nON BEHALF OF THE BOARD\nSimon Ridgway, Chief Executive Officer\nSymbol: TSXV-FCV\nShares Issued: 234.8-million\nFor further information, contact:\nGordon Tainton, President\nTel: 604-248-8380; Fax: 604-682-1514\nEmail: info@focusventuresltd.com\nWebsite: www.focusventuresltd.com\nNeither the TSX Venture Exchange nor the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements contained in this news release constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Canadian securities legislation. All statements included herein, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements and include, without limitation, statements about the Company’s plans to complete the name change and share consolidation. Often, but not always, these forward looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as “estimate”, “estimates”, “estimated”, “potential”, “open”, “future”, “assumed”, “projected”, “used”, “detailed”, “has been”, “gain”, “upgraded”, “offset”, “limited”, “contained”, “reflecting”, “containing”, “remaining”, “to be”, “periodically”, or statements that events, “could” or “should” occur or be achieved and similar expressions, including negative variations.\nForward-looking Statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. Such uncertainties and factors relate to, among other things, information regarding completing the name change and share consolidation; changes in general economic conditions and financial markets; t he Company or any joint venture partner not having the financial ability to meet its exploration and development goals; risks associated with the results of exploration and development activities, estimation of mineral resources and the geology, grade and continuity of mineral deposits; unanticipated costs and expenses; and such other risks detailed from time to time in the Company’s quarterly and annual filings with securities regulators and available under the Company’s profile on SEDAR at www.sedar.com . Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results to differ from those anticipated, estimated or intended.\nForward-looking statements contained herein are based on the assumptions, beliefs, expectations and opinions of management, including but not limited to: that the Company will obtain all necessary approvals to, and will, complete the name change and share consolidation as planned; that the Company will spend the financing proceeds as anticipated; that there will be no material adverse change affecting the Company or its properties; and such other assumptions as set out herein. Forward-looking statements are made as of the date hereof and the Company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or results or otherwise, except as required by law. There can be no assurance that forward-looking statements will prove to be accurate, as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nSource: Focus Ventures Ltd.",
