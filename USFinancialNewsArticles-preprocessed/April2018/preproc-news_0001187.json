    "text": "ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia’s new prime minister, Abiye Ahmed, promised on Monday to push through democratic reforms in an effort to end three years of unrest that first erupted in the province of Oromiya from where he hails.\nFILE PHOTO: Abiye Ahmed addresses a news conference in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia December 4, 2015. REUTERS/Stringer The ruling coalition picked Abiye last week to replace Hailemariam Desalegn, who quit to clear the way for reforms in Ethiopia, Africa’s second most populous nation and one of its fastest growing economies.\nAfter taking the oath of office, the former army lieutenant colonel struck a conciliatory tone towards the opposition but did not mention the possibility of lifting a six-month emergency rule imposed in February after Hailemariam resigned.\n“Today is a historic day. We bear witness to a peaceful transfer of power. Today our situation presents us with opportunities and threats,” Abiye told lawmakers in a 40-minute televised address.\n“Democracy cannot be realised in the absence of rights, be it civil or economic rights. We all need to have a platform to voice our concerns,” he told the packed gathering, where some dissidents were also allowed to attend.\nOromiya, which surrounds the capital Addis Ababa, has been plagued by violence since 2015, largely fuelled by a sense of political and economic marginalisation among its young population.\nOromos make up roughly a third of Ethiopia’s 100 million-strong population.\nNEED FOR UNITY The ruling Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) has been in power since 1991, when it took over from the Derg military regime.\nThe protests and unrest in Oromiya have posed the biggest ever threat to its continued rule, and have stoked ethnic tensions.\n“We have a long history as one single country. But today, relations between our ethnic groups are damaged,” said Seid Yimer Ali, an ethnic-Oromo opposition politician.\n“That should be his priority. He has to mend ties. He has to dismantle laws that encourage differences,” he said, referring to Ethiopia’s federal system which redrew regional boundaries along ethnic lines when implemented in 1991.\nIn his speech Abiye addressed the need for ethnic unity.\n“Our identity is interwoven and intermingled. We are born Ethiopians and we die as Ethiopians,” he said.\nParliamentarians from Oromiya - Ethiopia’s largest region by size and population - welcomed the appointment of a leader from an ethnic group that has long complained of being sidelined.\n“It is the first time in Ethiopia’s history that an Oromo has become the country’s leader. This is very significant because Oromos are the majority,” said lawmaker Abera Buno.\nHuman rights groups say security forces have killed hundreds of people and jailed tens of thousands in the past three years.\nOpposition leaders have called for the scrapping of a decade-old anti-terror law whose vague wording they say has effectively criminalised dissent. They also want the repeal of a law that restricts the work of non-governmental organisations.\nThe United States commended the peaceful transfer of power, but urged Ethiopia’s new leader to lift emergency rule.\n“We stand ready to support the government’s rapid implementation of democratic and economic reforms and look forward to the lifting of the state of emergency,” its embassy in Addis Ababa said in a statement.\nAbiye also said on Monday he wanted to resolve a two decade-old territorial dispute with neighbouring Eritrea, though this did not appear to represent a shift in policy as Addis Ababa has long sought such negotiations.\nAt a fruit shop near the parliament, Temesghen Abera was among a group of eight men who were sipping tea, huddled around a radio that replayed his speech.\n“It is too early to judge,” he said of Abiye’s appointment. “I hope he is brave enough to bring democracy and find ways to bring our divided country together.”\nReporting by Aaron Maasho; Editing by Maggie Fick and Gareth Jones\n ",
