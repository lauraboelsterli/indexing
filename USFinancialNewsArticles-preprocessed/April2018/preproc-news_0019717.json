    "text": "WASHINGTON/UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he expected to make decisions “fairly soon” on how to deal with Syria, where he has threatened missile strikes in response to a suspected poison gas attack, as a Russian envoy voiced fears of wider conflict between Washington and Moscow.\nWorries about a confrontation between Russia, Syria’s big ally, and the West have been running high since Trump said on Wednesday that missiles “will be coming” in response to the attack in the Syrian town of Douma on April 7, and lambasted Moscow for standing by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.\nTrump appeared to backtrack on Thursday ahead of a meeting with his national security aides about Syria in the White House.\n“Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all!” Trump wrote on Twitter.\nLater, he said: “We’re having a number of meetings today, we’ll see what happens. Now we have to make some...decisions, so they’ll be made fairly soon.”\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said France had proof the Syrian government carried out the attack near Damascus, which aid groups have said killed dozens of people, and will decide whether to strike back when all the necessary information has been gathered.\n“We have proof that last week ... chemical weapons were used, at least with chlorine, and that they were used by the regime of Bashar al-Assad,” Macron said, without offering details of any evidence.\nTwo U.S. officials familiar with an ongoing investigation of samples from Douma and the symptoms of victims said initial indications that a mix of weaponized chlorine gas and sarin were used in the attack appear correct. But U.S. intelligence agencies have not completed their assessment and reached a final conclusion, the officials said.\nRussia said it deployed military police in Douma on Thursday after the town was taken over by government forces.\nRelated Coverage Factbox: Assad's foreign backers in Syria's war Mattis says: 'I believe there was a chemical attack in Syria' Russia calls U.N. council meeting on Syria on Friday: diplomats “They are the guarantors of law and order in the town,” RIA news agency Quote: d Russia’s defense ministry as saying.\nThere were signs of a global effort to head off a direct confrontation between Russia and the West. The Kremlin said a crisis communications link with the United States, created to avoid an accidental clash over Syria, was in use.\nFEARS OF WAR Vassily Nebenzia, Moscow’s ambassador to the United Nations, said he “cannot exclude” war between the United States and Russia and urged Washington and its allies to refrain from military action against Syria.\n“The immediate priority is to avert the danger of war,” he told reporters. “We hope there will be no point of no return,” the envoy said.\nMoscow is estimated to have dozens of aircraft at its Hmeymim air base in Syria including fighters and bombers, as well as 10 to 15 warships and support vessels in the Mediterranean.\nThe Syrian government and Russian forces in Syria possess truck-mounted surface-to-air missile and anti-aircraft artillery weapons systems.\nFILE PHOTO - A man walks with his bicycle at a damaged site in the besieged town of Douma, Eastern Ghouta, in Damascus, Syria March 30, 2018. REUTERS/Bassam Khabieh Russia, Syria and its other main backer Iran have said reports of the Douma attack were fabricated by rebels and rescue workers and have accused the United States of seeking to use it as a pretext to attack the Syrian government.\nA team of experts from the global chemical weapons watchdog, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, was traveling to Syria and will start their investigations on Saturday, the Netherlands-based agency said.\nIt was not clear whether Trump and U.S. allies would wait for the results of the investigation before deciding on a possible strike.\nIn Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told Congress he believed there was a chemical attack in Syria, but added a short while later that the United States had not made any decision to launch military action.\n“I don’t want to talk about a specific attack that is not yet in the offing. ... This would be pre-decisional,” Mattis told the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee.\nNervous world stock markets showed signs of recovery after Trump’s signal that military strikes might not be imminent.\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May won backing from her senior ministers to take unspecified action with the United States and France to deter further use of chemical weapons by Syria.\nMay had recalled the ministers from their Easter holiday for the meeting to discuss Britain’s response to what she has cast as a barbaric attack that cannot go unchallenged.\nRussian ships had left the Tartus naval base in Syria, Interfax news agency Quote: d a Russian lawmaker as saying. Vladimir Shamanov, who chairs the defense committee of the lower house, said the vessels had departed the base for their own safety, which was “normal practice” when there were threats of attack.\nFILE PHOTO - The U.S. Navy Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Donald Cook sails in the Bosphorus strait in Istanbul, Turkey August 28, 2015. REUTERS/Yoruk Isik Any U.S. strike would probably involve the navy, given the risk to aircraft from Russian and Syrian air defenses. A U.S. guided-missile destroyer, the USS Donald Cook, is in the Mediterranean.\nThe Syrian conflict has widened the rifts between Moscow, Washington and European powers and inflamed the bitter rivalries that run across the Middle East.\nAdditional reporting by Angus McDowall in Beirut, William James, Guy Faulconbridge and David Milliken in London, Andrew Osborn, Maria Kiselyova and Jack Stubbs in Moscow, John Irish in Paris and Graham Fahy in Dublin, Jeff Mason, John Walcott, Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali in Washington and Michelle Nichols in the United Nations; Writing by Alistair Bell; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg and Will Dunham\n ",
