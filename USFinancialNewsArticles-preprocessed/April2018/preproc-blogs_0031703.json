Photo: Associated Press \nU.S. private middle-market companies posted a slower pace of year-over-year growth in the first two months of 2018 compared to the final quarter of 2017, according to a report by Golub Capital, a lender to these companies.\nThe report is based on the Golub Capital Altman Index, which measures the median revenue and earnings growth of more than 150 closely-held companies in Golub Capital’s loan portfolio. The index tracks performance for the first two months of each quarter and there are no energy extraction companies in the index.\nEarnings grew 6.2% during the first two months of the year versus the same period of 2017, a slowdown from 12.8% expansion notched in the same period of the final quarter of 2017, according to the index. It measures earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nBy contrast, revenue expanded by 11% in January and February 2018, roughly in line with the 11.5% increase notched during the prior year period. Still, this was the strongest first quarter for year-over-year revenue growth since the inception of the index in 2013.\n“Earnings growth is constrained more than anything else by the tight labor market,” said Lawrence Golub, the chief executive of Golub Capital.\nFor most of 2017, many of the Golub portfolio companies saw employment costs go up faster than the data reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Mr. Golub said.\n“Now, a significant number of companies just plain can’t hire some of the employees they need to produce,” Mr. Golub said. Many companies are reporting growing order backlogs, but it is not yet clear whether they are a result of increased orders or delays due to problems fulfilling existing orders, he added.\n“We have one company that’s finding that when they make offers to factory workers during the week, half of them don’t show up on Monday,” Mr. Golub said, adding that such inefficiencies add to costs.\nOther factors, such as rising energy prices and continuing improvement in healthcare costs also contributed to the decline in profit margins, Mr. Golub said.\nGolub Capital said that statistical testing of its index shows the middle-market private company results provide early insights into the overall growth of the S&P 500, as well as quarterly   data.\nShare this: EARNINGS MIDDLE MARKET COMPANIES Previous U.S. Executives Boost Appetite for Deals Following Tax Reform  ",
