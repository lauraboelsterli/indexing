    "text": "MCLEAN, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. (NYSE:HLT) (“Hilton”) announced today that its indirect subsidiary Hilton Domestic Operating Company Inc. (the “Issuer”) finalized the terms of the Issuer’s offering of $1,500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% Senior Notes due 2026 (the “Notes”). The Issuer anticipates that consummation of the offering will occur on April 13, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions, and intends to use the proceeds from the offering, together with available cash and borrowings under Hilton’s revolving credit facility, to fund the repurchase of 16,500,000 shares of common stock of Hilton beneficially owned by HNA Tourism Group Co., Ltd. and to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under Hilton’s senior secured term loan facility.\nThe Notes offered have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), or any state securities laws. The Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. The Notes were offered, by the initial purchasers, only to persons reasonably believed to be “qualified institutional buyers” in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nThis press release is being issued pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 135c under the Securities Act, and it is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities and shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a sale of, the Notes or any other securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “outlook,” “believes,” “expects,” “potential,” “continues,” “may,” “will,” “should,” “could,” “seeks,” “projects,” “predicts,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “anticipates” or the negative version of these words or other comparable words. Such forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, among others, risks inherent to the hospitality industry, macroeconomic factors beyond Hilton’s control, competition for hotel guests and management and franchise contracts, risks related to doing business with third-party hotel owners, performance of Hilton’s information technology systems, growth of reservation channels outside of Hilton’s system, risks of doing business outside of the United States and Hilton’s indebtedness. Additional factors that could cause Hilton’s results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements can be found under the section entitled “Part I-Item 1A. Risk Factors” of Hilton’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), as such factors may be updated from time to time in Hilton’s periodic filings with the SEC, which are accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov . Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual outcomes or results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this press release and in Hilton’s filings with the SEC. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180410006759/en/\nInvestor Contact\nJill Slattery\n+1 703 883 6043\nor\nMedia Contact\nNigel Glennie\n+1 703 883 5262\nSource: Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.",
