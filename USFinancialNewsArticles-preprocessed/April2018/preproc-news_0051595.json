    "text": "SHANGHAI, April 25 (Reuters) - German luxury carmaker Audi AG aims to double its China production with local partner FAW within five years, the firm’s chief executive said on Wednesday, as global carmakers look to localise in the world’s largest vehicle market.\nSpeaking at the Beijing auto show, Audi head Rupert Stadler said the firm would look to offer 10 new SUVs in the market by 2022, and that it expected 30 percent of its sales in the market would be electric vehicles by 2025.
