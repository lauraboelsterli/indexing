A broker laughs while speaking to a colleague, as they trade on their computer terminals at a stock brokerage firm in Mumbai, March 4, 2015. REUTERS/Shailesh Andrade/Files \nThe broader NSE Nifty ended 0.4 percent higher at 10,458.65, while the benchmark BSE Sensex closed 0.47 percent higher at 34,101.13. \nInfosys Ltd led the gains, closing 3.5 percent higher. The software services exporter will kick-start the January-March corporate results season on Friday. \nInvestors await March retail inflation data due later on Thursday for cues about the economy. Retail inflation likely eased to a five-month low in March as increases in food prices slowed once again but remained above the central bankâ€™s medium-term target, a Reuters poll found.
