    "text": "April 19, 2018 / 3:39 PM / Updated 33 minutes ago Wembley 'home' no advantage for Spurs against United - Pochettino Reuters Staff 3   Tottenham Hotspur manager Mauricio Pochettino denies his team will gain an advantage by playing Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United at their temporary Wembley home. Soccer Football - Premier League - Brighton & Hove Albion vs Tottenham Hotspur - The American Express Community Stadium, Brighton, Britain - April 17, 2018 Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino before the match Action Images via Reuters/Matthew Childs \nSpurs, who are using the national stadium this season while their new 61,500-seater stadium is being built, have turned Wembley into a fortress, suffering just two Premier League defeats there all season, and beating Borussia Dortmund, Real Madrid, Liverpool, Arsenal and United. \nDefender Jan Vertonghen suggested Spurs can benefit from their familiarity with the stadium but Pochettino said Jose Mourinho’s side have plenty of experience of their own at the venue. \n“Of course, we feel at home,” he told a news conference on Thursday. “But it’s different to when we play in the Premier League. \n“I don’t believe (we will have an advantage) because Manchester United have the experience (of playing) at Wembley, too. It’s not an event just for us. \n“I think it will be a typical cup game at Wembley - half Tottenham and half Manchester United. I don’t believe we are going to have some advantage for that.” \nIt will be United’s 29th appearance in an FA Cup semi-final, with their most recent win in the competition coming in 2016. Soccer Football - Premier League - Tottenham Hotspur vs Manchester City - Wembley Stadium, London, Britain - April 14, 2018 Tottenham's Jan Vertonghen in action with Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Couldridge \nTottenham, who last lifted the trophy in 1991, have suffered defeats in each of their last seven semi-finals in the competition. \nPochettino confirmed he had yet to make a decision on who would start in goal against United. \nDutch goalkeeper Michel Vorm has started in every round of the competition so far this season and could be expected to feature again. \nMeanwhile, first-choice shot-stopper Hugo Lloris has come under scrutiny for a reckless lunge on Raheem Sterling which handed Manchester City a penalty in Spurs’ 3-1 Premier League defeat last weekend. \n“For me it wasn’t a mistake but I respect all opinions,” Pochettino added. \n“No doubt he is one of the best keepers and he has shown that over the last four years with us. For us always every season (he) was improving and I think we have luck to have Hugo Lloris in goal.” Reporting by Hardik Vyas in Bengaluru,; Editing by Neville Dalton",
