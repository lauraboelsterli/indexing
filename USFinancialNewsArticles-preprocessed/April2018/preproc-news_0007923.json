    "text": "April 5, 2018 / 7:35 AM / Updated 43 minutes ago China says it never backs down in the face of threats after trade salvos with U.S. Reuters Staff 5 Min Read \nBEIJING (Reuters) - China has never surrendered to external pressure and it will win any trade war with the United States, the nation’s state media stressed in a series of editorials and columns in the hours after the world’s two top economies targeted each other with steep tariffs. Workers transport imported soybeans at a port in Nantong, Jiangsu province, China April 4, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer \nWhile China’a Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai stressed in comments to reporters in Washington that Beijing’s preference was to resolve the trade dispute through negotiations, Beijing’s official mouthpieces were taking a more belligerent line. \nThe ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily newspaper said Beijing’s quick counter-move had caught the Americans off guard. \n“Within 24 hours of the U.S. publishing its list, China drew its sword, and with the same strength and to the same scale, counterattacked quickly, fiercely and with determination,” the paper said in a commentary on Thursday. \n“The confidence to know that [China] will win the trade war comes from the scale of [China’s] consumer market,” the paper said, noting that China’s market potential is incomparable to other economies. \nMany American consumer product and industrial companies see the Chinese market as a big source for future growth given the continued rise in the number of people joining both the middle class and the wealthier levels of Chinese society.

The country has never surrendered to external pressure, and it will not surrender this time either,” Xinhua said. Imported soybeans are transported at a port in Nantong, Jiangsu province, China April 4, 2018. REUTERS/Stringer \nThe apparent determination not to retreat is at the polar opposite of comments by White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, who told Fox News Channel on Wednesday: “I believe that the Chinese will back down and will play ball.” “BULLYING TACTICS” \nShortly after U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration issued its list, China’s ambassador to the World Trade Organization urged all of the trade body’s members to join with China to counter U.S. trade abuses. \n“China’s counter tariffs are a spectacular way of standing up to America’s bullying tactics, not only for itself, but for other countries threatened by the United States’ new trade policies,” the nationalist Global Times said in an editorial on Thursday. \nWhile Beijing’s claims that Washington is the aggressor and spurring global protectionism, China’s trading partners for years have complained that it abuses WTO rules, and practices unfair industrial policies at home that lock foreign companies out of crucial sectors with the intent of creating domestic champions. \nChina has repeatedly pledged that it would open up sectors such as financial services, including promises to the Trump administration last year that it would give “full and prompt market access” to U.S. payment network operators.

Washington will hold public comment period expected to last around two months, and Chinese officials have said its implementation will depend on U.S. action. \nCui met with Acting U.S. Secretary of State John Sullivan in Washington on Wednesday, and later told reporters that the two countries should avoid a trade war. \n“Negotiation would still be our preference, but it takes two to tango,” Cui said.
