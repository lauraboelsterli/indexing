Dr. Stevens has been a dedicated ASAPS member for 24 years, serving the organization on a variety of committees including the Executive Committee, Aesthetic Training Committee, Conflict of Interest Committee, External Marketing Committee, Finance and Investment Committee, Industry Exhibits Committee, Industry Support Committee and the Women Aesthetic Surgeons Committee. Dr. Stevens is currently on the Editorial Board of the Aesthetic Surgery Journal, the Aesthetic Surgery Education and Research Foundation's Board of Directors and has served on the ASAPS Board of Directors since 2011.\nAs President, Dr. Stevens will drive the critical initiatives identified by the Board to expand the reach of The Aesthetic Society and grow the organization. These include attracting more new, young members to the organization to develop an even broader perspective on the aesthetic surgery marketplace and attracting more female plastic surgeons to ASAPS to balance out the female-to-male member ratio as more women are becoming plastic surgeons than ever before. Part of the recruitment efforts will also include expanding ASAPS' resident education offerings, thereby increasing the number of candidates for membership. Expansion of ASAPS' body of international members will also be a focus to enhance and exchange knowledge within the global aesthetic community.\n\"With Grant Stevens as President, the Aesthetic Society is in great hands to continue its mission of providing the best aesthetic education for our members.
