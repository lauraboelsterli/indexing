    "text": "MONDOVI, Wis., April 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Marten Transport, Ltd. (Nasdaq/GS:MRTN) today reported a 25.8% increase in net income to $10.3 million, or 19 cents per diluted share, for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, from $8.2 million, or 15 cents per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in earnings was primarily due to the reduction of Marten's federal income tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.\nOperating revenue improved 8.0% to $187.0 million for the first quarter of 2018 from $173.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. Excluding fuel surcharges, operating revenue improved 4.7% to $163.8 million for the 2018 quarter from $156.6 million for the 2017 quarter. Fuel surcharge revenue increased to $23.1 million for the first quarter of 2018 from $16.6 million for the 2017 quarter.\nOperating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue was 92.7% for the first quarter of 2018 and 92.0% for the first quarter of 2017. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, with both amounts net of fuel surcharges, was 91.7% for the first quarter of 2018 compared with 91.1% for the first quarter of 2017.\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer Randolph L. Marten said, “We continue to position our operations to capitalize on the strengthened freight environment. We improved our revenue excluding fuel surcharges in our Dedicated and Intermodal operations, our primary growth areas for this year, by 17.6% over the first quarter of 2017. We expect to deliver revenue and profitability growth throughout 2018 with increased compensation for our premium services, additional freight with existing and new customers, and our continued emphasis on cost controls.”\n“Our agreements with a number of customers included a shift during the quarter between line haul and fuel surcharge revenue, which reduced our Dedicated and Truckload revenue, net of fuel surcharges, by $106 and $13 per tractor per week, while increasing our fuel surcharge revenue by the same amounts.”\nMarten Transport, with headquarters in Mondovi, Wis., is one of the leading temperature-sensitive truckload carriers in the United States, specializing in transporting and distributing food and other consumer packaged goods that require a temperature-controlled or insulated environment. Marten’s dry freight services are expanding, with 1,376 dry trailers operating as of March 31, 2018.
