    "text": "April 6, 2018 / 6:36 AM / Updated 29 minutes ago LG Electronics says first quarter profit likely rose 20 percent, above expectations Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nSEOUL (Reuters) - South Koreaâ€™s LG Electronics Inc ( 066570.KS ) said on Friday first-quarter operating profit likely rose 20 percent from a year earlier, beating market expectations. FILE PHOTO: The LG logo is seen on a washing machine in Singapore January 26, 2018. REUTERS/Thomas White/File Photo \nLG estimated January-March profit at 1.1 trillion won ($1.03 billion) versus a Thomson Reuters StarMine SmartEstimate of 935 billion won from a poll of 16 analysts. \nRevenue likely climbed 3 percent to 15.1 trillion won, compared with a 15.4 trillion won projected by SmartEstimate, which gives greater weight to recent estimates by analysts who are more consistently accurate. \nThe firm will disclose full results at the end of April.
