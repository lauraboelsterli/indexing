She currently serves as President and Executive Director and as a member of the board of directors of the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH), an independent 501(c)(3) charitable organization established by Congress to support the mission of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by raising private funds for biomedical research and fostering partnerships and alliances around the world. Dr. Freire was previously President and a member of the board of directors of The Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation and, before that, President and CEO of the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development.\n“I’m pleased to welcome Dr. Maria Freire to the Exelixis board of directors,” said Stelios Papadopoulos, Ph.D., an Exelixis co-founder and chairman of the company’s board. “Her breadth of experience in biomedical research and development can benefit Exelixis greatly as the company recommits its resources to drug discovery and bolstering its pipeline following the successful ongoing commercialization of its lead medicine, CABOMETYX.”\nDr. Freire began her current position as President and Executive Director of the FNIH in November 2012. From March 2008 to November 2012, she served as President of The Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation.
