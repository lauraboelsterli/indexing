    "text": "April 20, 2018 / 3:00 AM / Updated an hour ago Some 50 members of migrant caravan reach Mexico, U.S. border Lizbeth Diaz 2 Min Read \nMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A group of 50 Central American migrants who set out from southern Mexico in late March have reached the U.S. border, having endured the long journey despite threats by President Donald Trump to secure the border with National Guard personnel. Central American migrants, moving in a caravan through Mexico, travel to Mazatlan, as part of their new travel route, in Tlaquepaque, in Jalisco state, Mexico April 19, 2018. REUTERS/Edgard Garrido \nSince peaking at around 1,500 people, the so-called migrant “caravan” has dwindled under pressure from Trump and Mexican migration authorities, who vowed to separate those migrants with a right to stay in Mexico from those who did not. \nSome of those migrants began arriving in the Mexican border city of Tijuana on Wednesday and have requested asylum in the United States. \n“Since yesterday, some began to cross into the United States to turn themselves in from Tijuana and request asylum. We understand more of (the migrants) will do the same,” said Jose Maria Garcia, director of Juventud 2000, an organisation dedicated to assisting migrants.
