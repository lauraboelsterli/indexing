    "text": "April 20, 2018 / 2:51 PM / Updated 36 minutes ago Soccer - New club built from soy bean fortune growing quickly Maximilian Heath 2 Min Read \nCARLOS CASARES, Argentina (Reuters) - Build it and they will come is a phrase associated with baseball but in Argentina, where football is king, a soy bean millionaire has done just that, building a soccer club from scratch that is now knocking on the door of the country’s first division. Agropecuario's Martin Prost (R) and Almagro's Adrian Torres fight for the ball during their Argentine Second Division match at Ofelia Rosenzuaig stadium in Carlos Casares, Argentina, April 16, 2018. REUTERS/Agustin Marcarian \nBernardo Grobocopatel, who is known as the “Soy Bean King” in Carlos Casares, a small city 186 miles west (300 km) of the capital Buenos Aires, made his fortune in agriculture but that wasn’t enough for the ambitious football fanatic. \n“We were doing well economically but I felt there was something missing in my life and that was doing what I felt passionate about,” Grobocopatel told Reuters, explaining why he started Club Agropecuario Argentino. \n“We started from zero, literally from nothing. No players, no pitch, no buildings at all,” he said of the $20 million investment that included a brand new stadium for 20,000 people, half the population of the surrounding city. Slideshow (12 Images) \nArgentina is the third biggest exporter of soy in the world and the principal producer of soy bean oil and derivatives. \nGrobocopatel (pictured in the accompanying photo) made his fortune from the beans and his investment has pushed the team to the threshold of Argentina’s first division after just six years of existence. \nAfter leading the second tier earlier this year three successive losses have dented their chances a little, but they are still in a dog fight for a coveted playoff place and the chance to face giants such as River Plate and Boca Juniors next year.
