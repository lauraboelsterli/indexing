    "text": "SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Air China ( 601111.SS ) ( 0753.HK ) reported a higher quarterly net profit on Thursday, which it said was helped by a strengthening yuan and improved passenger and cargo volumes.\nThe logo of China Eastern Airlines is shown on a panel at a check-in counter at Hong Kong Airport in Hong Kong, China April 4, 2018. REUTERS/Bobby Yip China’s flag carrier posted profit attributable to shareholders of 2.63 billion yuan ($415.6 million) for January to March, 79.2 percent higher than the 1.47 billion yuan it reported for the same period last year.\nIts rival China Eastern Airlines ( 600115.SS ) ( 0670.HK ), the country’s second-largest by passenger numbers, said on Thursday its net profit attributable to shareholders fell 29.6 percent to 1.98 billion yuan for the quarter.\nFILE PHOTO: An Air China Airbus A330-200 aircraft takes off from Zurich Airport January 9, 2018. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo But discounting one-off gains from an asset sale that it made in the first quarter of 2017, China Eastern said its profits rose 49.4 percent, citing a 9.1 percent rise in passenger traffic as one driver.\nThe two airlines have financed their fleet expansions using many dollar-denominated loans to buy aircraft, so the strengthening of the yuan has helped cut finance costs. It has also helped them offset higher operating costs as fuel prices rise.\nAir China’s 2017 results had lagged analysts’ forecasts due to higher-than-expected operating costs. [nL3N1RA1HH]\nEarlier this month, the airline said it carried 7.8 percent more passengers in the first quarter, while cargo volumes rose 5.5 percent.
