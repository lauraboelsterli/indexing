Deutsche Bank AG are seen in Tokyo July 16, 2014. REUTERS/Toru Hanai/File Photo\nThe bank, Germany’s largest, has been under pressure to cut costs and return to profitability after three years of losses. Deutsche Bank had been seeking permission to use the deposits more freely for some time.\nThe funds will not be used for risky ventures in investment banking.\n“Deutsche Bank received approval,” the spokesman said.\nThe ECB, which supervises Deutsche Bank, declined to comment.\nDeutsche Bank is in the process of integrating Postbank, the retail banking business once owned by the German postal service, with its own retail banking operations to save costs.\nThe new business will have 20 million customers with about 325 billion euros ($395.92 billion) in deposits, according to Deutsche Bank.\n($1 = 0.8209 euros)",
