    "text": "April 6, 2018 / 1:00 PM / in 19 minutes Norway's central bank chief says trade war could still be prevented Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON, April 6 (Reuters) - Recent global trade tensions and protectionism are worrying Norway’s central bank, although there is still hope of avoiding a trade war, its governor said on Friday. \n“We can all share a concern at measures taken these days in the direction of protectionism, that is a worry, we are a small economy dependent on open trade,” Norges Bank’s Oeystein Olsen told a business conference in London. \n“I believe down the road common sense will prevail among different authorities in major economies so we avoid a trade war. Steps taken these days are worrying,” he added. (Reporting by Tom Finn, writing by Terje Solsvik, editing by Gwladys Fouche)",
