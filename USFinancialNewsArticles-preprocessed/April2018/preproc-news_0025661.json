Consequently, profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and the year ended March 31, 2018 has increased and therefore has led to an increase in Basic earnings per equity share by $0.10 for quarter ended December 31, 2017 and $0.09 for the year ended March 31, 2018.\nIn the quarter ended March 2018, on conclusion of a strategic review of the portfolio businesses, the Company initiated identification and evaluation of potential buyers for its subsidiaries, Kallidus and Skava (together referred to as \"Skava\") and Panaya (collectively referred to as the \"disposal group\"). The Company anticipates completion of the sale by March 2019 and accordingly, assets amounting to $316 million and liabilities amounting to $50 million in respect of the disposal group have been reclassified as \"held for sale\". On reclassification, the disposal group has been measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell and consequently, an impairment loss of $18 million in respect of Panaya has been recognized in the consolidated profit and loss for the quarter and year ended March 31, 2018. The disposal group does not constitute a separate major component of the company and therefore has not been classified as discontinued operations\nOther income includes $41 million towards interest on income tax refund for the year ended March 31, 2018\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2018, the Company has written down the entire carrying value of the investment in its associate DWA Nova LLC amounting to $11 million.
