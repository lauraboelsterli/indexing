    "text": "Also announces changes in Board of Directors and Management\nIRVING, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Global Power Equipment Group Inc. (OTC: GLPW) (“Global Power” or the “Company”) today reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company made the decision to exit and sell its Electrical Solutions segment. Additionally, in October 2017, the Company sold substantially all of its Mechanical Solutions segment, as well as its manufacturing facility and remaining production equipment in Mexico. Accordingly, these segments have been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented, and the Company’s results are presented as a single segment comprised of the former Services segment (or “Williams”) and corporate headquarter operations.\nFourth quarter 2017 revenue from continuing operations was $44.3 million compared with $59.1 million in the prior-year period, a $14.8 million decline. Gross profit from continuing operations for the 2017 fourth quarter decreased $1.5 million to $8.0 million. Loss from continuing operations for the 2017 quarter was $3.2 million, or $(0.18) per share, compared with $3.5 million, or $(0.20) per share, for the corresponding 2016 period. Total net loss was $12.3 million, or $(0.69) per share, compared with $7.0 million, or $(0.40) per share, for the prior-year period.\nFor the full year 2017, revenue from continuing operations was $187.0 million compared with $231.0 million in 2016. Loss from continuing operations was $30.0 million, or $(1.70) per share. Total net loss was $56.5 million, or $(3.20) per share.\nTracy Pagliara, President and CEO of Global Power, noted, “The outcome of 2017 was disappointing. Our operating performance was below expectations and the process to evaluate strategic alternatives for our Electrical Solutions (Koontz-Wagner) business has not progressed as quickly as we planned. Additionally, our liquidity position, while somewhat improved recently, continues to constrain our business and, to further complicate matters, closing on a new revolving loan facility in a timely manner has proven to be a challenge.\n“Importantly, we are making good progress thus far in 2018. Several contingencies have been positively resolved. We have a well-respected team in our markets and our backlog for Williams is strengthening. We also believe several growth initiatives being pursued to enhance Williams’ performance appear promising. Given this momentum and other relevant considerations, our Board has concluded it is an opportune time to evaluate strategic alternatives for Global Power, with the goal of advancing the best interests of our shareholders and providing improved long-term opportunities for our customers and employees. We also continue to work diligently to conclude the sale of Electrical Solutions by the end of the second quarter.”\nRecent Developments\nReceived resolution of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) Division of Enforcement’s investigation. On March 8, 2018, the SEC Enforcement Staff informed the Company that they had completed their investigation into possible securities law violations by the Company relating to its disclosures concerning certain financial information, including its cost of sales and revenue recognition, as well as related accounting issues. Based on the information available to the SEC Enforcement Staff as of the date of their letter, they do not intend to recommend an enforcement action by the SEC against the Company. Resolved disputes related to previously disclosed unapproved change orders and recorded revenue of $2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Discussions for an asset-based loan have resumed with various lending groups following the resolution of several contingencies that prevented the Company from closing on an asset-based loan earlier. Negotiated a $3.0 million incremental loan commitment with the Company’s primary lender, which can be drawn upon in minimum increments of $1.0 million and provides the Company with access to emergency funding in the event it is needed. Reduced the size of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”), prior to the date of this press release, from twelve members to five members to better align with the size of the organization and to reduce costs. Developed a plan to initiate corporate cost reductions designed to integrate and streamline certain back office operations, including the reduction in executive staff. Cost reductions will continue through 2018 and are expected to accelerate following the intended disposition of Electrical Solutions.\nProgress in 2017\nSold the Mechanical Solutions segment, including its related Mexico facility and equipment, and used a portion of the total net proceeds of $44.5 million to reduce debt by $35.9 million in October 2017, including full repayment of a $10.0 million first-out term loan from August 2017. Formed a limited liability company, of which the Company is a 25% member, with a prime construction contractor to supply craft labor and supervision for the construction of the new nuclear power facilities at Plant Vogtle Units 3 & 4. The completion of the units is planned for 2021 and 2022. The Company also was awarded other work separate from the limited liability company and is currently bidding on other opportunities for direct scope of work. Secured a $45.0 million senior secured term loan that was used to repay in full all outstanding loans and obligations under the Company’s previous credit agreement, which was in default. Collected $6.4 million of outstanding receivables for pre-petition services rendered to a customer that filed for bankruptcy protection. Favorably resolved and released to revenue a $4.4 million contingent liability that was originally recorded in 2015. Awarded several new nuclear and fossil-power contracts, including new long-term contracts with well-established customers of the Company. Sold the stock of Hetsco, Inc. (“Hetsco”), a wholly owned subsidiary, for net proceeds of $20.2 million.\nConsolidated Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 (compared with the corresponding period in 2016 unless noted otherwise)\nRevenue from continuing operations declined $14.8 million, of which $6.2 million was related to the divestiture of Hetsco in January of 2017. An $8.2 million increase in revenue associated with construction activities at Vogtle 3 & 4 was offset by a $12.4 million reduction in revenue related to the completion of several fixed-price nuclear contracts. Gross profit from continuing operations declined primarily as a result of lower revenue, whereas gross margin expanded 190 basis points to 18.0% compared with the 2016 quarter due to an improved mix of business and the recognition of $2.8 million of revenue with 100% margin resulting from the resolution of disputed unapproved change orders. The 2017 period also included $1.8 million of zero margin revenue associated with estimated loss contracts. Operating expenses were down $0.6 million due primarily to a decline in restatement expenses as a result of the wind-down of restatement activities in conjunction with the filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Interest expense increased $5.1 million due to the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the repayment of $35.9 million on the term loan, including full repayment of the $10.0 million first-out term loan, in October 2017. At the end of the period, backlog was $137.7 million compared with $138.6 million as of the end of 2016. An increase in demand on existing contracts and new contract awards related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 & 4 mostly offset the $18.3 million in 2016 backlog related to the timing of work for a scheduled nuclear facility outage that occurs every 18 months. Backlog as of December 31, 2017 included $85.6 million related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 & 4, which represented 62.2% of total backlog. Backlog is expected to improve $12.4 million in the first quarter of 2018 to an estimated $150.1 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $0.3 million compared with $3.5 million. See “NOTE 1—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” to the attached tables for important disclosures regarding Global Power's use of Adjusted EBITDA, as well a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA.\nConsolidated Results for the Year Ended December 31, 2017 (compared with the corresponding year ended 2016 unless noted otherwise)\nRevenue from continuing operations was $187.0 million compared with $231.0, a $44.0 million decline. Gross profit from continuing operations decreased $13.3 million to $17.9 million. Operating loss from continuing operations increased $4.1 million to $22.0 million as a $9.2 million decline in operating expenses was insufficient to offset the $13.3 million reduction in gross profit. Interest expense increased $6.3 million due to the amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the repayment of $35.9 million on the term loan, including full repayment of the $10.0 million first-out term loan. Loss from continuing operations was $30.0 million, or $(1.70) per share. Total net loss was $56.5 million, or $(3.20) per share.\nAdjusted EBITDA was $(11.7) million in 2017 compared with $(3.4) million in the prior year.\nSee “NOTE 1—Non-GAAP Financial Measures” to the attached tables for important disclosures regarding Global Power's use of Adjusted EBITDA, as well a reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA.\nBoard Composition and Executive Management\nGlobal Power also announced that its Board of Directors has been reduced from twelve members to five members, consistent with the Board composition plans to better align with the size of the organization and to reduce costs. The Board now consists of four non-executive directors: David A. B. Brown, Charles Macaluso, Robert B. Mills and Nelson Obus. Charles Macaluso will continue as Chairman of the Board.\nVoluntarily resigning their positions from the Board were Carl Bartoli, director since January 2008; Linda A. Goodspeed, director since May 2016; David Keller, director since May 2015; Michael E. Rescoe, director since July 2014; Michael E. Salvati, director since August 2011; and Gary J. Taylor, director since October 2015.\nThe Board also announced that Craig E. Holmes voluntarily resigned from his positions as Co-President and Co-CEO and director as part of the Company’s plan to reduce costs and transition into an operating business from a holding company structure.\nMr. Macaluso, Chairman of the Board, commented, “I offer my heartfelt thanks to our outgoing directors for their diligence during trying times and their commitment to sound governance and serving our shareholders. Their combined wisdom and experience have been greatly valued by all.\n“I also am very appreciative of Craig’s dedication and hard work during his time at Global Power. His financial and operating experience and knowledge combined with his strong leadership skills and strategic thinking enabled Global Power to survive through extremely challenging situations. We wish him all the best in his next endeavor.”\nPresident and CEO, Tracy D. Pagliara, will continue to serve as a director.\nLiquidity Update\nAs of April 9, 2018, the Company had cash and equivalents on-hand of $8.5 million, restricted cash of $10.4 million and had an outstanding gross debt balance of approximately $25.9 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company consumed $30.9 million of cash in operations, including discontinued operations. The Company’s liquidity has remained very constrained as a result of continued losses, inconsistent cash flows from operations and the inability to borrow additional amounts for short-term working capital needs or issue additional standby letters of credit.\nManagement continues to assess and implement steps in its liquidity plan, including the pursuit of a new line of credit and the evaluation of strategic alternatives for the Company as a whole.\n2018 Outlook\nMr. Pagliara concluded, “Given our current backlog, we expect our business to grow in 2018 while margins return to normalized levels. Importantly, we are excited to pursue the pipeline of increasingly diverse opportunities in front of us, including our new growth initiatives in the decommissioning market, our expansion into Canada and the oil and gas industry and the opportunities presented by analog to digital conversions in power generation. We also intend to bid on more scope of work at Plant Vogtle Units 3 & 4 as the project advances. We plan to make substantial reductions in our general and administrative expenses as we transition into an operating business from a holding company structure. In the meantime, as previously noted, we are evaluating strategic alternatives for the Company.”\nThe Company expects to hold a meeting of shareholders upon conclusion of its strategic alternatives review or not later than December 2018, whichever comes first.\nWebcast and Teleconference\nThe Company will host a conference call on Tuesday, April 17, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time (9:00 a.m. Central).

Adjusted EBITDA is the sum of our net loss before interest expense, net and income tax (benefit) expense and unusual gains or charges. It also excludes non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization. The Company’s management believes adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management, investors and others to evaluate and compare the performance of its core operations from period to period by removing the impact of the capital structure (interest), tangible and intangible asset base (depreciation and amortization), taxes and unusual gains or charges (stock-based compensation, restatement expenses, asset disposition costs, loss on sale of business and net assets held for sale, bank restructuring costs, loss on sale-leaseback and severance costs), which are not always commensurate with the reporting period in which such items are included. Global Power’s credit facility also contains ratios based on EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income or as a better measure of liquidity than net cash flows from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, and, therefore, should not be used in isolation from, but in conjunction with, the GAAP measures. The use of any non-GAAP measure may produce results that vary from the GAAP measure and may not be comparable to a similarly defined non-GAAP measure used by other companies.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180416006361/en/\nInvestor Relations:\nKei Advisors LLC\nDeborah K.
