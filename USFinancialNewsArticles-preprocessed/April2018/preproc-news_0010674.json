    "text": "CHICAGO (Reuters) - DowDuPont Inc said on Wednesday that its agriculture unit could be affected by the escalating U.S.-China trade conflict, after Beijing announced new tariffs on imports of U.S. soybeans and other goods.\nThe company believes there could be “price declines in the total market” for soybeans, with negative impacts on U.S. farmers, spokesman Gregg Schmidt said. DowDuPont’s agriculture unit, Corteva Agriscience, also could see its U.S. share affected “pro rata based on our current share,” he said.\nReporting by Tom Polansek; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama\n ",
