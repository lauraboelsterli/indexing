    "text": "SUGAR LAND, Texas, April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CVR Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CVI) today announced net income of $66 million, or 76 cents per diluted share, on net sales of $1,537 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to net income of $22 million, or 26 cents per diluted share, on net sales of $1,507 million for the 2017 first quarter. First quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $86 million, compared to first quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $80 million.\n“CVR Refining reported solid financial results for the 2018 first quarter,” said Dave Lamp, CVR Energy’s chief executive officer. “The quarter’s fiscal performance was driven by stronger crack spreads, hedging gains, a reduction to CVR Refining’s estimated Renewable Volume Obligation and lower Renewable Identification Number prices.\n“CVR Partners' Coffeyville, Kansas, fertilizer plant performed extremely well during the 2018 first quarter, posting on-stream rates at or near 100 percent,” Lamp said. “While unfavorable weather conditions have delayed the start of the spring application, we expect a strong planting season due to lower than average customer inventory levels.”\nPetroleum Business\nThe petroleum business, which is operated by CVR Refining and includes the Coffeyville and Wynnewood refineries, reported first quarter 2018 operating income of $97 million on net sales of $1,458 million, compared to operating income of $66 million on net sales of $1,424 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nRefining margin adjusted for FIFO impact per crude oil throughput barrel, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $13.77 in the 2018 first quarter, compared to $11.54 during the same period in 2017. Direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization), excluding major scheduled turnaround expenses, per combined total throughput, for the 2018 first quarter were $5.49, compared to $4.34 in the first quarter of 2017.\nFirst quarter 2018 combined crude oil throughput was approximately 178,000 barrels per day (bpd), compared to approximately 214,000 bpd of combined crude oil throughput for the first quarter of 2017.\nNitrogen Fertilizers Business\nThe fertilizer business, which is operated by CVR Partners and includes the Coffeyville and East Dubuque fertilizer facilities, reported a first quarter 2018 operating loss of $3 million on net sales of $80 million, compared to operating income of $5 million on net sales of $85 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nFor the first quarter of 2018, consolidated average realized gate prices for UAN and ammonia were $153 per ton and $322 per ton, respectively. Consolidated average realized gate prices for UAN and ammonia were $160 per ton and $308 per ton, respectively, for the same period in 2017.\nCVR Partners’ fertilizer facilities produced a combined 199,000 tons of ammonia during the first quarter of 2018, of which 59,000 net tons were available for sale while the rest was upgraded to other fertilizer products, including 339,000 tons of UAN. In the 2017 first quarter, the fertilizer facilities produced 219,000 tons of ammonia, of which 80,000 net tons were available for sale while the remainder was upgraded to other fertilizer products, including 342,000 tons of UAN.\nCash, Debt and Dividend\nConsolidated cash and cash equivalents was $420 million at March 31, 2018. Consolidated total debt was $1,167 million at March 31, 2018. The company had no debt exclusive of CVR Refining’s and CVR Partners’ debt.\nCVR Energy also announced a first quarter 2018 cash dividend of 50 cents per share. The dividend, as declared by CVR Energy’s Board of Directors, will be paid on May 14, 2018, to stockholders of record on May 7, 2018.\nToday, CVR Refining announced a 2018 first quarter cash distribution of 51 cents per common unit. CVR Partners announced that it will not pay a cash distribution for the 2018 first quarter.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call\nCVR Energy previously announced that it will host its first quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call for analysts and investors on Thursday, April 26, at 3 p.m. Eastern. The Earnings Conference Call may also include discussion of company developments, forward-looking information and other material information about business and financial matters.\nThe Earnings Conference Call will be broadcast live over the Internet at\nhttp://edge.media-server.com/m6/p/5vre2rts . For investors or analysts who want to participate during the call, the dial-in number is (877) 407-8291.\nFor those unable to listen live, the webcast will be archived and available for 14 days at\nhttp://edge.media-server.com/m6/p/5vre2rts .

The cost of fuel natural gas is included in direct operating expense (exclusive of depreciation and amortization).\n(4) The cost per MMBtu excludes derivative activity, when applicable. The impact of natural gas derivative activity during the periods presented was not material.\n(5) On-stream factor is the total number of hours operated divided by the total number of hours in the reporting period and is included as a measure of operating efficiency.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our actual results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") for the applicable periods, we also use the non-GAAP financial measures noted above, which are reconciled to our GAAP-based results below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative for GAAP results. The adjustments are provided to enhance an overall understanding of our financial performance for the applicable periods and are indicators management believes are relevant and useful for planning and forecasting future periods.\nAdjusted net income is not a recognized term under GAAP and should not be substituted for net income (loss) as a measure of our performance, but rather should be utilized as a supplemental measure of financial performance in evaluating our business. Management believes that adjusted net income provides relevant and useful information that enables external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, to better understand and evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in the review of our overall financial, operational and economic performance. Adjusted net income per diluted share represents adjusted net income divided by the weighted-average diluted shares outstanding. Adjusted net income represents net income (loss), as adjusted, that is attributable to CVR Energy stockholders.\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 (in millions, except per share data) Reconciliation of Income before income tax expense to Adjusted Net Income: Income before income tax expense $ 124.4 $ 53.0 Adjustments: FIFO impact, (favorable) unfavorable (20.4 ) 0.3 Major scheduled turnaround expenses — 12.9 Gain on derivatives, net (59.3 ) (12.2 ) Current period settlement on derivative contracts (1) 13.7 1.2 Adjusted net income before income tax expense and noncontrolling interest 58.4 55.2 Adjusted net income attributed to noncontrolling interest (14.9 ) (16.7 ) Income tax expense, as adjusted (9.5 ) (15.4 ) Adjusted net income $ 34.0 $ 23.1 Adjusted net income per diluted share $ 0.39 $ 0.27 Refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel is a measurement calculated as the difference between the Petroleum segment's net sales and cost of materials and other. Refining margin is a non-GAAP measure that we believe is important to investors in evaluating the refineries’ performance as a general indication of the amount above their cost of materials and other at which they are able to sell refined products. Each of the components used in this calculation (net sales and cost of materials and other) can be taken directly from our Petroleum segment's Statements of Operations. Our calculation of refining margin may differ from similar calculations of other companies in the industry, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. In order to derive the refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel, we utilize the total dollar figures for refining margin as derived above and divide by the applicable number of crude oil throughput barrels for the period. We believe that refining margin and refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel are important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate the Petroleum segment’s ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in the review of our overall financial, operational and economic performance.\nRefining margin per crude oil throughput barrel adjusted for FIFO impact is a measurement calculated as the difference between the Petroleum segment’s net sales and cost of materials and other adjusted for FIFO impact. Refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact is a non-GAAP measure that we believe is important to investors in evaluating the refineries’ performance as a general indication of the amount above their cost of materials and other (taking into account the impact of the utilization of FIFO) at which they are able to sell refined products. Our calculation of refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact may differ from calculations of other companies in the industry, thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Under the FIFO accounting method, changes in crude oil prices can cause fluctuations in the inventory valuation of crude oil, work in process and finished goods, thereby resulting in a favorable FIFO impact when crude oil prices increase and an unfavorable FIFO impact when crude oil prices decrease. In order to derive the refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel adjusted for FIFO impact, we utilize the total dollar figures for refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact as derived above and divide by the applicable number of crude oil throughput barrels for the period. We believe that refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact and refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel adjusted for FIFO impact are important to enable investors to better understand and evaluate the petroleum business' ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in the review of our overall financial, operational and economic performance.\nThe calculation of refining margin, refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact, refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel, and refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact per crude oil throughput barrel (each a non-GAAP financial measure), including a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nPetroleum Segment Operating Data Three Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 (in millions) Net sales $ 1,458.2 $ 1,423.5 Operating costs and expenses: Cost of materials and other 1,217.7 1,201.3 Direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization and major scheduled turnaround expenses as reflected below) 93.0 89.2 Major scheduled turnaround expenses — 12.9 Depreciation and amortization 32.7 33.3 Gross profit 114.8 86.8 Add: Direct operating expenses (exclusive of depreciation and amortization and major scheduled turnaround expenses as reflected below) 93.0 89.2 Major scheduled turnaround expenses — 12.9 Depreciation and amortization 32.7 33.3 Refining margin 240.5 222.2 FIFO impact, (favorable) unfavorable (20.4 ) 0.3 Refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact $ 220.1 $ 222.5\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 Total crude oil throughput barrels per day 177,699 214,369 Days in the period 90 90 Total crude oil throughput barrels 15,992,910 19,293,210\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 (in millions, except for $ per barrel data) Refining margin $ 240.5 $ 222.2 Divided by: crude oil throughput barrels 16.0 19.3 Refining margin per crude oil throughput barrel $ 15.04 $ 11.52\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 (in millions, except for $ per barrel data) Refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact $ 220.1 $ 222.5 Divided by: crude oil throughput barrels 16.0 19.3 Refining margin adjusted for FIFO impact per crude oil throughput barrel $ 13.77 $ 11.54 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA represents net income attributable to CVR Energy stockholders before consolidated (i) interest expense and other financing costs, net of interest income, (ii) income tax expense (benefit), and (iii) depreciation and amortization, less the portion of these adjustments attributable to non-controlling interest. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for, as applicable, consolidated (i) FIFO impact (favorable) unfavorable; (ii) major scheduled turnaround expenses (that many of our competitors capitalize and thereby exclude from their measures of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA); (iii) (gain) loss on derivatives, net and (iv) current period settlements on derivative contracts, less the portion of these adjustments attributable to non-controlling interest. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be substituted for net income (loss) or cash flow from operations. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA enable investors to better understand and evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in reviewing our overall financial, operational and economic performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation, since each company may define these terms differently. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA represent EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA that is attributable to CVR Energy stockholders.\nA reconciliation of net income attributable to CVR Energy stockholders to EBITDA and EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 (in millions) Net income attributable to CVR Energy stockholders $ 66.2 $ 22.2 Add: Interest expense and other financing costs, net of interest income 26.9 26.8 Income tax expense 20.8 14.8 Depreciation and amortization 51.9 51.1 Adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interest (36.4 ) (35.9 ) EBITDA 129.4 79.0 Add: FIFO impact, (favorable) unfavorable (20.4 ) 0.3 Major scheduled turnaround expenses — 12.9 Gain on derivatives, net (59.3 ) (12.2 ) Current period settlement on derivative contracts (1) 13.7 1.2 Adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interest 22.5 (0.8 ) Adjusted EBITDA $ 85.9 $ 80.4 Petroleum and Nitrogen Fertilizer EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA by operating segment represents net income (loss) before (i) interest expense and other financing costs, net of interest income, (ii) income tax expense and (iii) depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA by operating segment represents EBITDA by operating segment adjusted for, as applicable (i) FIFO impact (favorable) unfavorable; (ii) major scheduled turnaround expenses (that many of our competitors capitalize and thereby exclude from their measures of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA); (iii) (gain) loss on derivatives, net; and (iv) current period settlements on derivative contracts.\nWe present Adjusted EBITDA by operating segment because it is the starting point for CVR Refining’s and CVR Partners’ determination of available cash for distribution. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by operating segment are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be substituted for net income (loss) as a measure of performance. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by operating segment enable investors to better understand CVR Refining’s and CVR Partners’ ability to make distributions to their common unitholders, help investors evaluate our ongoing operating results and allow for greater transparency in reviewing our overall financial, operational and economic performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation, since each company may define these terms differently.\nA reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA and EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA for the Petroleum and Nitrogen Fertilizer segments for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 (in millions) Petroleum: Petroleum net income $ 146.7 $ 67.0 Add: Interest expense and other financing costs, net of interest income 11.3 11.2 Income tax expense — — Depreciation and amortization 33.7 34.1 Petroleum EBITDA 191.7 112.3 Add: FIFO impact, (favorable) unfavorable (20.4 ) 0.3 Major scheduled turnaround expenses — 12.9 Gain on derivatives, net (59.3 ) (12.2 ) Current period settlements on derivative contracts (1) 13.7 1.2 Adjusted Petroleum EBITDA $ 125.7 $ 114.5\nThree Months Ended\nMarch 31, 2018 2017 (in millions) Nitrogen Fertilizer: Nitrogen fertilizer net loss $ (19.1 ) $ (10.3 ) Add: Interest expense and other financing costs, net 15.7 15.7 Income tax expense — — Depreciation and amortization 16.4 15.4 Nitrogen Fertilizer EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA $ 13.0 $ 20.8",
