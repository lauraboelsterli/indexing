Verizon gained 3 percent after its profit beat expectations.\nEarnings have been a bright spot, diverting attention from geopolitical and trade worries and, lately, a jump in 10-year U.S. government bond yields.\nAbout 18 percent of S&P 500 companies have reported first-quarter results as of Monday, with 78 percent topping profit estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nStrong reports have pushed up analysts’ estimates for the quarter’s earnings growth to nearly 20 percent, from 18.6 percent at the start of the earnings season, the strongest in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nAt 7:47 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 155 points, or 0.63 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were up 15.5 points, or 0.58 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 36.75 points, or 0.55 percent.\nOne dampener was Google-parent Alphabet, which dipped 0.5 percent after its profit beat Wall Street estimates but its costs rose.\nNot all results from Dow components were strong. Travelers fell 2 percent after the insurer’s profit missed estimates. 3M fell 3.2 percent after its results.\nYields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. bonds were 2.9715 percent. They came within striking distance of 3 percent on Monday due to a growing supply of government debt and accelerating inflation as commodity prices gained.\nOil rose above $75 a barrel to its highest since November 2014, supported by OPEC-led production cuts, strong demand and the prospect of renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran.
