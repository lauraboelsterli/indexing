    "text": "155 COMMENTS When the newly christened Tampa Bay Devil Rays started selling tickets for their 1998 debut season, they threw a party outside their St. Petersburg ballpark with players on hand to greet fans and sign autographs. They sold out exactly one game.\n“That was a pretty big alarm bell,” one former team official said.\nAbout 15 years later, the Miami Marlins finally built a stadium after a long battle, signing a crop of big-name free agents to mark the occasion. Then tickets went on sale, and the Marlins didn’t fill the seats for their series against the Boston Red Sox, an opponent with large support in South Florida.\n“We knew there could be trouble,” former Marlins president David Samson said.\nThe 25-year baseball experiment in Florida has not gone according to plan. The Marlins have ranked among the bottom five teams in average attendance in 18 of the last 19 seasons and haven’t reached the playoffs since 2003. The Rays—they dropped the “Devil” in 2008—have ranked last at the box office in six consecutive seasons.\nNow the two organizations are at a moment of reckoning, as both teams face scrutiny after a winter in which they traded away talent to cut costs and rebuild. In February, the MLB Players Association filed a grievance against four teams accusing them of failing to spend revenue-sharing money appropriately. This included both Florida clubs.\n“Let’s call it for what it is,” said one person familiar with the union’s thinking. “Baseball in Florida has been a disaster for Major League Baseball.”\nA Miami Marlins fan looks on from the stands during a recent game at Marlins Park.

Florida’s large population of baseball-crazed Latin Americans boded well. Florida has hosted spring training for a century.\nMLB says it remains committed to Florida. In a February news conference, commissioner Rob Manfred said, “I believe that both Florida franchises can be a success in the right circumstances.”\nThe Marlins believe they have the right circumstances following the $1.2 billion sale of the team to a group led by businessman Bruce Sherman and Derek Jeter, the retired New York Yankees shortstop. They will try to accomplish what Wayne Huizenga, John Henry and Jeffrey Loria—all previous Marlins owners—failed to do: turn the Marlins into a success.\nTheir first moves did not ingratiate the new owners with fans. This offseason, the Marlins traded Giancarlo Stanton, Marcell Ozuna, Christian Yelich and Dee Gordon, breaking up a talented young core. They have averaged 13,172 fans so far in 2018, with three games drawing under 7,000. Under the new regime, the Marlins have changed how they announce their attendance in the name of transparency, reporting only tickets sold, not giveaways.\nMiami fans have gone through this before. After the Marlins won the World Series in 1997, Huizenga orchestrated perhaps the most infamous fire sale in sports history, citing poor revenues as he dismantled the team. (Huizenga died last month at the age of 80.) Later, under Loria, the team dumped talent twice more, including after winning a second title in 2003.\n“People in their minds are going, ‘Here we go again, it’s the same old thing,’” Jeter said. “But it’s not the same thing. We’re trying to fix something that’s been broken. In order for us to do that, there needed to be some changes.”\nAfter a successful inaugural campaign in 1993 that attracted more than 3 million fans, the Marlins struggled to draw to the football stadium where they initially played. Don Smiley, a top executive under Huizenga, says the strike of 1994 crushed momentum. Weather was a frequent concern.\n“If it was raining in Fort Lauderdale and nice at the ballpark, that was a really hard message to communicate,” Smiley said.\nThe new Marlins Park has a retractable roof, but the market problems remain. South Florida has a large proportion of transplants with previous sports allegiances from other cities. Plenty of people have disposable income, but “those people are gone all summer long,” Samson said.\n“South Florida has some fundamental issues with baseball that are 25 years old,” Samson said. “I’m not sure how that changes, but I’m hopeful as a resident and baseball fan in South Florida.”\nThe onus now falls on Jeter to turn around what he admits “is a complicated history.” The Marlins launched a campaign called dímelo, Spanish for “talk to me,” in which fans can provide feedback on a variety of topics. Two booths have been installed at Marlins Park for people to record a video message with their thoughts. The team has also added 24 new corporate sponsors.\n“We bet on Miami, the baseball fans, the community,” Jeter said.\nThe Rays have faced problems since Day One. Their ballpark, Tropicana Field, “was outdated before the Rays even started playing,” team president Matt Silverman said. (It was built eight years before the creation of the Rays in an effort to entice an existing team to relocate there.)\nThey also had a string of missteps in the early-going that alienated some fans and business partners.\n“When the Rays started, there was never that sense of being involved and giving back to the community,” said Outback Steakhouse co-founder Robert Basham, a former minority owner of the Rays.\nBasham and four others sold their stake to current owner Stuart Sternberg. The Rays won the pennant in 2008 and averaged 91 victories over a six-season span. Attendance improved just marginally, forcing the Rays to turn their attention to “some structural issues within our marketplace that have been there since the beginning of the franchise,” Silverman said.\nThat means securing a new stadium not in St. Pete, but in Tampa. Only about 20% of the market lives within a 30-minute drive of Tropicana Field, compared to 50% in the proposed site for a new ballpark in the Ybor City neighborhood.\nThe Rays believe stadium location is their biggest problem, pointing to their solid local television ratings. Other sports have enjoyed success in the area: The NHL’s Lightning sell out every game at their Tampa arena—19,092 fans a night, or 22% more than the Rays’ average 2017 attendance.\nOdrisamer Despaigne of the Miami Marlins pitches against the Chicago Cubs at Marlins Park.

Most baseball teams receive 70% of their ticket sales from businesses and 30% from individuals. The Rays are the exact opposite.\n“It’s a pivotal point for our franchise,” Silverman said. “This new stadium effort is a fresh opportunity for the community to show that it values a baseball team.”\nTampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn said that if the Rays don’t contribute at least half of the anticipated $800 million necessary for a stadium, it will “make an already difficult deal impossible to do.” At this point, Buckhorn said, the Rays have committed to put in $150 million, though additional support from the business community could cause that number to climb.\n“We don’t need the Rays to be successful,” Buckhorn said. “We want to keep them here, but this city will not wither and die whether or not the Rays stay.”\nWrite to Jared Diamond at jared.diamond@wsj.com",
