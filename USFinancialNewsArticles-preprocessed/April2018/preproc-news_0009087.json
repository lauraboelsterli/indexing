    "text": "6 COMMENTS PINK MAY be one of the biggest colors in menswear at the moment, but brands still treat it like a dirty word. Todd Snyder’s elevated sweat separates come in “rose quartz.” Steven Alan makes Japanese cotton T-shirts in “putty.” The Gap offers chinos in “dusty mauve.” Officine Générale sent a shirt down its spring runway that is being marketed as “faded rose.” Theory is selling a fleece hoodie in “galah,” which, as any amateur birder knows, is a pinky-gray-breasted cockatoo native to Australia. \nNo matter what you call the color or how persistently it infiltrates fashion, it remains a hard sell for certain men. While most women can comfortably think pink, as the 1957 musical “Funny Face” urges in song, guys tend to feel more like Steve Buscemi in “Reservoir Dogs,” protesting, “Why am I Mr. Pink?”\nStill, our notion of pink as a feminine color is a fairly recent construct. Throughout the Victorian era, pink and blue were interchangeable nursery colors, and a 1918 article in Earnshaw’s Infants’ Department, a clothing trade publication, advised, “Pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy.”\nToday, bold guys are reclaiming the color’s more gender-neutral roots. Across pop culture, men like John Legend and Wes Anderson are going beyond the classic pink oxford shirt—a Brooks Brothers staple since the early 1900s and a ubiquitously safe way for men to wear the color—to flaunt pieces from bright pink ties to full pink suits. At this year’s Australian Open, athletes including Rafael Nadal wore hot pink Nike gear designed to project aggression. As Sam Shipley, apparel design director for Nike Co urt, put it, “We talked a lot about driving energy through confidence in pink.”\nMen who subvert pink’s gendered stereotype appear assured because they’re going against the grain. Stylist Ilaria Urbinati, who dresses men including Dwayne Johnson and Donald Glover, said, “I think it takes a really masculine guy to wear pink.” Ms. Urbinati’s clients feed off the rewards of taking the risk: “I push them into things, but then they go out into the world and they get compliments and they’re like, ‘What else you got?’” Recently Mr. Glover rose to the rosé challenge by successfully wearing a sweater the color of poached shrimp on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,” with maroon pants, no less. \nFor men who are ready to take a chance on pink (or “gypsum” or “roseate spoonbill”), Ms. Urbinati counsels putting a blush sweater with navy or slate wool pants. Combining the color with black can read ’80s New Wave. “There is nothing cooler than a pink hoodie under a topcoat, worn with sneakers,” suggested designer Todd Snyder (who said he pairs his with a camel coat). Don’t go monochromatic: Wearing one pink piece at a time avoids an unfortunate allover bubble-gum look. \nThe most current shade—soft “millennial” pink, familiar to anyone who spends time on Instagram—feels more grounded in the naturalism of the American Southwest than the high-octane neon of “Miami Vice.” But whatever shade you go for, and whatever stigma-deflecting name it’s been given, studies have shown that pink stimulates a mood-lifting response. Robert Green, a Chicago product designer who favors pink shirts, counts himself as a beneficiary. “It’s fresh,” he said. “It’s a happy color. It’s positive.” \nWilder Roses Photo: F.
