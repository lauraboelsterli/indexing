FILE PHOTO - Russian President Vladimir Putin and State Duma speaker Sergei Naryshkin attend a wreath-laying ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of the Nazi German invasion, by the Kremlin walls in Moscow, Russia, June 22, 2016. REUTERS/Grigory Dukor \n“Washington has become fixated with the fight against a non-existent, so-called Russian threat. This has reached such proportions and acquired such absurd characteristics that it’s possible to speak of a return to the dark times of the Cold War,” the spy chief said, speaking at a security conference in Moscow.
