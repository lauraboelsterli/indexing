    "text": "Earnings per diluted share: $1.52 from net income, $1.61 from adjusted operating income* ROE 21.1 percent and adjusted operating ROE* 10.3 percent for the trailing twelve months Reported net premiums increased 9 percent in the first quarter\nST. LOUIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (NYSE: RGA), a leading global provider of life reinsurance, reported first-quarter net income of $100.2 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, compared with $145.5 million, or $2.22 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating income* totaled $105.7 million, or $1.61 per diluted share, compared with $122.1 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, the year before. Net foreign currency fluctuations had a favorable effect of $0.09 per diluted share on net income and on adjusted operating income.\nQuarterly Results ($ in thousands, except per share data) 2018 2017 Net premiums $ 2,582,551 $ 2,365,696 Net income 100,230 145,512 Net income per diluted share 1.52 2.22 Adjusted operating income* 105,746 122,065 Adjusted operating income per diluted share* 1.61 1.86 Book value per share 139.64 115.24 Book value per share, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI)* 117.49 94.72 Total assets 60,954,823 53,805,820 * See ‘Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures’ below\nIn the first quarter, consolidated net premiums totaled $2.6 billion, up 9 percent from last year’s first quarter of $2.4 billion, with favorable net foreign currency effects of $79.3 million. Excluding spread-based businesses and the value of associated derivatives, investment income increased 9 percent over year-ago levels, due to an increase in average invested assets and higher variable investment income. The average investment yield, excluding spread businesses, was up 5 basis points from the first quarter of 2017 to 4.46 percent, attributable to higher variable investment income. The average investment yield was 8 basis points higher than the fourth-quarter yield due primarily to a higher level of variable investment income.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was enacted on December 22, 2017, reducing the statutory federal income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, effective January 1, 2018. Due to generating a greater-than-expected portion of earnings in jurisdictions that have higher income tax rates than the U.S. statutory rate, and the inclusion of U.S. tax related to Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, the effective tax rate this quarter was higher than the expected range at 27.3 percent on pre-tax income and 26.7 percent on pre-tax adjusted operating income.\nAnna Manning, president and chief executive officer, commented, “Our operating results were below our expectations this quarter, but this reflects normal volatility of claims that is inherent in our business. As we have pointed out in the past, the nature of our business is such that we can experience some volatility of claims, in both directions, in the short term. However, any volatility tends to even out over longer periods, and our diversified global platform has helped mitigate overall relative volatility in recent periods. We tend to see the highest claims in our first quarters when winter weather and influenza seasons can cause higher claims experience.\n“In this quarter, the biggest source of variability was in our U.S. Individual Mortality business where we had elevated claims, influenced by a severe influenza season and a difficult winter. We also experienced some volatility in the Asia Pacific Traditional segment, attributable to modest swings in underwriting results in a few different countries. Our operations in EMEA and Canada performed well overall. Again, we view the claims experience in the quarter to be a normal part of our business and not indicative of any systemic issues.\n“Reported premium growth was 9 percent, favorably influenced by foreign currency, representing a solid quarter and continued good momentum.\n“We had a fairly active quarter as we deployed approximately $90 million of capital into in-force and other transactions, and we remain well positioned and optimistic about the environment and our pipeline. We ended the quarter with an excess capital position of approximately $1.3 billion, down from the previous quarter. We continue to pursue a balanced approach to capital management through deployment of capital into in-force and other attractive transactions, share repurchases and shareholder dividends. Book value per share at March 31 was $139.64 including AOCI, and $117.49 excluding AOCI.\n“Although our first-quarter earnings were below our expectations, our view of the underlying business fundamentals and intermediate-term financial outlook remain unchanged. Looking forward, we are excited about our ability to serve clients, execute on our strategies and deliver attractive financial returns.”\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nU.S. and Latin America\nTraditional\nThe U.S. and Latin America Traditional segment reported pre-tax income of $2.9 million, compared with $30.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. Pre-tax adjusted operating income totaled $1.2 million for the quarter, compared with $28.0 million in last year’s first quarter. Results for the current quarter reflected elevated claims experience in the Individual Mortality business influenced by a particularly severe influenza season, resulting in a higher frequency of non-large claims. The year-ago period reflected unfavorable experience with a higher number of large claims. Additionally, Group results were modestly below expectations this year, compared with strong results a year ago.\nTraditional net premiums were slightly down from last year’s first quarter to $1,299.4 million, reflecting the modification of a health treaty that occurred in the fourth quarter, as well as decreased individual health premiums due to lower new business volume in that market.\nFinancial Solutions\nThe Asset-Intensive business reported pre-tax income of $47.3 million compared with $85.8 million last year. First-quarter pre-tax adjusted operating income totaled $49.7 million compared with $51.6 million in the prior-year period. Results were negatively affected by lower prepayment income and, to a modest extent, by the effect of lower equity markets during the period, while the prior-year period benefited from favorable interest rate spreads and higher equity markets.\nThe Financial Reinsurance business reported pre-tax income and pre-tax adjusted operating income of $20.2 million, up from $17.8 million the year before, due to strong new business volumes in the latter half of 2017.\nCanada\nTraditional\nThe Canada Traditional segment reported pre-tax income of $23.7 million, compared with $19.3 million the year before. Pre-tax adjusted operating income increased to $25.6 million, from $16.8 million a year ago, attributable to in-line individual mortality experience, contrasted with modestly unfavorable mortality experience the year before. Foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable effect of $1.4 million on pre-tax income and $1.5 million on pre-tax adjusted operating income.\nReported net premiums totaled $252.7 million for the quarter, up 17 percent over $215.8 million in the year-ago period primarily due to a new transaction. Net foreign currency fluctuations had a favorable effect of $10.8 million on net premiums.\nFinancial Solutions\nThe Canada Financial Solutions business segment, which consists of longevity and fee-based transactions, reported first-quarter pre-tax income and pre-tax adjusted operating income of $3.2 million, compared with $3.6 million a year ago, with both periods reflecting favorable longevity experience. Net foreign currency fluctuations favorably affected pre-tax income and pre-tax adjusted operating income by $0.2 million.\nEurope, Middle East and Africa (EMEA)\nTraditional\nThe EMEA Traditional segment reported pre-tax income and pre-tax adjusted operating income of $15.4 million, up from $14.0 million in last year’s first quarter. The current-period results were generally in line as unfavorable underwriting results in the U.K. were offset by favorable underwriting results across the rest of the region. Net foreign currency fluctuations favorably affected pre-tax income and pre-tax adjusted operating income by $1.8 million.\nReported net premiums increased 23 percent from the prior-year period to $375.7 million due to the growth of new and existing treaties. Foreign currency exchange rates favorably affected net premiums by $40.3 million.\nFinancial Solutions\nThe EMEA Financial Solutions business segment, which consists of longevity, asset-intensive and fee-based transactions, reported first-quarter pre-tax income of $39.2 million, compared with $31.9 million in the year-ago period. Pre-tax adjusted operating income totaled $35.9 million, compared with $27.5 million the year before, due to underlying business growth and favorable foreign exchange, while both periods reflect favorable longevity experience. Net foreign currency fluctuations favorably affected pre-tax income by $4.3 million and pre-tax adjusted operating income by $4.0 million.\nAsia Pacific\nTraditional\nThe Asia Pacific Traditional segment's pre-tax income and pre-tax adjusted operating income declined to $22.9 million, from $41.7 million in the prior-year period, due to unfavorable underwriting experience in Asia and a modest loss in Australia, both attributed to normal volatility. In the prior-year period experience was favorable across Asia, with profitable results in Australia. Net foreign currency fluctuations had a favorable effect of $1.0 million on pre-tax income and $0.9 million on pre-tax adjusted operating income.\nReported net premiums increased 22 percent to $589.5 million, with strong growth across Asia, primarily from new and existing treaties across the region. The strong premium growth in Asia was partially offset by a material reduction in premiums in Australia due to the recapture of several treaties that took place in the fourth quarter of last year. Foreign currency exchange rates had a favorable effect of $21.3 million on net premiums.\nFinancial Solutions\nThe Asia Pacific Financial Solutions business segment, which consists of asset-intensive and fee-based transactions, reported first-quarter pre-tax income of $4.0 million, compared with $5.9 million in the prior-year period. Pre-tax adjusted operating income totaled $1.3 million, compared with a pre-tax adjusted operating loss of $0.5 million in the prior-year quarter, attributable to better-than-expected results from a treaty that is in runoff. Net foreign currency fluctuations had a favorable effect of $0.1 million on pre-tax income. Foreign currency exchange rates had an immaterial effect on pre-tax adjusted operating income.\nCorporate and Other\nThe Corporate and Other segment’s pre-tax losses totaled $40.8 million, compared with $42.1 million the year before. Pre-tax adjusted operating losses were $30.9 million versus year-ago pre-tax adjusted operating losses of $26.6 million due to higher project costs and incentive-based compensation expenses. Both revenues and expenses reflected the acquisition of LOGiQ 3 Inc., which closed in the first quarter.\nDividend Declaration\nThe board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.50, payable May 29 to shareholders of record as of May 8.\nEarnings Conference Call\nA conference call to discuss first-quarter results will begin at 11 a.m. Eastern Time on Friday, April 27. Interested parties may access the call by dialing 877-440-5807 (domestic) or 719-325-4821 (international). The access code is 4261076. A live audio webcast of the conference call will be available on the Company’s Investor Relations website at www.rgare.com . A replay of the conference call will be available at the same address for 90 days following the conference call.\nThe Company has posted to its website a Quarterly Financial Supplement that includes financial information for all segments as well as information on its investment portfolio. Additionally, the Company posts periodic reports, press releases and other useful information on its Investor Relations website.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nRGA uses a non-GAAP financial measure called adjusted operating income as a basis for analyzing financial results. This measure also serves as a basis for establishing target levels and awards under RGA’s management incentive programs. Management believes that adjusted operating income, on a pre-tax and after-tax basis, better measures the ongoing profitability and underlying trends of the Company’s continuing operations, primarily because that measure excludes substantially all of the effect of net investment related gains and losses, as well as changes in the fair value of certain embedded derivatives and related deferred acquisition costs. These items can be volatile, primarily due to the credit market and interest rate environment, and are not necessarily indicative of the performance of the Company’s underlying businesses. Additionally, adjusted operating income excludes any net gain or loss from discontinued operations, the cumulative effect of any accounting changes, tax reform and other items that management believes are not indicative of the Company’s ongoing operations. The definition of adjusted operating income can vary by company and is not considered a substitute for GAAP net income.\nBook value per share excluding the impact of AOCI is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes is important in evaluating the balance sheet in order to ignore the effects of unrealized amounts primarily associated with mark-to-market adjustments on investments and foreign currency translation.\nAdjusted operating income per diluted share is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as adjusted operating income divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Adjusted operating return on equity is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as adjusted operating income divided by average stockholders’ equity excluding AOCI. Similar to adjusted operating income, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures better reflect the ongoing profitability and underlying trends of the Company’s continuing operations, they also serve as a basis for establishing target levels and awards under RGA’s management incentive programs.\nReconciliations from GAAP net income, book value per share, net income per diluted share and average stockholders’ equity are provided in the following tables. Additional financial information can be found in the Quarterly Financial Supplement on RGA’s Investor Relations website at www.rgare.com in the “Financial Information” section.\nAbout RGA\nReinsurance Group of America, Incorporated (RGA), a Fortune 500 company, is among the leading global providers of life reinsurance and financial solutions, with approximately $3.4 trillion of life reinsurance in force and assets of $61.0 billion as of March 31, 2018.
