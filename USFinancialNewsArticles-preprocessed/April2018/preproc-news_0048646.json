    "text": "April 23, 2018 / 6:25 AM / Updated 2 hours ago Gemalto says post-Brexit UK passport contract will create jobs, protect data Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nPARIS (Reuters) - Franco-Dutch digital security group Gemalto ( GTO.AS ) said on Monday that its contract to make the new, post-Brexit British passport would create new jobs and that it would ensure citizens’ key data details are protected.

REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes \n“This process will further extend Gemalto’s presence in the UK, where it has operated for the last 25 years and create new jobs, supplementing the 500+ staff which Gemalto already employs in the UK, as well as generating secondary economic benefits in the local communities where Gemalto will be manufacturing the passports,” added the company. \nThe British government last week confirmed that Gemalto - which is in the process of being acquired by French group Thales ( TCFP.PA ) - had beaten De La Rue ( DLAR.L ) to make the new passports, in a contract that will run for 11-1/2 years and has a value of 260 million pounds. \nBritain had also said last week that the contract award would see Gemalto add 70 more jobs to its UK workforce. \nPrime Minister Theresa May said the decision to change British passports from the burgundy shade used by most European Union countries to the traditional dark blue was an expression of British independence and sovereignty. \nBut reports that a foreign firm had won the new passport contract led to criticism from some politicians and newspapers that the government was being unpatriotic.
