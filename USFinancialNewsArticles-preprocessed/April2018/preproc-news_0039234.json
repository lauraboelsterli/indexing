    "text": "First quarter reported net sales of $935.5 million up 5.5%;\nOrganic net sales up 0.8%;\nFirst quarter reported diluted EPS of $2.82;\nNon-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS of $2.79 excludes $0.07 net gain related to net debt items and $0.04 charge related to U.S. tax legislation\nKENOSHA, Wis.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Snap-on Incorporated (NYSE: SNA), a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of tools, equipment, diagnostics, repair information and systems solutions for professional users performing critical tasks, today announced operating results for the first quarter of 2018.\nNet sales of $935.5 million in the quarter increased $48.4 million, or 5.5%, from 2017 levels, reflecting a $7.2 million, or 0.8%, organic sales gain, $14.3 million of acquisition-related sales, and $26.9 million of favorable foreign currency translation. Operating earnings before financial services in the quarter of $177.7 million, or 19.0% of sales, compared to $170.2 million, or 19.2% of sales, last year. Financial services revenue in the quarter of $83.0 million increased $6.2 million from 2017 levels; financial services operating earnings of $56.9 million increased $4.4 million from $52.5 million last year. Consolidated operating earnings in the quarter of $234.6 million, or 23.0% of revenues (net sales plus financial services revenue), compared to $222.7 million, or 23.1% of revenues, last year. Other income (expense) - net includes a net gain of $5.5 million associated with a treasury lock settlement gain of $13.3 million related to the issuance of debt, partially offset by $7.8 million of expense related to the early extinguishment of debt (together “net debt items”). The first quarter effective income tax rate of 26.2% in 2018 was increased by 120 basis points as a result of an additional $2.6 million charge related to the implementation of U.S. tax legislation (“tax charge”). Excluding the tax charge, the effective tax rate, as adjusted, was 25.0%. The first quarter effective income tax rate was 30.7% in 2017. Net earnings in the first quarter of 2018 were $163.0 million, or $2.82 per diluted share, compared to net earnings of $141.6 million, or $2.39 per diluted share a year ago. Excluding the above-mentioned net debt items and tax charge, net earnings, as adjusted, were $161.5 million in 2018, or $2.79 per diluted share.\nSee “Non-GAAP Measures” below for a definition of, and further explanation about, organic sales and measures, as adjusted, excluding the net debt items and tax charge.\nAt the beginning of fiscal 2018, Snap-on adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The adoption did not have a significant impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements. Among the changes, the adoption resulted in an increase in inventories – net in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets of $20.9 million, but did not have any impact on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nAt the beginning of fiscal 2018, Snap-on also adopted ASU No. 2017-07, Compensation – Retirement Benefits (Topic 715) – Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost. The ASU requires changes be applied retrospectively; as such, certain prior period year amounts have been restated to reflect this adoption and conform to the 2018 presentation.\n“We are encouraged with our first quarter 2018 results, which were achieved despite continuing headwinds in the Snap-on Tools Group,” said Nick Pinchuk, Snap-on chairman and chief executive officer. “Net sales growth in both the Commercial and Industrial Group and the Repair Systems and Information Group provides ongoing validation of the fundamental strength of Snap-on’s value proposition of making work easier for serious professionals and demonstrates continued progress along our defined runways for coherent growth. At the same time, year-over-year growth in earnings per diluted share reflects both the ongoing commitment to our Snap-on Value Creation Processes and the benefits for our corporation of the new tax legislation in the United States. Finally, these results would not have been possible without the dedication and capability of our franchisees and associates worldwide; I thank them for their continuing commitment and extraordinary contributions.”\nSegment Results\nCommercial & Industrial Group segment sales of $331.6 million in the quarter increased $32.9 million, or 11.0%, from 2017 levels, reflecting a $6.0 million, or 1.9%, organic sales gain, $13.6 million of acquisition-related sales, and $13.3 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales increase primarily includes higher sales to customers in critical industries as well as gains in the segment’s European-based hand tools business and Asia/Pacific operations, partially offset by lower sales of power tools.\nOperating earnings of $46.5 million in the period increased $4.6 million from 2017 levels, and the operating margin (operating earnings as a percentage of segment sales) of 14.0% was unchanged from 2017.\nSnap-on Tools Group segment sales of $404.7 million in the quarter decreased $4.7 million, or 1.1%, from 2017 levels, reflecting an $11.4 million, or 2.7%, organic sales decline, partially offset by $6.7 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales decrease includes lower sales in the company’s U.S. franchise operations, which was offset in part by gains in the company’s international franchise operations.\nOperating earnings of $68.9 million in the period decreased $1.4 million from 2017 levels, and the operating margin of 17.0% compared to 17.2% a year ago.\nRepair Systems & Information Group segment sales of $337.0 million in the quarter increased $18.2 million, or 5.7%, from 2017 levels, reflecting an $8.4 million, or 2.6%, organic sales gain, $0.7 million of acquisition-related sales, and $9.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation. The organic sales gain includes higher sales of diagnostic and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers and increased sales to OEM dealerships; sales of undercar equipment were essentially flat.\nOperating earnings of $85.8 million in the period increased $6.7 million from 2017 levels, and the operating margin of 25.5% improved 70 basis points from 24.8% a year ago.\nFinancial Services operating earnings of $56.9 million on revenue of $83.0 million in the quarter compared to operating earnings of $52.5 million on revenue of $76.8 million a year ago. Originations of $247.3 million in the first quarter decreased $17.3 million, or 6.5%, from 2017 levels.\nCorporate expenses of $23.5 million in the quarter compared to $21.1 million last year.\nOutlook\nSnap-on expects to make continued progress in 2018 along its defined runways for coherent growth, leveraging capabilities already demonstrated in the automotive repair arena and developing and expanding its professional customer base, not only in automotive repair, but in adjacent markets, additional geographies and other areas, including extending in critical industries, where the cost and penalties for failure can be high. In pursuit of these initiatives, Snap-on expects that capital expenditures in 2018 will be in a range of $90 million to $100 million, of which $18.0 million was incurred in the first quarter.\nAs a result of the recently enacted tax legislation in the U.S., Snap-on currently anticipates that its full year 2018 effective income tax rate will be in a range of 24% to 25%.\nConference Call and Webcast on April 19, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. Central Time\nA discussion of this release will be webcast on Thursday, April 19, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. Central Time, and a replay will be available for at least 10 days following the call.

Management evaluates the company’s sales performance based on organic sales growth, which primarily reflects growth from the company’s existing businesses as a result of increased output, customer base and geographic expansion, new product development and/or pricing, and excludes sales contributions from acquired operations the company did not own as of the comparable prior-year reporting period. The company’s organic sales disclosures also exclude the effects of foreign currency translation as foreign currency translation is subject to volatility that can obscure underlying business trends. Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measure of organic sales is meaningful to investors as it provides them with useful information to aid in identifying underlying growth trends in our businesses and facilitating comparisons of our sales performance with prior periods.\nIn addition, for the first quarter of 2018, the company is including net earnings and diluted earnings per share, both as adjusted to exclude a net gain of $5.5 million ($4.1 million after tax) associated with a treasury lock settlement gain of $13.3 million related to the issuance of debt, partially offset by a $7.8 million expense related to the early extinguishment of debt. For the first quarter 2018, the company is also including net earnings, diluted earnings per share and effective tax rate, all as adjusted, to exclude the impact of an additional $2.6 million charge related to the implementation of U.S. tax legislation. Management believes that these are unusual events and therefore the non-GAAP financial measures adjusted to exclude them provide more meaningful year-over-year comparisons of the company’s 2018 operating performance. For a reconciliation of the adjusted metrics, see “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.\nAbout Snap-on\nSnap-on Incorporated is a leading global innovator, manufacturer and marketer of tools, equipment, diagnostics, repair information and systems solutions for professional users performing critical tasks.
