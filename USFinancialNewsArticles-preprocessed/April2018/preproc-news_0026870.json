    "text": "April 13, 2018 / 10:49 AM / Updated 7 minutes ago Russia on Skripal - no confirmation of poison origin in new report Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nMOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Friday a report by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) did not confirm the origin of the poison used against former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov speaks during a meeting with his North Korean counterpart Ri Yong Ho in Moscow, Russia April 10, 2018. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin \nHe said the report only confirmed the composition of the substance and that Britainâ€™s claim that the OPCW report confirms its position on the Skripal case is overstated.
