    "text": "RIO DE JANEIRO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- H.I.G. Capital (\"H.I.G.\"), a leading global private equity investment firm with $25 billion of equity capital under management, is pleased to announce that one of its affiliates has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Elekeiroz S.A. (“Elekeiroz” or the “Company”), a leading chemicals manufacturer in Brazil, from its controlling shareholder Itaúsa –Investimentos Itaú S.A. (“Itaúsa”), one of Brazil’s largest conglomerates that, among its portfolio companies, controls Itaú-Unibanco Holding S.A., Latin America’s largest bank by assets. H.I.G. will acquire 96.5% of the Company’s shares from Itaúsa and plans to acquire the remaining shares as soon as possible. Elekeiroz, which is listed on the São Paulo stock exchange, generated sales of over R$975 million in 2017.\nFounded in 1894 in the state of São Paulo, Elekeiroz is the sole producer of oxo-alcohols in Latin America and the largest producer of plasticizers in Brazil. With vertically integrated production and proximity to all main customers, the Company benefits from significant cost advantages.\nFernando Marques Oliveira, Managing Director and Head of H.I.G. Latin America, said: “We are very much looking forward to working with Elekeiroz. The management team has done a terrific job in building a leadership position across all its products and H.I.G. will now support the Company in its organic and inorganic growth plans as well as cost efficiency projects. We are especially pleased to have the opportunity to work alongside Itaúsa in structuring this transaction to unlock value in an asset which is no longer part of their investment priorities. This transaction demonstrates the ability of H.I.G. to partner with leading groups in Brazil to tailor transactions to meet their specific needs.”\n“It is very exciting for us to partner with H.I.G., that, with its longstanding track record of value creation and the collaborative nature of its investment team, can significantly add to the Company’s ambitious projects going forward,” said Marcos De Marchi, Elekeiroz’s CEO.\nMr. De Marchi and Elekeiroz’s management team, responsible for leading Elekeiroz during the last six years, will remain with the Company.\nAbout Elekeiroz\nFounded in 1894 and headquartered in Várzea Paulista – São Paulo, Elekeiroz operates in the chemicals manufacturing market. Through two production sites in Várzea Paulista and Camaçari – Bahia, the Company’s portfolio includes Oxo-Alcohols, Plasticizers, Phthalic & Maleic Anhydrides, Sulfuric Acid and other by-products.
