In addition, Cabot has also commissioned a new production line at its manufacturing facility in Pepinster, Belgium.\nCabot’s masterbatch and conductive compounds business now boasts a comprehensive range of black masterbatches from five manufacturing locations throughout Europe, Middle East, Asia and North America. After more than 50 years of producing masterbatches and conductive compounds, Cabot now has full service manufacturing and sales capabilities in the North American region to serve both global and regional customers.\n“Cabot has long been recognized as a leader and innovator in the masterbatch and conductive compounds space,” said Thomas Estienne, general manager, Cabot Specialty Compounds North America. “We have the expertise in carbon black design and production technology, as well as significant experience in carbon black dispersion for a wide range of plastic resins.
