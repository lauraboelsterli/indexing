But there’s obviously rising costs.”\nThe yield on U.S. 10-year Treasuries dipped below the 3 percent level as buyers emerged following a sell-off fueled by worries over growing U.S. debt issuance and rising costs.\n“It gives investors a little encouragement that rates aren’t going to be running sky high, but the market’s acting great just on good earnings,” said Bradshaw.\nAt 3:02PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 305.26 points, or 1.27 percent, to 24,389.09, the S&P 500 gained 35.82 points, or 1.36 percent, to 2,675.22 and the Nasdaq Composite added 137.33 points, or 1.96 percent, to 7,141.06.\nSo far, 45 percent of S&P 500 companies have reported first-quarter earnings, with 79.7 percent beating consensus estimates. Analysts see 23.1 percent earnings growth for the quarter, based on a blend of actual and estimated results.\nAmazon shares were up 4.3 percent in advance of the online retailer’s earnings announcement, expected after the bell.\nGeneral Motors dipped 1.0 percent after the automaker reported a drop in production of high-margin pickup trucks, despite posting higher-than-expected profit.\nUnited Parcel Service shares rose 4.1 percent after the world’s largest package delivery company posted higher first-quarter profit and strong volumes despite cost and weather headwinds.\nVisa also helped lift the tech sector, advancing 4.9 percent following the payments network’s better-than-expected profit and earnings forecast raise.\nUnion Pacific shares fell 2.1 percent after the No. 1 U.S. railroad operator cautioned on a key operating metric, sending the Dow Jones Transportation Average down 0.66 percent.\nAT&T shares slumped 5.2 percent after it reported a loss of subscribers from its pay TV business.\nIn economic news, new orders for durable goods unexpectedly dropped in March as demand for machinery registered its biggest decline in more than two years, according to the Commerce Department. However, the Labor Department reported initial claims for unemployment fell to their lowest level since 1969, suggesting the labor market is at or near full employment.\nAdvancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 2.26-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.06-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\nReporting by Stephen Culp; Editing by Dan Grebler\n ",
