For more information, go to www.conocophillips.com .\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE \"SAFE HARBOR\" PROVISIONS OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements relate to future events and anticipated results of operations, business strategies, and other aspects of our operations or operating results. In many cases you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"believe,\" \"continue,\" \"could,\" \"intend,\" \"may,\" \"plan,\" \"potential,\" \"predict,\" \"should,\" \"will,\" \"expect,\" \"objective,\" \"projection,\" \"forecast,\" \"goal,\" \"guidance,\" \"outlook,\" \"effort,\" \"target\" and other similar words. However, the absence of these words does not mean that the statements are not forward-looking. Where, in any forward-looking statement, ConocoPhillips expresses an expectation or belief as to future results, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis. However, there can be no assurance that such expectation or belief will result or be achieved. The actual results of operations can and will be affected by a variety of risks and other matters including, but not limited to changes in commodity prices; changes in expected levels of oil and gas reserves or production; operating hazards, drilling risks, unsuccessful exploratory activities; difficulties in developing new products and manufacturing processes; unexpected cost increases or technical difficulties in constructing, maintaining, or modifying company facilities; international monetary conditions and exchange rate fluctuations; our ability to complete the sale of our announced dispositions on the timeline currently anticipated, if at all; potential liability for remedial actions under existing or future environmental regulations; potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation; limited access to capital or significantly higher cost of capital related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets; and general domestic and international economic and political conditions; as well as changes in tax, environmental and other laws applicable to our business. Other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements include other economic, business, competitive and/or regulatory factors affecting our business generally as set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Unless legally required, ConocoPhillips undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180405005705/en/\nConocoPhillips\nDaren Beaudo, 281-293-2073 (media)\ndaren.beaudo@conocophillips.com\nor\nAndy O’Brien, 281-293-5000 (investors)\nandy.m.obrien@conocophillips.com\nor\nMedia Relations: 281-293-1149\nwww.conocophillips.com/media\nSource: ConocoPhillips",
