    "text": "SAN JOSE, Calif. , April 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) (“Broadcom”) today announced its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase by the Company of up to $12 billion of its common stock. The authorization is effective immediately until November 3, 2019, the end of Broadcom’s fiscal year 2019.\n“The initiation of a stock repurchase program enhances our capital allocation strategy and provides us with a complementary tool to deliver value to our shareholders,” said Tom Krause, Broadcom’s Chief Financial Officer. “We are maintaining our policy of delivering 50% of trailing 12-month free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends while adding the ability to use the balance of our free cash flow not only for acquisitions but also for opportunistic buybacks,” continued Mr. Krause.\nShare repurchases may be made through a variety of methods, including open market or privately negotiated transactions. The timing and number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. Broadcom’s capital return program does not obligate it to repurchase any specific number of shares or continue a dividend for any fixed period, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\nAbout Broadcom Inc.\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a leading designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of digital and analog semiconductor connectivity solutions.
