Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak gestures as he speaks during a rally against U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, in Putrajaya, Malaysia December 22, 2017. REUTERS/Lai Seng Sin \nNajib will make the announcement via state broadcaster RTM, state-linked Berita Harian reported, without citing the source of information. The Star newspaper also reported the same. \nNajib arrived at his office earlier on Friday to chair a meeting of cabinet ministers, state news agency Bernama reported. \nNajib’s five-year term officially ends on June 24, but the prime minister can dissolve parliament anytime before the end of his term with the king’s assent and call an election.
