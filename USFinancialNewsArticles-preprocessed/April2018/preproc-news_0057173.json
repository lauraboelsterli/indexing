    "text": "DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CoreSite Realty Corporation (NYSE:COR), a premier provider of secure, reliable, high-performance data center and interconnection solutions across the U.S., today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nQuarterly and Subsequent Highlights\nFirst-quarter total operating revenues were $129.6 million, a 12.8% increase year over year First-quarter net income per diluted share was $0.59, a 22.9% increase year over year First-quarter funds from operations (“FFO”) was $1.27 per diluted share and unit, a 12.4% increase year over year Commenced 81,636 net rentable square feet (NRSF) of new and expansion leases representing $16.2 million of annualized GAAP rent at an average rate of $184 per square foot Renewed leases with annualized GAAP rent of $20.2 million, with rent growth of 5.6% on a cash basis and 11.5% on a GAAP basis, resulting in rental churn of 1.9% in the first quarter Executed 136 new and expansion data center leases for 29,624 NRSF, representing $7.1 million of annualized GAAP rent at an average rate of $239 per square foot, including 47 new customer logos On April 19, 2018, CoreSite closed on an amended and expanded credit facility with total borrowing capacity of $1.05 billion under all arrangements with its syndicate of banks, and extended the maturity of its credit line to 2022 On April 20, 2018, CoreSite closed on the acquisition of U.S. Colo, a carrier-neutral, network-dense colocation provider, located in Los Angeles, California, for approximately $8.6 million. The acquisition provides CoreSite with 120+ new customers, increases its economies of scale in downtown Los Angeles, and ends litigation that had been ongoing between CoreSite and U.S. Colo\n“Our financial results demonstrate consistent execution and solid growth, with revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and FFO per share increasing 13%, 13%, and 12% year over year, respectively,” said Paul Szurek, CoreSite’s Chief Executive Officer. “We had a number of positives this quarter, including strong cash rent growth on renewals, solid commencement activity and a 9% year-over-year increase in same-store monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent, all leading to healthy organic growth. While demand remains strong, we entered the quarter with approximately 32% less available capacity in our four largest markets, limiting our sales opportunities for the quarter. The $7.1 million in annualized GAAP rent signed includes 47 new high-quality logos added to our ecosystem. Fortunately, near the end of the quarter, we restored capacity in these markets to more normal levels, which has increased our actionable sales funnel, and our construction pipeline is very active.”\nFinancial Results\nCoreSite’s net income attributable to common shares was $20.3 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $16.3 million, or $0.48 per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net income per diluted share increased 34.1% on a sequential-quarter basis.\nCoreSite’s FFO per diluted share and unit was $1.27 for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of 12.4% compared to $1.13 per diluted share and unit for the three months ended March 31, 2017. FFO per diluted share and unit increased 16.5% on a sequential-quarter basis. Excluding the non-cash expense related to the original issuance costs of CoreSite’s redeemed Preferred Stock in the fourth quarter of 2017, FFO per share increased 7.6% sequentially.\nTotal operating revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2018, were $129.6 million, a 12.8% increase year over year and an increase of 2.9% on a sequential-quarter basis.\nCommencements and Renewals\nCoreSite’s first-quarter data center lease commencements totaled 81,636 NRSF at a weighted average GAAP rental rate of $184 per NRSF, which represents $16.2 million of annualized GAAP rent.\nCoreSite’s renewal leases signed in the first quarter totaled $20.2 million in annualized GAAP rent, comprised of 118,876 NRSF at a weighted-average GAAP rental rate of $170 per NRSF, a 5.6% increase in rent on a cash basis and an 11.5% increase on a GAAP basis. The first-quarter rental churn rate was 1.9%.\nAs a result of renewals and growth in interconnection and power revenues, monthly recurring revenue per cabinet equivalent increased 9.3% over the prior-year period.\nSales Activity\nCoreSite executed 136 new and expansion data center leases representing $7.1 million of annualized GAAP rent during the first quarter, comprised of 29,624 NRSF at a weighted-average GAAP rental rate of $239 per NRSF.\nDevelopment and Acquisition Activity\nDuring the first quarter, CoreSite placed into service 87,263 square feet of turn-key data center capacity at LA2 in Los Angeles and 26,413 square feet of turn-key data center capacity at VA3 Phase 1A in Reston, Virginia.\nIn addition, as of March 31, 2018, CoreSite had a total of 108,151 square feet of turn-key data center capacity under construction and had spent $39.7 million of the estimated $131.1 million required to complete the projects, which consist of the following.\nReston – CoreSite had 49,837 square feet of turn-key data center capacity under construction at VA3 (Phase 1B), inclusive of 9,837 square feet of the infrastructure building to support this phase of the data center campus. As of the end of the first quarter, CoreSite had incurred $31.4 million of the estimated $100.2 million required to complete VA3 Phase 1B and the infrastructure building, and expects to complete development in the first quarter of 2019.\nWashington, D.C. – CoreSite had 24,563 square feet of turn-key data center capacity under construction at DC2. As of the end of the first quarter, CoreSite had spent $5.6 million of the estimated $17.4 million required to complete the project, and expects to complete development in the third quarter of 2018.\nDenver – CoreSite had 15,630 square feet of turn-key data center capacity under construction at DE1. As of the end of the first quarter, CoreSite had spent $1.5 million of the estimated $7.5 million required to complete this expansion, and expects to complete construction in the third quarter of 2018.\nNew York – CoreSite had 18,121 square feet of turn-key data center capacity under construction at NY2. CoreSite has spent $1.2 million of the estimated $6.0 million required to complete this expansion, and expects to complete development in the third quarter of 2018.\nOn April 20, 2018, CoreSite closed on the acquisition of U.S. Colo, a carrier-neutral, network-dense colocation provider, located in Los Angeles, California, for approximately $8.6 million. The acquisition provides CoreSite with more than 120 additional customers, increased economies of scale in downtown Los Angeles, and ends litigation that had been ongoing between CoreSite and U.S. Colo. CoreSite acquired all of the equity interests in U.S. Colo and its affiliates, resulting in the addition of two colocation suites in One Wilshire (LA1) and a colocation space in 800 South Hope Street, cumulatively totaling approximately 30,000 net rentable square feet.\nBalance Sheet and Liquidity\nAs of March 31, 2018, CoreSite had net principal debt outstanding of $988.4 million, correlating to 3.4 times first-quarter annualized adjusted EBITDA.\nOn April 19, 2018, CoreSite closed on an amended and expanded credit facility with $1.05 billion of total borrowing capacity under all arrangements with its syndicate of banks. As a result of the amendment, CoreSite extended its debt maturity profile, with its next tranche of debt not maturing until June 2020.\nThe revolving credit facility amendment provides an incremental $100 million of borrowing capacity, bringing the capacity to $450 million and extends the primary term of the facility to April 2022, with a one-year extension option.\nIn addition, CoreSite entered into a new five-year, $150 million term loan under the amended credit facility. This new loan matures in April 2023, and bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR. CoreSite elected to swap the variable interest rate associated with $75 million of the new term loan facility, to a fixed rate of approximately 4.11%. As of March 31, 2018, pro forma for the financing and related swap, CoreSite’s ratio of fixed versus variable rate debt would be 47% fixed versus 53% variable, in line with CoreSite’s stated goal of maintaining a balance between fixed and variable-priced instruments within its capital structure.\nThe proceeds from the term loan are expected to be used to pay down a portion of the current revolving credit facility balance, to fund continued development across its portfolio, and for general corporate purposes.\nIncluding the increased liquidity resulting from the recent financing transactions, CoreSite had $381.7 million of total available liquidity, including cash on the balance sheet at March 31, 2018.\nDividend\nOn March 9, 2018, CoreSite announced a dividend of $0.98 per share of common stock and common stock equivalents for the first quarter of 2018. The first-quarter dividend was paid on April 16, 2018, to shareholders of record on March 29, 2018.\n2018 Guidance\nCoreSite is maintaining its 2018 guidance of net income attributable to common shares in the range of $2.15 to $2.27 per diluted share. In addition, CoreSite is maintaining its guidance of FFO per diluted share and unit in the range of $4.92 to $5.04, with the difference between net income and FFO being real estate depreciation and amortization.\nThis outlook is based on current economic conditions, internal assumptions about CoreSite’s customer base, and the supply and demand dynamics of the markets in which CoreSite operates. The guidance does not include the impact of any future financing, investment or disposition activities, beyond what has already been disclosed.\nUpcoming Conferences and Events\nCoreSite management will participate in the following investor conferences and events:\nA non-deal roadshow covering the Mid-Atlantic region and Boston on May 8-9, 2018; The J.P.

We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property and undepreciated land and impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO attributable to common shares and units represents FFO less preferred stock dividends declared during the period.\nOur management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, it provides a performance measure that, when compared year over year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.\nWe offer this measure because we recognize that FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, nor the level of capital expenditures and capitalized leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, all of which have real economic effect and could materially impact our financial condition and results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. FFO is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered a measure of liquidity, an alternative to net income, cash provided by operating activities or any other performance measure determined in accordance with GAAP, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions. In addition, our calculations of FFO are not necessarily comparable to FFO as calculated by other REITs that do not use the same definition or implementation guidelines or interpret the standards differently from us. Investors in our securities should not rely on these measures as a substitute for any GAAP measure, including net income.\nReconciliations of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate (EBITDAre) and Adjusted EBITDA: (in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31, December 31, March 31, 2018 2017 2017 Net income $ 28,566 $ 27,008 $ 25,060 Adjustments: Interest expense 7,738 6,635 5,107 Income taxes 33 24 97 Depreciation and amortization 33,776 32,629 32,338 EBITDAre $ 70,113 $ 66,296 $ 62,602 Non-cash compensation 2,626 2,401 1,802 Transaction costs / litigation 139 58 — Adjusted EBITDA $ 72,878 $ 68,755 $ 64,404 EBITDAre is calculated in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). EBITDAre is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses from the sale of depreciated property, and impairment of depreciated property. We calculate adjusted EBITDA by adding our non-cash compensation expense, transaction costs from unsuccessful deals and business combinations and litigation expense to EBITDAre as well as adjusting for the impact of other impairment charges, gains or losses from sales of undepreciated land and gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt. Management uses EBITDAre and adjusted EBITDA as indicators of our ability to incur and service debt. In addition, we consider EBITDAre and adjusted EBITDA to be appropriate supplemental measures of our performance because they eliminate depreciation and interest, which permits investors to view income from operations without the impact of non-cash depreciation or the cost of debt. However, because EBITDAre and adjusted EBITDA are calculated before recurring cash charges including interest expense and taxes, and are not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements of our business, their utilization as a cash flow measurement is limited.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180426005769/en/\nCoreSite\nGreer Aviv\nVice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications\n+1 303-405-1012\n+1 303-222-7276\nGreer.Aviv@CoreSite.com\nSource: CoreSite",
