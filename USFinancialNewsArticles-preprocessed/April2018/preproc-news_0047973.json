    "text": "BEDFORD, Mass., April 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Aware, Inc. (NASDAQ: AWRE), a leading global provider of biometrics software and solutions, today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nRevenue was $2.9 million, a decrease of 30% compared to $4.2 million in the same quarter last year. Operating loss was $0.7 million compared to operating income of $0.2 million in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in revenue and resulting operating loss were primarily due to: (i) lower biometrics software license sales; (ii) lower service revenue, and (iii) no income from a patent arrangement that were partially offset by no cost of software licenses and lower cost of services.\nNet loss was $0.5 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, which compares to net income of $0.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago.\nKevin Russell, Aware's chief executive officer and president, said, \"Our results for the first quarter were below our expectations. We have a number of opportunities that we are working on that we were not able to close in the first quarter. Our pipeline for 2018 looks promising, but we are unable to predict when opportunities will result in revenue. We continue to see interest in our product offerings in the government, commercial and mobile markets.\"\nAware also announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a program authorizing the Company to purchase up to $10 million of its common stock. The shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at management's discretion, depending upon market conditions and other factors. The authorization to repurchase Company stock expires on December 31, 2019.\nAbout Aware\nAware is a leading provider of biometrics software products and development services to governments, system integrators, and solution providers globally.
