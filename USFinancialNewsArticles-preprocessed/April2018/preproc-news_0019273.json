    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Oil trader Pierre Andurand’s hedge fund lost 6.7 percent in the first quarter of 2018 after recouping some of the heavy losses suffered in February, data compiled by HSBC showed.\nAndurand Capital made gains of 3.6 percent in March after losing 14.5 percent in February, following returns of 5.2 percent in January, the data showed.\nA spokesman for Andurand Capital declined to comment.\nMany commodities-focused hedge funds lost out on trades in commodities and energy betting on higher prices in February, a separate report from industry tracker Eurekahedge showed.\nThe price of oil has recovered from February lows, rising by 3.7 percent in the first three months of the year, briefly trading above $71 a barrel, its highest in more than two years.\n(This version of the story refiles to add dropped word “percent” in first paragraph.)\nReporting by Maiya Keidan and Amanda Cooper; Editing by Simon Jessop and Alexander Smith\n ",
