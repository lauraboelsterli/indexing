    "text": "MENLO PARK, Calif., April 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Robert Half International Inc. (NYSE symbol: RHI) today reported revenues and earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, net income was $96 million, or $.78 per share, on revenues of $1.40 billion. Net income for the prior year's first quarter was $79 million, or $.62 per share, on revenues of $1.29 billion.\nIncluded in first-quarter 2018 earnings was a charge to the company's provision for income taxes of $3 million, or $.02 per share, resulting from the estimated impact of additional guidance released pursuant to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Excluding this charge, first-quarter 2018 diluted net income was $.80 per share.\nHarold M. Messmer, Jr., chairman and CEO of Robert Half, said: \"We were pleased with the company's performance in the first quarter, including across-the-board revenue growth in our U.S. and non-U.S. staffing and Protiviti operations, and particularly strong growth in our permanent placement division. These gains were fueled by continued small business optimism, a growing global economy and low unemployment rates in professional occupations.\"\nMessmer added, \"We continue to invest in digital innovation initiatives that will seamlessly integrate our customers' digital experience with our industry-leading traditional professional staffing services.\n\"Robert Half's return on invested capital was 35 percent during the first quarter,\" Messmer said.\nRobert Half management will conduct a conference call today at 5 p.m. EDT.

These statements may be identified by words such as \"estimate\", \"forecast\", \"project\", \"plan\", \"intend\", \"believe\", \"expect\", \"anticipate\", or variations or negatives thereof, or by similar or comparable words or phrases.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe financial results of Robert Half International Inc. (the \"Company\") are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"). To help readers understand the Company's financial performance, the Company supplements its GAAP financial results with revenue growth rates derived from non-GAAP revenue amounts.\nVariations in the Company's financial results include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and billing days. The Company provides \"same billing days and constant currency\" revenue growth calculations to remove the impact of these items. These calculations show the year-over-year revenue growth rates for the Company's lines of business on both a reported basis and also on a same-day, constant-currency basis for global, U.S. and international operations. This information is presented for each of the six most recent quarters. The Company has provided this data because management believes it better reflects the Company's actual revenue growth rates and aids in evaluating revenue trends over time. The Company expresses year-over-year revenue changes as calculated percentages using the same number of billing days and constant currency exchange rates.\nAdditionally, the Company is including non-GAAP financial results for diluted net income per share, which reflects a charge to its provision for income taxes resulting from the estimated impact of additional guidance released by the U.S. government pursuant to TCJA. The Company has provided this data because management believes that it better reflects the Company's first-quarter financial results.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures provided herein may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in the Company's industry, as other companies may calculate such financial results differently. The Company's non-GAAP financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to actual revenue growth derived from revenue amounts presented in accordance with GAAP. The Company does not consider these non-GAAP financial measures to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is provided on the following pages.\nROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC.

The \"As Reported\" revenue growth rates are based upon reported revenues, which include the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to calculate \"Constant Currency\" revenue growth rates, as-reported amounts are retranslated using foreign exchange rates from the prior year's comparable period.\nBilling Days. The \"As Reported\" revenue growth rates are based upon reported revenues. Management calculates a global, weighted-average number of billing days for each reporting period based upon input from all countries and all lines of business. In order to remove the fluctuations caused by comparable periods having different billing days, the company calculates \"same billing day\" revenue growth rates by dividing each comparative period's reported revenues by the calculated number of billing days for that period to arrive at a \"per billing day\" amount. The \"same billing day\" growth rates are then calculated based upon the \"per billing day\" amounts.\nThe term \"same billing days and constant currency\" means that the impact of different billing days has been removed from the constant currency calculation. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP year-over-year revenue growth rates to the \"As Reported\" year-over-year revenue growth rates is included herein on Pages 8-10.\nROBERT HALF INTERNATIONAL INC.
