Medeor's series of product candidates each comprise a unique composition of different types of hematopoietic donor-derived cells, initially based on breakthrough technologies discovered at Stanford University and exclusively licensed by Medeor. These product candidates are designed to produce mixed chimerism, the co-existence of both recipient and donor blood and immune cells in the recipient. For organ transplant recipients, mixed chimerism is intended to allow these patients to achieve donor-specific immune tolerance, prevent transplant organ loss, reduce or eliminate chronic immunosuppressive drug therapy, and thereby improve patient outcomes.
