For corresponding reconciliation of TCE to a GAAP financial measure, see Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures and Calculations of Regulatory Measures. (2) Regulatory capital metrics at March 31, 2018 are preliminary and therefore subject to change. (3) Amounts presented do not reflect certain modifications to the regulatory capital rules proposed by the federal banking agencies in September 2017, which among other things, may increase the risk weighting of certain deferred tax assets from 100% to 250% if the proposed rule becomes effective. (4) Total risk-based capital ratio is the ratio of total risk-based capital divided by risk-weighted assets. (5) Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is the ratio of Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets. (6) Tier 1 leverage ratio is the ratio of Tier 1 capital divided by total average assets, after certain adjustments. Tier 1 leverage ratios are based upon the use of daily averages for all periods presented.
