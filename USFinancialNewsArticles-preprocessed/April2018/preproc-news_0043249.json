    "text": "The following factors could affect Italian markets on Friday.\nReuters has not verified the newspaper reports, and cannot vouch for their accuracy. New items are marked with (*).\nFor a complete list of diary events in Italy please click on .\nPOLITICS Rome, Senate Speaker Maria Elisabetta Alberti Casellati reports results of mandate after meetings with political parties to President Sergio Mattarella.\nThe leader of Italy’s anti-establishment 5-Star Movement said on Thursday he saw the possibility of forming a coalition with the far-right League, but reiterated his refusal to work with its electoral allies.\nECONOMY Italy will slightly raise its forecast for economic growth this year to 1.6 percent from 1.5 percent when the Treasury issues new projections next week, government sources have told Reuters.\nDEBT Treasury announces sale of 6-month BOT bills, with relative amounts to be auctioned on April 26.\nTreasury said on Thursday it would offer up to 3.75 billion euros ($4.63 billion) over three bonds at an auction on April 24.\nBANKS Italian households would bear the brunt of any new bank failure in the country as they own nearly half of the bonds that would be written off in such an event, European Central Bank data showed on Thursday.\nTELECOM ITALIA Activist fund Elliott turned up the volume in its war of words with Vivendi over the French media group’s defence of its strategy for Telecom Italia (TIM), only days before a fight for board seats at Italy’s biggest phone group.\nVivendi’s top investor Vincent Bollore stunned shareholders and board members on Thursday by anointing his son Yannick as chairman only days before the company faces a crucial showdown in Italy.\nENEL Enel said on Thursday it had improved the terms of its offer to buy Brazil’s Eletropaulo by committing to promote and back a capital increase of around 355 million euros.\nSALVATORE FERRAGAMO Chairman Ferruccio Ferragamo reiterated a sale of the company was out of the question. He told Il Sole 24 Ore the group had never been and would never be on sale. “We won’t sell at either 1 (euro) or 10. On this the whole family totally agrees”.\nBANCA POPOLARE DI BARI Italy’s Popolare di Bari has set an ambitious target to reduce its soured debt this year, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, in a move likely to heighten concerns it will need fresh capital.\nSNAM Greece has accepted a 535 million euro ($662 million) offer from a consortium led by Italy’s Snam for a majority stake in gas grid operator DESFA, naming it the “preferred investor”, its privatisation agency said on Thursday.\n(*) SAIPEM Tender bids on two contracts for work given to Saipem and worth around 140 million euros should be relaunched, the CEO of nuclear decommissioning group Sogin said, as reported by MF.\nASTALDI The relaunch of the group could come through a planned capital increase of 300 million euros, Il Sole 24 Ore said. Japan’s IHI and India’s Reliance Infrastructure Limited could be interested in taking up part of the cash call to flank the family, it said. A U.S. private equity is also interested in the group, the paper added.\nGABELLI VALUE FOR ITALY Debuts on AIM segment.\nACEA Annual general meeting (0800 GMT).\nAMPLIFON Annual general meeting (0800 GMT).\nASTM Annual general meeting (0900 GMT).\nATLANTIA Annual general meeting (0900 GMT).\nBREMBO Annual general meeting (0830 GMT).\nWIIT Annual general meeting (0800 GMT).\nSALVATORE FERRAGAMO Annual and extraordinary shareholders’ meetings (0700 GMT).\nYOOX NET-A-PORTER\nAnnual general meeting (0800 GMT).\nFOPE Annual general meeting (0830 GMT).\nEUROTECH Annual general meeting (0700 GMT).\nORSERO Annual general meeting (0830 GMT).\nSERVIZI ITALIA Annual general meeting (0830 GMT).\nPRIMA INDUSTRIE Annual and extraordinary shareholders’ meetings (0800 GMT).\nBB BIOTECH Board meeting on Q1 results.\nMEDIACONTECH Board meeting on FY results.\nFor Italian market data and news, click on codes in brackets:\n20 biggest gainers (in percentage)\n20 biggest losers (in percentage)\nFTSE IT allshare index\nFTSE Mib index\nFTSE Allstars index...\nFTSE Mid Cap index....\nBlock trades\nStories on Italy IT-LEN\nFor pan-European market data and news, click on codes in brackets: European Equities speed guide FTSEurofirst 300 index DJ STOXX index Top 10 STOXX sectors Top 10 EUROSTOXX sectors Top 10 Eurofirst 300 sectors Top 25 European pct gainers Top 25 European pct losers Main stock markets: Dow Jones Wall Street report Nikkei 225 Tokyo report FTSE 100 London report Xetra DAX Frankfurt market stories CAC-40 Paris market stories...
