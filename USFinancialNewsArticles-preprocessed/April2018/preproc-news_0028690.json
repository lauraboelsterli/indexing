    "text": "ABUJA, April 13 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari said on Friday that negotiations with Islamist militants holding girls kidnapped from the northeastern town of Chibok in April 2014 had been set back by disagreements among their abductors.\nHe said “internal differences” within Boko Haram led to a “divergence of voices regarding the outcome of the talks”. The group kidnapped more than 270 girls from their school in Chibok.\nMany have since been released but around 100 are still being held.
