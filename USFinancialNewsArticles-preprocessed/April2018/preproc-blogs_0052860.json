    "text": "3 COMMENTS The New York Times Co. named Cindy Taibi senior vice president and chief information officer this month as the company wraps up a cloud migration and explores employee productivity tools.\nMs. Taibi previously was VP of technology, overseeing back-office enterprise systems, as well as print publishing systems and infrastructure. Over a 37-year career at the Times reaching deep into the pre-digital news age, she served as a developer for the now-gone News Systems group, oversaw IT for the company’s regional media group, and helped architect print advertising and business systems, among other duties.\nNYT CIO Cindy Taibi reports to Chief Technology Officer Nick Rockwell. Photo: The New York Times Co.\n“When I came here, it was all about mainframes and minicomputers,” she said. “There weren’t laptops, there weren’t even really PCs and Macs at the time.” Much of the print production process was manual, and there was no website or mobile app.\nHer appointment comes as the Times completes a roughly 18-month cloud migration project. The “vast majority” of the Times’ applications and services now sit on Google Inc. or Amazon.com Inc.’s clouds. The company has exited three data centers, and is close to leaving its fourth. It will maintain a small data center in its New York headquarters and one in a Norfolk, Va. office for the few workloads that couldn’t make the move.\nThe Times will continue to optimize those applications now that the migration is complete. Ms. Taibi also plans to start evaluating how to update the company’s suite of finance systems such as general ledger and accounts payable.\nMs. Taibi reports to Chief Technology Officer Nick Rockwell. In a blog post announcing Ms. Taibi’s promotion, he said “the CIO role is in the process of being reinvented.”\n“For years, the range of problems and technical solutions available to the CIO were very stable: you bought Office and Outlook, a bunch of Cisco gear and machines from Dell or HP, and then hung on until you had to change the Enterprise Resource Planning system, which you did for a couple of years…and then you got fired,” the blog post said.\nToday, the Times’ adoption of the cloud and serverless computing , in which servers and operating systems are invisible to developers, create new opportunities and challenges.\nMr. Rockwell told CIO Journal in November that serverless is particularly valuable in a market such as news, where content and technology are merging and application deployment speed is increasingly important.\nIt’s the first time in about four years that the company had both a CTO and CIO, Ms. Taibi said.\nIn the CIO role, Ms. Taibi will oversee infrastructure, including networks, phones and computers worldwide, as well as productivity tools and systems that manage finance, HR, legal and compliance. Mr. Rockwell’s role as CTO, in contrast, focuses on products that customers use, according to the blog post.\nMs. Taibi hopes to boost IT’s role in enhancing employee productivity as a range of new technologies enter the market.\n“I want us to have a more active capability around looking at the kind of tools popping up every single day,” she said. “It’s really a very quickly changing space, and I think there’s room for us to engage in it more proactively.”\nMs. Taibi is the first woman to hold the CIO role at the Times. She also co-leads the company’s Women in Technology group, a task force that develops events and initiatives to support the recruitment, retention and advancement of women in technology.\n“It’s true that in tech women are still underrepresented, but at least it’s such a visible issue,” she said. When she started at the Times, “it wasn’t even a topic of conversation.”\nWrite to steven.norton@wsj.com\nShare this: CINDY TAIBI NEW YORK TIMES NICK ROCKWELL Previous Volkswagen Brings Sense of Touch to Virtual Reality Next The Morning Download: New York Times CIO Lived Shift from Mainframes to Serverless Computing",
