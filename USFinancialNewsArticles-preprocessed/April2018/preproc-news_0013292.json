    "text": "Andrew Triggs gave up two runs in 5 2/3 innings, and the Oakland Athletics made the most of their seven hits in a 7-3 win over the Los Angeles Angels on Saturday night at Angel Stadium in Anaheim, Calif.\nTriggs (1-0) allowed only a two-run homer to Justin Upton before coming out of the game with two out in the sixth. He gave up four hits and two walks while striking out six.\nOf Oakland’s seven hits, six of them drove in at least one run. Jed Lowrie homered, and the A’s also got a two-run single by Marcus Semien, an RBI triple by Matt Chapman and an RBI double by Stephen Piscotty.\nUpton and Luis Valbuena each had two hits for Los Angeles.\nOakland jumped on Angels starter JC Ramirez for three runs in the second inning, scoring all three with two out. Piscotty doubled home one run, and Semien singled in two more.\nAngels manager Mike Scioscia decided that was enough for Ramirez, who walked five and threw 55 pitches in the two innings, and sent out reliever Akeel Morris to start the third inning. Ramirez (0-2) has failed to last five innings in either of his two starts, going 4 2/3 innings in a loss to Cleveland in his first outing.\nThe Angels got to within 3-2 in the fourth inning on Upton’s two-run homer, his third of the season, off Triggs. But the A’s got a run back in the fifth on a solo homer by Lowrie.\nValbuena’s second homer of the season in the seventh inning got the Angels back to within one run at 4-3. But Oakland got some breathing room in the eighth on Chapman’s run-scoring triple and an RBI single by Bruce Maxwell for a 6-3 lead.\nThe A’s tacked on another run in the ninth on Matt Olson’s RBI single.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
