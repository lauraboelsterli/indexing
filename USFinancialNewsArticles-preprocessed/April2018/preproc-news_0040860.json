    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The closing gap between short- and long-term interest rates is not pointing toward a recession, Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Randal Quarles said on Tuesday.\n“I’m not viewing the current flattening of the yield curve as much of a signal toward an impending recession,” Quarles told an event at the semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. “Obviously its something that we are looking at.”\nReporting by Jason Lange; Editing by Andrea Ricci\n ",
