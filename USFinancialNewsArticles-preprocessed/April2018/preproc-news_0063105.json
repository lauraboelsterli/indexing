    "text": "Larry Harvey, Burning Man festival co-founder, dies at 70 Published 16 Hours Ago The Associated Press Jim Urquhart | Reuters The Man dominates the playa during the Burning Man 2015 \"Carnival of Mirrors\" arts and music festival in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada, August 31, 2015.\nThe co-founder of the \"Burning Man\" festival has died. He was 70.\nBurning Man Project CEO Marian Goodell says Larry Harvey died Saturday morning at a hospital in San Francisco. The cause was not immediately known but he had suffered a stroke on April 4. Harvey created Burning Man on a San Francisco beach in 1986, later moving the annual event to Nevada's Black Rock Desert.\nAs many as 70,000 people from around the world now flock to a dry lakebed 100 miles (161 kilometers) east of Reno every August for what has become a weeklong celebration.\nDuring that week people are encouraged to build a community and pursue whatever interests them, while respecting one another.\nAt the celebration's conclusion a towering wooden effigy is burned to the ground.",
