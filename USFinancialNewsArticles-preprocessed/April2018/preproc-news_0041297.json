    "text": "82 COMMENTS HONG KONG—Chinese regulators warned they have “hard to resolve” concerns about Qualcomm Inc.’s QCOM -4.56% $44 billion bid for rival NXP Semiconductors NXPI -4.82% NV, the latest shot in a technology-centric trade battle with the U.S. that is growing more intense.\nThe move follows a decision by the U.S. Commerce Department to ban sales of American components to Chinese telecom giant ZTE Corp. ZTCOY -3.26% , as well as threats from the White House to slap tariffs on $150 billion worth of Chinese goods to punish what it says are efforts to steal U.S. technology .\nThe tit-for-tat steps have put technology firms at the center of an escalating trade fight between the U.S. and China, placing new constraints on the companies’ strategic plans and threatening their access to giant markets.\n“China wants very much to flex its muscles. It can certainly inflict pain on one large U.S. company, Qualcomm,” said Peter Fuhrman, chairman and chief executive officer of investment and advisory firm China First Capital. He said current tensions make this “the fraughtest moment in the 30-year history of U.S.-China technology trade and mutual reliance.”\nWashington has for years warned about China acquiring U.S. technology through unfair means, and protested that Beijing is walling off the world’s biggest internet market from American companies. Beijing has in turn vowed to defend its tech champions, fueling a multi-front battle that is catching many of world’s biggest tech companies in the crossfire. During a visit to China last month, Apple Inc. Chief Executive Tim Cook urged President Donald Trump to support free-trade policies .\n“Made in China 2025” is Beijing’s industrial plan to dominate high-tech industries including robotics, aerospace and computer chips. The Trump administration argues China is using the plan to give its tech companies unfair advantage over foreign rivals. But what is it exactly? Qualcomm’s supposed strategic value to the U.S. saved the company from a possible hostile $117 billion takeover last month by then Singapore-based Broadcom Ltd. Mr. Trump cited national-security concerns raised by China’s growing strength in advanced technologies such as fifth-generation wireless technology, known as 5G, that will usher in faster, more powerful connections.\nThe block put the mobile-chip giant firmly at the center of an escalating tech rivalry between its home country and its biggest market: China, which accounts for almost two-thirds of Qualcomm’s revenue.\nChina’s Commerce Ministry spokesman Gao Feng said Thursday a preliminary review of Qualcomm’s NXP deal turned up issues that make “it difficult to eliminate the negative impact,” but he didn’t close the door on an eventual approval.\nQualcomm on Thursday said it refiled its application with Chinese regulators, and agreed with NXP to extend the deal’s deadline by three months to July 25.\nQualcomm has been waiting for Beijing’s approval to proceed with the purchase of the Dutch company, having secured permission from the eight other major antitrust regulators around the world. The deal is seen as crucial to San Diego-based Qualcomm, which needs to look for growth beyond its dominance in the smartphone sector; NXP specializes in making chips for automobiles, a rapidly growing market.\nOn Wednesday, Qualcomm said it began laying off an unspecified number of employees to fulfill a promise to boost profit by shedding $1 billion in expenses. The layoffs are part of a cost-reduction program unveiled in January intended to persuade investors of the company’s prospects as it fended off Broadcom Ltd. , which was based in Singapore but has since redomiciled to the U.S. President Trump quashed Broadcom’s pursuit of Qualcomm, citing national-security concerns .\nMr. Gao also took aim at the seven-year U.S. ban on selling technology to ZTE—punishment for ZTE breaching an agreement reached last year to resolve alleged sanctions violations over the sale of gear to Iran. The ban is seen as potentially crippling for ZTE, which is one of two Chinese companies seeking to take a global lead in establishing next-generation mobile internet networks, known as 5G.\n“The action targets China,” Mr. Gao said. “However, it will ultimately undermine the U.S. itself.” He said the U.S. is risking “tens of thousands of jobs and shaking international confidence in the U.S. business environment.”\nThe interdependence of technology companies across the Pacific means that a tech war isn’t a zero-sum game; Qualcomm is one of several U.S. suppliers hurt by the ban on sales to ZTE. The ban potentially covers software like the Android operating system, developed by Google parent Alphabet Inc., which powers ZTE smartphones. ZTE is working to find ways to preserve its access to Android, according to a person familiar with the matter.\nA Google spokesman declined to comment Thursday. ZTE also declined to comment. It is delaying the release of its quarterly earnings report as it wrestles with the implications of the ban.\nU.S. punishment of a company seen as a national champion touched off rallying cries for support on Chinese social media, with photos of restaurants and stores displaying signs saying “We are all ZTE people” circulating.\nRelated\nChina: Qualcomm’s $44 Billion Purchase of NXP Has ‘Hard to Resolve’ Issues Qualcomm Cuts Jobs to Boost Profit U.S., Britain Issue Warnings Over Chinese Telecom Equipment Maker ZTE U.S. Wants to Retaliate Against China’s Restrictions on American Tech Firms Apple’s Cook to Trump: Embrace Open Trade Telecom ZTE Delays Earnings Report to Assess U.S. Penalty Action U.S. Says Huawei Is a Security Threat, So It’s Backing Off FCC Moves to Block Wireless Carriers From Using Subsidies to Buy Chinese Telecom Gear Hu Xijin, the editor of nationalistic tabloid Global Times who has a large social-media following, wrote in a post Wednesday that the ban was an attempt to edge China out in the race to dominate 5G technology.\n“Chinese society absolutely needs to support ZTE and back Huawei,” Mr. Hu wrote, referring to China’s other major telecoms gear maker.\nHuawei Technologies Co., the world’s largest provider of telecom equipment, acknowledged this week that after years of difficulties in the U.S., it is going to refocus on other markets .\nThe U.S. Federal Communications Commission approved a measure this week that would bar wireless carriers from using government subsidies to buy telecom gear from Chinese manufacturers . The U.S. Trade Representative’s office also said this week it is considering retaliation for China’s restrictions on U.S. providers of cloud computing and other services.\n“Everything here is about leverage and China understands its position in that respect very well,” said Mark Natkin, managing director of Marbridge Consulting Limited, a Beijing-based telecom, media and technology consulting company. “With tech companies playing an increasingly pivotal role in economic and geopolitical policy, it will be difficult for them not to be drawn into the tensions between the two countries.”\n—Lin Zhu and Josh Chin in Beijing, Natasha Khan in Hong Kong, Ted Greenwald in San Francisco, and Liza Lin in Shanghai contributed to this article.\nWrite to Yoko Kubota at yoko.kubota@wsj.com and Dan Strumpf at daniel.strumpf@wsj.com",
