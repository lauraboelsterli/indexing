    "text": "If you’ve stopped paying attention to the day-to-day changes, cyrptocurrencies are soaring once again.\nPrices for the major coins have shown substantial gains month-to-date in April as investors regain confidence in digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Ripple after big drops during the first quarter.\nBitcoin, the most expensive of the cryptocurrencies , has seen its value rise 32% so far this month, climbing from $6,978.63 to over $9,246 in mid-morning trading Friday, according to CoinMarketCap .\nEthereum, meanwhile, is up 69% in April and Ripple is showing a 66% increase.\nAnd the MVIS CryptoCompare Digital Assets 10 Index , a crypto market cap that tracks the performance of the 10-largest digital assets, shows a 68% overall increase in April.\nWhat’s behind the jump? That’s less clear, as it often is with crypto fluctuations. Some analysts say now that the “ tax selling pressure ” is behind investors, prices are certain to rise. (Bitcoin bull Tom Lee is predicting that crypto will hit $25,000 by year’s end, and John Pfeffer says it could hit as high as $700,000 .) And Ethereum has turned into an unlikely ally in China’s #MeToo movement , which could have helped it.\nThe increases are continuing today as well. All major cryptocurrencies are showing rises of 4% or more in mid-morning trading.",
