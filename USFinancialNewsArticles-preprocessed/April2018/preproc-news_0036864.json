    "text": " 10 AM / Updated 7 minutes ago Porsche AG CEO not targeted in German emissions probe - sources Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - Porsche AG’s ( VOWG_p.DE ) Chief Executive Oliver Blume is not the board member targeted by Stuttgart prosecutors probing an emissions cheating scandal, two sources familiar with the talks said on Wednesday. The logo of German carmaker Porsche AG is seen before the company's annual news conference in Stuttgart, Germany, March 17, 2017. REUTERS/Lukas Barth \nPorsche and the Stuttgart prosecutor’s office declined to comment on which board member has been included in a criminal probe. \nGerman prosecutors said they are investigating current and former employees of Volkswagen-owned sports car maker Porsche, including a management board member, as part of their inquiries into emissions manipulations.
