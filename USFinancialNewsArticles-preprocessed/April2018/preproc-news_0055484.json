    "text": "GLEN BURNIE, Md., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glen Burnie Bancorp (“Bancorp”) (NASDAQ:GLBZ), the bank holding company for The Bank of Glen Burnie (“Bank”), announced today net income of $0.26 million, or $0.09 per basic and diluted common share for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, as compared to net income of $0.32 million, or $0.10 per basic and diluted common share for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017.\nFor the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, net loans grew by $5.7 million, or 2.1%, as compared to March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, Bancorp had total assets of $390.4 million. Bancorp, the oldest independent commercial bank in Anne Arundel County, will pay its 103 rd consecutive quarterly dividend on May 4, 2018.\n\"By continuing our fiscal 2017 transformative accomplishments into the first quarter of 2018, we are confident that our momentum will drive our results for the remainder of 2018 and beyond,” said John D. Long, President and CEO. “Technology advancements that support our loan origination team contributed to a strong organic loan growth rate of 2.1% when compared to the same period in 2017. We continued to make investments in technology systems during the first quarter that allow us to remain competitive in the rapidly changing technological environment. These improvements allow the Company to remain vigilant in its risk mitigation efforts, and to continue providing a high level of service to our valued customers. Net interest income continued to rise during the first quarter, driving a consistent core earnings expansion. Net interest income grew by $160,000 or 5.7%, this quarter compared to the first quarter of last year, as the yield on our loan portfolio grew from 4.21% to 4.25%, and our funding costs declined by $39,000 or 7.9%, from $491,000 to $452,000. The overall credit environment remained favorable, although a single impaired loan led management to increase the allowance for loan losses to 1.05% of total loans from 0.96% at December 31, 2017. Headquartered in the dynamic Northern Anne Arundel County market, we believe the Bank is well-positioned with sound growth, asset quality and capital levels, a widening net interest margin, and an experienced and seasoned executive team. We remain deeply committed to serving the financial needs of the community through the development of new loan and deposit products.”\nHighlights for the First Three Months of 2018\nBancorp continued to grow organically in the first quarter of 2018 driven primarily by favorable net loan growth and supported by an improving 0.51% cost of funds, as compared to 0.56% for the same period in 2017. Bancorp has strong liquidity and capital positions that provide ample capacity for future growth, along with the Bank’s total regulatory capital to risk weighted assets of 13.85% at March 31, 2018.\nReturn on average assets for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 was 0.26%, as compared to 0.33% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. Return on average equity for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 was 3.06%, as compared to 3.79% for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017.\nThe book value per share of Bancorp’s common stock was $11.83 at March 31, 2018, as compared to $12.16 per share at March 31, 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, the Bank remained above all “well-capitalized” regulatory requirement levels. The Bank’s tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was approximately 12.73% at March 31, 2018, as compared to 13.14% at March 31, 2017. Liquidity remained strong due to managed cash and cash equivalents, borrowing lines with the FHLB of Atlanta, the Federal Reserve and correspondent banks, and the size and composition of the bond portfolio.\nBalance Sheet Review\nTotal assets were $390.4 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of 1.31% from $395.5 million at March 31, 2017. Investment securities were $90.3 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of 0.84% from $91.1 million at March 31, 2017. Total loans were $275.7 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of 2.22% from $269.7 million at March 31, 2017.\nTotal deposits were $336.2 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of 1.29% from $340.6 million at March 31, 2017. Non-interest bearing deposits were $107.1 million at March 31, 2018, an increase of 1.80% from $105.2 million at March 31, 2017. Total borrowings were $20.0 million at March 31, 2018, unchanged from $20.0 million at March 31, 2017.\nStockholders’ equity was $33.2 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $0.7 million from $33.9 million at March 31, 2017. The decrease in the first quarter 2018 was related to lower corporate earnings and a decrease in other comprehensive income associated with the available for sale bond portfolio.\nNonperforming assets, which consist of nonaccrual loans, troubled debt restructurings, accruing loans past due 90 days or more, and other real estate owned, represented 1.49% of total assets at March 31, 2018, as compared to 1.05% for the same period of 2017.\nReview of Financial Results\nFor the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\nNet income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 was $0.26 million, as compared to net income of $0.32 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017.\nNet interest income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 totaled $3.0 million, as compared to $2.8 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. Average earning loans and investment securities increased to $366 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2018, as compared to $362 million for the same period of 2017.\nNet interest margin for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 was 3.22%, as compared to 3.07% for the same period of 2017. Lower funding costs were the primary driver of year-over-year results, as the cost of funds decreased 0.05% from 0.56% to 0.51% for the three month periods ending March 31, 2017 and 2018, respectively.\nThe provision for loan losses for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 was $0.36 million, as compared to $0.20 million for the same period of 2017. The increase for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 was primarily the result of deteriorated credit quality of a single participated loan and is not indicative of poor credit quality of the overall loan portfolio. As a result, the allowance for loan losses was $2.9 million at March 31, 2018, representing 1.05% of total loans, as compared to $2.6 million, or 0.96% of total loans for the same period of 2017.\nNoninterest income for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 was $0.49 million, as compared to $0.30 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. The results for the first quarter of 2018 include a $0.21 million gain on redemption of BOLI policy.\nFor the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, noninterest expense was $2.83 million, as compared to $2.57 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. The primary contributors to the $0.26 million increase, when compared to the three-month period ended March 31, 2017 were increases in salary and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses, legal, accounting and other professional fees and loan collection costs and telephone costs, partially offset by decreases in data processing and item processing services and advertising and marketing related expenses.\nGlen Burnie Bancorp Information\nGlen Burnie Bancorp is a bank holding company headquartered in Glen Burnie, Maryland.
