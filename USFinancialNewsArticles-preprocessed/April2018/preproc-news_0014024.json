    "text": "VALENCIA, Venezuela (Reuters) - Venezuela on Monday reopened air and sea links to the islands of Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao, three months after cutting them off in an attempt to curb smuggling.\nThe move is a welcome relief to those in Venezuela who can afford to fly out, after Copa, one of the last major airlines still operating in the OPEC nation, was forced by authorities to suspend services last week.\nThe majority of international airlines have pulled out of the crisis-hit country over the last few years, citing economic and security concerns.\nAn Aruba Airlines plane took off from Valencia airport, some 150 km (93 miles) from Caracas, on Monday morning on its way to the Aruban capital of Oranjestad.\nTransport Minister Carlos Osorio announced the reopening of links from the runway.\nPanamaâ€™s Copa, a major regional carrier, was included in a list of companies with which the Venezuelan government broke economic relations last week.\nVenezuelan authorities cited alleged money laundering by Panamanian officials and companies, prompting both countries to recall their ambassadors.\nReporting by Tibisay Romero; Writing by Girish Gupta; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe\n ",
