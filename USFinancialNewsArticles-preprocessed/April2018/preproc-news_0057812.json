    "text": "FRANKFURT, April 27 (Reuters) - Daimler expects currency headwinds from the strong euro to cause a hit to earnings in excess of 1 billion euros ($1.21 billion) this year.\nThe euroâ€™s strength against the renminbi, Turkish lira, British pound, and yen will hit results, Chief Financial Officer Bodo Uebber said in a call with journalists on Friday.\nSeparately, Daimler said the falling value of diesel vehicles had caused the carmaker to revise the value of its leasing portfolio downward by 100 million euros. ($1 = 0.8270 euros) (Reporting by Edward Taylor Editing by Maria Sheahan)\n ",
