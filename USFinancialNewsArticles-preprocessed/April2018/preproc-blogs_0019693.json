    "text": "UPDATE 1-China agriculture ministry to closely watch soybean supplies after tariff plan Dominique Patton \n* Agmin sees no impact from soybean tariffs in near-term \n* Still watching impact on rest of year supplies \n* Expects healthy demand at corn auctions (Adds details) \nBEIJING, April 10 (Reuters) - China's agriculture ministry said on Tuesday it expects soybean supplies to be \"basically normal\" in the short-term after Beijing proposed a 25 percent tariff on U.S. imports, but will monitor the impact for the rest of the year. \nIn its first official comment on the issue, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs noted in its monthly crop report that South America is the main supplier to China during the first part of the year. \nHowever, \"further developments and the impact on supply and demand for the whole year must continue to be monitored,\" it added, in an acknowledgement of the planned 25 percent tariff on soybeans from the United States, China's No. 2 supplier. \nThe proposed tariffs are in retaliation for recent aggressive U.S. trade actions amid an escalating trade dispute between the world's top two economies. \nChina imports about $40 billion of soybeans a year, which are crushed to make meal for use in animal food and oil for cooking. About a third of its imports come from the United States. \nChina's soymeal futures jumped nearly 6 percent to record highs on Monday following news of Beijing's planned tariffs, with other key proteins also soaring on the news. \nBut without a timeframe for the tariffs, and proposed talks between the U.S. and China now on the table, there is still a great deal of uncertainty in the market, say analysts. \nThe ministry did not change its forecast for soybean imports in the 2017/18 crop year, and has not yet issued an outlook for the following year. \nIt also said state corn sales to begin this week would curb rising prices of the grain in the near-term but the impact would be limited, with demand from processors expected to be healthy. \nThe report also lowered the forecast for sugar output in 2017/18 by 50,000 tonnes to 10.25 million tonnes, largely due to a decline in yields in major growing region Guangxi.
