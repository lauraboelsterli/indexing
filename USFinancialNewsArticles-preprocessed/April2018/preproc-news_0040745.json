    "text": "BISHKEK (Reuters) - Kyrgyzstan’s parliament named Mukhammedkaliy Abylgaziyev prime minister on Friday after his nomination by the Social Democratic party which leads the ruling coalition.\nNewly appointed Kyrgyz Prime Minister Mukhammedkaliy Abylgaziyev addresses lawmakers during a parliament session in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan April 20, 2018. REUTERS/Vladimir Pirogov Abylgaziyev, previously chief of staff in President Sooronbai Jeenbekov’s office, replaced Sapar Isakov whose cabinet lost a no-confidence vote this week.\nThe government reshuffle completes a series of moves taken by Jeenbekov since he came to power last November to remove the appointees of his predecessor, Almazbek Atambayev, from key positions in the Central Asian nation of six million.\nVolatility has plagued Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet republic hosting a Russian military air base, since it gained independence in 1991. Political conflicts erupted into violent revolutions in 2005 and 2010.\nReporting by Olga Dzyubenko; Writing by Olzhas Auyezov; Editing by Peter Graff\n ",
