Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500 provides a ranking of the fastest growing technology, media, telecommunications, life sciences and energy tech companies – both public and private – in North America. Technology Fast 500 award winners are selected based on percentage fiscal year revenue growth from 2014 to 2016. Snipp grew 1189% percent during this period.\n“We are extremely pleased with our Q4 and Full year 2017 results. The company has come a long way from the days of having only one technical solution - our industry leading receipt processing engine, to today; where we can now compete across multiple industries through robust solutions like our Loyalty and Rebates platforms,” commented Atul Sabharwal, CEO and Founder of Snipp. “We look forward to 2018 as we focus on reaching consistent profitability and taking advantage of strategic opportunities in both new and existing markets. Repeat business from our current clients is picking up, but new industries such as Hospitality and Cannabis will provide further avenues of growth well into the future. The tremendous success of our recently announced Cannabis Marketing Resource Center gives us an added level of confidence in 2018. This is familiar ground for us, similar to other regulated industries where we already have an established position. So our timing is perfect in educating and engaging with many of the industry leaders prior to the revenue ramp that will begin in the Cannabis industry later this year.”\nSnipp has also posted an updated investor presentation on its website at the following URL http://www.snipp.com/presentations/\nNon-GAAP Measures\nSnipp uses certain performance measures throughout this document that are not recognizable under Canadian generally accepted accounting principles or IFRS (\"GAAP\"). These performance measures include Gross Margin and EBITDA. Management believes that these measures provide supplemental financial information that is useful in the evaluation of the Company's operations.\nInvestors should be cautioned, however, that these measures should not be construed as alternatives to measures determined in accordance with GAAP and IFRS as an indicator of Snipp's performance. The Company's method of calculating these measures may differ from that of other organizations, and accordingly, these may not be comparable.\nEBITDA\nSnipp defines earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) as revenue minus operating expenses excluding non-cash operating expenses of stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization (interest and taxes are not included in the Company’s operating expenses).\nGross Margin\nSnipp defines Gross Margin as revenue less campaign infrastructure. The Company's calculation of Gross Margin is not a financial measure that is recognized under GAAP. Investors should be cautioned that the Company's defined Gross Margin should not be construed as an alternative measure to other measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\nBookings Backlog\nSnipp defines Bookings Backlog as future revenue from existing customer contracts to be recognized in future quarters in the current fiscal year and the next fiscal year. Bookings get translated into revenues based on IFRS principles and the Bookings Backlog reflects how revenues in future quarters in the current fiscal year and next fiscal year are steadily being booked today.\nFor More Information\nCONFERENCE CALL DETAILS:\nIn conjunction with this announcement, Snipp management will host a conference call and live webcast for analysts and investors on Tuesday, April 3, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the Company’s financial results.\nTo listen to the live conference call, parties in the United States and Canada should dial 800-281-7973, access code 6384966.
