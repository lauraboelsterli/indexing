    "text": "DES MOINES, Iowa, April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\n2018 First Quarter Summary Financial Results\nNet income totaled $118 million, a decrease of $22 million from the same period last year. Net interest income totaled $157 million, an increase of $4 million from the same period last year.

Capital totaled $7.4 billion, an increase of $0.4 billion. Retained earnings totaled $1.9 billion, an increase $0.1 billion. Regulatory capital ratio increased to 5.11 percent from 5.03 percent.\nStrong Bank. Strong Communities.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nAdvances of $108.3 billion were outstanding to 738 members, housing associates, and former members, of which 65 percent were held by the Bank’s five largest borrowers. Mortgage loans of $242 million were purchased from 130 members. Mortgage loans of $228 million were delivered by members through the MPF Xtra, MPF Direct, and MPF Government MBS programs. Paid $57 million of cash dividends at an annualized combined rate of 4.03 percent during the first quarter. Accrued $14 million for use in the Bank’s Affordable Housing Program (AHP).\n“We were very pleased with the Bank’s financial performance in the first quarter of 2018,” said Michael L. Wilson, President and CEO. “With more than 77 percent of our assets in advances and mortgages, we are performing well with a moderate risk profile.”\nMichael L. Wilson\nPresident and CEO\nFinancial Results Discussion\nNet Income - For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Bank recorded net income of $118 million compared to $140 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to net gains on litigation settlements of $21 million recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2017. The Bank did not record any gains on litigation settlements during the first quarter of 2018. The Bank’s net income was also impacted by net interest income, other income (loss), and other expense.\nNet Interest Income - The Bank’s net interest income totaled $157 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $153 million for the same period last year. The Bank’s net interest margin was 0.42 percent during the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to 0.35 percent for the same period in 2017. The increase in net interest margin was primarily driven by the higher interest rate environment.\nOther Income (Loss) - The Bank recorded net gains of $8 million in other income (loss) for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to net gains of $35 million for the same period last year. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, other income (loss) was primarily impacted by net gains on litigation settlements of $21 million as a result of settlements with certain defendants in the Bank’s private-label MBS litigation. The Bank did not record any litigation settlements during the three months ended March 31, 2018. Other factors impacting other income (loss) included net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities and net gains (losses) on trading securities, as described below.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Bank recorded net gains of $20 million on its derivatives and hedging activities through other income (loss) compared to net gains of $6 million during the same period last year. The fair value changes were primarily driven by changes in interest rates. These changes impacted the Bank’s fair value hedge relationships and fair value changes on interest rate swaps that the Bank utilized to economically hedge its investment securities portfolio.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Bank recorded net losses on trading securities of $16 million compared to net gains of $5 million for the same period in 2017. These changes in fair value were primarily due to the impact of changes in interest rates and credit spreads on the Bank’s fixed rate trading securities.\nOther Expense - Other expense totaled $33 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $32 million for the same period last year. The increase was driven primarily by compensation and benefits, partially offset by a decline in professional fees.\nAssets - The Bank’s total assets increased to $149.3 billion at March 31, 2018, from $145.1 billion at December 31, 2017, driven by an increase in advances. Advances at March 31, 2018 increased by $5.6 billion from advances at December 31, 2017 due primarily to borrowings by a large depository institution member. The increase in borrowings was partially offset by a decrease in advances across certain other institution types.\nLiabilities - The Bank’s total liabilities increased to $141.9 billion at March 31, 2018, from $138.1 billion at December 31, 2017, driven primarily by an increase in the amount of consolidated obligations needed to fund the Bank’s assets.\nCapital - Total capital increased to $7.4 billion at March 31, 2018 from $7.0 billion at December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in activity-based capital stock resulting from an increase in advance balances. In addition, retained earnings increased due to net income, partially offset by dividends paid. The Bank’s regulatory capital ratio increased to 5.11 percent at March 31, 2018, from 5.03 percent at December 31, 2017 and was above the required regulatory minimum at each period end. Regulatory capital includes all capital stock, mandatorily redeemable capital stock, and retained earnings, and the regulatory capital ratio compares this to period-end total assets.\nAdditional financial information will be provided in the Bank’s First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q available at www.fhlbdm.com or www.sec.gov on or before May 15, 2018.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines\nFinancial Highlights\n(preliminary and unaudited) March 31, December 31, Statements of Condition (dollars in millions) 2018 2017 Cash and due from banks $ 194 $ 503 Investments 33,370 34,452 Advances 108,253 102,613 Mortgage loans held for portfolio, net 7,112 7,096 Total assets 149,347 145,099 Consolidated obligations 140,134 135,575 Mandatorily redeemable capital stock 356 385 Total liabilities 141,912 138,078 Capital stock - Class B putable 5,372 5,068 Retained earnings 1,904 1,839 Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 159 114 Total capital 7,435 7,021 Total regulatory capital 1 7,632 7,292 Regulatory capital ratio 5.11 % 5.03 % 1 Total regulatory capital includes all capital stock, mandatorily redeemable capital stock, and retained earnings.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines\nFinancial Highlights (continued from previous page)\n(preliminary and unaudited) For the Three Months Ended March 31, Operating Results (dollars in millions) 2018 2017 Net interest income $ 157 $ 153 Other income (loss): Net gains (losses) on trading securities (16 ) 5 Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities 20 6 Gains on litigation settlements, net — 21 Other, net 4 3 Total other income (loss) 8 35 Total other expense 33 32 Net income before assessments 132 156 Affordable Housing Program assessments 14 16 Net income $ 118 $ 140 Performance Ratios Net interest spread 0.35 % 0.31 % Net interest margin 0.42 0.35 Return on average equity 6.56 7.52 Return on average capital stock 9.05 9.49 Return on average assets 0.32 0.31 The selected financial data above should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in the Bank’s First Quarter 2018 Form 10-Q expected to be filed on or about May 15, 2018 with the SEC.\nStatements contained in this announcement, including statements describing the objectives, projections, estimates, or future predictions in the Bank’s operations, may be forward-looking statements.
