    "text": "ZUERICH/FRANKFURT, April 3 (Reuters) - Two major Deutsche Bank investors on Tuesday criticized chairman Paul Achleitner over the lender’s performance and his handling of a search for a new chief executive.\nConfidence in Achleitner has been damaged, said a major shareholder. “He makes too many excuses for strategic mistakes that fall under his responsibility,” the person said on condition of anonymity.\nAnother major investor said, “The situation is a bit odd. Achleitner is obviously not controlling the process. All is a bit chaotic at the moment.”\nBoth Chief Executive John Cryan and Achleitner have been criticised for Deutsche Bank’s share price and earnings.\nHowever Achleitner, rather than Cryan, should take the fall, said the second shareholder, who also declined to be named.\nA spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment on Achleitner’s behalf.
