    "text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Magellan Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: MGLN) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, as summarized below:\nThree Months Ended March 31, (In millions, except per share results) 2018\n2017\nChg\nNet revenue $ 1,805.1 $ 1,305.6 38.3% Net income $ 11.5 $ 17.7 -35.5% Segment profit [1] $ 55.6 $ 69.8 -20.4% Adjusted net income [1] $ 20.8 $ 26.1 -20.4% Per share results: Earnings per share $ 0.45 $ 0.74 -39.2% Adjusted earnings per share [1] $ 0.81 $ 1.09 -25.7% [1] Refer to the Basis of Presentation for a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures. Highlights Include:\nNet revenue increased 38.3 percent over 2017 to $1.8 billion. Net income decreased 35.5 percent over 2017 to $11.5 million. Segment profit decreased 20.4 percent over 2017 to $55.6 million. Adjusted net income decreased 20.4 percent from 2017 to $20.8 million. Unrestricted cash and investments were $288.3 million as of March 31, 2018. Approximately $91.5 million of the unrestricted cash and investments as of March 31, 2018, is related to excess capital and undistributed earnings held at regulated entities. The Company is lowering its full year 2018 earnings guidance. On March 12, 2018, the Company entered into a contract with the State of Arizona as one of seven integrated managed care organizations that will coordinate physical and behavioral health services for approximately one million Medicaid eligible members in the central geographic service area effective October 1, 2018. On April 16, 2018, the Company entered into a contract with the Commonwealth of Virginia to participate statewide in the Medallion 4 program. The Company was selected through a competitive procurement and is one of six health plans to contract with Virginia for this program. The Medallion program will collectively serve over 700,000 TANF Medicaid enrollees. On April 24, 2018, the Company was notified by the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) that the Company was not selected to negotiate a new contract to serve as a vendor for its Medicaid managed care program for plans beginning January 1, 2019. The Company plans to file a protest with AHCA.\n“We are disappointed by the news in Florida and will be filing a protest with AHCA within the next two weeks,” said Barry M. Smith, chairman and chief executive officer of Magellan Health. “The government business is unique and requires a high level of customer understanding and deep domain expertise. While the environment can be challenging in the short term, we are comfortable with this dynamic and remain confident in the strength of our capabilities to manage high-cost, complex populations. We believe these capabilities will continue to resonate in the market and provide continued growth.”\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $1.8 billion, an increase of 38.3 percent over the same period in 2017. This increase was mainly due to net business growth and the revenue from the Senior Whole Health acquisition that closed in October 2017.\nSegment Profit\nSegment profit was $55.6 million for the first quarter, compared to $69.8 million in the prior year quarter.\nHealthcare segment profit was $45.9 million, which represents a decrease of 2.9 percent over 2017. The decrease was mainly due to the higher favorable out of period items in the prior year’s quarter, the October 2017 capitation rate decrease in Florida, and operating losses in Virginia, partially offset by the earnings contribution from Senior Whole Health. The current quarter’s results included $5 million of favorable out of period items compared to approximately $13 million of favorable items in the prior year. Pharmacy management segment profit was $15.5 million, which was a decrease of 46.5 percent from 2017. This year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the new ASC 606 revenue recognition standards related to Part D as well as the timing of network management initiatives. These items are considered to be timing differences that will reverse over the balance of the year. Corporate costs, inclusive of eliminations but excluding stock compensation expense, totaled $5.8 million, which was comparable to 2017.\nCash Flow & Balance Sheet\nCash flow from operations for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $81.0 million versus a use of cash of $31.1 million in 2017. The improved cash flow in the current year quarter is primarily the result of favorable timing of working capital.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company’s unrestricted cash and investments totaled $288.3 million, which represents an increase of $27.2 million from the balance at December 31, 2017. Approximately $91.5 million of the unrestricted cash and investments at March 31, 2018, is related to excess capital and undistributed earnings held at regulated entities.\nRestricted cash and investments at March 31, 2018, of $456.5 million reflects a decrease of $8.9 million from the balance at December 31, 2017.\nOutlook\nThe Company is lowering its 2018 full year earnings guidance.\n“We are lowering our earnings guidance ranges primarily as a result of both the slower pace of progress on initiatives to achieve profitability in Virginia as well as estimates for investments and startup losses for our new Medicaid contract in Arizona and other emerging MCC market opportunities,” said Jonathan N. Rubin, chief financial officer of Magellan Health. “We will be focused on execution over the balance of the year. I believe the fundamentals of our business remain strong and am confident in our long term growth strategy.”\nThe Company now anticipates segment profit in the range of $365 million to $385 million. In addition, the Company expects net income in the range of $113 million to $137 million, adjusted net income in the range of $151 million to $171 million, EPS in the range of $4.41 to $5.35 and adjusted EPS in the range of $5.90 to $6.68. The Company is maintaining its revenue guidance at the current level of $7.5 to $7.8 billion.\n“Compared to 2018, we expect the segment profit run rate to increase for the remainder of the year due to the following three factors: margin expansion due to initiatives in our healthcare segment; new business and same store growth; and normal earnings seasonality in our pharmacy business,” said Rubin.\n2018 Guidance April 26, 2018 February 27, 2018 Low\nHigh\nLow\nHigh\nNet revenue $ 7,500.0 $ 7,800.0 $ 7,500.0 $ 7,800.0 Income before income taxes $ 165.0 $ 203.0 $ 186.0 $ 224.0 Net income $ 113.0 $ 137.0 $ 125.0 $ 149.0 Segment Profit [1] $ 365.0 $ 385.0 $ 390.0 $ 410.0 Adjusted net income [1] $ 151.0 $ 171.0 $ 163.0 $ 183.0 Per share results: Earnings per share [2] $ 4.41 $ 5.35 $ 4.88 $ 5.82 Adjusted earnings per share [1][2] $ 5.90 $ 6.68 $ 6.37 $ 7.15 [1] Refer to the Basis of Presentation for a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures. [2] 2018 EPS and Adjusted EPS guidance includes share repurchases and option exercises through the close of business April 20, 2018, but excludes the impact of any potential future activity.

Following is a description of these important non-GAAP measures.\nSegment profit is equal to net revenues less the sum of cost of care, cost of goods sold, direct service costs and other operating expenses, and includes income from unconsolidated subsidiaries, but excludes segment profit or loss from non-controlling interests held by other parties, stock compensation expense, special charges or benefits, as well as changes in the fair value of contingent consideration recorded in relation to acquisitions.\nAdjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share reflect certain adjustments made for acquisitions completed after January 1, 2013, to exclude non-cash stock compensation expense resulting from restricted stock purchases by sellers, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, amortization of identified acquisition intangibles, as well as impairment of identified acquisition intangibles.\nIncluded in the tables issued with this press release are the reconciliations from GAAP measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures.\nAbout Magellan Health\nMagellan Health, Inc. is a leader in managing the fastest growing, most complex areas of health, including special populations, complete pharmacy benefits and other specialty areas of healthcare.
