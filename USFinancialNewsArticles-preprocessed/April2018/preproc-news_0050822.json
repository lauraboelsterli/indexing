    "text": "0 COMMENTS The U.S. dollar edged lower Tuesday, as investors locked in gains on a recent rally in the U.S. currency.\nThe WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the currency against a basket of 16 others, fell 0.1% to 84.87.\nRising U.S. yields and the prospect of a more aggressive Federal Reserve have boosted the dollar in recent days, interrupting the currency’s monthslong decline. Expectations of higher interest rates make the dollar more attractive to investors seeking yield. Long-term Treasury yields topped 3% for the first time since 2014 on Tuesday, a sign of confidence in U.S. economic growth.\nDespite Tuesday’s drop in the dollar, “the stars are aligning for a bear-market correction over the coming weeks,” Mark McCormick, an analyst at TD Securities said in a note to clients. The dollar’s recent gains have been aided by investors’ perceptions that world-wide economic growth is starting to soften and that central banks from Canada to China are seeking opportunities to increase monetary support for their economies, he said.\nInvestors will be watching the European Central Bank’s monetary-policy meeting later this week to gauge whether officials are growing more confident regarding the pace of European growth.\nMore dollar gains could force investors who had bet on continued dollar declines to reverse their wagers and buy back the U.S. currency. That could push the U.S. dollar even higher, analysts said.\nNet bets against the dollar in futures markets stood at their highest level since 2011 earlier this month, data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed.\n“Dollar bears are still likely to get shaken this week,” analysts at Société Générale said in a report. The firm expects the euro to hit $1.30 against the dollar this year, and recommends clients use the single currency’s recent weakness as a buying opportunity.\nThe euro gained 0.2% to $1.2233. The dollar rose 0.1% against the Japanese yen to ¥108.81. The British pound added 0.3% to $1.3978.\nWrite to Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com and Daniel Kruger at Daniel.Kruger@wsj.com",
