    "text": "April 18, 2018 / 3:29 AM / Updated 18 minutes ago Trump says on Twitter he does not like TPP for U.S., too many contingencies Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - President Donald Trump said again on Twitter on Tuesday that he does not like the landmark Trans-Pacific Partnership deal for the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump awaits the arrival of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida U.S. April 17, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque \n“While Japan and South Korea would like us to go back into TPP, I don’t like the deal for the United States,” he tweeted. \n“Too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn’t work. Bilateral deals are far more efficient, profitable and better for OUR workers. Look how bad WTO is to U.S.” Reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee; Editing by Tom Hogue",
