FILE PHOTO: Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn gives an interview on FOX Business Network's Neil Cavuto show in New York February 11, 2014. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo \nIcahn's stake is said to be below the 5 percent limit that warrants public disclosure, CNBC said, mentioning that a particular agenda for anything specific from VMware or Dell is unclear. cnb.cx/2qFIHbD \nComputer maker Dell, which owns 80 percent of VMWare, said in February it was exploring a public offering or a combination with VMware. \nIn 2013, Icahn had unsuccessfully attempted to block Michael Dell’s $25 billion (£17.4 billion) offer to take Dell Inc private. \nVMware declined to comment on the report. Carl Icahn or his representatives were not immediately available to comment outside of regular U.S. business hours. Reporting by Shalini Nagarajan in Bengaluru; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier",
