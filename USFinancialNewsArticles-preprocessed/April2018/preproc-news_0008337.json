    "text": "PETALUMA, Calif., April 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sonoma Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: SNOA, warrants SNOAW), a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops and markets unique and effective solutions for management of dermatological conditions and advanced tissue care, today announced it has received a new 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an antimicrobial post-therapy gel. Under the supervision of a healthcare professional, the new product is intended for the management of post-non-ablative laser therapy procedures and post-microdermabrasion therapy as well for use following superficial chemical peels. It may also be used to relieve itch and pain from minor skin irritations, lacerations, abrasions and minor burns.\nDr. Michael Gold, board-certified dermatologist and cosmetic surgeon, and founder of Gold Skin Care Center, Advanced Aesthetics Medical Spa, The Laser & Rejuvenation Center, and Tennessee Clinical Research Center, all located in Nashville, Tennessee, commented, “This antimicrobial post-treatment gel is a promising new tool for all dermatologists and aesthetic clinicians who are looking to better manage medical procedures, post-procedure itch and pain associated with procedures including laser skin resurfacing, while promoting enhanced healing and protection against secondary infections. In our clinical testing to date, we have seen dramatically improved outcomes with quicker healing times and less patient discomfort when this advanced technology is added to our procedure management protocol.”\n\"This approval is one in a series that further fortifies Sonoma’s portfolio of innovative antimicrobial dermatology products,” said Jim Schutz, Sonoma Pharmaceutical's CEO. “With our continuing efforts working with the FDA to provide best-in-class products as alternatives to topical steroids and topical antibiotics, dermatologists should have increased confidence in our growing product portfolio without concern for the troubling side effects found in dated treatments.”\nFor more information, visit IntraDerm Pharmaceuticals at www.intraderm.com or phone 1-855-317-1107.\nAbout Laser Skin Resurfacing\nAccording to the Clinical, Cosmetic and Investigational Dermatology Journal , medical and aesthetic skin procedures have seen a steady surge within the last decade, and a higher demand for skin rejuvenation practices. In 2013 in the United States, dermatologic surgeons performed over 9.5 million treatments, an almost 22% increase from the previous year, with a rising number of treatments involving skin resurfacing in the areas of laser/light/energy-based procedures (2.25 million), chemical peels (1.1 million), and microdermabrasion (974,000).\nLaser skin resurfacing, also known as a laser peel, laser vaporization and lasabrasion, can reduce facial wrinkles, scars and blemishes. Newer laser technologies provide surgeons with a new level of control in laser surfacing, permitting extreme precision, especially in delicate areas. The laser beam used in laser resurfacing will remove outer layer of skin, called the epidermis. It simultaneously heats the underlying skin, called the dermis. This action works to stimulate growth of new collagen fibers. As the treated area heals, the new skin that forms is smoother and firmer. Common side effects include redness of the skin, swelling of the treated area, itch, pain and moderate irritation similar to the feeling produced by a mild sunburn.\nAbout Sonoma Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nSonoma is a specialty pharmaceutical company that develops and markets unique and effective solutions for management of dermatological conditions and advanced tissue care.
