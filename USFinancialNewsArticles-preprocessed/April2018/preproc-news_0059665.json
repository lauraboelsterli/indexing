    "text": "Reblog Snap Inc. is trying a reboot with its video-recording sunglasses, Spectacles, which had a splashy debut—and then fizzled—when introduced just over 18 months ago. The move shows the company is sticking with its push into hardware as it tries to diversify beyond its roots in social media. On Thursday, Snap started selling the updated version of Spectacles on its website for $150.",
