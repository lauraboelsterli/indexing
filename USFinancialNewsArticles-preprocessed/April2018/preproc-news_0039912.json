    "text": "April 13, 2018 / 7:13 AM / Updated 20 minutes ago Singapore watchdog sets interim terms for Uber-Grab deal Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nSINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore’s competition watchdog on Friday outlined a number of interim measures as it continued investigation into ride-hailing firm Grab’s decision to buy Uber Technologies’ business in the city-state. FILE PHOTO: A view of Uber and Grab offices in Singapore March 26, 2018. REUTERS/Edgar Su/File Photo \nThe Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore said the measures include preventing Grab to take over operational data from Uber to enhance its market position, adding that Uber would continue to operate in Singapore until May 7 to smoothen the transition. \nOther measures include ensuring that drivers are not subjected to ‘exclusivity agreements’ and making sure the ride-hailing firms maintain their pre-merger pricing and commission levels. \nUber is selling its Southeast Asian business to bigger local rival Grab, marking the U.S. company’s second retreat from an Asian market. The deal, however, is under regulatory scrutiny. Reporting by John Geddie, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips",
