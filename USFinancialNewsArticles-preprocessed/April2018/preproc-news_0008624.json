    "text": "General Electric said on Wednesday that it planned to provide restated results for 2016 and 2017 to reflect a new accounting standard by April 13.\nThe updated accounting standard takes into account revenue from long-term contracts, which are being scrutinized by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\nGE had said in February that it expected to take a $4.2 billion accounting charge as it switches to the new standard.\nThe company also said it would report its first-quarter earnings on April 20 under the new standard and that it would have no impact on its 2018 forecast.",
