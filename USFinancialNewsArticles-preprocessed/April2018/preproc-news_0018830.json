We discuss many of these risks in greater detail under the heading “Risk Factors” in the quarterly and annual reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In particular, FDA approval of Rhopressa ® does not constitute FDA approval of Roclatan TM , and there can be no assurance that we will receive FDA approval for Roclatan TM or any future product candidates. FDA approval of Rhopressa ® also does not constitute regulatory approval of Rhopressa ® in jurisdictions outside the United States, and there can be no assurance that Rhopressa ® will obtain regulatory approval in other jurisdictions. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and the development of the industry in which we operate may differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this press release.
