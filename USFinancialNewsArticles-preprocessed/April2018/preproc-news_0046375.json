Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi speaks during his news conference with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at the Diaoyutai State Guest House in Beijing, China, April 23, 2018. Madoka Ikegami/Pool via REUTERS \n“We are against revising these agreements, we consider it very counter productive to try to reduce to zero years of international work carried out via talks between the six major powers and Iran,” TASS quoted Lavrov as saying after talks with Wang Yi, China’s top diplomat, in Beijing. \n“We will obstruct attempts to sabotage these agreements which were enshrined in a U.N. Security Council resolution,” Lavrov was cited as saying. Reporting by Maria Kiselyova; Writing by Polina Nikolskaya; Editing by Andrew Osborn",
