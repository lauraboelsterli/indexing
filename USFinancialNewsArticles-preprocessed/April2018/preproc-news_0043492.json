Apr 22, 2018; San Antonio, TX, USA; Andrew Landry celebrates with the trophy after the final round of the Valero Texas Open golf tournament at TPC San Antonio - AT&T Oaks Course. Mandatory Credit: Soobum Im-USA TODAY Sports \nTexas-born Landry, who lives in nearby Austin, birdied the first three holes after starting the day tied for the lead with fellow American Zach Johnson. \nIn his 32nd start on tour, Landry parred the final seven holes to finish at 17-under 271 at TPC San Antonio while Trey Mullinax and Sean O’Hair tied for second on 15 under. Slideshow (5 Images) \nMullinax’s hopes diminished when he chunked a pitch shot at the 17th hole, failing to clear a bunker between his ball and the hole. \nThe resulting bogey gave Landry the gift of a two-shot lead heading to the par-five 18th.
