    "text": "MADRID, April 25 (Reuters) - The head of the region of Madrid Cristina Cifuentes resigned on Wednesday after a turbulent month for the People’s Party (PP) politician which included claims she had falsified her masters degree and been caught shoplifting in 2011.\nMadrid has always been a stronghold for the centre-right party, led by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, but is under growing pressure from market-friendly Ciudadanos which has jumped ahead in the polls amid PP corruption scandals.\nA close circuit TV video published by newspaper OK Diario on Wednesday showed Cifuentes emptying her handbag for a security guard in a local supermarket after being accused of taking anti-aging cream.\nCifuentes, before tending her resignation, said taking the cream, worth around 40 euros, had been an “involuntarily error”.
