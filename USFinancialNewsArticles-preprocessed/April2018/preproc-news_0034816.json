REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko Picture Supplied by Action Images/File Photo \nThe Springbok captain, who has missed much of the past year with groin and knee problems, sustained a fresh injury in training on Monday and was made unavailable for his Super Rugby franchise, the Johannesburg-based Lions, on the advice of an orthopaedic surgeon. \nThe Lions left for a four-game Australasia tour without Whitely and no date was given for the player’s potential return to action.
