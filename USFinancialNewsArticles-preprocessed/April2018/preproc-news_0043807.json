Ganfeng is also a second-phase offtaker.\nPilbara Minerals is jointly investing in a downstream chemical facility in South Korea with Posco to tap the local battery market, with commissioning expected in late 2019, Brinsden said.\n“From our point of view we’re opening up a new supply chain to take the concentrate into South Korea, as opposed to just China,” where similar joint ventures are planned, he added.\nReporting by Tom Daly; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri and Christian Schmollinger\n ",
