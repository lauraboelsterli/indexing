    "text": "DALLAS, April 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RMG Networks Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:RMGN), or RMG, a global leader in technology-driven visual communications, and SCG Digital, LLC, announced today the execution of a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which SCG Digital, LLC, an affiliate of Mr. Gregory Sachs, RMG’s Executive Chairman, will acquire RMG in a transaction valued at approximately $16.8 million, including the assumption of approximately $2.65 million of debt.\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, RMG stockholders will receive $1.27 in cash for each share of RMG’s common stock they hold.\nThe board of directors of RMG, on the recommendation of a special committee of the board comprised entirely of independent directors, has approved the merger agreement and has resolved to recommend that RMG’s shareholders adopt the agreement.\nMr. Gregory H. Sachs and certain entities related to Mr. Sachs have reached agreements to vote their shares in favor of the transaction.\nUpon receipt of stockholder approval, as well as satisfaction of other closing conditions, the transaction is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018.\nUnder the terms of the merger agreement, the board of directors of RMG, through its special committee and with the assistance of Carl Marks Securities LLC, intends to solicit superior proposals for the acquisition of RMG during the next 45 days. RMG advises that there can be no assurance that the solicitation of superior proposals will result in an alternative transaction. RMG does not intend to disclose developments with respect to the solicitation process unless and until the special committee of the board has made a recommendation and the board of directors has made a decision.\nLake Street Capital Markets LLC has delivered a fairness opinion to the special committee of the board of directors of RMG. Carl Marks Securities LLC is acting as financial advisor to the special committee of the board of directors of RMG. Mayer Brown LLP is acting as legal advisor to RMG and DLA Piper LLP is acting as legal counsel to the special committee of the board of directors of RMG. Foley Gardere is acting as legal counsel to SCG Digital, LLC.\nSubordinated Debt Facility\nIn connection with the definitive merger agreement, RMG and certain of its subsidiaries, as borrowers, have entered into a subordinated loan and security agreement on April 2, 2018, with SCG Digital Financing, LLC as the lender, providing RMG with a $2 million bridge loan within one business day of the execution of such loan agreement. In the event that the merger agreement is terminated by RMG because SCG Digital, LLC fails to consummate the merger when otherwise obligated to do so, SCG Digital Financing, LLC will make an additional loan to RMG of $1 million, on terms governed by the subordinated loan agreement. SCG Digital Financing, LLC is an affiliate of Mr. Sachs and SCG Digital, LLC.\nThe bridge loan matures on the later of April 2, 2019 and, if the additional loan is funded, the first anniversary of the funding of the additional loan. No principal payments are required under either loan prior to maturity and, except in limited circumstances, no principal payments are permitted prior to the first anniversary of the closing date. Interest on the bridge loan accrues at a per annum cash interest rate equal to 8.0% above the prime rate plus 2.0% paid-in-kind, and interest on the additional loan will accrue at a per annum paid-in-kind interest rate equal to 5% above the prime rate. If the bridge loan is prepaid prior to the stated maturity date thereof, the borrowers are obligated to pay a prepayment premium equal to the interest the loans would have accrued if they had remained outstanding through maturity. During an event of default, the rate of interest on the loans would increase to 2.5% above the otherwise applicable rate, until such event of default is cured or waived. All accrued and unpaid cash interest is payable quarterly on the last day of each fiscal quarter.\nUpon the occurrence of certain events, the lender has the right to convert principal and accrued interest outstanding under the bridge loan into shares of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company on the terms set forth in the subordinated loan and security agreement.\nThe bridge loan and additional loan, if funded, are secured by a second priority lien in all of the assets of the borrowers.\nAmendment to Revolving Line of Credit\nOn April 2, 2018, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the First Amendment (the “First Amendment”) to the Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (the “Restated Loan Agreement”) with Silicon Valley Bank (the “Bank”). Pursuant to the First Amendment, the minimum EBITDA covenant in the Restated Loan Agreement was amended and the Bank consented to the incurrence of certain subordinated debt pursuant to a subordinated loan and security agreement by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, among other things.\nAbout RMG\nRMG (NASDAQ:RMGN) goes beyond traditional communications to help businesses increase productivity, efficiency and engagement through digital messaging. By combining best-in-class software, hardware, business applications and services, RMG offers a single point of accountability for integrated data visualization and real-time performance management.

INVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS ARE ADVISED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE, BECAUSE IT WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE MERGER AND THE PARTIES THERETO.

Information concerning the interests of RMG’s participants in the solicitation, which may be different than those of RMG stockholders generally, is set forth in RMG’s proxy statements and Annual Reports on Form 10-K, previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and in the proxy statement relating to the merger when it becomes available.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements based on current RMG management expectations.
