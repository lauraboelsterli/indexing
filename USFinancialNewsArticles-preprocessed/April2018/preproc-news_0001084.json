We believe we can continue to invest in the initiatives that are key to our future success as well as enhance the value of our Company by repurchasing common stock under this program.\"\nAbout Amtech Systems, Inc.\nAmtech Systems, Inc. is a global supplier of advanced thermal processing equipment to the solar, semiconductor / electronics, and LED manufacturing markets.

All statements in this press release, or made by management of Amtech Systems, Inc. and its subsidiaries (\"Amtech\"), other than statements of historical fact, are hereby identified as \"forward-looking statements\" (as such term is defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"would,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology or our management are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include statements regarding Amtech's future financial results, operating results, business strategies, projected costs, products under development, competitive positions, and plans and objectives of Amtech and its management for future operations. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. The Form 10-K, as amended, that Amtech filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") for the year-ended September 30, 2016, listed various important factors that could affect the company's future operating results and financial condition and could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results and expectations based on forward-looking statements made in this document or elsewhere by Amtech or on its behalf. These factors can be found under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in the Form 10-K and investors should refer to them. Because it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors, any such list cannot be considered a complete set of all potential risks or uncertainties. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nContacts:\nAmtech Systems, Inc.\nRobert T.
