    "text": "ALGIERS (Reuters) - At least 15 African migrants died on Sunday when their boat trying to reach Europe capsized off the Algerian coast, a coast guard official said.\nCoast guard and civil protection authorities rescued 19 of 34 people on board, state news agency APS said.\nThe boat sank off the coast of Oran, a city some 450 km west of the capital Algiers, the official told Ennahar TV station, adding that the boat had departed from Morocco.\nNo details on nationalities were provided.\nLast week, Algeriaâ€™s interior ministry said the North African country was suffering from an influx of illegal migrants from sub-Saharan countries as Europe had made boat departures more difficult from Libya and other countries.\nReporting by Lamine Chukhi and Hamid Ould Ahmed; editing by Ulf Laessing and Jason Neely\n ",
