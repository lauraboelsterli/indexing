    "text": "HOUSTON, April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gulf Island Fabrication, Inc. (“Gulf Island” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:GIFI) announced today that both of its Class III directors, Kirk J. Meche, Gulf Island’s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Michael J. Keeffe, were reelected at the Company’s 2018 annual meeting of shareholders, held yesterday.\nAccording to the final results, over 90% and 85% of the votes cast by shareholders were in favor of Messrs. Meche’s and Keeffe’s reelection, respectively.\nIn response to the annual meeting results, Jack Laborde, Chairman of the Board of Directors, made the following statement:\n“We sincerely thank our shareholders for their overwhelming support of our directors’ reelection. We also greatly appreciate the constructive dialogue we have had with many of our shareholders over the past several weeks leading up to the annual meeting. The annual meeting comes on the heels of the Company’s successful sale of its Texas South Yard, a capital infusion that is timely as we continue our strategic repositioning from offshore oil and gas markets to more diversified markets and customers. Kirk and Mike have played a pivotal role in the Company’s significant progress to date, which is reflected in the strong showing of support by shareholders for their reelection. We look forward to their continued service on our Board as we continue to execute on our strategy to maximize long-term value for all of our shareholders.\"\n“As part of our ongoing efforts to reduce costs across the Company and demonstrate the Board’s and management’s commitment to Gulf Island’s success, the Board has approved the following actions:\nreduce by 10% the cash compensation of each of the Company’s directors and reduce by 5% the cash compensation of each of the named executive officers;\nimplementation of an enterprise risk management process led by advisors and management;\nincrease the stock ownership guidelines for directors from 5,000 shares to 15,000 shares; and continue to assess and identify any opportunities to meaningfully enhance the Board’s collective skillset through Board refreshment.”\nIn other business conducted at the meeting, Gulf Island’s shareholders overwhelmingly approved, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Company’s named executive officers, as disclosed in the Company’s proxy statement (the “say on pay vote”), as well as the ratification of the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm.\nAbout Gulf Island:\nGulf Island Fabrication, Inc. is a leading fabricator of complex steel structures and marine vessels used in energy extraction and production, petrochemical and industrial facilities, power generation, alternative energy projects and shipping and marine transportation operations.
