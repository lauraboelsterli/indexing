    "text": "PARIS, April 9 (Reuters) - French police on Monday started to evacuate hundreds of eco-activists and anarchists squatting on a site in western France that had been planned as a new airport, and which had sparked clashes with previous governments.\nThe evacuation had started at 0600 Paris time (0400 GMT), the French interior ministry said.\nIn January, President Emmanuel Macronâ€™s government dropped plans for the 580-million-euro ($712-million) airport in Notre-Dame-des-Landes in western France, a sensitive decision that past governments had shirked for decades.\nSupporters of Notre-Dame-Des-Landes, designed to handle 4 million passengers a year initially, said it would aid economic development in the Loire-Atlantique region.\nThey argued an old, inner-city airport 30 km (19 miles) to the south was congested and a security risk.\nBut opponents said it was too costly, environmentally unfriendly and that there was another under-utilised airport 110 km (68 miles) to the north, near Rennes in Brittany.\nConstruction giant Vinci has said it is ready to discuss government compensation for loss of its earlier contract to develop Notre-Dame-des-Landes.
