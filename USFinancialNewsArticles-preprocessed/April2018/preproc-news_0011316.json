Prior to this, he spent 15 years at Morgan Stanley, including as Head of Infrastructure Banking for the Americas, originating and executing infrastructure transactions across various industries, including utilities and transportation.\nIn his new role, Perry will leverage his expertise to drive the expansion of REPM's infrastructure investment activity in the Americas, through its global platform of funds and mandates. He will be based in New York and report to Tommaso Albanese, Head of Infrastructure at UBS-AM.\nFloyd Gent, currently Head of Infrastructure Equity Americas, will take on a new portfolio company-focused senior advisory role, supporting the expansion of our business in the region. We are pleased that we continue to benefit from his extensive knowledge and nearly 40 years of investment industry experience, including eight years at UBS-AM.\nVanessa Lamort De Gail recently joined the team as a Portfolio Manager.
