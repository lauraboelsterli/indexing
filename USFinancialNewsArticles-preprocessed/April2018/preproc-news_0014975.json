This is a thoughtful process and in the capable hands of management, several outside expert resources, and our financial and operational savvy Board who are all passionate about the future of the Company.”\nIP Licensing and Settlement Updates:\nAs disclosed in the Company’s March 1, 2018, 8K filing with the SEC, a confidential settlement agreement was entered into with a licensee for $65 million, plus an additional $45 million upon the licensee satisfying certain qualifying events over the course of the next four years.
