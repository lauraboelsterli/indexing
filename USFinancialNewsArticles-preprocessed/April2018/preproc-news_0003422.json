(NYSE: MD), today announced the acquisition of Children’s Urology Associates, P.A., a private pediatric urology practice based in Miami.\nChildren’s Urology was established in 1999 and employs six physicians, all fellowship trained in pediatric urology, as well as four physician assistants and advanced registered nurse practitioners. The practice provides consult, surgery, cystoscopy, circumcision, ultrasound and urinalysis services to children. It is both office and hospital-based in three counties (Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach), servicing Baptist Children's Hospital, Broward Health Medical Center, Jackson Memorial Hospital, Kendall Regional Medical Center, Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital, Nicklaus Children's Hospital and Miami Children’s Ambulatory Surgery Center, West Boca Medical Center and South Miami Hospital.
