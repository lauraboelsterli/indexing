    "text": "(Reuters) - Tesla Inc ( TSLA.O ) was reported to be making 2,000 of its Model 3 sedans per week, enough to ease stock market nerves around billionaire Elon Musk’s electric carmaker on Monday after a week dominated by news of a crash involving its semi-autonomous autopilot.\nMusk told employees in a company-wide email on Monday that Tesla had just passed the 2,000 per week rate, according to auto website Jalopnik.\nThat was short of its 2,500 per week target but a big increase on the 793 Model 3s that the company built in the final week of last year. It produced 2,425 of the cars in the whole fourth quarter. [nL4N1OY42A\nSlideshow (2 Images) Tesla shares recovered from an 8 percent loss before the Jalopnik report filtered into markets to trade down 3.5 percent on the day. bit.ly/2uFdEBr\nThe company did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nJalopnik also Quote: d Musk in the email to employees as saying: “If things go as planned today, we will comfortably exceed that number over a seven day period!”\nReporting by Sonam Rai in Bengaluru, Editing by Peter Henderson and Patrick Graham\n ",
