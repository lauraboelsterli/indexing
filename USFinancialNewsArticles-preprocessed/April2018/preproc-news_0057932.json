    "text": "1 COMMENTS BEIJING—China’s central bank formally adopted far-reaching rules to rein in risky lending in the financial system, though regulators are giving banks and asset managers longer than expected to comply.\nFriday’s release of the asset-management regulations followed five months of delay and pushback by commercial lenders , which warned that a forced unwinding of products could touch off market volatility.\nThe rules require financial institutions to set aside more capital for loans repackaged as investments and closes off regulatory loopholes that banks used to collaborate with nonbank, or “shadow,” lenders and move loans off-the-books. Analysts have described the regulations as important to a now two-year-old government campaign to control the country’s level of debt, which has climbed to more than 260% of the economy.\nThe People’s Bank of China, in releasing the new rules, pointed to those shadow banks and their previously inadequate regulation as a problem that “interferes with macro control, raises the financing costs for society, and exacerbates the spread of financial risk across industries and markets.” The rules, it said, are meant to “address regulatory shortcomings and improve the effectiveness of supervision.”\nAside from debt, links between banks and shadow banks have provided critical fuel for companies to expand and help the government to keep the Chinese economy growing. Beijing has recently shown concern that a too hasty reduction in leverage might undercut the economy; the central bank recently cut the amount of capital banks are supposed to set aside in reserves.\nThe final version of the asset-management rules contains two key concessions by Beijing on when the rules take effect and valuation of assets.\n“If you put too many rules on shadow banking, then you’re going to throttle credit,” said Andrew Collier, managing director at Hong Kong-based due diligence firm Orient Capital Research. “It sounds to me like this is a political compromise between the strict regulators and the local government which wants to push credit through.”\nFinancial institutions are being given until the end of 2020 to comply fully with the rules; that lengthens the timetable to 2½ years, from one-and-a-half in the draft floated last November .\nChinese authorities also relaxed a requirement for banks to adjust the value of assets underlying their investment products to reflect the latest market value. Banks contended that such a change would make it more difficult to package assets into investment products for retail investors. Instead, the final rules allow banks more leeway in determining the value of assets.\n—Grace Zhu contributed to this article.\nWrite to Chao Deng at Chao.Deng@wsj.com",
