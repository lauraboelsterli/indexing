    "text": "April 4, 2018 / 3:44 PM / Updated 22 minutes ago French PM, Senate agree to cut lawmakers number by almost a third Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nPARIS (Reuters) - France will cut the number of lawmakers by 30 percent and 15 percent of members of parliament will be elected via a proportional representation voting system in the 2022 legislative elections, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said on Wednesday. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe adresses the media during a news conference at the Hotel de Matignon in Paris, France, April 4, 2018. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier \nThe measures, broadly in line with President Emmanuel Macron’s campaign promises, are the result of an agreement between his centrist government and the opposition-controlled Senate, whose support is essential to pass the reforms. \n“These bills will contribute to a deep renovation of political and parliamentary life, in a spirit of responsibility, representativity and efficiency,” Philippe said.
