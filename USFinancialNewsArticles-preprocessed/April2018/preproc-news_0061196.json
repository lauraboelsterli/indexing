    "text": "0 COMMENTS Financial-technology firm GreenSky Inc., a provider of point-of-sale financing and payments technology, disclosed plans to go public.\nThe Atlanta company, which operates a lending platform that enables retailers, health-care providers and home contractors to offer loans to their customers, filed preliminary documents Friday for an initial public offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nThe filing lists a proposed offering amount of $100 million but that is a placeholder figure likely to change. The company intends to trade under the symbol GSKY, but didn’t disclose where its shares would list.\nEarlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported GreenSky confidentially filed IPO paperwork with the SEC, according to people familiar with the matter at the time. The Journal reported the company could seek to raise $1 billion at a valuation of roughly $5 billion, some of the people had said.\nGreenSky’s total revenue in 2017 was $325.9 million, compared with $263.9 million in 2016 and $173.5 million in 2015, according to the SEC filing. The company posted a profit of $138.7 million in 2017, compared with $124.5 million in 2016 and $93.8 million in 2015.\nGreenSky Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of GreenSky LLC. Following a reorganization and the IPO, GreenSky, Inc. will be a holding company and the managing member of GreenSky Holdings LLC.\nGreenSky plans to use the IPO proceeds to pay the expenses of the IPO and for general corporate purposes, the filing said.\nPrincipal shareholders are company Chief Executive David Zalik, director Robert Sheft, executive Jeffrey Gold, and asset managers Pacific Investment Management Co. LLC and TPG.\nAn IPO of GreenSky would end the drought in IPOs of financial-technology companies.\nDespite the large amount of financing that private investors have poured into lending startups, IPOs have been rare in recent years due in part to concerns around rising defaults among their borrowers and increased competition.\nGoldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley are leading the offering and investment bank Financial Technology Partners LP is serving as GreenSky’s IPO adviser.\nWrite to Aisha Al-Muslim at aisha.al-muslim@wsj.com",
