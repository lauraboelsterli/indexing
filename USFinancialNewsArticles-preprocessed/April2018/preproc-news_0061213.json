    "text": "7 COMMENTS Hedge-fund manager John Paulson attending a tennis match in New York in 2011. He made about $20 billion by betting against the housing market and financial companies. Photo: Rick Maiman/Bloomberg News A decade after the financial crisis , The Wall Street Journal has checked in on dozens of the bankers, government officials, chief executives, hedge-fund managers and others who left a mark on that period to find out what they are doing now. Today, we spotlight hedge-fund managers David Einhorn and John Paulson.\nThe investor who made the largest fortune betting on the U.S. housing-market collapse has struggled to get much right ever since.\nHedge-fund manager John Paulson made about $20 billion buying derivatives that served as insurance on risky mortgages and shorting, or betting against, financial companies ahead of the financial crisis.\nA vacant lot on Riverwood Way owned by John Paulson in Aurora, Col., in August 2011. Photo: Rick Wilking/REUTERS For a while, his hot hand continued. His firm, Paulson & Co., was among the first to shift to gold , benefiting from a subsequent rally. The fund prematurely turned bullish on the U.S. economy , but its bullish bets eventually paid off as the market took off in 2009. Investors flocked and by 2011 his firm was managing $38 billion.\nThen, Mr. Paulson’s fortunes reversed. His touch has gone frigid in recent years, his firm’s performance crippled by losses in drug stocks, collapsing gold companies, and even a Chinese fraud , forestry company Sino-Forest Corp.\nHe also bought four hotels in Puerto Rico at discounted prices. Hurricane Maria left the U.S. territory in ruins, making Puerto Rican investments more challenging , but someone close to the firm said the Paulson hotels are about 95% full.\nRelated David Einhorn Finds Victories More Elusive Since Winning Lehman Bet Ben Bernanke Loosens Up During His Post-Crisis Years Ex-Iceland Leader Now Hosting Movie Nights as Ambassador to the U.S . Where Are They Now: The Biggest Figures From the Financial Crisis Nobody Thinks the Bailout Would Happen Again A Decade Later, Seeds of Instability Are Germinating How Bear Wrecked Something More Valuable than Money Mr. Paulson, a 62-year-old Queens, N.Y., native who spent years as a merger arbitrager, was little known on Wall Street in 2006, the year he began executing the trade that would make his fortune.\nHe became convinced that problems were ahead for the U.S. economy, amid a frenzied pace of buying by homeowners, some strapped for cash. His firm bought boatloads of derivatives that served as protection against bundles of potentially toxic mortgages.\nSome clients fretted. Mr. Paulson had little expertise in mortgage investing, but when the subprime market collapsed in value in 2007, the firm made $15 billion, t he largest one-year payout in the history of the financial markets.\nMr. Paulson then took bearish positions on shares of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., British banks such as Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC and Lloyds Banking Group PLC, and other firms with housing exposure, scoring another $5 billion in profits in 2008 as the U.S. dipped into a recession. That year, Mr. Paulson traded up in Southampton, N.Y., spending $41 million for a 10-acre lakefront estate.\nJohn Paulson announcing a donation to the Central Park Conservancy in 2012.

But he manages less than $9 billion, most of which is his own money, after client defections.\nPaulson & Co. has been letting employees go and is moving into smaller New York offices in the headquarters of Steinway & Sons, the piano maker purchased by Mr. Paulson’s firm for more than $500 million in 2013. Recently, Mr. Paulson made a historic $1.5 billion tax payment for gains from the subprime trade that had been deferred for a decade.\nEven giving away some of his fortune, Mr. Paulson has taken some flak. After he pledged $400 million in 2015 to Harvard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the largest gift in the university’s history, some noted that Harvard wasn’t an especially needy cause. He also made a $20 million gift to New York University and a $100 million donation to the Central Park Conservancy. Mr. Paulson still walks through the park on his way home many evenings.\nWrite to Gregory Zuckerman at gregory.zuckerman@wsj.com",
