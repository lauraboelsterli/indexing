    "text": "Anibal Sanchez pitched six solid innings and Preston Tucker slugged a three-run homer as the visiting Atlanta Braves beat the Chicago Cubs 4-0 on Friday afternoon at Wrigley Field.\nSanchez (1-0) allowed three hits in his second career outing for Atlanta, and snapped a personal six-game losing streak to record his first win since beating the New York Yankees July 31. He also recorded his first win as a National Leaguer since beating the Cubs at Wrigley Field on July 17, 2012, while pitching for the Florida Marlins.\nSanchez struck out six, walked one while throwing 94 pitches and got seven outs on the ground as the Braves recorded their first shutout at Wrigley Field since Aug. 22, 2011\nRookie Ozzie Albies doubled twice for the Braves. In his last nine games, the second baseman is batting .385 (15-for-39) with 10 of his 12 extra-base hits since starting the season with two hits in his first 20 at-bats.\nBesides contributing offensively, Albies also made diving stops on ground balls hit by Kyle Schwarber and Willson Contreras.\nTucker hit his third three-run homer of the season as Atlanta improved to 8-0 when hitting a homer.\nYu Darvish (0-1) allowed four runs on nine hits in 4 2/3 innings in his home debut for the Cubs. He also committed a throwing error on a pickoff attempt, a wild pitch, and a balk.\nThe Cubs lost for the third time in four games and were shut out for the third time this season. Chicago had just five baserunners.\nAfter Albies made a diving stop at second to get Schwarber’s ground ball into the shift for the first out in the fourth, he helped create Atlanta’s first run in the fifth. With one out he doubled to right field, took third on a balk and scored on a wild pitch.\nFollowing the wild pitch, Darvish allowed a double to Nick Markakis and a single to Kurt Suzuki. Five pitches later, Tucker lifted a 3-1 slider well over the right-field bleachers for a four-run lead.\nDarvish was knocked out after allowing an infield single to Ryan Flaherty and a walk to Sanchez that loaded the bases.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
