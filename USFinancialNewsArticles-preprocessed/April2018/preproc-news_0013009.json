February's exports fell 2 percent from a year earlier, easing sharply from the 17.9 percent rise recorded in January. A Reuters poll had forecast an 8.3 percent gain in February. Analysts had warned Malaysia's trade data could be distorted by the timing of the Lunar New Year holidays, which began in mid-February compared to late-January the previous year. It was the first decline in exports since October 2016. Exports of mining goods and agricultural goods declined 10.2 percent and 23.3 percent respectively, data from the International Trade and Industry Ministry showed. But shipments of manufactured goods, which account for over 80 percent of Malaysia's exports, rose 1.5 percent from a year earlier, the data showed. Imports in February declined 2.8 percent from a year earlier, the weakest pace since October 2016, and down from an 11.6 percent growth in January. Malaysia reports trade data in ringgit. The currency has been one of Asia's best performers in the past year, strengthening about 14 percent. February's trade surplus narrowed to 9 billion ringgit ($2.33 billion), compared with 9.7 billion ringgit in January. Exports to China, a major trading partner, fell 9.7 percent year-on-year in February, although trade remained strong, rising 7.1 percent. Shipments to the United States rose 3.3 percent from a year earlier, on the back of higher exports of manufactured goods. For January and February combined, exports grew 7.8 percent, while imports rose by 4.6 percent, compared to the corresponding period in 2017.
