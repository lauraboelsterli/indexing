    "text": "Controversy swirls around White House Correspondent's Dinner after profane headline performance Matthew J. Belvedere â€¢ April 29, 2018 Wolf's performance, which included a harsh skewering of White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, left the media sharply divided over its level of propriety. Criticism mounted on Sunday over the entertainment at the annual White House Correspondent's Dinner, where the headlining comedian launched into a profanity-laced diatribe that skewered Washington's political establishment, in a way that even some journalists thought crossed a line. For the second year, President Donald Trump skipped the annual confab, dubbed \"Nerd Prom\" by attendees. ",
