    "text": "PORTLAND, Ore., April 11, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- True West Capital Partners (True West), a provider of growth capital to middle-market companies in the Western U.S., led a $20 million junior capital investment in Eugene, Ore.-based Bulk Handling Systems (BHS). BHS will use the capital to pursue growth opportunities. Los Angeles-based Caltius Structured Capital , which financed a management buyout of BHS in 2008 and is an equity owner of the company, co-invested in the financing.\nBHS designs, manufactures and installs waste processing systems tailored to extract recyclables from the general waste stream. Its highly-automated waste processing equipment reduces landfilling by identifying and sorting recyclables from general waste objects picked up curbside, or from commercial or industrial byproducts. BHS recently launched Max-AI™, a robotic sorting system that uses artificial intelligence to select and sort specifically identified objects from the waste stream with 95 percent precision. The technology is recognized for dramatically improving the quality of materials generated at the sorting facility while also improving safety at material recovery facilities.\nBHS has completed hundreds of installations in the past 10 years on five continents, including projects with many of the world’s most successful and automated systems.\n“We look for companies in the Western U.S. with the desire to lead their industries through innovation, service and ingenuity,” said Steve Wilkins, managing director and co-founder of True West. “Bulk Handling Systems’ material handling equipment, NRT optimal sorting technology and NIHOT air separation technology have set the standard for material recovery facilities. These technologies, when combined with recent innovations such as Max-AI™ and Zero Waste, will enable waste haulers and material recovery facilities to meet new state and federally-mandated benchmarks for waste recovery across the globe. It is an important moment for governments, municipalities and waste management partners to see BHS’ performance, and for the company to be in a position for growth globally.”\n“This investment comes at a time where we are projecting substantial growth due in large part to our launch of the Max-AI™ product,” said Steve Miller, CEO of BHS. “We see a zero waste future and have an increasing number of communities committed to that goal because their residents demand it.”\nAbout True West Capital Partners\nTrue West provides flexible junior capital to growing middle-market companies in the Western United States with revenues of $20 - $250 million and EBITDA of $3 – $25 million. Founded in 2009, True West is dedicated to building and maintaining long-term relationships with the management teams of its portfolio companies, its investors and its business community.
