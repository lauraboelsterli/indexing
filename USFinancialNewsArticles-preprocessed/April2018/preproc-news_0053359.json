Revenue for the quarter was $591.6 million, a 15 percent increase compared to the same period of the prior year.\n“We had a strong quarter, with solid revenue growth at the top line, and operating leverage improving the bottom line,” said ResMed CEO Mick Farrell. “Our cloud-connected medical device strategy is succeeding; the major markets for our sleep business are adopting remote monitoring systems, which plays to the strength of our offerings. Our mask business performed well across all markets, and our cloud-based software-as-a-service business also grew rapidly in Q3.”\n“We believe we are well-positioned,” Farrell said. “We continue to innovate. We are improving our existing products and solutions, and have a robust pipeline for the future.”\nAnalysis of third quarter results\nThird quarter revenue in the United States, Canada and Latin America, excluding Brightree, was $317.5 million, a 7 percent increase over the same period of the prior year. Brightree revenue for the third quarter was $39.9 million, an increase of 14 percent compared to the same period of the prior year. Revenue in combined Europe, Asia and other markets was $234.2 million, an increase of 16 percent on a constant currency basis, compared to the same period of the prior year.\nGross margin in the third quarter was 58.2 percent, lower than the prior year’s quarter gross margin of 58.3 percent, mainly due to declines in average selling prices, which were partially offset by manufacturing and procurement efficiencies.\nIncome from operations for the quarter was $136.4 million, a 27 percent increase compared with the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Non-GAAP income from operations for the quarter was $159.0 million, a 25 percent increase compared to the same period of the prior year.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $147.9 million, a 7 percent increase over the same period in the prior year, or a 3 percent increase on a constant currency basis. SG&A expenses improved to 25.0 percent of revenue in the quarter, compared with 26.8 percent reported in the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nResearch and development expenses were $37.4 million, or 6.3 percent of revenue. R&D expenses increased by 7 percent compared with the same period last year, or a 4 percent increase on a constant currency basis.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets was $11.7 million during the quarter, which is consistent with the same period last year. Stock-based compensation costs incurred during the quarter of $12.0 million consisted of expenses associated with employee equity grants and ResMed’s employee stock purchase plan.\nNet income for the quarter was $110.1 million, a 25 percent increase compared to the same period of the prior year. Non-GAAP net income was $132.5 million, a 32 percent increase compared to the prior year.\nNon-GAAP measures adjust for amortization of acquired intangibles, the impact of U.S. tax reform on income tax expense, restructuring expenses, litigation settlement expenses, acquisition-related expenses and the Astral battery field safety notification expenses.\nGAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased by 23 percent to $0.76. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.92 were 30 percent higher compared with the same period of the prior year.\nCash flow from operations for the quarter was $149.1 million compared to net income in the current quarter of $110.1 million. During the quarter ResMed paid $50.0 million in dividends.\nImpact of U.S. tax reform on income tax expense\nOn December 22, 2017, “H.R.1,” originally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was enacted into law (“U.S. tax reform”). ASC 740 Income Taxes requires companies to recognize the effect of any tax laws during the period in which they are enacted. Accordingly, during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, ResMed performed preliminary calculations which have been refined during the current quarter. Based on these refinements and additional guidance from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, ResMed recognized additional income tax expense of $5.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018, for a total income tax expense of $132.2 million during the nine months ended March 31, 2018.\nThe U.S. tax reform significantly revises the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, imposing a one-time transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings, lowering the corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and implementing a territorial tax system in regard to foreign earnings. The one-time transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings results in additional income tax expense of $5.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and $125.5 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018. ResMed recorded $11.4 million in income taxes payable and $114.1 million as long-term income taxes payable for the transition tax. The lower corporate tax rate reduces net deferred tax assets by $6.7 million and increases income tax expense by $6.7 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018. The amounts recorded as part of U.S. tax reform should be considered provisional and may continue to be revised through ResMed’s quarter ending December 31, 2018.\nAustralian Taxation Office audit update\nIn connection with the audit by the Australian Taxation Office (“ATO”) for the tax years 2009 through 2013, ResMed received Notices of Amended Assessments in March 2018. Based on these assessments, the ATO is asserting that ResMed owes $151.7 million in additional income tax and $38.4 million in accrued interest. In April 2018, ResMed agreed to a payment arrangement with the ATO to pay $75.9 million, 50 percent of the additional assessed tax, with the remaining amounts only due if it is unsuccessful in defending its position. ResMed does not agree with the ATO’s assessments and intends to pursue administrative and legal steps to defend its position. ResMed continues to believe it will be successful in defending its position and therefore has not recognized any income tax expense in relation to these assessments. At March 31, 2018, ResMed recorded a liability of $75.9 million in short-term income taxes payable, which was offset by an equivalent asset recorded in other long-term assets.\nDebt refinancing\nOn April 16, 2018, ResMed entered into a new unsecured syndicated facility (“Facility”) that provides for an $800 million five-year revolving Credit Facility and a $200 million five-year Term Loan. The proceeds from the initial funding of the Term Loan were used to repay a portion of the outstanding balance of the Credit Facility. As a result of the refinancing, ResMed has classified the outstanding balance at March 31, 2018, as long-term debt.\nShare repurchase program\nDuring the quarter, ResMed repurchased 200,000 shares at a cost of $19.4 million, as part of its ongoing capital management program.\nDividend program\nThe ResMed board of directors today declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.35 per share. The dividend will have a record date of May 10, 2018, payable on June 14, 2018. The dividend will be paid in U.S. currency to holders of ResMed’s common stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Holders of Chess Depositary Instruments trading on the Australian Securities Exchange will receive an equivalent amount in Australian currency, based on the exchange rate on the record date, and reflecting the 10:1 ratio between CDIs and NYSE shares. The ex-dividend date will be May 9, 2018, for common stock holders and for CDI holders. ResMed has received a waiver from the ASX’s settlement operating rules, which will allow ResMed to defer processing conversions between its common stock and CDI registers from May 9, 2018, through May 10, 2018, inclusive.\nWebcast details\nResMed will discuss its third quarter fiscal year 2018 results on its webcast at 1:30 p.m. U.S. Pacific Time today.

ResMed uses non-GAAP information internally in planning, forecasting and evaluating the results of operations in the current period and in comparing it to past periods. ResMed believes this information provides investors better insight in evaluating ResMed’s performance from core operations and provides consistent financial reporting. ResMed’s use of non-GAAP measures is intended to supplement, and not to replace, its presentation of net income and other GAAP measures. Like all non-GAAP measures, non-GAAP earnings are subject to inherent limitations because they do not include all the expenses that must be included under GAAP.\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180426006291/en/\nResMed\nFor investors:\nDavid Pendarvis\n+1 858.836.5000\ninvestorrelations@resmed.com\nor\nFor media:\nJayme Rubenstein\n+1 858.836.6798\nnews@resmed.com\nSource: ResMed",
