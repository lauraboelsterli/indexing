    "text": "CALABASAS, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Unico American Corporation (NASDAQ – “UNAM”) (“Unico,” the “Company”), announced today its consolidated financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, revenues were $9.3 million and net loss was $2.8 million ($0.52 diluted loss per share) compared with revenues of $9.0 million and net income of $0.6 million ($0.11 diluted earnings per share) for the three months ended December 31, 2016. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, revenues were $36.8 million and net loss was $8.7 million ($1.64 diluted loss per share) compared with revenue of $35.3 million and net loss of $1.4 million ($0.26 diluted loss per share) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nStockholders’ equity was $59.9 million as of December 31, 2017, or $11.30 per common share including net unrealized after-tax investment losses of $0.2 million, compared to stockholders’ equity of $68.9 million as of December 31, 2016, or $12.98 per common share including net unrealized after-tax investment gains of $0.008 million.\n“While we realized a loss during our fourth quarter, we also experienced improving trends in both loss ratios and investment yields, and we assigned top priority to the achievement of immediate, less speculative results,” said Cary L. Cheldin, Unico’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “To achieve those results, we have realigned priorities, focusing our attention on the improvement of loss ratios and the reduction of expenses. In fact, loss ratios improved during the quarter and we expect continued improvement as increased rates and a refined risk selection process both take hold. It is important to note that over three quarters of our net loss during the quarter was due to adjustments from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The management team and I are excited about the opportunities ahead of us and we are optimistic about our future.”\nAbout Unico\nHeadquartered in Calabasas, California, Unico is an insurance holding company that underwrites property and casualty insurance through its insurance company subsidiary; provides property, casualty and health insurance through its agency subsidiaries; and through its other subsidiaries provides insurance premium financing and membership association services.
