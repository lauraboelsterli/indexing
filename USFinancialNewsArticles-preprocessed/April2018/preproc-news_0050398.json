    "text": "Reported income from continuing operations of $0.05 per diluted share Adjusted income from continuing operations of $0.41 per diluted share, excluding a write-down in Venezuela\nHOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Halliburton Company (NYSE:HAL) announced today income from continuing operations of $46 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018. This compares to a loss from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2017 of $32 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. Adjusted income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018, excluding impairments and other charges related to a write-down of all of the Company’s remaining investment in Venezuela, was $358 million, or $0.41 per diluted share. This compares to adjusted income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2017, excluding costs related to an early extinguishment of debt, of $34 million, or $0.04 per diluted share. Reported operating income was $354 million during the first quarter of 2018, compared to operating income of $203 million in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding impairments and other charges, adjusted operating income for the first quarter of 2018 was $619 million.\n“We achieved total company revenue of $5.7 billion, representing a 34% increase compared to the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted operating income was $619 million, primarily driven by robust market conditions in North America,” remarked Jeff Miller, President and CEO.\n“Our Completions and Production division was negatively impacted by delays in sand delivery, due to weather related rail interruptions during the quarter, but achieved a strong March exit with margins in the mid-upper teens. Our Drilling and Evaluations division had strong year over year revenue growth of 15% while operating income grew 54%.\n“I am very pleased with the way our North America business exited the quarter. Activity in U.S. land remains resilient as our customers have a large portfolio of economically viable projects in today’s commodity price environment. As a result of the improved activity in U.S. land, in March we achieved a new record for stages per spread as the pressure pumping market remains tight. Our North America business exited the quarter in a strong position and I am confident in our ability to reach normalized margins in North America this year.\n“Turning to the international markets, Halliburton has never been better positioned for a recovery than it is today. I am confident in the strength and performance our business will demonstrate as the international recovery unfolds.\n“Overall, I am optimistic about Halliburton’s relative performance for the remainder of the year, and our ability to grow our North America margins and to maximize the value of our global footprint. We are executing our strategy, it is working well and it resonates with our customers. Our strategy is delivering industry leading returns and I am confident that it will continue to do so,” concluded Miller.\nOperating Segments\nCompletion and Production\nCompletion and Production revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $3.8 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion, or 46%, from the first quarter of 2017, while operating income tripled to $500 million. Improvements were led by increased activity in the United States land sector. Additionally, results improved due to increased well completion services in Europe/Africa/CIS and higher stimulation activity in the Middle East.\nDrilling and Evaluation\nDrilling and Evaluation revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $1.9 billion, an increase of $258 million, or 15%, from the first quarter of 2017, while operating income was $188 million, an increase of $66 million, or 54% year over year. These increases were primarily due to increased drilling activity in North America and the Eastern Hemisphere, specifically in the North Sea. Results were partially offset by activity declines across multiple product service lines in Latin America.\nCorporate and Other Events\nAs a result of recent changes in the foreign currency exchange system in Venezuela and continued devaluation of the local currency, combined with U.S. sanctions and ongoing political and economic challenges, Halliburton wrote down all of its remaining investment in the country during the first quarter of 2018. This resulted in a charge of $312 million, net of tax, consisting of $151 million of receivables, $53 million of fixed assets, $48 million of inventory, $13 million of other assets and liabilities, and $47 million of accrued taxes. The Company is maintaining its presence in Venezuela and is carefully managing its go-forward exposure.\nGeographic Regions\nNorth America\nNorth America revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $3.5 billion, a 58% increase year over year. This improvement was driven by increased activity throughout the United States land sector in the majority of Halliburton’s product service lines, primarily pressure pumping, as well as higher drilling and artificial lift activity.\nInternational\nInternational revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $2.2 billion, a 9% increase year over year, resulting primarily from increased drilling activity and pressure pumping services in the Eastern Hemisphere, as well as pressure pumping activity in Argentina. These increases were partially offset by reduced drilling activity in Latin America.\nLatin America revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $457 million, a 1% decrease year over year, resulting primarily from activity declines across multiple product service lines in Venezuela, as well as decreases in pressure pumping and project management activity in Mexico. These results were partially offset by increases in pressure pumping services and drilling activity in Argentina.\nEurope/Africa/CIS revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $716 million, a 19% increase year over year, mainly due to higher drilling activity and well completion services in the North Sea, coupled with increased activity in Russia and Azerbaijan. These results were partially offset by activity reductions in Angola.\nMiddle East/Asia revenue in the first quarter of 2018 was $1.1 billion, a 7% increase year over year, largely resulting from increased drilling and stimulation activity in the Middle East and increased drilling activity in Indonesia, offset by lower completion tool sales and project management activity in the Middle East.\nSelective Technology & Highlights\nHalliburton announced a multimillion dollar software grant to the Colleges of Science and Engineering at Sultan Qaboos University in Oman. The grant provides access to leading industry software in geoscience, drilling and reservoir management so that students can gain practical experience to prepare for successful careers in the oil and gas industry. Halliburton announced that its Angolan facilities, Luanda-SONILS base, which incorporates the Cabinda-Malembo base and Soyo-Kwanda base facilities, and all of the company's product service lines in those locations have received the American Petroleum Institute (API) Specification Q2 Registration. The facilities are the first in Angola to receive this registration, an advanced industry quality standard for oil and natural gas service companies. Halliburton launched Quasar Trio®, the industry's first full M/LWD service capable of operating in extreme environments and the WiFire™ Acoustic Firing Head, a technology that provides an alternative way of activating tubing-conveyed perforating guns. Both offerings earned the OTC Spotlight Award for their innovation. The Quasar Trio service surpasses the limits of traditional LWD systems to offer a comprehensive suite of real-time measurements to help operators enhance reservoir understanding, make critical financial decisions earlier in the well construction process and reduce well time. Halliburton's CoreVault™ RFPX technology is the first and only wireline rotary sidewall coring system that captures and preserves both reservoir rock and fluid samples within a high pressure encapsulated vessel for accurate hydrocarbon in place determination. High-pressure cores captured using the new advanced nitrogen pressure compensated RFPX system for a customer in West Texas confirmed a six-fold increase in recorded pressure as compared with the previous generation tool deployed in the same field.\nAbout Halliburton\nFounded in 1919, Halliburton is one of the world's largest providers of products and services to the energy industry.

Management analyzes operating income without the impact of these items as an indicator of performance, to identify underlying trends in the business, and to establish operational goals. The adjustments remove the effect of these items. Adjusted operating income is calculated as: “As reported operating income” plus \"Impairments and other charges\" for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. There were no such charges for the three months ended March 31, 2017.

Management analyzes income (loss) from continuing operations without the impact of these items as an indicator of performance, to identify underlying trends in the business and to establish operational goals. The adjustment removes the effect of these items. Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to company is calculated as: “As reported income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to company” plus \"Total adjustments, net of taxes\" for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017. (b) Represents $47 million of accrued taxes in Venezuela for the charge taken during the three months ended March 31, 2018. (c) As reported diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2017 excludes options to purchase four million shares of common stock as their impact would be antidilutive because Halliburton's reported income from continuing operations attributable to company was in a loss position during the period. When adjusting income from continuing operations attributable to company in the period for the adjustments discussed above, these shares become dilutive. (d) As reported income (loss) from continuing operations per diluted share is calculated as: \"As reported income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to company\" divided by \"As reported diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.\" Adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share is calculated as: \"Adjusted income from continuing operations attributable to company\" divided by \"Adjusted diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.\" HALLIBURTON COMPANY\nConference Call Details\nHalliburton will host a conference call on Monday, April 23, 2018, to discuss the first quarter 2018 financial results.
