    "text": "Germany closing in on deal to buy first weapons-capable drone The deal, worth nearly 900 million euros, includes training and maintenance costs and has been politically contentious. Published 8 Hours Ago The Associated Press Airbus \nGermany is close to finalizing a deal that will see the country buy its first weapons-capable drone aircraft — an Israeli designed model — from European aerospace giant Airbus . \nThe deal, worth nearly 900 million euros ($1.1 billion) including training and maintenance costs, has been politically contentious because of fears that having combat drones might make Germany more likely to participate in military action abroad. \nIn a written response to questions from opposition Left party lawmaker Andre Hunko, Germany's defense ministry says it aims to sign an agreement by the end of May. \nThe government response, obtained by The Associated Press late Friday, adds the agreement foresees the deployment of the German Heron TP drones by mid-2020. \nThe initial deal doesn't cover the purchase of weapons systems or training in their use.",
