    "text": "MALVERN, Pa., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE) today announced its operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\n“We are pleased with our first quarter results that reflect steady, broad-based demand and a competitive pricing environment,” commented President and Chief Executive Officer Christopher P. Marr. “Demand for our third-party management services remains strong, expanding our national portfolio and strengthening our brand in targeted markets. We are well positioned for the busy rental season and remain focused on generating attractive risk-adjusted returns for shareholders.”\nKey Highlights for the Quarter\nReported earnings per share (“EPS”) attributable to the Company’s common shareholders of $0.19. Reported funds from operations (“FFO”) per share, as adjusted, of $0.39, representing a year-over-year increase of 8.3%. Increased same-store (458 stores) net operating income (“NOI”) 4.0% year over year, driven by 3.8% revenue growth and a 3.4% increase in property operating expenses. Averaged 91.9% same-store occupancy during the quarter, ending March at 92.5%, a 20 basis point increase year over year. Closed on one property acquisition totaling $12.2 million. Added 47 stores to our third-party management platform during the quarter, bringing our total third-party managed store count to 496.\nFinancial Results\nNet income attributable to the Company’s common shareholders was $34.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $25.0 million for the first quarter of 2017. EPS attributable to the Company’s common shareholders was $0.19 for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.14 for the same period last year.\nFFO, as adjusted, was $71.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $65.7 million for the first quarter of 2017. FFO per share, as adjusted, increased 8.3% to $0.39 for the first quarter of 2018, compared with $0.36 for the same period last year.\nInvestment Activity\nAcquisition Activity\nThe Company acquired a store in Texas for $12.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018. Additionally, the Company is under contract to acquire two properties located in Texas and Washington, D.C. for $53.7 million that are expected to close by the third quarter of 2018.\nUnconsolidated Joint Venture Activity\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company’s joint venture, HVP IV, acquired four properties located in Arizona (2), Maryland and Texas for $51.0 million, of which the Company contributed $10.3 million. Subsequent to quarter-end, HVP IV acquired a store in Florida for $19.0 million and has three properties under contract, located in Florida, Georgia, and Texas, for $23.9 million that are expected to close during the second quarter of 2018.\nDevelopment Activity\nThe Company has agreements with developers for the construction of Class A self-storage properties. These agreements are structured as either purchases at completion of construction and issuance of certificate of occupancy (“C/O”) or as joint venture developments. The Company did not acquire any properties at C/O or open for operation any development properties during the first quarter of 2018.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had two properties under contract to purchase at C/O for a total acquisition price of $40.0 million. The stores are located in California and Florida. The purchases of the two properties are expected to occur at various times during the second quarter and third quarter of 2018. These acquisitions are subject to due diligence and other customary closing conditions, and no assurance can be provided that these acquisitions will be completed on the terms described, or at all.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had seven joint venture development properties under construction. The Company anticipates investing a total of $250.0 million related to these projects and had invested $90.8 million of that total as of March 31, 2018. These stores are located in New York (4), Massachusetts (2), and New Jersey. The seven projects are expected to open at various times between the third quarter of 2018 and the fourth quarter of 2019.\nThird-Party Management\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company’s third-party management program included 496 stores totaling 32.5 million square feet. During the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company added 47 stores to its third-party management program.\nSame-Store Results\nThe Company’s same-store portfolio at March 31, 2018 included 458 stores containing approximately 31.6 million rentable square feet, or approximately 93.4% of the aggregate rentable square feet of the Company’s 485 owned stores. These same-store properties represented approximately 95.5% of property net operating income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nSame-store physical occupancy at period end for the first quarter of 2018 was 92.5%, compared with 92.3% for the same quarter of last year. Same-store revenues for the first quarter of 2018 increased 3.8%, and same-store operating expenses increased 3.4% from the same quarter in 2017. Same-store net operating income increased 4.0%, as compared with the same period in 2017.\nOperating Results\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company’s total owned portfolio included 485 stores containing 33.8 million rentable square feet and had a physical occupancy of 90.3%.\nRevenues increased $9.8 million and property operating expenses increased $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, as compared with the same period in 2017. Increases in revenues were primarily attributable to increased net effective rents and occupancy levels in the same-store portfolio as well as revenues generated from property acquisitions and recently opened development properties. Increases in property operating expenses were primarily attributable to a $1.8 million increase in costs associated with growth in our third-party management program as well as system enhancements, a $1.3 million increase in same-store expenses primarily due to higher property taxes and snow removal expenses, and $0.8 million of increased expenses associated with newly acquired or developed stores.\nInterest expense increased from $13.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $15.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $1.6 million. The increase is attributable to a higher amount of outstanding debt and higher interest rates during the 2018 period. To fund a portion of the Company’s growth, the average debt balance during the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased approximately $57 million from the same period in 2017 from $1,624 million to $1,681 million. The weighted average effective interest rate on our outstanding debt increase from 3.71% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 to 3.87% for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nFinancing Activity\nDuring the quarter, the Company did not sell any common shares of beneficial interest through its “at-the-market” equity program (“ATM”). As of March 31, 2018, the Company had 4.7 million shares available for issuance under the existing equity distribution agreements.\nQuarterly Dividend\nOn February 13, 2018, the Company declared a dividend of $0.30 per common share. The dividend was paid on April 16, 2018 to common shareholders of record on April 2, 2018.\n2018 Financial Outlook\n“Based on our first quarter performance, we are increasing the guidance midpoint for certain same-store operating metrics and FFO per share, as adjusted,” commented Chief Financial Officer Tim Martin. “We continue to actively pursue acquisition and development opportunities in targeted markets, selectively purchasing five properties and adding two properties to our value creation pipeline during the quarter. Our investment grade balance sheet is well positioned to support our disciplined growth strategy going forward.”\nThe Company is adjusting its previously issued estimates as well as underlying assumptions, and now expects that its fully diluted FFO per share, as adjusted, for 2018 will be between $1.61 and $1.65 (previously between $1.60 and $1.65), and that its fully diluted earnings per share for the period will be between $0.80 and $0.84 (previously $0.76 and $0.81). Due to uncertainty related to the timing and terms of transactions, the impact of any potential future speculative investment activity is excluded from guidance. For 2018, the same store pool consists of 458 properties totaling 31.6 million square feet.\nCurrent Ranges for 2018 Full Year Guidance Range Summary Annual Assumptions Prior Guidance (1)\nSame-store revenue growth 2.25% to 3.25% 2.0% to 3.0% Same-store expense growth 3.5% to 4.5% 3.5% to 4.5% Same-store NOI growth 1.75% to 3.0% 1.5% to 3.0% Acquisition of wholly-owned operating properties $ 50.0M to $ 100.0M $ 50.0M to $ 100.0M Acquisition of properties at C/O $ 40.0M $ 40.0M $ 20.8M $ 20.8M New development openings $ 135.7M $ 135.7M $ 151.7M $ 151.7M Dispositions $ 0 to $ 50.0M $ 0 to $ 50.0M Dilution from properties in lease-up $ (0.06 ) to $ (0.07 ) $ (0.06 ) to $ (0.07 ) Property management fee income $ 19.0M to $ 21.0M $ 19.0M to $ 21.0M General and administrative expenses $ 36.0M to $ 37.0M $ 36.0M to $ 37.0M Interest and loan amortization expense $ 65.5M to $ 67.5M $ 65.5M to $ 67.5M Weighted average shares and units 185.3M 185.3M 185.3M 185.3M Earnings per diluted share allocated to common shareholders $ 0.80 to $ 0.84 $ 0.76 to $ 0.81 Plus: real estate depreciation and amortization $ 0.81 0.81 $ 0.84 0.84 FFO per diluted share, as adjusted $ 1.61 to $ 1.65 $ 1.60 to $ 1.65 (1) Prior guidance as included in our fourth quarter earnings release dated February 15, 2018.\n2nd Quarter 2018 Guidance Range or Value Earnings per diluted share allocated to common shareholders $ 0.20 to $ 0.21 Plus: real estate depreciation and amortization 0.20 0.20 FFO per diluted share, as adjusted $ 0.40 to $ 0.41 Conference Call\nManagement will host a conference call at 11:00 a.m. ET on Friday, April 27, 2018 to discuss financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nA live webcast of the conference call will be available online from the investor relations page of the Company's corporate website at www.CubeSmart.com .

The Company's self-storage properties are designed to offer affordable, easily accessible and secure storage space for residential and commercial customers. According to the 2018 Self-Storage Almanac, CubeSmart is one of the top three owners and operators of self-storage properties in the United States.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFunds from operations (“FFO”) is a widely used performance measure for real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure of operating performance. The April 2002 National Policy Bulletin of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (the “White Paper”), as amended, defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and related impairment charges, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nManagement uses FFO as a key performance indicator in evaluating the operations of the Company's stores. Given the nature of its business as a real estate owner and operator, the Company considers FFO a key measure of its operating performance that is not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The Company believes that FFO is useful to management and investors as a starting point in measuring its operational performance because FFO excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of its operating performance such as gains (or losses) from sales of real estate, gains from remeasurement of investments in real estate ventures, impairments of depreciable assets, and depreciation, which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult. The Company’s computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies.\nFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of the Company’s performance. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not a measure of liquidity or an indicator of the Company’s ability to make cash distributions. The Company believes that to further understand its performance, FFO should be compared with its reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP, as presented in its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFFO, as adjusted represents FFO as defined above, excluding the effects of acquisition related costs, gains or losses from early extinguishment of debt, and other non-recurring items, which the Company believes are not indicative of the Company’s operating results.\nThe Company defines net operating income, which it refers to as “NOI,” as total continuing revenues less continuing property operating expenses. NOI also can be calculated by adding back to net income (loss): interest expense on loans, loan procurement amortization expense, loan procurement amortization expense – early repayment of debt, acquisition related costs, equity in losses of real estate ventures, other expense, depreciation and amortization expense, general and administrative expense, and deducting from net income (loss): gains from sale of real estate, net, other income, gains from remeasurement of investments in real estate ventures and interest income. NOI is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement uses NOI as a measure of operating performance at each of its stores, and for all of its stores in the aggregate. NOI should not be considered as a substitute for operating income, net income, cash flows provided by operating, investing and financing activities, or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes NOI is useful to investors in evaluating operating performance because it is one of the primary measures used by management and store managers to evaluate the economic productivity of the Company’s stores, including the ability to lease stores, increase pricing and occupancy, and control property operating expenses. Additionally, NOI helps the Company’s investors meaningfully compare the results of its operating performance from period to period by removing the impact of its capital structure (primarily interest expense on outstanding indebtedness) and depreciation of the basis in its assets from operating results.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis presentation, together with other statements and information publicly disseminated by CubeSmart (“we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”), contain certain within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the “Exchange Act.” Forward-looking statements include statements concerning the Company’s plans, objectives, goals, strategies, future events, future revenues or performance, capital expenditures, financing needs, plans or intentions relating to acquisitions and other information that is not historical information.
