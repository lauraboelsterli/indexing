    "text": "DENVER, April 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Simply Good Foods Company (NASDAQ:SMPL) (NASDAQ:SMPL.W) (“Simply Good Foods,” or the “Company”), a developer, marketer and seller of branded nutritional foods and snacking products, today reported financial results for the thirteen and twenty-six week periods ended February 24, 2018.\n“I’m pleased with our fiscal second-quarter results as we continued to build on our marketplace momentum, which resulted in a net sales increase of 6.9%, gross margin expansion and solid operating profit growth,” said Joseph E. Scalzo, President and Chief Executive Officer of The Simply Good Foods Company. “Retail takeaway performance continues to be strong and increased 4.7% and 5.1% for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended February 24, 2018. While early, fiscal third-quarter marketplace performance is off to a good start giving us confidence in our growth initiatives to create value for our shareholders.”\nResults for the Successor Period for the Thirteen Weeks Ended February 24, 2018, and Predecessor Period for the Thirteen Weeks Ended February 25, 2017 (1)\n• Successor net sales were $109.3 million and Predecessor net sales were $102.3 million\n• Successor income tax benefit was $26.8 million and Predecessor income tax expense was $2.1 million\n• Successor net income was $41.4 million and Predecessor net income was $3.5 million\nIn order to present comparable financial information, the Company has also presented supplemental unaudited pro forma financial information for the thirteen weeks ended February 25, 2017, giving effect to the business combination (the “Business Combination”) with Conyers Park Acquisition Corp. (“Conyers Park”) and NCP-ATK Holdings, Inc. (“Atkins”) as if it had occurred on August 28, 2016. All references in this press release section to results for the second quarter ended February 25, 2017, refer to such unaudited pro forma results. The Company believes this pro forma information provides helpful supplemental information with respect to the performance of Simply Good Foods, and particularly the Atkins business, during this period.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights vs. Second Quarter 2017 Pro-Forma\n• Net sales increased 6.9%, or $7.0 million, to $109.3 million\n• Gross profit margin of 46.0%, an increase of 50 basis points\n• Net income increased to $41.4 million, an increase of $35.0 million, benefiting from changes to tax rates and other one-time gains\n• Earnings per diluted share (“EPS”) of $0.56, an increase of $0.47 per fully diluted share\n• Adjusted EBITDA (2) increased 3.9%, to $18.8 million.\n(All comparisons above are with respect to the Predecessor's pro forma thirteen week period ended February 25, 2017)\n(1) On July 7, 2017, the Company completed the Business Combination between Atkins and Conyers Park, and as a result of the Business Combination, both Conyers Park and Atkins became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Simply Good Foods. Pursuant to GAAP and SEC requirements and the application of acquisition accounting, the Company's consolidated financial results are presented: (i) as of and for the thirteen weeks ended February 24, 2018 (Successor); and (ii) as of and for the thirteen weeks ended February 25, 2017 (Predecessor). All references to “Successor” refers to Simply Good Foods, and all references to “Predecessor” refers to Atkins prior to the Business Combination.\n(2) Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Please refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measure and Related Information” and “Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA” in this press release for an explanation and reconciliations of this non-GAAP financial measure.\nNet sales increased $7.0 million, or 6.9%, to $109.3 million driven by organic sales growth of 5.8%, and the acquisition of Wellness Foods, Inc., and its Simply Protein brand, which added a 1.1% increase to net sales.\nGross profit was $50.3 million for the second quarter of 2018, an increase of $3.7 million or 7.9%. Gross profit margin was 46.0% compared to 45.5% for the pro forma thirteen weeks ended February 25, 2017 due to a reduction in supply chain costs.\nNet income increased $35.0 million, to $41.4 million primarily due to a one-time gain related to the re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities of $29.0 million, a $4.7 million gain in the fair value of the Tax Receivable Agreement, as well as improvement in gross profit. This was partially offset by slightly higher distribution costs and $1.9 million in business transaction costs related to the secondary offering in February and acquisition due diligence costs. Additionally, as planned, selling expense increased driven by higher levels of in-store advertising and on-line marketing investment, and a 5.0% increase in general and administrative expenses as a result of public company costs.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure used by the Company that makes certain adjustments to net income calculated under GAAP, increased 3.9% to $18.8 million.\n(All comparisons above are with respect to the Predecessor's pro forma thirteen week period ended February 25, 2017)\nResults for the Successor Period for the Twenty-Six Weeks Ended February 24, 2018, and Predecessor Period for the Twenty-Six Weeks Ended February 25, 2017 (3)\n• Successor net sales were $215.9 million and Predecessor net sales were $202.1 million\n• Successor income tax benefit was $20.3 million and Predecessor income tax expense was $7.0 million\n• Successor net income was $51.6 million and Predecessor net income was $10.3 million\nIn order to present comparable financial information, the Company has also presented supplemental unaudited pro forma financial information for the twenty-six weeks ended February 25, 2017, giving effect to the business combination (the “Business Combination”) with Conyers Park Acquisition Corp. (“Conyers Park”) and NCP-ATK Holdings, Inc. (“Atkins”) as if it had occurred on August 28, 2016. All references in this press release section to results for the twenty-six weeks ended February 25, 2017, refer to such unaudited pro forma results. The Company believes this pro forma information provides helpful supplemental information with respect to the performance of Simply Good Foods, and particularly the Atkins business, during this period.\nYear-to-Date Second Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights vs. Year-to-Date Second Quarter 2017 Pro-Forma\n• Net sales increased 6.8%, or $13.8 million, to $215.9 million\n• Gross profit margin of 47.7%, an increase of 60 basis points\n• Net income increased to $51.6 million, an increase of $36.1 million, benefiting from changes to tax rates and other one-time gains\n• Earnings per diluted share (“EPS”) of $0.71, an increase of $0.50 per fully diluted share\n• Adjusted EBITDA increased 5.3%, to $42.5 million.\n(All comparisons above are with respect to the Predecessor's pro forma twenty-six week second quarter ended February 25, 2017)\n(3) On July 7, 2017, the Company completed the Business Combination between Atkins and Conyers Park, and as a result of the Business Combination, both Conyers Park and Atkins became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Simply Good Foods. Pursuant to GAAP and SEC requirements and the application of acquisition accounting, the Company's consolidated financial results are presented: (i) as of and for the twenty-six weeks ended February 24, 2018 (Successor); and (ii) as of and for the twenty-six weeks ended February 25, 2017 (Predecessor). All references to “Successor” refers to Simply Good Foods, and all references to “Predecessor” refers to Atkins prior to the Business Combination.\nNet sales increased $13.8 million, or 6.8%, to $215.9 million driven by organic sales growth of 4.9%, and the acquisition of Wellness Foods, Inc., and its Simply Protein brand, which added a 1.9% increase to net sales.\nGross profit was $103.0 million for the twenty-six weeks ended February 24, 2018, an increase of $7.7 million or 8.1%. Gross profit margin was 47.7% compared to 47.1% for the pro forma thirteen weeks ended February 25, 2017 due to a reduction in supply chain costs and favorable product mix.\nNet income increased $36.1 million to $51.6 million primarily due to a one-time gain related to the re-measurement of deferred tax liabilities of $29.0 million, a $4.7 million gain in the fair value of the Tax Receivable Agreement, as well as improvement in gross profit. This was partially offset by slightly higher distribution costs and $1.9 million in business transaction costs related to the secondary offering in February and acquisition due diligence costs, a 7.3% increase in selling expense, and a 10.8% increase in general and administrative expenses as a result of public company costs and the addition of Wellness Foods acquired in December 2016.\nAdjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure used by the Company that makes certain adjustments to net income calculated under GAAP, increased 5.3% to $42.5 million.\n(All comparisons above are with respect to the Predecessor's pro forma twenty-six week period ended February 25, 2017)\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nAs of February 24, 2018, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $79.0 million and $199.5 million in outstanding principal of the term loan, resulting in a trailing twelve month pro forma combined Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.6x. The Company also has a $75.0 million revolving line of credit available for borrowing which is not currently being utilized, with no borrowings outstanding as of February 24, 2018.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law. The change in the tax law is partially effective in our current 2018 fiscal year and will be fully effective in our 2019 fiscal year. The Tax Act, among other things, reduces the top U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings.\nDue to the complexities involved in accounting for the Tax Act, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Staff Accounting Bulletin (\"SAB\") 118 requires that the Company include in its financial statements the reasonable estimate of the impact of the Tax Act on earnings to the extent such reasonable estimate has been determined. The Company is allowed a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. As of February 24, 2018, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Act; however, as described below, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. In other cases, we have not been able to make a reasonable estimate and continue to account for those items based on our existing accounting under ASC 740, Income Taxes , and the provisions of the tax laws that were in effect immediately prior to enactment. For the items for which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate, we recognized a provisional gain of $29.0 million, which is included as a component of Income tax (benefit) expense in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. While our Tax Act assessment is provisional, we do not anticipate material changes.\nThe Tax Act reduces the corporate federal tax rate to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As of February 24, 2018, we have recorded a provisional decrease to our deferred tax liabilities, with a corresponding net adjustment to deferred income tax benefit of $29.0 million. While we are able to make a reasonable estimate of the impact of the reduction in corporate rate, it may be affected by other analyses related to the Tax Act, including, but not limited to, our calculation of deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income and the state tax effect of adjustments made to federal temporary differences.\nOutlook\nSimply Good Foods reaffirms its net sales outlook for fiscal year 2018, and expects it to increase within its previously stated long-term target of 4% to 6% growth. The recently passed Tax Act will have a favorable impact on net income, earnings per share-diluted and cash flow. The Company will re-invest a portion of this benefit in:\n• Incremental strategic investments in marketing and brand building initiatives to drive growth that will enable the Company to finish the year strong and ensure marketplace momentum continues into fiscal 2019;\n• Investment in organizational capabilities in key functions and process that positions the Company for further growth and future compliance requirements; and\n• A $1,000 bonus for all employees below the director level.\nCombined with the previously mentioned public company expense of $2.0 million, the Company expects Adjusted EBITDA growth rate to be slightly lower than net sales growth rate in fiscal 2018.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nThe Company will host a conference call with members of the executive management team to discuss these results today, Tuesday, April 10, 2018 at 6:30 a.m. Mountain time (8:30 a.m. Eastern time).

The unaudited pro forma income statement presents the historical consolidated statement of operations of Atkins for the thirteen weeks ended February 25, 2017, giving effect to the Business Combination as if it had occurred on August 28, 2016.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial statements give effect to the Business Combination in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The historical financial information has been adjusted to give pro forma effect to events that are related and/or directly attributable to the Business Combination, are factually supportable and are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of the combined company. The adjustments presented on the unaudited pro forma financial statements have been identified and presented to provide relevant information necessary for an accurate understanding of the combined company upon consummation of the Business Combination.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information is for illustrative purposes only. The financial results may have been different if the Business Combination actually been completed sooner. You should not rely on the unaudited pro forma financial information as being indicative of the historical results that would have been achieved if the Business Combination been completed as of the beginning of fiscal 2017.\nUnaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations\nFor the Pro Forma Thirteen Week Period Ended February 25, 2017\n(In thousands)\nUnaudited Historical (i) Pro Forma (Predecessor) Unaudited Thirteen Weeks Ended Pro Forma\nAdjustments Thirteen Weeks Ended (in thousands) February 25, 2017 February 25, 2017 Net sales $ 102,308 $ — $ 102,308 Cost of goods sold 55,735 — 55,735 Gross profit 46,573 — 46,573 Operating Expenses: Distribution 4,960 — 4,960 Selling 3,978 — 3,978 Marketing 10,030 — 10,030 General and administrative 11,768 335 ii 12,103 Depreciation and amortization 2,474 (560 ) iii 1,914 Other expense 58 — 58 Total operating expenses 33,268 (225 ) 33,043 Income from operations 13,305 225 13,530 Other income (expense): Change in warrant liabilities (1,119 ) 1,119 iv — Interest expense (6,566 ) 3,709 v (2,857 ) Gain (loss) on foreign currency transactions (108 ) — (108 ) Other income 22 — 22 Total other expense (7,771 ) 4,828 (2,943 ) Income before income taxes 5,534 5,053 10,587 Income tax (benefit) or expense 2,071 2,121 vi 4,192 Net income $ 3,463 $ 2,932 $ 6,395 Other Financial Data (Unaudited): Adjusted EBITDA (vii) $ 18,109 $ 18,109\ni. The amounts presented represent the Predecessor’s historical GAAP results of operations. ii. The adjustment represents the incremental stock-based compensation expense under the new Simply Good Foods omnibus incentive plan. iii. The adjustment reflects the difference in the intangible asset amortization expense associated with the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets due to the Business Combination. The amortization expense decreased as more indefinite lived intangible assets were identified for the successor entity than the predecessor entity. The amount of amortizable intangible assets identified in the Business Combination decreased from $125.8 million to $88.0 million. iv. Simply Good Foods warrants are not liabilities and are accounted for as equity warrants. To make the periods comparable the adjustment represents the corresponding reversal of the predecessor fair value adjustment of expense. v. The adjustment represents the expected interest expense associated with the term loan and revolving debt facilities of Simply Good Foods. The predecessor entity had $337.2 million outstanding as of August 27, 2016 while the successor entity had $200.0 million outstanding. The long-term debt of the predecessor entity accrued interest at 6.25% on the first lien and 9.75% on the second lien while the successor debt accrues interest at 3 month LIBOR and 4%. The significant reduction in outstanding principal, and lower interest rates, drive significant expense savings. vi. Represents the effective income tax rate of 39.6% vii. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. For a reconciliation to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, see “Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA” below. Comparison of Unaudited Results for the Thirteen Week Period Ended February 24, 2018 and the Supplemental Pro Forma Thirteen Week Period Ended February 25, 2017\nFor comparative purposes, we are presenting an unaudited statement of operations for the thirteen week period ended February 24, 2018, compared to unaudited supplemental pro forma statement of operations for the thirteen week period ended February 25, 2017. The following table presents, for the periods indicated, selected information from our supplemented unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial results, including information presented as a percentage of net sales:\nHistorical Pro Forma Successor Predecessor unaudited unaudited 13-weeks ended 13-weeks ended (in thousands) February 24, 2018 % of sales February 25, 2017 % of sales Net sales $ 109,347 100.0 % $ 102,308 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 59,090 54.0 % 55,735 54.5 % Gross profit 50,257 46.0 % 46,573 45.5 % Operating Expenses: Distribution 5,391 4.9 % 4,960 4.8 % Selling 4,975 4.5 % 3,978 3.9 % Marketing 10,056 9.2 % 10,030 9.8 % General and administrative 12,711 11.6 % 12,103 11.8 % Depreciation and amortization 1,948 1.8 % 1,914 1.9 % Business transaction costs\n1,877 1.7 % — — % Gain in fair value change of contingent consideration - TRA liability (3,668 ) (3.4 )% — — % Other Expense 184 0.2 % 58 0.1 % Total operating expenses 33,474 30.6 % 33,043 32.3 % Income from operations 16,783 15.3 % 13,530 13.2 % Other income (expense): Changes in warrant liabilities — — % — — % Interest expense (3,093 ) (2.8 )% (2,857 ) (2.8 )% Gain (loss) on foreign currency transactions 601 0.5 % (108 ) (0.1 )% Other income 312 0.3 % 22 — % Total other expense (2,180 ) (2.0 )% (2,943 ) (2.9 )% Income before income taxes 14,603 13.4 % 10,587 10.3 % Income tax (benefit) expense (26,791 ) (24.5 )% 4,192 4.1 % Net income $ 41,394 37.9 % $ 6,395 6.3 % Earnings per share from net income: Basic $ 0.59 $ 0.09 Diluted $ 0.56 $ 0.09 Weighted average shares outstanding: (i) Basic 70,582,573 70,582,573 Diluted 73,832,207 73,832,207 i. For comparability purposes the historical financial information has been adjusted to give pro forma effect to events that are related and/or directly attributable to the Business Combination. The Company has assumed the pro forma weighted average shares outstanding of the predecessor to be the same as the comparable period of the successor as the pro forma results of the predecessor is adjusted for the incremental difference in stock-based compensation and the treatment of the warrant liabilities. Prior to the Business Combination the predecessor had 508,219 shares of Common Stock outstanding. Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Twenty-Six Week Period Ended February 25, 2017\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared from the perspective of Atkins and for the twenty-six weeks ended February 25, 2017. The unaudited pro forma income statement presents the historical consolidated statement of operations of Atkins for the twenty-six weeks ended February 25, 2017, giving effect to the Business Combination as if it had occurred on August 28, 2016.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial statements give effect to the Business Combination in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. The historical financial information has been adjusted to give pro forma effect to events that are related and/or directly attributable to the Business Combination, are factually supportable and are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of the combined company. The adjustments presented on the unaudited pro forma financial statements have been identified and presented to provide relevant information necessary for an accurate understanding of the combined company upon consummation of the Business Combination.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information is for illustrative purposes only. The financial results may have been different if the Business Combination actually been completed sooner. You should not rely on the unaudited pro forma financial information as being indicative of the historical results that would have been achieved if the Business Combination been completed as of the beginning of fiscal 2017.\nUnaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations\nFor the Pro Forma Twenty-Six Week Period Ended February 25, 2017\n(In thousands)\nUnaudited Historical (i) Pro Forma (Predecessor) Unaudited 26-weeks ended Pro Forma\nAdjustments 26-weeks ended (in thousands) February 25, 2017 February 25, 2017 Net sales $ 202,111 $ — $ 202,111 Cost of goods sold 106,826 — 106,826 Gross profit 95,285 — 95,285 Operating Expenses: Distribution 9,329 — 9,329 Selling 8,271 — 8,271 Marketing 19,236 — 19,236 General and administrative 21,699 681 ii 22,380 Depreciation and amortization 4,927 (1,121 ) iii 3,806 Other expense 58 — 58 Total operating expenses 63,520 (440 ) 63,080 Income from operations 31,765 440 32,205 Other income (expense): Change in warrant liabilities (397 ) 397 iv — Interest expense (13,629 ) 7,674 v (5,955 ) Gain (loss) on foreign currency transactions (718 ) — (718 ) Other income 199 — 199 Total other expense (14,545 ) 8,071 (6,474 ) Income before income taxes 17,220 8,511 25,731 Income tax (benefit) or expense 6,970 3,219 vi 10,189 Net income $ 10,250 $ 5,292 $ 15,542 Other Financial Data (Unaudited): Adjusted EBITDA (ix) $ 40,360 $ 40,360\ni. The amounts presented represent the Predecessor’s historical GAAP results of operations. ii. The adjustment represents the incremental stock-based compensation expense under the new Simply Good Foods omnibus incentive plan. iii. The adjustment reflects the difference in the intangible asset amortization expense associated with the allocation of purchase price to intangible assets due to the Business Combination. The amortization expense decreased as more indefinite lived intangible assets were identified for the successor entity than the predecessor entity. The amount of amortizable intangible assets identified in the Business Combination decreased from $125.8 million to $88.0 million. iv. Simply Good Foods warrants are not liabilities and are accounted for as equity warrants. To make the periods comparable the adjustment represents the corresponding reversal of the predecessor fair value adjustment of expense. v. The adjustment represents the expected interest expense associated with the term loan and revolving debt facilities of Simply Good Foods. The predecessor entity had $337.2 million outstanding as of August 27, 2016 while the successor entity had $200.0 million outstanding. The long-term debt of the predecessor entity accrued interest at 6.25% on the first lien and 9.75% on the second lien while the successor debt accrues interest at 3 month LIBOR and 4%. The significant reduction in outstanding principal, and lower interest rates, drive significant expense savings. vi. Represents the effective income tax rate of 39.6% vii.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net income as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (each as determined in accordance with GAAP). Simply Good Foods defines Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) as net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization with further adjustments to exclude the following items: stock-based compensation and warrant expense, transaction costs and IPO readiness costs, restructuring costs, management fees, frozen media licensing fees, transactional exchange impact, change in fair value of contingent consideration - TRA liability, business transaction costs, and other non-core expenses . The Company believes that the inclusion of these supplementary adjustments in presenting Adjusted EBITDA are appropriate to provide additional information to investors and reflects more accurately operating results of the on-going operations . Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to differences in calculation.\nThe following unaudited tables below provides a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income (loss), for the thirteen week periods ended February 24, 2018 (Successor), February 25, 2017 (Predecessor), and pro forma period ended February 25, 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA Reconciliation:\n(in thousands) Thirteen Weeks\nEnded Thirteen Weeks\nEnded Thirteen Weeks\nEnded February 24, 2018 February 25, 2017 February 25, 2017 (Successor) (Predecessor) (Pro Forma) Net income $ 41,394 $ 3,463 $ 6,395 Interest 3,093 6,566 2,857 Taxes Expense (Gain) (26,791 ) 2,071 4,192 Depreciation/Amortization 1,948 2,474 1,914 EBITDA 19,644 14,574 15,358 Business transaction costs 1,877 — — Stock-based compensation and warrant expense 899 1,656 872 Transaction Fees / IPO Readiness — 548 548 Restructuring 184 57 57 Roark Management Fee — 551 551 Frozen Licensing Media 62 335 335 Non-core legal costs 403 272 272 Gain in fair value change of contingent consideration - TRA liability (3,668 ) — — Other (1) (594 ) 116 116 Adjusted EBITDA $ 18,807 $ 18,109 $ 18,109\n(1) Other items consist principally of exchange impact of foreign currency transactions as well as minor impacts of channel inventory returns\nThe following unaudited tables below provides a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income (loss), for the twenty-six week periods ended February 24, 2018 (Successor), February 25, 2017 (Predecessor), and pro forma period ended February 25, 2017.\nAdjusted EBITDA Reconciliation:\n(in thousands) Twenty-Six Weeks\nEnded Twenty-Six Weeks\nEnded Twenty-Six Weeks\nEnded February 24, 2018 February 25, 2017 February 25, 2017 (Successor) (Predecessor) (Pro Forma) Net income $ 51,612 $ 10,250 $ 15,542 Interest 6,112 13,629 5,955 Taxes Expense (Gain) (20,301 ) 6,970 10,189 Depreciation/Amortization 3,882 4,927 3,806 EBITDA 41,305 35,776 35,492 Business transaction costs 1,877 — — Stock-based compensation and warrant expense 1,967 1,460 1,744 Transaction Fees / IPO Readiness — 556 556 Restructuring 430 57 57 Roark Management Fee — 981 981 Frozen Licensing Media 125 335 335 Non-core legal costs 779 455 455 Gain in fair value change of contingent consideration - TRA liability (3,026 ) — — Other (1) (940 ) 740 740 Adjusted EBITDA $ 42,517 $ 40,360 $ 40,360",
