    "text": "ZAGREB (Reuters) - The Croatian parliament began on Thursday to debate an opposition no-confidence motion against Deputy Prime Minister Martina Dalic over her handling of a debt crisis that hit Croatia’s largest firm Agrokor.\nFILE PHOTO: Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic (C) speaks to media next to Finance Minister Zdravko Maric (R) and Economy Minister Martina Dalic in Zagreb, May 4, 2017. REUTERS/Antonio Bronic/File Photo The opposition says that Dalic, who is also the economy minister, should have exercised tighter control over those hired to stave off bankruptcy at the food concern.\nFormer Agrokor crisis manager Ante Ramljak stepped down in February after the government voiced discontent over the hiring of his former employer as a consultant on a restructuring programme - potentially setting up a conflict of interest.\nDalic and the government rejected the opposition’s accusations, saying the debt crunch had been handled successfully and that they could not have known all guidelines regarding the hiring of consultants.\nEarlier this week Agrokor said its creditors had reached agreement on a settlement deal which includes a debt-for-equity swap, a certain level of write-offs and sustainable debt for the new Agrokor holding.\nThe ruling conservative-led coalition has a narrow parliamentary majority of 77 in the 151-seat parliament.\nGovernment officials voiced confidence that the opposition, led by the Social Democrats and centre-right Most (“Bridge”) party, would be unable to muster the 76 votes needed to remove Dalic and destabilise the Zagreb government.\nThe no-confidence vote is expected to take place on Friday.\nReporting by Igor Ilic; Editing by Mark Heinrich\n ",
