    "text": "By Polina Marinova 9:18 AM EDT IPO AVALANCHE\nGood morning, Term Sheet readers.\nI‚Äôm back! Huge thanks to my wonderful colleagues Lucinda Shen, Andrew Nusca, Robert Hackett, and Jen Wieczner who pitched in last week. It takes a village.\nOn to the news.\nEYE-POPPING IPO: Is Spotify about to be one-upped? China streaming giant Tencent Music is getting ready for what would be one of the largest tech IPOs ever. Tencent Music Entertainment Group is the digital music arm of Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings. The company plans to interview potential underwriting banks in the next month, and Tencent Music is expected to list in the U.S.\nTencent Music‚Äôs offering could value the business at more than $25 billion, according to The Wall Street Journal . This is a steep increase from the company‚Äôs last valuation in 2017 of $12.5 billion. The new valuation would make it the fourth-biggest U.S.-listed tech IPO on record. (Interesting side note: Tencent and Music swapped stakes in each other‚Äôs companies late last year in a deal that valued Tencent Music at $12.5 billion and Spotify at $20 billion.)\nBut here is one question weighing on everyone‚Äôs mind: Just how big is Tencent Music‚Äôs addressable market? Here‚Äôs some sharp analysis from the WSJ :\nChina‚Äôs entire music industry generated $480 million in revenue from live and recorded music in 2016, PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates, a small-sounding figure thanks to years of rampant piracy: later data aren‚Äôt yet available. Sure, that $480 million represented 13% growth from the prior year. Growth could stay healthy, and a government clampdown on pirated music may start working. But the market could still only make nearly $900 million in revenue by 2021, PwC reckons.\nThe U.S. market is worth about $8.7 billion, according to the Recording Industry Association of America. In other words, Tencent Music‚Äôs apparent valuation is already several multiples of the whole Chinese music market. Remember, too, that less than 10% of its current users now are paid subscribers, paying about $2 a month. Much will depend, then, on how it plans to change that ratio or generate revenue from other sources, such as advertising.‚Äù\nTERM SHEET SURVEY RESULTS: Last month, I asked you to fill out a survey to tell me what you think about this newsletter: what you like (and don‚Äôt), what you want to see more of, and what you think we‚Äôre missing. I just got the results, and I wanted to share them with you in full transparency.\nWhat you like:\n‚Ä¢ The deals section is comprehensive and thorough.\n‚Ä¢ The commentary at the top is timely, concise, and informative.\n‚Ä¢ Term Sheet‚Äôs tone is conversational and to the point.\nWhat you don‚Äôt like:\n‚Ä¢ The opening section is sometimes too long ‚Äî would like to see it drilled down and simplified.\n‚Ä¢ Too venture/tech/Silicon Valley focused. Would be more interested in late-stage buyouts.\n‚Ä¢ Interviews with VCs are usually focused on big names. Would like to see more up-and-coming VCs featured.\nI take this feedback seriously, and you can expect to see more of your suggestions implemented. Here‚Äôs the one stat that made me beam ‚Äî 98% of you said that you consider this newsletter extremely/very valuable. üôå I‚Äôd love to keep this number high, so as always, keep the feedback coming.\nAdvertisement THE LATEST FROM FORTUNE...\n‚Ä¢ How Nick Saban Keeps Alabama Football Rolling (by Brian O‚ÄôKeefe)\n‚Ä¢ Sheryl Sandberg Talks Paid Family Leave, Community Organizing, and Cambridge Analytica (by Valentina Zarya)\n‚Ä¢ Michael Bloomberg Is Footing $4.5 Million of the U.S.‚Äôs Paris Agreement Bill (by Hallie Detrick)\n‚Ä¢ Your Next Home Could Be 3-D Printed (by Chris Morris)\n‚Ä¶AND ELSEWHERE\nPivotal Software closed up 5% following IPO and raised $555 million .
