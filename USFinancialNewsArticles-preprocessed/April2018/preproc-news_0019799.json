    "text": "April 11, 2018 / 3:53 AM / Updated 34 minutes ago Jagielka sees Everton attack benefiting from solid defence Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Everton captain Phil Jagielka believes improved performances from the defence can help give the Merseyside club’s attackers greater freedom to express themselves in front of goal. Soccer Football - Premier League - Everton vs Brighton & Hove Albion - Goodison Park, Liverpool, Britain - March 10, 2018 Everton's Phil Jagielka gestures Action Images via Reuters/Craig Brough \nLast weekend’s 0-0 draw with local rivals Liverpool marked a second clean sheet in four Premier League games and centre-back Jagielka believes that sort of solidity is key to the creation of match-winning goals for the forwards. \n\"Clean sheets are the foundation you build from,\" Jagielka told Everton's website www.evertonfc.com . \n“You want to give your striker the chance to be the match winner. If we can keep it tight at the back, hopefully the forwards will get one or two chances in a game and take them, so the clean sheet is always important. \n“Confidence works both ways... “ \nEverton, who are ninth in the standings, will be gunning for back-to-back away victories for the first time this season when they travel to 15th-placed Swansea City on Saturday.
