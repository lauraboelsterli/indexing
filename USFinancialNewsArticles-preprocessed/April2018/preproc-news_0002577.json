Genprex's platform technologies are designed to administer cancer fighting genes by encapsulating them into nanoscale hollow spheres called nanovesicles, which are then administered intravenously and taken up by tumor cells where they express proteins that are missing or found in low quantities. Oncoprex has a multimodal mechanism of action whereby it interrupts cell signaling pathways that cause replication and proliferation of cancer cells, re-establishes pathways for apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in cancer cells, and modulates the immune response against cancer cells. Oncoprex has also been shown to block mechanisms that create drug resistance.\nContact:\nInvestors:\nStephanie Carrington\nICR Healthcare\n646-277-1282\nStephanie.Carrington@icrinc.com\nMedia:\nJames Heins\nICR Healthcare\n203-682-8251\nJames.Heins@icrinc.com\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/genprex-announces-closing-of-initial-public-offering-300623968.html\nSOURCE Genprex, Inc.",
