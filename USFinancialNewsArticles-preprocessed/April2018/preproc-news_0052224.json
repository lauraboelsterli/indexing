    "text": "RICHMOND, Va., April 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Dominion Energy Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE: DM), reported unaudited net income attributable to the partnership of $57.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) were $79.5 million for the first-quarter, and distributable cash flow was $52.1 million for the quarter. The distribution coverage ratio was 1.23 times at the end of the first-quarter.\nDominion Energy Midstream uses Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow as the primary performance measurements of its earnings and results for public communications with analysts and investors. Dominion Energy Midstream also uses Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow internally for budgeting, reporting to the Board of Directors and other purposes. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow provide a more meaningful representation of the partnership's financial performance and liquidity. Schedules B and D of this press release include reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nAs a result of the disruption in Master Limited Partnership (MLP) capital markets subsequent to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's March 15, 2018 policy revision related to ratemaking for natural gas pipelines owned by MLPs, Dominion Energy:\nIntends to recommend 5 percent quarterly increases in distributions to limited partners subject to maintaining an approximately 1.0 times coverage ratio; Plans to recommend a restructuring of Dominion Energy Midstream's incentive distribution rights in advance of any future DM equity issuances; and Plans to retain Cove Point at Dominion Energy through 2018 as compared to previous plans to contribute a portion of Cove Point to Dominion Energy Midstream during the second half of 2018.\nQUARTERLY DISTRIBUTION\nOn April 20, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.3340 per common and subordinated unit, payable on May 15, 2018, to such unitholders of record at the close of business May 4, 2018. This distribution represents a 5 percent increase over the fourth-quarter 2017 distribution.\nCONFERENCE CALL TODAY\nDominion Energy Midstream and Dominion Energy will jointly host a first-quarter earnings conference call at 10 a.m. ET on Friday, April 27, 2018.
