    "text": "LUXEMBOURG, April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. (“Altisource” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:ASPS) today reported financial results for the first quarter 2018.\nFirst quarter service revenue of $188.8 million represents 22% of the midpoint of the Company’s 2018 service revenue scenarios. First quarter service revenue was lower than first quarter 2017 service revenue of $229.8 million primarily from the normal runoff of the Ocwen Financial Corporation (“Ocwen”) servicing portfolio and RESI’s smaller portfolio of non-performing loans and REO. These declines were partially offset by non-Ocwen service revenue growth in the field services, Hubzu ® , renovation management, fulfillment and Owners.com businesses.\nFirst quarter net loss attributable to Altisource was $(4.1) million and adjusted net income attributable to Altisource (1) was $8.6 million. The net loss attributable to Altisource includes a mark-to-market loss of $7.5 million ($5.6 million after tax) on Altisource’s investment in the common stock of Front Yard Residential Corporation (“RESI”). Effective January 1, 2018, accounting standards require that changes in the fair value of Altisource’s investment in the common stock of RESI be included in net income. In prior periods, changes in the fair value of this investment were reflected in other comprehensive income and equity.\nFirst quarter diluted loss per share was $(0.24) and adjusted diluted earnings per share (1) was $0.48, representing 24% of the midpoint of the Company’s 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share scenarios (2) . First quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share was lower than $0.71 in the first quarter of 2017 primarily from lower service revenue, partially offset by cost reduction initiatives.\n“Our results of operations are in line with our expectations for the seasonally slower first quarter. The strong momentum of our recent client wins, with first quarter notifications from nine Servicer Solutions and Origination Solutions prospects that we’ve won their business, and our robust sales pipeline positions us to accelerate our non-Ocwen sales growth as the year progresses,” said Chief Executive Officer William B. Shepro.\nMr. Shepro further commented, “I am also very pleased with several recent developments at Altisource. We improved our liquidity profile with the refinancing of our senior secured term loan, extending the maturity date from December 2020 to April 2024. We received notification from the CFPB that it has completed its investigation, is currently not recommending an enforcement action and relieved us of our document retention obligations pursuant to the civil investigative process. Finally, we are positioned to benefit from Ocwen’s announced agreement to acquire PHH Corporation (“PHH”) which significantly increases the size of Ocwen’s servicing portfolio and should position Ocwen for further growth.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights (3)\nCorporate\nRefinanced our Senior Secured Term Loan (“SSTL”) on April 3, 2018, extending the maturity from December 2020 to April 2024.

We believe these measures are useful to management, existing shareholders, potential shareholders and other users of our financial information in evaluating operating profitability and cash flow generation more on the basis of continuing cost and cash flows as they exclude amortization expense related to acquisitions that occurred in prior periods and non-cash share-based compensation, as well as the effect of more significant non-recurring items from earnings and cash flows from operating activities. We believe these measures are also useful in evaluating the effectiveness of our operations and underlying business trends in a manner that is consistent with management’s evaluation of business performance. Furthermore, we believe the exclusion of more significant non-recurring items enables comparability to prior period performance and trend analysis.\nIt is management’s intent to provide non-GAAP financial information to enhance the understanding of Altisource’s GAAP financial information, and it should be considered by the reader in addition to, but not instead of, the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Each non-GAAP financial measure is presented along with the corresponding GAAP measure so as not to imply that more emphasis should be placed on the non-GAAP measure. The non-GAAP financial information presented may be determined or calculated differently by other companies. The non-GAAP financial information should not be unduly relied upon.\nPretax (loss) income attributable to Altisource is calculated by removing non-controlling interests from (loss) income before income taxes and non-controlling interests. Adjusted pretax income attributable to Altisource is calculated by removing intangible asset amortization expense, share-based compensation expense, unrealized loss on investment in equity securities and non-controlling interests from (loss) income before income taxes and non-controlling interests. Adjusted net income attributable to Altisource is calculated by removing intangible asset amortization expense (net of tax), share-based compensation (net of tax), certain income tax related items relating to the Luxembourg subsidiary merger, other income tax rate changes in Luxembourg and the United States and an increase in foreign income tax reserves (and related interest) and unrealized loss on investment in equity securities (net of tax) from net (loss) income attributable to Altisource. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net (loss) income attributable to Altisource after removing intangible asset amortization expense (net of tax), share-based compensation (net of tax), certain income tax related items described above and unrealized loss on investment in equity securities (net of tax) by the weighted average number of diluted shares. Adjusted cash flows from operating activities less additions to premises and equipment is calculated by removing the cash payment related to the net litigation settlement loss and the increase in short-term investments in real estate and additions to premises and equipment from, cash flows from operating activities.\nReconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the corresponding GAAP measures are as follows:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, Three months\nended\nDecember 31, 2018 2017 2017 Income (loss) before income taxes and non-controlling interests $ (4,972 ) $ 9,746 $ 3,112 Non-controlling interests (525 ) (615 ) (633 ) Pretax (loss) income attributable to Altisource (5,497 ) 9,131 2,479 Intangible asset amortization expense 7,147 9,146 8,224 Share-based compensation expense 2,201 695 1,018 Unrealized loss on investment in equity securities 7,501 — — Adjusted pretax income attributable to Altisource $ 11,352 $ 18,972 $ 11,721 Net (loss) income attributable to Altisource $ (4,132 ) $ 6,545 $ 286,350 Intangible asset amortization expense, net of tax 5,491 6,720 7,597 Share-based compensation expense, net of tax 1,691 511 940 Certain income tax related items, net — — (284,108 ) Unrealized loss on investment in equity securities, net of tax 5,551 — — Adjusted net income attributable to Altisource $ 8,601 $ 13,776 $ 10,779 Diluted (loss) earnings per share $ (0.24 ) $ 0.34 $ 15.72 Impact of using diluted share count instead of basic share count for a loss per share 0.01 — — Intangible asset amortization expense, net of tax, per diluted share 0.31 0.35 0.42 Share-based compensation expense, net of tax, per diluted share 0.09 0.03 0.05 Certain income tax related items, net, per diluted share — — (15.60 ) Unrealized loss on investment in equity securities, net of tax, per diluted share 0.31 — — Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 0.48 $ 0.71 $ 0.59 Calculation of the impact of intangible asset amortization expense, net of tax Intangible asset amortization expense $ 7,147 $ 9,146 $ 8,224 Tax benefit from intangible asset amortization (1,656 ) (2,426 ) (627 ) Intangible asset amortization expense, net of tax 5,491 6,720 7,597 Diluted share count 17,881 19,304 18,211 Intangible asset amortization expense, net of tax, per diluted share $ 0.31 $ 0.35 $ 0.42 Calculation of the impact of share-based compensation expense, net of tax Share-based compensation expense $ 2,201 $ 695 $ 1,018 Tax benefit from share-based compensation expense (510 ) (184 ) (78 ) Share-based compensation expense, net of tax 1,691 511 940 Diluted share count 17,881 19,304 18,211 Share-based compensation expense, net of tax, per diluted share $ 0.09 $ 0.03 $ 0.05 Certain income tax related items, net, resulting from: Luxembourg subsidiaries merger, net $ — $ — $ (300,908 ) Other income tax rate changes — — 6,270 Foreign income tax reserves — — 10,530 Certain income tax related items, net — — (284,108 ) Diluted share count 17,881 19,304 18,211 Certain income tax related items, net, per diluted share $ — $ — $ (15.60 ) Calculation of the impact of the unrealized loss on investment in equity securities, net of tax Unrealized loss on investment in equity securities $ 7,501 $ — $ — Tax benefit from the unrealized loss on investment in equity securities (1,950 ) — — Unrealized loss on investment in equity securities, net of tax 5,551 — — Diluted share count 17,881 19,304 18,211 Unrealized loss on investment in equity securities, net of tax per diluted share $ 0.31 $ — $ — Cash flows from operating activities $ (8,569 ) $ (18,359 ) $ 18,953 Net litigation settlement loss payment — 28,000 — Increase in short-term investments in real estate 9,915 2,507 4,761 Adjusted cash flows from operating activities 1,346 12,148 23,714 Less: Additions to premises and equipment (1,258 ) (1,944 ) (3,029 ) Adjusted cash flows from operating activities less additions to premises and equipment $ 88 $ 10,204 $ 20,685",
