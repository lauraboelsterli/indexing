We continued to see strong demand for our business from existing BPO clients as well as new clients during the six months ended December 31, 2017.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenues consists primarily of salaries, payroll taxes and employee benefits costs of our customer service associates and other operations personnel. Cost of revenues also includes direct communications costs, rent expense, information technology costs, and facilities support. Cost of revenues increased by $12.1 million, or 42.3%, to $40.8 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017 from $28.7 million for the same period of the prior year. As a percentage of revenues, cost of revenues was 75.2% for the six months ended December 31, 2017, compared to 74.9% for the same period of the prior year.\nGross profit and gross margin\nGross profit increased by $3.9 million, or 40.2%, to $13.5 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017 from $9.6 million for the same period of the prior year.

The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was a result of higher payroll and bonus expenses paid to the administrative and research personnel and the management team. We anticipate that our administrative expenses, particularly those related to support personnel costs, professional fees, as well as Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, will continue to increase in 2018 due to the continuing expansion of our business.\nOperating income and operating margin\nIncome from operations increased by $2.2 million, or 64.4%, to $5.6 million for the six months ended December 31, 2017 from $3.4 million for the same period of the prior year. The increase in operating income was mainly driven by an increase in revenues and partially offset by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses.
