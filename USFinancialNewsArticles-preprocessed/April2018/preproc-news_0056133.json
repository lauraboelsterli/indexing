(NYSE: RDN) today reported net income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, of $114.5 million, or $0.52 per diluted share.

For definitions and a reconciliation of these measures to the comparable GAAP measures, see Exhibits F and G.\n(3)\nAdjusted diluted net operating income per share is calculated using the company’s statutory tax rates of 21 percent in 2018 and 35 percent in 2017.\n(4)\nCalculated by dividing annualized net income by average stockholders' equity, based on the average of the beginning and ending balances for each period presented.\nAdjusted pretax operating income for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $164.1 million, compared to $125.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Adjusted diluted net operating income per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $0.59, an increase of 60 percent compared to $0.37 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nBook value per share at March 31, 2018, was $14.16, an increase of 2% compared to $13.90 at December 31, 2017, and an increase of 4% compared to $13.58 at March 31, 2017. Tangible book value per share at March 31, 2018, was $13.88, an increase of 2% compared to $13.60 at December 31, 2017, and an increase of 13% compared to $12.31 at March 31, 2017.\n“I am pleased to report Radian's excellent financial results for the first quarter, with a 17% adjusted net operating ROE, representing a 53% increase year-over-year. During the same period, we also increased net income by 50%, adjusted diluted net operating income per share by 60%, and tangible book value per share by 13%. And we continued to grow our insurance in force portfolio, which is the primary driver of future earnings for Radian,” said Radian’s Chief Executive Officer Rick Thornberry. “These results represent the success of our business strategy, the strength of our customer relationships, our financial strength and flexibility, the value of our high-quality insurance portfolio, and the performance of our outstanding team. I am confident that we are well positioned for 2018 and beyond.”\nFIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS AND RECENT EVENTS\nMortgage Insurance\nMI new insurance written (NIW) was $11.7 billion for the quarter, a decrease of 19 percent compared to $14.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of 16 percent compared to $10.1 billion in the prior-year quarter. Of the $11.7 billion in NIW in 2018, 21 percent was written with single premiums, consisting of 16 percent lender-paid and 5 percent borrower-paid. After consideration of the 65 percent ceded under the company's 2018 Single Premium Quota Share Reinsurance Transaction, total net single premiums were 7 percent of new business written in 2018. Purchase originations accounted for 89 percent of total NIW in 2018, compared to 88 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, and 84 percent a year ago. Total primary mortgage insurance in force as of March 31, 2018, grew to $204.0 billion, an increase of 2 percent compared to $200.7 billion as of December 31, 2017, and an increase of 10 percent compared to $185.9 billion as of March 31, 2017. The composition of Radian’s mortgage insurance portfolio continues to improve, with 92 percent consisting of new business written after 2008, including those loans that successfully completed the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP). Persistency, which is the percentage of mortgage insurance that remains in force after a 12-month period, was 81.0 percent as of March 31, 2018, compared to 81.1 percent as of December 31, 2017, and 77.1 percent as of March 31, 2017. Annualized persistency for the three months ended March 31, 2018, was 84.3 percent, compared to 79.4 percent for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and 84.4 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Total net premiums earned were $242.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $245.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and $221.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Mortgage insurance in force premium yield was 48.7 basis points in 2018, an increase compared to 48.1 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017, and a slight decrease compared to 48.9 in 2017. Total net mortgage insurance premium yield, which includes the impact of ceded premiums and accrued profit commission, was 47.9 basis points in 2018, compared to 49.4 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2017, and 48.0 basis points in 2017. Additional details regarding notable variable items impacting premiums earned may be found in Exhibit D. The mortgage insurance provision for losses was $37.4 million in 2018, compared to $35.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and $47.2 million in the prior-year quarter. The total number of primary delinquent loans was 24,597 as of March 31, 2018, a decrease of 12 percent compared to 27,922 as of December 31, 2017 and a decrease of 5 percent compared to 25,793 as of March 31, 2017. The total number of primary delinquent loans included 5,780 from hurricane-affected areas as of March 31, 2018, compared to 7,051 as of December 31, 2017 and 2,964 as of March 31, 2017. The company believes that these hurricane-related delinquencies have reached their peak and, based on past experience, continues to expect that these delinquencies will not result in a material number of new paid claims. Excluding the impact from hurricane-affected areas, the total number of primary delinquent loans of 18,817 decreased by 18 percent from 22,829 as of March 31, 2017. Excluding, in each case, the new notices of default from hurricane-affected areas, the total number of primary new notices of default decreased by 11 percent in 2018 from the fourth quarter of 2017, and decreased by 3 percent from 2017. The primary mortgage insurance delinquency rate decreased to 2.5 percent in 2018, compared to 2.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, and 2.8 percent in 2017. The loss ratio in 2018 was 15.4 percent, compared to 14.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017, and 21.3 percent in 2017. Mortgage insurance loss reserves were $485.2 million as of March 31, 2018, compared to $507.6 million as of December 31, 2017, and $726.2 million as of March 31, 2017. Total mortgage insurance claims paid were $59.9 million in 2018, compared to $85.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and $82.1 million in 2017. In addition, the company’s pending claim inventory declined 48 percent from March 31, 2017.\nMortgage and Real Estate Services\nTotal revenues for 2018 were $34.2 million, compared to $40.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, and $40.1 million for 2017. The adjusted pretax operating loss before corporate allocations for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $0.4 million, compared to income of $2.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and a loss of $1.2 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (Services adjusted EBITDA) for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, was $0.5 million, compared to income of $3.8 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and a loss of $0.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. Additional details regarding the non-GAAP measure Services adjusted EBITDA may be found in Exhibits E, F and G. During the first quarter, Radian acquired Entitle Direct Group, Inc., a national title insurance and settlement services company. While the financial terms of the transaction were immaterial to Radian, the acquisition is consistent with the company's growth and diversification strategy, as well as its focus on the core product offerings of its Services business. The combination of Entitle Direct's 40-state title insurance licenses and ValuAmerica, Radian's existing title agency, expands the company's geographic reach for title services and positions Radian to provide its customers across the country with title insurance and settlement services. In order to reposition its Services business to achieve sustained profitability, in 2017 Radian committed to a restructuring plan and incurred related pretax charges of $17.3 million. During 2018, pretax charges of $0.6 million were incurred, and additional charges related to the restructuring of approximately $3.1 million are expected to be incurred under this plan and to be recognized by December 31, 2018.\nConsolidated Expenses and Operating Leverage\nOther operating expenses were $63.2 million in 2018, compared to $66.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and $68.4 million in 2017.\nWhile other operating expenses in 2018 declined 8 percent year over year, revenue grew modestly over the same period, primarily driven by a 9 percent increase in net premiums earned. These results are consistent with Radian's long-term strategic objective of increasing operating leverage through accretive revenue growth and disciplined expense management.\nCAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY UPDATE\nRadian Group maintained approximately $200 million of available liquidity as of March 31, 2018. Total liquidity, which includes the company’s $225 million unsecured revolving credit facility entered into in October 2017, was approximately $425 million as of March 31, 2018. The company remains focused on improving its capital position, enhancing its return on capital, and increasing its financial flexibility, as well as positioning Radian Group for a return to investment grade ratings.\nDuring the first quarter, Radian repurchased 531,013 shares, or approximately $10 million, of Radian Group common stock. In April, the company purchased an additional 924,720 shares, or approximately $15 million, of Radian Group common stock. Under the current share repurchase authorization, which expires on July 31, 2018, the company maintains the flexibility to repurchase shares opportunistically from time to time, up to an additional $25 million, subject to its 10b5-1 plan and based on market and business conditions, stock price and other factors. In April 2018, Radian was notified that the Joint Committee on Taxation had no objection to the terms of the company's previously disclosed proposed settlement with the IRS, which we now expect to occur within the next several months. While the expected impact of the final settlement will reduce Radian's available holding company liquidity by approximately $35 million, the company expects to recognize in the second quarter a net positive impact to tax expense, net income and book value of approximately $0.14 per share. This estimated benefit is primarily related to the lower than expected interest accrued on the tax deficiency and the impact of the remeasurement of the company's deferred taxes, due to the enactment of tax reform during the fourth quarter of 2017. This amount does not include any potential related benefit from the impact on state income taxes, which has not yet been determined. As previously announced, Radian Guaranty received the proposed changes to the Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements (PMIERs). Based on this information, which has been subject to comment by the private mortgage insurance industry, Radian expects to be able to fully comply with the proposed PMIERs and to maintain an excess of Available Assets over Minimum Required Assets under the PMIERs as of the expected effective date in late 2018, without a need to take further actions to do so. The company’s expectation is not dependent upon the existing surplus note and is based on its projections for positive operating results in 2018, its strong capital position and the benefits of its reinsurance programs.\nCONFERENCE CALL\nRadian will discuss first quarter financial results in a conference call today, Thursday, April 26, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time. The conference call will be broadcast live over the Internet at http://www.radian.biz/page?name=Webcasts or at www.radian.biz . The call may also be accessed by dialing 800.398.9389 inside the U.S., or 612.332.0718 for international callers, using passcode 447268 or by referencing Radian.\nA replay of the webcast will be available on the Radian website approximately two hours after the live broadcast ends for a period of one year. A replay of the conference call will be available approximately two and a half hours after the call ends for a period of two weeks, using the following dial-in numbers and passcode: 800.475.6701 inside the U.S., or 320.365.3844 for international callers, passcode 447268.\nIn addition to the information provided in the company's earnings news release, other statistical and financial information, which is expected to be referred to during the conference call, will be available on Radian's website under Investors > Quarterly Results, or by clicking on http://www.radian.biz/page?name=QuarterlyResults .\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nRadian believes that adjusted pretax operating income, adjusted diluted net operating income per share and adjusted net operating return on equity (non-GAAP measures) facilitate evaluation of the company’s fundamental financial performance and provide relevant and meaningful information to investors about the ongoing operating results of the company. On a consolidated basis, these measures are not recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and should not be considered in isolation or viewed as substitutes for GAAP measures of performance. The measures described below have been established in order to increase transparency for the purpose of evaluating the company’s operating trends and enabling more meaningful comparisons with Radian’s competitors.\nAdjusted pretax operating income is defined as earnings excluding the impact of certain items that are not viewed as part of the operating performance of the company’s primary activities, or not expected to result in an economic impact equal to the amount reflected in pretax income (loss). Adjusted pretax operating income adjusts GAAP pretax income (loss) to remove the effects of: (i) net gains (losses) on investments and other financial instruments; (ii) loss on induced conversion and debt extinguishment; (iii) acquisition-related expenses; (iv) amortization or impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; and (v) net impairment losses recognized in earnings and losses from the sale of business lines. Adjusted diluted net operating income per share represents a diluted net income per share calculation using as its basis adjusted pretax operating income, net of taxes at the company’s statutory tax rate for the period. Adjusted net operating return on equity is calculated by dividing annualized adjusted pretax operating income, net of taxes computed using the company's statutory tax rate, by average stockholders' equity, based on the average of the beginning and ending balances for each period presented.\nThe company has also presented a non-GAAP measure for tangible book value per share, which represents book value per share less the per-share impact of goodwill and other intangible assets, net. The company uses this measure to assess the quality and growth of its capital. Because tangible book value per share is a widely used financial measure which focuses on the underlying fundamentals of the company’s financial position and operating trends without the impact of goodwill and other intangible assets, the company believes that current and prospective investors may find it useful in their analysis.\nIn addition to the above non-GAAP measures for the consolidated company, the company also presents as supplemental information a non-GAAP measure for the Services segment, representing earnings before interest, income tax provision (benefit), depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Services adjusted EBITDA is calculated by using the Services segment’s adjusted pretax operating income as described above, further adjusted to remove the impact of depreciation and corporate allocations for interest and operating expenses. Services adjusted EBITDA is presented to facilitate comparisons with other services companies, since it is a widely accepted measure of performance in the services industry.\nSee Exhibit F or Radian’s website for a description of these items, as well as Exhibit G for reconciliations to the most comparable consolidated GAAP measures.\nABOUT RADIAN\nRadian Group Inc.

These non-GAAP financial measures align with the way the Company’s business performance is evaluated by both management and the board of directors. These measures have been established in order to increase transparency for the purposes of evaluating our operating trends and enabling more meaningful comparisons with our peers. Although on a consolidated basis “adjusted pretax operating income,” “adjusted diluted net operating income per share” and \"adjusted net operating return on equity\" are non-GAAP financial measures, we believe these measures aid in understanding the underlying performance of our operations. Our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer (Radian's chief operating decision maker), uses adjusted pretax operating income (loss) as our primary measure to evaluate the fundamental financial performance of the Company’s business segments and to allocate resources to the segments. Adjusted pretax operating income is defined as GAAP consolidated pretax income (loss) excluding the effects of: (i) net gains (losses) on investments and other financial instruments; (ii) loss on induced conversion and debt extinguishment; (iii) acquisition-related expenses; (iv) amortization or impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets; and (v) net impairment losses recognized in earnings and losses from the sale of lines of business. Adjusted diluted net operating income per share is calculated by dividing (i) adjusted pretax operating income attributable to common shareholders, net of taxes computed using the company’s statutory tax rate, by (ii) the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Interest expense on convertible debt, share dilution from convertible debt and the impact of share-based compensation arrangements have been reflected in the per share calculations consistent with the accounting standard regarding earnings per share, whenever the impact is dilutive. Adjusted net operating return on equity is calculated by dividing annualized adjusted pretax operating income, net of taxes computed using the company's statutory tax rate, by average stockholders' equity, based on the average of the beginning and ending balances for each period presented. Although adjusted pretax operating income excludes certain items that have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future, the excluded items represent those that are: (i) not viewed as part of the operating performance of our primary activities or (ii) not expected to result in an economic impact equal to the amount reflected in pretax income (loss). These adjustments, along with the reasons for their treatment, are described below. (1) Net gains (losses) on investments and other financial instruments. The recognition of realized investment gains or losses can vary significantly across periods as the activity is highly discretionary based on the timing of individual securities sales due to such factors as market opportunities, our tax and capital profile and overall market cycles. Unrealized investment gains and losses arise primarily from changes in the market value of our investments that are classified as trading securities. These valuation adjustments may not necessarily result in realized economic gains or losses.\nTrends in the profitability of our fundamental operating activities can be more clearly identified without the fluctuations of these realized and unrealized gains or losses. We do not view them to be indicative of our fundamental operating activities. Therefore, these items are excluded from our calculation of adjusted pretax operating income (loss). (2) Loss on induced conversion and debt extinguishment. Gains or losses on early extinguishment of debt and losses incurred to purchase our convertible debt prior to maturity are discretionary activities that are undertaken in order to take advantage of market opportunities to strengthen our financial and capital positions; therefore, we do not view these activities as part of our operating performance. Such transactions do not reflect expected future operations and do not provide meaningful insight regarding our current or past operating trends. Therefore, these items are excluded from our calculation of adjusted pretax operating income (loss).\n(3) Acquisition-related expenses. Acquisition-related expenses represent the costs incurred to effect an acquisition of a business (i.e., a business combination). Because we pursue acquisitions on a strategic and selective basis and not in the ordinary course of our business, we do not view acquisition-related expenses as a consequence of a primary business activity. Therefore, we do not consider these expenses to be part of our operating performance and they are excluded from our calculation of adjusted pretax operating income (loss).\nRadian Group Inc. and Subsidiaries\nDefinition of Consolidated Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nExhibit F (page 2 of 2)\n(4)\nAmortization or impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets represents the periodic expense required to amortize the cost of intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are also periodically reviewed for potential impairment, and impairment adjustments are made whenever appropriate. These charges are not viewed as part of the operating performance of our primary activities and therefore are excluded from our calculation of adjusted pretax operating income (loss).\n(5)\nNet impairment losses recognized in earnings and losses from the sale of lines of business. The recognition of net impairment losses on investments and the impairment of other long-lived assets does not result in a cash payment and can vary significantly in both amount and frequency, depending on market credit cycles and other factors. Losses from the sale of lines of business are highly discretionary as a result of strategic restructuring decisions, and generally do not occur in the normal course of our business. We do not view these losses to be indicative of our fundamental operating activities. Therefore, whenever these losses occur, we exclude them from our calculation of adjusted pretax operating income (loss).\nWe have also presented a non-GAAP measure for tangible book value per share, which represents book value per share less the per-share impact of goodwill and other intangible assets, net. We use this measure to assess the quality and growth of our capital. Because tangible book value per share is a widely-used financial measure which focuses on the underlying fundamentals of our financial position and operating trends without the impact of goodwill and other intangible assets, we believe that current and prospective investors may find it useful in their analysis of the Company. In addition to the above non-GAAP measures for the consolidated company, we also have presented as supplemental information a non-GAAP measure for our Services segment, representing a measure of earnings before interest, income tax provision (benefit), depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”). We calculate Services adjusted EBITDA by using adjusted pretax operating income as described above, further adjusted to remove the impact of depreciation and corporate allocations for interest and operating expenses. We have presented Services adjusted EBITDA to facilitate comparisons with other services companies, since it is a widely accepted measure of performance in the services industry. See Exhibit G for the reconciliation of the most comparable GAAP measures, consolidated pretax income (loss), diluted net income (loss) per share, return on equity and book value per share, to our non-GAAP financial measures for the consolidated company, adjusted pretax operating income, adjusted diluted net operating income per share, adjusted net operating return on equity, and tangible book value per share, respectively. Exhibit G also contains the reconciliation of the most comparable GAAP measure, net income (loss), to Services adjusted EBITDA. Total adjusted pretax operating income, adjusted diluted net operating income per share, adjusted net operating return on equity, tangible book value per share and Services adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or viewed as substitutes for GAAP pretax income (loss), diluted net income (loss) per share, return on equity, book value per share or net income (loss). Our definitions of adjusted pretax operating income, adjusted diluted net operating income per share, adjusted net operating return on equity, tangible book value per share or Services adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly-named measures reported by other companies.
