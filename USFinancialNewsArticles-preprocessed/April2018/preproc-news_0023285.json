    "text": "(Adds background, comments)\nApril 11 (Reuters) - Australia’s QBE Insurance Group on Wednesday appointed Inder Singh as chief financial officer, replacing current CFO Michael Ford who joined the group less than a year earlier in May 2017.\nInder Singh is currently the chief financial officer for QBE’s Australian & New Zealand Operations, the company said in a statement.\nThis follows QBE recording an annual loss of about $1.2 billion in February and logging a $600 million earnings hit last October, impacted by a medley of natural disasters.\nThis is QBE’s second top executive change after the company saw its chief executive stepping down in September, capping a tumultuous period for the global insurer with cost blowouts, profit downgrades and declining shares.\n“We have commenced an accelerated reshaping of the company’s strategic focus to create a stronger and simpler QBE,” said current Chief Executive Pat Regan.
