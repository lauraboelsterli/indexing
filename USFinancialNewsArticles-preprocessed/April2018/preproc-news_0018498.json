    "text": "Twitter : \"I think Twitter is doing phenomenally well. I would buy some here. If it came down, say, 10 percent, I would buy some more. I think Twitter's a win.\"\nGTT Communications : \"We had them on. I thought they had a great business model. I praised them right then. I say buy.\"\nSteel Dynamics : \"It's a real good steel company. It's the only other one that I'll even put near Nucor , which is owned by my charitable trust.\"\nSprint : \"Sell. When I see these stories about a takeover and I don't have any more insight beyond what's already been said, I think you have to ring the register.\"\nMarriott International : \"Marriott is terrific. I don't know if you saw how well Hilton traded today. I think Marriott is great.\"\nLas Vegas Sands : \"I prefer MGM , frankly. I just think it's got a little less risk. And by the way, a lot of my friends, like Stephanie Link , like the stock of Wynn .\"\nMicron Technology : \"Look, when you see a multiple that low, it means that people believe that they will not make the earnings next year. I have to tell you, I see some weakness in flash, I'm a little worried about possible weakness in DRAM coming, so I'm not a buyer.\"\nGeneral Electric : \"There was a Cowen report out today that I read that was very significant. It said don't buy ahead of the quarter because there are some more write-downs coming. It did make me feel like, wait a second, let's hold off. If you don't own it, don't buy it.\"\nWatch the full lightning round here: show chapters Cramer's lightning round: My playbook for buying into Twitter's stock 18 Hours Ago | 04:13 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Nucor.\n ",
