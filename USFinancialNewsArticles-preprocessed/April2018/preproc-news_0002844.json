    "text": "Donovan Mitchell scored 22 points and Dante Exum added a season-high 21 points off the bench to lead the Utah Jazz to a 107-97 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies on Friday night at Vivint Smart Home Arena in Salt Lake City.\nJoe Ingles tallied 17 points, 10 assists and five rebounds for the Jazz. Utah snapped a two-game home losing streak and shot 40-of-74 (54.1 percent) from the field.\nMarc Gasol scored 28 points on 11-of-12 shooting and MarShon Brooks added 24 off the bench to lead the Grizzlies. The loss to Utah snapped a two-game winning streak for Memphis.\nUtah opened up a 24-10 lead in the first quarter after scoring baskets on four straight possessions to fuel an 18-4 run. Royce O’ Neale provided the initial spark with back-to-back jumpers and Rudy Gobert threw down a dunk to cap off the run late in the quarter.\nMemphis struggled to get anything going on offense in the first quarter. The Grizzlies shot just 6-of-19 (31.6 percent) from the field. Their 14 total points matched a season-low for a Jazz opponent in the opening quarter.\nUtah built its lead to as many as 17 points in the first half. The Jazz went up 31-14 when Derrick Favors made a layup to open the second quarter.\nMemphis trimmed the deficit back as the quarter progressed. Gasol played a big role in making it happen: He went 5-of-5 from the field and hit three 3-pointers in the second quarter alone. His final 3-pointer helped Memphis cut Utah’s lead to 50-47.\nGasol didn’t cool off after halftime. He buried back-to-back 3-pointers to finally put Memphis ahead 64-60 as part of a 10-0 run.\nExum provided a spark late in the third quarter. He drained a pair of 3-pointers and dunked the ball to put the Jazz back in front 80-74.\nMemphis closed to within 93-89 on a driving layup from Dillon Brooks. The Jazz pulled away for good when Exum hit a pair of layups and Ingles dunked the ball over three straight possessions to make it 104-91 with 2:30 left.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
