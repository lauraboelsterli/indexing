REUTERS/Charlie Saceda/File Photo \nWorkers in Boracay, the Philippines’ most popular tourist spot, appealed for aid on Sunday before the holiday island’s impending closure. \nPhilippines President Rodrigo Duterte, who described Boracay as a “cesspool,” ordered the island closed for six months starting April 26. It reflects the growing pressures on beach resorts across Southeast Asia as infrastructure buckles under record visitor numbers. \nNearly 200 Boracay businesses were found to be discharging untreated waste water into the sea, resulting in increased concentration of human faeces along the beaches and posing health risks to swimmers.

REUTERS/Charlie Saceda/File Photo \nThe central Philippines island’s informal workers - masseuses, tattoo artists, sand sculptors and boat rental owners - said they will lose their primary source of living and sought support from the government. \n“I hope there is at least some help to keep us fed daily because we have nowhere to go,” Joralyn delos Reyes, a hair stylist, said while braiding a tourist’s hair. “We can no longer farm or fish because of the hotels and foreigners living in our land.” Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Secretary Roy Cimatu holds a news conference on the closure of Boracay island at the DENR office in Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines, April 6, 2018. REUTERS/Dondi Tawatao \nThe government has prepared 2 billion pesos ($38.4 million) for a “calamity fund” to workers in Boracay. \n“Even if they give us money, can they give us jobs when Boracay closes? That’s our biggest problem,” said Yolanda Casidsid, a masseuse for 20 years. \nBut for Neo Colubio, a boat rental manager, closing Boracay will help preserve the tourist spot, allowing locals to profit in the long term. \nThe holiday island, which generated over $1 billion last year from a record two million tourists, employs around 30,000 workers. \nTo view a graphic on Boracay island shutting down, click: tmsnrt.rs/2uThVRw Reporting by Peter Blaza; writing by Neil Jerome Morales; editing by Larry King",
