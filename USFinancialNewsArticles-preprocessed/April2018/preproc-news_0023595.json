    "text": "April 12, 2018 / 2:21 PM / Updated 26 minutes ago Rugby-Versatile Bok Goosen out of retirement for Cheetahs Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nCAPE TOWN, April 12 (Reuters) - Former Springbok flyhalf Johan Goosen will come out of retirement when he lines up for South African side the Cheetahs against Munster in a PRO14 clash in Bloemfontein on Friday. \nGoosen, 25, left Racing 92 in December 2016 and announced he would be taking up a position as commercial director at a horse stud farm in Bloemfontein, infuriating the French club. \nThe versatile back has been training with the Cheetahs to keep fit ahead of a move back to France with Montpellier in July, and could fill a number of backline positions in the national side if he can prove form and fitness. \nHe will be watched this weekend by South African coach Rassie Erasmus as he seeks to stake an early claim for the 2019 World Cup in Japan. \nMontpellier paid Racing a reported fee of 1.4-million euros ($1.7 million) to buy out his contract, which had been set to run to 2020. \nGoosen, who first moved to France in 2014, has played 13 times for the Boks and started at fullback in his last test against Wales in November 2016. ($1 = 0.8128 euros) (Reporting By Nick Said Editing by Toby Davis)",
