    "text": "April 27 (Reuters) - The following are the top stories from selected Canadian newspapers. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.\nTHE GLOBE AND MAIL ** FMP Mortgage Investments Inc, a mortgage brokerage firm that raised millions from investors to finance projects for Fortress Real Developments Inc, has notified clients that it is going out of business. ( tgam.ca/2I2XlkR )\n** The leader of Ontario's Progressive Conservatives Doug Ford says he'll call for an independent inquiry into spending by Premier Kathleen Wynne's government if he wins power in June, a move that comes as both parties allege that their opponent is fiscally irresponsible. ( tgam.ca/2JznGGN )\n** The B.C. government has tipped its hand on how it would restrict diluted-bitumen shipments within its boundaries by asking the highest court in the province whether it has the authority to regulate heavy oil transport by issuing permits. ( tgam.ca/2HV5ABO )\nNATIONAL POST ** Any hope of a reasonable resolution to the Trans Mountain pipeline impasse dimmed Thursday, when a defiant British Columbia Premier John Horgan followed through with a lawsuit to confirm his province has jurisdiction to restrict an increase in bitumen shipments.
