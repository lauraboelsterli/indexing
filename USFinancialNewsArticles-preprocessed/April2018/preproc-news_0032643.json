    "text": "FALMOUTH, Maine, April 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- TideSmart Global LLC today announced, the company has hired four key members of the organization to accommodate an expanding client base including two new global clients.

Last year, the company opened its first West Coast office, TideSmart West, located in San Francisco's Financial District.\n\"2017 into early 2018 has seen a period of growth unlike anything I can recall in the history of TideSmart Global,\" Woods said. \"With our expansion to the West Coast last year and the addition of two new global clients already this year, we needed to expand our personnel in some key areas to not only service those clients but to maintain that growth. Except for perhaps the day we signed our very first client 15 years ago, I can't think of a time when I was more excited about the future of TideSmart.\"\nROBERT BRODEUR NAMED TIDESMART VICE PRESIDENT, CLIENT ENGAGEMENT: Robert Brodeur joins TideSmart from the Gigunda Group in Manchester, New Hampshire where he served in the role of general manager.
