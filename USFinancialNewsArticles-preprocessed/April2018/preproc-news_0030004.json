    "text": "NESS ZIONA, Israel, April 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --\nCollPlant (NASDAQ:CLGN) (TASE:CLGN), a regenerative medicine company utilizing its proprietary plant-based rhCollagen technology for tissue repair products (recombinant human, \"rhCollagen\"), announced that it petitioned the District Court of Tel Aviv to approve the convening of a special general meeting of its shareholders for the purpose of obtaining shareholder approval to voluntarily delist the Company's ordinary shares from the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE), while maintaining a continued listing on NASDAQ.\nYehiel Tal, CEO of Collplant, commented: \"Delisting from the TASE is the next step in CollPlant's development as the Company becomes more US facing. It is well known that the US capital markets are better equipped to value life science companies, and by having a single listing on NASDAQ, we believe that we will see increased trading volume over time and broader opportunities for accessing the US capital markets, which in turn are expected to bring greater value to our shareholders.\"\nIn addition to petitioning the Court to approve the convening of a special general meeting of its shareholders, the Company also petitioned the Court to approve the convening of a special general meeting of the holders of the Series I and K warrant holders to approve the delisting of the Series I and K warrants from the TASE within three months of the Company's report regarding the Court's approval of such delisting, and to reduce the exercise price of the Series I and K warrants, from NIS 2.40 and NIS 1.80, respectively, to NIS 1.20, commencing on the date of the Court's approval of such delisting.\nAbout CollPlant\nCollPlant is a regenerative medicine company focused on 3D bioprinting of tissues and organs, and on developing and commercializing tissue repair products for orthobiologics, and advanced wound care markets. Our products are based on our rhCollagen (recombinant human collagen) that is produced with CollPlant's proprietary plant based genetic engineering technology.\nOur products address indications for diverse fields of organ and tissue repair and are ushering in a new era in regenerative medicine. Our flagship rhCollagen BioInk product line is ideal for 3D bioprinting of tissues and organs, and our unique Vergenix line of rhCollagen products includes a soft tissue repair matrix for treating tendinopathy and a wound repair matrix to promote a rapid optimal healing of acute and chronic wounds.\nSafe Harbor Statements\nThis press release may include forward-looking statements.
