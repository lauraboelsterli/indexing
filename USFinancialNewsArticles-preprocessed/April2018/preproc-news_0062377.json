Welles Recommended to be Added to Spectrum’s Board of Directors\nHENDERSON, Nev.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NasdaqGS: SPPI), a biotechnology company with fully integrated commercial and drug development operations with a primary focus in hematology and oncology, announced today that it has taken a number of actions designed to further enhance its corporate governance practices.\nOn March 23, 2018, the board approved amendments to Spectrum’s bylaws and shareholder rights plan to establish proxy access rights, implement a majority voting standard and rescind the stockholder rights plan, commonly referred to as a poison pill. Additionally, the nominating and corporate governance committee has recommended one new candidate, Dr. Bernice Welles, to replace Dr. Rajesh Shrotriya and Dr. Luigi Lenaz, and will reduce the size of the board to eight members.\n“In response to feedback from our shareholders, we have taken steps to improve our corporate governance practices,” said Joe Turgeon, President and CEO of Spectrum Pharmaceuticals. “Recently, our board of directors facilitated the transition to new management, separation of the chairman and CEO functions, and revisions related to executive compensation. These previous changes along with the three amendments announced today, align Spectrum’s corporate governance with best practices.”\n“To further enhance and broaden the independence of our board, I am pleased to announce the nomination of Dr. Bernice Welles,” said Stuart M. Krassner, ScD, PsyD, chairman of the board. “Dr. Welles is a practicing oncologist, the chief executive officer at Alquest Therapeutics, Inc. and chief medical officer at Enject, Inc. She brings expertise and leadership in development of cutting edge biotechnology. With the addition of Dr. Welles and the recent additions of Joseph W. Turgeon and William L. Ashton, we believe we have the right balance of experience and expertise for the next stage of Spectrum’s growth. I would also like to thank Dr. Shrotriya and Dr. Lenaz for their years of service to the company.”\nThe board of directors currently consists of eight annually-elected directors. The nominating and corporate governance committee evaluates the quality of the board and nominates the best possible candidates. Acting upon the recommendation of Spectrum’s nominating and corporate governance committee, the board nominated William L. Ashton, Raymond W. Cohen, Gilles R. Gagnon, Stuart M. Krassner, Anthony E. Maida, Joseph W. Turgeon, Dolatrai M. Vyas and Bernice R. Welles for election to the board at the 2018 Annual Meeting.\nAbout Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nSpectrum Pharmaceuticals is a leading biotechnology company focused on acquiring, developing, and commercializing drug products, with a primary focus in hematology and oncology.
