    "text": "4 COMMENTS After his first week as NASA administrator, Jim Bridenstine already is juggling starkly different visions of government versus commercial endeavors to explore the moon.\nThe agency sparked strong criticism from planetary scientists in recent days for canceling the most advanced publicly-financed plan for a robotic lander, dubbed Resource Prospector, intended to search for water and ice on the lunar surface.\nOne letter from disgruntled researchers on a NASA-sponsored panel said the action was “viewed with both incredulity and dismay by our community.” Scientists working on the project, which has experienced repeated cost estimate increases, nevertheless argue that replacing it with an industry-NASA partnership would disrupt research and delay mission schedules.\nCiting budget constraints for the decision, NASA simultaneously is stepping up efforts to solicit proposals from private enterprise to build and operate alternate spacecraft for similar missions during roughly the next decade. The follow-on projects are designed to build on progress by NASA so far.\nSuch tensions between traditional big-ticket NASA programs and a surge in government-industry partnerships, projected to be less expensive and more nimble, likely will be hallmarks of Mr. Bridenstine’s tenure, according to federal and industry experts.\nLong before the former Republican Congressman from Oklahoma narrowly won confirmation, the Trump administration staked out its commitment to rely on entrepreneurs and commercial-space companies to spearhead U.S. efforts to return to the moon.\nNow, the new team at the helm of NASA is searching for effective ways to meet that goal. Last week, the agency issued a draft request for proposals covering “end-to-end commercial payload services between” earth and the moon, utilizing private launch vehicles, landers and re-entry vehicles. The document, among other things, described the move as “the latest step in a long-running effort by NASA to support the development of commercial lunar capabilities.”\nTo underscore that point, Mr. Bridenstine on Friday sent a message on twitter emphasizing NASA’s renewed focus on lunar exploration. Some technology originally slated for Resource Prospector “will go forward in an expanded lunar surface campaign,” he wrote. “More landers. More science. More exploration. More prospectors. More commercial partners.”\nIn a statement, a NASA spokeswoman said plans are under way for “a series of progressive robotic missions to the lunar surface,” envisioning increasingly larger spacecraft “leading to an eventual human lander capability.”\nElon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and Blue Origin LLC, the space-transportation startup founded and run by Amazon.com Inc. CEO Jeff Bezos, are among the companies maneuvering to benefit from that trend. But scores of smaller, less well-known firms also hope to participate, especially after NASA eventually redirects billions of tax dollars currently appropriated each year to support operations of the international space station.\nThe White House carved out only $150 million for the next fiscal year to foster what it calls a “long-term, sustained commercial presence” in orbits between the earth and the moon. But that wedge of money—along with funding for more advanced lunar landers—is anticipated to grow dramatically after the space station is retired, possibly within the next six years, according to industry officials and experts advising NASA and the Trump administration.\n“Leveraging commercial investment is more cost-effective” than NASA’s historic approach to exploration, and is essential to bring about private-public partnership models demanded by the White House, according to Joel Sercel, a commercial-space advocate who runs a startup that works with NASA.\nInternal talking points distributed by NASA last month highlighted that agency officials will ask industry players “what support they desire from NASA” to promote commercial activities in the wake of the space station’s anticipated retirement.\nWilliam Gerstenmaier, who heads up NASA’s human-exploration projects, sketched out the planned evolution of lander technology at an industry conference in Colorado earlier this month.\nInitially, commercially-built robotic landers will be able to carry about 200 pounds of scientific instruments to the lunar surface once a year. “We can take very high risks with these” early versions, he said.\nThe next steps, according to Mr. Gerstenmaier, would be to move toward “human-size” derivatives carrying up to 1,000 pounds each, and sometime in the 2030s, to deploy fully-reusable landers for crews and cargo.",
