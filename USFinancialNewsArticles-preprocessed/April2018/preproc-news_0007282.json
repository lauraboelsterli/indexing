    "text": "TOKYO, April 5 (Reuters) - Japanese stocks rose on Thursday morning after Wall Street bounced back from a sell-off triggered by an escalating U.S.-China trade spat.\nThe Nikkei jumped 1.7 percent to 21,680.83 in midmorning trade, trading above its 200-day moving average of 21,343.43.\nWall Street bounced from an initial sell-off on Wednesday, as fears of a trade war between the United States and China eased somewhat after President Donald Trump’s economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the administration was in “negotiation” with China, and not engaged in a trade war.\nThe broader Topix advanced 1.2 percent to 1,726.28, with 30 of its 33 subsectors rising.\nPrecision machinery makers, drugmakers and real estate companies outperformed. Terumo Corp rallied 4.3 percent, Canon Inc rose 2.2 percent, Chugai Pharmaceutical advanced 4.3 percent and Eisai gained 3.7 percent, while Mitsubishi Estate climbed 2.5 percent.\nSoy sauce maker Kikkoman Corp jumped more than 3 percent on hopes of lower import cost.\nSoybean prices tumbled 2.2 percent, after China announced plans to impose import duties on key U.S. imports including soybeans, beef and corn in retaliation for U.S. proposals to impose tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods.
