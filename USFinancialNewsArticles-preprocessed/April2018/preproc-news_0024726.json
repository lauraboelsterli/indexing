    "text": "ROME (Reuters) - Italy’s three main rightist parties are determined to govern together, League leader Matteo Salvini said on Thursday, calling on its potential coalition partner, the 5-Star Movement, to stop playing political games.\nNational elections last month ended in a hung parliament with the conservative bloc, comprising the League, the Brothers of Italy and Forza Italia winning the most seats while 5-Star emerged as the largest single party.\nThe 5-Star has said it is willing to govern with the League, but has ruled out working either with Forza Italia or its leader, four times prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.\nPresident Sergio Mattarella launched a second round of consultations on Thursday after a first round last week failed to break the deadlock.\nIn last week’s talks the rightist parties met Mattarella separately, but this time they saw the head of state together in a show of unity.\nAt the end of the meeting, Salvini read a joint statement saying he and his allies were ready to build a government together “as a united front”, adding that his own party would indicate the name of the prime minister.\nWith Berlusconi nodding and gesticulating alongside him, Salvini called on 5-Star to show a sense of responsibility.\n“If we continue with a political game of tactics, of ‘no’ and of vetoes while Italians suffer and wait for solutions, it would mean that the demand for change that emerged from the March 4 elections won’t be met,” Salvini said.\nReporting by Crispian Balmer, editing by Gavin Jones\n ",
