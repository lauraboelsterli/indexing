    "text": "Toronto, April 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Human Resources Professionals Association (“HRPA”) today announced it has appointed Louise Taylor Green as Chief Executive Officer, effective June 4, 2018.\n“HRPA has an evolving strategy that is underpinned by an ambitious regulatory advancement agenda. We were searching for a new Chief Executive with a passion for professional HR who will bring the organization to the next level,” said Karen Stone, Chair of the HRPA Board. “Louise is a seasoned senior executive who brings a proven track record of successful business and culture transformations in a broad range of heavily regulated industries. She is absolutely the right person to move the organization forward at this important time.”\nLouise Taylor Green has been practicing HR for over twenty years. She is currently Senior Vice President & Chief Human Resources Officer for Economical Insurance, one of Canada’s leading property and casualty carriers. Previously, Louise was the Executive Director of the National Nursing Assessment Service. Prior to that, Louise was Executive Vice President Corporate Affairs & Strategy and CHRO for Hamilton Health Sciences, Canada’s second-largest academic teaching hospital system. Before moving into healthcare, Louise spent over six years in cooperative financial services as the Vice-President of Retail Banking and Chief Human Resources Officer at FirstOntario Credit Union. Early in her career, Louise spent 11 years with Canada 3000 Airlines in progressively more responsible positions in Canada and the U.S. Louise is a regulated HR professional holding the CHRP, CHRL, and CHRE designations. She is also a Certified Management Consultant (“CMC”) and a Professional Certified Coach (“PCC”). Louise holds an MBA from Athabasca University and she completed the CHRM program at McMaster University.\n“I am absolutely thrilled to be joining the HRPA team,” Taylor Green said. “HRPA has such a high performing board and a team of incredibly talented people who are all aligned in their shared commitment to regulatory excellence. HRPA and our members understand the increasing complexity in workplaces today. This is such an important time for HR professionals to be adding value in their organizations and I am really excited to work with all of our Chapters and partners in championing HR excellence.”\nBonnie Seidman, chair of the CEO search committee, said the HRPA board is confident that Louise will hit the ground running.\n“Louise previously served on the HRPA board for six years and was a member of the task force that developed our professional competency framework,” Seidman said. “The search committee was incredibly impressed with Louise’s background and experience – she’s been in the public and private sector, has worked under all provincial and federal employment legislation, she’s run large operational functions, she’s been a P&L owner, she’s run strategy and she’s recognized as a truly transformational HR executive. We’re delighted that we were able to attract a candidate of Louise’s caliber.”\n***\nAbout HRPA:\nThe Human Resources Professionals Association protects the public interest by governing and regulating the professional practice of its more than 23,000 member registrants.
