    "text": "April 13, 2018 / 6:03 PM / Updated 10 minutes ago Israel says Iranian drone it shot down in February was carrying explosives Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nJERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel said on Friday an Iranian drone it shot down over Israeli territory in February was armed with explosives and was meant to carry out an attack. \nThe Israeli military said that after analysing the flight path and investigating the drone, it “concluded that the Iranian (unmanned aerial vehicle) was armed with explosives and was tasked to attack Israel”. \nThe drone was downed on Feb. 10 by an Israeli Apache helicopter. It had been sighted taking off from a base in Syria and was intercepted after it crossed into Israeli territory, the Israeli military said. \nIsraeli planes then struck an Iranian installation in Syria from which, the Israeli military said, the unmanned aircraft had been operated. \nAn F-16, one of at least eight Israeli planes that had been despatched, was hit by a Syrian anti-aircraft missile and crashed in northern Israel.
