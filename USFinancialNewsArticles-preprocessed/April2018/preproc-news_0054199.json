    "text": "TAMPA, Fla., April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Bloomin' Brands, Inc. (Nasdaq: BLMN) today reported results for the first quarter 2018 (\"Q1 2018\") compared to the first quarter 2017 (\"Q1 2017\").\nHighlights for Q1 2018 include the following:\nComparable restaurant sales were up 4.3% at U.S. Outback Steakhouse with traffic up 2.2% (1) ; Combined U.S. comparable restaurant sales were up 2.8% (1) ; Comparable restaurant sales were up 1.1% for Outback Steakhouse in Brazil; and Opened 12 new restaurants, including 9 in international markets.\n(1)\nFor Q1 2018, comparable restaurant sales and traffic compare the thirteen weeks from January 1, 2018 through April 1, 2018 to the thirteen weeks from January 2, 2017 through April 2, 2017.\nImpact of the Adoption of New Revenue Recognition Standard\nBeginning with Q1 2018, our financial statements include the impact of our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. We have restated historical periods to reflect the impact of this new standard. For Q1 2018 and Q1 2017, there was an approximate $0.04 increase to Adjusted Diluted EPS. For the full year Fiscal 2017, there was an approximate ($0.05) decrease to Adjusted Diluted EPS. We anticipate the impact to Fiscal 2018 to also approximate a ($0.05) decrease to Adjusted Diluted EPS, consistent with Fiscal 2017.\nIn the following table, Q1 2018 and Q1 2017 include the $0.04 increase to Adjusted Diluted EPS as described above.\nDiluted EPS and Adjusted Diluted EPS\nThe following table reconciles Diluted earnings per share to Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the periods as indicated below.\nQ1\n2018\n2017\nCHANGE\nDiluted earnings per share\n$\n0.68\n$\n0.46\n$\n0.22\nAdjustments\n0.03\n0.12\n(0.09)\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share\n$\n0.71\n$\n0.58\n$\n0.13\nSee Non-GAAP Measures later in this release.\nCEO Comments\n\"The first quarter was a strong start to what we believe will be a very good year for Bloomin' Brands,\" said Liz Smith, CEO. \"At Outback, sales and traffic remained well above the industry, and it is clear that our investments in the customer experience are working. In addition, we remain on track to meet our financial objectives for the year.\"\nFirst Quarter Financial Results\n(dollars in millions)\nQ1 2018\nQ1 2017\nCHANGE\nTotal revenues\n$\n1,116.5\n$\n1,154.7\n(3.3)\n%\nU.S. GAAP restaurant-level operating margin\n16.6\n%\n17.8\n%\n(1.2)\n%\nAdjusted restaurant-level operating margin (1)\n16.5\n%\n17.3\n%\n(0.8)\n%\nU.S. GAAP operating income margin\n7.0\n%\n6.7\n%\n0.3\n%\nAdjusted operating income margin (1)\n7.4\n%\n8.2\n%\n(0.8)\n%\n(1) See Non-GAAP Measures later in this release.\nAs described in the table below, our Q1 2018 fiscal calendar began one week later than Q1 2017. This shift impacts the comparability of the two periods. Q1 2017 includes several high-volume days between December 26th and December 31st. Q1 2018 excludes these high-volume days. This shift had an approximate ($19 million) negative impact on revenue and a (0.3%) negative impact on operating income margin.\nFirst Quarter Fiscal Calendar Calculation Dates\nJanuary 1, 2018 - April 1, 2018\nvs.\nDecember 26, 2016 - March 26, 2017\nThe decrease in total revenues was primarily due to domestic refranchising and the one-week shift in the fiscal calendar, partially offset by increases from higher comparable restaurant sales and an increase in franchise and other revenues. The increase in U.S. GAAP operating income margin was primarily due to lapping restaurant closing costs associated with restaurant closure initiatives and increases in average check. These increases were partially offset by higher labor costs from wage inflation and investments in our service model, changes in product mix, higher operating expenses and higher commodity costs. The primary difference between U.S. GAAP and adjusted operating income margin is Q1 2017 adjusted operating income margin excludes restaurant closing costs associated with restaurant closure initiatives. These costs were included as expenses in Q1 2017 U.S. GAAP operating income margin.\nFirst Quarter Comparable Restaurant Sales (1)\nTHIRTEEN WEEKS ENDED APRIL 1, 2018\nCOMPANY-OWNED\nComparable restaurant sales (stores open 18 months or more):\nU.S.\nOutback Steakhouse\n4.3\n%\nCarrabba's Italian Grill\n0.9\n%\nBonefish Grill\n(0.1)\n%\nFleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar\n2.9\n%\nCombined U.S.\n2.8\n%\nInternational\nOutback Steakhouse - Brazil\n1.1\n%\n(1) For Q1 2018, comparable restaurant sales compare the thirteen weeks from January 1, 2018 through April 1,\n2018 to the thirteen weeks from January 2, 2017 through April 2, 2017.\nDividend Declaration and Share Repurchases\nOn April 24, 2018 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.09 per share to be paid on May 18, 2018 to all stockholders of record as of the close of business on May 7, 2018.\nOn February 16, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a $150.0 million share repurchase program. As of April 26, 2018, we had $95 million remaining under this authorization. This authorization will expire on August 16, 2019.\nFiscal 2018 Financial Outlook\nThe impact of our adoption of the new revenue recognition standard is now included in our diluted earnings per share guidance. For Fiscal 2018, we expect a ($0.05) reduction in adjusted diluted earnings per share. This is consistent with the impact of adopting the new standard to Fiscal 2017 as outlined in the supplemental 8-K exhibit furnished concurrently with this release. Despite the anticipated unfavorable ($0.05) impact of this change on Fiscal 2018 results, we are maintaining our 2018 adjusted diluted earnings per share outlook of $1.38 to $1.45. The adjusted diluted earnings per share growth rate on a comparable basis is now approximately 16% to 21%, up from 11% to 16% excluding the impact of the 53rd week in 2017.\nWe are reaffirming all aspects of our full-year financial guidance as previously communicated in our February 22, 2018 earnings release except for guidance related to our tax rate. Our tax rate is now expected to be lower due to discrete tax benefits in Q1 2018 and the tax benefit of certain stock option exercises.\nFinancial Results:\nOutlook on Feb. 22\nCurrent Outlook\nU.S. GAAP effective income tax rate (1)\n9% to 10%\n6.5% to 7.5%\nAdjusted effective income tax rate (1)\n11% to 12%\n8.5% to 9.5%\n(1) The primary difference between our U.S. GAAP outlook and our adjusted outlook for both diluted earnings per share and effective income tax rate is driven by\nanticipated adjustments in connection with our relocation and restaurant closure initiatives.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call today, April 26th at 9:00 AM ET. The conference call can be accessed live over the telephone by dialing (877) 407-9039 or (201) 689-8470 for international participants. A replay will be available beginning two hours after the call and can be accessed by dialing (844) 512-2921 or (412) 317-6671 for international callers. The replay will be available through Thursday, May 3, 2018. The conference ID for the live call and replay is 13678547. The call will also be webcast live from the Company's website at http://www.bloominbrands.com under the Investors section. A replay of this webcast will be available on the Company's website after the call.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nIn addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP, this press release and related tables include certain non-GAAP measures, which present operating results on an adjusted basis. These are supplemental measures of performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the following: (i) Adjusted restaurant-level operating margin, (ii) Adjusted income from operations and the corresponding margin, (iii) Adjusted net income, (iv) Adjusted diluted earnings per share, (v) Adjusted segment restaurant-level operating margin and (vi) Adjusted segment income from operations and the corresponding margin.\nWe believe that our use of non-GAAP financial measures permits investors to assess the operating performance of our business relative to our performance based on U.S. GAAP results and relative to other companies within the restaurant industry by isolating the effects of certain items that may vary from period to period without correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. However, our inclusion of these adjusted measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items or that the items for which we have made adjustments are unusual or infrequent or will not recur. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors as they form part of the basis for how our management team and Board of Directors evaluate our operating performance, allocate resources and administer employee incentive plans.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace U.S. GAAP financial measures, and they are not necessarily standardized or comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. We maintain internal guidelines with respect to the types of adjustments we include in our non-GAAP measures. These guidelines endeavor to differentiate between types of gains and expenses that are reflective of our core operations in a period, and those that may vary from period to period without correlation to our core performance in that period. However, implementation of these guidelines necessarily involves the application of judgment, and the treatment of any items not directly addressed by, or changes to, our guidelines will be considered by our disclosure committee. You should refer to the reconciliations of non-GAAP measures in tables four, five and six included later in this release for descriptions of the actual adjustments made in the current period and the corresponding prior period.\nIn this release, we have also included forward-looking non-GAAP information under the caption \"Fiscal 2018 Financial Outlook\". This relates to our current expectations for fiscal year 2018 adjusted diluted EPS and adjusted effective income tax rate. We have also provided information with respect to our expectations for the corresponding GAAP measures.\nThe differences between our disclosed GAAP and non-GAAP expectations are described to the extent practicable under \"Fiscal 2018 Financial Outlook\". However, in addition to the general cautionary language regarding all forward-looking statements included elsewhere in this release, we note that, because the items we adjust for in our non-GAAP measures may vary from period to period without correlation to our core performance, they are by nature more difficult to predict and estimate, so additional adjustments may occur in the remainder of the fiscal year and they may significantly impact our GAAP results.\nAbout Bloomin' Brands, Inc.\nBloomin' Brands, Inc. is one of the largest casual dining restaurant companies in the world with a portfolio of leading, differentiated restaurant concepts.

The Company operates successfully with negative working capital because\ncash collected on Restaurant sales is typically received before payment is due on its current liabilities, and its\ninventory turnover rates require relatively low investment in inventories. Additionally, ongoing cash flows from\nrestaurant operations and gift card sales are used to service debt obligations and to make capital expenditures.\n(3) During the thirteen weeks ended April 1,
