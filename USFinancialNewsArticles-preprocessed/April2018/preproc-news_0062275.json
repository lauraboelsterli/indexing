    "text": "0 COMMENTS Boeing Co. BA -0.56% is nearing a deal to buy aerospace-parts specialist KLX Inc. as part of its expansion into the aircraft-services business, according to people familiar with the matter.\nThe companies are expected to announce a deal Monday, the people said, though it is possible the plan could be derailed. In December, KLX announced it had initiated a sales process in response to expressions of interest, and Boeing has had competition in its pursuit of the company from at least one private-equity firm.\nThe terms and structure of a KLX deal with Boeing couldn’t be learned. As of Friday morning, KLX had a market value of about $3.7 billion after a strong run since the December announcement. Boeing has a market value of around $200 billion following a recent surge in its shares.\nThe proposed KLX deal would be the largest acquisition so far in Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg’s ambitious plan to triple sales from services to as much as $50 billion within a decade. He said this week that the Boeing Global Services unit was looking for deals.\nBoeing has a market share of just 7% in the fragmented aircraft-services market it said is worth $2.6 trillion over the next 10 years. Providing services such as maintenance, parts and training typically generates higher margins than making aircraft or weapons systems.\nMore in the Industry\nAirbus Cuts Production Plans for A330 Jet Amid Weak Demand Germany, France Agree to Build New Fighter Jet Together Boeing to Open Plant in China This Year Wellington, Fla.-based KLX sells fasteners, bearings and other parts for commercial, military and business jets and provides logistics services. It also has an energy business, providing oil-field services and rental equipment.\nKLX forecasts sales of $2 billion this year, compared with $1.75 billion in 2017. Margins of around 17% are in line with those of Boeing’s services unit. It is unclear whether Boeing would keep the company’s energy-services business. The unit had sales of $321 million last year.\nKLX was spun off aircraft-seat maker B/E Aerospace Inc. in 2014. Last year, B/E Aerospace was acquired by Rockwell Collins Inc. in a deal that kicked off a furious round of consolidation in the sector. Rockwell Collins is now being acquired by United Technologies Corp.\nBoeing also remains in talks with Brazilian plane maker Embraer SA over establishing a joint venture focused on commercial jetliners. Boeing is expected to take a majority stake in the venture, according to people familiar with the matter.\nAny deal would carve out Embraer’s defense operation and probably its business jet unit, the Brazilian company said Friday.\nWrite to Dana Mattioli at dana.mattioli@wsj.com , Dana Cimilluca at dana.cimilluca@wsj.com and Doug Cameron at doug.cameron@wsj.com",
