    "text": "April 30, 2018 / 11:23 AM / Updated 7 hours ago EU's Barnier says must be prepared for risk of no Brexit deal Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nDUNDALK, Ireland (Reuters) - The European Union must be prepared for the real risk that negotiations over Britain’s departure from the bloc will end without a deal, the EU’s Brexit negotiator said on Monday. Michel Barnier, the European Union's chief Brexit negotiator, and Ireland's Taoiseach Leo Varadkar attend an all All-Island Civic Dialogue on Brexit in Dundalk, Ireland, April 30, 2018. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne\n“In the coming months of negotiations the key point is to conclude a withdrawal agreement. We are not yet there and to be clear, not only because of the Irish/Northern Ireland border,” Michel Barnier said at a conference in Ireland.\n“There is a real risk and we have to be prepared for any options, including no deal. It’s not my option.” Reporting by Padraic Halpin; Editing by Alison Williams",
