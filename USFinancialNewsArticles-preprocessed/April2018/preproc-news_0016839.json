Options include a staff recommendation for Metropolitan to fund its $5.2 billion share of the project’s first stage, which would include two intakes, a single tunnel and a capacity of 6,000 cubic feet of water per second. Another option calls for Metropolitan to finance up to $10.8 billion of California WaterFix, which would allow the advancement of a full three-intake, two-tunnel project with a 9,000 cfs capacity. WHEN: Tuesday, April 10, immediately following the noon meeting of Metropolitan’s Board of Directors. PLEASE NOTE: This briefing is for credentialed news media members only.\nWHERE: Conference Room 1-102, Metropolitan Water District headquarters, 700 N. Alameda St., adjacent to historic Union Station, downtown Los Angeles (Board meeting is being held in nearby Board Room.) BACKGROUND:\nAbout 30 percent of the water that flows out of taps in Southern California comes from Northern California via the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. But the Delta's delivery system is badly outdated, a problem compounded both by a declining ecosystem and a 1,100-mile levee system that is increasingly vulnerable.\nCalifornia WaterFix would modernize the state’s decades-old delivery system by building three new intakes in the northern Delta along with two tunnels to carry water to the existing aqueduct system in the southern Delta. Metropolitan’s board initially voted last October to support California WaterFix.\nThe Metropolitan Water District of Southern California is a state-established cooperative of 26 cities and water agencies serving nearly 19 million people in six counties. The district imports water from the Colorado River and Northern California to supplement local supplies, and helps its members to develop increased water conservation, recycling, storage and other resource-management programs.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180409006469/en/\nMetropolitan Water District of Southern California\nRebecca Kimitch, (213) 217-6450; (202) 821-5253, cell\nor\nBob Muir, (213) 217-6930; (213) 324-5213, cell\nSource: Metropolitan Water District of Southern California",
