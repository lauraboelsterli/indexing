    "text": "6 COMMENTS Natural gas that is supercooled and shipped around the world may be the only big growth market for the fossil-fuels industry.\nLast week, Lorenzo Simonelli, chief executive of oil-field-services giant Baker Hughes , BHGE 4.14% a GE Company, painted a bullish long-term picture. While overall fossil-fuel demand has slowed, liquefied natural gas is seen growing by 4% to 5% a year through 2040. He said the industry was surprised by how quickly demand grew last year, especially in China , and that the company sees the market getting tight by 2022.\nBut it already was tight six or seven years ago with Asian spot prices as high as three times today’s level. Then LNG megaprojects from offshore Australia to Qatar and Russia caused projected supply to outstrip booming demand. Partly built projects were shelved and some existing operators were forced to alter contracts on terms advantageous to buyers. Other buyers chose not to lock themselves in to 15- to 20-year contracts linked to oil prices. Now contracts are about a third as long with more wiggle room.\nThat is a problem for anyone seeking to finance a new project costing billions of dollars. Analysts at HSBC point out that only 12 million tons per annum of capacity were added in 2016 and 2017—about half the pace of 2009 through 2014 and not enough to meet projected demand. Growth in consumption just last year was 27 million tons.\nOne solution might be convincing banks to take on more risk, financing projects where only half of sales were contracted, not 70% or more. Another might be for wild-eyed equity investors to assume more risk. That is what is happening in the U.S. where plenty of cash seems to be pouring into facilities to export shale gas following the stunning success of pioneer Cheniere Energy . Yet another way to get projects running, according to the HSBC analysts, might be for oil-field-services companies like Baker Hughes to chip in some money themselves as investors.\nGiven the fairly long time it takes to approve and build a project, though, the market might provide the solution by getting tight again due to lack of new capacity. Sky-high spot gas prices would then attract a wave of investment, eventually leading to the next crash in prices.\nThe LNG market, long a staid cousin to oil, is starting to resemble it more and more every year—for better and for worse.\nWrite to Spencer Jakab at spencer.jakab@wsj.com",
