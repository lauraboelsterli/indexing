    "text": "April 23, 2018 / 2:45 PM / Updated 25 minutes ago Elliott discloses 5.1 percent stake in UK software firm Micro Focus   \n(Reuters) - Elliott Capital Advisors L.P on Monday disclosed a 5.1 percent stake in British software firm Micro Focus International Plc ( MCRO.L ). FILE PHOTO: A sign stands outside the offices of Micro Focus after they and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co announced that Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co will spin off and merge its non-core software assets with Britain's Micro Focus International in a deal worth $8.8 billion, in Newbury, Britain, September 8, 2016. REUTERS/Eddie Keogh \nThe news comes about two weeks after Bloomberg reported that Elliott, the New York hedge fund run by billionaire Paul Singer, had built a position in Micro Focus and plans to push for changes at the company. \nPrivate equity firms could be interested in all or parts of Micro Focus and some buyout firms have crunched the numbers and spoken to banks about the feasibility of a deal, Bloomberg reported then, adding that no formal talks between the company and potential buyers were underway. \nMicro Focus shares jumped as much as 12 percent after the Bloomberg report. The shares had been pummelled by a sales warning and its CEOâ€™s departure on March 19. Reporting by Arathy S Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Susan Fenton",
