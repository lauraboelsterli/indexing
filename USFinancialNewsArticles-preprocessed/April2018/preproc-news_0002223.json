    "text": "April 3, 2018 / 4:20 PM / Updated 5 minutes ago Two large investors criticize Deutsche Bank chairman over CEO search Oliver Hirt , Tom Sims 2 Min Read \nZURICH/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Two major Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) investors on Tuesday criticized Chairman Paul Achleitner over the lender’s performance and his handling of a search for a new chief executive. FILE PHOTO: Deutsche Bank supervisory board chairman Paul Achleitner gives a speech during the Swiss International Finance Forum in Bern, Switzerland June 20, 2017. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo \nConfidence in Achleitner has been damaged, said a major shareholder. “He makes too many excuses for strategic mistakes that fall under his responsibility,” the person said on condition of anonymity. \nAnother major investor said: “The situation is a bit odd. Achleitner is obviously not controlling the process. All is a bit chaotic at the moment.” \nBoth Chief Executive John Cryan and Achleitner have been criticized for Deutsche Bank’s share price and earnings. But Achleitner, rather than Cryan, should take the blame, said the second shareholder, who also declined to be named. \nA spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment on Achleitner’s behalf. \nThe two investors expressed frustration about news last week that Achleitner had started a search for a new CEO to replace Cryan, but had not communicated the reasons for the search to investors. \nCryan wrote to staff that he was “absolutely committed” to the bank, but Achleitner has so far remained silent. \nA third major investor, also speaking anonymously, came to Achleitner’s defense. Asked about sentiment turning against Achleitner, the investor said: “No, this is spin”. Reporting by Oliver Hirt in Zurich and Tom Sims in Frankfurt; Editing by Edward Taylor and David Holmes",
