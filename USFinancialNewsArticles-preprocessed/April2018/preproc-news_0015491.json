    "text": "Maikel Franco and Aaron Altherr each hit a grand slam, and the Philadelphia Phillies cruised past the Miami Marlins 20-1 Saturday night at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia.\nCarlos Santana also smacked a three-run home run for the Phillies. It was Santana’s 1,000th career hit.\nThe Phillies scored five runs in the first, four in the third and eight in the fourth. They compiled 20 hits, and Franco led the way with six RBIs. Eleven different Phillies had at least one hit.\nThe last time the Phillies scored at least 20 runs came April 6, 2009 against the Cincinnati Reds. The Phillies scored more runs in this game than they did in their six other games this season combined.\nVince Velasquez (1-1) threw six innings and gave up one earned run to pick up the win. Jake Thompson pitched the final three innings to earn an atypical save.\nDillon Peters (1-1) pitched only 2 2/3 innings, giving up nine earned runs on nine hits.\nVelasquez was shaky in the first with 26 pitches thrown, and the Marlins jumped ahead 1-0 when Derek Dietrich scored on a throwing error by Phillies catcher Jorge Alfaro.\nThe Phillies responded in the bottom of the first as Rhys Hoskins drew a bases-loaded walk to force in Cesar Hernandez to knot the score. One batter later, Franco ripped a 2-2 pitch from Peters for a grand slam to left, and the Phillies suddenly held a 5-1 advantage.\nPeters tossed 42 pitches to escape the first.\nAltherr followed with a grand slam in the third when he hit a 1-2 curveball, also off Peters, deep into the seats in left for a 9-1 lead. It was the third career grand slam for Altherr, who snapped an 0-for-18 slump.\nThe last time the Phillies had two grand slams in the same game came back on April 27, 2009 when Raul Ibanez and Ryan Howard each connected.\nFranco stayed red hot in the fourth when he doubled home Hoskins and Odubel Herrera for an 11-1 lead.\nAlfaro then hit an RBI single up the middle, and the lead swelled to 12-1.\nSantana kept the home runs coming with a three-run blast in the fourth for a 16-1 advantage.\nAlfaro’s solo homer in the seventh pushed the Philadelphia lead to 20-1.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
