    "text": "(Amends date in dateline)\nFRANKFURT, April 27 (Reuters) - Daimler said on Friday the profit margin on its Mercedes-Benz luxury vehicles grew to 9 percent in the first quarter, boosted by record sales even as operating profit fell 12 percent due to the absence of a year-earlier one-off gain and currency headwinds.\nEarnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) dropped to 3.34 billion euros ($4.03 billion) in the quarter ending March, below analyst expectations.\nThe return on sales at its Mercedes-Benz Cars division inched up to 9 percent in the first quarter, from 8.9 percent a year earlier, thanks to a 5 percent hike in car sales to 594,299 vehicles. ($1 = 0.8262 euros) (Reporting by Edward Taylor Editing by Maria Sheahan)\n ",
