Elephants and people play with water during the celebration of Songkran Water Festival, to commemorate Thailand's New Year in Ayutthaya, Thailand April 11, 2018. REUTERS/Jorge Silva \nThen the camera pans to a horrific road accident and the group are seen trying to douse flames engulfing the vehicles. \nThis is one of several public service announcements being aired ahead of the new year holiday, when Thailand sees a spike in road deaths as many people exit cities bound for their homes in the countryside. \nDubbed the “Seven Deadly Days”, the days before, during and after the Songkran holiday see accident rates soar, with drunk driving accounting for many crashes. Elephants spray people with water during the celebration of Songkran Water Festival, to commemorate Thailand's New Year in Ayutthaya, Thailand April 11, 2018. REUTERS/Jorge Silva \nThe seven days began on Wednesday this year and will end on Tuesday. \nThe holiday is often referred to as the world’s biggest water fight, with revellers throwing water at passing cars and motorbikes that sometimes swerve to avoid getting doused. Slideshow (4 Images) \nThailand’s roads rank among the world’s deadliest, according to the World Health Organization, and there has been little improvement despite safety campaigns over the years. \nOn Tuesday, six migrant workers from Myanmar were killed when their double-decker bus crashed into a ditch near the border town of Mae Sot, the second fatal accident in as many weeks involving migrants. \nThailand’s transport ministry said it aimed to reduce the number of road accidents by 7 percent during this Songkran festival. \nEmergency responders doubt the latest safety campaign will have much impact. \n“These campaigns are quite isolated and mostly for show only,” said Marko Cunningham from the Bangkok Free Ambulance Service, a volunteer ambulance organization. \n“Thai people know the laws and yet continue to break them,” he said. “I have always said the main problem lies with enforcement.” Reporting by Amy Sawitta Lefevre; Editing by Darren Schuettler",
