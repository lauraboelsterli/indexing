German Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann speaks at an Austrian National Bank event in Vienna, Austria, March 26, 2018. REUTERS/Heinz-Peter Bader \n“We had indications recently that the first quarter was not that brilliant,” Weidmann said in Washington, adding that this showed the “air is getting thinner” around the German economy. \nBut Weidmann said this was not unusual after years of being in an upswing: “We definitely can’t detect any reason to see an economic turning point now,” Weidmann said, adding that Germany remained in an economic boom.
