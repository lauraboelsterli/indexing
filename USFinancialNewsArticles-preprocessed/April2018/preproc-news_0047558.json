    "text": "MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SUPERVALU INC. (NYSE: SVU) today announced it has entered into definitive agreements to sell eight of its owned distribution centers, representing approximately 5.8 million square feet, to a single buyer for an aggregate purchase price, excluding closing costs and taxes, of approximately $483 million. Upon closing of the sales, SUPERVALU will enter into lease agreements for each of the facilities for an initial term of 20 years with five five-year renewal options. Adjusting for taxes and closing costs, net proceeds to SUPERVALU are estimated to be approximately $445 million. Subject to customary closing conditions, the sale and leaseback of these properties is expected to be completed in May for seven of the properties and by October for one property.\n“The completion of these sale leaseback transactions is another positive step in the continued transformation of our business,” said Mark Gross, SUPERVALU’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “By unlocking significant value in a portion of our real estate portfolio, we’re able to meaningfully pay down debt, improve our balance sheet, and deliver value to our shareholders. I appreciate the hard work and dedication from our team as we continue to move quickly on a variety of initiatives we believe position us for future success.”\nExpected Use of Proceeds\nNet proceeds from the sales will be used to reduce outstanding debt including, and as required, the payoff of a mortgage related to one of the properties being sold and a mandatory prepayment of SUPERVALU’s secured term loan.\nExpected Impact on Results of Operations\nSUPERVALU is expected to pay cash rent of approximately $31 million in the first year of these leases (approximately $24 million in fiscal 2019 based on a partial year). Due to customary rent escalators in the leases, SUPERVALU’s rent expense related to these leases will be approximately $37 million on an annual basis (approximately $27 million in fiscal 2019 based on a partial year). The resulting reduction in interest expense will depend on how and when the net proceeds are applied to reducing debt. Following the sale of these facilities, SUPERVALU will continue to own over 13 million square feet of real estate.\nIn addition, the buyer has also agreed to fund an expansion at SUPERVALU’s distribution center in Harrisburg, PA, one of the facilities included in the sale and leaseback, for an estimated cost of $20 million. The expansion, which will help support the growth of SUPERVALU’s wholesale business and broaden the availability of its Market Centre products across the network , will also be leased to SUPERVALU upon completion.\nLIST OF DISTRIBUTION CENTERS BEING SOLD AND LEASED BACK AS PART OF THIS TRANSACTION\nSUPERVALU Distribution Center Location Champaign, IL Commerce, CA Green Bay, WI Harrisburg, PA Joliet, IL Oglesby, IL Pompano Beach, FL Stockton, CA About SUPERVALU INC.\nSUPERVALU INC. is one of the largest grocery wholesalers and retailers in the U.S. with annual sales of approximately $14 billion.
