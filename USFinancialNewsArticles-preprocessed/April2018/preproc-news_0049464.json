    "text": "(Adds details, context)\nBy Camillus Eboh\nABUJA, April 26 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s state oil company illegally paid 216 billion naira ($707.4 million) in fuel subsidies in 2017, which should be reimbursed to the government, according to the findings of a Senate probe released on Thursday.\nThe investigation by the upper legislative house said that parliament had not approved those payments by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) last year, and any further spending on subsidies should be halted with immediate effect.\n“The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) should stop the illegal payments,” the report said.\nAn NNPC spokesman told Reuters: “We have neither seen nor received the report. It is when we see it and analyse it that we will officially respond.”\nFuel subsidies are a contentious issue in Nigeria, where prices are kept artificially low at 145 naira ($0.48) per litre, often as a populist tool.\nThat has meant that as fuel prices increase globally, it has become unprofitable for private petrol marketers to import, forcing NNPC to step in to prevent major shortages.\nHowever, state oil firm money spent on subsidies is meant to be included in Nigeria’s national budget, subject to approval by the national assembly.\nIn December and January, a run on petrol amid rumours of a price increase created queues lasting hours at filling stations around the country.
