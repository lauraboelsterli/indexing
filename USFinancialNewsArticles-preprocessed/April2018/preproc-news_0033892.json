    "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio, April 17, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Big Lots, Inc. (NYSE: BIG) announced today the retirement of David Campisi as President, CEO and as a member of the Board of Directors. Mr. Campisi, who had been on a leave of absence for medical reasons since December 2017, has decided to retire in order to focus fully on his health.\nLisa M. Bachmann, Executive Vice President, Chief Merchandising & Operating Officer, and Timothy A. Johnson, Executive Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Financial Officer, will continue to work closely with the Company's Executive Leadership Team (\"ELT\") and Board of Directors to carry out Mr. Campisi's executive responsibilities. The Big Lots Board has initiated a formal search process to identify a permanent successor CEO and is in the process of retaining an executive search firm to assist the Board in identifying and reviewing both internal and external candidates.\n\"On behalf of the Board, I want to thank David for his years of dedicated service to Big Lots,\" said Jim Chambers, non-executive chair of the Board. \"David has provided strong leadership during an important period in the Company's history, and one of his lasting legacies will be the talented team that he developed at Big Lots. We sincerely appreciate David's many contributions to Big Lots and wish him a long and healthy retirement.\"\nAdded Mr. Campisi, \"After considerable thought, I have decided that the best course of action – for both me personally and Big Lots as an organization – is for me to retire and focus fully on my health. I also plan to pursue additional community-based activities during my retirement. Lisa and T.J. have done an excellent job executing my responsibilities, and will continue to do so while the Board searches for my successor. I have the upmost confidence in them, along with the rest of the ELT, in continuing to successfully guide Big Lots forward.\"\nAbout Big Lots, Inc.\nHeadquartered in Columbus, Ohio, Big Lots, Inc.
