    "text": "STAVANGER, Norway, April 12 (Reuters) - A tightening of Norway’s monetary policy is drawing nearer, and should be seen as a good sign, central bank Governor Oeystein Olsen reiterated in a speech on Thursday.\n“The key policy rate will most likely be raised after summer 2018,” Olsen told a business conference in Stavanger.\nThe central bank has previously said this would indicate a hike in August or September, with most analysts pointing to the bank’s September rate meeting as the most likely time for a hike from the current record low 0.5 percent.\n“The first increase in the key policy rate is drawing closer – this is good news,” Olsen said.
