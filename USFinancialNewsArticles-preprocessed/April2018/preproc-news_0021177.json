These include the appointments of Mr R.IJ. Baan and Mr B. Bajolet and the reappointment of Mr F.R. Gugen as members of the Supervisory Board.\nShareholders also voted in favor of the proposed US$0.25 per ordinary share dividend distribution. Dividends will be paid in Euros using an exchange rate of 1.2380, which equates to €0.2019 per ordinary share.
