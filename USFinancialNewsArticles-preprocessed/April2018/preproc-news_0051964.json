    "text": "KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa., April 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Universal Health Services, Inc. (NYSE: UHS) announced today that its reported net income attributable to UHS was $223.8 million, or $2.36 per diluted share, during the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $206.1 million, or $2.12 per diluted share, during the comparable quarter of 2017. Net revenues increased 2.9% to $2.69 billion during the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $2.61 billion during the first quarter of 2017.\nFor the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, our adjusted net income attributable to UHS, as calculated on the attached Schedule of Non-GAAP Supplemental Information (\"Supplemental Schedule\"), was $232.1 million, or $2.45 per diluted share, as compared to $204.4 million, or $2.10 per diluted share, during the first quarter of 2017.\nAs reflected on the Supplemental Schedule, included in our reported results during the first quarter of 2018, is a net aggregate unfavorable after-tax impact of $8.3 million, or $.09 per diluted share, consisting of: (i) an unfavorable after-tax impact of $9.9 million, or $.11 per diluted share, resulting from a $13 million pre-tax increase in the reserve established in connection with the discussions with the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), as discussed below, and; (ii) a favorable after-tax impact of $1.6 million, or $.02 per diluted share, resulting from our 2017 adoption of ASU 2016-09, \"Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\" (\"ASU 2016-09\"). Beginning in 2018, the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recorded in connection with the implementation of electronic health records (\"EHR\") applications at our acute care hospitals no longer warrants inclusion in our presentation of adjusted net income attributable to UHS.\nAs reflected on the Supplemental Schedule, included in our reported results during the first quarter of 2017, is a net aggregate favorable after-tax impact of $1.7 million, or $.02 per diluted share, consisting of: (i) a favorable after-tax impact of $6.8 million, or $.07 per diluted share, related to our adoption of ASU 2016-09, and; (ii) an unfavorable after-tax impact of $5.1 million, or $.05 per diluted share, related to the depreciation and amortization expense recorded in connection with the implementation of EHR applications at our acute care hospitals.\nAs calculated on the attached Supplemental Schedule, our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation & amortization (\"EBITDA net of NCI\"), was $442.1 million during the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $460.3 million during the first quarter of 2017. Our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation & amortization (\"Adjusted EBITDA net of NCI\"), which excludes the impact of the above-mentioned $13.0 million pre-tax increase in the DOJ reserve recorded during the first quarter of 2018, was $455.1 million during the first quarter of 2018 as compared to $460.3 million during the first quarter of 2017.\nAcute Care Services – Three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, at our acute care hospitals owned during both periods (\"same facility basis\"), adjusted admissions (adjusted for outpatient activity) increased 2.3% and adjusted patient days increased 5.4%, as compared to the first quarter of 2017. At these facilities, net revenue per adjusted admission increased 3.4% while net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 0.4% during the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the comparable quarter of 2017. Net revenues from our acute care services on a same facility basis increased 3.7% during the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the comparable quarter of the prior year.\nBehavioral Health Care Services – Three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017:\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, at our behavioral health care facilities on a same facility basis, adjusted admissions increased 1.6% while adjusted patient days increased 0.4% as compared to the first quarter of 2017. At these facilities, net revenue per adjusted admission increased 2.0% while net revenue per adjusted patient day increased 3.2% during the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the comparable quarter in 2017. On a same facility basis, our behavioral health care services' net revenues increased 3.0% during the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities and Share Repurchase Program:\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, our net cash provided by operating activities was $364 million as compared to $483 million generated during the first quarter of 2017. The $119 million decrease was due to: (i) a $38 million unfavorable change in cash flows from foreign currency forward exchange contracts related to our investments in the U.K; (ii) a $67 million unfavorable change in accounts receivable; (iii) a $41 million unfavorable change in accrued and deferred income taxes, partially offset by; (iv) $27 million of other combined net favorable changes.\nIn November of 2017, our Board of Directors authorized a $400 million increase to our stock repurchase program, which increased the aggregate authorization to $1.2 billion from the previous $800 million authorization approved during 2016 and 2014. Pursuant to this program, we may purchase shares of our Class B Common Stock, from time to time as conditions allow, on the open market or in negotiated private transactions.\nIn conjunction with our stock repurchase program, during the first quarter of 2018, we have repurchased approximately 42,000 shares at an aggregate cost of $4.6 million (approximately $110 per share). Since inception of the program through March 31, 2018, we have repurchased approximately 7.39 million shares at an aggregate cost of $840.9 million (approximately $114 per share).\nConference call information:\nWe will hold a conference call for investors and analysts at 9:00 a.m. eastern time on April 26, 2018. The dial-in number is 1-877-648-7971.\nA live broadcast of the conference call will be available on our website at www.uhsinc.com . A replay of the call will be available following the conclusion of the live call and will be available for one full year.\nReserve-DOJ:\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we recorded a $13 million pre-tax increase to the reserve established in connection with the civil aspects of the government's investigation of certain of our behavioral health care facilities, increasing the aggregate pre-tax reserve to $35 million. Changes in the reserve may be required in future periods as discussions with the DOJ continue and additional information becomes available. We cannot predict the ultimate resolution of this matter and therefore can provide no assurance that final amounts paid in settlement or otherwise, if any, or associated costs, will not differ materially from our established reserve. Please see Item 3-Legal Proceedings in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 for additional disclosure in connection with this matter.\nAdoption of new revenue recognition standard:\nOn January 1, 2018, we adopted, using the modified retrospective approach, ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2016-08, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\" and \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)\", respectively, which provides guidance for revenue recognition. The standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The most significant change from the adoption of the new standard relates to our estimation for the allowance for doubtful accounts. Under the previous standards, our estimate for amounts not expected to be collected based upon our historical experience, were reflected as provision for doubtful accounts, included within net revenue. Under the new standard, our estimate for amounts not expected to be collected based on historical experience will continue to be recognized as a reduction to net revenue, however, not reflected separately as provision for doubtful accounts. Under the new standard, subsequent changes in estimate of collectability due to a change in the financial status of a payor, for example a bankruptcy, will be recognized as bad debt expense in operating charges. The adoption of this ASU in 2018, and amounts recognized as bad debt expense and included in other operating expenses, did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017:\nEffective January 1, 2018, our provision for income taxes, net income attributable to UHS, and net income attributable to UHS per diluted share, were favorably impacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 which made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code including, among other things, reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nGeneral Information, Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors and Non-GAAP Financial Measures:\nOne of the nation's largest and most respected hospital companies, Universal Health Services, Inc. (\"UHS\") has built an impressive record of achievement and performance. Growing steadily since its inception into an esteemed Fortune 500 corporation, UHS today has annual revenue exceeding $10 billion. In 2017, UHS was recognized as one of the World's Most Admired Companies by Fortune; ranked #276 on the Fortune 500, and listed #275 in Forbes inaugural ranking of America's Top 500 Public Companies.\nOur operating philosophy is as effective today as it was 40 years ago, enabling us to provide compassionate care to our patients and their loved ones: Build or acquire high quality hospitals in rapidly growing markets, invest in the people and equipment needed to allow each facility to thrive, and become the leading healthcare provider in each community we serve.\nHeadquartered in King of Prussia, PA, UHS has more than 83,000 employees and through its subsidiaries operates 326 inpatient acute care hospitals and behavioral health facilities and 32 outpatient and other facilities located in 37 states, Washington, D.C., the United Kingdom, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It acts as the advisor to Universal Health Realty Income Trust, a real estate investment trust (NYSE:UHT). For additional information on the Company, visit our web site: http://www.uhsinc.com .\nThis press release contains based on current management expectations. Numerous factors, including those disclosed herein, those related to healthcare industry trends and those detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (as set forth in Item 1A-Risk Factors and in Item 7-Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017), may cause the results to differ materially from those anticipated in the . Many of the factors that will determine our future results are beyond our capability to control or predict. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and therefore actual results may differ materially. Readers should not place undue reliance on such which reflect management's view only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any , or to make any other , whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nWe believe that operating income, operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to UHS, adjusted net income attributable to UHS per diluted share, EBITDA net of NCI and adjusted EBITDA net of NCI, which are non-GAAP financial measures (\"GAAP\" is Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America), are helpful to our investors as measures of our operating performance. In addition, we believe that, when applicable, comparing and discussing our financial results based on these measures, as calculated, is helpful to our investors since it neutralizes the effect in each year of material items impacting our net income attributable to UHS, such as, changes in the reserve established in connection with our discussions with the DOJ, our adoption of ASU 2016-09, and other potential items that are nonrecurring or non-operational in nature including, but not limited to, reserves for various matters including settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, costs related to extinguishment of debt, gains/losses on sales of assets and businesses, impairments of long-lived assets, and other material amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that relate to prior periods. To obtain a complete understanding of our financial performance these measures should be examined in connection with net income attributable to UHS, as determined in accordance with GAAP, and as presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in this report or in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission including our Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. Since the items included or excluded from these measures are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance under GAAP, these measures should not be considered to be alternatives to net income as a measure of our operating performance or profitability. Since these measures, as presented, are not determined in accordance with GAAP and are thus susceptible to varying calculations, they may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Investors are encouraged to use GAAP measures when evaluating our financial performance.\nUniversal Health Services, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n(in thousands, except per share

businesses operated in both the current year and prior year periods, is helpful to our investors as a measure of our operating performance. Our Same Facility results also neutralize (if applicable), the effect of items that are nonrecurring or non-operational in nature including items such as, but not limited to, reserves for various matters, settlements, legal judgments and lawsuits, cost related to extinguishment of debt, gains/losses on sales of assets and businesses, impairments of long-lived assets, the impact of the EHR applications (in 2017) and other amounts that may be reflected in the current or prior year financial statements that relate to prior periods. Our Same Facility basis results exclude from net revenues and other operating expenses, provider tax assessments incurred in each period. However, these provider tax assessments are included in net revenues and other operating expenses as reflected in the table under All Acute Care Hospital Services. The provider tax assessments had no impact on the income before income taxes as reflected on the above tables since the amounts offset between net revenues and other operating expenses. To obtain a complete understanding of our financial performance, the Same Facility results should be examined in connection with our net income as determined in accordance with GAAP and as presented herein and the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as contained in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe All Acute Care Hospital Services table summarizes the results of operations for all our acute care operations during the periods presented. These amounts include: (i) our acute care results on a same facility basis, as indicated above; (ii) the impact of the implementation of EHR applications at our acute care hospitals (in 2017); (iii) the impact of provider tax assessments which increased net revenues and other operating expenses but had no impact on income before income taxes, and; (iv) certain other amounts including the results of facilities acquired or opened during the last twelve months.\nUniversal Health Services, Inc.\nBehavioral Health Care Services\nFor the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2018 and 2017\n(in thousands)\nSame Facility - Behavioral Health Care Services\nThree months ended\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nAmount\n% of Net\nRevenues\nAmount\n% of Net\nRevenues\nNet revenues before provision for doubtful accounts\n$1,209,937\n$1,205,077\nLess: Provision for doubtful accounts\n-\n30,636\nNet revenues\n1,209,937\n100.0%\n1,174,441\n100.0%\nOperating charges:\nSalaries, wages and benefits\n630,568\n52.1%\n597,092\n50.8%\nOther operating expenses\n230,347\n19.0%\n229,888\n19.6%\nSupplies expense\n48,769\n4.0%\n47,747\n4.1%\nDepreciation and amortization\n36,743\n3.0%\n35,316\n3.0%\nLease and rental expense\n12,008\n1.0%\n10,761\n0.9%\nSubtotal-operating expenses\n958,435\n79.2%\n920,804\n78.4%\nIncome from operations\n251,502\n20.8%\n253,637\n21.6%\nInterest expense, net\n427\n0.0%\n723\n0.1%\nIncome before income taxes\n251,075\n20.8%\n252,914\n21.5%\nAll Behavioral Health Care Services\nThree months ended\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nAmount\n% of Net\nRevenues\nAmount\n% of Net\nRevenues\nNet revenues before provision for doubtful accounts\n$1,237,996\n$1,249,748\nLess: Provision for doubtful accounts\n-\n31,626\nNet revenues\n1,237,996\n100.0%\n1,218,122\n100.0%\nOperating charges:\nSalaries, wages and benefits\n642,128\n51.9%\n613,849\n50.4%\nOther operating expenses\n256,402\n20.7%\n254,478\n20.9%\nSupplies expense\n49,536\n4.0%\n49,036\n4.0%\nDepreciation and amortization\n38,454\n3.1%\n36,945\n3.0%\nLease and rental expense\n12,301\n1.0%\n11,160\n0.9%\nSubtotal-operating expenses\n998,821\n80.7%\n965,468\n79.3%\nIncome from operations\n239,175\n19.3%\n252,654\n20.7%\nInterest expense, net\n427\n0.0%\n723\n0.1%\nIncome before income taxes\n238,748\n19.3%\n251,931\n20.7%\nWe believe that providing our results on a \"Same Facility\" basis (which is a non-GAAP measure), which includes the operating results for facilities and businesses operated in both the current year and prior year periods, is helpful to our investors as a measure of our operating performance.
