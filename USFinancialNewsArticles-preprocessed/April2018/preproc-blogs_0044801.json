    "text": "Allergan will not bid for Dublin-based Shire PLC, according to sources familiar with the situation.\nEarlier Thursday Takeda Pharmaceutical revealed it made a roughly $60 billion takeover offer bid for Shire, which the drugmaker rejected. \nReuters then reported that Allergan was \"also in competing negotiations\" for Shire.\nAllergan released a statement later in the morning which said the company \"confirms that it is in the early stages of considering a possible offer for Shire plc ('Shire'). No offer has been made.\"\nBut it appears now it will not make an actual bid.\nAllergan intraday chart \n\nAllergan shares fell as much as 8.5 percent Thursday on the initial reports, but pared its losses to down 4 percent. Shire's stock is up 6 percent.\nUpdate: Allergan later confirmed in a statement \"it does not intend to make an offer for Shire.\"",
