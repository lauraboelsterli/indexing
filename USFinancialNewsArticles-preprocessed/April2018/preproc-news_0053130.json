    "text": "Volatility continues amid geopolitical threats, fear of increased regulation in the technology sector and a rising 10-year Treasury yield. The Dow Jones industrial average closed nearly 425 points lower Tuesday, only to rebound 100 points Wednesday and close nearly 60 points higher .\n\"There's always a bull market somewhere,\" Jim Cramer , the host of \" Mad Money ,\" said Wednesday. \"But this one's a wild one — not as easy to grab the bull by the horns.\"\nBut market watchers remain on edge. Cramer shared a few market strategies for U.S. investors to consider before making a move.\nFacebook \" Facebook doesn't really have a lot of Chinese exposure,\" Cramer said of the large-cap tech company.\nBut he also pointed out that many of the other large technology companies do have exposure to China and said investors should be prepared for possible retaliation.\nRecession Fears \"If it were not for retaliation, which I think is correct, by the president, it would be really hard to believe that we could be going anywhere near a recession,\" Cramer said.\nThe host went on to say that if the tariffs do happen and retaliation becomes real, it will not spread past China.\nWATCH: Cramer's strategies for volatility, tech stocks and more show chapters Cramer’s strategy for dealing with market volatility 6:54 PM ET Wed, 25 April 2018 | 08:44 Facebook.\n ",
