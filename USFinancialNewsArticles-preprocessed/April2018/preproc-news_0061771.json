    "text": "BEIJING, April 30 services industry picked up in April, an official survey showed on Monday, as the sector extended a solid run of strong activity.\nThe official non-manufacturing Purchasing rose to 54.8 from 54.6 in March.\nThe services sector accounts for over half of China’s economy, with rising wages giving Chinese consumers more spending power.\nThe composite PMI covering both manufacturing and services activity rose to 54.1 in April, from March’s 54, well above the 50-mark that separates expansion from contraction.
