    "text": "Boeing's aircraft deliveries rose about 9 percent year-over-year in the first quarter as the world's biggest planemaker benefited from higher demand for its best-selling single-aisle 737 jetliners.\nChicago-based Boeing delivered 184 commercial aircraft in the quarter ended March, it said on Tuesday.\nBoeing booked 221 net new aircraft orders in the first quarter, well ahead of the 45 bagged by chief rival Airbus SE during the same period.\nBoeing adopted a new revenue accounting standard during the quarter, which reduced its backlog of unfilled orders by 66 to 5,835 aircraft.",
