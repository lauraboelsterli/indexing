FILE PHOTO: Members of the U.S Army National Guard monitor the Oculus transportation hub ahead of the U.S presidential election in Manhattan, New York, U.S., November 7, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly \n“The president thinks it’s a good first step to have 2,000 to 4,000 and if we determine we need more, we’ll make that decision at the time,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters.
