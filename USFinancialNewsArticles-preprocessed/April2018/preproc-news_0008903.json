    "text": "TOKYO, April 2 (Reuters) - Japan’s Showa Shell Sekiyu KK said on Monday its group refineries would refine 1 percent less crude for the local market in April-June compared with a year ago, in line with their outlook for domestic demand.\nShowa Shell said its four group refineries would refine 4.73 million kilolitres (327,000 barrels per day) of crude in the second quarter of the year. They have a total capacity of 588,000 bpd.\nRefining volumes for export markets were not released.\nThe four group refineries are: Showa Shell’s 255,000-bpd Yokkaichi plant, unit Toa Oil’s 70,000-bpd Keihin plant, affiliate Seibu Oil’s 120,000-bpd Yamaguchi refinery and a 143,000-bpd Sodegaura refinery operated by Fuji Oil in which Showa Shell has a 6.6 percent stake.\nThere will be no group refinery maintenance during the three months, a Showa Shell spokeswoman said.\nIdemitsu Kosan Co has completed the purchase of just under a third of Showa Shell, but its goals for full integration have been delayed indefinitely after opposition from Idemitsu’s founding family.
