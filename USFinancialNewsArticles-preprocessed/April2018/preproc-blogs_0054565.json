It fell for me with less than half the grid finished.\nDAVID LIPPMAN user 5pts\nOh my gosh! I think I've got it! After refusing to leave a very convincing rabbit hole, I suddenly came up with the answer out of the blue. Thank you, \"post-enlightenment!\"\nI enjoyed some of the fun clues, such as 5A and 62A. (Tina)\nDAVID LIPPMAN user 5pts\nHmm...at a loss for now. At least, I hope it's just for now. (Tina)\nBill Katz user 5pts\nI've got the grid - but I'm still at sea. I don't yet see a mechanism... Perhaps tomorrow.\nFred Stadler subscriber 5pts\nI groaned when I saw that the answer was a sitcom (one of my various knowledge voids). But I grudgingly accepted that it must be fairly well known, since I did recognize it, likely without ever having watched.\nTom Shea subscriber 5pts\nRobert,\nPlease mark me down for three previous weeks with Isaac. I apologize for not owning up, but my excuse (and I'm sticking to it) is I barely attempted, meant to, but never posted because... I am now officially retired.\nI have the grid for this week, but no clue on first pass for the meta. Will attempt to solve whenever I can wipe the wide grin off my face.\nCount me hanging with Isaac for the foreseeable future. Robert Stevens subscriber 5pts\n@ Tom Shea I have you on the ship but I don't keep track of maximum numbers on the ship.\nI am with Isaac and a lot of others. Not watching sitcoms, I may have heard of this but probably have not ever seen it. Barbara Koehler subscriber 5pts\n@ Tom Shea Congratulations on your retirement! Hope you'll still have time to do puzzles, now that your days are filled with other fun stuff.\nTom Shea subscriber 5pts\n@ Barbara Koehler @ Tom Shea\nBarbara,\nThank you.\nI concur with your previous post that I wish the avatars were back (uniformly)\nI will be of course doing puzzles, probably more so, now that I have more time. (Wish Mr. Berry did a rows garden every day.)\nStill, I am frustrated I am 0 for April so far here.\nJOHN WEBBER subscriber 5pts\nMore pop culture nonsense. Shame on Gaffney.\nCRAIG BIRKER subscriber 5pts\nSo many rabbits. A virtual warren. (Heidi)\nKas DeCarvalho user 5pts\nWhen I tried to submit on my Approid, it wouldn't let me. The message was, \"Oh, just stop, you noob--you know that answer is utter @#%%...don't embarrass us.\"\nIt didn't, really...but that's why I'm strictly a pen-and-paper guy...\nJohn Cole subscriber 5pts\nBeth and I would be on shore, but the submission isn't working. We chased a couple of rabbits until we got it. I've never seen it, but got the answer. Just submitted via e-mail.\nFRIDA CHEN user 5pts\nOooh, TV! One of my favorite topics :D :D :D\nAnd just to make it more fun sprinkle in some sports, singers, and obscure (to me) clothiers\nAnd that's only in the major parts of the puzzle....So many more of these sprinkled throughout.\nCan you tell how much I'm loving this one?\nI just finished the grid and see the obvious but don't know how to use it yet...unless it involves Investigation by Google. Leaving it for now. Maybe I'll decide to go further with it....especially if any of the muggles who know me tell me that they think I should.\nKas DeCarvalho user 5pts\n@ FRIDA CHEN Resist! Resist the evil Google siren!!! :)\nBarbara Koehler subscriber 5pts\n@ FRIDA CHEN You'll have to google sitcoms. You can get it, but I don't know that you'll enjoy it.\nA L SCHWARTZ subscriber 5pts\nDone and done. Not sure I've ever watched, but certainly well known.\nThe submit function didn't work on my android this week, though. Ended up submitting by email.\nALS\nBarbara Koehler subscriber 5pts\nHmm. My knowledge of sitcoms is pretty limited. Google, here I come.\nI've got an answer that I'm pretty sure is right, but it doesn't feel completely satisfying. Not sure if that's because it just seems too easy or because I don't know enough about the show, or some other show, to recognize more complexities. Times like this, I'd really like an MGWCC-style difficulty rating. If this were a week 1 or 2 puzzle, I'd be confident I got it. If it were 3 or later, I'd keep looking.\nJOSEPH MICHAEL subscriber 5pts\nHmm...got the grid (tricky here and there though!), and I have a sense of where the meta is going\nnot ashore yet though, perhaps on a rowboat heading there, we'll see...\nEric Conrad user 5pts\nOn shore!\nAnita H user 5pts\nNice one! Count me on shore, Blue Hawaiian in hand.\nEdward Humphrey subscriber 5pts\nTwice got a response that said:\nYour submission is not working at this time\nPlease try again later.\nI guess I'll imbibe something cold in the meantime; there's an IPA chilling with my name on it.\nEd\nBarbara Koehler subscriber 5pts\n@ MIKE MILLER Is someone working on the problem of our profile pictures not showing up on the blogs - especially if we change them? I miss seeing them.\nMIKE MILLER staff 5pts\n@ Edward Humphrey Sorry you're having trouble. You can always just email crosswordcontest @wsj.com with the answer in the subject line.\nMIKE MILLER staff 5pts\n@Edward Humphrey Also, if you're able to drop a note to puzzles @wsj.com explaining the problem you encountered, that would help us address it. Thanks again.\nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts\n@ Barbara Koehler @ MIKE MILLER I have given up trying to put ups a profile picture. There is one there but it does not show up\nEdward Humphrey subscriber 5pts\nDone and Done.\nAshore.\nIt was relatively easy.\nEd\n(but not allowing me to submit the answer?)\nJanet Ross user 5pts\nI just started the grid. I hope I'll get the meta, since I don't usually watch sitcoms.\nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts\n@ Janet Ross I am with you. The number of sitcoms I have watched in the past 40 years is almost none - much to the annoyance of our daughter.\nAl Sisti user 5pts\nSafely in the sand... nice meta.\nRobert Stevens subscriber 5pts\n@ Al Sisti Well done.\nShow More Archives ADVERTISEMENT Close Let's Split The Last One (Crossword Contest, April 27)\nFrom [USER_EMAIL] To Message SEND An error has occurred, please try again later.\nThank you\nThis article has been sent to",
