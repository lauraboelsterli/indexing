    "text": "Net Income Rises 81.8% to $3.7 Million, or $0.33 Per Fully Diluted Share\nCommunity First Merger Accelerates 2018 Growth\nBRENTWOOD, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Reliant Bancorp, Inc. (“Reliant Bancorp” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: RBNC), the parent company for Reliant Bank (“Reliant”), announced today record net income, loans, deposits, and assets for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst quarter net income attributable to common shareholders rose 81.8% to $3.7 million, or $0.33 per fully diluted share, compared to $2.1 million, or $0.26 per fully diluted share for the first quarter of 2017 and $1.2 million, or $0.13 per fully diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2017.\n“Our record first quarter results highlight our organic growth since last year and the contribution from the Community First merger that closed on January 1, 2018,” stated DeVan D. Ard, Jr., Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our first quarter earnings were up 81.8% compared with the first quarter of last year and more than tripled since the fourth quarter of 2017. We benefited from growth in net interest income, a decrease in the provision for loan losses, growth in non-interest income and expenses growing at a slower pace than our revenue, due to efficiencies gained with the Community First merger. In consideration of our growth and increased profitability, the Board of Directors voted to increase our quarterly cash dividend by 33%, to $0.08 per share, during the first quarter.\n“The Community First merger created the fourth largest bank headquartered in Middle Tennessee. The merger also added depth to our leadership team and a #2 market share in Maury County and #1 market share in Hickman County. Loans and deposits passed the $1 billion mark at quarter’s end and set new records for Reliant. Net loans increased 59.2% to $1.1 billion and total deposit were up 63.3% to $1.3 billion compared with the first quarter of 2017. New loan production was strong at $98 million in the first quarter, and our loan pipeline entering the second quarter of 2018 is sufficient to meet our growth targets.\n“The Nashville area maintained its strength in job and wage growth through the fourth quarter. Total nonfarm jobs in the region increased by 2.3% in 2017, and Nashville’s unemployment rate of 2.4% was well below both the Tennessee (3.2%) and national (4.1%) averages. We expect the low unemployment rate in Middle Tennessee to continue to push wage growth in 2018. Combined with the reduction in corporate taxes, we expect 2018 will be another year of solid growth,” concluded Ard.\nKey Highlights\nNet loans rose 59.2% to $1.1 billion compared with the first quarter of 2017 and were up 43.7% from $762.5 million at December 31, 2017. Of our $333.5 million growth in the first quarter, $313.0 million, net of accounting adjustments, was attributable to the merger with Community First. Total deposits grew 63.3% to $1.3 billion compared with the first quarter of 2017 and were up 52.7% from the fourth quarter of 2017. Of our $465.9 million growth in the first quarter, $433.0 million was acquired on January 1, 2018, as part of the merger with Community First. Noninterest bearing deposits rose 67.8% to $228.1 million at March 31, 2018, compared with the first quarter of 2017 and 72.8% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Of our $96.1 million growth in the first quarter, $80.9 million was acquired as part of the merger with Community First. Net interest margin declined to 3.79% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 4.01% and 3.80% for the first and fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. The decrease in net interest margin in the first quarter of 2018 was due primarily to the effect of the tax rate change on the yield for our tax exempt securities, and expense attributed to subordinated debt acquired with the Community First merger. Noninterest income rose 162.6% to $3.0 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared with $1.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, and was up 92.6% compared with the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in first quarter noninterest income was driven by growth in service charges, higher gains on mortgage loans sold and higher other income compared with the prior periods. Noninterest expense rose 77.1% to $12.2 million compared with $6.9 million in the first quarter of 2017, and $8.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Bank segment noninterest expenses rose 68.4% and mortgage segment noninterest expenses were up 120.3% compared with the first quarter of 2017. Noninterest expenses included merger related expenses of $189,000 in the first quarter of 2018 and $869,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017. There were no comparable merger expenses in the first quarter of 2017. Core deposit intangible (CDI) amortization resulted in noninterest expense of $237,000 in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $89,000 and $56,000 for the first and fourth quarters of 2017, respectively. We are on track to recognize our estimated cost savings for the merger. During the first quarter, Reliant completed a planned investment securities restructuring that began in the fourth quarter of 2017. As part of the restructuring, Reliant sold $60.0 million of legacy Community First mortgage backed securities and purchased $79.0 million of investment grade securities including a combination of municipals, SBA floating securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. The purchased securities are modeled to provide 1.32% of additional yield on a tax equivalent basis while leaving price volatility and credit risk substantially unchanged. Our effective tax rate excluding the mortgage segment was 18.1% for the first quarter of 2018, compared with 12.8% and 45.1% for first and fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. The tax rate projected for the remainder of 2018 is approximately 19%. Asset quality remained strong at March 31, 2018. Nonperforming assets to total assets was 0.50% in the first quarter of 2018 compared with 0.57% and 0.46% for the first and fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. Other real estate owned increased to $1.7 million due to the merger compared to zero for the first and fourth quarter of 2017, respectively. Net charge-offs were 0.05% in the first quarter of 2018, down from 0.24% in the first quarter of 2017. Our provision for loan losses for the first quarter of 2018 was $137,000 compared to $410,000 and $121,000, for the first and fourth quarter of 2017, respectively.\nCapital Position\nReliant’s capital position remained strong at March 31, 2018. The tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.25%, compared with a 11.68% ratio at December 31, 2017, and 10.69% at March 31, 2017. Total stockholders’ equity rose to $201.0 million and tangible book value per common share was $12.94 at March 31, 2018, compared to $14.11 at December 31, 2017, and $12.36 at March 31, 2017, reflecting the impact of our private placement in the third quarter of 2017 and our merger with Community First in the first quarter of 2018 as well as earnings accretion. Reliant’s capital ratios are expected to be maintained significantly above the ratios of a “well-capitalized” institution.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis document contains non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP measures in this release below include “adjusted net interest margin,” “adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and related impact on ROA, ROE, and earnings per diluted share,” and “efficiency ratio.” We believe these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because these are among the measures used by our management team to evaluate our operating performance and make day-to-day operating decisions. In addition, we believe certain purchase accounting adjustments, income relating to the recoveries of purchased credit impaired loans, gains or losses on securities transactions, gains or losses on the sale of assets, gains or losses on disposal of premises and equipment, merger expenses, and deferred tax asset revaluation do not necessarily reflect the operational performance of the business in these periods; accordingly, it is useful to consider these line items with and without such adjustments. We believe this presentation also increases comparability of period-to-period results.\nOther companies may use similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures that are calculated differently from the way we calculate such measures. Accordingly, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. We caution investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP measures, but instead to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for our results as reported under generally accepted accounting principles.\nAbout Reliant Bancorp and Reliant Bank\nReliant Bancorp, Inc. is a Brentwood, Tennessee-based bank holding company which operates banking centers in Davidson, Robertson, Sumner, Williamson, Maury and Hickman counties, Tennessee along with loan and deposit production offices in Rutherford and Hamilton counties, Tennessee, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Reliant Bank.

Yields computed on tax-exempt instruments are on a tax equivalent basis. Net interest spread is calculated as the yields realized on interest-bearing assets less the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is the result of net interest income calculated on a tax-equivalent basis divided by average interest earning assets for the period. Changes in net interest income are attributed to either changes in average balances (volume change) or changes in average rates (rate change) for earning assets and sources of funds on which interest is received or paid. Volume change is calculated as change in volume times the previous rate while rate change is change in rate times the previous volume. Changes not due solely to volume or rate changes are allocated to volume change and rate change in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each category.\nRELIANT BANCORP, INC.\nSELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA\nAT OR FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n(Dollar Amounts in Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)\n(Unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Adjusted net interest margin (1) Net interest income $ 13,382 $ 8,917 $ 7,971 Purchase accounting adjustments (592 ) (141 ) (118 ) Adjusted net interest income $ 12,790 $ 8,776 $ 7,853 Adjusted net interest margin 3.63 % 3.74 % 3.96 % Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and Related Impact on ROA, ROE, and Earnings per Diluted Share (1) Net income attributable to common shareholders $ 3,741 $ 1,155 $ 2,058 Purchase accounting adjustments, net of taxes (154 ) (19 ) (16 ) Gain on securities transactions, net of taxes — — (22 ) Gain on sale of other real estate, net of taxes (66 ) (1 ) (15 ) Loss on disposal of premises and equipment, net of taxes — 1 — Merger expenses, net of taxes 153 620 — Deferred tax asset revaluation — 620 — Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders $ 3,674 $ 2,376 $ 2,005 Adjusted return on average assets 0.91 % 0.89 % 0.87 % Adjusted return on average stockholders’ equity\n7.30 % 7.02 % 7.51 % Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders, per diluted share $ 0.32 $ 0.26 $ 0.25 Efficiency ratio (subsidiary bank only excluding mortgage segment) (1) Non-interest expense $ 8,980 $ 5,691 $ 5,387 Net interest income 13,044 8,537 7,896 Tax equivalent adjustment for tax exempt interest income 419 613 474 Non-interest income 1,288 629 594 Less gain on sale of other real estate (89 ) (1 ) (24 ) Less gain on sale of securities — — (36 ) Add loss on disposal of premises and equipment — 2 — Adjusted operating income $ 14,662 $ 9,780 $ 8,904 Efficiency Ratio 61.25 % 58.19 % 60.50 % (1) Not a recognized measure under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)\n //www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180426006448/en/\nReliant Bancorp, Inc.\nDeVan Ard, 615-221-2020\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nSource: Reliant Bancorp, Inc.",
