    "text": "BRASÍLIA, April 17 (Reuters) - The European Union uses sanitary barriers without technical grounds and does not comply with World Trade Organization rules with respect to salted chicken exports from Brazil, a Brazilian government official told a press conference on Tuesday.\nSpeaking after returning from a trade mission in Brussels last week aimed at convincing Europe not to ban Brazilian poultry products, Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi said Brazil sold $317 million worth of fresh salted chicken to the EU last year.
