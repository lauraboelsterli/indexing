    "text": "(Reuters) - French luxury group Kering ( PRTP.PA ) said on Friday it had taken steps to sell skatewear label Volcom, its last remaining non luxury brand, as it focuses on its high-margin, high-end labels.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Kering is seen during the company's 2015 annual results presentation in Paris, France, February 19, 2016. REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo Kering is also preparing to spin off German sportswear brand Puma ( PUMG.DE ), which will leave it with brands ranging from Gucci to Yves Saint Laurent.\nIt acquired Volcom in 2011 for $608 million.\n“In accordance with Kering’s strategy to fully dedicate itself to the development of its luxury houses, Volcom no longer constitutes a core asset and Kering has initiated a disposal process,” the group said in a statement.\nIn a separate move, Kering and fashion label Stella McCartney said last week they had agreed to end their 17-year partnership and the British designer behind the brand would buy out Kering’s 50 percent stake.\nReporting by Ingrid Melander; Editing by Susan Fenton\n ",
