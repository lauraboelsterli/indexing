Financing deals - including Wanda's $1 billion wooing of Hollywood studio Dick Clark Productions Inc - have also collapsed. Hollywood's share of the Chinese market has lost ground to a surge of popular and sometimes patriotic-minded Chinese films.\nSo far, no major American movie has been produced at Oriental, which partially opened in 2016, except Legendary Entertainment's \"Pacific Rim: Uprising\" and \"Great Wall\".\nWanda said previously it aimed to host at least five to six Hollywood projects in its first year of full operation in 2018.\nDOMESTIC BLOCKBUSTERS\nOriental Movie Metropolis is looking to appeal to domestic demand, and is in no rush to attract Hollywood A-listers, President Sun Hengqin told Reuters in an interview, in contrast to the company's previous ambition to get major Hollywood producers to sign up.\nAll the 30 completed sound stages have been booked to make domestic movies, including a 3 billion yuan ($474 million) fantasy movie based on a Chinese classic novel, Sun said.\nSun added that production companies will not get subsidies unless they receive the green light from Chinese regulators, potentially a hurdle for foreign movie makers. China is known for its heavy-handedness in the entertainment industry and censors are tough.\n\"We are not making any commitment yet,\" David Kornblum, vice president of international sales and marketing for the Asia-Pacific at Walt Disney Studios, told Reuters on the sidelines of Saturday's launch.\nChina's box office revenue is still swelling at double-digit rates after years of breakneck growth and, with Hollywood know-how and bigger budgets, Chinese movies are gaining momentum as they find ways to play on domestic themes and improve production quality.\n($1 = 6.3325 Chinese yuan renminbi) (Reporting by Li Pei and Joseph Campbell Writing by Ryan Woo Editing by Paul Tait)",
