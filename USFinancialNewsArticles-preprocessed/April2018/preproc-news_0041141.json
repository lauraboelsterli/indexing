Mr. Morris, who has served as the Company’s Interim Chief Financial Officer since November 2017, resigned his positions as General Counsel, Chief Administrative Officer and Secretary in connection with his appointment as Chief Financial Officer.\n“David is an outstanding individual to lead Aegion’s global financial organization, which he demonstrated in the interim role while Aegion conducted a national search for the permanent CFO position,” said Charles Gordon, Aegion’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “His leadership skills and business, financial and legal acumen make him an excellent selection for Aegion’s Chief Financial Officer. David understands both our history and our vision for the future and has demonstrated both the skills and the perspective needed to lead Aegion’s financial organization as we seek to create sustainable, long-term value for Aegion’s stockholders.”\nMr. Morris has been with Aegion for more than 13 years and, prior to his appointment as Interim Chief Financial Officer, most recently served as the Company’s Executive Vice President, General Counsel, Chief Administrative Officer and Corporate Secretary, with responsibility for the Company’s legal, administrative, corporate governance, safety and compliance functions.
