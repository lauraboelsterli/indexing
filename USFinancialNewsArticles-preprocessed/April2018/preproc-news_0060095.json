    "text": "April 28, 2018 / 5:28 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Snooker - O'Sullivan ousted by Carter in fiery second-round clash Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Five-times champion Ronnie O’Sullivan was surprisingly beaten 13-9 by Ali Carter in a heated world snooker championship second-round match at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England on Saturday. Snooker - Betway UK Championship - York Barbican - 25/11/15 Ali Carter in action during his First Round Match Mandatory Credit: Action Images / Craig Brough Livepic\nO’Sullivan had only lost once to Carter in 17 previous meetings but tempers flared when the man known as ‘The Rocket’ seemed to barge into Carter in the 19th frame.\nO’Sullivan trailed 9-7 overnight and, despite winning two frames in the final session, could not put fellow Englishman Carter off course as the 38-year-old calmly sealed victory.\nThe players shook hands before Carter, beaten in the 2008 and 2012 finals by O’Sullivan, celebrated as he looked forward to facing Mark Williams or Robert Milkins in the last eight.
