With deep expertise in driving accelerated growth for organizations through both organic and M&A strategies, Trent will be instrumental in moving HBR forward during a time of vast expansion. As COO, Trent will lead HBR’s information technology, legal, marketing and talent teams.\nA dynamic leader, Trent will play an integral role in enhancing HBR’s operating model, operational execution and overall company strategy and performance. “I am thrilled to join HBR as COO and help the Firm navigate a rapidly changing market to deliver industry-leading solutions to clients,” said Trent. “I look forward to collaborating with the Firm’s experienced leadership team to further enhance its ability to serve both law firms and corporate law departments from its unique vantage point.”\nBringing more than 15 years of experience to HBR, Trent has served in a variety of senior management roles for startups, private equity portfolio companies and publicly traded corporations. Most recently, he was vice president of strategy and corporate development at Heidrick & Struggles (NASDAQ:HSII), a leading executive search firm. In this role, Trent led the development of enterprise strategy and execution of a series of acquisitions, enabling the firm to double its market capitalization in four years. Previously, he served as an operating executive for a portfolio of companies at Sterling Partners, a middle market private equity firm.\n“HBR is experiencing an exciting time of rapid growth, and Evan will be instrumental in sustaining the momentum our operations team has made in recent years,” said Nick Quil, chief executive officer of HBR. “We are continuing to make strategic hires, which demonstrates our commitment to invest in the Firm’s future. I am confident that Evan will play an integral role in continuing to scale our operations to best respond to the needs of our clients and support the growth of our team.”\nTrent’s arrival follows several key announcements involving HBR’s executive team. Last month, Nick Quil was elevated to chief executive officer and in early 2017, Kathy Carr was appointed chief financial officer. HBR’s investment in its executive team has fueled strategic partnerships and has enabled the Firm to continue to attract industry thought leaders.\nAbout HBR Consulting\nHBR Consulting ( www.hbrconsulting.com ) delivers advisory, managed services and software solutions that increase productivity and profitability, while mitigating risk for law firms, law departments and corporations.
