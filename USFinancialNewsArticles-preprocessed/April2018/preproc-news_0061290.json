GLOBAL TOP NEWS • T-Mobile, Sprint say $26 billion deal would give U.S. tech lead over China T-Mobile and Sprint said on Sunday they had agreed to a $26 billion all-stock deal and believed they could win over skeptical regulators because the merger would create thousands of jobs and help the United States beat China to creating the next generation mobile network. • China official factory PMI eases slightly in April, export orders slow Activity in China's vast manufacturing sector eased in April, as export orders slowed in another sign of ebbing economic growth, while a simmering Sino-U.S. trade row heightened risks for the industrial sector. • U.S. warns North Korea must take 'irreversible' steps to denuclearize U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that he told Kim Jong Un that the North Korea leader would have to agree to take \"irreversible\" steps toward shutting its nuclear weapons program in any deal with U.S. President Donald Trump. LOCAL MARKETS OUTLOOK • The SGX Nifty futures were trading at 10,763.50, up 0.3 percent from its previous close. GLOBAL MARKETS • Wall Street closed nearly flat on Friday as inflation worries and struggling technology and energy stocks were offset by an advance in the consumer discretionary sector led by Amazon. • Asian shares rose again as tensions in the Korean Peninsula eased and first-quarter earnings shone, although some investors pondered whether this sunny outlook could dim in the near future. • The dollar held steady against a basket of currencies, having pulled back from a 3-1/2-month high set late last week, pressured by a decline in the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield. • The margin between U.S. shorter-dated Treasury yields and longer-dated ones shrank on Friday on investors' skepticism about the global economy even as the United States fared better than other nations in the first quarter. • Oil prices edged lower as a rising rig count in the United States pointed to higher production, but prices held near more than three-year highs and were on track to rise for a second consecutive month. • Gold prices inched up early as the U.S. dollar steadied after a recent run of gains, weighed down by a decline in the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield.
