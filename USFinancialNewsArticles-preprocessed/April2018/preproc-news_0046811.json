    "text": "April 23, 2018 / 8:54 AM / Updated 19 minutes ago Paris attacks suspect gets 20-year sentence in Brussels trial Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - A Belgian judge on Monday sentenced Salah Abdeslam, the prime surviving suspect in the 2015 Islamic State attacks on Paris, to 20 years in prison over a shootout with police in Brussels in 2016. Handout file picture shows Belgian-born Salah Abdeslam on a call for witnesses notice released by the French Police Nationale information services on their twitter account November 15, 2015. Police Nationale/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo \nAbdeslamâ€™s co-defendant Sofien Ayari also received a 20-year term for attempted terrorist murder. \nWhile his lawyer argued Abdeslam, 28, should be acquitted because of a procedural error, prosecutors had charged him with attempted murder over the Brussels shootout in March 2016, days before his arrest, and called for a jail term of 20 years.
