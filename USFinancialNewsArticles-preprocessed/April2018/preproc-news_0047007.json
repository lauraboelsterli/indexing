Madoka Ikegami/Pool via REUTERS Putin will travel to China in June and his visit will be in connection with a meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), Lavrov said.\n“Today we focused on preparations for the visit of Russian President Vladimir Putin to China,” Lavrov said during a press conference in Beijing, after a meeting with Wang Yi, China’s top diplomat.\nEarlier this month, Putin said he plans to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping several times this year: at the SCO, at a meeting of BRICS countries, at the G20 Summit and at an Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, TASS cited him as saying.\nLavrov also said on Monday he had agreed with his Chinese counterpart that Moscow and Beijing would try to block any U.S. attempt to sabotage the Iran nuclear deal.\nReporting by Polina Nikolskaya; Editing by Polina Ivanova\n 0 : 0 narrow-browser-and-phone medium-browser-and-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser wide-browser-and-larger medium-browser-and-landscape-tablet medium-wide-browser-and-larger above-phone portrait-tablet-and-above above-portrait-tablet landscape-tablet-and-above landscape-tablet-and-medium-wide-browser portrait-tablet-and-below landscape-tablet-and-below Apps Newsletters Reuters Plus Advertising Guidelines Cookies Terms of Use Privacy\nAll Quote: s delayed a minimum of 15 minutes.
