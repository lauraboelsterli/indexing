    "text": "(Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp reported a better-than-expected first-quarter profit on Thursday, helped by strong growth in its assets servicing and management business.\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Corp. building at 1 Wall St. is seen in New York's financial district March 11, 2015. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo The worldâ€™s largest custodian bank said net income applicable to common shareholders rose to $1.14 billion, or $1.10 per share, in the quarter ended March 31 from $880 million, or 83 cents per share, a year earlier.\nAnalysts on average had expected earnings of 96 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nNon-interest expenses rose 3.7 pct to $2.74 billion.\nTotal revenue rose 8.7 percent to $4.18 billion.\nAssets under management jumped 8 percent to a record $1.9 trillion, driven by surging equity markets, a weaker dollar and net inflows, partially offset by the divestiture of CenterSquare Investment Management, the company said.\nReporting by Diptendu Lahiri in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva\n ",
