Please refresh the page if you do not see a player above at that time.] \nPresident Donald Trump is scheduled to visit the Miami area on Monday to promote the Republican tax bill to small Florida business owners during a roundtable discussion. \nTrump's meeting with small business owners precedes the November midterm elections. Democrats hold a seven-point lead over Republicans on the generic congressional ballot , according to an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. The passing of the tax bill was a major legislative victory for Republicans. \nEarlier this month, the Congressional Budget Office said that the bill would generate an average of 0.7 percent growth and create 1.1 million jobs over a decade. But the CBO also projected that the national debt would be 96 percent of the GDP by 2028 -- $1.6 trillion more than earlier projections. \nTrump will be joined by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin , Labor Secretary Alex Acosta and Small Business Administration head Linda McMahon during the discussion, the Associated Press reported.
