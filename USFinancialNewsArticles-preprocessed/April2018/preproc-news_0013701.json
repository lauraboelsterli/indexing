    "text": "8 COMMENTS More than a dozen small colleges have joined to yank the management of their employee retirement accounts from TIAA, the largest provider of retirement-plan services to nonprofit organizations, after it raised the fees on some of its most popular funds.\nIn Wisconsin, a group of colleges in January launched a new plan with the combined retirement account assets of three members, all of which had been with TIAA in recent years. The group expects to save 38% and 52% in fund expenses and record-keeping fees, respectively, as a result.\nFourteen small colleges in Virginia also joined a new multiemployer plan that began operating in November.\nSmall institutions around the country started looking for ways to bring down their retirement-account costs in 2015, when TIAA changed the annual-fee model on its popular CREF funds. From a previous flat fee of 0.24% of assets irrespective of clients’ size, the company started charging 0.35% of assets for institutions with less than $20 million under management—a nearly 50% increase. Plans above that size saw their costs decline.\nTIAA has $1 trillion under management and five million customers, most of them workers at nonprofit organizations such as universities, research entities and governments. It said the 2015 fee increase on small institutions would “better reflect the actual administrative and distribution expenses across the range of clients we serve.”\nFee for All Small institutions have had higher costs on employee-retirement accounts with TIAA since its CREF funds raised fees in 2015 on smallest plans.

Others are expected to participate.\nTIAA was hired as the Virginia plan’s record-keeper, but few of its funds will be among the investment choices for participants, said Robert Lambeth, president of the Council of Independent Colleges of Virginia, a group of 28 small colleges that set up the plan. Neither will TIAA be providing investment advice to plan participants, he said.\nTIAA performed both of these functions at most of the small Virginia colleges before the multiemployer plan came about.\n“We have redefined TIAA’s role to strictly record-keeping,” Mr. Lambeth said, adding that the group hired other firms to select fund offerings and provide investment advice. He said his group had “negotiated fees with TIAA that are noticeably below what the colleges were paying.”\nRetirement plan costs have become a focus at many nonprofit entities partly because of recent lawsuits highlighting outsize fees in some of these accounts.\nThe first of these cases to go to trial—a suit brought two years ago by participants in the New York University retirement plan—is scheduled to be heard by a judge in New York later this month. Plaintiffs contend New York University breached its fiduciary duty by having participants pay excessive record-keeping fees to TIAA and Vanguard Group.\n“I hope there will be some monetary compensation for the faculty to make them whole in terms of what they have lost as a result of NYU not being active enough in managing this account,” said Marie Monaco, 69, who teaches endocrinology in the NYU School of Medicine and is a plaintiff in the case.\n“Much of this case has been dismissed previously,” said NYU spokesman John Beckman. “We would have preferred it be dismissed in its entirety, because it is a baseless suit.”\nDuke University has also been sued for breaching its fiduciary duty to retirement-plan participants by selecting four record-keepers, adding to costs. Duke has said the design and management of the retirement plan was proper. No trial date has been set yet.\nIn February, Duke announced that as of next year, Fidelity Investments will be the sole record-keeper of its $4 billion plan, eliminating three other firms that had been performing the role: TIAA, Vanguard and Valic. Vanguard funds will still be offered to Duke employees following the change, but TIAA’s funds will no longer be in the mix, except for its fixed annuity, known as TIAA Traditional.\nMr. Peterson, of TIAA, said the firm is pleased to continue offering the product to Duke participants. A Vanguard representative said the firm was confident that plan sponsors and their participants would continue to entrust Vanguard with their hard-earned retirement savings.\nThe New York Attorney General is investigating allegations made by former employees of aggressive sales practices at TIAA. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission also have interviewed former employees who filed whistleblower complaints, the former employees’ lawyer said.\n“We are conducting a thorough review to ensure our actions and sales practices are aligned with our mission and values,” said the TIAA’s Mr. Peterson. “We cooperate fully with our regulators.”\nWrite to Gretchen Morgenson at gretchen.morgenson@wsj.com",
