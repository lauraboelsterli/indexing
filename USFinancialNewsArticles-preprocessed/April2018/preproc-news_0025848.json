    "text": "LIMA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temer said on Friday that he has not yet received a proposal for a tie-up between Boeing ( BA.N ) and Brazilian planemaker Embraer ( EMBR3.SA ) that is expected to entail the creation of a third company.\nFILE PHOTO: The logo of Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA is seen at the company's headquarters in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil February 28, 2018. REUTERS/Roosevelt Cassio Speaking to reporters on arrival at the Summit of the Americas in Lima, Temer said the proposal was still being studied. Sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday that a proposal submitted to the Brazilian government on Tuesday had the companies closer to a deal, but that there were still issues to be ironed out.\nReporting by Lisandra Paraguassú; Writing by Anthony Boadle; Editing by Chris Reese\n ",
