    "text": "CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Antares Capital today announced that it has appointed Timothy Lyne as senior managing director and co-head of Sponsor Coverage and Vivek Mathew as head of Asset Management and Funding.\nMr. Lyne, based in Chicago, will be responsible for leading the company’s sponsor coverage activities on the East Coast. He previously served as head of the firm’s Asset Management Group which last year added more than $3 billion of targeted loan commitments for third party investors. Mr. Lyne also led the efforts in establishing a joint venture between Antares Capital and Bain Capital Credit to provide first lien unitranche loans of up to $350 million per single transaction. He is a founding partner of Antares and was responsible for West Coast sponsor coverage activities for Antares and GE from 1996 through 2011.\n“Tim is an innovative and thoughtful leader who brings tremendous value to both his clients and teams,” said David Brackett, managing partner and co-CEO of Antares Capital. “His strong commercial focus will be a tremendous asset to our sponsor business as we continue to grow and evolve in a competitive and dynamic market.”\nMr. Mathew, based in New York, has led the firm’s funding efforts since he joined in 2016. In his new role, he’ll also lead Asset Management, which has been a key growth driver for Antares since becoming a standalone company in 2015. Mr. Mathew previously served as managing director, head of Global Primary CLO Business at J.P. Morgan. Prior to joining J.P. Morgan in 2005, Mr. Mathew was vice president, Structured Finance at Deutsche Bank.\n“Vivek hit the ground running since he joined Antares less than two years ago,” said John Martin, managing partner and co-CEO of Antares Capital. “His experience in working with investors and ratings agencies has been instrumental in closing more than $16 billion in financings to support the funding of Antares’ balance sheet, including $3.3 billion in collaterized loan obligations just last year. We are confident under Vivek’s leadership, that by combining our efforts in Asset Management with diversifying funding, we will continue to further enhance Antares’ position as a premier player in the private debt space.”\nAbout Antares\nWith more than $20 billion of capital under management and administration, Antares Capital is a private debt credit manager and leading provider of financing solutions for middle-market private equity-backed transactions.
