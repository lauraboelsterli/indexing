    "text": "BURBANK, Calif., April 30, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Imaging 3 , Inc. (OTCQB:IGNG), a development stage company introducing disruptive technologies in the medical imaging industry, announced today the appointment of George Zdasiuk, PhD, to its Board of Directors. In addition, Dr. Zdasiuk will also serve as the Chairman of the Company’s recently announced Scientific Advisory Board.\nDr. Zdasiuk will assist Imaging 3 on all matters pertaining to product development, regulatory and commercial strategy, with the goal of maximizing the global market impact and value realization from the Company’s highly disruptive Dominion SmartScan™ technology. From 1980-2015, Dr. Zdasiuk was employed by Varian Medical Systems (formerly, Varian Associates), a leader in the fields of radiotherapy, radiosurgery, X-ray tube technology and digital imaging, in roles including Chief Technology Officer and Senior VP/ Director of Varian’s Ginzton Technology Center. Varian employs 6,500 people across the globe and is recognized as a pioneer in the field of radiotherapy and medical imaging. Dr. Zdasiuk was responsible for investigating new disruptive technologies, conducting feasibility studies and incubating start-up businesses within Varian. Dr. Zdasiuk earned a Ph.D. in Applied Physics from Stanford University, specializing in photonics systems and non-linear optics. Dr. Zdasiuk received his BASc, with highest honors, in Engineering Science and his MS in Physics from the University of Toronto.\n“We are very excited to have Dr. Zdasiuk joining our Board of Directors,” noted John Hollister, CEO of Imaging 3 . “George’s track record speaks for itself, in both the professional and academic arenas, and his leadership on our Scientific Advisory Board will be invaluable. We look forward to drawing upon his extensive industry experience as we develop our technology and progress towards commercialization.”\n“The Imaging 3 Dominion SmartScan technology appears to offer some important and novel combinations of value propositions that I expect will position them with the ability to address previously under-served or un-served segments of the global market. This potential for many novel use areas presents a fascinating development challenge and commercial opportunity, and I look forward to helping the Imaging 3 team achieve their goals,” said Dr. Zdasiuk.\nJeffrey N. Peterson, Chairman of Imaging 3 , said, “Our efforts in re-building and leading the Company to achieve its global market potential require that we complete the assembly of a world-class management team and Board of Directors. Dr. Zdasiuk is a globally-recognized scientific leader in the medical imaging industry, with diverse experience in nurturing and commercializing innovative new technologies, and we are honored and pleased to welcome him to the Imaging 3 Board.”\nAbout Imaging 3 , Inc.\nImaging 3 , Inc., founded in 1993, has developed a patented medical imaging technology, called the Dominion SmartScan™, that produces 3D x-ray images, effectively in real time. The SmartScan technology has the potential to allow healthcare professionals to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures more quickly and accurately, which may result in higher throughput for the clinicians and fewer safety risks for patients. Imaging 3 ’s technology exposes patients to less harmful radiation than current equivalent imaging technologies such as CT scans. The company believes this will allow scans to be used in many settings where scanning is currently limited by concerns about radiation exposure. The technology also notably allows for reasonably convenient portability, easier installation and use-readiness, and a significantly reduced cost burden suitable for novel settings and for healthcare systems across varied global settings. Imaging 3 plans to submit a 510(k) application to FDA during 2018 to gain marketing authorization for initial applications for the SmartScan technology.\nVisit the company’s website at http://www.imaging3.com for detailed information about the company’s technology.\nSafe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements\nImaging 3 cautions you that any statement included in this press release that is not a description of historical facts is a forward-looking statement.
