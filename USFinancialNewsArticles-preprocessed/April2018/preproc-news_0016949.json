Audit procedures have been performed by the statutory auditors and the delivery of the auditors’ report is ongoing.\nIncome statement, IFRS\n(in thousands of €, except for per-share data)\nINCOME STATEMENT (K€) Decembre 31, 2017 Decembre 31, 2016 Revenue 557 268 Other operating income 2,015 1,625 Total revenue and other income 2,572 1,894 Operating expenses -8,546 -5,062 Operating loss -5,974 -3,168 Net loss -6,048 -3,574 Loss per share (€/share) -1.01 -0.92 Diluted loss per share (€/share) -1.01 -0.92 Sales in 2016 and 2017 were from Likozam® and Levidcen®, two in-licensed commercial products indicated for the treatment of epilepsy. Advicenne has commercialised these products to meet the requests of leading physicians who have no other treatment options for young people with epilepsy.\nOther income comes from a research tax credit of €0.9 million and the recognition of an up-front payment of €1.1 million from the sale of ADV6209, an in-house developed product for moderate sedation and pre-anesthesia medication, which was acquired by Primex Pharmaceuticals in February 2016.\nThe increase in operating costs is mainly due to the investments in the clinical trials of ADV7103 and for clinical trial product supply. The Company also started to prepare for the planned launch of ADV7103 in Europe.\nBalance sheet, IFRS\n(in thousands of €)\nBALANCE SHEET (K€) Decembre 31, 2017 Decembre 31, 2016 Non-current assets 226 290 Current assets 38,308 2,966 of which cash and cash equivalents 36,183 1,583 Total assets 38,533 3,256 Total shareholders' equity 33,511 -5,151 Non-current liabilities 560 286 of which borrowings and financial debt 454 206 Current liabilities 4,463 8,121 of which borrowings and financial debt 248 3,578 of which trade payables 1,314 911 of which deferred income - 1,206 of which other current liabilities 2,901 2,426 Total liabilities 38,533 3,256 Advicenne significantly strengthened its cash position in 2017 due to two capital increases – a €15.9 million private placement in March and a €27.0 million IPO in December. As of the end of December 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of over €36.2 million.\nThe other current liabilities comprise €2 million from a milestone payment made by Primex Pharmaceuticals in relation to the sale of ADV6209 and €0.9 million for tax and social debts.\nCash flow statement, IFRS\n(in € thousands)\nCASH FLOW (K€) Decembre 31, 2017 Decembre 31, 2016 Cash flow from operations -5,801 67 of which self-financing capacity -5,032 -2,961 of which variation in working capital -769 3,028 Cash flow from investing activities -338 -24 Cash flow from financing activities 40,739 -95 of which capital increase 40,830 - of which new borrowings and refundable advances 500 - Change in cash 34,600 -52 Opening cash 1,583 1,635 Closing cash 36,183 1,583 In 2017, cash flow from operations was negative by €5.8 million, due to the operating loss, as well as an increase in working capital to support the growth of the business. The positive cash flow in the year to December 31, 2016 was due to the milestone payment received from Primex Pharmaceuticals, in relation to its acquisition of ADV6209.\nMainly due to the two capital increases in 2017, the cash flow associated with the financing activities shows a positive change of €40,7million.\n“2017 was a transformational year for Advicenne during which we achieved a number of key corporate milestones. In September, we announced positive results from a European pivotal Phase III trial of ADV7103 in dRTA. This was followed by further positive 6-month follow up data in November. Earlier in the year, the EU granted ADV7103 ODD for this indication, a key step in supporting our plans to bring this novel product to market in Europe via our own commercial organization. Achieving these key milestones positioned us to complete a successful IPO and to raise the funds needed to further advance our clinical development plan in Europe and the United States and to prepare for a commercial launch of ADV7103 in Europe. I look forward to keeping you updated on our progress in 2018, during which we expect to deliver multiple value creating milestones” commented Dr Luc-Andre Granier, CEO and Co-founder of Advicenne.\nA conference call in English is scheduled today at 19:15 CEST / 13:15 EST\nWebcast link to the conference call:\nhttp://event.on24.com/wcc/r/1651991-1/763B63BFC26DE8A168465070CFA26FD2\nParticipant telephone numbers: Confirmation code: 40393609# FR: +33 170750711 UK: +44 3333000804 USA: +1 6319131422 Germany: +49 6913803430 Belgium: +32 24035814 Netherlands: +31 207095189 A replay of the call will be available on the Advicenne website following the live event.\nAbout Advicenne\nAdvicenne (Euronext: ADVIC) is a late-stage pharmaceutical company developing pediatric friendly therapeutics for the treatment of orphan renal diseases.
