    "text": "EditorsNote: Editors: Adds that it was Diaz’s 9th save in seventh graf, restores dropped word in last graf\nMarco Gonzales threw six-plus scoreless innings, and Mitch Haniger drove in the game’s only run as the visiting Seattle Mariners topped the Chicago White Sox 1-0 Tuesday at Guaranteed Rate Field.\nGonzales (2-2) allowed five hits, struck out eight and walked only one to help the Mariners bounce back from a 10-4 loss to the White Sox in the series opener Monday.\nKyle Seager ignited a two-out rally in the fourth inning with a double off Chicago starter Chris Volstad. Haniger followed with an RBI single up the middle to bring home Seager, who had two of Seattle’s five hits.\nChicago opened its Monday win over the Mariners with seven consecutive hits, but it couldn’t get anything going early against Gonzales. The White Sox managed just two hits through the first five innings off the left-hander.\nGonzales got out of a two-out jam in the sixth inning, striking out designated hitter Matt Davidson with runners on first and third.\nYoan Moncada led off the seventh inning with a double, knocking Gonzales out of the game. The Mariners’ bullpen came in and slammed the door.\nDan Altavilla, Marc Rzepczynski, Juan Nicasio and Edwin Diaz combined for three scoreless innings in relief. Diaz retired the White Sox in order in the ninth inning, striking out Davidson and Moncada for the final two outs for his ninth save.\nVolstad (0-1) allowed just one run on three hits in 4 1/3 innings. He struck out three and did not walk a batter.\nFelix Hernandez (2-2, 5.06 ERA) takes the mound for the Mariners on Wednesday in the series finale. The White Sox will counter with James Shields (1-2, 6.17).\nChicago provided a medical update on pitcher Danny Farquhar, who sustained a brain aneurysm during the Friday game against the Houston Astros. Farquhar was in critical but neurologically stable condition Tuesday. The team announced that he had the use of his extremities and was responding and speaking to family members and doctors.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
