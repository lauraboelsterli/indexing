    "text": "Oakland second baseman Jed Lowrie hit a two-run homer as the third batter of the game and left-hander Sean Manaea pitched seven strong innings as the A’s avoided a three-game series sweep in a 2-1 victory over the Seattle Mariners at Safeco Field on Sunday.\nLowrie hit a 3-0 pitch off Felix Hernandez for his fourth homer of the season after Marcus Semien singled with one out in the first inning for a quick 2-0 lead. Manaea and two relievers made it stand up for the A’s (6-10), who had lost four of five.\nManaea (2-2) gave up two hits, one a bases-empty homer by Taylor Motter, in seven innings while dropping his ERA to 1.63. He struck out four, walked two and retired the final eight he faced after Motter’s homer in the fifth inning before leaving for Ryan Buchter and Blake Treinen.\nKyle Seager’s fourth-inning single was the only other hit for the Mariners (8-5), who had a four-game winning streak broken.\nTreinen retired Jean Segura with a runner on second base to end the eighth inning and pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his third save in four chances. Treinen pitched for the first time in eight days.\nLowrie and Semien had two hits apiece for the A’s, who left runners on first and second with one out in the seventh inning and left the bases loaded with one out in the eighth. Lowrie leads the American League with 23 hits.\nHernandez (2-2) gave up five hits and two runs in 6 1/3 innings in his 47th career start against Oakland. He struck out seven and did not walk a batter. Hernandez is 25-10 against the A’s, the only active major league pitcher with at least 25 victories against one opponent.\nLowrie’s two-run homer went to right field, his opposite field. He swung at a 3-0 pitch for the first time in six opportunities this season.\n— Field Level Media\n ",
