    "text": "PHILADELPHIA, April 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Aberdeen Israel Fund, Inc. (NYSE American: ISL) (the \"Fund\"), a closed-end equity fund, today announced that it paid on April 25, 2018, a distribution of US$1.11131 per share to all shareholders of record as of April 19, 2018. The distribution was paid in all cash with no reinvestment option.\nThis distribution was made in respect to the upcoming reorganization, which is expected to close on April 27, 2018 (\"Closing Date\"). As was previously noted in the Fund's Joint Proxy/Prospectus, prior to the Closing Date, the Fund declared the distribution, distributing all of the Fund's investment company taxable income, if any, through the Closing Date, all of its net capital gains, if any, through the Closing Date, and all of its net tax-exempt interest income, if any, through the Closing Date.\nUnder U.S. tax rules applicable to the Fund, the amount and character of distributable income for each fiscal year can be finally determined only as of the end of the Fund's fiscal year. However, under Section 19 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \"1940 Act\") and related Rules, the Fund may be required to indicate to shareholders the source of certain distributions to shareholders.\nThe following table sets forth the estimated amounts of the sources of the distribution for purposes of Section 19 of the 1940 Act and the Rules adopted thereunder. The table has been computed based on generally accepted accounting principles. The table includes estimated amounts and percentages for this distribution and for the cumulative distributions paid relating to fiscal year to date (01/01/2018 â€“ 03/31/2018), from the following sources: net investment income; net realized short-term capital gains; net realized long-term capital gains; and return of capital.\nEstimated\nAmounts of\nCurrent\nDistribution\nper share ($)\nEstimated\nAmounts of\nCurrent\nDistribution\nper share (%)\nEstimated\nAmounts of Fiscal\nYear to Date\nCumulative\nDistributions\nper share ($)\nEstimated\nAmounts of Fiscal\nYear to Date\nCumulative\nDistributions\nper share (%)\nNet Investment\nIncome\n-\n-\n-\n-\nNet Realized Short-\nTerm Capital Gains\n-\n-\n-\n-\nNet Realized Long-\nTerm Capital Gains\n$1.11131\n100%\n$1.11131\n100%\nReturn of Capital\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal (per common\nshare)\n$1.11131\n100%\n$1.11131\n100%\nThe amounts and sources of distributions reported in this notice are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The final determination of the source of all distributions in 2018 will be made after year-end. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the Fund's investment experience during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to change based on tax regulations. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\nCircular 230 disclosure: To ensure compliance with requirements imposed by the U.S. Treasury, we inform you that any U.S. tax advice contained in this communication (including any attachments) is not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the purpose of (i) avoiding penalties under the Internal Revenue Code or (ii) promoting, marketing or recommending to another party any transaction or matter addressed herein.\nClosed-end funds are traded on the secondary market through one of the stock exchanges. The Fund's investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares may be worth more or less than the original cost. Shares of closed-end funds may trade above (a premium) or below (a discount) the net asset value (NAV) of the fund's portfolio. There is no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective. Past performance does not guarantee future results.\nIf you wish to receive this information electronically, please contact InvestorRelations@aberdeenstandard.com\naberdeenisl.com\nView original content with multimedia: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/aberdeen-israel-fund-inc-announces-payment-of-final-distribution-300636730.html\nSOURCE Aberdeen Israel Fund, Inc.",
