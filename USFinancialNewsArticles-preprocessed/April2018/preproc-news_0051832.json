(the “Company” or “O’Reilly”) (Nasdaq:ORLY), a leading retailer in the automotive aftermarket industry, today announced record revenues and earnings for its first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n1 st Quarter Financial Results\nGreg Henslee, O’Reilly’s CEO, commented, “Our Team’s dedication to excellent customer service drove a 3.4% increase in comparable store sales, which was above the mid-point of our guidance for the first quarter, and our relentless focus on profitable growth translated this top-line performance into a 5% increase in operating profit dollars and a 28% increase in diluted earnings per share for the first quarter. I would like to thank Team O’Reilly for their hard work and unwavering commitment to providing unsurpassed levels of service to our customers every day and for their contributions to our ongoing success.”\nSales for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, increased $126 million, or 6%, to $2.28 billion from $2.16 billion for the same period one year ago. Gross profit for the first quarter increased to $1.20 billion (or 52.6% of sales) from $1.13 billion (or 52.5% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 6%. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter increased to $778 million (or 34.1% of sales) from $728 million (or 33.8% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 7%. Operating income for the first quarter increased to $423 million (or 18.5% of sales) from $403 million (or 18.7% of sales) for the same period one year ago, representing an increase of 5%.\nNet income for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, increased $40 million, or 15%, to $305 million (or 13.4% of sales) from $265 million (or 12.3% of sales) for the same period one year ago. Diluted earnings per common share for the first quarter increased 28% to $3.61 on 85 million shares versus $2.83 on 93 million shares for the same period one year ago.\nMr. Henslee concluded, “We believe the long-term drivers for demand in our industry remain intact, including a growing and aging vehicle fleet that is driven over three trillion miles each year; but more importantly, we are very confident in our ability to continue to gain market share by providing consistently high levels of service to our customers, and we are well positioned to build on the improved trends we drove in the first quarter.”\nShare Repurchase Program\nDuring the first quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 2.2 million shares of its common stock, at an average price per share of $251.08, for a total investment of $549 million.

As of the date of this release, the Company had approximately $1.08 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorizations.\n1 st Quarter Comparable Store Sales Results\nComparable store sales are calculated based on the change in sales for stores open at least one year and exclude sales of specialty machinery, sales to independent parts stores and sales to Team Members.
