    "text": "April 16, 2018 / 1:30 PM / Updated 16 minutes ago At least 9 dead in floods in Tanzania's commercial capital Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nDAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - At least nine people in Tanzaniaâ€™s commercial capital died after heavy rains flooded homes and roads, authorities said on Monday. \nPolice chief Lazaro Mambosasa told journalists the people died as a result of heavy rainfall over the past three days. \nTelevision footage showed residents seeking shelter on rooftops. Authorities ordered schools to be closed for two days starting on Tuesday to assess infrastructure damage. \nDar es Salaam, a coastal city of 5 million, suffers from frequent floods due to poor public drainage systems and unplanned housing settlements. \nThe state-run meteorological agency said seasonal rains were expected to continue until May.
