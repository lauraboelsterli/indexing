    "text": "\nChina's central government-owned firms should strictly control debt investments and high-risk businesses in global operations, the country's state assets regulator said on Monday.\nCentrally-owned firms have cut 16 million tonnes of steel capacity and 62 million tonnes of coal capacity so far, spokesman Peng Huagang told a news briefing.\nTotal profit from China's central government-owned firms for the first three months of 2018 rose 20.9 percent from a year earlier to 377.06 billion yuan ($60.11 billion), it was also reported on Monday.\nFor March, profit rose 17.8 percent on-year to 169.87 billion yuan, according to preliminary details provided by the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) before a briefing in Beijing.\nThe average debt-to-assets ratio is at 65.9 percent at end-March, 0.4 percentage point lower compared with the beginning of this year, SASAC said.\nThe regulator will complete coal overcapacity cuts and firmly deal with \"zombie firms,\" SASAC added.\n",
