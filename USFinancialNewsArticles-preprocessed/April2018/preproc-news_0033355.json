    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Solstice Gold Corp (\"Solstice\" or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has been advised by the TSX Venture Exchange (“TSX-V”) that the Company has received conditional approval to list its common shares on the TSX-V as a Tier 2 Mining Issuer under the ticker symbol “SGC”. Approval is subject to the completion of customary listing requirements of the TSX-V, including the filing of all required documentation. The Company will provide further information once the TSX-V has confirmed an effective listing date.\nExecutive Chairman David Adamson stated, “We would like to thank our shareholders for their ongoing support. We look forward to building shareholder value as we embark on our 2018 exploration program at our highly prospective Kahuna gold project for which we plan to provide an update on in the short term.”\nThe Company would also like to announce that its Board of Directors has appointed Solstice President Marty Tunney as a director of the Company.\nAbout Solstice\nSolstice is a new gold-focussed exploration company created through the spinout by Dunnedin Ventures Inc. of 806km 2 (100%) of the district scale Kahuna Project (“Kahuna” or the “Project”) and certain other rights covering an additional 860km 2 of the Project, all with no underlying option or earn in payments. Kahuna is located in Nunavut, Canada only 26 km from Rankin Inlet and approximately 7 km from the Meliadine gold deposits owned by Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd. Solstice has 66.8 million shares outstanding and is well financed with $8 million in the treasury.\nSolstice is committed to responsible exploration and development in the communities in which we work.\nNeither TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\nOn Behalf of Solstice Gold Corp.\nDavid Adamson, PhD\nExecutive Chairman\nFor further information please visit our website at www.solsticegold.com or contact:\nMarty Tunney, PEng\nPresident\ninfo@solsticegold.com\nForward Looking Statements\nStatements included in this announcement, including statements concerning our plans, intentions and expectations, which are not historical in nature are intended to be, and are hereby identified as, \"forward-looking statements\".
