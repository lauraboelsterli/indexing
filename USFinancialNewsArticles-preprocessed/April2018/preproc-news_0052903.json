    "text": "April 27, 2018 / 3:52 PM / Updated 2 hours ago T-Mobile, Sprint finalizing merger terms: sources Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - U.S. wireless carriers T-Mobile US Inc ( TMUS.O ) and Sprint Corp ( S.N ) are finalizing terms as they seek to sign a merger deal in the next three days, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. A Sprint store sign is shown in El Cajon, California, U.S., August 8, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake\nBased on the stock exchange ratio under negotiation, T-Mobile majority-owner Deutsche Telekom ( DTEGn.DE ) will own a little over 40 percent of the combined company, but will be afforded voting control so it can consolidate the company on its books, the sources said.\nThere is always a possibility that negotiations between Deutsche Telekom and Japanâ€™s SoftBank Group Corp ( 9984.T ), the controlling shareholder of Sprint, end unsuccessfully at the last minute, the sources added. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.\nSprint, T-Mobile, Deutsche Telekom and SoftBank did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
