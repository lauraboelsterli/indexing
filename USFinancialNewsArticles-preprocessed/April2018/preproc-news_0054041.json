    "text": "17 COMMENTS Federal regulators next week will unveil proposed changes to a major rule passed in the wake of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster , which the Trump administration says it can revise to be less costly for offshore oil drillers without compromising safety.\nThe existing rule—six years in the making and known as the “well-control rule”—was completed in the final year of President Barack Obama’s second term, and governs everything from the use of blowout preventers like the device that failed in the Deepwater Horizon spill, to the amount of pressure drillers must maintain to avoid accidents.\nBut the rule, the broadest of several completed after the 2010 spill , has been a point of contention with the oil-and-gas industry, which objects to some of the costs of complying with its safety measures and what the industry says is an overly prescriptive approach by the government to regulating oil production.\nAmong the changes in the proposed rule, which is to be sent Friday for publication next week, are the elimination of a requirement that Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement vet the third-party vendors who inspect offshore oil equipment for safety. The agency will leave in place provisions requiring the use of remote-operated underwater vehicles and real-time monitoring of offshore operations, but will tweak them to make compliance easier for companies.\n“These revisions will move us forward on safety, help the government better regulate risks and better protect workers and the environment,” Erik Milito, the American Petroleum Institute’s director of upstream and industry operations said in a statement.\nStill, BSEE officials have backed off some of the changes originally intended for the well-control rule. One change the regulators won’t be making: deleting the word “safe.”\nIn a draft of the proposed changes submitted to the White House budget office late last year , the BSEE proposed eliminating a requirement that the agency affirm that plans for maintaining pressure in wells as they are drilled were safe. The agency argued in that version that the language was “redundant” and might lead regulators to overreach when deciding whether to approve drilling permits.\nInstead, according to agency officials and people familiar with the final proposal, the existing rules will remain in place, while BSEE will ask drillers to submit guidance on how the provision could be changed in the future.\nRelated\nProposed Changes to Offshore Drilling Rules Raise Safety Questions (Jan. 2, 2018) Regulators Propose Rollbacks to Offshore Drilling Safety Measures (Dec. 25, 2017) Longtime Ally of Offshore Drillers Oversees Safety Agency (Oct. 30, 2017) Scott Angelle, the director of BSEE, a division of the Interior Department, said the proposed changes to the rule will save the oil industry more than $940 million over a decade, while leaving in place more than 80% of the provisions that were included in the original rule without compromising safety.\nThe changes are “very tailored, very narrow, very thorough,” said Mr. Angelle, whose close ties to the oil industry have drawn concern from environmental advocates. He said he didn’t think his critics “would expect us to be able to make that statement today.”\nBSEE will also solicit input for future changes to the requirement for “drilling margin”—the amount of pressure drillers must maintain while drilling an undersea well to withstand a potential blowout. In the earlier version of the rule changes, BSEE had advocated deleting a requirement that the agency determine that proposed drilling margins were “safe” when approving applications to drill.\nInstead, BSEE will seek input from drillers on how they believe the existing requirement can be change, and will issue its own data showing how frequently drillers have received permission to depart from the existing minimum drilling margin, as evidence that the current rule is too rigid for the changing conditions and technology in use in the offshore industry.\n“Back in the past, half a pound probably worked, but today it might not,” said Fred Brink, a BSEE official who led the team that wrote the revisions to the rule. “We’re just trying to learn along with industry and get the soundest engineering practice that we can.”\nIn an interview, Mr. Angelle emphasized what he said was the deliberate approach his agency’s staff had taken in pursuing its revisions. Mr. Angelle repeatedly pointed to a spreadsheet that he said showed that none of the 59 changes to provisions in the existing rule would contradict safety recommendations made in 26 reports from external agencies issued in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon blowout.\n“Based on some of the articles that are out there, there’s this, perhaps, belief that there’s a sledgehammer coming to this rule. This document clearly shows that there’s not,” he said.\nThe agency also is adding some new safety provisions to the rule, Mr. Angelle said.\nStill, the BSEE rollback has alarmed former regulators who say the post-Deepwater Horizon rules haven’t been in place long enough for their effectiveness to be judged. And some have questioned whether Mr. Angelle, a longtime industry advocate who lobbied BSEE for policy changes before being appointed to his position by Mr. Trump, is too focused on advocating for oil production , rather than focusing narrowly on safety regulation.\n“One of the keystone policies of this administration has been that regulations can constrict economic growth in this country, and that’s why it’s so important when you regulate to get it right,” said Katharine MacGregor, a deputy assistant secretary at the Interior Department. “You need to never sacrifice on safety but really hit the key points to make an impact and allow development to continue.”\nWrite to Ted Mann at ted.mann@wsj.com and Timothy Puko at tim.puko@wsj.com",
