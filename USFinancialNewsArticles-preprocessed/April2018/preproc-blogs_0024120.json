Photo: The Wall Street Journal \nRemington Outdoor Co. , a Madison, N.C. manufacturer of firearms, said its Chief Financial Officer Steve Jackson is resigning to take on a similar role at another company, effective April 19. Until a new CFO is appointed, the company intends to fulfill the role’s obligations with its existing team, it said in a release.\nSempra Energy , a San Diego, Calif., utility company, appointed Trevor I. Mihalik executive vice president and CFO, effective May 1. Mr. Mihalik joined the company in 2012 as controller and chief accounting officer and was promoted to senior vice president in 2013. Previously, Mihalik served as senior vice president of finance at a U.S. subsidiary of Iberdrola SA.\nMr. Mihalik’s annual salary will be increased to $600,000 and his target bonus under the company’s annual incentive plan will be raised to 80% of his annual salary. An incremental award of restricted stock units with a grant date value of $414,000 was granted to Mr. Mihalik with an effective grant date of May 1, 2018, according to a filing. These units vest over two years with 50% of the units vesting on the first anniversary of the date of grant and the remainder vesting on the second anniversary of the date of grant. Mr. Mihalik’s current target for future annual long-term incentive awards will be increased to 210% of his annual salary.\nShare this: CFO MOVES Previous CFO Moves: Social Finance, Cooper Tire & Rubber Next The Morning Ledger: Volkswagen's CEO Set to Be Replaced  ",
