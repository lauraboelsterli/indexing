    "text": "Remind Shareholders that Glass Lewis and ISS Both Recommended Against Giving Cornwall Control of the Board\nPersonally Urge Shareholders to Protect Their Investment and Vote on the GREEN Proxy Card TODAY\nIRONWOOD, Mich.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Keweenaw Land Association, Limited (“Keweenaw” or “the Company”) (OTC Pink: KEWL) announced today that two of its highly-qualified directors, David Ayer and Brian Glodowski, have issued an open letter to the Company’s shareholders in connection with Cornwall Capital Management LP’s (“Cornwall”) nominations of three director candidates for election to Keweenaw’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) at the upcoming 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the “Annual Meeting”).\nThe full text of the letter follows:\nApril 5, 2018\nDear Keweenaw Shareholders,\nOver the last few months, you have been inundated with mailings and heard arguments from both Cornwall and the Company. We feel bound by our duty as directors of your Company to ensure that your investment is protected. And, in our view, that investment would be at risk if Cornwall Capital’s nominees take control of Keweenaw’s Board.\nClearly, you face an important decision at this year’s Annual Meeting. That is why we are reaching out to you personally.\nYour investment is important to you, and it’s also important to us – because we care about Keweenaw’s success on a deeply personal level. So please permit us to share our thoughts on why your current board is best positioned to move the Company forward and continue creating long-term shareholder value.\nWe know Keweenaw. As stewards of Keweenaw for more than 50 combined years, we have gained intimate knowledge of the timber industry and realize how crucial this experience is to run a complex business such as Keweenaw’s. We believe the current Board has a carefully crafted plan to move the Company forward – much of which is already in motion – and the industry knowledge and skills to implement it.\nYour current Board has a plan, and it is working. Keweenaw has more standing timber today than it did 25 years ago and the percentage of sawtimber has increased. Additionally, since 2014 there has been a nearly 10% year-over-year harvest volume increase. For 2018, we forecasted harvest levels to increase by 20%. We are already delivering on that goal as Q1 2018 harvest production is up 48.4% over the prior year. This is a direct result of the Board’s execution of its land acquisition and management strategy. Additionally, the REIT conversion is moving ahead and shareholders will benefit via a cash dividend as a result. The bottom line is that your Board has been working to enhance shareholder value through these efforts.\nCornwall is unfamiliar with the business and has not put forth a detailed plan. Respected proxy advisory firm Glass, Lewis & Co. stated that “none of Cornwall's nominees has relevant industry experience” and “…Cornwall failed to include a detailed timberland strategy in its four-point plan.” 1\nYour trust will be rewarded. If you give us the opportunity, your Board will continue to execute on its strategy and work towards enhancing shareholder value. However, these initiatives require a Board with industry experience and timberland knowledge, which Cornwall’s nominees do not possess. We ask you to give us the chance to demonstrate that the Board’s initiatives will increase both current returns and increased asset value. We humbly ask you to vote on the GREEN proxy card to elect the Company’s highly-qualified nominees today.\nSincerely,\nBrian D. Glodowski, Director, Chief Executive Officer, President and Secretary\nDavid Ayer, Director and Chairman of the Board\nKeweenaw Land Association Ltd.\nIf you have any questions, or need assistance voting your GREEN proxy card, please contact:\nOKAPI PARTNERS\n1212 Avenue of the Americas, 24th Floor New York, NY 10036 Telephone for Banks, Brokers, and International Shareholders: +1 212-297-0720 Shareholders may call toll-free (from the U.S. and Canada): 877-796-5274 Email: info@okapipartners.com\nAbout Keweenaw Land Association, Limited\nKeweenaw is a forest products and land management company located in Ironwood, Michigan.
