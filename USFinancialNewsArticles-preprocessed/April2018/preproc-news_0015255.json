    "text": "April 8, 2018 / 10:19 AM / Updated 3 hours ago Swansea face anxious wait over Van der Hoorn injury Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Swansea City are concerned about defender Mike van der Hoorn after the Dutchman sustained a shoulder injury in Saturday’s 1-1 draw at West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League. Soccer Football - FA Cup Fifth Round Replay - Swansea City vs Sheffield Wednesday - Liberty Stadium, Swansea, Britain - February 27, 2018 Swansea City's Mike van der Hoorn in action Action Images via Reuters/Andrew Boyers/File Photo \nThe 25-year-old, who has featured in Swansea’s last 11 league games, was substituted at half-time. Swansea earned a crucial point to move four points clear of 18th-placed Southampton, who play Arsenal later on Sunday. \n\"It was Mike's shoulder – we don't know yet what the problem is,\" manager Carlos Carvalhal told Swansea's website www.swanseacity.com . \n“He cannot move his arm at the moment, but let’s see if things get better.” \nSwansea have six league games left to play and a serious injury would rule Van der Hoorn out for the rest of the season. \nThe Welsh side host ninth-placed Everton in the league next Saturday.
