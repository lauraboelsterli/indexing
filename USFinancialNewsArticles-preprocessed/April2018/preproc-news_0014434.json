    "text": "Orlando Arcia delivered the game-winning hit in the ninth inning, and the Milwaukee Brewers knocked off the Chicago Cubs 5-4 on Friday night at Miller Park.\nThe Brewers erased an early two-run deficit behind home runs from Eric Thames and Travis Shaw and then pieced together the winning run in the ninth inning. Manny Pina drew a walk and advanced to third on a Herman Perez infield single and a throwing error by Cubs third baseman Kris Bryant. Arcia followed with a single to right field, plating Pina for the winning run.\nVictor Caratini and Addison Russell had RBI singles in the first inning to give the Cubs an early 2-0 lead. Pitching with the lead, Chicago starter Kyle Hendricks worked out of some mild, early threats, before running into trouble in the fifth inning.\nReliever Josh Hader, who replaced Milwaukee starter Brandon Woodruff, led off the inning with a single and scored on Thames’ homer over the center field wall. Ryan Braun followed with a single and then scored on Shaw’s home run to right field that gave the Brewers a 4-2 lead.\nWoodruff pitched into the fourth inning, allowing two runs on four hits before turning it over to Hader.\nHendricks surrendered four runs on nine hits over five innings for the Cubs.\nChicago first baseman Anthony Rizzo was a late scratch with a lower back strain. Caratini got the start in Rizzo’s place.\nChicago’s Kyle Schwarber struck out four times, including in the ninth inning with runners on first and second base.\nThe Brewers were blanked 7-0 by Jon Lester and the Cubs on Thursday and saw All-Star closer Corey Knebel suffer a hamstring injury that put him on the disabled list and is expected to keep him out at least six weeks.\nYu Darvish will make his second start for the Cubs on Saturday. He surrendered five runs in 4 1/3 innings in his Cubs’ debut last week against the Miami Marlins. The Brewers will counter with Zach Davies.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
