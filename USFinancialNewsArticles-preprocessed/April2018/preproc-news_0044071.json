Grafmyre, CEO of Penns Woods Bancorp, Inc., (NASDAQ:PWOD) has announced that the Company’s Board of Directors has authorized the extension of its repurchase plan. The repurchase plan is for an additional year ending April 30, 2019 and allows for the repurchase of up to 482,000 shares of which approximately 29% has been repurchased to date.\nRepurchases are authorized to be made by the Company from time to time at the prevailing market prices on the open market, in block trades or in privately negotiated transactions as, in management’s opinion, market conditions warrant.
