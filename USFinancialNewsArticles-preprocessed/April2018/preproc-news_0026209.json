    "text": "BERLIN (Reuters) - The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said on Friday that Peru captain Paolo Guerrero and the World Anti-doping Agency (WADA) have filed appeals over the player’s six-month doping ban.\nPeruvian soccer star Paolo Guerrero talks to the press during an event by BCP bank in Lima, Peru February 1, 2018. REUTERS/Mariana Bazo Guerrero had been suspended for a year by world soccer’s governing body FIFA on Dec. 8 after testing positive for cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine after Peru’s 0-0 draw away to Argentina in October.\nFIFA then reduced the ban to six months.\nGuerrero, who has claimed the positive test was due to contamination, is seeking to remove the sanction completely while WADA is demanding a stiffer sentence of up to two years for the doping violation.\nShould WADA win the appeal the player could miss out on the World Cup in Russia in June.\nCAS said a hearing would take place next month.\nPeru, who have qualified for their first World Cup in 36 years, have been drawn in a group with France, Denmark and Australia.\nReporting by Karolos Grohmann; Editing by Peter Rutherford\n ",
