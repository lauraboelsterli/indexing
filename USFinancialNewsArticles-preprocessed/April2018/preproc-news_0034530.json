    "text": "LANCASTER, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Fulton Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:FULT) (“Fulton” or the “Corporation”) reported net income of $49.5 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180417006611/en/\n\"Despite a seasonally weaker first quarter in terms of growth, our financial results benefited from a favorable interest rate environment, stable credit conditions, and a reduction in non-interest expenses,” said E. Philip Wenger, Chairman and CEO. “After declining in 2017, our commercial loan pipeline increased in the first quarter, and with a continued favorable interest rate environment, we remain optimistic that we can create meaningful earnings growth in 2018.”\nNet income per diluted share increased 47.4% in comparison to the $0.19 reported for the fourth quarter of 2017 and 12.0% from the first quarter of 2017. Results for the fourth quarter of 2017 included a $15.6 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, charge for the re-measurement of net deferred tax assets (“Tax Charge”) resulting from the new 21% federal corporate income tax rate established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal average assets for the first quarter of 2018 were $19.9 billion, a decrease of $196.5 million from the fourth quarter of 2017. Average loans, net of unearned income, increased $100.8 million, or 0.6%, in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2017. Average loans and yields, by type, for the first quarter of 2018 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2017 are summarized in the following table:\nThree Months Ended Increase (decrease) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 in Balance Balance Yield (1) Balance Yield (1) $ % (dollars in thousands) Real estate - commercial mortgage $ 6,305,821 4.16 % $ 6,232,674 4.09 % $ 73,147 1.2 % Commercial - industrial, financial and agricultural 4,288,634 4.15 % 4,263,199 4.05 % 25,435 0.6 % Real estate - residential mortgage 1,958,505 3.85 % 1,926,067 3.83 % 32,438 1.7 % Real estate - home equity 1,538,974 4.65 % 1,560,713 4.52 % (21,739 ) (1.4 %) Real estate - construction 984,242 4.22 % 1,004,166 4.27 % (19,924 ) (2.0 %) Consumer 315,927 4.67 % 312,320 4.75 % 3,607 1.2 % Leasing 260,780 4.53 % 253,340 4.48 % 7,440 2.9 % Other 8,149 N/A 7,706 N/A 443 5.7 % Total Average Loans, net of unearned income $ 15,661,032 4.19 % $ 15,560,185 4.14 % $ 100,847 0.6 % (1) Presented on a fully-taxable equivalent basis using a 21% and 35% Federal tax rate and statutory interest expense disallowances for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nTotal average liabilities decreased $184.1 million, or 1.0%, from the fourth quarter of 2017, while average deposits decreased $636.5 million, or 4.0%. Average deposits and interest rates, by type, for the first quarter of 2018 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2017 are summarized in the following table:\nThree Months Ended Decrease March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 in Balance Balance Rate Balance Rate $ % (dollars in thousands) Average Deposits, by type:\nNoninterest-bearing demand $ 4,246,168 - % $ 4,454,456 - % $ (208,288 ) (4.7 %) Interest-bearing demand 3,958,894 0.41 % 4,037,879 0.40 % (78,985 ) (2.0 %) Savings and money market deposits 4,494,445 0.39 % 4,752,337 0.38 % (257,892 ) (5.4 %) Total average demand and savings\n12,699,507 0.27 % 13,244,672 0.26 % (545,165 ) (4.1 %) Brokered deposits 74,026 1.51 % 105,135 1.27 % (31,109 ) (29.6 %) Time deposits 2,646,779 1.20 % 2,706,982 1.18 % (60,203 ) (2.2 %) Total Average Deposits $ 15,420,312 0.43 % $ 16,056,789 0.42 % $ (636,477 ) (4.0 %) Asset Quality\nNon-performing assets were $145.4 million, or 0.73% of total assets, at March 31, 2018, compared to $144.6 million, or 0.72% of total assets, at December 31, 2017 and $143.4 million, or 0.75% of total assets, at March 31, 2017.\nAnnualized net charge-offs for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 were 0.10% of total average loans compared to 0.14% and 0.09% for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, respectively. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of non-performing loans was 131% at March 31, 2018, unchanged from December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, Fulton recorded a $4.0 million provision for credit losses, compared to $6.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNet Interest Income and Margin\nNet interest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $151.3 million, an increase of $1.9 million, or 1.3%, from the fourth quarter of 2017, driven by a six basis point increase in the net interest margin, to 3.35%. The improvement in the net interest margin resulted from a ten basis point increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets outpacing the four basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities.\nNon-interest Income\nNon-interest income in the first quarter of 2018, excluding investment securities gains, was $45.9 million, a decrease of $9.2 million, or 16.7%, in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2017, a $5.1 million net gain was recognized upon the settlement of litigation. For the first quarter of 2018, other service charges and fees decreased $2.4 million, or 17.4%, due primarily to lower commercial loan interest rate swap fees and seasonal decreases in debit card fee income. Gains on sales of Small Business Administration loans and mortgage banking revenues also experienced seasonal declines.\nGains on sales of investment securities for the first quarter of 2018 were $19 thousand, a decrease of $1.9 million in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNon-interest Expense\nNon-interest expense was $136.7 million in the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of $1.8 million, or 1.3%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the amortization of tax credit investments, which decreased $1.7 million, and a $3.4 million write-off of certain accumulated capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2017, non-interest expense increased $3.3 million, or 2.5%, in the first quarter of 2018. This increase was primarily driven by a $2.3 million increase in salaries and benefits expense largely due to seasonal increases in payroll taxes, a $1.2 million increase in professional fees, driven by additional legal fees, a $1.1 million seasonal increase in occupancy expenses resulting from snow removal and utilities costs and approximately $0.8 million related to anticipated branch closure costs, partially offset by a decrease in FDIC insurance expense.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe effective income tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 12.5%, as compared to 44.4% for the fourth quarter of 2017. Excluding the impact of the Tax Charge, the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 would have been 18.9%. Based on the new corporate income tax rate effective January 1, 2018, Fulton’s effective tax rate in 2018 and future years is expected to be substantially lower than in 2017 and in prior years.\nAdditional information on Fulton is available on the Internet at www.fult.com .\nSafe Harbor Statement\nThis news release may contain forward-looking statements with respect to the Corporation’s financial condition, results of operations and business.

The Corporation has presented these non-GAAP financial measures because it believes that these measures provide useful and comparative information to assess trends in the Corporation's results of operations. Presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is consistent with how the Corporation evaluates its performance internally and these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in the Corporation's industry. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, in addition to GAAP measures, are also useful to investors to evaluate the Corporation's results. Investors should recognize that the Corporation's presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures might not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for GAAP basis measures, and the Corporation strongly encourages a review of its condensed consolidated financial statements in their entirety.
