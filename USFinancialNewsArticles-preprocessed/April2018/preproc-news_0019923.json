    "text": "April 13, 2018 / 1:32 AM / Updated an hour ago Comey says in book Trump denied allegations of lewd behaviour - Washington Post Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump denied allegations of lewd behaviour made in an intelligence dossier and asked whether the FBI would consider proving it was a lie, former FBI Director James Comey wrote in an upcoming memoir, according to the Washington Post. FILE PHOTO: Former FBI Director James Comey testifies before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on \"Russian Federation Efforts to Interfere in the 2016 U.S. Elections\" on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 8, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo - RC11985A30D0 \nComey, fired by Trump in May 2017, wrote in “A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership” that Trump raised the dossier with him at least four times during meetings, the Post said. The dossier was compiled by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele about Trump’s ties to Russia, and included an allegation that involved prostitutes. \nThe White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters. Comey’s publicist also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment. \nThe newspaper said it obtained a copy of the 304-page book, scheduled to be released on Tuesday, and that Comey detailed in it his private interactions with Trump. \nComey’s firing led to the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion between Russians and the Trump campaign. \nRussia has denied interfering in the election. Trump has said there was no collusion. Reporting by Eric Beech; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Peter Cooney",
