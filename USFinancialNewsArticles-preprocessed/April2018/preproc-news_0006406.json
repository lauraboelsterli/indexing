(TSX: CJR.B) announced its second quarter financial results today.\n\"This quarter has yielded positive growth in consolidated segment profit and a slight increase in consolidated revenues, with revenue gains in our Radio and Content divisions, and the continued realization of benefits from our new cost structure. Television advertising revenue was lower than the prior year, partly due to the Winter Olympics in the period, though the decline was not as significant as what we reported in the first quarter\", said Doug Murphy, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"We are pleased with this quarter's results and the steady progress we are making against our strategic plan. Moving forward, Corus remains focused on maximizing and monetizing our high-value audiences, and we have a solid roadmap in place to position the organization for success over time within a changing media landscape.\"\nFinancial Highlights\nThree months ended\nSix months ended\nFebruary 28,\nFebruary 28,\n(in thousands of Canadian dollars except per share amounts)\n2018\n2017\n2018\n2017\nRevenues\nTelevision\n336,222\n335,896\n751,686\n761,460\nRadio\n33,243\n32,291\n75,167\n74,708\n369,465\n368,187\n826,853\n836,168\nSegment profit (1)\nTelevision\n103,646\n101,399\n272,248\n285,820\nRadio\n6,883\n6,341\n20,404\n19,627\nCorporate\n2,230\n(5,057)\n(2,006)\n(10,778)\n112,759\n102,683\n290,646\n294,669\nNet income attributable to shareholders\n40,042\n24,881\n117,715\n96,027\nAdjusted net income attributable to shareholders (1) (2)\n41,880\n25,577\n120,765\n106,403\nBasic earnings per share\n$0.19\n$0.12\n$0.57\n$0.48\nAdjusted basic earnings per share (1) (2)\n$0.20\n$0.13\n$0.58\n$0.53\nDiluted earnings per share\n$0.19\n$0.12\n$0.57\n$0.48\nFree cash flow (1)\n82,073\n96,022\n165,288\n129,931\n(1)\nSegment profit, segment profit margin, adjusted net income attributable to shareholders, adjusted basic earnings per share, and free cash flow do not have standardized meanings prescribed by IFRS.

More information can be found on the Corus Entertainment website at www.corusent.com in the Investor Relations section.\nUse of Non-IFRS Financial Measures\nThis press release includes the non-IFRS financial measures of adjusted net income, adjusted basic earnings per share and free cash flow that are not in accordance with, nor an alternate to, generally accepted accounting principles (\"IFRS\") and may be different from non-IFRS measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-IFRS measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.\nNon-IFRS financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. They are limited in value because they exclude charges that have a material effect on the Company's reported results and, therefore, should not be relied upon as the sole financial measures to evaluate the Company's financial results. The non-IFRS financial measures are meant to supplement, and to be viewed in conjunction with, IFRS financial results. A reconciliation of the Company's non-IFRS measures is included in the Company's most recent Report to Shareholders which is available on Corus' website at www.corusent.com as well as on SEDAR.\nCaution Concerning Forward-Looking Information\nThis press release contains forward-looking information and should be read subject to the following cautionary language:\nTo the extent any statements made in this report contain information that is not historical, these statements are forward- looking statements and may be forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws (collectively, \"forward-looking information\"). These forward-looking statements relate to, among other things, our objectives, goals, strategies, intentions, plans, estimates and outlook, including advertising, distribution, merchandise and subscription revenues, operating costs and tariffs, taxes and fees, and can generally be identified by the use of the words such as \"believe\", \"anticipate\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"plan\", \"will\", \"may\" and other similar expressions. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances may be considered forward-looking information. Although Corus believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking information are reasonable, such information involves assumptions and risks and uncertainties and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Certain material factors or assumptions are applied with respect to the forward-looking information, including without limitation, factors and assumptions regarding the general market conditions and general outlook for the industry, interest rates, stability of the advertising, distribution, merchandise and subscription markets, operating and capital costs and tariffs, taxes and fees, our ability to source desirable content and our capital and operating results being consistent with our expectations. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such information. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these expectations include, among other things: our ability to attract and retain advertising revenues; audience acceptance of our television programs and cable networks; our ability to recoup production costs, the availability of tax credits and the existence of co-production treaties; our ability to compete in any of the industries in which we do business; the opportunities (or lack thereof) that may be presented to and pursued by us; conditions in the entertainment, information and communications industries and technological developments therein; changes in laws or regulations or the interpretation or application of those laws and regulations; our ability to integrate and realize anticipated benefits from our acquisitions and to effectively manage our growth; our ability to successfully defend ourselves against litigation matters arising out of the ordinary course of business; and changes in accounting standards. Additional information about these factors and about the material assumptions underlying any forward-looking information may be found under the heading \"Risks and Uncertainties\" in the Management's Discussion and Analysis for the year ended August 31, 2017 and the second quarter ended February 28, 2018 and under the heading \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Information Form.
