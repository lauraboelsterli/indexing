    "text": "George Springer drove in four runs, Carlos Correa belted two home runs and Justin Verlander logged his third scoreless appearance as the Houston Astros extended their winning streak to four games with a 10-0 victory over the host Chicago White Sox on Friday at Guaranteed Rate Field.\nSpringer recorded a pair of two-run doubles, extending a five-run fourth inning with his first double off White Sox right-hander James Shields (1-2) before adding his second against Chicago reliever Danny Farquhar in the sixth. Springer scored on an error by White Sox shortstop Tim Anderson in the fourth after driving in Brian McCann and Marwin Gonzalez with a liner to right.\nAfter scoring one run three times during a six-game stretch, the Astros (14-7) have totaled 30 runs during their winning streak. McCann and Springer scored twice each while Correa added a multi-hit game, finishing 3-for-5 with three RBIs and his third and fourth homers this season.\nVerlander (3-0) allowed just two hits and three walks with five strikeouts over six innings. He faced the minimum through three innings and didn’t yield a baserunner until White Sox second baseman Yoan Moncada walked to lead off the fourth. Verlander, who worked six scoreless innings on Opening Day against the Rangers and tossed seven scoreless at Minnesota on April 9, lowered his ERA to 1.10 while throwing 96 pitches, 62 for strikes.\nShields escaped a bases-loaded jam in the second inning by getting a called third strike on Astros center fielder Derek Fisher. But in the fourth, Yuli Gurriel opened the frame with a double before Alex Bregman followed with a single that snapped the scoreless tie. Shields walked McCann to open the sixth and departed when Fisher added a double. Springer and Correa followed by driving in two runs apiece, with Correa smacking a two-run homer for a 9-0 lead.\nCorrea added a solo shot off Carson Fulmer in the ninth. Joe Smith, Collin McHugh and Ken Giles combined to work three perfect innings as the Astros completed their third shutout.\nFarquhar fainted in the dugout after completing the top of the sixth inning and was attended to by medical personnel and on-site EMTs. The White Sox announced he was conscious as he was transported to Rush University Medical Center, where he will undergo further treatment and testing.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
