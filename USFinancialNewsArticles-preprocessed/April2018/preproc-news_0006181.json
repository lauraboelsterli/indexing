    "text": "March 28, 2018 / 11:14 PM / 6 days ago UK consumers turn more confident in March - GfK Reuters Staff 3   Consumers in Britain were their most confident in 10 months in March, according to a survey which suggested that they took comfort from a fall in inflation and this month’s Brexit transition deal.

REUTERS/Mary Turner \nThe headline gauge of consumer confidence, compiled by market research firm GfK for the European Commission, rose to -7 from -10 in February. \nThe median forecast in a Reuters poll of economists had pointed to another reading of -10. \n“The prospect of wage rises finally outstripping declining inflation, high levels of employment with low-level interest rates, and finally some movement on the Brexit front appear to have boosted our spirits,” Joe Staton, head of experience innovation UK at GfK, said in a statement. \nPrime Minister Theresa May this month secured an outline deal to keep Britain’s access to the European Union’s single market unchanged for 21 months after Brexit in March next year. \nThat political breakthrough was accompanied by economic data that showed a pickup in the pace of wage growth and inflation continuing its fall, having jumped after the Brexit vote.
