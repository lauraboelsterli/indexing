    "text": "A project to stream continues video of Earth from satellites says it just got an influx of money from some of tech's top investors, including SoftBank and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates .\nA company called EarthNow said on Wednesday it plans to use a large constellation of satellites to provide \"live and unfiltered\" footage of almost anywhere on earth, accessible from smartphones and tablets and available for app makers. That's a \"dramatic leap forward\" from today's systems, which transmit video clips at slower speeds, EarthNow said .\nThe footage could be used for projects like tracking illegal fishing , tracking animal migration patterns and monitoring forest fires, EarthNow said.\nThe company, also backed by Airbus, was founded in 2017 and was spun out of Intellectual Ventures, a firm known for its massive patent portfolio .\nSatellites have become a cornerstone of SoftBank's flush Vision Fund, beginning with a 2016 investment in OneWeb, which also backs EarthNow. OneWeb CEO Greg Wyler told CNBC last year that SoftBank CEO and telecom mogul Masayoshi Son had a wide network of existing relationships in the industry.\nThe EarthNow investment round comes amid broader excitement about the space industry in private markets. Elon Musk's SpaceX, for instance, is testing a new internet service through a network of satellites. \nThe Wall Street Journal and GeekWire earlier reported some details of EarthNow's project. Representatives of SoftBank and Bill Gates did not immediately respond to a request to confirm the investment, but Airbus confirmed its role in the round.\nâ€” CNBC's Michael Sheetz contributed to this report.",
