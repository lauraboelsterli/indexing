FILE PHOTO: A woman walks past a logo of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) in Turin March 31, 2014. REUTERS/Giorgio Perottino\nThe worldâ€™s seventh-largest carmaker said net debt fell to 1.3 billion euros (1.13 billion pounds) by the end of March, compared with a forecast of 2.6 billion euros in a Thomson Reuters poll.\nThe Italian-American group ( FCAU.N ) said first-quarter operating profit rose 5 percent to 1.61 billion euros, slightly below an analysts consensus forecast of 1.74 billion euros.\nShares fell immediately after the release but quickly recovered and were up 1.6 percent at 19.44 euros by 1049 GMT.
