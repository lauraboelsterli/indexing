    "text": "NEW YORK, April 26 (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co on Thursday reported a first-quarter profit that exceeded Wall Street estimates on strong demand for its two most important medicines, and the U.S. drugmaker raised its full-year earnings forecast.\nExcluding special items, Bristol-Myers said it earned 94 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 85 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\nThe company said net profit for the quarter slipped to $1.5 billion, or 91 cents per share, from $1.52 billion, or 94 cents a share, a year ago due to expenses associated with a recently-announced collaboration deal.\nBristol-Myers now expects 2018 earnings of $3.35 to $3.45 per share, up from its prior view of $3.15 to $3.30.
