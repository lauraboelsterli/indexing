    "text": "MIAMI, April 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Watsco, Inc. (NYSE:WSO) announced today that it will host a conference call to discuss its 2018 first quarter earnings results on Tuesday, April 24, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. (ET). Prepared remarks regarding the financial and operational results will be followed by a question and answer session with Watsco’s senior management team.\nThe conference call will be web-cast by CCBN's StreetEvents and can be found under the link highlighted on our website at http://www.watsco.com . The earnings results will be released before the market opens on April 24, 2018. A replay of the conference call will be available on our website.\nInvestors and analysts are encouraged to pre-register for the conference call by using the link below. Participants who pre-register will be given a unique PIN to gain immediate access to the call. Pre-registration may be completed at any time up to the call start time.\nTo pre-register, go to:\nhttp://dpregister.com/10119024\nParticipants that would like to join the conference call, but have not pre-registered, can do so by dialing (844) 883-3908 within the United States or (412) 317-9254 internationally and asking for the “Watsco, Inc” call. Please call five to ten minutes prior to the scheduled start time as the number of telephone connections is limited.\nWatsco operates the largest distribution network for heating, air conditioning and refrigeration (HVAC/R) products with locations in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico, and on an export basis to Latin America and the Caribbean. Watsco estimates that over 250,000 contractors and technicians visit or call one of its 560 locations each year to get information, obtain technical support and buy products.\nWatsco has launched a variety of customer-obsessed technologies to transform how HVAC/R contractors and technicians are served in the marketplace. Watsco believes speed, productivity and efficiency will be ever more critical as the digital era progresses and is investing to ensure an unparalleled customer-experience. Proprietary innovations launched by Watsco include:\nMobile apps, websites and e-commerce platforms, incorporating the industry’s most data-rich repository of product information. Business intelligence and data analytics to enable insightful decision-making by 600+ managers. Order fulfillment software to improve speed and convenience of fulfilling nearly 7 million orders. Predictive analytics-driven demand planning and inventory optimization software to improve order fill-rates, increase inventory turns, reduce real estate requirements and improve long-term productivity.\nHVAC/R products provide comfort to homes and businesses regardless of the outdoor climate. There are approximately 92 million central air conditioning and heating systems installed in the United States that have been in service more than 10 years. Older systems often operate below today’s government mandated energy efficiency and environmental standards. Watsco has an opportunity to accelerate the replacement of these systems at a scale greater than its competitors as the movement toward reducing energy consumption and its environmental impact continues. This is especially important since heating and cooling accounts for approximately half of the energy consumed in a typical U.S. home.
