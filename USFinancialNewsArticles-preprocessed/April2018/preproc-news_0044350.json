He didn’t specify which channels it would include or when it would be available. The CEO said he hopes to launch the service in the next few weeks. \nAT&T T, -1.11% is in court to dispute the allegation that it will use its ownership of Time Warner Inc. to hurt pay-TV competition. Unveiling a low-cost plan helps the company’s case. The company has proposed buying Time Warner TWX, -0.54% for $85 billion. ",
