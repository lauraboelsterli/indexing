REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration/File Photo\nThe measures included a rise in the threshold on taxable income for small firms to 1 million yuan from 500,000 yuan and preferential tax deductions for firmsâ€™ purchases of equipment for research and development, it said.\nVenture capital investment and start-up technology firms would also get tax incentives, state radio said.\nLast month, the government unveiled value-added tax cuts amounting to 400 billion yuan, following pledges by Premier Li Keqiang to cut taxes for firms and individuals by more than 800 billion yuan this year.\nThe cabinet also called for banks to strive for a significant cut in financing costs for small firms by the end of September, state radio said.
