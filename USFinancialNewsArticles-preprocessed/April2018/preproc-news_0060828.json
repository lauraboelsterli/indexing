    "text": "April 26, 2018 / 9:51 AM / Updated 12 minutes ago UPDATE 1-Banco Bradesco's results beat forecasts as loan-loss provisions fall Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Adds more details on the results)\nSAO PAULO, Brazil’s Banco Bradesco SA beat analysts’ profit estimates in the first quarter as loan-loss provisions declined, offsetting a decrease in the bank’s loan book.\nThe country’s second largest private lender on Thursday reported a recurring net income, which excludes one-time items, of 5.102 billion reais ($1.46 billion) in the first quarter, above the average of Thomson Reuters analyst consensus of 4.877 billion reais and 9.8 percent higher than from a year earlier.\nBradesco’s recurring return on equity came in at 18.6 percent, below analysts’ estimates of 20.1 percent, but 0.3 percentage points up in the quarter.\nAmid a gradual recovery in the Brazilian economy, loan-loss provisions dropped 26.3 percent from a year earlier, to 3.892 billion reais, which was a bigger drop than analysts had forecast.\nBradesco’s loan book, however, shrank 1.3 percent in the quarter, to 486.6 billion reais, mainly because of a contraction in loans to large companies. In February, Bradesco had set a cautious tone with its guidance for the year, with loan book growth between 3 percent and 7 percent.\nWith lower losses to consumers and small-sized companies, Bradesco’s 90-day default ratio declined 0.3 percent in the quarter, to 4.4 percent.\nBradesco’s profit was also boosted by higher fee revenues and lower administrative expenses.
