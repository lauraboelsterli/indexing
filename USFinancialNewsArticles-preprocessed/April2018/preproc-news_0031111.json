    "text": "ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., April 12, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- New Jersey's legal online gambling industry closed a record-setting quarter with a record-shattering March, continuing to buoy the state's gaming industry, according to PlayNJ.com analysts.\n\"The revenue records grab headlines, but the story doesn't end there,\" said PlayNJ.com lead analyst Steve Ruddock. \"Online gaming is increasingly important to the bottom line of every casino operator in New Jersey. It was a key factor in the gaming industry's 23.7 percent increase in gross operating profit in Q4 2017.\"\nNew Jersey online casinos generated $25.6 million in gross revenue in March, up 16.3 percent percent from February's $21.99 million.\nNew Jersey has now amassed $69.5 million in total revenue this year, up 17.3 percent from $59.3 million in Q1 2017. The three months of 2018 represent the three highest monthly revenue totals since New Jersey legalized and regulated online gambling in 2013.\n\"Online casinos were able to produce another incredible month of revenue as the market for these games continues to grow,\" Ruddock said. \"Few obvious signs of a slow down exist.\"\nBorgata Hotel Casino & Spa became the first first license holder to surpass $200 million in total gaming win ($201.8 million) after generating $4.6 million in March.\nThe Golden Nugget posted a record $8.7 million in March, up 9.8 percent from $7.9 million in February.\n\"The Golden Nugget has become a bellwether for New Jersey. As it goes, so goes the state's legal online gambling industry,\" Ruddock said.\nMore from the March report:\nNew Jersey is on pace to tally $278.1 million this year. The industry generated $825,168 per day in the 31 days of March, up from $785,433 per day in February. New Jersey online casinos paid $4.5 million in taxes to the state in March. Online casino games generated $23.6 million in March; online poker brought in $1.97 million.\nFor more, visit PlayNJ.com .\nAbout The PlayUSA Network:\nThe PlayUSA Network and its state-focused branches (including PlayNJ.com , PlayNY.com , PlayPennsylvania.com , and PlayCA.com ) is a leading source for news, analysis, and research related to the market for regulated online gaming in the U.S.\nContacts:\nZack Hall, DVA Advertising & PR, 541-389-2411, zack@dvaadv.com\nView original content: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-jerseys-legal-online-gambling-industry-obliterates-monthly-revenue-record-with-25-6-million-in-march-300629206.html\nSOURCE PlayNJ.com",
