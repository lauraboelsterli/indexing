    "text": "April 6, 2018 / 11:04 AM / Updated 3 hours ago Vietnam warns against 'inappropriate' statues after nude sculpture cover-up Mai Nguyen 3 Min Read \nHANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam’s culture ministry has issued a directive against “inappropriate” statues after images of godlike sculptures with animal heads and human genitalia stoked controversy.

REUTERS/Kham \nThe statues on display at a holiday resort in the city of Hai Phong, have had their offending parts modestly covered up with bikinis and other swim wear, but that has only added to the interest in them. \n“We actually didn’t want to cover the statues because it’s art, but we wanted to show that we listen,” said Nguyen Trung Thanh, vice director of the Hon Dau International Tourism Company, which owns the statues. \nDespite sweeping economic reforms and increasing openness toward social change and ubiquitous internet fare, Communist-ruled Vietnam maintains a conservative attitude towards sex and nudity. \nThe cover-up the offending bits of the statues attracted even more attention with pictures of the more modest displays going viral online.

REUTERS/Kham \nOne male statue with a horse’s head had been dressed in what appeared to be a red miniskirt. Another, with a goat’s head, had been clad a tight pair of green swimming briefs. \n“We covered them up, but only the parts of the body people find offensive,” Thanh told Reuters by telephone. \n“They’re supposed to be naked”.
