The amount of speculators' bearish, or short, positions in 10-year Treasury futures exceeded bullish, or long, positions by 330,635 contracts on April 10, according to the CFTC's latest Commitments of Traders data. A week earlier, speculators held 375,365 net short positions in 10-year T-note futures. Meanwhile, speculative net short positions in five-year T-note futures retreated to 520,483 contracts from an all-time high amount of 579,306 contracts a week earlier. Speculators' net shorts in Eurodollar futures set another record peak at 4.018 million contracts on Tuesday. Speculative net shorts in two-year T-notes declined to 81,805 contracts, the lowest level in nine months.
