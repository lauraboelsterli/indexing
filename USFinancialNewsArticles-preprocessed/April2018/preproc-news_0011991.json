    "text": "PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Regulatory News:\nMauna Kea Technologies (Paris:MKEA) (OTCQX:MKEAY) (Euronext: MKEA, OTCQX: MKEAY) inventor of Cellvizio®, the multidisciplinary probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE) platform, has appointed Christophe Lamboeuf, to the position of Chief Financial Officer. Christophe Lamboeuf succeeds Olivier Regnard, who is pursuing another opportunity in a different industry. In his role, Christophe Lamboeuf will be responsible for finance, HR, IT and operations departments.\nChristophe Lamboeuf has more than 25 years of experience in financial management and executive positions in France and abroad, acquired while working for General Electric, Ricoh, CS Telecom and Toshiba. Before joining Mauna Kea, Christophe Lamboeuf served as the Chief Financial Officer and Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Intrasense, a French publicly-traded company developing a medical imaging visualization and analysis software suite. He was involved in a number of capital raises following the company’s initial public offering in 2012. Christophe is a chartered accountant and holds an advanced degree (DESS) in Finance from the IAE Graduate School of Management and a Master in Economics.\n“Christophe brings a track record of strong accomplishments from his previous experience which spans from roles with emerging healthcare technology companies to large global industrial conglomerates,” said Sacha Loiseau, Ph.D., CEO and co-founder of Mauna Kea Technologies. “His experience with public, growth-oriented companies will be a strong asset to the company as we focus on growing our business in our key U.S. and China markets. I want to thank Olivier for his impressive contribution to Mauna Kea during his tenure. I am glad he was able to work hand in hand with Christophe during a transition period and I wish him the best in his future endeavors.”\nChristophe Lamboeuf said, “Mauna Kea’s Cellvizio platform has the potential to significantly improve patient care by providing information that will assist physicians in the diagnosis of a variety of diseases. I look forward to working with the management team to grow the business in its current key markets.”\nAbout Mauna Kea Technologies\nMauna Kea Technologies is a global medical device company focused on eliminating uncertainties related to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer and other diseases thanks to real time in vivo microscopic visualization.
