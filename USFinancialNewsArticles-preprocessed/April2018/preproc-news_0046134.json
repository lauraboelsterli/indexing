U.S. stocks saw their worst day in two-and-a-half weeks, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average extending losses for a fifth day after U.S. treasury yields crossed the 3 percent mark. In Southeast Asia, Singapore stocks fell to their lowest in a week, shedding 0.6 percent, as financials and industrials weighed. Keppel Corporation slipped 3 percent while lender DBS Group Holdings shed 0.8 percent. \"The near 2 percent decline in Dow has spilled over into Singapore,\" said an analyst who did not wish to be named. Indonesian shares were headed for a fourth straight session of loss as financials and consumer staples fell. Unilever Indonesia, down as much as 4 percent, was the biggest loser on the index. The country's index of 45 most liquid stocks was down 1.4 percent. Malaysian stocks fell 0.7 percent as financials weighed while energy stocks dragged Thailand 0.3 percent lower. Philippine shares were trading flat as losses in industrial stocks offset gains in financial and real estate stocks. Bank of the Philippine Islands gained 1.6 percent while International Container Terminal Services plunged over 4 percent to its lowest in over one year. Vietnam was closed for a holiday.
