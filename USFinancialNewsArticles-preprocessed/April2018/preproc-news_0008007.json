    "text": "April 4 (Reuters) - Graphite electrode maker GrafTech International Ltd said on Wednesday it could raise up to $907 million (C$1.16 billion) in what could be the largest initial public offering in the steel sector in a decade.\nThe offering of 37.8 million shares is expected to be priced between $21 and $24 per share, the company said. ( https://bit.ly/2q99r3s )\nThe shares are being offered by GrafTech's sole shareholder - an affiliate of Brookfield Business Partners LP, a unit of Brookfield Asset Management Inc.\nThe asset manager bought Ohio-based GrafTech in 2015, when the steel industry was struggling with a slump in prices due to record exports by China.\nGrafTech makes graphite electrode products used in electric arc furnaces to make steel and other ferrous and non-ferrous metals.\nThe company reported net sales of $550.8 million for 2017, up from $438 million a year earlier. The company swung to a profit of $8 million in 2017, compared with a loss of $235.8 million in 2016.\nGrafTech intends to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol \"EAF\", the company said.\nJ.P.Morgan and Credit Suisse are among lead underwriters of the offering.\n($1 = 1.2827 Canadian dollars) (Reporting by Nikhil Subba in Bengaluru Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",
