See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" for further details.\nIncome Statement\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income was $14.8 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $2.6 million, or 21.1%, compared to $12.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase in net interest income was largely attributable to growth in average interest earning assets, which increased by 24.1% to $1.61 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2018, from $1.30 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2017. This increase in our average interest earning assets was due to continued organic growth in our loan portfolio.\nNet interest margin (on a fully tax-equivalent basis) for the first quarter of 2018 was 3.77% compared to 3.97% for the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of 20 basis points. While net interest margin has benefitted from the repricing of variable-rate loans and the origination of new loans at higher rates, this was offset by increased balances and rates on non-core deposits and borrowings. Furthermore, the lower statutory federal tax rate reduced the tax equivalent adjustment by seven basis points.\nInterest income on interest earning assets increased $3.8 million, or 25.2%, to $19.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $15.1 million for the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to the increases in average balances on loans. The yield on interest earning assets rose to 4.76% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 4.72% in the first quarter of 2017.\nInterest expense on interest bearing liabilities increased $1.5 million, to $3.9 million for the first quarter of 2018, as compared to $2.4 million for the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to increases in average balances of both deposits and borrowings. The cost of interest bearing liabilities increased to 1.37% in the first quarter of 2018 from 1.08% in the first quarter of 2017 due to higher costs and average balances of non-core interest bearing deposits and the issuance of subordinated debt that occurred in the third quarter of 2017.\nA summary of the Company’s average balances, interest income and expense, and net interest margin for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\nConsolidated Average Balances, Interest Yields and Rates (Unaudited)\nFor the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 March 31, 2017 Average Interest Yield/ Average Interest Yield/ Balance & Fees Rate Balance & Fees Rate (dollars in thousands) Interest Earning Assets: Cash Investments $ 21,693 $ 49 0.92 % $ 19,014 $ 33 0.70 % Investment Securities: Taxable Investment Securities 119,218 633 2.15 96,587 374 1.57 Tax-Exempt Investment Securities (1) 114,828 1,183 4.18 130,230 1,516 4.72 Total Securities 234,046 1,816 3.15 226,817 1,890 3.38 Loans (2) 1,353,031 17,048 5.11 1,051,058 13,192 5.09 Federal Home Loan Bank Stock 5,393 45 3.38 4,170 28 2.72 Total Interest Earning Assets 1,614,163 18,958 4.76 1,301,059 15,143 4.72 % Noninterest Earning Assets 11,586 10,999 Total Assets $ 1,625,749 $ 1,312,058 Interest Bearing Liabilities: Interest Bearing Transaction Deposits 168,509 113 0.27 % 127,346 77 0.25 % Savings and Money Market Deposits 354,009 756 0.87 251,027 418 0.68 Time Deposits 298,333 1,223 1.66 278,864 1,017 1.48 Brokered Deposits 211,058 917 1.76 153,412 506 1.34 Federal Funds Purchased 28,511 118 1.68 22,956 49 0.87 Notes Payable 16,500 152 3.74 18,500 167 3.66 FHLB Advances 68,278 299 1.78 53,000 187 1.43 Subordinated Debentures 24,544 369 6.10 — — — Total Interest Bearing Liabilities 1,169,742 3,947 1.37 % 905,105 2,421 1.08 % Noninterest Bearing Liabilities: Noninterest Bearing Transaction Deposits 295,587 286,833 Other Noninterest Bearing Liabilities 11,102 1,250 Total Noninterest Bearing Liabilities 306,689 288,083 Shareholders' Equity 149,318 118,870 Total Liabilities and Shareholders' Equity $ 1,625,749 $ 1,312,058 Net Interest Income/ Interest Rate Spread 15,011 3.39 % 12,722 3.64 % Net Interest Margin (3) 3.77 % 3.97 % Taxable Equivalent Adjustment: Tax-Exempt Investment Securities (248 ) (531 ) Net Interest Income $ 14,763 $ 12,191 (1) Interest income and average rates for tax-exempt investment securities are presented on a tax-equivalent basis, assuming a statutory federal income tax rate of 21% in 2018 and 35% in 2017. (2) Average loan balances include nonaccrual loans. Interest income on loans includes amortization of deferred loan fees, net of deferred loan costs. (3)\nNet tax-equivalent interest margin during the periods presented represents: (i) the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and the interest expense on interest bearing liabilities, divided by (ii) average interest earning assets for the period.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe provision for loan losses was $600,000 for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of $350,000 compared to the provision for loan losses of $950,000 for the first quarter of 2017. The provision decreased in the first quarter of 2018 due largely to lower net charge-offs and overall improvement in asset quality, coupled with moderate loan growth in comparison to the first quarter of 2017.\nA reconciliation of the Company’s allowance for loan losses for the first quarters of 2018 and 2017 is as follows:\n(dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 Balance at January 1, $ 16,502 $ 12,333 Provision for Loan Losses 600 950 Charge-offs (12 ) (80 ) Recoveries 31 13 Balance at March 31, $ 17,121 $ 13,216 Noninterest Income and Expense\nNoninterest income was $387,000 for the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of $93,000 from $480,000 for the first quarter of 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower gains on sales of available for sale securities and foreclosed assets.\nNoninterest expense was $6.5 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $1.3 million, or 24.3% from $5.3 million for the first quarter of 2017. The increase was primarily driven by a $1.2 million increase in salaries and employee benefits as the result of merit increases and increased staff to meet the needs of the Company’s growing infrastructure.\nThe following table presents the major components of noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2018, compared to the first quarter of 2017:\nThree Months Ended March 31, Increase/ (dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 (Decrease) Noninterest Expense: Salaries and Employee Benefits $ 4,318 $ 3,168 $ 1,150 Occupancy and Equipment 574 549 25 FDIC Insurance Assessment 270 255 15 Data Processing 32 194 (162 ) Professional and Consulting Fees 301 228 73 Information Technology and Telecommunications 183 167 16 Marketing and Advertising 284 254 30 Intangible Asset Amortization 48 48 — Other Expense 522 391 131 Totals $ 6,532 $ 5,254 $ 1,278 Full-time equivalent employees increased from 101 at the end of the first quarter of 2017 to 118 at the end of the first quarter of 2018. Despite increased overhead, as well as higher operating costs associated with the IPO, the Company experienced only a marginal increase in the efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure. The efficiency ratio was 42.8% for the first quarter of 2018, compared to 41.2% for the first quarter of 2017.\nIncome Taxes\nThe effective combined federal and state income tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 25.8% as compared to 36.9% for the first quarter of 2017. The lower effective combined rate is primarily due to the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets at March 31, 2018 were $1.68 billion, up from $1.62 billion at December 31, 2017, and a 24.2% increase from $1.35 billion at March 31, 2017. The increase in total assets was primarily due to organic loan growth.\nTotal gross loans at March 31, 2018 were $1.41 billion, an increase of $58.3 million, or 4.3%, over total gross loans of $1.34 billion at December 31, 2017, and an increase of $320.7 million, or 29.6%, over total gross loans of $1.08 billion at March 31, 2017.\nThe following table details dollar composition and percentage composition of the Company’s loan portfolio, by category, at the dates indicated:\nMarch 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent (dollars in thousands) Commercial and Industrial $ 199,262 14.18 % $ 217,753 16.16 % $ 140,753 12.98 % Construction and Land Development 147,842 10.52 130,586 9.69 113,381 10.45 Real Estate Mortgage: 1 - 4 Family Mortgage 200,573 14.27 195,707 14.53 181,920 16.77 Multifamily 332,770 23.68 317,872 23.60 253,665 23.38 CRE Owner Occupied 67,512 4.80 65,909 4.89 62,867 5.80 CRE Nonowner Occupied 453,498 32.27 415,034 30.81 327,903 30.23 Total Real Estate Mortgage Loans 1,054,353 75.02 994,522 73.83 826,355 76.18 Consumer and Other 3,963 0.28 4,252 0.32 4,263 0.39 Total Loans, Gross 1,405,420 100.00 % 1,347,113 100.00 % 1,084,752 100.00 % Allowance for Loan Losses (17,121 ) (16,502 ) (13,216 ) Net Deferred Loan Fees (4,130 ) (4,104 ) (3,494 ) Total Loans, Net $ 1,384,169 $ 1,326,507 $ 1,068,042 Total deposits at March 31, 2018 were $1.35 billion, an increase of $13.7 million, or 1.0%, over total deposits of $1.34 billion at December 31, 2017, and an increase of $211.2 million, or 18.5%, over total deposits of $1.14 billion at March 31, 2017. Noninterest bearing deposits were $315.0 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $292.5 million at December 31, 2017, and $322.6 million at March 31, 2017. Noninterest bearing deposits comprised 23.3% of total deposits at March 31, 2018, compared to 21.8% at December 31, 2017, and 28.2% at March 31, 2017. Interest bearing deposits were $1.04 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $1.05 billion at December 31, 2017, and $819.3 million at March 31, 2017. Interest bearing deposits comprised 76.7% of total deposits at March 31, 2018, compared to 78.3% at December 31, 2017, and 71.8% at March 31, 2017.\nShareholders’ equity at March 31, 2018 was $199.0 million, an increase of $61.9 million, or 45.1%, over shareholders’ equity of $137.2 million at December 31, 2017, and an increase of $78.3 million, or 64.8%, over shareholders’ equity of $120.7 million at March 31, 2017. The increase in both periods was primarily due to capital raised in the initial public offering and net income for the respective periods.\nAsset Quality\nAsset quality metrics remained strong at March 31, 2018. Annualized net charge-offs as a percent of average loans for the first quarter of 2018 were (0.01%) (a net recovery), compared to 0.00% for the fourth quarter of 2017, and 0.03% for the first quarter of 2017. At March 31, 2018, the Company’s nonperforming assets, which include nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned, were $1.4 million, 0.08% of total assets, as compared to $1.7 million, 0.11% of total assets, at December 31, 2017, and $5.0 million, 0.37% of total assets, at March 31, 2017.\nAbout the Company\nBridgewater Bancshares, Inc. is a financial holding company headquartered in Bloomington, Minnesota.
