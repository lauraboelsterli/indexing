    "text": "JACKSONVILLE, Fla., April 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) today announced record first quarter 2018 net earnings of $695 million, or $0.78 per share, versus $362 million, or $0.39 per share in the same period last year. CSX’s operating ratio for the quarter improved 950 basis points to 63.7 percent from 73.2 percent in the prior year. Compared to 2017 first quarter adjusted operating results, which excluded restructuring charges, this represents an operating ratio improvement of 570 basis points and a 53 percent increase in earnings per share year over year.\n“CSX employees did a great job of running the railroad and executing the scheduled railroading model during challenging weather conditions,” said James M. Foote, president and chief executive officer. “We’re more confident in our ability to deliver safe, reliable, best-in-class service for our customers and enhanced value for our shareholders.”\nRevenue for the first quarter remained relatively flat at $2.88 billion, while expenses declined 13 percent year over year or 8 percent when excluding prior year restructuring charges. Operating income for the quarter increased 36 percent to $1.04 billion when compared to $769 million in the same period last year or 19 percent when compared to the adjusted operating income of $879 million reported in the first quarter of 2017.\n“Since implementation of scheduled railroading began in March 2017, CSX has taken significant strides to transform the organization and to make CSX more competitive,” said Foote. “Our company’s operating model provides substantial opportunities to leverage our service product offering, capture growth and deliver superior financial returns.”\nCSX executives will conduct a conference call with the investment community this afternoon, April 17, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Investors, media and the public may listen to the conference call by dialing 1-888-EARN-CSX (888-327-6279) and asking for the CSX earnings call. Callers outside the U.S., dial 1-773-756-0199. Participants should dial in 10 minutes prior to the call. In conjunction with the call, a live webcast will be accessible and presentation materials will be posted on the company's website at http://investors.csx.com . Following the earnings call, an internet replay of the presentation will be archived on the company website.\nThis earnings announcement, as well as additional detailed financial information, is contained in the CSX Quarterly Financial Report available through the company’s website at http://investors.csx.com and on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAbout CSX and its Disclosures\nCSX, based in Jacksonville, Florida, is a premier transportation company. It provides rail, intermodal and rail-to-truck transload services and solutions to customers across a broad array of markets, including energy, industrial, construction, agricultural, and consumer products. For over 190 years, CSX has played a critical role in the nation's economic expansion and industrial development.

CSX also uses social media channels to communicate information about the company. Although social media channels are not intended to be the primary method of disclosure for material information, it is possible that certain information CSX posts on social media could be deemed to be material. Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, and others interested in the company to review the information we post on Twitter ( http://twitter.com/CSX ) and on Slideshare ( http://www.slideshare.net/HowTomorrowMoves ). The social media channels used by CSX may be updated from time to time.\nMore information about CSX Corporation and its subsidiaries is available at www.csx.com and on Facebook ( http://www.facebook.com/OfficialCSX ).\nNon-GAAP Disclosure\nCSX reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). CSX also uses certain non-GAAP measures that fall within the meaning of Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation G and Regulation S-K Item 10(e), which may provide users of the financial information with additional meaningful comparison to prior reported results. Non-GAAP measures do not have standardized definitions and are not defined by U.S. GAAP. Therefore, CSX’s non-GAAP measures are unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The presentation of these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or as superior to the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to corresponding GAAP measures are above.\nForward-looking Statements\nThis information and other statements by the company may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act with respect to, among other items: projections and estimates of earnings, revenues, margins, volumes, rates, cost-savings, expenses, taxes, liquidity, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases or other financial items, statements of management's plans, strategies and objectives for future operations, and management's expectations as to future performance and operations and the time by which objectives will be achieved, statements concerning proposed new services, and statements regarding future economic, industry or market conditions or performance. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words or phrases such as “will,” “should,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “project,” “estimate,” “preliminary” and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement. If the company updates any forward-looking statement, no inference should be drawn that the company will make additional updates with respect to that statement or any other forward-looking statements.\nForward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual performance or results could differ materially from that anticipated by any forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by any forward- looking statements include, among others; (i) the company's success in implementing its financial and operational initiatives; (ii) changes in domestic or international economic, political or business conditions, including those affecting the transportation industry (such as the impact of industry competition, conditions, performance and consolidation); (iii) legislative or regulatory changes; (iv) the inherent business risks associated with safety and security; (v) the outcome of claims and litigation involving or affecting the company; (vi) natural events such as severe weather conditions or pandemic health crises; and (vii) the inherent uncertainty associated with projecting economic and business conditions.\nOther important assumptions and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are specified in the company's SEC reports, accessible on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and the company's website at www.csx.com .\nContacts: Kevin Boone, Investor Relations 904-359-1090 Bryan Tucker, Corporate Communications 855-955-6397\nSource:CSX Corporation",
