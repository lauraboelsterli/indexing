REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo\nSales in the beverage unit, which also makes Lipton tea and Mountain Dew, fell 1 percent, but were still an improvement over the past two quarters when they decreased at least 3 percent.\nPepsi and rival Coca-Cola ( KO.N ) are adding teas and coffees to their offerings and launching low and no-calorie versions of their marquee sodas to counter a switch to healthier drinks by consumers.\n“Although we continued to face challenges in North America Beverages, the sector had sequential improvement in top line momentum since the fourth quarter of 2017,” Chief Executive Officer Indra Nooyi said in a statement.\nPepsi is also concentrating on its other big business - snacking - by innovating with new flavors and packaging designs.\nSales at Pepsi’s Frito-Lay division, its biggest unit that makes Lay’s potato chips and Doritos tortilla chips, rose 3.4 percent in the first quarter.\nThe company said its snacks unit had strong performance with a 3 percent organic revenue growth. Organic revenue excludes benefits from divestitures and acquisitions.\nPepsiCo’s net income rose to $1.34 billion, or 94 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 24, from $1.32 billion, or 91 cents per share, a year earlier.\nExcluding items, Pepsi earned 96 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S\nTotal revenue rose 4.3 percent to $12.56 billion, topping analysts’ estimate of $12.40 billion.\nSales in Latin America, Europe and Sub Saharan Africa rose 14 percent and 15 percent, respectively. Sales in Asia, Middle East and North Africa rose 7 percent. Reporting by Nivedita Balu and Siddharth Cavale in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila",
