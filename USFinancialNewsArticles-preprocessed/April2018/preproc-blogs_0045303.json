    "text": "0 COMMENTS Photo: Reuters \nThe grilling of Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg by Congress last week has prompted organizations to revisit their data-usage policies and take a closer look at how they communicate with customers and constituents.\nThe increased focus on data privacy following the Facebook hearings increases scrutiny surrounding “what information we collect, how secure that information is, and who we share it with,” said Ted Ross, chief information officer for the City of Los Angeles.\nIndividuals increasingly are concerned about the privacy of their personal data. A poll of 10,000 consumers released Monday by International Business Machines Corp. and the Harris Poll found that 78% of U.S. respondents say a company’s ability to keep their data private is extremely important, and only 20% completely trust organizations they interact with to maintain the privacy of their data. The survey found that 60% are more concerned about cybersecurity than a potential war, according to IBM.\nLos Angeles CIO Ted Ross Photo: CITY OF LOS ANGELES \nPeople “are looking for a social contract in which they understand how data is captured and what permissions exist,” Mr. Ross said. Organizations should work toward a plan in which “gone are the days of the extremely complicated usage agreements.”\nTodd Thibodeaux, president and chief executive of IT trade group CompTIA, said the Facebook hearings highlighted a trend already in motion toward greater consumer control and transparency by any business that collects user data.\nFor example, new rules under Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation , set to be enforced as of May 25, hold businesses and government entities more accountable for how they use, store and share information about European customers and employees.\n“I would be very surprised if we see anything even remotely as comprehensive as the EU’s GDPR come out of the hearings,” Mr. Thibodeaux said. “But they have highlighted the need for more clarity and control for consumers to decide what they choose to share with providers of platforms and services.”\nGarrett Bekker, an IT security analyst at 451 Research, said there is a chance the hearings may spark legislation similar to GDPR in the U.S. At the same time, consumers are likely to be “asking more questions about internet applications,” he added.\nFor R “Ray” Wang, principle analyst and founder of Constellation Research Inc., the Facebook hearings highlight the need for enterprise data-use policies that are transparent, explainable, reversible, trainable and human-led.\n“Algorithms, attributes and correlations should be open to inspection for all participants,” Mr. Wang said. “Humans should be able to understand how AI systems come to their contextual decisions, organizations must be able to reverse the learnings and adjust as needed, and all decisions should begin and end with human decision points,” he added.\nEfforts to explain how complex algorithms reach conclusions are already underway at government agencies such as the research arm of the U.S. Department of Defense and companies such as Capital One Financial Corp. \nIn Los Angeles, Mr. Ross said the Facebook discussions have reinforced the need to be up front with residents about how their data is collected and used, and making sure data-protection policies are enforced when building new IT architectures or implementing new services.\nWhen communicating with customers, it’s important to use plain, simple language, with examples, and to state those messages multiple times. Messages should be translated into other languages, and any targeted communications should have clear opt-out options.\n“There’s a very thin line between great digital engagement and being creepy,” Mr. Ross said. “Both companies and government are working to make sure we fall on the engaging side.”\nSara Castellanos contributed to this story. \nShare this: CYBERSECURITY DATA ANALYTICS DATA PRIVACY FACEBOOK TED ROSS Previous The Morning Download: Companies Should Beware Public’s Rising Anxiety Over Data",
