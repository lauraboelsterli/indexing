    "text": "April 4, 2018 / 1:01 PM / Updated 6 minutes ago TREASURIES-Yields fall as trade war fears boosts demand for bonds Reuters Staff \n* Trade war concerns adds safety bid for bonds \n* Friday’s employment report in focus \nBy Karen Brettell \nNEW YORK, April 4 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury prices gained on Wednesday on safety buying after China retaliated against the Trump administration’s plan to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, hurting stock prices. \nChina hit back with a list of similar duties on key U.S. imports including soybeans, planes, cars, beef and chemicals. \nBenchmark 10-year note prices gained 5/32 in price to yield 2.726 percent, down from 2.783 percent on Tuesday. \n“It’s about the trade war and the breakdown in equities,” said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York. \nThis week’s major economic catalyst will be Friday’s closely watched jobs report, which will be evaluated for accelerating jobs gains and wage pressures. \nThe U.S. economy added the biggest number of jobs in more than 1-1/2 years in February, at 313,000 jobs. \nMarch’s numbers may not be as bullish for the economy, however. \n“Data for March has a very strong tendency to disappoint,” Lyngen said. \nIf jobs gains or wages come in below consensus on Friday 10-year yields may fall back below the 2.70 percent area to around 2.65 percent, Lyngen said. \nThe yields have been range-bound between 2.70 percent and 2.80 percent for the past week. \nThe ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday showed employers adding 241,000 jobs in March. \nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is also due to speak about the economic outlook at an event in Chicago on Friday.
