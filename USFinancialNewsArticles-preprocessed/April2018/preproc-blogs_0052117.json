Learn more at momath.org .\n****\nAnswers\nIn Sevens and Elevens , Edward has a 7 on his hat. In Three-Digit Squares , Bob’s digit is a 4. Alice and Carl can have (1,4), (1,8) or (4,8) on their hats, in either order.\nSee MoMath’s website for extended solutions.\nShare this: Previous Twin-Speak (Thursday Crossword, April 26) Next Let's Split The Last One (Crossword Contest, April 27)",
