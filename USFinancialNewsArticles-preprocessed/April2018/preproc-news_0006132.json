A man stands at the Air France desk at Nice airport as Air France pilots, cabin and ground crews unions call for a one-day strike over salaries in France, March 30, 2018. REUTERS/Eric Gaillard \nThe SNPL, SPAF and Alter unions said in a statement they were planning the new strike after management refused to consider their requests for higher wages in recent talks. \nAir France management has said that the unions’ demands for a six percent wage increase could jeopardise its growth plans. The airline was hit by a series of strikes in March. Reporting by Leigh Thomas; Editing by Andrew Roche",
