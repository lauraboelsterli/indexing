    "text": "NEW DELHI, April 11 (Reuters) - Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zangeneh said on Wednesday that $60 a barrel is a good price for oil currently as the market should avoid volatility.\n\"I believe in this situation around 60 (dollars per barrel) is a good price,\" said Zangeneh, who was attending the International Energy Forum.\n\"I think we should look at the market not for short-term, long-term, mid-term is important for us,\" he said. \"It is very important for producers and consumers not to have volatility in the market.\"\nWhen asked if global benchmark Brent oil trading at $70 a barrel were too high, Zangeneh answered, \"Yes.\"\nZangeneh added that he hopes India and Iran can finalise the main issue on the development of the Farzad B natural gas field in the next two months.
