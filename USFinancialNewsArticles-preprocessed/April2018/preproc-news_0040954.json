    "text": "CHARLOTTE, N.C., April 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Signicast , a Form Technologies company, has signed an agreement to acquire Consolidated Casting Corporation, an investment casting company in Hutchins, Texas. Consolidated Casting will become the first Signicast location outside of Wisconsin.\n\"The addition of Consolidated Casting extends our footprint in the United States, expands our services to the oil & gas sector, and provides added capacity for existing and new markets. We are excited to have the Consolidated Casting employees join our division,\" says Clayton Tychkowsky, CEO Signicast Division.\nConsolidated Casting is a great fit for Signicast and the Form Technologies platform as they are equally customer focused and employee driven. Their current facility also provides further opportunity for future Signicast growth and expansion. Additionally, the acquisition gives current Consolidated Casting customers access to the entire Form Technologies platform of precision manufacturers including, Signicast, Dynacast, and OptiMIM. The transition will ensure every customer receives not only the stability of the Form business but knowledgeable insight and expertise during each stage of the design and manufacturing process.\nAbout Signicast\nFor over 50 years, Signicast has helped leading manufacturers overcome their most pressing commercial challenges.
