    "text": "April 7, 2018 / 7:09 AM / Updated 2 hours ago CORRECTED-HIGHLIGHTS-Rugby-Super Rugby week eight \n(Clarifies Rebels are leaders not Brumbies in fourth para) \nApril 7 (Reuters) - Super Rugby highlights from week eight: SUNWOLVES 29 WARATAHS 50 \nNew South Wales Waratahs defeated the Sunwolves 50-29 in a try-fest at Tokyo’s Prince Chichibu Memorial Stadium on Saturday as the Japanese side fell well short in their latest bid for a first Super Rugby win of the campaign. \nOn a chilly afternoon in the Japanese capital, the Sunwolves were let down by errors all over the park as they failed to keep pace with the Waratahs and maintained their unwanted record of never having beaten an Australian side in Super Rugby. \nDespite an up-tempo game plan from Jamie Joseph’s men, the superior quality of the Australians showed as two tries from scrum half Jake Gordon gave the Waratahs a 38-17 lead following a first half that contained seven tries. \nFour more tries followed in the second half and, despite a yellow card for captain Michael Hooper with 16 minutes remaining, the Waratahs ran out comfortable winners, closing the gap on the conference leading Melbourne Rebels to one point.
