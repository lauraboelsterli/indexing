    "text": "Sotera Health committed to Safeguarding Global Health™ with Nordion's increased focus on global gamma technologies business\nBROADVIEW HEIGHTS, Ohio, April 17, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Sotera Health LLC, the world's leading, fully integrated protector of global health, today announced that it has entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement to sell the Medical Isotopes segment of its Nordion business to a subsidiary of BWX Technologies, Inc. (BWXT). This transaction will create a platform that will accelerate growth for both companies.\n\"The world's need for gamma technology has expanded dramatically as the demand for sterilization of medical and non-medical applications has accelerated in response to increasing global regulatory demands and growing healthcare needs,\" said Michael Petras, Chief Executive Officer of Sotera Health. \"The sale will enable BWXT to enter the medical isotope field with highly skilled employees and specialized facilities that are recognized as the best in the business.
