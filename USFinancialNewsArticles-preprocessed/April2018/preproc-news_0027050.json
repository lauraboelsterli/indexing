    "text": "Ian Kinsler’s eighth inning sacrifice fly scored Shohei Ohtani with the go-ahead run as the Los Angeles Angels edged by the Kansas City Royals 5-4 on Friday night at Kauffman Stadium.\nKinsler had three hits and scored a pair of runs. Albert Pujols homered and drove in three runs.\nReliever Justin Grimm (0-2) took the loss, surrendering two runs on three hits, a sacrifice fly and sacrifice bunt. Former Kansas City reliever Blake Wood (1-0) picked up the win.\nPujols belted a first-pitch, two-run homer in the third inning with Kinsler aboard. Both have local connections. Pujols grew up in the Kansas City area, attending Fort Osage High School and Maple Woods Community College. Kinsler is a Missouri alumnus.\nThe Royals got a run back in bottom of the inning when Whit Merrifield’s two-out single scored Alcides Escobar, who led off the inning with a double.\nThe Royals scored three runs in the fourth, one unearned, to seize a 4-2 lead. Cam Gallagher dumped a single into shallow left that scored Lucas Duda, while Paulo Orlando came home on an Andrelton Simmons throwing error. Orlando singled home Jorge Soler, who had started things off with a double, with the first run of the inning.\nAngels left-hander Andrew Heaney, who was making his first start of the season after having Tommy John surgery last year, allowed four runs, one unearned, on seven hits over five innings to take the loss.\nRoyals right-hander Jason Hammel yielded the two runs on Pujols’ homer and eight hits over 5 1/3 innings. He walked none and struck out four.\nThe Royals loaded the bases in the sixth but failed to score. Gallagher struck out and Abraham Almonte grounded out to strand the runners.\nThe Angels cut the lead to 4-3 in the seventh when Pujols’ two-out single scored Kinsler.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
