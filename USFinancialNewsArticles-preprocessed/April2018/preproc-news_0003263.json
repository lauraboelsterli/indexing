    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, April 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Via OTC PR Wire -- Amarantus Bioscience Holdings, Inc. (OTCPink:AMBS) (the \"Company\" or AMBS), a US-based JLABS-alumnus biotechnology holding company, developing first-in-class orphan neurologic, regenerative medicine and ophthalmic therapies through its subsidiaries, today announced the temporary relocation of its headquarters from San Francisco, CA to the WeWork location at 110 Wall St. in New York, NY. The temporary relocation reflects management's commitment to completing its previously announced capital restructuring, as well as the raising of independent funding for its subsidiaries.\n\"The New York life sciences community is vibrant, and its financial community has grown more familiar with the biopharma holding company business model,\" said Gerald E. Commissiong, President & CEO of Amarantus. \"With the recent completion of the Tender Exchange , Amarantus is now positioned, from a capital structure standpoint, to unlock the tremendous value inherent in the Company's subsidiaries. The WeWork facilities provide us with everything we need to continue the execution of the Company's reorganization effort in New York City.\"\nAbout Amarantus Bioscience Holdings, Inc.\nAmarantus Bioscience Holdings ( AMBS ), a JLABS alumnus company, is a biotechnology company developing treatments and diagnostics for diseases in the areas of neurology, regenerative medicine and orphan diseases through its subsidiaries. AMBS' wholly-owned subsidiary Elto Pharma, Inc. has development rights to eltoprazine, a Phase 2b-ready small molecule indicated for Parkinson's disease levodopa-induced dyskinesia, Alzheimer's aggression and adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, commonly known as ADHD. AMBS acquired the rights to the Engineered Skin Substitute program, a regenerative medicine-based approach for treating severe burns with full-thickness autologous skin grown in tissue culture that is being pursued by AMBS' wholly-owned subsidiary Cutanogen Corporation. AMBS' wholly-owned subsidiary MANF Therapeutics, Inc. owns key intellectual property rights and licenses from a number of prominent universities related to the development of the therapeutic protein known as mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (\"MANF\"). MANF Therapeutics, Inc. is developing MANF-based products as treatments for brain and ophthalmic disorders. MANF was discovered by the Company's Chief Scientific Officer John Commissiong, PhD. Dr. Commissiong discovered MANF from AMBS' proprietary discovery engine PhenoGuard. AMBS also owns approximately 79.25 million shares of Avant Diagnostics, Inc. (OTCPink:AVDX) via the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary Amarantus Diagnostics, Inc. that occurred in May 2016.\nFor further information please visit www.Amarantus.com , or connect with the Amarantus on Facebook , LinkedIn , Twitter and Google+ .\nAbout Elto Pharma, Inc.\nElto Pharma, Inc. is developing Eltoprazine, an oral small molecule 5HT1A/1B partial agonist in clinical development for the treatment of Parkinson's disease levodopa-induced dyskinesia (PD-LID), Alzheimer's aggression and adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adult ADHD). Eltoprazine has been evaluated in over 680 human subjects to date, and has a well-established safety profile, with statistically significant efficacy results across multiple central nervous system indications. Eltoprazine has received orphan drug designation (ODD) from the US FDA for the treatment of PD-LID.\nEltoprazine was originally developed by Solvay (now Abbvie) in aggression-related indications. The eltoprazine program was out-licensed to PsychoGenics, Inc. (PGI). PGI licensed eltoprazine to Amarantus in 2014 after a successful proof-of-concept trial in PD-LID.\nIn April 2017, Amarantus incorporated the wholly-owned subsidiary Elto Pharma, Inc. for the purpose of raising capital to finance the further clinical development of Eltoprazine.\nAbout Cutanogen Corporation\nEngineered Skin Substitute (ESS) is a tissue-engineered skin prepared from autologous (patient's own) skin cells. It is a combination of cultured epithelium and a collagen-dermal fibroblast implant that produces a skin substitute which contains both epidermal and dermal components. This model has been shown in preclinical studies to generate a functional skin barrier. Most importantly, because ESS is composed of a patient's own cells, it is less likely to be rejected by the immune system of the patient, unlike with porcine or cadaver grafts in which immune system rejection is a possibility. A non-GMP version ESS has been used in investigator-initiated and compassionate-use clinical settings in over 150 human subjects, primarily pediatric patients, for the treatment of severe burns up to 95% of total body surface area. The non-GMP version has also been used in the treatment of two patients with Giant Congenital Melanocytic Nevi (GCMN).\nIn July 2015, Amarantus' acquired Lonza Walkersville's wholly-owned subsidiary Cutanogen Corporation, the sole licensor of intellectual property rights to ESS from Cincinnati's Shriner's Hospital for Children and the University of Cincinnati. Cutanogen Corporation is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amarantus.\nAbout MANF Therapeutics, Inc.\nMANF (mesencephalic-astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor) is believed to have broad potential because it is a naturally-occurring protein produced by the body to reduce/prevent apoptosis (cell death) in response to injury or disease, via the unfolded protein response. By administering exogenously produced MANF the body, Amarantus is seeking to use a regenerative medicine approach to assist the body with higher quantities of MANF when needed. Amarantus is the frontrunner and primary holder of intellectual property around MANF, and is initially focusing on the development of MANF-based protein therapeutics.\nIn April 2017, Amarantus incorporated the wholly-owned subsidiary MANF Therapeutics, Inc. to focus on the preclinical and clinical development of MANF. MANF's lead indication is retinitis pigmentosa, and additional indications including Parkinson's disease, diabetes and Wolfram's syndrome are envisioned. Further applications for MANF may include Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain injury, myocardial infarction, antibiotic-induced ototoxicity and certain other orphan diseases.\nForward-Looking Statements\nCertain statements, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking statements.
