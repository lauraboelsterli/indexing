Total distance: 308.238km (57 laps) \n2017 pole: Valtteri Bottas (Finland) Mercedes. One minute 28.769 seconds. \n2017 winner: Sebastian Vettel (Germany) Ferrari. \nRace lap record: 1:31.447. Pedro de la Rosa (Spain), McLaren, 2005. \nStart time: 1510GMT (1810 local) RACE WINS \nHamilton has 62 victories from 209 races and is second in the all-time list behind seven-times world champion Michael Schumacher (91). Vettel has 48. \nFerrari have won 230 races since 1950, McLaren 182, Williams 114, Mercedes 76 and Red Bull 55. Former champions McLaren and Williams have not won since 2012. POLE POSITION \nHamilton has a record 73 career poles. Vettel has 50. \nMax Verstappen, at 20 years old, can become the youngest ever pole sitter this season. The current youngest is Vettel, who did it at the age of 21. PODIUM \nHamilton has 118 career podiums and is second on the all-time list behind Schumacher (155). Vettel has 100, Raikkonen 92. POINTS \nHamilton now has 26 scoring finishes in a row and can equal Kimi Raikkonen’s all-time record of 27. \nFour drivers on the grid have yet to score points in their F1 careers: Rookies Charles Leclerc (Sauber) and Sergey Sirotkin(Williams) and the Toro Rosso pair of Brendon Hartley and Pierre Gasly. \nSauber’s Marcus Ericsson last scored a point in 2015. BAHRAIN \nVettel and McLaren’s Fernando Alonso have won three times in Bahrain, Hamilton twice. \nThis year’s race is the 14th edition. The grand prix was first held in 2004 and not run in 2011 due to civil unrest. It switched to a floodlit event in 2014. \nThe driver on pole in Bahrain has been the winner in five of the 13 races to date. It has never been won by anyone starting below the front two rows. \nEleven out of 13 winners have been from the team that ended up winning the constructors’ title that season. The exceptions were Alonso for Ferrari in 2010 and Vettel in 2017. MILESTONE \nIn winning in Australia, Vettel became only the third driver to lead 3,000 laps in his career. The others are Schumacher and Hamilton. He also took his 100th podium. \nVettel is set to make his 200th start (from 201 races). (Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Amlan Chakraborty)",
