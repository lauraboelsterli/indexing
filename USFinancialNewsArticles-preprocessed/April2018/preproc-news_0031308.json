    "text": "NEWTON, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tremont Mortgage Trust (Nasdaq: TRMT) today announced the closing of an $18.1 million first mortgage bridge loan to finance the acquisition of an 184,000 square foot, 14-story office tower located in Metairie, Louisiana.\nThis floating rate loan includes initial funding of approximately $15.8 million and an as-is LTV ratio of approximately 80%. This loan also includes future funding allowance of $2.3 million for tenant improvements, leasing commissions, marketing and capital expenditures. The loan has a three-year initial term and two one-year extension options.\n“The execution of this acquisition bridge loan underscores the opportunity we see for TRMT to provide debt capital for owners of middle market and transitional commercial real estate,” said David Blackman, Chief Executive Officer of TRMT. “We ultimately expect to leverage this loan with borrowings under our repurchase facility, creating additional capacity for loan originations.”\nTremont Mortgage Trust (Nasdaq: TRMT) is a real estate finance company that focuses primarily on originating and investing in first mortgage loans secured by middle market and transitional commercial real estate. Tremont Mortgage Trust is managed by Tremont Realty Advisors LLC, an SEC registered investment adviser, which is an indirect subsidiary of The RMR Group Inc.\nWARNING CONCERNING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nTHIS PRESS RELEASE CONTAINS STATEMENTS THAT CONSTITUTE FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 AND OTHER SECURITIES LAWS.
