    "text": "LONDON, April 9 (Reuters) - The cost of insuring exposure to Russian debt jumped 17 basis points (bps) on Monday, the biggest one-day move since September 2016, after fresh sanctions were imposed by the United States targeting Russian companies and their owners.\nRussian five-year credit default swaps (CDS) leapt from Fridayâ€™s close of 121 bps to 138 bps, according to IHS Markit data, levels not seen since mid-November.\nThe average yield spread of Russian sovereign bonds over safe haven U.S. Treasuries on the JPMorgan EMBI Global Diversified index also widened by 21 bps to 206 bps.
