We have good visibility in our portfolio,” the group, which makes chocolate and cocoa products for big food groups such as Nestle and Mondelez, said in a statement on Wednesday.\nChocolate makers have been grappling with sluggish global chocolate demand, but Barry Callebaut has so far bucked the trend by relying on outsourcing contracts and a thriving ‘gourmet’ business with chefs and pastry makers.\nSales volumes increased 8.0 percent in the first half of Barry Callebaut’s fiscal year 2017/18, ahead of the average 7.2 percent rise forecast in a Reuters poll, helped by a strong performance in Europe and accelerating growth in the Americas.\nNet profit jumped 33 percent to 173 million Swiss francs ($180.9 million) on a recurring basis, helped in part by lower net finance costs. The figure was also slightly better than the 171 million estimate in the poll.\n$1 = 0.9561 Swiss francs Reporting by Silke Koltrowitz; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri\n ",
