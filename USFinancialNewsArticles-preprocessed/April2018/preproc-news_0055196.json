    "text": "VANCOUVER, April 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - GOLDCORP INC. (TSX: G, NYSE: GG) (\"Goldcorp\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to report its first quarter 2018 results.\nFirst Quarter Highlights\nNet earnings were $67 million, or $0.08 per share, compared to net earnings of $170 million, or $0.20 per share, for the first quarter of 2017. Operating cash flows for the first quarter of 2018 were $271 million compared to $227 million for the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted operating cash flows (1) were $350 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $315 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nGold production of 590,000 ounces at all-in sustaining costs (1) (\"AISC\") of $810 per ounce, compared to 655,000 ounces at AISC of $800 per ounce for the first quarter of 2017 . Full year 2018 guidance reconfirmed for gold production of 2.5 million ounces (+/-5%) at AISC of $800 per ounce (+/-5%).\nSolid execution on project pipeline in support of the Company's 20/20/20 growth plan. The Peñasquito Pyrite Leach project advanced to 86% completion, ahead of schedule, the Musselwhite Materials Handling project advanced to 65% completion, on schedule and 10% below budget and the Borden project is on track for commercial production by the second half of 2019.\nKey milestone achieved with the completion of the pre-feasibility study at NuevaUnión and advancement to the feasibility stage. The pre-feasibility study outlines a combined and phased approach to the development of the Relincho and La Fortuna deposits at NuevaUnión with a project containing 8.9 million ounces of proven and probable gold mineral reserves and 17.9 billion pounds of proven and probable copper mineral reserves (100% basis) to be produced over a 36 year mine life. The NuevaUnión project is foundational to the Company's Beyond 20/20 program and its feasibility study is expected in 2019.\nProgram to implement $250 million of sustainable annual efficiencies by the middle of 2018 is on track with $210 million achieved as at the end of the first quarter of 2018 across the Company's portfolio. More than 100% of the $250 million of efficiencies have been identified, with the program likely to be extended and the efficiency target increased, after the Company achieves its current target.\n\"Our operations again delivered on target quarterly results while we continue to execute very well on our robust pipeline of growth projects, which together with excellent exploration results from across our portfolio, continues to enhance confidence in our 20/20/20 plan of growing production and reserves by 20%, and reducing AISC by 20% by 2021,\" said David Garofalo, President and Chief Executive Officer of Goldcorp. \"The completion of a solid pre-feasibility study at NuevaUnión and the acceleration of study work, exploration and engineering at Century and Norte Abierto underpin our Beyond 20/20 pipeline of potential new long-life, low-cost and large-scale mines.\"\nFINANCIAL AND OPERATING RESULTS\n($ millions, except where indicated)\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, 2018\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, 2017\nGold production (1) (ounces)\n590,000\n655,000\nGold sales (1) (ounces)\n585,000\n646,000\nOperating cash flows\n$271\n$227\nAdjusted operating cash flows (1),(2)\n$350\n$315\nNet earnings\n$67\n$170\nNet earnings per share\n$0.08\n$0.20\nBy-product cash costs (1),(3) (per ounce)\n$511\n$540\nAISC (1),(3) (per ounce)\n$810\n$800\nNet earnings and net earnings per share for the first quarter of 2018 were affected by, among other things, the following non-cash or other items that management believes are not reflective of the performance of the underlying operations (items are denoted as having (increased)/decreased net earnings and net earnings per share in the three months ended March 31, 2018):\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, 2018\n($ millions,\nafter tax)\n$/share\nReduction in Goldcorp's share of Pueblo Viejo's earnings relating to\nsettlement of a Dominican Republic tax audit\n$17\n$0.02\nNon-cash foreign exchange gain on deferred tax balances\n($16)\n($0.02)\nPlease refer to the Company's financial statements, related notes and accompanying Management's Discussion and Analysis for a full review of its operations and projects.

Attributable performance measures include the Company's mining operations and projects\nand the Company's share from Pueblo Viejo, Alumbrera, Leagold and NuevaUnión.\n2.\nAdjusted operating cash flows comprises Goldcorp's share of operating cash flows before working capital changes, calculated on an\nattributable basis to include the Company's share of Pueblo Viejo, Alumbrera, Leagold and NuevaUnión's operating cash flows before\nworking capital changes. The Company believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, the\nCompany and certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to operate without reliance\non additional external funding or use of available cash.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated financial statements to\nGoldcorp's share of adjusted operating cash flows:\nThree months ended\nMarch 31\n($ millions)\n2018\n2017\nNet cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations\n$271\n$227\nChange in working capital\n8\n23\nAdjusted operating cash flows provided by Pueblo Viejo, Alumbrera and Leagold\n71\n65\nGoldcorp's share of adjusted operating cash flows\n$350\n$315\n3.\n\"Cash costs: by product\" per ounce and \"AISC\" per ounce are non-GAAP financial performance measures.\nCash costs: by-product:\nTotal cash costs: by-product incorporate Goldcorp's share of all production costs, including adjustments to inventory carrying values, adjusted for changes in estimates in reclamation and closure costs at the Company's closed mines which are non-cash in nature, and include Goldcorp's share of by-product silver, lead, zinc and copper credits, and treatment and refining charges included within revenue. Additionally, cash costs are adjusted for realized gains and losses arising on the Company's commodity and foreign currency contracts which the Company enters into to mitigate its exposure to fluctuations in by-product metal prices, heating oil prices and foreign exchange rates, which may impact the Company's operating costs.\nIn addition to conventional measures, the Company assesses this per ounce measure in a manner that isolates the impacts of gold production volumes, the by-product credits, and operating costs fluctuations such that the non-controllable and controllable variability is independently addressed. The Company uses total cash costs: by product per gold ounce to monitor its operating performance internally, including operating cash costs, as well as in its assessment of potential development projects and acquisition targets. The Company believes this measure provides investors and analysts with useful information about the Company's underlying cash costs of operations and the impact of by-product credits on the Company's cost structure and is a relevant metric used to understand the Company's operating profitability and ability to generate cash flow. When deriving the production costs associated with an ounce of gold, the Company includes by-product credits as the Company considers that the cost to produce the gold is reduced as a result of the by-product sales incidental to the gold production process, thereby allowing the Company's management and other stakeholders to assess the net costs of gold production.\nThe Company reports total cash costs: by-product on a gold ounces sold basis. In the gold mining industry, this is a common performance measure but does not have any standardized meaning. The Company follows the recommendations of the Gold Institute Production Cost Standard. The Gold Institute, which ceased operations in 2002, was a non-regulatory body and represented a global group of producers of gold and gold products. The production cost standard developed by the Gold Institute remains the generally accepted standard of reporting cash costs of production by gold mining companies.\nAISC:\nAISC include total production cash costs incurred at the Company's mining operations, which forms the basis of the Company's by-product cash costs. Additionally, the Company includes sustaining capital expenditures, corporate administrative expense, mine-site exploration and evaluation costs, and reclamation cost accretion and amortization. The measure seeks to reflect the full cost of gold production from current operations, therefore expansionary capital and non-sustaining expenditures are excluded. Certain other cash expenditures, including tax payments, dividends and financing costs are also excluded.\nThe Company believes that this measure represents the total costs of producing gold from current operations, and provides the Company and other stakeholders of the Company with additional information of the Company's operational performance and ability to generate cash flows. AISC, as a key performance measure, allows the Company to assess its ability to support capital expenditures and to sustain future production from the generation of operating cash flows. This information provides management with the ability to more actively manage capital programs and to make more prudent capital investment decisions.\nThe Company reports AISC on a gold ounces sold basis. This performance measure was adopted as a result of an initiative undertaken within the gold mining industry; however, this performance measure has no standardized meaning and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company follows the guidance note released by the World Gold Council, which became effective January 1, 2014. The World Gold Council is a non-regulatory market development organization for the gold industry whose members comprise global senior gold mining companies.\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of total cash costs: by product to reported production costs:\nThree months ended March 31, 2018\n($ millions unless stated otherwise)\nProduction\ncosts (a)\nBy-Product\nCredits\nTreatment and\nRefining Charges\non Concentrate\nSales\nOther\nTotal Cash\nCosts: by-\nproduct\nOunces\n(000's)\nTotal Cash Costs:\nby-product per\nounce (b)(c)\nTotal before\nassociates and joint\nventure\n$\n464\n$\n(246)\n$\n23\n$\n(6)\n$\n235\n466\n$\n505\nAssociates and joint\nventure\n$\n86\n$\n(23)\n$\n1\n$\n-\n$\n64\n119\n$\n536\nTotal - Attributable\n$\n550\n$\n(269)\n$\n24\n$\n(6)\n$\n299\n585\n$\n511\nThree months ended March 31, 2017\n($ millions unless stated otherwise)\nProduction\ncosts (a)\nBy-Product\nCredits\nTreatment and\nRefining Charges\non Concentrate\nSales\nOther\nTotal Cash\nCosts: by-\nproduct\nOunces\n(000's)\nTotal Cash Costs:\nby-product per\nounce (b)(c)\nTotal before\nassociates and joint\nventure\n$\n520\n$\n(263)\n$\n45\n$\n-\n$\n302\n539\n$\n561\nAssociates and joint\nventure\n$\n76\n$\n(32)\n$\n3\n$\n-\n$\n47\n107\n$\n436\nTotal - Attributable\n$\n596\n$\n(295)\n$\n48\n$\n-\n$\n349\n646\n$\n540\n(a)\nProduction costs includes $16 million in royalties for the three months ended March 31, 2018 (three months ended March 31, 2017– $23\nmillion).\n(b)\nTotal cash costs: by-product per ounce may not calculate based on amounts presented in these tables due to rounding.\n(c)\nIf silver, copper, lead and zinc were treated as co-products, total cash costs for the three months ended March 31, 2018 would have been\n$696 per ounce of gold (three months ended March 31, 2017 – $701).\nAs described above, AISC include total production cash costs incurred at the Company's mining operations, which forms the basis of the Company's cash costs: by-product and which are reconciled to reported production costs in the tables above.
