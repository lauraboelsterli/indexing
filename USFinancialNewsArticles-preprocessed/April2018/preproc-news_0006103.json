    "text": "SINGAPORE, April 3 (Reuters) - Two Singaporean Airbnb hosts who pleaded guilty in court to unauthorised short-term letting were fined a total of S$60,000 each on Tuesday, in the first such cases under the city-state’s rules on short-term property letting introduced last year.\nThe two men were charged for letting four units in a condominium for less than six months without permission from the Urban Redevelopment Authority.\nThey faced a fine of up to S$200,000 per offence under Singapore law.\nProsecutors sought fines of S$20,000 per charge for a total of S$80,000 for each of the two defendants. Defence lawyers sought fines of S$5,000 per charge.\nPrivate homes in Singapore are subject to a minimum rental period of three consecutive months, while for public housing, home to about 80 percent of Singapore’s residents, it is six months.
