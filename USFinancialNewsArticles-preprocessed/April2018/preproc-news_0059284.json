Same-store sales increased 8% on top of 13% in the comparable period last year. Income before taxes increased over 84% to $7.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 from $4.2 million for the same quarter last year. Net income rose 125% to $6.2 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to net income of $2.7 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for the comparable quarter last year. Net income in the quarter ended March 31, 2018 benefitted from certain tax credits that represented approximately $380,000, or $0.02 per diluted share.\nRevenue increased approximately 8% to $507.5 million for the six months ended March 31, 2018 compared with $471.9 million for the comparable period last year. Same-store sales grew approximately 4% on top of 20% growth for the comparable period last year. Income before taxes increased approximately 64% to $14.3 million for the six-months ended March 31, 2018 from $8.7 million for the same period last year.

Net income in the first half of 2018 benefitted from certain tax credits that represented approximately $380,000, or $0.02 per diluted share.\nWilliam H. McGill, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer stated, “A combination of strong unit growth and constant focus on our higher margin businesses enabled our team to drive meaningful year-over-year gross margin and earnings per share improvement. As our industry continues to recover, the environment for capturing additional product margins remains encouraging. Our 8% same-store sales growth was driven by increased traffic at boat shows, online and in our stores, as demand was aided by strong consumer confidence. Our team executed well by controlling costs in the quarter, which allowed for strong flow-through, despite an unusual increase in health insurance claims in the quarter.”\nMr. McGill continued, “New, innovative models from our manufacturing partners are continuing to be well received and are helping to drive demand from existing boaters as well as those new to boating, as evidenced by our growing backlog. MarineMax remains well positioned to build on its industry leading share position as we enter the height of the boating season. Through continuing to deliver our customers the highest level of service, providing a broad array of new products and working to ensure that each boating experience is maximized, MarineMax will remain the retailer of choice for years to come.”\n2018 Guidance\nBased on current business conditions, retail trends, it’s most recent results and other factors, the Company is again raising its annual fiscal 2018 expectations for fully taxed earnings per diluted share to range from $1.44 to $1.50 versus prior expectations ranging from $1.30 to $1.40. These expectations do not take into account, or give effect for future material acquisitions that may be completed by the Company during the fiscal year or other unforeseen events.\nAbout MarineMax\nHeadquartered in Clearwater, Florida, MarineMax is the nation’s largest recreational boat and yacht retailer.
