    "text": "THE WOODLANDS, Texas, April 19, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Apergy Corporation (\"Apergy\") today announced the pricing of a $300,000,000 offering of senior notes due 2026 (the \"Notes\"), in connection with the previously announced spin-off of Apergy from Dover Corporation (\"Dover\"). The Notes will carry an interest rate of 6.375% and will mature on May 1, 2026. The closing of the offering is expected to occur on May 3, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nApergy intends to use the net proceeds from the offering, together with borrowings under the new term loan facility that Apergy anticipates entering into in connection with the spin-off, to fund a cash payment to Dover and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the spin-off. Pending completion of the spin-off, which is expected to occur on or about May 9, 2018, the proceeds of the offering will be deposited into escrow for the benefit of the holders of the Notes.\nThe Notes are being offered for sale to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in an offering exempt from registration pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), and to certain persons outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nThe Notes and the related guarantees have not been registered under the Securities Act, or the laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state or other jurisdictions' securities laws. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the Notes or any other securities.\nCautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Language\nThis press release includes \"forward-looking statements\" under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
