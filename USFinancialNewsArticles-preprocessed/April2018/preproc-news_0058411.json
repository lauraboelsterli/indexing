    "text": "MADRID, April 25 (Reuters) - Spanish telecoms firm Telefonica on Thursday posted a 3.9 percent fall in first quarter core profit from a year earlier, in line with analyst expectations, as improvements in the domestic market were offset by currency pressures.\nOperating income before depreciation and amortisation (Oibda) was 3.864 billion euros ($4.70 billion) while net profit was 837 million euros compared to 779 million euros a year earlier. ($1 = 0.8214 euros) (Reporting by Julien Toyer ; Editing by Paul Day)\n ",
