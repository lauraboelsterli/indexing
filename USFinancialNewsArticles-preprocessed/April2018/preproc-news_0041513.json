    "text": "BANGKOK, April 20 (Reuters) - Thai police on Friday arrested a German man accused of making a bomb threat on a Nok Airlines plane bound for Bangkok, the airline said.\nThe man, who was not named, was arrested after he claimed he was carrying an explosive device in his carry-on baggage on the plane from Loei province in the northeast to Bangkok.\nThe man made the claim before the plane took off, the airline said in a statement.\nPolice have not confirmed whether the bomb threat was fake or real.\nBudget carrier Nok Air, a subsidiary of Thai Airways , said Flight DD 9705 carrying 83 passengers and five crew took off as scheduled after the man was arrested.
