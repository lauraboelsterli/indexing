FILE PHOTO - May 9, 2017; New York, NY, USA; New York Rangers head coach Alain Vigneault looks on against the Ottawa Senators during the third period in game six of the second round of the 2017 Stanley Cup Playoffs at Madison Square Garden. Mandatory Credit: Adam Hunger-USA TODAY Sports \nThe decision was revealed following the teamâ€™s 5-0 season-ending loss to the Philadelphia Flyers. \nThe Rangers finished dead last in the Metropolitan Division, with just 77 points, and will be an observer of the post-season for the first time since the 2009-10 campaign. \nVigneault spent five seasons at the helm, compiling a 226-147-37 record in the regular season with a playoff record of 31-30. \nThe 56-year-old Vigneault took the Rangers to the Stanley Cup season during his first season in New York in 2013-14. \nThe team lost to the Los Angeles Kings in five games.
