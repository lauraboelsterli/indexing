    "text": "April 19 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue on Thursday, boosted by strong sales in its beauty, and fabric and homecare businesses.\nEarlier in the day, P&G agreed to buy the consumer health business of Merck KGaA for about 3.4 billion euros ($4.2 billion), giving its vitamin brands such as Seven Seas and greater exposure to Latin American and Asian markets.\nNet income attributable to the company fell to $2.51 billion, or 95 cents per share, in the third quarter ended March 31, compared with $2.52 billion, or 93 cents per share, a year earlier.\nNet sales for the world’s largest consumer products maker by market value rose 4.3 percent to $16.28 billion, compared to analysts’ estimate of $16.21 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
