    "text": "HUDSON, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Adaptive Corporation has acquired the Dassault Systèmes software sales and support business division of NobleTek.\nAdaptive , recently named a platinum reseller in the Dassault Systèmes Value Solutions channel, will provide current NobleTek customers with access to, and support for, the broad Dassault portfolio of simulation and PLM software.\n“NobleTek has customers across North America just like we do,” said Adaptive CEO Eric Doubell. “This acquisition allows us to increase our penetration in many areas and assures current NobleTek customers that we have a presence where they exist.”\nNobleTek customers will also now have access to a broader segment of the Dassault Systèmes portfolio as well as laser scanning, metrology and 3D-printing products, added Doubell. “Adaptive’s significant experience with SIMULIA, ENOVIA, and the 3D EXPERIENCE platform, coupled with our Additive Manufacturing and Quality offerings, will enable us to provide more value to the NobleTek customer base,” he said.\nNobleTek president and COO Kurt Jauert said his company will be concentrating on its rapidly expanding Engineering Services business. “We’ve had a lot of success over the past two years in this area,” said Jauert. “Our focus is on NC programming, composites manufacturing and 3D design for major OEMs and Tier Ones in the aerospace industry.”\nWhy did NobleTek choose Adaptive to take on its sales and support business? “We’ve known about Adaptive for a long time, are impressed with their people, and have always heard good things about them,” said Jauert. “We wanted to choose an organization who we felt was the strongest partner in the Dassault channel because not only are our clients becoming their customers, we will also be their customer for our own Dassault product needs.”\nAbout Adaptive Corporation\nAdaptive Corporation is the leading Digital to Physical Product Lifecycle Company that helps streamline business processes, reduce costs and improve efficiencies for customers who need to bring new products to market.
