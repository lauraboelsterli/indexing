    "text": " 28 p.m. ET Share \nAssurance clears path for meeting between Trump, Kim Jong Un KCNA via Reuters North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspects an army facility in 2017. \nBy Michael R. Gordon Jonathan Cheng \nNorth Korea has told the U.S. that Kim Jong Un is prepared to discuss the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, clearing the way for a summit meeting between the North Korean leader and President Donald Trump, according to U.S. officials. \nU.S. officials didn’t say when and how that assurance was delivered, but U.S. and North Korean officials have been in communication. \n“The U.S. has confirmed that Kim Jong Un is willing to discuss the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” a   official said on Sunday. \nHopes for a breakthrough that might end more than six decades of animosity on the Korean Peninsula were raised last month when South Korean national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, told the White House that North Korea was prepared to engage in talks on denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and would refrain from nuclear and missile tests.",
