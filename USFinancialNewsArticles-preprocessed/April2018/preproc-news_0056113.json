    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco today announced that its net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $81 million, compared with net income of $148 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nThe $67 million decrease in net income relative to the prior-year period primarily reflected a decline in other income, primarily related to net gains on settlements related to the Bank’s private-label residential mortgage-backed securities (PLRMBS). In the first quarter of 2017, the Bank recognized a gain on settlements of $119 million (after netting certain legal fees and expenses) relating to the Bank's PLRMBS litigation. The Bank had no settlement gains in the first quarter of 2018. This reduction in net income was partially offset by a $30 million decrease in the expense associated with voluntary charitable contributions for the Quality Jobs Fund, from $40 million in the first quarter of 2017 to $10 million in the first quarter of 2018. In addition, net interest income related to higher average balances of interest-earning assets increased by $14 million in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the prior-year period.\nTotal assets decreased $14.2 billion during the first three months of 2018, to $109.2 billion at March 31, 2018, from $123.4 billion at December 31, 2017. Total advances decreased $10.8 billion, to $66.6 billion at March 31, 2018, from $77.4 billion at December 31, 2017. In addition, investments decreased $3.8 billion, to $39.8 billion at March 31, 2018, from $43.6 billion at December 31, 2017, primarily reflecting a decrease of $5.5 billion in securities purchased under agreements to resell, partially offset by an increase of $2.9 billion in Federal funds sold.\nAccumulated other comprehensive income increased by $17 million during the first three months of 2018, to $335 million at March 31, 2018, from $318 million at December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of improvement in the fair value of PLRMBS classified as available-for-sale.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Bank was in compliance with all of its regulatory capital requirements. The Bank’s total regulatory capital ratio was 6.1%, exceeding the 4.0% requirement. The Bank had $6.7 billion in permanent capital, exceeding its risk-based capital requirement of $2.0 billion. Total retained earnings as of March 31, 2018, were $3.3 billion.\nToday, the Bank’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend on the capital stock outstanding during the first quarter of 2018 at an annualized rate of 7.00%. The quarterly dividend rate is consistent with the Bank's dividend philosophy of endeavoring to pay a quarterly dividend at a rate between 5% and 7% annualized. The quarterly dividend will total $63 million, including $5 million in dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock that will be reflected as interest expense in the second quarter of 2018. The Bank expects to pay the dividend on May 14, 2018.\nFinancial Highlights\n(Unaudited)\n(Dollars in millions)\nSelected Balance Sheet Items\nat Period End Mar. 31, 2018 Dec. 31, 2017 Total Assets $109,225 $123,385 Advances 66,642 77,382 Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio, Net 2,376 2,076 Investments 1 39,832 43,570 Consolidated Obligations: Bonds 74,297 85,063 Discount Notes 27,203 30,440 Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock 309 309 Capital Stock - Class B - Putable 3,068 3,243 Unrestricted Retained Earnings 2 2,681 2,670 Restricted Retained Earnings 2 592 575 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) 335 318 Total Capital 6,676 6,806 Selected Other Data at Period End Mar. 31, 2018 Dec. 31, 2017 Regulatory Capital Ratio 3 6.09 % 5.51 %\nThree Months Ended Selected Operating Results for the Period Mar. 31, 2018 Mar. 31, 2017 Net Interest Income $148 $134 Other Income/(Loss) (8) 112 Other Expense 49 80 Affordable Housing Program Assessment 10 18 Net Income $81 $148 Selected Other Data for the Period Net Interest Margin 4 0.47 % 0.58 % Operating Expenses as a Percent of Average Assets 0.11 0.14 Return on Average Assets 0.26 0.63 Return on Average Equity 4.74 10.59 Annualized Dividend Rate 5 7.00 9.08 Average Equity to Average Assets Ratio 5.40 5.97 Investments consist of Federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits, trading securities, available-for-sale securities, held-to-maturity securities, and securities purchased under agreements to resell. In July 2017, the Bank’s Board of Directors approved the transfer of all amounts classified as restricted retained earnings, other than the amounts related to the Joint Capital Enhancement Agreement, to unrestricted retained earnings. This ratio is calculated as regulatory capital divided by total assets. Regulatory capital includes retained earnings, Class B capital stock, and mandatorily redeemable capital stock (which is classified as a liability), but excludes accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Total regulatory capital as of March 31, 2018, was $6.7 billion. Net interest margin is net interest income (annualized) divided by average interest-earning assets. Dividend rates reflect the dividends declared, recorded, and paid during the relevant periods.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco\nThe Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco delivers low-cost funding and other services that help member financial institutions make home mortgage loans to people of all income levels and provide credit that supports neighborhoods and communities.
