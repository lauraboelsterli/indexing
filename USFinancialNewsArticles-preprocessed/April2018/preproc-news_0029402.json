( MSMY ), an innovator in social commerce platforms, announced today that it has appointed Greg Remsen as the Executive Vice President of Marketing and Government Relations.\nMr. Remsen brings more than 20 years of experience building and developing companies, both public and private, who has successfully taken several disruptive products and technologies to market. “Having successfully supported the capitalization of public companies and existing financial and government relationships, we feel that Greg is a perfect fit for representing our company not only to other business but also to government agencies that want us to produce and distribute content”, said MSMY CEO John Stippick.\nGreg Remsen is a seasoned financial services executive who has worked in the investment and portfolio management industry since 2003. Mr. Remsen founded Remken Financial Corporation, an investment and portfolio management firm in Orange, California that sourced Capitol Market investors, and partnered them with established portfolio managers. Later, Mr. Remsen became the account portfolio manager at Steinberg & Harris, LLC, Newport Beach, California, where here he grew investor portfolios from inception to over $25 million under management. Due to synergistic approach to investment strategies and acquisitions, Mr. Remsen was able to leverage experience and partnerships to multiply investor wealth to over $270 million.\nMost recently, Mr. Remken has served as the Government Relations Specialist at America's Rehab Campuses, Inc. with responsibilities that include collaboration with key facility staff to develop marketing programs, monitor inquiry and admissions performance, and refine plans as appropriate. These responsibilities coincide with Mr. Remken’s deep connection and oversight of the Washington DC based Faces and Voices of Recovery for the West Coast.\nOver next several days, our management will be releasing information regarding the progress of TheShare.TV merger/acquisition candidates, two new product launches, our distribution partners, and the much anticipated revenue streams for MC Endeavors, Inc./Room 21 Media.\nFor further information contact:\nJohn Stippick\nCEO\nMC Endeavors, Inc/Room 21 Media\nPhone: (310) 986-6373\nE-mail: johns@room21media.com\nSafe Harbor Statement - In addition to historical information, this press release may contain statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
