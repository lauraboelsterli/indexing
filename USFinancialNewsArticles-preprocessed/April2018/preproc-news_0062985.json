Mr. Higgins will work closely with Elion’s Board and executive leadership team to continue to develop the firm’s strategic growth path and drive enhanced value to investors.\n“We are excited to welcome John to the Elion family, and look forward to leveraging his extensive knowledge and true understanding of the fundamentals of real estate,” said Juan DeAngulo, Managing Principal at Elion Partners. “From my previous experience working with John, it is clear that his expertise and vast network of relationships will prove invaluable to Elion’s future.”\nMr. Higgins’ career began in 1978 at State Farm, where he gained comprehensive experience across several types of transactions, varying from direct equity investments to loans.

Most recently, Mr. Higgins was Head of Real Estate Investments at State Farm, where he led State Farm’s management of real estate assets with a portfolio of both equity as well as commercial mortgage investments.\n“John has seen the growth of Elion since its early years and we have valued our interactions with him through multiple transactions,” said Jack Azout, Senior Managing Principal of Elion Partners. “I believe John’s experience as a successful investor and operator, combined with his expertise in valuation, transactions, and asset management, make him incredibly well-suited to Elion’s hands-on approach to real estate investing.”\nMr. Higgins added, “Elion Partners has an impressive history of reinforcing solid underwriting standards and making sound investment decisions with a focus on the long-term. There are many synergies between the principle values and investment philosophy of the firm and my own fundamental real estate standards, and I look forward to joining the team.”\nElion Partners strategically considers the composition of its Board, taking care to balance industry, institutional, and operational knowledge and experience, as well as core fundamental values that align with the firm’s culture. The Board is comprised of independent professionals who serve as advisors to the firm, providing Elion Partners with unique insight and industry expertise, enhancing the group's ability to serve its clients and capture opportunities.\nAbout Elion Partners\nFounded in 2010, Elion Partners is a real estate private equity firm with an investment philosophy that is deeply rooted in fundamental experience in both the operational and financial facets of the real estate industry.
