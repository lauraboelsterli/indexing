Mr. Clifford will continue in his current role as CFO until May 4, 2018, at which point he will become a senior advisor to the Company and Steven T. Snyder will assume the role of Chief Financial Officer on an interim basis.\nAbout Gaming and Leisure Properties\nGLPI is engaged in the business of acquiring, financing, and owning real estate property to be leased to gaming operators in triple-net lease arrangements, pursuant to which the tenant is responsible for all facility maintenance, insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties and all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties.
