    "text": "CANTON, Ohio, April 26, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- TimkenSteel (NYSE: TMST, timkensteel.com ), a leader in customized alloy steel products and services, today reported first-quarter net sales of $380.8 million, compared with net sales of $309.4 million in the same quarter last year and $341.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The company reported a net loss of $1.9 million or minus $0.04 per share for the first quarter of 2018, compared with a net loss of $5.3 million or minus $0.12 per share in the same quarter last year, and a net loss of $33.9 million or minus $0.76 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nEBITDA (1) for the first quarter was $21.3 million including $3.7 million of non-recurring costs, compared with EBITDA (1) of $17.5 million in the same quarter last year, and adjusted EBITDA (1) of $8.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.\n\"The year is off to a good start. We improved lead times, reduced past-due orders, won new business for differentiated products and realized improvements in our financial performance,\" said Tim Timken, chairman, CEO and president. \"This year is about executing a strategy to gain advantages beyond the market recovery and set us on a path to grow. We're focused on improving the mix of products we sell, driving fair market pricing and gaining advantages from our unique set of assets. Our financial results in the first quarter are beginning to reflect the impact of this work.\"\nFIRST-QUARTER 2018 FINANCIAL SUMMARY\nFirst-quarter net sales increased $71.4 million or 23.1 percent year over year, and $39.4 million or 11.5 percent sequentially.\nShip tons were approximately 300,000, an increase of 7.1 percent over the first quarter of 2017 and an increase of 4.9 percent sequentially, due to strong end-market demand. Prior-year and sequential gains were from increased volume, higher prices, and improved product mix. Surcharge revenue of $90.7 million increased 55.6 percent from the prior-year quarter as a result of a 21 percent increase in the No. 1 Busheling Index and higher volumes. Compared with the fourth-quarter 2017, surcharge revenue increased 16.9 percent.\nEBIT (1) was $2.8 million, compared with an EBIT (1) loss of $1.4 million for the same period a year ago and an adjusted EBIT (1) loss of $10.3 million for fourth-quarter 2017.\nEBIT (1) improved both year over year and sequentially due to raw material spread as a result of the rising No. 1 Busheling Index, and better price/mix. Included in first-quarter EBIT (1) is $3.7 million of non-recurring legal costs and employee benefit claims. Melt utilization was 77 percent for the quarter driven by improved demand across all end markets, compared with 71 percent in first-quarter 2017 and 68 percent in fourth-quarter 2017.\nSECOND-QUARTER 2018 OUTLOOK\nShipments are expected to be between 5 percent and 10 percent higher than first-quarter 2018 from improving end markets. Net income is projected to be between $8 million and $18 million. EBITDA is projected to be between $30 million and $40 million. Raw material spread is expected to be a headwind of about $6 million.\nOther Guidance\n2018 capital spending is projected to be $40 million.\nThe company will host a conference call at 9 a.m. ET on Friday, April 27, to discuss its financial performance with investors and securities analysts. The financial results and conference call materials will be available online at investors.timkensteel.com .\n(1) Please see discussion of non-GAAP financial measures in this news release.\nTimkenSteel Earnings Call Information:\nConference Call\nFriday, April 27, 2018\n9 a.m. ET\nToll-free dial-in: 866-393-4306\nInternational dial-in: 734-385-2616\nConference ID: 5047779\nConference Call Replay\nReplay dial-in available through May 4, 2018\n855-859-2056 or 404-537-3406\nReplay passcode: 5047779\nAbout TimkenSteel Corporation\nTimkenSteel (NYSE:TMST, timkensteel.com ) creates tailored steel products and services for demanding applications, helping customers push the bounds of what's possible within their industries.

This earnings release includes references to the following non-GAAP financial measures: EBIT, EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA. These are important financial measures used in the management of the business, including decisions concerning the allocation of resources and assessment of performance. Management believes that reporting these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors as these measures are representative of the Company's performance and provide improved comparability of results. See the attached schedules for definitions of the non-GAAP financial measures referred to above and corresponding reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, as well as supplemental financial data. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as additions to, and not as alternatives for, TimkenSteel's results prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the non-GAAP measures TimkenSteel uses may differ from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, and other companies may not define the non-GAAP measures TimkenSteel uses in the same way.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis news release includes \"forward-looking\" statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
