    "text": "NEW YORK, April 02, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- PDL Community Bancorp, (the “Company”) (NASDAQ:PDLB), the holding company for Ponce Bank (the “Bank”), reported a net loss of $4.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net income of $1.4 million for the same period in 2016. The Company was formed on September 29, 2017 in conjunction with the reorganization of Ponce De Leon Federal Bank, Ponce Bank’s predecessor, into Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company, a mutual holding company. Accordingly, the Company’s financial results of prior periods are solely those of Ponce Bank. The Company’s results of operations for 2017 include a one-time pre-tax contribution by the Company of 609,279 shares of common stock, valued at $6.1 million, and $200,000 in cash, to establish the Ponce De Leon Foundation (the “Foundation”).\nThe Company reported a net loss of $2.9 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to net income of $239,000 for the same period in 2016. Earnings (loss) per share, for the period of September 29, 2017 to December 31, 2017, was ($0.16). The Company’s results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 includes a one-time tax expense of $2.1 million due to the enactment of federal tax reform.\n“The quarter ended December 31, 2017 was our first full quarter as a public company; it has been a rewarding and challenging period as we embark on deploying and growing into our capital,” said Steven A. Tsavaris, Executive Chairman. Carlos P. Naudon, President and CEO, noted that “we are delighted with our operating results, particularly with our organic loan growth, and its effects, in the face of headwinds from increasing interest rates.”\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income was $32.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, up $4.4 million, or 15.8% from $27.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 reflects a $5.2 million, or 15.6%, increase in total interest and dividend income offset by an increase of $847,000, or 14.3% in total interest expense. The increase in interest and dividend income is primarily due to the mortgage loan growth that provided an increase in average outstanding loans of $129.7 million or 21.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The net interest rate spread and net interest margin was 3.76% and 4.02%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 3.82% and 4.02%, respectively, for the same period in 2016. The yield on loans decreased to 5.19% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 5.39% for the same period in 2016. The increase in interest expense is due to an increase in average interest-bearing liabilities of $56.7 million, or 10.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased to 1.11% for the year ended December 31, 2017 from 1.06% for the same period in 2016.\nNet interest income was $8.5 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, up $1.5 million, or 21.4%, from $7.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The increase in net interest income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 reflects a $1.8 million, or 21.2%, increase in total interest and dividend income offset by an increase of $378,000, or 24.8%, in total interest expense. The increase in interest and dividend income is primarily due to growth in the investor-owned one-to-four family, multifamily, nonresidential, and construction and land loans, that provided an increase in average outstanding loans of $174.0 million or 27.4%, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The net interest rate spread and net interest margin was 3.58% and 3.88%, respectively, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to 3.74% and 3.95%, respectively, for the same period in 2016. The yield on loans decreased to 4.96% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from 5.23% for the same period in 2016. The increase in interest expense is due to an increase in average interest-bearing liabilities of $70.7 million or 12.5%, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased to 1.15% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from 1.07% for the same period in 2016.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income was $688,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, up $106,000, or 18.2%, from $582,000 for the same period in 2016. The increase is mainly attributed to an increase of $161,000 in late fees and prepayment charges related to mortgage loans.\nNoninterest income was $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, up $673,000, or 27.7%, from $2.4 million for the same period in 2016. The increase is mainly attributed to an increase of $508,000 in late fees and prepayment charges related to mortgage loans.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expenses were $36.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, up $8.7 million, or 31.2%, from $27.9 million for the same period in 2016. The increase is mainly attributed to a one-time pre-tax contribution by the Company of 609,279 shares of common stock, valued at of $6.1 million, and $200,000 in cash, in connection with the establishment of the Foundation, combined with an increase of $2.1 million in total compensation and benefits expense which included an increase of $921,000 related to salaries and an expense of $735,000 related to the newly created Employee Stock Ownership Plan.\nNoninterest expenses were $8.7 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, up $1.6 million, or 22.5%, from $7.1 million for the same period in 2016. The increase is mainly attributed to an increase of $1.1 million in total compensation and benefits expense which included an expense of $735,000 related to the newly created Employee Stock Ownership Plan as part of the reorganization.\nAsset Quality\nNonperforming assets increased to $11.4 million or 1.23% of total assets at December 31, 2017 from $7.7 million or 1.04% of total assets at December 31, 2016. The increase is mainly attributed to an increase in nonaccruals of $3.2 million in owner-occupied one-to-four family residences.\nProvision for loan losses was $1.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to $139,000 for the same period in 2016. Provision for loan losses was $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a recovery of $57,000 for the same period in 2016.

Net charge-offs totaled $1.3 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, or 0.16% of average loans outstanding, compared to a recovery of $102,000 for the same period in 2016. Net charge-offs totaled $850,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 0.12% of average loans outstanding, compared to a recovery of $778,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nBalance Sheet\nTotal assets increased $180.5 million, or 24.2%, to $925.5 million at December 31, 2017 from $745.0 million at December 31, 2016.
