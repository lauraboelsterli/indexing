    "text": "April 20, 2018 / 9:48 AM / Updated 17 minutes ago Sri Lankan rupee ends down on mild importer dollar demand Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nCOLOMBO, April 20 (Reuters) - The Sri Lankan rupee closed weaker in a holiday-shortened trading session on Friday, weighed down by mild importer demand for the greenback, dealers said. \nThe market was closed at 0630 GMT on Friday due to a half-a-day bank holiday. \nThe rupee, which was traded at 156.25/35 per dollar in early trade ended at 156.40/50, weaker from Thursday’s close of 156.20/35. \nThe rupee hit an all-time low of 156.50 on Wednesday. \n“Trade was very thin in a shortened trading session. There were no sellers,” a currency dealer said. \nEarlier this month, the country’s central bank governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said if the inflation rate could be maintained between 4 percent and 5 percent, the depreciation in the rupee would be around 2 percent or 3 percent. \nDealers said they expected no impact from the $2.5 billion inflow anticipated this week in two tranches of sovereign bonds, the country’s largest offering in history. \nThe central bank has bought around $400 million from the market in the first three months of this year to help build reserves and repay some debt. \nThe rupee has weakened 1.9 percent so far this year. It dropped 2.5 percent last year and 3.9 percent in 2016. \nDealers said they expect the rupee to gradually weaken and face higher volatility this year due to debt repayments by the government. \nForeign investors sold government securities worth a net 2.4 billion rupees ($15.36 million) so far this year through April 11, the central bank data showed. $1 = 156.3000 Sri Lankan rupees Reporting by Shihar Aneez and Ranga Sirilal, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips",
