    "text": "16 COMMENTS BEIJING—Chinese President Xi Jinping outlined an updated vision for China’s future as an internet and technology power, pledging more state support for sectors caught in the crosshairs of a trade fight with the U.S.\nSpeaking at a two-day conclave on cyberspace that ended Saturday, Mr. Xi called on officials, enterprises and researchers to redouble already extensive national efforts to achieve breakthroughs in “core technologies” like semiconductors—an area where China still lags behind the U.S.\nThe development of new information technologies “presents the Chinese people with an opportunity you rarely see in a thousand years,” Mr. Xi said, according to an account of his speech published by the official Xinhua News Agency. “We must keenly seize the historic opportunity.”\nMr. Xi’s speech echoes themes made in a landmark address in 2016 in which he set out a blueprint for China to become an “internet superpower.” His remarks this year come as technology has emerged at the center of escalating trade disputes between China and the U.S. that has also ensnared trade in Chinese steel and aluminum and U.S. sorghum.\nEarlier this week, the U.S. banned American businesses from supplying technology and services to Chinese telecom equipment giant ZTE Corp. for violating a year-old agreement after the company admitted to disregarding sanctions and selling gear to Iran and other countries.\nThe move has the potential to cripple a company regarded as a national champion and was seen by many in China as a direct assault on the country’s efforts to dominate next-generation mobile internet technologies, known as 5G.\nIn the days since, China’s Commerce Ministry has expressed reservations about American company Qualcomm Inc.’s acquisition of Dutch company NXP Semiconductors , casting doubts that the deal will win a necessary approval.\nMr. Xi’s 2016 call for China to dominate cyberspace has become a rallying point for nationalistic commentators and security experts calling on China to close the technology gap and end the country’s continued reliance on U.S. companies for advanced chipsets and other key technologies.\nIn this week’s speech, Mr. Xi added a call to create a fair market environment, improve protections of intellectual property and guard against monopolies, taking aim at factors Chinese companies have said are barriers to innovation and to attracting foreign investment.\nMr. Xi also pushed hard for Chinese companies to collaborate with the military in pursuing new technologies. So called civil-military fusion has taken on increasing importance in the party’s plans for developing artificial intelligence, quantum communications and other advanced fields.\nThe internet and information technology is “the liveliest and most promising area for civil-military fusion,” Xinhua quoted Mr. Xi as saying.\nWrite to Josh Chin at josh.chin@wsj.com",
