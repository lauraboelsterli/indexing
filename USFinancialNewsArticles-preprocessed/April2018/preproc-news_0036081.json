    "text": "TOKYO, Japanâ€™s Nikkei share average raced to a seven-week high on Wednesday as risk sentiment recovered after Wall Street rose overnight on earnings hopes, while a weaker yen lifted shares across the board.\nAlso helping the mood was an easing political tensions on the Korean peninsula after a senior U.S. official said CIA Director Mike Pompeo made a secret visit to North Korea over the Easter weekend and met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\nThe Nikkei ended 1.4 percent higher to 22,158.20, its strongest closing level since Feb. 27.\nThe dollar rose 0.3 percent to 107.295 yen after dipping to 106.885 on Tuesday.\nIndex-heavy stocks such as Fast Retailing Co and Fanuc rallied 2.1 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively, while exporters advanced as well. Advantest rose 3.8 percent, TDK Corp added 2.5 percent and Panasonic Corp advanced 1.5 percent.\nThe broader Topix gained 1.1 percent to 1,749.67.\nReporting by Ayai Tomisawa; Editing by Sam Holmes\n ",
