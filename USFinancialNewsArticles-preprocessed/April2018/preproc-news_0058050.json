    "text": "DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- UDR, Inc. (the “Company”) First Quarter 2018 Highlights:\nNet income per share was $0.30, Funds from Operations (“FFO”) per share was $0.47, FFO as Adjusted (“FFOA”) per share was $0.47, and Adjusted Funds from Operations (“AFFO”) per share was $0.45. Net income attributable to common stockholders was $80.8 million as compared to $25.0 million in the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to higher gains on the sale of real estate. Year-over-year same-store (“SS”) revenue, expense and net operating income (“NOI”) growth was 3.0 percent, 3.6 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively. Invested $20.0 million into Alameda Point, a 220-home Developer Capital Program (“DCP”) project located in Alameda, CA through a secured note. At quarter end, the Company’s DCP investment totaled $159.3 million. Repurchased approximately 593 thousand common shares at an average price of $33.69 for approximately $20.0 million. Elected Thomas W. Toomey as Chairman of the Company’s Board, in addition to his responsibilities as Chief Executive Officer and President, effective January 1, 2018. Contemporaneously, James D. Klingbeil was elected Lead Independent Director of the Board.

This increase was primarily attributable to growth in revenue from same-store communities, stabilized, non-mature and development communities.\nIn the first quarter, same-store NOI increased 2.7 percent year-over-year and was driven by same-store revenue growth of 3.0 percent and a 3.6 percent increase in same-store expenses. Weighted average same-store physical occupancy increased by 30 basis points year-over-year at 96.9 percent. The first quarter annualized rate of turnover was 40.0 percent, representing a 120 basis point decline year-over-year.\nSummary of Same-Store Results First Quarter 2018 versus First Quarter 2017\nRegion Revenue\nGrowth\nExpense\nGrowth/\n(Decline)\nNOI\nGrowth/\n(Decline)\n% of\nSame-Store\nPortfolio (1)\nSame - Store\nOccupancy (2)\nNumber of\nSame-Store\nHomes (3)\nWest 4.1 % 1.8 % 4.8 % 44.0 % 96.4 % 13,698 Mid-Atlantic 2.3 % 6.4 % 0.5 % 23.7 % 97.4 % 10,480 Northeast 0.4 % 4.2 % (1.2 )% 15.9 % 97.4 % 3,493 Southeast 4.8 % (0.1 )% 7.1 % 12.6 % 96.8 % 7,683 Southwest 0.9 % 8.2 % (3.4 )% 3.8 % 96.3 % 2,923 Total 3.0 % 3.6 % 2.7 % 100.0 % 96.9 % 38,277 (1) Based on Q1 2018 NOI.\n(2) Weighted average same-store occupancy for the quarter.\n(3) During the first quarter, 38,277 apartment homes were classified as same-store.

Of this total, 91 percent had been funded. All of the Company’s development communities were in lease-up as of the end of the first quarter. The development pipeline is currently expected to produce a weighted average spread between stabilized yields and current market cap rates of 150 to 200 basis points.\nDCP\nAt the end of the first quarter, the Company’s DCP investment, including accrued return, totaled $159.3 million.

The Company ended the quarter with fixed-rate debt representing 86.7 percent of its total debt, a total blended interest rate of 3.7 percent and a weighted average maturity of 5.1 years.

FFO as Adjusted is not intended to represent cash flow or liquidity for the period, and is only intended to provide an additional measure of our operating performance. The Company believes that net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to FFO as Adjusted. However, other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating FFO as Adjusted or similar FFO measures and, accordingly, our FFO as Adjusted may not always be comparable to FFO as Adjusted or similar FFO measures calculated by other REITs. FFO as Adjusted should not be considered as an alternative to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP) as an indication of financial performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as a measure of our liquidity. A reconciliation from net income attributable to common stockholders to FFO as Adjusted is provided on Attachment 2.\nFunds from Operations (\"FFO\") attributable to common stockholders and unitholders: The Company defines FFO attributable to common stockholders and unitholders as net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate or of investments in non-consolidated investees that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the investee, gains or losses from sales of depreciable property, plus real estate depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for noncontrolling interests, unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. This definition conforms with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust's definition issued in April 2002. In the computation of diluted FFO, if OP Units, DownREIT Units, unvested restricted stock, unvested LTIP units, stock options, and the shares of Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock are dilutive, they are included in the diluted share count.\nManagement considers FFO a useful metric for investors as the Company uses FFO in evaluating property acquisitions and its operating performance and believes that FFO should be considered along with, but not as an alternative to, net income and cash flow as a measure of the Company's activities in accordance with GAAP. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs. A reconciliation from net income/(loss) attributable to common stockholders to FFO is provided on Attachment 2.\nHeld For Disposition Communities: The Company defines Held for Disposition Communities as those communities that were held for sale as of the end of the most recent quarter.\nJoint Venture Reconciliation at UDR's weighted average ownership interest: In thousands 1Q 2018\nIncome/(loss) from unconsolidated entities $ (1,677 ) Management fee 1,205 Interest expense 9,558 Depreciation 14,340 General and administrative 125 West Coast Development JV Preferred Return - Attachment 12(B) (1,022 ) Developer Capital Program - Other (excludes Alameda Point Block 11) (1,428 ) Other (income)/expense 167 Total Joint Venture NOI at UDR's Ownership Interest $ 21,268 Net Operating Income (“NOI”): The Company defines NOI as rental income less direct property rental expenses. Rental income represents gross market rent and other revenues less adjustments for concessions, vacancy loss and bad debt. Rental expenses include real estate taxes, insurance, personnel, utilities, repairs and maintenance, administrative and marketing. Excluded from NOI is property management expense which is calculated as 2.75% of property revenue to cover the regional supervision and accounting costs related to consolidated property operations, and land rent.\nManagement considers NOI a useful metric for investors as it is a more meaningful representation of a community’s continuing operating performance than net income as it is prior to corporate-level expense allocations, general and administrative costs, capital structure and depreciation and amortization and is a widely used input, along with capitalization rates, in the determination of real estate valuations.

As such, the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle is backed out for FFO.\n(3)\nSeries E preferred shares are dilutive for purposes of calculating FFO per share.
