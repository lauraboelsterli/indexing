    "text": "MOSCOW, April 11 (Reuters) - The Russian military said on Wednesday it was closely watching the situation around Syria and was aware of the movements of a U.S. naval force in the Gulf.\nIn an apparent response to U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s comments about a possible U.S. missile attack on Syria, the Russian Defence Ministry also said in a statement that Washington would do better to rebuild the destroyed Syrian city of Raqqa rather than talk about its readiness carry out such strikes.
