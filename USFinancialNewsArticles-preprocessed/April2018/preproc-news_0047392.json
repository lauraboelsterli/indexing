GLOBAL MARKETS • Wall Street's three major indexes declined on Friday as investors worried about a jump in U.S. bond yields, with technology stocks leading the decline on nerves about upcoming earnings reports and iPhone demand. • Asian stocks dipped as investors braced for a bevy of earnings from the world's largest corporations, while keeping a wary eye on U.S. bond yields as they approach peaks that have triggered market spasms in the past. • The dollar traded near a two-week high against a basket of major currencies on Monday, bolstered by rising U.S. bond yields, while easing concerns over global political risks weighed on the safe haven yen. • The 10-year Treasury yield reached its highest level since March 21 as the bond selloff continued for a second day on Friday, driving the yield curve steeper after two weeks of flattening. • Oil prices dipped on Monday as a rising U.S. rig count pointed to further increases in the country's output, underlining one of only a few factors holding back crude markets in an otherwise bullish environment. • Gold prices slipped to their lowest level in nearly two weeks on Monday as the dollar remained supported on the back of rising U.S. Treasury yields.
