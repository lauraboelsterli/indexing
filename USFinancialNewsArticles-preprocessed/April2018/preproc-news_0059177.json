    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - California voters will get to decide in a statewide November ballot whether their state should borrow $8.9 billion for water projects, Secretary of State Alex Padilla said on Wednesday.\nIf approved, the state would issue bonds to pay for $3 billion of drinking water projects, $2.9 billion of watershed and fisheries improvements and $940 million of habitat protection, with the rest going for groundwater storage, dam repairs and other water infrastructure.\nInterests payments of $8.4 billion over 40 years would add to the total costs, with annual principal and interest costs averaging about $433 million, Padillaâ€™s office said in a statement.\nThe initiative needed enough petition signatures - 365,880, or equal to 5 percent of votes cast in the last gubernatorial election - to be eligible for the ballot.\nThe measure would come in addition to a $4 billion bond measure for parks and water projects already planned for a June ballot, according to local news reports.\nReporting by Hilary Russ; Editing by Tom Brown\n ",
