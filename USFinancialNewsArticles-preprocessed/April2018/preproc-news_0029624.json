    "text": "LONDON, April 13 (Reuters) - Influential advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has recommended shareholders vote against the remuneration policy that Unilever will put forth at its annual meetings next month.\nIn a report issued late on Friday, the group said there were notable improvements, but concerns about the impact of the consumer goods company moving from a base salary to a consolidated “fixed pay” structure, particularly as a result of increases to fixed pay and the annual bonus potential.\n“On balance, shareholder support is not considered warranted for the remuneration policy,” it said.
