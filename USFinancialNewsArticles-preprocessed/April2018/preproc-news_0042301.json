    "text": "From the Creator of USA Network’s “White Collar,” Cinedigm Will Release the Film to Theaters and Leading Digital and TV VOD Platforms on May 4, Followed by a Home Entertainment Release in June\nJon Huertas (“This is Us”), Jade Tailor (“The Magicians”), Nichola Fynn (“Transparent”) and Jennifer Blanc-Biehn ( She Rises ) Star\nMIAMI, Synkronized Films has acquired all U.S. distribution rights to the psychological thriller ALTERED PERCEPTION, directed by Kate Rees Davies in her feature-length debut. Cinedigm (NASDAQ:CIDM) will release the picture theatrically and on Digital and TV VOD on May 4, 2018, with a DVD release to follow in June 2018.\nWhen the government attempts to produce a designer drug aimed at correcting the false perceptions that people develop during trauma and stress, the implications are deadly. Advertised as a cure for socio-political tensions, four couples volunteer, but end up with far more than they bargained for as their past and present are examined while taking variations of the new drug. However, this causes them to doubt their own memory, perceptions – and even their own sanity in this thriller in the vein of Disturbing Behavior and The Faculty .\nFeaturing a story by Jon Huertas and Jennifer Blanc-Biehn, the ensemble cast features Huertas (“This is Us,” “Generation Kill,” “Castle”), Jade Tailor (“The Magicians,” “Aquarius,” “Murder in the First”), Nichola Fynn (“Hot in Cleveland,” Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides ), Matthew Ziff ( Kickboxer: Vengeance, Trafficked ) and Jennifer Blanc-Biehn ( The Night Visitor 2, Havenhurst , “Dark Angel”).\n“In a world where truth is questioned every day, ALTERED PERCEPTION raises the stakes in unforeseen ways,” says CEO Alex Cohen. “Taut and thrilling, with smart writing, a director with a fresh voice and a truly terrific ensemble cast, we’re certain it’s a film that will resonate with moviegoers everywhere.”\nAbout Synkronized Films\nCreated in 2000, Synkronized Films has distributed the work of some of the world’s major directors and box office worthy movies.
