    "text": "HAILEY, ID, April 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- POWER Engineers Incorporated (POWER) is expanding its reach into Canada with its acquisition of Alberta-based MITKOR Consulting, Ltd.\nMITKOR is a 30-person firm with offices in Edmonton, Alberta and Airdrie, a suburb of Calgary, Alberta. The firm’s main focus has been on distribution engineering services and supplementary transmission design for Canadian municipalities and utilities.\n“Welcoming MITKOR to POWER is a crucial part of our efforts to better serve our Canadian clients,” said Bret Moffett, POWER’s CEO. “Our cultures are very similar, and we look forward to being able to offer our full suite of engineering services to existing and potential clients in Alberta and beyond.”\nThe firm’s current clients will be able to work with the same teams they know and trust while enjoying the additional service offerings and resources provided by POWER’s 2,500-person staff with experts in eight divisions.\nMITKOR was founded in 2008 and has since built a reputation for expert engineering, integrity and client focus.\n“Since our creation, we’ve had a commitment to providing the best possible service to our clients,” said MITKOR partner and founder Tim Ito. “Becoming part of the POWER organization will allow us to provide even better service while providing our experts more opportunities for growth.”\nPOWER will retain both MITKOR offices. Tim Ito and co-founder Mark Ito will remain in their positions over the Airdrie and Edmonton offices, while co-owner Cole Dingman will remain in his client management role.\nThe acquisition is part of a larger effort by POWER to expand its service offerings to Canadian clients, utilities and developers. POWER’s major projects in Canada have included the Kemano-Kitikat catenary installation, which was the world’s second high-voltage transmission line catenary, located in the remote mountains of British Columbia.\nAbout POWER Engineers: POWER Engineers is a global consulting engineering firm specializing in the delivery of integrated solutions for energy, food and beverage facilities, communications, environmental, and federal markets.
