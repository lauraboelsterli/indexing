    "text": "April 5 (Reuters) - Britain’s Hammerson Plc on Thursday said it did not intend to finalise shareholder documents related to its proposed acquisition of Intu Properties , as it awaits clarity on a bid from France’s Klepierre .\nThe U.K. shopping centres owner rejected a 4.9-billion-pound ($6.89 billion) bid from the French company in March, months after it set out to buy smaller rival Intu.\nHammerson said the so-called put up or shut up (PUSU) deadline for Klépierre is April 16.\nThe company, which owns Bristol’s Cabot Circus, also said in a trading statement that the first three months of 2018 had a strong start with leases signed totalling 7 million pounds, up 59 percent from a year earlier.
