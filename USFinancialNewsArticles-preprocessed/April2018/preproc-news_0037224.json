The initial investment yield is below the low end of the Company’s 2018 guidance, however, the actual yield could meet or exceed the upper end of the Company’s guidance in the first 2 to 3 years of the lease.

(2)\nThe amount for the Mitigation Bank represents the amount for the buyer’s acquisition of approximately 70% of the joint venture that owns the Mitigation Bank, with the Company retaining 30%. (3)\nPursuant to the contract, amount includes the reimbursement of infrastructure costs incurred by the Company for Tomoka Town Center plus interest accrued as of March 31, 2018. (4)\nThe acres and amount include the buyer’s option to acquire 19 acres for approximately $2.0 million, in addition to the base contract of 26 acres for approximately $3.2 million. (5)\nThe acres and amount include the buyer’s option to acquire 71 acres for approximately $574,000, in addition to the base contract of 129 acres for approximately $2.75 million. As noted above, these agreements contemplate closing dates ranging from the second quarter of 2018 through fiscal year 2020, and although some of the transactions may close in 2018, the buyers may not be contractually obligated to close until after 2018. Each of the transactions are in varying stages of due diligence by the various buyers including, in some instances, making submissions to the planning and development departments of the City of Daytona Beach, and other permitting activities with other applicable governmental authorities including wetlands-related permits from the St. John’s River Water Management District and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and conducting traffic analyses with the Florida Department of Transportation and negotiating other matters with Volusia County. In addition to other customary closing conditions, the majority of these transactions are conditioned upon the receipt of approvals or permits from those various governmental authorities, as well as other matters that are beyond our control. If such approvals are not obtained or costs to meet governmental requirements or obligations are too high, the prospective buyers may have the ability to terminate their respective agreements prior to closing. As a result, there can be no assurances regarding the likelihood or timing of any one of these potential land transactions being completed or the final terms thereof, including the sales price.\nExcluding the approximately 6,000 acres under contract, the Company’s remaining land holdings consist of approximately 2,100 acres of undeveloped land.\nUpdate Regarding Development in our Area\nThe following provides an update regarding the developments ongoing and recently completed on land we have sold over the past few years:\nIn March 2018, the nearly 400-unit first phase of the 3,400-home age-restricted master-planned community, Latitude Margaritaville, being built by Minto Communities had its first homebuyers move in. To date Minto has sold approximately 75% of the first phase inventory; The 400,000 square-foot distribution facility for BBraun, built by VanTrust, commenced operations in the first quarter of 2018; The vertical development of the approximately 400,000 square-foot retail power center at Tomoka Town Center by North American Development Group (“NADG”) was completed with shell construction now underway; NADG’s joint project with Eastwind Development to develop the 276-unit Tomoka Pointe luxury rental community broke ground during the quarter; Mosaic, the 1,000-home residential development by ICI Homes is well under way and the first homes are in construction; and The vertical construction of the new Honda dealership has begun at the southern end of the auto mall, on the west side of Interstate 95.\nFinancial Results\nRevenue\nTotal revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 decreased to approximately $24.9 million, compared to approximately $38.7 million during the same period in 2017. This decrease was primarily the result of the decrease in revenues from our real estate operations, offset by an increase in our revenue from our income property operations, both of which are outlined in the following tables, respectively:\nIncrease (Decrease) Income Property Operations Segment Revenue for the\nQuarter\n($000’s)\nvs Same Period\nin 2017\n($000’s)\nRevenue from Recent Acquisitions $ 1,702 $ 1,599 Revenue from The Grove and the Beach Restaurants 401 397 Revenue from Remaining Portfolio 6,523 88 Accretion of Above Market/Below Market Intangibles 580 49 Total Related to Income Property Operations $ 9,206 $ 2,133 Increase (Decrease) Real Estate Operations Segment Revenue for the\nQuarter\n($000’s)\nvs Same Period\nin 2017\n($000’s)\nLand Sales Revenue $ 13,117 $ (15,590 ) Revenue from Reimbursement of Infrastructure Costs — (320 ) Subsurface Revenue 746 515 Impact Fees/Mitigation Credit Sales 116 (100 ) Total Related to Real Estate Operations $ 13,979 $ (15,495 ) Total revenue for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 was also impacted by a decrease of approximately $236,000 in the revenue generated by our commercial loan investments, primarily as a result of the sale of our two mezzanine loans in October 2017.\nNet Income\nNet income and basic net income per share for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in 2017, was as follows:\nIncrease (Decrease) For the\nQuarter\nvs Same Period in\n2017\nvs Same\nPeriod in 2017\n(%)\nNet Income ($000’s) $ 10,912 $ (1,834 ) -14 % Basic Net Income Per Share $ 1.97 $ (0.31 ) -14 % The above results for the first quarter of 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017, reflected the following significant operating elements in addition to the impacts on revenues described above:\nA decrease in direct cost of revenues of approximately $7.3 million reflecting the decrease in the direct cost of revenues for the real estate operations of approximately $7.6 million, which primarily reflects the lower level of land transactions during the first quarter of 2018, and an increase of approximately $0.5 million in the operating costs of the income property operations segment reflecting the larger income property portfolio; The gain recognized on the sale of four multi-tenant flex-office properties of approximately $3.7 million; Increased interest expense of approximately $500,000 resulting from increased borrowings on our credit facility; and An increase in depreciation and amortization of approximately $1.1 million resulting from the growth in our income property portfolio.\nIn addition, net income was impacted by decreased general and administrative expenses of approximately $400,000 which is summarized as follows:\nIncrease (Decrease) For the\nQuarter\n($000’s)\nvs Same Period in\n2017\n($000’s)\nvs Same\nPeriod in 2017\n(%)\nRecurring General & Administrative Expenses $ 1,833 $ (107 ) -6 % Non-Cash Stock Compensation 468 114 32 % Costs of Shareholder Matter & Proxy Contest 523 (403 ) -44 % Total General & Administrative Expenses $ 2,824 $ (396 ) -12 % 1 st Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call & Webcast\nThe Company to present its operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 tomorrow, Wednesday, April 18, 2018, at 9:00 a.m. eastern time.
