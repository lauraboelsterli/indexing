Change of Business\nIn light of the successful monetization of our previous investments and the current market conditions of the mining industry, the management believed that a diversified investment portfolio approach can generate more opportunities and flexibility for the Company and will create additional shareholder value in the long term. GobiMin completed its change of business from a “mining issuer” to an “investment issuer” in September 2017.\n(a) Equity Investments\nEquity investments represent equity interests of other publicly-trading or privately-held companies that the Group acquired.\nThe equity investments portfolio is summarized as follows:\n(i) Gold Project in Xinjiang\nThe Company owns a 70% equity interest in Xinjiang Tongyuan Minerals Limited which is developing the Gold Project in Xinjiang. During this year, apart from continuing to focus on applications for conversion and renewal of the exploration and mining licences, GobiMin has been seeking for potential partners to co-develop such project. As at December 31, 2017, two of the three required Chinese standard geological reports for the conversion application were approved. The third report concerning the development plan is under preparation. As at April 25, 2018, the Department of Land Resources of Xinjiang has accepted our renewal application on existing exploration and mining licence. The renewed exploration and mining licence are expected to be received in 2018.\nAs at December 31, 2017, there was addition of research and development cost of $53,896 to the exploration and evaluation assets and the Group has a contractual commitment of $1.6 million for the development of the Gold Project.\n(ii) Base Metal Exploration Projects in Xinjiang\nThe Group owns a 40% equity interest in each of the three companies incorporated in Xinjiang, China, which are engaged in exploration of nickel, copper, and gold. As at December 31, 2017, the carrying value of these companies, which are regarded as associates of the Group, amounted to $0.2 million (RMB1.3 million) in aggregate. The dissolution procedures of these three exploration companies have been commenced since November 2017.\n(iii) Others\nThe Group holds 40,260,000 shares of Loco Hong Kong Holdings Limited (“Loco HK”), representing 8.38% of the total outstanding shares of Loco HK. Loco HK is a company incorporated in Hong Kong and the shares of which are listed on the GEM of The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited under the stock code 8162. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the fair value loss on investment in Loco HK were $1.3 million.\nThe Group invested about $4.12 million in Dragon Silver Holdings Limited (“Dragon Silver”), a Hong Kong based metal trading and processing company, by way of (1) an equity investment of $1.1 million in 670,000 shares, representing 9.90% of its total issued capital and (2) a loan of $3 million, bearing interest at 8.5% per annum and repayable on demand at a notice of 7 days. Dragon Silver is mainly engaged in trading, production, processing and investment in precious metals and non-ferrous metals and related products.\nSubsequent to December 31, 2017, the Group invested a total of RMB10 million (equivalent to approximately $1.5 million), through its China indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, in an agriculture project for development, planting and sales of primary agricultural products and plants cultivation in Hami City, Xinjiang, China. The project would occupy an area of about 250 mu (equivalent to about 166,000 sq. meters) to plant Hami red dates or any cash crops. The invested funding would be mainly used for land acquisition, infrastructure facilities, crops and staff costs as well as general working capital.\n(b) Debentures\nThe Group would hold debentures bearing low risks and reasonable interest return from various industries through the open market. Debentures are held to receive coupon interest payments as well as to realize potential gains. The Group may dispose of debentures through the open market when the Group requires funds for operational or investment needs.\nAs at December 31, 2017, the Group held $6.8 million debentures with coupon rates ranged from 4.250% to 9.000% per annum and maturities ranged between November 14, 2018 and perpetual.\n(c) Certificate of Deposit\nThe Group would hold certificate of deposit placed with licensed banks bearing coupon rates of 1% per annum or above and having maturities within one year. As at December 31, 2017, the Group held $0.5 million certificate of deposit with coupon rate of 1.030% per annum and maturity in February 2018.\n2. Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAs at December 31, 2017, the Group had a working capital of about $21.7 million (2016: $30.9 million), by netting off its current assets of $25.4 million (2016: $34.7 million) with current liabilities of $3.7 million (2016: $3.8 million).\nThe Group has no difficulties in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities and commitment.
