    "text": "0 COMMENTS Antonio Fernández, chief compliance officer at PSEG. Photo: PSEG\nPublic Service Enterprise Group Inc., or PSEG, owns one of the 10 largest electric and gas companies in the U.S., Public Service Electric & Gas. It hired its first chief compliance officer two years ago as Chief Executive Officer Dr. Ralph Izzo sought to emphasize the importance of the area.\nAntonio Fernández came on board at the N.J.-based firm in April 2016. He served previously as compliance chief for General Electric Co.’s nuclear business and as leader of the conglomerate’s corporate ombudsman program. Mr. Fernández spoke with Risk & Compliance Journal about encouraging whistleblowers to speak up and how the rise of social media has affected compliance. Edited excerpts of the interview follow.\nAre there challenges specific to the power and gas industry to promoting a culture where people are comfortable speaking up?\nMr. Fernández: I don’t know that they’re specific to the industry. I think that when you think about speaking up you need to think more about human nature and how people approach difficult conversations. I think that if you talk to somebody in a multinational you will see variations in comfort speaking up more by region or country than by industry.\nWhat role do corporate ombudsman programs play in encouraging whistleblowers?\nMr. Fernández: I was corporate ombuds leader at GE. What you find in a lot of large organizations, particularly in multinationals, is that the functional people might not be co-located with the distributed facilities. So if you have a large manufacturing facility in Malaysia, for example, maybe you don’t have a compliance person there locally and the only resources available are management and maybe a human-resources professional.\nOftentimes humans resources unfairly gets branded as just an offshoot of management so it’s not seen as independent. What the ombuds program provides is an independent local channel, generally someone that has a good reputation with the workforce, that will receive information and will not immediately be aligned to the management view of a question.\nDoes PSEG have an ombudsman program?\nMr. Fernández: We don’t. I’m the first chief compliance officer [at PSEG]. Slowly but surely we’ve been building a more mature program; it is on my list of things to consider but we’re not there yet. If I were at a multinational with a very distributed workforce, that was very far from the compliance team, it’d probably be something that was higher on my list. I’m at most four or five hours drive from our furthest location.\nHow can internal investigations best be handled to encourage reporting?\nMr. Fernández: What I think is the challenge is managing perceptions. In our company we have an investigator’s code of conduct. We saw a need to better inform our employees [about] what is it that you are to expect to hold us accountable to–such that not only they understood that they have an obligation to cooperate but also that the investigator also has obligations. I think the lack of transparency in an investigation can create a trust deficit, if you will. And one of the best ways to build trust is to have transparent processes.\nYou have spoken a lot about efforts to encourage reporting. Do line managers ever get in the way?\nMr. Fernández: When concerns come up employees themselves feel that they’re at a disadvantage because it’s not something they do all the time. The same thing goes for managers. We’ve been very intentional in training our managers, supervisors, directors and the part that we emphasize is that most people don’t like to complain about something. So bear that in mind. Think of the experience that person went through overcoming natural barriers to rocking the boat and give them respect. We always say the first thing and the last thing to say in that conversation is, “Thank you for coming to me.”\nDoes the #MeToo movement have implications for compliance professionals?\nMr. Fernández: What #MeToo is an example of is the power of social media. The way that communication spreads is very different. And what that means for a compliance professional is that the stuff that you’re supposed to be doing is now under a bigger lens. And you need to have done your homework. You always have been expected to do so and now maybe the additional expectation is that you’re able to explain that to new stakeholders that you perhaps didn’t even know you had.\nWrite to Henry Cutter at Henry.Cutter@wsj.com.

A more harmonized and integrated enterprise compliance program, one that includes risk management activities and controls for the supply chain, can help improve compliance efforts. In addition, organizations may want to assess core supply chain management issues that are considered sources of compliance challenges, including transparency in product origin, as well as communication across the organization.\nPlease note: The Wall Street Journal News Department was not involved in the creation of the content above.
