With what right?” he added.\nHe reserved particular scorn for the U.S. president, who delivered an ultimatum to the European powers on Jan. 12, saying they must agree to “fix the terrible flaws of the Iran nuclear deal” or he would refuse to extend the U.S. sanctions relief on Iran that it calls for. U.S. sanctions will resume unless Trump issues fresh “waivers” to suspend them on May 12.\n“You don’t have any background in politics. You don’t have any background in law. You don’t have any background on international treaties,” Rouhani said, addressing Trump.\n“How can a tradesman, a merchant, a building constructor, a tower constructor make judgements about international affairs,” he added referring to Trump’s career as a property developer.\n“THE DEAL IS THE DEAL” Despite some resistance in Italy because of a series of billion dollar business deals with Iran, most European governments are behind the new diplomatic effort to persuade Trump, although they caution that they do not know if he will back it.\n“We will continue to discuss the issue with the UK and France, but also with the U.S.,” Germany’s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told Reuters in Brussels, where he was attending a Syria donor conference.\n“The Vienna nuclear agreement is very important and we want to uphold it. We want to help along a situation where the US stays in the agreement beyond May 12,” he said, referring to the Austrian capital where the accord was signed in 2015.\nRouhani said that he had only heard details about the European-U.S. proposals from media reports but that he had discussed the issue with Macron in the past.\n“I have personally spoken with Mr. Macron a few times by telephone and one time extensively in person,” Rouhani said. “I told him frankly that not a single sentence will be added or subtracted from the nuclear deal. The deal is the deal.”\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel will hold talks with Trump in Washington later in the week.\nSenior Iranian officials have said repeatedly that Iran’s ballistic missile program is not up for negotiation.\nAccording to a confidential document seen by Reuters, Britain, France and Germany are concerned that Iranian missiles are being used in wars in Yemen and Syria, where Iran is directly involved in the fighting.
