A General Dynamics sign is shown at the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in San Diego, California, U.S. October 17, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo \nCSRA will now be part of General Dynamics Information Technology and all shares of CSRA common stock will be delisted from the NYSE. \nThe deal is expected to add to General Dynamicsâ€™ earnings per share and free cash flow per share in 2019, the company said. \nThe announcement comes a week after peer CACI International Inc ( CACI.N ) withdrew its offer for CSRA amid the bidding war with General Dynamics.
