    "text": "April 11 (Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc said on Wednesday it is planning to offer more modes of transportation for riders through its app, giving people more ways to get around in cities.\nUber said it is rolling out three new updates. Later this month in San Francisco, the ride hailing firm is launching Uber Rent in collaboration with Getaround, a peer-to-peer car sharing service where privately owned cars are available for rent.\nUber also announced a partnership with Masabi, which offers mobile ticketing services for public transport companies, to let its customers book and use transit tickets in the app.\nIt is also expanding Uber Bike by JUMP to Washington DC, first started in San Francisco earlier this year. https://ubr.to/2qqVw8P (Reporting by Sonam Rai in Bengaluru; Editing by Bernard Orr)",
