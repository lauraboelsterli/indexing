    "text": "BROSSARD, Quebec, April 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Diagnos Inc. (“DIAGNOS” or “the Corporation”) (TSX Venture:ADK) (OTCQB:DGNOF), a leader in early detection of critical health issues through the use of its FL AI RE platform based on Artificial Intelligence ( AI ), is pleased to announce the appointment of Dr. Reid Maclellan to its board of directors.\nDr. Maclellan is currently an Instructor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital and chief operating officer of StHealth Capital Partners. His primary area of investigation is focused on vascular anomalies, a group of disorders that affect arteries, capillaries, lymphatics, or veins. Dr. Maclellan frequently lectures internationally and speaks at conferences for the American College of Surgeons, the Plastic Surgery Research Council, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, and the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies.\nDr. Maclellan currently serves on the board of directors for five organizations, including both for-profit and not-for-profit. He is a member of the Scientific Advisory Board for Nanotronics, a privately-held artificial intelligence pioneer. Dr. Maclellan received his MD diploma from the University of Alabama School of Medicine. He then completed a general surgery internship at the University of Tennessee College of Medicine Chattanooga and a plastic surgery research fellowship and clinical fellowship at Boston Children’s Hospital. Dr. Maclellan also holds a Master in Medical Sciences degree in translational research from Harvard Medical School.\n“We are delighted to have Dr. Maclellan joining the Board. Going forward, I am convinced that DIAGNOS will greatly benefit from his specialized knowledge of vascular biology, especially in the continuous development of our CARA screening applications,” said Mr. Georges Hebert, Chairman of the board of directors of DIAGNOS. “As a surgeon-scientist, I am continuously looking for new initiative ways to help my patients and the public in general. The CARA technology is in-line with my fields of interest and I am looking forward to contributing to the success of DIAGNOS,” said Dr. Maclellan.\nDIAGNOS is also announcing that Mr. Tristram Coffin has resigned from his position as a director. The board wishes to thank Mr. Coffin for his great contribution to the development of DIAGNOS.\nAbout DIAGNOS and its technologies\nDIAGNOS has developed CARA (Computer Assisted Retinal Analysis), a tele-ophthalmology platform that integrates with existing equipment (hardware and software) and processes at the point of care (POC) and comprises; image upload, image enhancement, automated pre-screening, grading by a specialist, and referral to a specialist. Based on our FL AI RE technology, CARA’s Artificial Intelligence image enhancement algorithms make standard retinal images sharper, clearer, and easier to read. CARA is accessible securely over the internet, and is compatible with all recognized image formats and brands of fundus cameras, and is EMR compatible. CARA is a cost-effective tool for screening large numbers of patients, in real time and has been approved by regulatory authorities including Health Canada, US Food and Drug Administration, the European Union and others.\nAdditional information is available at www.diagnos.ca and www.sedar.com .\nFor further information, please contact:\nMr. André Larente, President Daniel Renaud or Thomas Renaud, Managing Directors DIAGNOS Inc.
