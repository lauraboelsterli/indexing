    "text": "VANCOUVER, Wash., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Riverview Bancorp, Inc. (Nasdaq GSM:RVSB) (“Riverview” or the “Company”) today reported net income increased to $3.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in its fourth fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018, compared to $2.0 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, in the fourth fiscal quarter a year ago. In the preceding quarter net income was $1.5 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. The preceding quarter’s net income was impacted due to a valuation adjustment of the Company’s net deferred tax asset along with the use of a lower blended tax rate, which resulted in an additional tax expense of $1.8 million, or $0.08 per diluted share.\nFor fiscal year 2018, Riverview’s net income increased to $10.2 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $7.4 million, or $0.33 per diluted share, in fiscal year 2017.\n“We are pleased with our financial performance for the fiscal year,” said Kevin Lycklama, president and chief executive officer. “Fiscal 2018 was one of our most profitable years, supported by strong balance sheet growth, the expansion of our net interest margin and improving operating efficiencies. Our focus in the coming fiscal year remains on growing the franchise in our local markets and continuing to improve our profitability.”\nFourth Quarter Highlights (at or for the period ended March 31, 2018)\nNet income of $3.0 million, or $0.13 per diluted share. Net interest margin (NIM) expanded by eight basis points to 4.14% compared to the preceding quarter and expanded 17 basis points compared to the fourth quarter a year ago. Total loans increased $14.0 million during the quarter to $811.4 million. Non-performing assets improved to 0.24% of total assets. Tangible book value per share was $3.93. Total risk-based capital ratio was 15.41% and Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.26%. Declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per share, generating a current dividend yield of 1.28% based on the market price on April 25, 2018.\nIncome Statement\nIn the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018, Riverview generated a return on average assets of 1.08% and a return on average equity of 10.39%, compared to 0.79% and 7.43%, respectively in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017.\nNet interest income was $10.7 million in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018, a slight decrease compared to $10.8 million in the preceding quarter and a $1.3 million increase compared to $9.3 million in the fourth fiscal quarter a year ago. The decrease in net interest income compared to the preceding quarter is primarily due to the fewer number of days in the current quarter. In fiscal 2018, net interest income increased $8.9 million to $42.6 million compared to $33.8 million in fiscal 2017.\nRiverview’s fourth fiscal quarter net interest margin expanded eight basis points to 4.14% compared to the preceding quarter and increased 17 basis points when compared to the fourth fiscal quarter a year ago. “We have been successful managing our net interest margin in this interest rate environment,” said Lycklama. “The increase in net interest margin was driven by the continued growth in our loan portfolio, higher rates on new loan originations and a decrease in our excess cash balances.” The interest accretion on purchased loans totaled $199,000 and resulted in an eight basis point increase in the NIM during the fourth fiscal quarter compared to $175,000 and a six basis point increase in the NIM in the preceding quarter. In fiscal year 2018, the NIM increased 29 basis points to 4.08% compared to 3.79% in fiscal 2017.\nThe weighted average note rate on new loans originated during the quarter ended March 31, 2018 increased to 5.17% compared to 4.75% for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 and 4.66% for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nNon-interest income was $2.7 million in the fourth fiscal quarter compared to $2.9 million the prior quarter and a modest increase compared to $2.6 million in the same quarter a year ago. The decrease in the current quarter was partially due to a lower gain on sale of loans compared to the preceding quarter as a result of a decline in mortgage related activity. The December 2017 quarter also included an $81,000 gain on the sale of REO property. For fiscal year 2018, non-interest income increased to $11.0 million compared to $10.0 million for fiscal 2017.\nAsset management fees were $866,000 in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 compared to $911,000 in the preceding quarter and $730,000 in the fourth fiscal quarter a year ago. For fiscal 2018, asset management fees grew 15.4% to $3.4 million compared to $3.0 million a year ago. Riverview Trust Company’s assets under management were $484.3 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $490.1 million three months earlier and $425.9 million a year earlier.\nNon-interest expense increased $569,000 to $9.1 million during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 compared to $8.6 million in the preceding quarter and increased $209,000 from $8.9 million for the same prior year period. “The increase in operating expenses during the quarter was primarily due to an increase in salary related expenses as we built out our lending teams with additional staff to support loan growth,” said Lycklama. The efficiency ratio was 68.5% for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to 62.5% in the preceding quarter and 74.8% in the fourth fiscal quarter a year ago.\nThe effective tax rate for our fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 was 28.2%. As a result of the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company expects the tax rate to decrease to approximately 23.5% beginning April 1, 2018. “While we anticipate a majority of the savings to flow through to our bottom line, we also plan to reinvest a portion of these savings into projects designed to drive continued growth for the Bank including staffing, technology enhancements and infrastructure improvements,” stated Lycklama.\nBalance Sheet Review\nTotal loans increased $14.0 million during the quarter to $811.4 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $797.3 million at December 31, 2017, and increased $31.9 million compared to $779.4 million a year ago, with a large portion of the increases concentrated in commercial business and warehouse/industrial loans. Undisbursed construction loans totaled $74.8 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $62.0 million three months earlier. The increase is primarily due to the origination of $20.1 million in new commercial construction loans during the current quarter. The majority of the undisbursed construction loans are expected to fund over the next several quarters.\n“While loan originations remain strong, total loan balances continue to be impacted by paydowns on existing loans,” said Lycklama. The loan pipeline totaled $74.1 million at the end of the quarter.\nTotal deposits increased $23.5 million to $995.7 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $972.2 million at December 31, 2017, and increased $15.6 million compared to $980.1 million a year ago. Checking account balances increased $37.1 million during the quarter and currently account for 47.4% of total deposits.\nShareholders’ equity was $116.9 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $116.8 million three months earlier and $111.3 million a year earlier. Tangible book value per share (non-GAAP) was $3.93 at both March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 compared to $3.68 at March 31, 2017. A quarterly cash dividend of $0.03 per share was paid on April 24, 2018.\nCredit Quality\nRiverview recorded no provision for loan losses during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 or in the preceding quarter, primarily as a result of the continued low level of delinquent, nonperforming and classified loans, as well as the changes in the volume and mix of loans, which mitigated the required allowance for loan losses due to loan growth.\nNon-performing loans were $2.4 million, or 0.30% of total loans, at March 31, 2018 compared to $2.7 million, or 0.33% of total loans, three months earlier. Real estate owned balances of $298,000 at March 31, 2018 were unchanged compared to the preceding quarter end.\nClassified assets totaled $7.7 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $6.9 million at December 31, 2017 and $10.3 million at March 31, 2017. The classified asset to total capital ratio was 6.2% at March 31, 2018 compared to 5.7% three months earlier and 9.1% a year earlier.\nThe allowance for loan losses totaled $10.8 million, representing 1.33% of total loans at March 31, 2018 compared to $10.9 million and 1.36% of total loans at December 31, 2017. Included in the carrying value of loans are net discounts on the MBank purchased loans which may reduce the need for an allowance for loan losses on these loans, because they are carried at an amount below the outstanding principal balance. The remaining net discount on these purchased loans was $2.2 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $2.4 million at the end of the prior quarter.\nNet loan charge-offs were $101,000 during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 compared to net loan recoveries of $250,000 in the preceding quarter. Net charge-offs increased during the quarter primarily as a result of a decrease in total loan recoveries due to the Company completing the multi-year collection of a large prior charge-off during the preceding quarter.\nCapital\nRiverview continues to maintain capital levels well in excess of the regulatory requirements to be categorized as “well capitalized” with a total risk-based capital ratio of 15.41% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.26% at March 31, 2018. In addition, at that date the Company’s tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio (non-GAAP) was 7.90%.\nManagement Succession\nEffective April 2, 2018, Kevin Lycklama was promoted to president and chief executive officer of the Company and the Bank, following Patrick Sheaffer’s retirement. Mr. Sheaffer continues to serve as chairman of the board of both the Company and the Bank. Additionally, Steven Plambeck was promoted to executive vice president and chief lending officer following the retirement of Dick Michalek.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), this press release contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with information useful in understanding the Company’s financial performance; however, readers of this report are urged to review these non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with GAAP results as reported.\nFinancial measures that exclude intangible assets are non-GAAP measures. To provide investors with a broader understanding of capital adequacy, Riverview provides non-GAAP financial measures for tangible common equity, along with the GAAP measure. Tangible shareholders’ equity is calculated as shareholders’ equity less goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets. We calculate tangible book value per share by dividing tangible shareholders’ equity by the number of common shares outstanding. This non-GAAP financial measure has inherent limitations, is not required to be uniformly applied and is not audited. Further, the non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for book value per share or total shareholders' equity determined in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Reconciliations of the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures are presented below.\n(Dollars in thousands) March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Shareholders' equity $ 116,901 $ 116,803 $ 111,264 Goodwill 27,076 27,076 27,076 Core deposit intangible, net 1,103 1,161 1,335 Tangible shareholders' equity $ 88,722 $ 88,566 $ 82,853 Total assets $ 1,151,535 $ 1,128,342 $ 1,133,939 Goodwill 27,076 27,076 27,076 Core deposit intangible, net 1,103 1,161 1,335 Tangible assets $ 1,123,356 $ 1,100,105 $ 1,105,528 About Riverview\nRiverview Bancorp, Inc.
