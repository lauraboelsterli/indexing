    "text": "April 25, 2018 / 4:18 AM / in 9 minutes Hong Kong stocks follow Wall Street lower; China down Reuters Staff \n* SSEC -0.3 pct, CSI300 -0.3 pct, HSI -0.8 pct \n* HK->Shanghai Connect daily quota used 3.8 pct \n* Shanghai->HK daily quota used 5.2 pct \n* FTSE China A50 -0.6 pct, BNY Mellon ADR China Select Index -0.7 pct \nSHANGHAI, April 25 (Reuters) - Hong Kong stocks slid on Wednesday morning, tracking losses on Wall Street where high bond yields triggered risk aversion. ** By lunch break the Hang Seng index had dropped 0.8 percent to 30,378.89 points while the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index slid 0.8 percent to 12,152.49. ** Sectors fell across the board in Hong Kong, led by IT and material firms. ** On the Wall Street, a rise in U.S. bond yields to 3 percent and warnings from bellwether U.S. companies of higher costs drove fears that corporate earnings growth may peak soon. ** Higher bond yields could also prompt portfolio managers to weigh moving money into more attractive fixed-income securities at the expense of equities. ** The stock market had already been spooked by a climb in bond yields earlier in the year, sliding sharply in February. ** On the mainland, the CSI300 index fell 0.3 percent, to 3,832.39 points at the end of the morning session while the Shanghai Composite Index lost 0.3 percent. ** Around the region, MSCI’s Asia ex-Japan stock index was weaker by 0.69 percent while Japan’s Nikkei index was down 0.39 percent. ** The yuan was quoted at 6.3041 per U.S. dollar, 0.05 percent firmer than the previous close of 6.3073. ** The largest percentage gainers in the main Shanghai Composite index were Star Lake Bioscience Co Inc Zhaoqing Guangdong up 10.11 percent, followed by Sumec Corp Ltd gaining 10.09 percent and Founder Technology Group Co Ltd up by 10.06 percent. ** The largest percentage losers in the Shanghai index were Zhejiang Dayuan Pumps Industry Co Ltd down 10 percent, followed by Sunstone Development Co Ltd, down 7.4 percent and Xiamen Overseas Chinese Electronic Co Ltd , down 5.73 percent. ** The top gainers among H-shares were Great Wall Motor Co Ltd up 6.56 percent, followed by Air China Ltd gaining 4.12 percent and Huaneng Power International Inc , up 2.7 percent. ** The three biggest H-shares percentage losers were Hengan International Group Company Ltd, down 3.11 percent, China Vanke Co Ltd, down 2.7 percent and China Resources Land Ltd, down 2.2 percent. ** As of 04:02 GMT, China’s A-shares were trading at a premium of 22.52 percent over the Hong Kong-listed H-shares.
