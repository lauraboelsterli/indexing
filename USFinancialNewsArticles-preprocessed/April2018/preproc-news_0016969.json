    "text": "LONDON, April 11 (Reuters) - A central bank index of the British pound on a trade-weighted basis rose to its highest since the month of the Brexit referendum vote in June, 2016, data published on Wednesday showed.\nA confluence of factors including growing expectations of a rate hike next month and a favorable transition deal secured by Prime Minister Theresa May last month has prompted investors to load up on the British currency in recent weeks, especially against a listless euro and a struggling dollar.\nThe sterling trade-weighted index rose to 80.43, its highest since June 30, 2016 and is up nearly 3 percent since early March.\nA referendum to leave the European Union took place on June 23, 2016, sending sterling hurtling downwards.
