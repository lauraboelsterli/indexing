    "text": "3 Hours Ago | 01:00 \nA survey of the best airlines in the world compiled by TripAdvisor has placed Singapore Airlines at the top. \nReleased Monday, the survey is just the second to rank airlines that the travel website has carried out. TripAdvisor said to generate the results it put traveler responses over a 12-month period into an algorithm that took into account the quantity and quality of reviews. \nAir New Zealand came second, pushing last year's winner Emirates down into third place. Asian carriers performed well, with three other airlines — Japan, EVA Air and Korean Air — in the top 10. \nThe only U.S. airline to make the list was Southwest , with many reviewers praising its membership program. Many well-known airlines, including British Airways, Virgin Atlantic and American Airlines, didn't feature in the top 10. \nSingapore Airlines came out on top in the economy and first class travel sectors, Qatar Airways took out the title for best business class, while Air New Zealand had the number one premium economy offering. \nIn a separate survey of U.S. airlines released Monday, the annual Air Quality review ranked Alaska Airlines at the top.
