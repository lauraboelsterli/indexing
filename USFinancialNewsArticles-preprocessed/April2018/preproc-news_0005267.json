    "text": "DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla., April 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- JKG Group today announced the company is now offering product packaging and other services to businesses in Central Florida from its newest location in Orange City. JKG Group provides product packaging services that include design, prototyping, printing, finishing, storage, kitting and fulfillment for products ranging from health, beauty and other personal care items, to jewelry, handbags and luxury retail goods, to sample packs and sachets used for promotional purposes.\n\"Custom product packaging is one of our specialties, and we've developed outstanding designs for well-known national cosmetics and beauty products firms as well as for some very creative entrepreneurs right here in South Florida,\" said Adam Gittlin, president of JKG Group . \"The product packaging market is robust and dynamic, and we're pleased to be able to extend our expertise to formulators, laboratories, retailers and entrepreneurs in the Orlando and Tampa markets.\"\nAfter topping $25 Billion in 2016, the global market for personal care packaging alone is expected to reach $34.3 Billion by 2022 and $44.2 Billion by 2024, according to independent research reports by Research and Markets and Variant Market Research.\nProduct packaging serves many functions. Great packaging captures buyer attention on crowded shelves to increase a brand's competitive edge. Refreshed packaging can breathe new life into existing products, and exciting new designs are vital to introduce new products.
