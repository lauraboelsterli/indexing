Total distance: 305.066km (56 laps) \n2017 pole: Lewis Hamilton (Britain) Mercedes — One minute 31.678 seconds. \n2017 winner: Hamilton \nRace lap record: Michael Schumacher (Germany) Ferrari 1:32.238 (2004) \nStart time: 0610 GMT (1410 local) RACE WINS \nHamilton has 62 victories from 210 races and is second in the all-time list behind seven-times world champion Michael Schumacher (91). Vettel has 49. \nFerrari have won 231 races since 1950, McLaren 182, Williams 114, Mercedes 76 and Red Bull 55. Former champions McLaren and Williams have not won since 2012. \nVettel has won the first two races of the season. The last Ferrari driver to do that was Schumacher in 2004. POLE POSITION \nHamilton has a record 73 career poles. Vettel has 51. \nMax Verstappen, at 20 years old, can become the youngest ever pole sitter this season. The current youngest is Vettel, who did it at the age of 21. PODIUM \nHamilton has 119 career podiums and is second on the all-time list behind Schumacher (155). Vettel has 101, Kimi Raikkonen 92. POINTS \nHamilton can set an all-time Formula One record of 28 scoring finishes in a row, having equalled Raikkonen’s previous best of 27. \nThree drivers on the grid have yet to score points in their F1 careers: Rookies Charles Leclerc (Sauber) and Sergey Sirotkin(Williams) and Toro Rosso’s Brendon Hartley. \nPierre Gasly’s fourth place in Bahrain for Toro Rosso was his first top-10 finish. \nSauber’s Marcus Ericsson also scored his first points since 2015 in that race. CHINA \nThe race made its debut on the calendar in 2004 and nine of the 14 Chinese Grands Prix have been won from pole. \nHamilton is the most successful with five wins (2008, 2011, 2014, 2015, 2017), and is the only driver to have won two years in a row. \nFernando Alonso has won twice in China (2005, 2013), Vettel and team mate Kimi Raikkonen once each. \nMercedes have won five times, Ferrari four. \nThe circuit saw Red Bull’s first F1 win in 2009. MILESTONE \nVettel won in Bahrain on his 200th start. \nMercedes’ Valtteri Bottas will be making his 100th race start this weekend. \nMcLaren have now gone 100 races since their last victory in 2012.
