He has also served as executive vice president of International Management Group (IMG), and was co-managing director of IMG’s worldwide licensing and consumer products division where he signed numerous corporate, celebrity and media brands.\n“Tim is a fantastic addition to our advisory board, with unmatched resources and depth of knowledge in the world of consumer products and licensing,” said Robert Tallack, CEO of ConversionPoint Technologies. \"We expect Tim to introduce new opportunities to apply our e-Commerce technologies in the immensely profitable licensed products arena, as well make introductions to large-scale retail e-commerce companies as potential managed services clients.”\n“His proven business acumen will also be an asset as we build these relationships,” added Tallack, “and especially as we take ConversionPoint to its next level of growth and development.”\nPrior to IMG, Rothwell was the president of Marvel Entertainment’s WW Consumer Products division, managing its $5 billion licensing business.

What I saw with ConversionPoint’s technologies, specifically their AI and ability to drive key metrics, really got me excited to share them with companies I know can use their services. The reach and ROI ConversionPoint will be able to bring to these companies will be greatly impactful,” commented Rothwell.\nNoted for his entrepreneurial spirit, Rothwell has also held executive roles in the apparel industry with VF Corporation and Cherokee Apparel, where he was responsible for managing sales and marketing of a wide range products to key retailers, including department, specialty and mass-market stores, and retail chains.\nAbout ConversionPoint Technologies\nConversionPoint Technologies, Inc. is a group of e-Commerce technology companies that are changing how brands, advertisers and agencies connect with, acquire and retain customers.
