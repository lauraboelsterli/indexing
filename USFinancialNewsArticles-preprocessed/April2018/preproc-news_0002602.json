    "text": "By Chris Morris 10:50 AM EDT \nSilicon Valley was shocked by Tuesday’s workplace shooting at YouTube where four people were wounded and the suspected shooter took her own life. \nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai wrote a letter to all the employees of Google soon after the incident, calling it an “unimaginable tragedy” and a “horrific act of violence.” \nPichai’s peers quickly rallied around him, with leaders of some of the nation’s biggest tech companies expressing sympathy for the victims (and other employees), outrage that it happened, and gratitude to law enforcement officials. \nBeyond his internal memo, Pichai offered some public thoughts, as did YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki. There are no words to describe the tragedy that occurred today. @SusanWojcicki & I are focused on supporting our employees & the @YouTube community through this difficult time together. Thank you to the police & first responders for their efforts, and to all for msgs of support. \n— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) April 3, 2018 There are no words to describe how horrible it was to have an active shooter @YouTube today. Our deepest gratitude to law enforcement & first responders for their rapid response. Our hearts go out to all those injured & impacted today. We will come together to heal as a family. \n— Susan Wojcicki (@SusanWojcicki) April 4, 2018 \nFrom there, tech company CEOs from Amazon’s Jeff Bezos to Uber’s Dara Khosrowshahi were quick to offer their thoughts. From everyone at Apple, we send our sympathy and support to the team at YouTube and Google, especially the victims and their families. \n— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) April 3, 2018 We can’t keep being reactive to this, thinking and praying it won’t happen again at our schools, jobs, or our community spots. It’s beyond time to evolve our policies. This is a simple and reasonable approach, and it won’t solve all, but it’s a good start: https://t.co/ADYalbaO57 https://t.co/nbXpH9DDyT ",
