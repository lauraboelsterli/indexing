    "text": "LaMarcus Aldridge scored 28 points and Manu Ginobili came off the bench for 10 of his 17 points in the fourth quarter in the San Antonio Spurs’ 116-105 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers Saturday night at AT&T Center.\nGinobili was 7-for-7 from the field — 3-for-3 from 3-point range — in helping the Spurs claim their 10th straight win at home.\nDamian Lillard scored 33 points for the Trail Blazers, who lost their third straight game. Evan Turner added 18 points and CJ McCollum 17 for Portland.\nLillard had 18 points and McCollum 13 as Portland took a 56-54 lead into intermission. Aldridge scored 14 points on 7-for-9 shooting for San Antonio, which shot .564 from the field in the first half.\nSan Antonio took a 66-61 early in the third quarter. The Spurs carried a 81-77 edge into the final period.\nAldridge converted a three-point play to give San Antonio a 93-87 lead with 7:29 remaining. McCollum’s 17-footer cut the margin to 93-89. Ginobili followed with eight straight points — back-to-back 3-pointers and a driving layup — to make it 101-89 with 6:02 to play.\nJusuf Nurkic hit a layup to cut it to 101-91 with 5:24 to go, but Aldridge converted another three-point play for a 104-91 Spurs lead with 5:13 left.\nTurner’s three-point play brought Portland to within 104-94 with 5:02 remaining. Turner followed with a runner to make it 104-96 with 4:06 to play. Patty Mills then knocked down a three to give San Antonio a 106-96 advantage with 3:43 left. Aldridge scored on a put-back to up the lead to 108-96 with three minutes to go.\nTurner scored on a drive to cut the difference to 109-98, but Kyle Anderson’s driving layup hiked the Spurs’ lead to 111-98. Lillard followed with a three to get the Blazers to within 111-101, but they would get no closer.\nLillard scored 11 points — including three 3-point baskets — to stake Portland to a 33-32 lead after one quarter.\nThe Blazers jumped ahead 47-41 midway through the second quarter, then settled for a two-point advantage at the half.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
