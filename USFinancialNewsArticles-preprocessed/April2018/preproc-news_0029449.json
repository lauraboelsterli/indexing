    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. equity index futures rose on Sunday as financial market trading resumed for the first time since the United States, Britain and France hit Syria with missile strikes in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack.\nFILE PHOTO - A specialist trader works at his post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, (NYSE) in New York, U.S., March 22, 2018. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid The move suggested Wall Street was set to shrug off the attack and Russian President Vladimir Putinâ€™s warning on Sunday that further Western attacks on Syria would bring chaos to world affairs.\nIn the first few minutes of trading on Sunday evening, S&P 500 e-mini futures ESv1 were up by about 0.6 percent. Futures tracking the Nasdaq Composite Index and Dow Jones Industrial Average were up by comparable amounts.\nFutures tracking safe-haven U.S. Treasury securities were slightly lower.\nU.S. stocks fell on Friday as results from big banks failed to enthuse and worries over the Syria situation, but major market benchmarks gained ground on the week.\nReporting by Dan Burns; Editing by Peter Cooney\n ",
