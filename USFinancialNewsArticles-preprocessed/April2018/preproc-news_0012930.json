    "text": "EditorsNote: Tweaks throughout\nAuston Matthews collected one goal and one assist and goalie Frederik Andersen stopped 31 shots as the Toronto Maple Leafs beat the Montreal Canadiens 4-2 in NHL action Saturday night in Toronto in their final tune-up for the Stanley Cup Playoffs.\nThe Maple Leafs set a franchise record with a 105-point season and completed a four-game sweep of their Original Six rival while Andersen set a franchise record for most wins by a Toronto goalie with 38.\nMatthews opened the scoring at Air Canada Centre with a power-play goal coming with 1:55 remaining in the opening period. He was in the left circle when William Nylander made a brilliant no-look, cross-ice pass that left the rising star all kinds of net to hit behind Canadiens goalie Carey Price for his 34th goal in 62 games this season.\nDaniel Carr drew the Canadiens even at 16:04 of the second period, during a crazy scramble while Andersen couldn’t control the puck.\nMatthews, the first overall choice in the 2016 NHL Draft, also had a hand in Zach Hyman’s go-ahead goal 37 seconds into the third period that made it a 2-1 game. Price stopped Matthews’ long shot, but Hyman pounced on the rebound.\nMatthews, who finished the season with 63 points, has collected six goals and 12 points in a nine-game streak compiled since returning from a shoulder injury.\nNazem Kadri’s power-play tally with 2:50 remaining on the clock ended up the game-winner. Kadri lifted a top-shelf backhand from the doorstep for his 32nd goal of the season, which equals his career best.\nMontreal’s Jeff Petry scored on the power play with 41 seconds left in regulation, but Toronto’s Patrick Marleau iced the affair with 10 seconds left by taking advantage of Price’s miscue playing the puck and was able to convert into an open net.\nPrice made 26 saves for the Canadiens.\nThe Maple Leafs finished third in the Atlantic Division and will face either the Tampa Bay Lightning or Boston Bruins in the first round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. If the Bruins beat the Florida Panthers on Sunday, the Maple Leafs will face the Tampa Bay Lightning.\n— Field Level Media\n ",
