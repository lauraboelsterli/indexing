    "text": "April 9, 2018 / 7:29 AM / Updated an hour ago Russian military says Israeli war planes struck Syrian air base: Ifax Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nMOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian military said on Monday that two Israeli F-15 war planes had carried out strikes on a Syrian air base on Sunday, the Interfax news agency reported. \nInterfax cited the Russian Defence Ministry as saying the Israeli war planes had carried out the strikes from Lebanese air space, and that Syrian air defense systems had shot down five of eight missiles fired. \nAsked about the Russian statement, an Israeli military spokesman said he had no immediate comment. \nSyrian state TV said on Monday the United States was suspected of striking an air base hours after U.S. President Donald Trump warned of a “big price to pay” as aid groups said dozens of people were killed by poison gas in a rebel-held town.
