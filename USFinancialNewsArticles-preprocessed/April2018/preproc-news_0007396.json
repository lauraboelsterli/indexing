    "text": "0 COMMENTS Overstock.com Inc. OSTK -0.28% finance chief Robert Hughes is leaving his post to serve in the same role at a blockchain-technology joint venture that involves Overstock’s chief executive. \nMr. Hughes is joining DeSoto Inc., which Overstock said involves Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, Medici Ventures Inc., and Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto. DeSoto is working to develop a global property-registry system using a blockchain-based system to surface the property rights of people in the developing world.\nOverstock said Friday that Gregory J. Iverson, who previously served as CFO for Apollo Education Group Inc., will become its new finance chief. Mr. Iverson, 42 years old, will join the company April 16. Mr. Iverson worked at Apollo from April 2007 to March of this year, and became CFO there in October 2015.\nMr. Iverson’s annual salary will be $400,000, and he will receive a stock award and be eligible for compensation and benefits available to senior officers, the company said.\nThe CFO change at Overstock comes after the online retailer earlier this week canceled a secondary offering of four million shares, citing “market volatility.” President Saum Noursalehi said in a statement on Monday the company will “continue to pursue other strategic options.”\nOverstock shares rose 0.6% in morning trading.\nWrite to Bowdeya Tweh at Bowdeya.Tweh@wsj.com",
