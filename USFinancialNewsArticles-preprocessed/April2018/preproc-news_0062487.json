    "text": "Didi Gregorius’ home run in the top of the 10th inning lifted the New York Yankees to a 4-3 win over the Los Angeles Angels on Friday night at Angel Stadium.\nGregorius’ 10th homer of the season off Angels reliever Blake Parker (0-1) capped a comeback that saw New York score once in the ninth to tie the game before Gregorius hit his game-winner, his third hit of the night.\nDavid Robertson (1-0) got the win with a scoreless ninth, and Aroldis Chapman pitched the 10th for his fifth save.\nThe Angels took a 1-0 lead in the second inning on Shohei Ohtani’s solo homer off Yankees starter Luis Severino, Ohtani hitting a 97-mph fastball out for his fourth homer of the season.\nAngels starter Andrew Heaney kept the Yankees scoreless until the fifth inning when Aaron Hicks’ sacrifice fly tied the game at 1.\nThe Yankees threatened to break the game open in the sixth, putting runners on second and third with one out. Angels reliever Jim Johnson, who entered the game earlier in the inning to replace Heaney, gave up a deep fly ball to Neil Walker that appeared would leave the yard for a three-run home run.\nBut right fielder Kole Calhoun made a home run-saving catch, then doubled up Giancarlo Stanton at second for an inning-ending double play. However, Gregorius, tagging from third, crossed home plate before the out was recorded at second, and the Yankees had a 2-1 lead.\nAndrelton Simmons came up with a clutch hit in the seventh, his two-out, two-run triple to right field scoring Mike Trout and Albert Pujols to put the Angels up 3-2.\nSeverino finished the inning but was done after seven, giving up three runs on five hits and one walk, striking out eight.\nHeaney gave up two runs (one earned) on five hits and one walk, striking out nine in five-plus innings.\nCam Bedrosian pitched scoreless seventh and Justin Anderson a scoreless eighth for the Angels, setting up Keynan Middleton for the ninth.\nMiddleton, who entered the game 6-for-6 in save opportunities, walked Gary Sanchez to start the inning, then struck out Walker for the first out. Miguel Andujar followed with a double into the left field corner, Sanchez being held at third.\nAfter an intentional walk to Gleyber Torres, pinch hitter Brett Gardner hit a sacrifice fly to left field, scoring Sanchez to tie the game at 3.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
