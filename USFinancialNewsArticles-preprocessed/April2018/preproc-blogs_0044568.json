    "text": "0 COMMENTS Jeff Bezos: Amazon.com Inc. CEO; world's richest man; friend to handstand enthusiasts Photo: JASON REDMOND/AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE/GETTY IMAGES \nEvery week, CIO Journal offers a glimpse into the mind of the CEO, whose view of technology is shaped by stories in management journals, general interest magazines and, of course, in-flight publications. \nWhen the smartest person in the room is not up to the job. Karen Mazurkewich, marketing chief for Toronto-based innovation hub MaRS Discovery District argues that startup and technical business leaders often are not the best people to communicate their companies’ innovative breakthroughs. “The reasons are clear: technical breakthroughs are burdened by the weight of jargon, dragged down by clunky clauses and weighty words,” she writes in Harvard Business Review . In short: . The answer? Hire a professional wordsmith. “A good communications expert can help you translate your work so it relates to the world outside your lab, office, or facility,” says Ms. Mazurkewich, a former WSJ reporter. Plus they work for much less.\nThe smartest person in the room begs to differ.   uses part of his 2018 annual   to explain his philosophy on setting high standards. They are teachable, not intrinsic, and domain specific, not universal. Most important, teams and individuals pursuing high standards need to have a clear idea of the work required to get there. Mr. Bezos provides the example of writing company memos. At Amazon, staff meetings begin with the reading of a six-page memo, submitted by the team hosting the meeting. Some read like “angels singing,” he writes. Others don’t. “Often, when a memo isn’t great, it’s not the writer’s inability to recognize the high standard, but instead a wrong expectation on scope: they mistakenly believe a high-standards, six-page memo can be written in one or two days or even a few hours,” he writes.\nThe ultimate CEO read. Mr. Bezos certainly has put in the work. Over the years the reputation of his annual  –2018 marks the 20th edition–as a source of business excellence has grown to rival that of Warren Buffett’s. Readers may come for the news bits– Prime hits 100 million members –but they stick around for his take on long-term thinking, continuous learning and anecdotes like this year’s story about a friend who hired a coach to teach her the perfect handstand. Says the coach to the acolyte: “The reality is that it takes about six months of daily practice. If you think you should be able to do it in two weeks, you’re just going to end up quitting.” Point taken, Mr. Bezos. “You can really learn a lot by reading all of them,” Parsa Saljoughian, an investor at venture capital firm IVP, tells CNBC . He calls the collected works of letters “one of the best reads that anybody interested in business should read.”\nShare this: AMAZON JEFF BEZOS Previous Customer Experience Is the Key Competitive Differentiator in the Digital Age",
