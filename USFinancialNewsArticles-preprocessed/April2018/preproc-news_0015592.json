Panama cut its diplomatic ties with Taiwan in favour of Beijing in June last year.

It helps to continuously strengthen the relationship with our allies,” Taiwan Defence Ministry spokesman Chen Chung-chi said on Tuesday. \nThis was the sixth time Taiwan’s navy had visited Nicaragua. The whole trip will take two to three months, Chen said.
