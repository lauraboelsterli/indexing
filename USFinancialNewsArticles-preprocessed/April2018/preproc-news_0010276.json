    "text": "WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- PerkinElmer, Inc. (NYSE: PKI), a global leader committed to innovating for a healthier world, announced today that it has priced an offering of €300 million aggregate principal amount of 0.600% Senior Notes due 2021 at an issue price of 99.950% of the principal amount.\nThe issuance of the notes is expected to close on April 11, 2018, subject to customary closing conditions. The notes will pay interest on an annual basis.\nPerkinElmer plans to use the net proceeds of the offering to repay all of the $200 million aggregate principal amount outstanding under its term loan facility and to repay a portion of the aggregate principal amount outstanding under its revolving credit facility, in each case incurred to pay a portion of the purchase price of its acquisition of EUROIMMUN Medizinische Labordiagnostika AG, which closed on December 19, 2017. PerkinElmer expects to use any remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nThe book-running manager for the offering is J.P. Morgan Securities plc.\nThe offering is being made pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-3 (including a prospectus) filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Prospective investors should read the prospectus forming a part of that registration statement and the prospectus supplement related to the offering and the other documents that PerkinElmer has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the company and this offering. These documents are available at no charge by visiting EDGAR on the SEC website at www.sec.gov . Alternatively, copies of the prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus relating to the offering can be obtained by calling J.P. Morgan Securities plc collect at +44 (0)207-134-2468.\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the notes, nor shall there be any offer, solicitation or sale of the notes in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.\nThe prospectus in the registration statement and the prospectus supplement relating to the offering have been prepared on the basis that any offer of notes in any Member State of the European Economic Area (each, a “Member State”) will be made pursuant to an exemption under Directive 2003/71/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 4 November 2003 as amended (the “Prospectus Directive”) from the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. Accordingly, any person making or intending to make an offer in a Member State of notes which are the subject of the offering contemplated in the prospectus supplement may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for PerkinElmer or the underwriter to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article 16 of the Prospectus Directive, in each case, in relation to such offer. Neither we nor the book-running manager has authorized, nor do we authorize, the making of any offer of notes in circumstances in which an obligation arises for us or the underwriter to publish or supplement a prospectus for such offer.\nThe prospectus in the registration statement and the prospectus supplement relating to the offering are for distribution only to persons who (i) have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (as amended, the “Financial Promotion Order”), (ii) are persons falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.”) of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii) are outside the United Kingdom, or (iv) are persons to whom an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000) in connection with the issue or sale of any securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”). The prospectus in the registration statement and the prospectus supplement relating to the offering are directed only at relevant persons and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which such documents relate is available only to relevant persons and will be engaged in only with relevant persons.\nRelevant stabilization regulations including ICMA apply.\nAbout PerkinElmer\nPerkinElmer, Inc. is a global leader committed to innovating for a healthier world. The Company reported revenue of approximately $2.3 billion in 2017, has about 11,000 employees serving customers in more than 150 countries, and is a component of the S&P 500 Index.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, but not limited to, statements about the company’s intended use of proceeds. These statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from currently anticipated results, including risks and uncertainties relating to capital markets conditions and completion of the offering.
