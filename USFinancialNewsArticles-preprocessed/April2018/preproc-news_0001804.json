    "text": "MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Migrants forming a caravan in southern Mexico are subject to an administrative migratory procedure, the Mexican foreign ministry said on Monday, after the caravan drew the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump.\nCentral American migrants participating in a caravan heading to the U.S. take a pause from the journey in Matias Romero, Oaxaca, Mexico April 2, 2018. REUTERS/Jose de Jesus Cortes In a statement, the ministry said that the U.S. government must determine whether it would allow any of the migrants from the caravan into the United States.\n“It is not up to this government to make migration decisions for the United States or for any other nation,” the ministry said.\nThe ministry also said it did not foster illegal migration “under any circumstances”.\nReporting by Dave Graham; writing by Julia Love\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
