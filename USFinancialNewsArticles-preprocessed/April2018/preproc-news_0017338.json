    "text": "7 COMMENTS Stock-market swings in the past week have many investors scrambling to profit from the return of turbulence after a prolonged period of tranquility.\nRising interest rates, budding fears of inflation, the prospect of a trade war and a rout in technology stocks have dragged U.S. stocks lower and spurred one of the most sustained bouts of market volatility in years. Before Thursday, the S&P 500 index had gained or lost at least 1% during eight of the previous nine trading sessions.\nThe return of volatility was on display Wednesday when the Dow Jones Industrial Average swung by 741 points, plunging at the start amid fears of trade disruptions between the U.S. and China before reversing course with a gain of almost 1% as those fears subsided.\nMajor stock indexes continued their rebound on Thursday, when the S&P 500 advanced 0.7%, while the Dow gained 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.5%. Traders are bracing for another active day of trading Friday, after President Donald Trump late Thursday said he was considering slapping tariffs on another $100 billion in Chinese imports , sending stock-index futures tumbling in after-hours trading.\nThat turbulence is a sharp reversal from the sustained period of calm that kept the Cboe Volatility Index, Wall Street’s fear gauge, near record lows. The stock market’s steady upward slog made bulls out of even the most bearish bubble spotters. Jeremy Grantham, a Boston money manager famed for predicting past market peaks, declared in January that U.S. stocks would “melt up” another 50% over the next six months to two years. So far, at least, he was wrong.\nRelated\nTrump’s New Tariff Threat Drags Down Stocks Now that stocks, bonds and other assets are moving in strange ways, many investors view continued volatility as one of the year’s most dependable bets. The Cboe index, known as the VIX, is up 72% since the start of the year.\n“The new safe haven is now volatility,” said Christopher Stanton, chief investment officer at California-based Sunrise Capital LLC. “It’s the one thing that’s pretty much guaranteed.”\nMr. Stanton is among those who are buying futures contracts pegged to the VIX, a profitable bet if volatility continues to rise. In the past two weeks, both hedge funds and asset managers have been doing the same, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\nThe VIX uses S&P 500 options to measure traders’ short-term expectations for market swings. The gauge typically rises when stocks fall, making VIX derivatives an attractive form of protection against sudden downturns. One exchange-traded product that tracks VIX futures has gained 68% so far this year, according to FactSet.\n“A small amount of this stuff can be a very potent hedge,” Mr. Stanton said.\nSome investors are buying stock options that make more money amid violent market swings, regardless of whether stocks rise or fall, said Pravit Chintawongvanich, head of derivatives strategy for Macro Risk Advisors.\n“There’s definitely been a change in market psychology,” he said. “This is the first time in years when volatility has jumped and remained high.”\nBig banks like Goldman Sachs and Société Générale are urging clients to protect their portfolios from looming threats like trade disruptions and higher interest rates by using strategies that benefit from increased turbulence.\n“Hedge what you fear,” Goldman Sachs wrote in an April 2 report. “A shift towards risk reduction and expectation of higher volatility is likely to change the trading dynamics in 2018 and increase the value of time spent on hedging.”\nBuying this insurance against wild price swings had fallen out of favor in the years since the financial crisis, especially in 2017 when stock-market volatility fell to its lowest level since the index was launched in 1993. The VIX just finished its calmest year, pushing some investors to ditch costly portfolio insurance.\nA single share of the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN , which profits when VIX futures rise, bought at its 2009 launch was worth $107,090, after adjusting for splits, according to FactSet. It closed at $46.96 Thursday.\nInstead, many investors juiced returns by selling insurance. Betting against volatility was one of the most popular and profitable trades in recent years as central banks flooded the markets with cash and lulled investors with record-low interest rates.\nBut that strategy imploded on Feb. 5 when stocks plunged and VIX futures rose almost 113%, their biggest one-day gain since the contracts started trading in 2004. Exchange-traded funds that bet against the VIX lost more than 80% of their assets, and two popular products were shuttered. Since the start of February, asset managers have slashed wagers on falling VIX futures by 83% while hedge funds cut 41%, according to the CFTC.\nDespite the renewed interest in betting on more volatility, profiting from it isn’t all that easy. Investors must time the bets with precision, and be equally adept at cashing out at the right moment, analysts say—a difficult task.\nA group of hedge funds—known as tail-risk funds—that claim to protect investors from sudden declines have struggled to make gains from the recent surge in market turbulence . The Cboe Eurekahedge Hedge Fund index of tail-risk funds fell 0.3% in February and eked out a gain of 0.2% in March, even though volatility surged.\nStocks may yet rocket higher, as predicted in January by Mr. Grantham, the chief investment strategist at Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo & Co.\nStill, history shows that buying volatility can prove expensive, even when turbulence is elevated, said Salil Aggarwal, equity derivatives strategist at Deutsche Bank .\n“It’s very hard to make money being systematically long volatility,” Mr. Aggarwal said. “Over time you’re going to bleed away money.”\nWrite to Asjylyn Loder at asjylyn.loder@wsj.com , Ira Iosebashvili at ira.iosebashvili@wsj.com and Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.Banerji@wsj.com",
