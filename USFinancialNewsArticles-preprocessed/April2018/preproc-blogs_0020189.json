She was a famous actress in Egypt, and I was living all over the place, in hotels, not seeing her. And I was afraid that I‚Äôd fall in love with some dizzy blonde and leave my beloved wife for her.‚Äù 1965: Egyptian actor Omar Sharif, wearing a torn shirt and wrist manacles, in a still from director Henry Levin's film, 'Ghengis Khan'.
