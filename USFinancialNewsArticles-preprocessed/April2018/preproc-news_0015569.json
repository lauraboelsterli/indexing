    "text": "LAM expands its alternative investment platform\nNEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Lazard Asset Management LLC (LAM), today announced that David Gibson has joined the firm as a Managing Director. Mr. Gibson will lead a New York-based team, which will implement a hybrid strategy at the intersection of human- and algorithmic-driven investment approaches.\n“David brings a wealth of both fundamental and quantitative investment experience, a unique investment philosophy, and a rigorous investment process that we expect will benefit our clients,” said Loren Katzovitz, Managing Director at LAM, who is responsible for initiatives to grow its global alternatives platform. “We continue to focus on expanding our alternative investment platform to offer clients differentiated products that provide superior risk-adjusted returns with low correlation to traditional asset classes.”\nMr. Gibson spent 20 years as an investment professional with hedge fund D. E. Shaw & Co. in New York, London and Mumbai. In addition to serving as a portfolio manager, he assumed a number of broader leadership roles, including a multi-year assignment to Mumbai as CEO of D.E. Shaw’s joint venture with Reliance Industries. Most recently, Mr. Gibson served as Managing Partner at Assiduous Investments, LLC, which he founded in 2015.\n“Lazard’s strong presence in both discretionary and systematic investing complements my approach, which combines two traditionally discrete disciplines,” said Mr. Gibson. “Lazard’s platform provides state-of-the-art global infrastructure, including world class distribution, which allows us to focus on portfolio management and investment research.”\nLAM is expected to launch a new market-neutral equity investment strategy in the second half of 2018.\nAbout Lazard Asset Management (LAM) LLC\nAn indirect subsidiary of Lazard Ltd (NYSE: LAZ), LAM offers a range of equity, fixed income, and alternative investment products worldwide.
