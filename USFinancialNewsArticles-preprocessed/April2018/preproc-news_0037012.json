    "text": "April 17, 2018 / 11:23 AM / Updated 4 minutes ago E.ON says all turbines linked to grid at UK offshore wind farm Rampion Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nLONDON, April 17 (Reuters) - All 116 turbines at top German utility E.ON’s Rampion offshore wind farm in Britain are now able to generate electricity and are delivering power to the grid, the company said on Tuesday. \nThe 400-megawatt project is being built off the coast of Sussex in southeast England by E.ON, UK Green Investment Rampion Ltd and Canadian energy infrastructure company Enbridge. \n“Over the coming months work will continue both on and offshore, to prepare the site for full operation later this year,” E.ON said in a statement. \nThe farm will generate electricity to supply 347,000 homes, equivalent to around half of the households in Sussex. \nIn March, British wind power output hit a record high at 14.2 gigawatts, accounting for about 34 percent of domestic electricity generation. Wind power is needed to bridge a supply gap as old nuclear plants and coal-fired power stations close. (Reporting by Sabina Zawadzki; Editing by Dale Hudson)",
