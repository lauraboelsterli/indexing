FILE PHOTO: BPCE group and Natixis Chairman Francois Perol attends the company's 2014 annual results presentation in Paris February 19, 2015. REUTERS/Christian Hartmann\nPerol chaired the management board of BPCE as well as the supervisory board of investment bank Natixis ( CNAT.PA ). His resignation comes almost a year after he was cleared by a French court in a conflict of interest case.\nLes Echos newspaper said Perol, who worked as a top adviser to former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, will join merchant bank Rothschild & Cie.\nNatixis said Francois Riahi, who joined the BPCE group in 2009, would be its new CEO from June 1, while Mignon would become chairman of Natixis’ board of directors.
