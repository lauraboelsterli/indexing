The addition of Chris Chang and the Dumortier team to Alliant adds well-known expertise in representing marquee hotel franchises and their owners,” said Tom Corbett, Chairman and CEO of Alliant. “Hospitality owners count on Chris and her team to build master insurance programs that streamline coverage and significantly reduce their insurance costs.”\nThe strong cultural ties to Taiwan and China made the acquisition of the Dumortier agency a natural progression in the expansion of the Alliant Real Estate practice from the United States to Asia and beyond. The addition of Dumortier with employees who speak Chinese, Taiwanese, Greek, Spanish, French, and English also serves as a cultural differentiator for Alliant.\nFounded in 2002, Dumortier represents more than 200 hotel owners and developers. All of the agency’s professionals have joined Alliant’s Real Estate group in its Los Angeles office.\nTerms of the transaction were not disclosed.\nAbout Alliant Insurance Services\nHeadquartered in Newport Beach, CA, Alliant Insurance Services, Inc. provides property and casualty, workers’ compensation, employee benefits, surety, and financial products and services to clients nationwide, including public entities, tribal nations, healthcare, energy, law firms, real estate, construction, and other industry groups.
