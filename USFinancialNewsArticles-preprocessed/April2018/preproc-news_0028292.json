(“Goodfood” or “the Company”) (TSX:FOOD), a leader in the Canadian meal-kit industry, today announced strong financial results for the second quarter ended February 28, 2018.\nActive subscribers reached 61,000 as at February 28, 2018, up from 13,000 as at February 28, 2017. During the second quarter, Goodfood added 16,000 net new subscribers, an increase of 36% from November 30, 2017.\n“We continued to experience rapid organic growth in Eastern Canada where our targeted marketing approach, combined with the launch of additional recipes and plan options, is generating strong results. As a result, our operations were profitable in several core markets and our gross merchandise sales for the last 12 months has reached almost $50 million. On an annualized basis, our gross merchandise sale run-rate is now approaching the $100 million mark,” said Jonathan Ferrari, Chief Executive Officer of Goodfood.\n“With the launch of our national platform, the Goodfood experience will be available from coast to coast this quarter. Our Western Canada pre-launch has been extremely well received and we now have over 2,000 active subscribers in the region. The official launch of our service offering in Western Canada will significantly expand our addressable market, adding 11 million new potential customers. We are confident that as we roll-out our marketing initiatives, we will replicate the success we have achieved in Eastern Canada,” added Jonathan Ferrari.\nFinancial Highlights\n(Unaudited all amounts are in Canadian dollars)\nFor the periods ended February 28, 2018 and 2017\nQ2 2018\nQ2 2017\nChange\nYTD 2018\nYTD 2017\nChange\nRevenue\nGrowth %\n15,672,647 3,686,947 11,985,700\n325% 26,908,529 5,879,415 21,029,114\n358% Gross Profit\nGross margin %\n2,823,860\n18.0% 894,224\n24.3% 1,929,636\n(6.3) pts 4,884,124\n18.2% 1,222,597\n20.8% 3,661,527\n(2.6) pts Gross Merchandise Sales 1\n18,840,295 4,280,431 14,559,864\n340% 32,115,295 6,836,217 25,279,078\n370% Adjusted Gross Profit\nAdjusted Gross margin % 1\n5,991,508\n31.8% 1,487,708\n34.8% 4,503,800\n(3.0) pts 10,090,890\n31.4% 2,179,399\n31.9% 7,911,491\n(0.5) pts Net Loss\n(2,394,604) (1,766,488) (628,116) (4,914,437) (4,879,302) (35,135) Adjusted net loss 1\n(2,394,604) (207,887) (2,186,717) (4,801,340) (629,584) (4,171,756)\n1 See the non-IFRS financial measures section below\nRevenue and Gross Merchandise Sales\nGross merchandise sale increased by 42% during the quarter while Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by only 15.9%. The gross merchandise sales run-rate reached $90.6 million at the end of the second quarter of 2018. Revenue for the second quarter grew 325% to $15.7 million compared to $3.7 million for the corresponding period of 2017 and grew 39% when compared to $11.2 million for the first quarter of 2018. Gross merchandise sales for the second quarter, which reflects the total retail value of merchandise sold by Goodfood before taking into account all incentives and credits, totaled $18.8 million compared to $4.3 million for the corresponding period of 2017 and $13.3 million for the first quarter of 2018.\nRevenue for the first half of 2018 grew 358% to $26.9 million compared to $5.9 million in the corresponding period of 2017. The increase in revenue for the second quarter and for the first half of 2018 compared to the corresponding periods of 2017 is primarily driven by the continued growth in the number of Active subscribers. Gross merchandise sales for the first half of 2018 increased to $32.1 million compared to $6.8 million for the corresponding period of 2017.\nGross Margin and Adjusted Gross Margin\nGross margin was 18.0% and 18.2% for the second quarter and first half of 2018 respectively, compared to 24.3% and 20.8% for the corresponding periods of 2017. The decrease in gross margin primarily resulted from an increase in production labour costs, start up expenses for Western Canada operations and higher overhead costs coming from our new Eastern Canada facility. The company expects that fixed costs as a percentage of revenue will decrease over time with the Company’s continued growth. Gross margin in the second quarter of 2018 decreased slightly from 18.3% to 18.0% compared to the first quarter of 2018. The Company saw an improvement in Eastern Canada gross margin while start-up costs related to Western Canada led to an overall decline in gross margin.\nAdjusted gross margin was 31.8% and 31.4% for the second quarter and first half of 2018 respectively, compared to 34.8% and 31.9% for the corresponding periods of 2017. Adjusted gross margin in the second quarter of 2018, which included start-up costs related to Western Canada, improved to 31.8% compared to 30.9% in the first quarter of 2018.\nAdjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Net Loss per Share\nAdjusted net loss for the second quarter was $2.4 million, or $0.05 per share (basic and diluted), compared to an adjusted net loss of $0.2 million, or $0.01 per share (basic and diluted) for the corresponding period of 2017. The increase in adjusted net loss was mainly due to planned investments in administrative expenses to support continued subscriber growth and an increased marketing budget. Adjusted net loss excludes a loss on the remeasurement of convertible notes of $1.6 million recorded in the second quarter of 2017.\nAdjusted net loss for the first half of 2018 was $4.8 million, or $0.10 per share (basic and diluted), compared to an adjusted net loss of $0.6 million, or $0.03 per share (basic and diluted) for Fiscal 2017. The increase in adjusted net loss was mainly due to planned investments in administrative expenses to support continued subscriber growth and an increased marketing budget. Adjusted net loss excludes a loss on the disposal of fixed assets of $0.1 million recorded in the first half of 2018 and a loss on the remeasurement of convertible notes of $4.2 million recorded in the corresponding period of 2017.\nManagement Appointments\nDuring the quarter, the Company announced the appointment of Philippe Adam as Chief Financial Officer effective March 23, 2018. Philippe brings over 15 years of experience in corporate finance, accounting and operations. He has been involved in a wide variety of strategic matters over the years including mergers and acquisitions, cross border transactions and debt and equity financing.\nNeil Cuggy, who has been acting as CFO since the inception of the Company, will focus on executing the Company’s operational, strategic and growth plan as President and Chief Operating Officer.\nOutlook\nThe meal-kit subscription service industry is one of the fastest growing industries in the world and remains relatively new in Canada. As a result, Goodfood believes that there are significant opportunities to rapidly grow its subscriber base by continuing to invest in highly targeted marketing campaigns, capacity expansion and in establishing a national platform. As the Company grows its subscriber base, it is confident that it can achieve further economies of scale which will lead to enhanced profitability. With the opening of its Western Canadian production facility in Q3, Management expects the Company to further expand its client base.\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2018 Results Conference Call:\nWhen: April 12, 2018 at 10:00 a.m. E.T\nDial in number: 647-788-4922 or 877-223-4471\nConference call replay available until April 26, 2018\n416-621-4642 or 1-800-585-8367\nTo access the webcast and view the slide presentation, click on this link: http://www.gowebcasting.com/9226 .\nThe conference ID is 1673089.\nA full version of the Company’s Second Quarter 2018 Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) and unaudited Interim Financial Statements will be posted on http://www.sedar.com later today.\nNon-IFRS Financial Measures\nCertain financial and non-financial measures included in this news release do not have a standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. The Company includes these measures because it believes they provide to certain investors a meaningful way of assessing financial performance. For a more complete description of these measures and a reconciliation of Goodfood's non-IFRS financial measures to financial results, please see Goodfood's Management's Discussion and Analysis for the three-month and sixth-month periods ended February 28, 2018.\nGoodfood's definition of the non-IFRS terms are as follows:\nAn active subscriber is defined as an account that will receive a delivery or has elected to skip a delivery in the subsequent weekly delivery cycle. Gross merchandise sales measures the total retail value of all goods sold by the Company before taking into account all incentives and credits. Gross merchandise sales run-rate is defined as gross merchandise sales for the four-week period ended as at the date indicated multiplied by thirteen. Management believes that gross merchandise sales run-rate is a useful measure of financial performance because it is indicative of gross merchandise sales on an annual basis for the Company's current level of active subscribers. Adjusted gross profit is calculated as gross merchandise sales less cost of goods sold. Adjusted gross margin is calculated as adjusted gross profit divided by gross merchandise sales. EBITDA is defined as net income or loss before net finance expenses, depreciation and amortization expense and income tax expense. Adjusted net loss is defined as net loss adjusted for items that Management believes do not necessarily arise as part of the Company’s normal day-to-day operations to better analyze trends in performance and financial results. These adjustments result in a truer economic representation of the underlying business on a comparative basis.\nAbout Goodfood\nGoodfood is Canada’s leading meal kit company, delivering fresh ingredients that make it easy for subscribers to prepare delicious meals at home every week.
