Investors are taking profits from the table,” said Saurabh Jain, AVP research at SMC Global Securities.\nFinancial stocks dropped, with HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank dragging down the indexes.\nThe Nifty metal index fell 1 percent, after gaining 7.8 percent in the past month on rising global prices.\nVedanta Ltd and Hindalco Industries Ltd declined over 1.5 percent each.\nThe Nifty IT index, however, rose as much as 1.6 percent as a weaker Indian rupee helped send shares of IT exporters higher.\nIndia’s top mobile carrier Bharti Airtel Ltd rose over 5 percent, after the company’s fourth quarter results beat expectations of a loss and as it approved a merger of its mobile masts unit with Indus Towers.
