    "text": "EMERYVILLE, Calif. and NEW YORK, April 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Harvest Properties, a full service commercial real estate investment, development, and management firm (\"Harvest\") and an affiliate of Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. (\"Cerberus\"), a global leader in alternative investing, announced today that they have acquired DC Station, an office property located in Daly City, California. The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver certified project is comprised of a nine-story, multi-tenant office building totaling approximately 383,000 square feet.\nDC Station was built in 2001 and is among the newest vintage style office properties in the surrounding area. The property features large floor plates with high ceilings and expanded window lines that offer unobstructed bay hill views. The property also includes a seven-level parking garage and is well located directly off of Interstate 280, adjacent to the Daly City BART Station.\n\"We are excited to complete our first transaction with global investment leader Cerberus,\" said John Winther, Managing Partner at Harvest Properties. \"Both Cerberus and Harvest see this as an opportunity to acquire a high quality property at a compelling price and, ultimately, add value through thoughtful leasing activity as we capitalize on the changing demand drivers in the area.\"\n\"This is an attractive investment opportunity for Cerberus given the property's accessibility, adjacency to mass transit, and Class A condition,\" said Tom Wagner, Co-Head of North American Real Estate and Senior Managing Director of Cerberus. \"Cerberus is excited to invest alongside an experienced partner like Harvest, and we are confident that together we will drive growing tenant interest in DC Station and enhance the property's value.\"\nIn addition to its location, the property benefits from a recently renovated double-height lobby, upgrades to the common areas and fitness center, and a newly constructed conference facility, creating a best-in-class project in the North Peninsula submarket.
