    "text": "Ramos brings broad strategic and operational experience rooted in service to the underserved\nBOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Rogerson Communities, one of Boston’s most venerable non-profit human service organizations, is pleased to announce that Walter J. Ramos will join the organization as President and CEO in July, 2018. Mr. Ramos, an accomplished and respected healthcare administrator, will succeed Rogerson’s current President and CEO, James F. Seagle, who led the organization for 45 years. Seagle will assume a new role at Rogerson, advocating on a national level for funding production of affordable housing, the platform for all “aging in community” services.\nOver the past four decades, Rogerson experienced phenomenal growth in both its portfolio and endowment with over $500 million in assets now under management. The organization grew from a single home for aged men to a multi-dimensional enterprise that now encompasses over 29 properties and programs throughout Greater Boston and beyond to Weymouth and Southeastern, MA. At this pivotal time in its 158 year history, Rogerson’s outstanding reputation, financial strength, and excellent leadership at staff and Board levels help position the organization to meet the many challenges ahead, including the rapidly growing need for housing and healthcare for aging Americans living on a fixed income.\nMr. Ramos brings more than twenty years of leadership experience in non-profit healthcare and municipal agencies to his role at Rogerson. Ramos will leave his current position as President of Carney Hospital, part of Steward Health Care, where he was responsible for setting the vision and ensuring effective leadership and management. He managed $128 million annual operating budget, orchestrating unprecedented financial turnaround for the long-struggling organization.\n“Walter is an excellent choice to take the reins and help Rogerson navigate the social economics of the coming decades,” said Seagle. “We are absolutely confident that he is the right leader for Rogerson as we embark on our next chapter with renewed focus, strong financials, strategic partnerships, and an incredible team of loyal staff, Board and donors.”\nBoard Chair Brit d'Arbeloff stated, “After a thorough year-long search process, we are thrilled to welcome Walter Ramos as CEO, an individual who deeply believes as we do, that everyone deserves to age with dignity in their community. Walter brings a stellar leadership reputation, a wealth of healthcare experience, and a lifelong passion for helping the underserved – all of which are critical ingredients in the continued evolution of our organization.”\nABOUT ROGERSON\nRogerson develops and manages affordable housing for low and moderate income elders throughout Greater Boston’s diverse neighborhoods. Through our independent housing and innovative health programs, Rogerson provides access to excellent opportunities for aging in community. Our housing, adult day health, fitness, and memory loss programs foster dignity, longevity, and vitality. Founded in 1860, Rogerson has always believed that where you live impacts how you live.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180402005278/en/\nRogerson Communities\nBarbara Quiroga, 617-413-3888\nBQ@QuirogaGroup.com\nSource: Rogerson Communities",
