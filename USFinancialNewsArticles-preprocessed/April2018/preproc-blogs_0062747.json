    "text": "0 COMMENTS Surging shares of McDonald’s lifted the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which was on track for its first monthly gain since January.\nThe Dow industrials rose 165 points, or 0.7%, to 24479 shortly after the opening bell. The index is up 1.6% in April, as a glut of strong earnings helped boost appetite for stocks and steady investors, who had been reeling from the broad losses major indexes suffered in February and March.\nA cocktail of factors ranging from concerns about the economy to trade tensions and rising geopolitical risks has caused stocks to swing wildly and dip into correction territory.\nOf the 267 companies reporting in the S&P 500 so far, 79% have posted results that beat analyst expectations, higher than the historical average of 64% and above the average over the past four quarters of 75%, according to Thomson Reuters.\n“Earnings so far have been solid. We needed a lot of these companies to deliver and they have,” said Eric Freedman, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.\nA ‘Charging Bull’ sculpture outside the New York Stock Exchange.

Photo: Mary Altaffer/Associated Press The S&P 500 climbed 0.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite also added 0.5%.\nShares of McDonald’s rose 4.3%, adding roughly 46 points to the Dow industrials to lead it higher after the fast-food franchisee said same-store sales and profit both rose in the latest quarter.\nApple’s stock was also moving higher, adding further support to the Dow’s gain on Monday ahead of the tech company’s quarterly earnings report on Tuesday. Shares of Apple rose 2.3%.\nTalks between South and North Korean leaders have also calmed nerves, with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un pledging over the weekend to shut down Pyongyang’s nuclear-test site.\nU.S. trade policy will be back in focus this week with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visiting China for high-level trade talks . The U.S. had earlier in 2018 threatened tariffs on $150 billion in Chinese goods and prohibitions on Chinese purchases of U.S. technology.\nMeanwhile, country exemptions on the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs expire Tuesday .\nMarket participants will also focus on the Federal Reserve’s meeting Wednesday and Friday’s U.S. April jobs report.\nThe 10-year U.S. Treasury yield edged lower to 2.957%, according to Tradeweb, from 2.959% on Friday. Rising bond yields have put pressure on stocks in recent weeks, with the 10-year Treasury hitting 3% for the first time in more than four years last Tuesday. Yields move inversely to prices.\n“We’d be more concerned if it hit 3.5%, but even at these levels it’s having an effect on markets,” Mr. Freedman said.\nRising yields have also boosted the dollar after the currency floundered for most of the past year. The greenback ranks as one of the currency market’s top performers in April.\nOn Monday, the WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of 16 currencies, was up 0.4%.\nHong Kong’s Hang Seng Index jumped 1.7%, while Singapore’s benchmark Straits Times Index hit a fresh 10-year high after a strong start to banks’ earnings season. Markets in China and Japan were closed for public holidays.\nCorrections & Amplifications\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the name of Singapore’s stock benchmark, the Straits Times Index.
