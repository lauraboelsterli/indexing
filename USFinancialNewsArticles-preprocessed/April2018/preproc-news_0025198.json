Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the U.N. Security Council on Friday that the United States, France and Britain were only interested in ousting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government and containing Russia. Russian Ambassador to the United Nations Vassily Nebenzia (L) and Bolivia's Ambassador to the United Nations Sacha Sergio Llorenty Soliz speak to the media outside Security Council chambers at the U.N. headquarters in New York, U.S., April 12, 2018. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton \n“We continue to observe dangerous military preparations for an illegal act of force against a sovereign state in what would constitute a breach of international law,” he said. “We call on the leadership of these states to immediately reconsider.” \n“The sole thing they have an interest in is to oust the Syrian government and more broadly to contain the Russian Federation,” he said.
