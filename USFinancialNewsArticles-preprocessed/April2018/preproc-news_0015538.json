Pursuant to the Stock Split, each shareholder of record as of the close of business on April 13, 2018 (the “ Record Date ”) will receive three additional common shares of Scythian. Scythian’s common shares are expected to begin trading ex-distribution on a split basis at the opening on April 12, 2018.\nThe Stock Split will increase the number of issued and outstanding common shares of the Company from 7,333,397 to 29,333,588.\nRegistered shareholders of Scythian as of the Record Date will be mailed new certificates or direct registration statements representing the additional common shares issued to them as a result of the Stock Split on or about April 17, 2018.
