    "text": "Highlights\nNet Earnings of $118.3 Million, or $0.93 Per Diluted Share Tax Equivalent Net Interest Margin of 5.11% Nonaccrual Loans and Leases Reduced by $52.1 million, or 33% in Q1’18 Classified Loans and Leases Reduced by $70.4 million, or 25% in Q1’18 Core Deposits at 87% of Total Deposits New Loan and Lease Production of $788.5 Million\nLOS ANGELES, PacWest Bancorp (Nasdaq:PACW) today announced net earnings for the first quarter of 2018 of $118.3 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, compared to net earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 of $84.0 million, or $0.66 per diluted share. The increase in net earnings from the prior quarter was primarily due to lower noninterest expense, lower income tax expense, higher noninterest income, and a lower provision for credit losses, offset partially by lower net interest income.\nNoninterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was lower due mainly to a decrease in acquisition, integration and reorganization costs of $16.1 million related to the CUB acquisition and integration completed in the fourth quarter of 2017. Income tax expense for the first quarter of 2018 was lower mainly due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which reduced our effective tax rate to 27.7% in the first quarter of 2018 from 40.2% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Noninterest income for the first quarter of 2018 increased by $11.8 million mainly due to a $9.6 million increase in the gain on sale of securities. In the first quarter of 2018 we sold certain securities for a net gain of $6.3 million, whereas in the fourth quarter of 2017, we made a tax-related decision to sell certain securities resulting in a net loss of $3.3 million. Net interest income declined by $6.5 million due mostly to two fewer days in the current quarter and a lower average loan and lease balance.\nMatt Wagner, President and CEO, commented, “Our performance in the first quarter was highlighted by significant earnings growth, solid margin expansion, and notable decreases in nonaccrual and classified loans and leases. Our de-risking activities have resulted in lower credit costs, improved credit quality metrics and a reduced reliance on higher-cost deposits and borrowings. Our first quarter results produced a return on assets of 1.99% and a return on tangible equity of 21.08%.”\nMr. Wagner continued, “Our first quarter tax equivalent NIM increased 14 basis points to 5.11%, benefitting from the repricing of variable-rate loans, higher loan fee income and higher recapture of nonaccrual interest. Our strong first quarter results make us optimistic that 2018 will be another positive year for the Company.”\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nAt or For the Three Months Ended March 31, December 31, Financial Highlights 2018 2017 Change (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net earnings $ 118,276 $ 84,037 $ 34,239 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.93 $ 0.66 $ 0.27 Return on average assets 1.99 % 1.34 % 0.65 Return on average tangible equity (1) 21.08 % 13.75 % 7.33 Net interest margin (tax equivalent) 5.11 % 4.97 % 0.14 Efficiency ratio 41.7 % 41.0 % 0.7 Total assets $ 24,149,330 $ 24,994,876 $ (845,546 ) Loans and leases held for investment, net of deferred fees $ 16,455,285 $ 16,972,743 $ (517,458 ) Noninterest-bearing deposits $ 8,232,140 $ 8,508,044 $ (275,904 ) Core deposits $ 15,661,529 $ 15,937,012 $ (275,483 ) Total deposits $ 18,078,788 $ 18,865,536 $ (786,748 ) Noninterest-bearing deposits as percentage of total deposits 46 % 45 % 1 Core deposits as percentage of total deposits 87 % 85 % 2 Equity to assets ratio 20.16 % 19.91 % 0.25 Tangible common equity ratio (1) 10.43 % 10.50 % (0.07 ) Book value per share $ 38.47 $ 38.65 $ (0.18 ) Tangible book value per share (1) $ 17.75 $ 18.24 $ (0.49 ) (1) Non-GAAP measure.\nINCOME STATEMENT HIGHLIGHTS\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income decreased by $6.5 million to $256.5 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $263.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 due mainly to two fewer days in the first quarter and a lower average loan and lease balance. The loan and lease yield was 6.11% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 5.89% for the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in the loan and lease yield was principally due to the repricing of variable-rate loans, higher loan fee income, and higher recapture of nonaccrual interest.\nThe tax equivalent NIM was 5.11% for the first quarter of 2018 compared to 4.97% for the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in the NIM was due mainly to the higher loan yield resulting from the repricing of variable-rate loans and higher loan fee income, which was partially offset by a decrease of six basis points resulting from a smaller tax equivalent adjustment due to the lower statutory federal tax rate.\nThe cost of average total deposits increased to 0.31% for the first quarter of 2018 from 0.30% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income increased by $11.8 million to $38.6 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $26.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 due mainly to a $9.6 million increase in the gain on sale of securities and a $2.6 million increase in the gain on sale of loans. During the first quarter of 2018, we sold $299.9 million of securities for a gain of $6.3 million. These securities were sold primarily for reinvestment in higher quality liquid assets, yield and credit risk purposes. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we made a tax-related decision to sell $172.6 million of securities and recognized a loss of $3.3 million to take advantage of the higher statutory federal tax rate in 2017. In addition, the gain on sale of loans increased by $2.6 million to $4.6 million for the first quarter of 2018 from $2.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2018 includes a $2.4 million gain resulting from the sale of our largest nonaccrual loan above our carrying value and $1.3 million related to the settlement of our December 31, 2017 loans held for sale of $481.1 million.\nThe following table presents details of noninterest income for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31, Increase Noninterest Income 2018 2017 (Decrease) (In thousands)\nService charges on deposit accounts $ 4,174 $ 4,574 $ (400 ) Other commissions and fees 10,265 10,505 (240 ) Leased equipment income 9,587 8,258 1,329 Gain on sale of loans and leases 4,569 1,988 2,581 Gain (loss) on sale of securities 6,311 (3,329 ) 9,640 Other income: Dividends and realized gains on equity investments 251 342 (91 ) Warrant income 248 831 (583 ) Other 3,154 3,626 (472 ) Total noninterest income $ 38,559 $ 26,795 $ 11,764\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense decreased by $15.5 million to $127.4 million for the first quarter of 2018 compared to $142.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 due mostly to a decrease in acquisition, integration and reorganization costs of $16.1 million related to the CUB acquisition. Other professional services decreased by $1.3 million due mostly to lower legal fees and internal audit costs. Compensation expense decreased by $1.0 million as the fourth quarter of 2017 included a charge of $2.9 million for separation costs in connection with exiting the origination operations related to general, technology, and healthcare cash flow loans partially offset by an increase in stock compensation expense and a seasonal increase in payroll tax expense. Intangible asset amortization increased by $1.3 million as a result of a full quarter of expense for the intangible assets related to the CUB acquisition. Other expense increased by $1.1 million due primarily to an increase in Community Reinvestment Act-related and corporate donations.\nThe following table presents details of noninterest expense for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31, Increase Noninterest Expense 2018 2017 (Decrease) (In thousands)\nCompensation $ 71,023 $ 71,986 $ (963 ) Occupancy 13,223 12,715 508 Data processing 6,659 6,764 (105 ) Other professional services 4,439 5,786 (1,347 ) Insurance and assessments 5,727 5,384 343 Intangible asset amortization 6,346 5,062 1,284 Leased equipment depreciation 5,375 5,048 327 Foreclosed assets income, net (122 ) (475 ) 353 Acquisition, integration and reorganization costs - 16,085 (16,085 ) Loan expense 2,271 3,140 (869 ) Other 12,454 11,373 1,081 Total noninterest expense $ 127,395 $ 142,868 $ (15,473 )\nIncome Taxes\nThe overall effective income tax rate was 27.7% for the first quarter of 2018 and 40.2% for the fourth quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was lower due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced the federal statutory corporate tax rate to 21% in the first quarter of 2018 from 35% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The effective tax rate for the full year 2018 is estimated to be approximately 28%.\nBALANCE SHEET HIGHLIGHTS\nLoans and Leases\nLoans and leases held for investment, net of deferred fees, decreased by $517.5 million in the first quarter of 2018 to $16.5 billion at March 31, 2018. The net decrease was driven mainly by payoffs of $974.5 million, paydowns of $936.0 million, and sales of $130.6 million, offset partially by new production of $788.5 million and disbursements of $747.4 million.\nThe following table presents a roll forward of loans and leases held for investment, net of deferred fees, for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended Loans and Leases March 31, December 31, Held for Investment Roll Forward (1) 2018 2017 (Dollars in thousands) Balance, beginning of period $ 16,972,743 $ 15,690,517 New production 788,477 1,556,257 Existing loans and leases: Payoffs (974,532 ) (728,628 ) Paydowns (936,002 ) (812,726 ) Disbursements 747,376 723,914 Sales (2) (130,624 ) (1,026,660 ) Charge-offs (12,153 ) (24,721 ) Transfers to loans held for sale - (481,100 ) Loans acquired through CUB acquisition - 2,075,890 Balance, end of period $ 16,455,285 $ 16,972,743 Weighted average rate on new production (3) 5.28 % 4.95 % (1) Includes direct financing leases but excludes equipment leased to others under operating leases.

The proceeds from the cash flow loan sale in the fourth quarter of 2017 allowed us to improve our funding mix by reducing our balances of non-core non-maturity deposits and time deposits.\nIn addition to deposit products, we also offer alternative non-depository cash investment options for select clients; these alternatives include investments managed by Square 1 Asset Management, Inc. (“S1AM”), our registered investment advisor subsidiary, and third-party sweep products. Total off-balance sheet client investment funds at March 31, 2018 were $2.1 billion, of which $1.6 billion was managed by S1AM.\nPROVISION AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\nA provision for credit losses of $4.0 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2018 compared to $6.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. The lower provision for the first quarter of 2018 was due mainly to lower period-end loan and lease balances and recoveries of $7.2 million. The allowance for credit losses to loans and leases held for investment coverage ratio increased to 1.01% at March 31, 2018 from 0.95% at December 31, 2017.\nThe following tables show roll forwards of the allowance for credit losses for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 Total Allowance for Credit Loans and Unfunded Losses Rollforward Leases Commitments Total (In thousands) Beginning balance $ 139,456 $ 28,635 $ 168,091 Charge-offs (12,153 ) - (12,153 ) Recoveries 7,198 - 7,198 Net charge-offs (4,955 ) - (4,955 ) Provision (226 ) 4,226 4,000 Ending balance $ 134,275 $ 32,861 $ 167,136\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 Non-PCI Allowance for Credit Loans and Unfunded Total PCI Losses Rollforward Leases Commitments Non-PCI Loans Total (In thousands) Beginning balance $ 152,770 $ 20,809 $ 173,579 $ 6,836 $ 180,415 Charge-offs (24,335 ) - (24,335 ) (386 ) (24,721 ) Recoveries 1,577 - 1,577 88 1,665 Net charge-offs (22,758 ) - (22,758 ) (298 ) (23,056 ) Provision 3,000 3,500 6,500 (94 ) 6,406 Fair value of acquired reserve for unfunded commitments - 4,326 4,326 - 4,326 Ending balance $ 133,012 $ 28,635 $ 161,647 $ 6,444 $ 168,091\nGross charge-offs for the first quarter of 2018 were $12.2 million and included $6.8 million for other commercial loans and $2.3 million for venture capital loans, while gross charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $24.7 million and included $20.1 million for venture capital loans. Recoveries in the first quarter of 2018 were $7.2 million and included $4.6 million for venture capital loans, the largest of which was a $4.0 million recovery on a venture capital loan partially charged off in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe annualized ratio of net charge-offs to average loans was 0.12% for the first quarter of 2018 and 0.52% for the fourth quarter of 2017.\nCREDIT QUALITY\nThe following table presents loan and lease credit quality metrics as of the dates indicated:\nMarch 31, December 31, Increase Credit Quality Metrics (1) 2018 2017 (Decrease) (Dollars in thousands) Nonaccrual loans and leases held for investment (2)(3) $ 103,725 $ 155,784 $ (52,059 ) Performing troubled debt restructured loans held for investment 60,173 56,838 3,335 Total impaired loans and leases $ 163,898 $ 212,622 $ (48,724 ) Classified loans and leases held for investment (2) $ 208,042 $ 278,405 $ (70,363 ) Allowance for credit losses $ 167,136 $ 161,647 $ 5,489 Provision for credit losses (for the quarter) $ 4,000 $ 6,500 $ (2,500 ) Net charge-offs (for the quarter) $ 4,955 $ 22,758 $ (17,803 ) Net charge-offs to average loans and leases (for the quarter) 0.12 % 0.52 % Allowance for credit losses to loans and leases held for investment 1.01 % 0.95 % Allowance for credit losses to nonaccrual loans and leases held for investment 161.1 % 103.8 % Nonaccrual loans and leases held for investment to loans and leases held for investment 0.63 % 0.92 % Nonperforming assets to loans and leases held for investment and foreclosed assets 0.64 % 0.93 % Classified loans and leases held for investment to loans and leases held for investment 1.26 % 1.64 % (1) Amounts and ratios related to March 31, 2018 are for total loans and leases.\nAmounts and ratios related to December 31, 2017 are for Non-PCI loans and leases.
