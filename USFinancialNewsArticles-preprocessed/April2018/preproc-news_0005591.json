    "text": "April 4, 2018 / 9:56 PM / Updated 4 hours ago Broadcom completes move to U.S. from Singapore Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Broadcom Inc ( AVGO.O ) said on Wednesday it had completed its move back to the United States from Singapore, weeks after President Donald Trump blocked its $117 billion (83.1 billion pounds) offer to buy Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ) on national security grounds. FILE PHOTO: A sign to the campus offices of chip maker Broadcom Ltd, who announced on Monday an unsolicited bid to buy peer Qualcomm Inc for $103 billion, is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., November 6, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File photo \nBroadcom, which was a U.S. company until it was bought in 2016 by Singapore’s Avago, had announced its plan to redomicile on Nov. 2, days before making its first offer for Qualcomm. \nThe company said it exchanged all shares of Broadcom Ltd to newly issued stock of Broadcom Inc on a one-for-one basis and that its stock would continue to trade under the same ticker. \nBroadcom’s existing co-headquarters in San Jose, California will become its sole headquarters, the company said. \nThe move to the United States could allow Broadcom to buy U.S. companies without coming under the scrutiny of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which has the power to stop deals that could harm national security. \nBroadcom’s shares were up 0.4 percent at $237.97 in after hours trading.
