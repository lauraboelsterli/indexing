    "text": "April 5 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson and Imerys SA must pay at least $37 million in a lawsuit claiming a man developed cancer due to his exposure to asbestos in talc-based products including Johnsonâ€™s Baby Powder, a New Jersey state court jury said on Thursday.\nThe verdict by jurors in New Brunswick, New Jersey, came in the second trial nationally to center on claims that J&J&rsquo;s talc products contained asbestos as the company separately fights thousands of cases claiming they can also cause ovarian cancer.
