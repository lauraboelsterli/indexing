    "text": "BERWICK, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- First Keystone Corporation (OTC Pink: FKYS), parent company of First Keystone Community Bank, announced today that Matthew P. Prosseda has resigned from the corporation and bank effective immediately. As a result, he is no longer the President and Chief Executive Officer or a director of the corporation and bank. “The Board of Directors would like to thank Matt for his leadership over the years. We wish him well in his future endeavors,” said Robert A. Bull, Chairman of the Board of Directors.\nThe Boards of Directors have appointed Elaine A. Woodland as interim President and Chief Executive Officer of the corporation and the bank until a permanent successor is named. Ms. Woodland has served as the Treasurer of the corporation and Chief Operating Officer of the bank since 2014. To assist Ms. Woodland in the operations of the corporation and bank, the Board of Directors has also formed a Management Committee comprised of Chairman of the Board, Robert A.

The committee will evaluate both internal and external candidates for the position. No timeline has been established to select a successor. Mr. Bull added, “While change is a necessary part of every growing company, we strongly believe that our senior management team and employees will lead First Keystone Corporation through this transition while continuing to execute our strategic plan and deliver the highest quality financial services to our customers.”\nAbout First Keystone Corporation\nFirst Keystone Corporation is the parent holding company for First Keystone Community Bank which provides innovative business and personal banking products that focus on “Yesterday’s Traditions.

These forward-looking statements can be identified by use of terminology such as “expect”, “plan”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “estimate”, and similar words that are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations, assumptions, estimates, and projections about the Corporation, the financial services industry, and the economy.
