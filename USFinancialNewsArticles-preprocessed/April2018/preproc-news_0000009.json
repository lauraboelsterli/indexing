Bush to the position of Head of Pharmacology/Toxicology and Russell Blacher to the position of Head of Manufacturing. These positions report to both Gene Williams, Executive Chairman and Elliot Goldstein, CEO of ProMIS Neurosciences. Dr. Bush and Mr. Blacher will support the design and execution of key late preclinical activities required for clinical trial initiation of lead therapeutic candidate, PMN310.\n\"We are pleased to welcome Russ Blacher and Ernie Bush to the ProMIS senior team. Both Ernie and Russ bring broad and rich experience and expertise in two critical areas of drug development: product safety/toxicology and manufacturing, respectively. Their appointments add significant value to the ProMIS team in preparing for the 2019 anticipated clinical trial initiation of PMN310, our lead program for Alzheimer's disease, and for planned regulatory submissions,\" said ProMIS President and CEO, Dr. Elliot Goldstein. \"We are delighted to have Russ and Ernie join the team as we advance our Alzheimer's program selectively targeting toxic oligomers of amyloid beta, known to be a root cause of Alzheimer's.\"\nAbout Ernest D.
