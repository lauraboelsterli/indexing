    "text": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian government and its allies are in consultation over U.S. threats of military action and have “options, an adviser to President Bashar al-Assad was Quote: d as saying in an interview with a Lebanese channel on Wednesday.\nSyrian President Bashar al-Assad meets with Syrian army soldiers in eastern Ghouta, Syria, March 18, 2018. SANA/Handout via REUTERS Bouthaina Shaaban told al-Mayadeen that the Syrian government and its main ally Russia had made preparations after Israel’s strike on Sunday against the T-4 airfield near Homs, the channel reported.\nThe West was waging a “psychological war” after the defeat of rebels in eastern Ghouta, she added, pointing to what she called contradictory statements between different branches of the U.S. government.\nEarlier on Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump said that American missiles “will be coming” to Syria as Western countries discussed military action over a suspected chemical weapons attack in eastern Ghouta on Sunday.\nHowever, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said the United States was still assessing evidence over who was behind the attack, which it has said bears the hallmark of Assad’s forces.\n“Consultations are ongoing between the allies and they will not let matters progress as Washington wants,” Shaaban told al-Mayadeen, describing the alliance as including Syria, Iran, Russia and the Lebanese group Hezbollah.\n“The rules of engagement have changed in favor of Damascus,” as its position in the war has grown stronger, she added.\nReporting By Angus McDowall; Editing by Angus MacSwan\n ",
