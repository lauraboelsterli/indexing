    "text": "SHANGHAI, China, April 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GDS Holdings Limited (“GDS Holdings”, “GDS” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ:GDS), a leading developer and operator of high-performance data centers in China, today announced that it has entered into an agreement to acquire a data center project in Guangzhou (“GZ3”), significantly expanding its footprint in this important Tier 1 market. GZ3 is a new purpose-built data center with potential for around 13,000 sqm of total IT area. It is being developed in three phases, the first of which, comprising approximately 6,600 sqm, has just entered service and is 100% committed by one of the Company’s largest cloud and internet customers. GZ3 is strategically located in the same vicinity as the existing GZ1 and GZ2 data centers, creating a data center cluster all anchored by major cloud and internet customers. The addition of GZ3, when fully developed, will double the Company’s total capacity in the Guangzhou market. The acquisition is expected to close in the next couple of months, subject to customary closing conditions.\n“We are pleased to announce the acquisition of GZ3 that will further strengthen our position in Guangzhou,” stated Mr. William Huang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GDS Holdings. “Not only does this acquisition meaningfully expand our presence in a key metro area, the value-enhancing synergies with the adjacent GZ1 and GZ2 facilities create a compelling proposition that allow us to uniquely serve the needs of our customers. GZ3 represents our fourth acquisition of a data center project in the past two years, and as part of our ongoing sourcing strategy, we will continue to pursue acquisitions of this type in tandem with our organic growth effort. In this booming China market, our demonstrated ability to provide continuous resource supply that underpins the expansion needs of our customers sets us apart from others and is a hallmark of our industry leadership.”\nAbout GDS Holdings Limited\nGDS Holdings Limited (Nasdaq:GDS) is a leading developer and operator of high-performance data centers in China.
