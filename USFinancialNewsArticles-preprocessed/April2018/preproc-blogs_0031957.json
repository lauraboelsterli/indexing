    "text": "Breaking News Mike Kemp | Contributor | Getty Images \nAmerican Express shares rose 2.5 percent after the company reported first-quarter earnings that beat estimates on Wednesday. \nThe results were its first since CEO Stephen Squeri took the helm of the company in February. \nAmEx has spent heavily on rewards to lure customers as it faces more competition from banks like J.P. Morgan Chase and Citigroup . \nHere are the results: \n—EPS: $1.86, compared to an estimate of $1.71 from Thomson Reuters \n—Revenue: $9.72 billion, compared to an estimate of $9.46 billion, according to Thomson Reuters \nIn January, former CEO Ken Chenault said AmEx will suspend its buyback program for the first half of the year to rebuild its capital because of an upfront charge triggered by the new tax law. \nThis story is developing.
