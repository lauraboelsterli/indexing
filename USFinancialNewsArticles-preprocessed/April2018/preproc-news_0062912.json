Property & Casualty Operations combined ratio for the first quarter was 93.1% compared with 97.2% in the first quarter of 2017. Net investment income, after tax, was $405 million for the first quarter of 2018.\nCNA Financial declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, payable May 30, 2018 to stockholders of record on May 14, 2018.\nResults for the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31\n($ millions, except per share data)\n2018\n2017\nNet income (b)\n$\n291\n$\n260\nCore income (b)(c)\n281\n235\nNet income per diluted share\n$\n1.07\n$\n0.96\nCore income per diluted share\n1.03\n0.87\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nBook value per share\n$\n42.10\n$\n45.15\nBook value per share excluding AOCI\n$\n43.57\n$\n45.02\n(a)\nAdjusted for the Small Business premium rate adjustment in the prior period.\n(b)\nResults in the quarter benefited from the reduction of the U.S. Federal tax rate from 35% to 21%.\n(c)\nManagement utilizes the core income (loss) financial measure to monitor the Company's operations.

This underwriting result was driven by an excellent underlying loss ratio of 60%, lower expense ratio and strong growth,\" said Dino E. Robusto, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of CNA Financial Corporation. \"In addition, our run-off long term care business again generated positive core income reflecting our disciplined approach towards managing this operation.\"\nProperty & Casualty Operations\nResults for the Three Months Ended\nMarch 31\n($ millions)\n2018\n2017\nNet written premiums\n$\n1,813\n$\n1,632\nNWP change (% year over year)\n11\n%\n(2)\n%\nNet investment income\n$\n285\n$\n343\nCore income\n327\n268\nLoss ratio excluding catastrophes and development\n60.0\n%\n62.2\n%\nEffect of catastrophe impacts\n2.1\n2.2\nEffect of development-related items\n(2.2)\n(2.4)\nLoss ratio\n59.9\n%\n62.0\n%\nExpense ratio\n32.8\n%\n34.9\n%\nCombined ratio\n93.1\n%\n97.2\n%\nCombined ratio excluding catastrophes and development\n93.2\n%\n97.4\n%\nThe combined ratio excluding catastrophes and development improved 4.2 points as compared with the prior year quarter driven by 2.2 points of improvement in the underlying loss ratio and a 2.1 point improvement in the expense ratio driven by higher net earned premiums.

The result of retroactive reinsurance accounting driven by additional cessions to the A&EP Loss Portfolio Transfer in the first quarter was a $32 million after-tax non-economic charge compared with $13 million in the prior year quarter.\nNet Investment Income\nPretax net investment income decreased $55 million for the first quarter of 2018 as compared with the prior year quarter. The decrease was driven by limited partnership investments, which returned 1.2% in 2018 as compared with 3.8% in the prior year period. However, despite the decline in limited partnership income, net investment income, after tax, increased $16 million for the first quarter of 2018 given stable fixed income returns and the lower tax rate.\nAbout the Company\nCNA is the eighth largest commercial insurer in the United States.

Commercial works with an independent agency distribution system and a network of brokers to market a broad range of property and casualty insurance products and services to small, middle-market and large businesses and organizations.

Life & Group primarily includes the results of the individual and group long term care businesses that are in run off. Corporate & Other primarily includes certain corporate expenses, including interest on corporate debt, and the results of certain property and casualty business in run-off, including CNA Re and asbestos and environmental pollution.\nFinancial Measures\nManagement utilizes the following metrics in their evaluation of the Property & Casualty Operations. These ratios are calculated using financial results prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).\nLoss ratio is the percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses to net earned premiums. Underlying loss ratio represents the loss ratio excluding catastrophes and development. Expense ratio is the percentage of insurance underwriting and acquisition expenses, including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, to net earned premiums. Dividend ratio is the ratio of policyholders' dividends incurred to net earned premiums. Combined ratio is the sum of the loss, expense and dividend ratios. Underlying combined ratio is the sum of the underlying loss, expense and dividend ratios. Renewal premium change represents the estimated change in average premium on policies that renew, including rate and exposure changes. Rate represents the average change in price on policies that renew excluding exposure change. Retention represents the percentage of premium dollars renewed in comparison to the expiring premium dollars from policies available to renew. New business represents premiums from policies written with new customers and additional policies written with existing customers.\nThe Company's investment portfolio is monitored by management through analysis of various factors including unrealized gains and losses on securities, portfolio duration and exposure to market and credit risk.\nReconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures\nThis press release also contains financial measures that are not in accordance with GAAP. Management utilizes these financial measures to monitor the Company's insurance operations and investment portfolio. The Company believes the presentation of these measures provides investors with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company's operating performance. Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures follow below.\nReconciliation of Net Income to Core Income\nCore income (loss) is calculated by excluding from net income (loss) the after-tax effects of i) net realized investment gains or losses, ii) income or loss from discontinued operations, iii) any cumulative effects of changes in accounting guidance and iv) deferred tax asset and liability remeasurement as a result of an enacted U.S. Federal tax rate change. The calculation of core income (loss) excludes net realized investment gains or losses because net realized investment gains or losses are generally driven by economic factors that are not necessarily consistent with key drivers of underwriting performance, and are therefore not considered an indication of trends in insurance operations. Management monitors core income (loss) for each business segment to assess segment performance. Presentation of consolidated core income (loss) is deemed to be a non-GAAP financial measure.\nResults for the Three Months\nEnded March 31\n($ millions)\n2018\n2017\nNet income\n$\n291\n$\n260\nLess: Net realized investment gains\n10\n25\nCore income\n$\n281\n$\n235\nReconciliation of Net Income per Diluted Share to Core Income per Diluted Share\nCore income (loss) per diluted share provides management and investors with a valuable measure of the Company's operating performance for the same reasons applicable to its underlying measure, core income (loss). Core income per diluted share is core income on a per diluted share basis.\nResults for the Three Months\nEnded March 31\n2018\n2017\nNet income per diluted share\n$\n1.07\n$\n0.96\nLess: Net realized investment gains\n0.04\n0.09\nCore income per diluted share\n$\n1.03\n$\n0.87\nReconciliation of Book Value per Share to Book Value per Share Excluding AOCI\nBook value per share excluding AOCI allows management and investors to analyze the amount of the Company's net worth primarily attributable to the Company's business operations. The Company believes this measurement is useful as it reduces the effect of items that can fluctuate significantly from period to period, primarily based on changes in interest rates.\nMarch 31,\n2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nBook value per share\n$\n42.10\n$\n45.15\nLess: Per share impact of AOCI\n(1.47)\n0.13\nBook value per share excluding AOCI\n$\n43.57\n$\n45.02\nCalculation of Return on Equity and Core Return on Equity\nCore return on equity provides management and investors with a measure of how effectively the Company is investing the portion of the Company's net worth that is primarily attributable to its business operations.\nResults for the Three Months\nEnded March 31\n($ millions)\n2018\n2017\nAnnualized net income\n$\n1,166\n$\n1,038\nAverage stockholders' equity including AOCI (a)\n11,835\n11,831\nReturn on equity\n9.8\n%\n8.8\n%\nAnnualized core income\n$\n1,122\n$\n941\nAverage stockholders' equity excluding AOCI (a)\n12,018\n11,963\nCore return on equity\n9.3\n%\n7.9\n%\n(a)\nAverage stockholders' equity is calculated using a simple average of the beginning and ending balances for the period.\nFor additional information, please refer herein and/or to CNA's most recent 10-K on file with the Securities , as well as the financial supplement, available at www.cna.com .\nForward-Looking Statement\nThis press release may include statements which relate to anticipated future events (forward-looking statements) rather than actual present conditions or historical events.
