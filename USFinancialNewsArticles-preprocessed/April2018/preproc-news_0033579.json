    "text": "April 17, 2018 / 6:49 AM / Updated 42 minutes ago Johnston Press sees signs of improvement in print ad market Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Johnston Press Plc ( JPR.L ), which publishes the Scotsman, said on Tuesday it was seeing early signs of improvement in the print advertising market. \nJohnston Press, which has over 200 titles, said advertisers were increasing spending in regional print in the wake of the fake news and social media trust concerns. \nThe newspaper industry has struggled in recent years as advertisers have migrated to online platforms, forcing several print publishers including Trinity Mirror ( TNI.L ) and Daily Mail and General Trust ( DMGOa.L ) to cut costs. \nThe newspaper publisher also cited “a somewhat stronger overall” advertising market and the company’s ability to precisely target audiences using big data as drivers for positive ad spending.
