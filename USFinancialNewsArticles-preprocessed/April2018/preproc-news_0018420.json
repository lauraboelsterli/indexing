(NYSE: AWK) announced today that it has commenced a registered underwritten offering of 2,320,000 shares of its common stock. Subject to certain conditions, all shares are expected to be offered in connection with the expected execution by the Company of forward sale agreements as discussed below.\nJ.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo Securities are acting as joint book-running managers for this offering. The underwriters may offer shares of American Water’s common stock in transactions on the New York Stock Exchange, in the over-the-counter market, through negotiated transactions or otherwise at either market prices, at prices related to market prices or at negotiated prices.\nIn connection with the offering, American Water expects to enter into forward sale agreements with affiliates of each of the underwriters, J.P. Morgan Securities and Wells Fargo Securities (the “forward purchasers”), pursuant to which American Water will agree to issue and sell to the forward purchasers (subject to American Water's right to elect cash settlement or net share settlement under the forward sale agreements) 2,320,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at the price per share at which the underwriters purchase the shares in the offering, subject to certain adjustments, upon physical settlement of the forward sale agreements. In connection with the forward sale agreements, the forward purchasers (or affiliates thereof) are expected to borrow from third-party lenders and sell to the underwriters 2,320,000 shares of the Company’s common stock.\nSettlement of the forward sale agreements is expected to occur on or prior to April 11, 2019.\nThe Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common stock sold by the forward purchasers to the underwriters.\nAs separately announced today, the Company has agreed to acquire all of the capital stock of Nicor Energy Services Company, doing business as Pivotal Home Solutions. The Company intends to elect full physical settlement of the forward sale agreements described above if it successfully completes this acquisition and to use any net proceeds that it receives upon settlement to fund a portion of the purchase price of this acquisition.\nThe offering is being made pursuant to American Water’s effective shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The preliminary prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus related to the offering will be available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov . Copies of the preliminary prospectus supplement and the accompanying base prospectus relating to this offering may be obtained from the joint-book running managers for the offering as follows:\nJ.P.
