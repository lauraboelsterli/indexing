    "text": "Apple is officially discontinuing its router models.\nApple’s existing routers—including the AirPort, AirPort Extreme, and Time Capsule—will only be available as supplies last, an Apple spokesperson told Engadget .\nIt won’t come as a surprise to many, especially as Apple’s hardware division tasked with developing its routers disbanded way back in 2016, according to Bloomberg. Apple also hasn’t released an updated router model in a number of years now.\nThere are also many other faster routers available, including mesh routers that can provide a larger coverage area and many ISPs now provide them as well. Apple even sells some third-party mesh router options in its stores, The Verge noted .\nHowever, it may not be the end of Apple’s space in the router world entirely. The spokesperson added that could return to making routers “if it can make a meaningful contribution to the space.” Apple first debuted its routers all the way back in 1999, when Wi-Fi was far less common. The line was introduced by Steve Jobs at the time.",
