Damaged caused by fire from a burning illegal oil well is seen in Ranto Peureulak, Aceh Province, Indonesia April 25, 2018 in this photo taken by Antara Foto. Antara Foto/Rahmad/ via REUTERS\nFirefighters struggled all day to put out the blaze in the northwestern province of Aceh and were still working as darkness fell.\nDozens of people suffering from burns were taken to hospital in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh, several hours away from where the accident happened.\n“There was panic among the public because the fire is in a residential area,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mitigation agency.

Antara Foto/Rahmad/via REUTERS\nThe fire broke out early on Wednesday after a well of depth 250 metres (820 ft) overflowed and residents gathered to collect the oil, the agency said.\nEarlier, Nugroho posted pictures on social media that showed flames towering over houses and trees as firefighters hosed down the area while villagers looked on.

Incidents like these are likely to happen because they don’t pay attention to elements like safety.”\nPertamina, which has operations in the area, was providing equipment to help fight the fire. At least eight fire trucks had been deployed to try to douse the blaze.\nThe head of police in the area said the fire might have been sparked by a careless smoker.\n“We suspect there was someone smoking,” said police official Wahyu Kuncoro.
