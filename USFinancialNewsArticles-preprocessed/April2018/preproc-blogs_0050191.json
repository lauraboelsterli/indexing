While becoming rich is one thing, staying rich is another.\nNearly 80 percent of retired players go broke in their first two years out of the league, according to Sports Illustrated .\nOnce a first-round draft pick, former NFL player Patrick Kerney beat those odds. The former Pro Bowl defensive end socked away the bulk of his income after 11 years with the Atlanta Falcons and the Seattle Seahawks.\nshow chapters Biggest and most exciting draft in history, says NFL agent 1:11 PM ET Thu, 26 April 2018 | 03:27 After Kerney retired, he earned an MBA from Columbia University and went on to give financial advice to other NFL players. He is now the director of business development at NFC Investments and principal at Kerney Insurance.\nTo newly minted pros, Kerney advocates for a very conservative mindset at the outset. \"Keep a year's worth of spending in cash in a high-yield savings account and invest the rest,\" he said.\n\"They need to act like this contract is the only contract they'll ever have in the NFL and treat future contracts like gravy.\"\nWillie Thomas, a former Pro Bowl linebacker who also became a financial pro, dedicates himself to working primarily with athletes on managing their wealth as a Merrill Lynch advisor based in San Francisco.\nThomas admits to facing financial trouble early on in his football career in Seattle after buying a house for his mom that stretched his funds to the breaking point.\nNow, Thomas recommends that young players find a trustworthy advisor and set up a financial plan with a monthly budget and withdrawal rate of 4 percent or less. That will help players establish parameters around spending and manage requests for money from friends and family, he said.\nTo protect yourself and your retirement, it's important that you understand the type of advice you're getting when you meet with a financial advisor.
