    "text": "A Dead Spider Was in This Woman's McDonald's Sandwich and She 'Didn't Even Get an Apology' A McChicken sandwich sits with typical Dollar Menu items at a McDonald's restaurant. Scott Olson—Getty Images By Jamie Ducharme 10:15 AM EDT \nA U.K. woman got more than poultry when she bit into her McDonald’s McChicken sandwich on Monday. \nClassical singer Ciara Harvie was dining at a McDonald’s in Edinburgh, Scotland, when she discovered a dead spider hiding among the lettuce leaves topping her chicken sandwich, the Mirror reports . \nIn a Facebook post, which was eventually deleted after being shared more than 2,000 times, the 20-year-old musician wrote that she “took it back and didn’t even get an apology,” adding that, “I don’t think I’ll be going back anytime soon.” The Mirror captured a screenshot of the post before it was deleted.

We have since spoken again with the customer to apologise once more and offer another replacement meal, which was declined,” a McDonald’s representative told the Mirror in a statement. \n“I understand that things like this happen, and probably not very often, but I think the way they handled it was the most disappointing thing,” Harvie told the paper. \nThis isn’t the first time a McDonald’s customer got more than they bargained for: Last summer, a Michigan woman claimed she found a worm in her Filet-O-Fish.
