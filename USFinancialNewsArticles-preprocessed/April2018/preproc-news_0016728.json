    "text": "MARLBOROUGH, Mass., April 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- RXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation (NASDAQ: RXII), a biotechnology company developing immuno-oncology therapeutics based on its proprietary self-delivering RNAi (sd-rxRNA ® ) therapeutic platform, announced today that it has entered into definitive agreements with several institutional and accredited investors for the purchase of 1,510,604 shares of its common stock, at a purchase price per share of $3.24375, for gross proceeds of approximately $4.9 million, in a registered direct offering priced at-the-market. Additionally, RXi has also agreed to issue to the investors unregistered warrants to purchase up to 1,132,953 shares of common stock. The closing of the offering is expected to take place on or about April 11, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\nH.C. Wainwright & Co. is acting as the exclusive placement agent for the offering.\nThe warrants have an exercise price of $3.15 per share of common stock, shall be exercisable immediately and will expire on the earlier of five and one-half years from the issuance date and 5 years from the date a registration statement registering the shares of common stock underlying the warrants becomes effective.\nNet proceeds, after deducting the placement agent's fee and other estimated offering expenses payable by RXi, are expected to be approximately $4.1 million. RXi intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including but, not limited to, funding its preclinical and clinical development, other research and development activities and for general and administrative expenses.\nThe shares of common stock (but not the warrants or the shares of common stock underlying the warrants) are being offered by the Company pursuant to a \"shelf\" registration statement on Form S-3 that was filed and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on April 6, 2018 and the base prospectus contained therein (File No. 333-224031). The offering of the shares of common stock will be made only by means of a prospectus supplement that form a part of the registration statement.\nA prospectus supplement and accompanying base prospectus relating to the shares of common stock being offered will be filed with the SEC. Copies of the final prospectus supplement and accompanying base prospectus may be obtained, when available, on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov or by contacting H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC at 430 Park Avenue, 3rd Floor, New York, NY 10022, by phone at 646-975-6996 or e-mail at placements@hcwco.com .\nThe warrants described above were offered in a private placement under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Act\"), and Regulation D promulgated thereunder and, along with the shares of common stock underlying the warrants, have not been registered under the Act, or applicable state securities laws. Accordingly, the warrants and underlying shares of common stock may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Act and such applicable state securities laws.\nThis press release shall not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.\nAbout RXi Pharmaceuticals\nRXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation (NASDAQ: RXII) a biotechnology company developing immuno-oncology therapeutics based on its self-delivering RNAi (sd-rxRNA ® ) therapeutic platform. Building on the pioneering discovery of RNAi, scientists at RXi have harnessed the naturally occurring RNAi process which can be used to \"silence\" or down-regulate the expression of a specific gene that may be overexpressed in a disease condition. RXi developed a robust RNAi therapeutic platform, including sd-rxRNA compounds, that has the potential to highly selectively block the expression of any target in the genome, thus providing applicability to many therapeutic areas. RXi's extensive patent portfolio provides for multiple product and business development opportunities across a broad spectrum of therapeutic areas, and we actively pursue research collaborations, partnering and out-licensing opportunities with academia and pharmaceutical companies.
