    "text": "(Recasts throughout, updates prices to close)\nTORONTO, April 11 (Reuters) - Canada’s benchmark stock index was little changed on Wednesday as higher commodity prices amid geopolitical concerns boosted the shares of energy and materials companies, offsetting a decline in the heavily-weighted financials sector.\n* The Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX composite index closed down 4.24 points, or 0.03 percent, at 15,257.90.\n* Stocks on Wall Street were pressured by possible U.S. military action against Syria and minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee that sparked worries about a more hawkish view on interest-rate increases.\n* The TSX’s financials group, which accounts for more than one-third of the weight of the index, fell 0.8 percent.\n* Six of the index’s 10 main industry groups ended lower.\n* The energy group climbed 1.8 percent, while the materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, added 0.8 percent.\n* U.S. crude oil futures settled 2 percent higher at $66.82 a barrel after Saudi Arabia said it intercepted missiles over Riyadh. Conflict in the region triggers concern about crude flows across the wider Middle East.\n* Gold futures rose 0.7 percent to $1,351.7 an ounce as investors bought safe-haven assets.\n* The TSX posted five new 52-week highs and seven new lows.\n* The largest percentage gainer on the TSX was Torex Gold Resources Inc, which rose 20.1 percent, while the largest decliner was Prometic Life Sciences, down 7.1 percent.
