    "text": "April 8, 2018 / 7:55 PM / Updated 19 minutes ago Tennis-Goerges and Bertens advance to Charleston final Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nApril 8 (Reuters) - Germany’s Julia Goerges and Dutch 12th seed Kiki Bertens advanced to the final of the rain-delayed Volvo Car Open with semi-final victories on Sunday. \nThey will meet for the title later on Sunday in Charleston, South Carolina. \nThe fifth-seeded Goerges defeated eighth seed Anastasija Sevastova, of Latvia, 7-6(5) 6-3 after the match had been suspended on Saturday with the score 4-4 in the first set. \nBertens outlasted American Madison Keys 6-4 6-7(2) 7-6(5) in the other, much tighter semi-final. \nWorld number 13 Goerges, who broke into the top 10 for the first time earlier in the year, will be seeking her second title of 2018 after winning in Auckland in January. \nWhen her match resumed, the German took the first set in a tiebreak before going on to reach her seventh final in the past 12 months. \nGoerges hit 45 winners, almost twice as many as Sevastova’s 23 but the Latvian still had her chances, only managing to convert one of 14 break points. \nBertens, going for her first win this year, broke Keys eight times and saved a match point in their morning semi-final. \nKeys led 5-4 in the third set before the Dutch player rallied to force the deciding tiebreak, which she won when Keys netted a backhand.
