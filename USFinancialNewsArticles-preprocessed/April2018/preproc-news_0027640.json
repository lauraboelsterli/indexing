    "text": " 25 a.m. ET Share \nThe company has accused a top official of unspecified involvement in the incident Getty Images Corinne Abrams Debiprasad Nayak \nIndian cryptocurrency exchange Coinsecure said some $3 million in bitcoin has gone missing from a digital wallet that held its users’ funds, and accused a top company official of involvement in the disappearance. \nCoinsecure said its system hadn’t been hacked, but that the losses had occurred as the company was extracting bitcoin BTCUSD, +5.96% to distribute to its customers. \n“We regret to inform you that our bitcoin funds have been exposed and seem to have been siphoned out to an address that is outside our control,” read a statement posted on Coinsecure’s official website . \nThe incident comes during a rocky period for bitcoin, amid new, widespread cryptocurrency regulations that have seen it tumble after reaching record highs in December. \nAnd: Is bitcoin’s biggest gain in 2 months a short squeeze or a change in sentiment? \nIn a letter posted on the company’s site and addressed to police in New Delhi, Coinsecure’s chief executive Mohit Kalra accused chief scientific officer Amitabh Saxena of having a “role to play” in the incident—without giving further details. Kalra and Saxena were the only holders of private keys to the company’s wallet, the letter said.",
