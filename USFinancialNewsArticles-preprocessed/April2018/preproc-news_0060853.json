    "text": "18 COMMENTS Bicycle helmets have been getting all sorts of high-tech add-ons, from heart-rate monitors to navigation systems and integrated turn signals. But a decidedly low-tech problem persists: Cyclists hate wearing helmets—not to mention carrying them around. “These are real issues that stop people from wearing helmets,” said Tim Blumenthal, president of People for Bikes, a Boulder, Colo.-based advocacy group.\nAs more cities start bike-share programs and add bicycle lanes, there are more cyclists on the roads without helmets—and more fatalities . Cyclist deaths in traffic accidents in 2016 were the most in 25 years, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. An earlier New York City review of 10 years of traffic accidents showed that 97% of cyclist deaths from 1996 to 2005 came when riders weren’t wearing helmets.\nNewsletter Sign-up To respond, startup manufacturers are building a growing niche: Helmets that can fold, collapse or roll up when they’re not being worn. Just a few such helmets have passed U.S. safety standards. Overade’s Plixi model, for instance, folds into a tortoise-like shape that reduces its volume by two-thirds. Closca’s Fuga collapses within its brim into a thick circle that’s about half its wearable size. Both sell for prices similar to high-end non-folding helmets.\nNext comes Brooklyn-based startup Park & Diamond, with a design that looks like a soft baseball cap and that the inventors—two Virginia Tech engineering students—say can be rolled up into the size of a reusable water bottle and tucked into a bicycle’s bottle holder. The prototype has a breathable spandex skin stretched over a flexible composite material; the inventors have filed for a patent. They have not set a price yet and still need to be certified as passing U.S. standards, but say they plan to start selling it by the end of this summer.\nMore types of foldable helmets have passed the easier European standard, said Randy Swart, executive director of the Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute in Arlington, Va. He says it’s difficult for helmets to get more portable because the lining needs to retain a certain bulk to withstand impacts, normally an inch thick. “Nobody has a miracle material yet that will work in a quarter-inch version,” he said.",
