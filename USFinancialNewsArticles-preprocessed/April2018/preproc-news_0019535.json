    "text": "LOS ANGELES, April 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nova LifeStyle, Inc. (NASDAQ:NVFY), a leading U.S.-based, innovative designer and distributor of modern LifeStyle home products, today issued financial guidance for Fiscal Year 2018.\nFull Year Outlook for 2018:\nRevenues Guidance\nFor fiscal year 2018, Nova LifeStyle currently expects total revenue to be at least $110 million, based on organic growth of existing operations. In addition, the Company may elect to pursue potential strategic M&A opportunities which could provide additional revenue contribution. E-commerce sales from the Company’s subsidiary, Diamond Sofa ( https://www.diamondsofa.com/ ), are expected to achieve record performance, with significant growth deriving from marketing to large accounts such as Amazon.com and other established digital platforms.\nNova LifeStyle has sufficient capital to fund its projected growth and therefore currently has no plan to dilute current shareholders through equity offerings. Further, the Company does not expect its business to be materially impacted in any way by the trade policy differences between the U.S. and China.\n2018 Net Income, Earnings Per Share (EPS) Guidance\nFor fiscal year 2018, Nova LifeStyle currently expects net income to be approximately $9.5 million, or EPS of $0.34 on a fully diluted basis, constituting a significant increase from 2017 net income of $3.8 million and diluted EPS of $0.14.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Performance\nThe Company anticipates reporting significant sales and net income growth for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nApproved $5 Million Stock Buyback to Initiate in Q2/18\nThe Company expects to engage in a stock buyback in the open market from time to time under an approved $5 million share buyback program approved by our Board in December, 2017. Subject to certain regulatory blackout periods, the Company intends to execute the buyback program beginning in the current second quarter.\nInvestor Awareness, Non-deal Roadshows\nIn 2018, the Company intends to actively engage with shareholders and the investment community in general to further enhance shareholder value, share trading depth and liquidity. The Company plans to meet with institutional investors through non-deal roadshows in 2018.\nMANAGEMENT COMMENT\nTawny Lam, CEO of Nova LifeStyle, commented: “We currently anticipate 2018 to be a year of record sales and earnings growth. Based on our analysis of market trends and customer feedback, Nova LifeStyle expects to launch several new product lines in 2018 targeting the millennial communities as well as deepening channels in the hospitality industry. We expect E-commerce sales to remain strong and are looking for our own “Diamond Sofa” brand to attract large sales volumes.”\n“With a strong balance sheet and favorable market conditions, Nova LifeStyle looks forward to executing on its plans for 2018 and hopefully exceeding our own financial guidance,” Ms. Lam concluded.\nAbout Nova LifeStyle\nNova LifeStyle, Inc., a NASDAQ Global Market listed company headquartered in California and founded nearly 30 years ago, is a fast growing, innovative designer and distributor of modern LifeStyle residential and commercial furniture products: sofas, dining rooms, cabinets, office furniture and related components, bedrooms, and various accessories in matching collections.
