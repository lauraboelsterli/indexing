That is supporting the euro but also sterling and Asian currencies,” said Alvin Tan, FX Strategist at Societe Generale.”\nWhile the dollar was flat against a basket of major currencies, it held near a two-week low tested earlier in the Asian session.\nSeveral Asian currencies, including the Korean Won, rose on hopes that U.S.-China trade conflict would calm down.\nElsewhere, the Swiss franc fell to its lowest versus the euro since the Swiss National Bank scrapped its currency peg in January 2015. Sterling reached a new post-Brexit referendum high .\nThe franc, which analysts expect to fall further as the Swiss central bank sticks to its loose monetary policy even as rivals tighten, slipped 0.2 percent on the day to 1.1905 .\nTALKING DOWN THE DOLLAR? Against the yen, the dollar fell to 107.06 yen, off the seven-week high of 107.78 yen it touched on Friday, before a meeting between Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Tuesday and Wednesday.\nTokyo is eager to avoid being pushed into talks on a two-way free-trade agreement aimed not only at market access but at monetary and currency policies.\nTraders suspect Washington will put pressure on Japan after the U.S. Treasury’s semi-annual currency report on Friday kept Japan on a monitoring list for possible manipulation .\nTrump accused Russia and China on Monday of devaluing their currencies, even though the yuan has been strengthening and U.S. sanctions have been blamed for rouble’s decline.\n“How grounded the comment is in fact is much less important than the fact that he said it. It also suggests that President Trump could attempt to ‘talk down the dollar’ to shrink the US import bill. This will undoubtedly reinforce the appetite for investors to hedge their dollar exposures given the unpredictability and uncertainty over dollar policy going forward,” MUFG analysts said in a note.\nChina’s economy grew 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2018 from a year earlier, data showed on Tuesday, above expectations and unchanged from the previous quarter .\nAdditional reporting by Hideyuki Sano in TOKYO Editing by Larry King\n ",
