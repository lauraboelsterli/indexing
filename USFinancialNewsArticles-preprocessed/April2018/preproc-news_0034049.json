    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Former United States Securities and Exchange Commission attorney Willie Briscoe , founder of The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC , announces that a federal class action lawsuit has been filed against Henry Schein, Inc. (“Henry Schein” or “Company”) (NasdaqGS: HSIC) and several officers and directors for acts taken during the period of March 7, 2013 and February 12, 2018 (the “Class Period”).\nBased upon the allegations in the class action, the firm is investigating additional legal claims against the officers and Board of Directors of Henry Schein. If you are an affected Henry Schein shareholder and want to learn more about the lawsuit or join the action, contact Willie Briscoe at The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC via email at shareholders@thebriscoelawfirm.com or call toll free at (888) 809-2750. There is no cost or fee to you.\nAccording to the complaint, the defendants are alleged to have violated certain provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Specifically, the complaint alleges, among other things, that defendants issued false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose the following: (1) Henry Schein was engaging in unethical, anti-competitive behavior through agreements with Benco Dental Supply Company and Patterson Companies, Inc., in violation of United States antitrust laws; (2) Henry Schein engaged in such behavior, in part, to help maintain profitability in a consolidating health care industry; (3) these violations of U.S. antitrust laws would result in heightened scrutiny by the federal government and a lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission; (4) Henry Schein failed to maintain adequate internal controls; and (5) as a result, defendants' statements about Henry Schein’s business, operations and prospects were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. When this news was revealed to the market, the Company’s stock dropped significantly.\nThe Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC is a full service business litigation, commercial transaction, and public advocacy firm with more than 20 years of experience in complex litigation and transactional matters.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180418005912/en/\nThe Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC\nWillie Briscoe, 888-809-2750\nshareholders@thebriscoelawfirm.com\nSource: The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC",
