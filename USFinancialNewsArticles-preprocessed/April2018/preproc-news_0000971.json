    "text": "HOLMDEL, N.J., April 3, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- WorkWave® ( www.WorkWave.com ), a leading provider of cloud-based software solutions for the field service and \"last mile\" delivery industries, today announced that its Chief Marketing Officer, Ken Wincko, has been named one of 18 B2B Marketers to Follow in 2018 by the B2B Marketing Exchange. This year's list recognizes marketing professionals who have become experts in areas such as account-based marketing, lead nurturing and demand generation.\n\"It is an honor to be recognized as one of this year's top B2B marketers to follow by the B2B Marketing Exchange, alongside other peer marketing leaders,\" said Wincko. \"Our WorkWave marketing team is focused on progressive marketing techniques such as predictive analytics, machine learning, personalization and interactive content to create exceptional customer experiences and maximize revenue growth.\"\nAs a member of WorkWave's senior leadership team, Wincko is responsible for managing the global corporate marketing strategy for the company. He has over 20 years of marketing and business experience in bringing cutting-edge marketing programs and solutions to market for both B2B and B2C organizations. He has led his teams to extraordinary success in a series of high level roles at top-tier companies including Cision/PR Newswire, Dun & Bradstreet, ADP, Citigroup and IBM. In 2016, his team at PR Newswire was named Enterprise Marketing Team of the Year by Marketo, and also won Best Integrated Marketing Program in the Marcomm Awards in 2015.\n\"Our goal with highlighting 18 marketers to follow in 2018 was to showcase a mix of different roles and industries that are helping to innovate and break new ground,\" said Andrew Gaffney, Content Director for B2B Marketing Exchange and Demand Gen Report. \"Ken Wincko clearly meets that criteria. The perspective he added to the CMO Panel during this year's B2B Marketing Exchange event helped to identify new technologies, as well as processes and skills required to succeed and grow in today's climate. Knowing Ken's track record, I'm confident he is going to help drive growth at WorkWave and will likely provide some great ideas for other marketers to check out through his partnerships, strategies and technology implementations.\"\nWincko is a frequent speaker at major industry conferences such as the B2B Marketing Exchange, Dreamforce, Marketo Summit and Oracle OpenWorld, and has been covered in a wide variety of publications such as CMO.com , the Demand Gen Report, Alister & Paine, and more.
