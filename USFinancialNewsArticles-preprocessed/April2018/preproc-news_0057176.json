    "text": "MGM COTAI Opened in February\nNet Revenue Grew 26% Year on Year\nHONG KONG, MGM China Holdings Limited (\"MGM China\" or the \"Company\"; SEHK Stock Code: 2282) today announced the selected unaudited financial data of the Company and its subsidiaries (the \"Group\") for the three months ended March 31, 2018.\nIn the first quarter, MGM China recorded total revenue of HK$4.7 billion, an increase of 26% from the same quarter last year. While the gross gaming revenue (GGR) of Macau gaming market grew approximately 21% year on year to HK$74 billion in the first quarter this year, MGM China saw its casino win up by approximately 24%. Adjusted EBITDA was up by 4% from a year ago to approximately HK$1.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 27.4%. For the quarter, the Group recorded main floor table games win of HK$2.6 billion, an increase of approximately 20% from a year ago.

MGM China's VIP table win was up approximately 26% compared to an estimated growth of 22% for VIP GGR in Macau. On February 13, we opened the doors of MGM COTAI showcasing MGM's one-of-a-kind entertainment experiences. MGM COTAI is a HK$27 billion integrated resort that leverages innovation and artistry, allowing our guests to create extraordinary moments during their stay and supporting the development of Macau as a global tourism destination. With the opening of second integrated resort in Macau, we are excited to see a substantial growth of our customer database. For the Quarter, daily new signups exceeded 1,000 since MGM COTAI opened. The new hotel also helped us in reactivating significant amount of lapsed customers. Meanwhile, we are experiencing robust business and traffic at MGM MACAU for the Quarter. The property has experienced minimal cannibalization after MGM COTAI opened. MGM MACAU Property EBITDA was HK$1.2 billion (17Q1: HK$1.2 billion) despite lower hold across gaming segments.
