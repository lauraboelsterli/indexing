    "text": "WILMINGTON, Del., April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Art Bacci will lead the wealth business as the new Chief Wealth Officer of WSFS Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:WSFS) and its primary subsidiary, WSFS Bank. WSFS Wealth Management provides a broad array of fiduciary, investment management, and credit and deposit products to clients through six business units. Mr. Bacci will also serve as an Executive Vice President and will join WSFS’ executive leadership team. He succeeds Paul Geraghty who retired earlier this month after seven years with the Company.\nArthur J. Bacci will lead the wealth business as the new Chief Wealth Officer of WSFS Financial Corporation and its primary subsidiary, WSFS Bank.\nMr. Bacci joins WSFS from Principal Financial Group where he successfully led multiple segments over 15 years. Most recently, he was head of Principal’s Hong Kong business where he spearheaded the acquisition and integration of a pension fund company that doubled Principal’s market share. Previously, Mr. Bacci was President and CEO of Principal Bank, assuming the role in 2007 and successfully guided the bank through the Great Recession. Mr. Bacci first served as CFO of Delaware-based Principal Trust Company and in 2005 became its President and CEO.\n“We are excited to welcome Art to the WSFS family,” said WSFS’ Rodger Levenson, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. “Paul Geraghty helped us build a wealth business that positioned WSFS for future sustained growth and diversified fee income. As we sought to find our next Chief Wealth Officer, we wanted a leader who has the experience and vision to build on WSFS Wealth Management’s successes and who will be a key team member as we work to achieve performance goals. Art is that leader.”\n“I look forward to contributing to WSFS’ 186-year history of providing exceptional customer and financial services in the Delaware Valley,” said Mr. Bacci. “I believe in the WSFS mission, We Stand For Service , and throughout my career have always aspired to work for organizations of honesty and integrity. WSFS fits the bill. My wife and I are also thrilled to move back to the Delaware Valley. Our children grew up here, and we look forward to re-engaging with the community.”\nWSFS Wealth Management has grown to offer personalized solutions to help clients reach their financial objectives.
