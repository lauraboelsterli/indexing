    "text": "\nHowever, there have been some reports in Korean media that Seoul may now be considering joining up to the TPP , and could even have considered doing so along with the U.S. \nThe White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. \nThe post comes a few days after Trump asked advisors to consider the possibility of re-entering the TPP . The president has previously said that Washington would only join if the landmark pact was \"substantially better\" than the version offered to former President Barack Obama. \nOfficially known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), the landmark agreement was signed last month and will cut tariffs between 11 member countries, which include Australia, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia and Mexico. It is currently awaiting ratification from six of the nations. show chapters 10:42 AM ET Fri, 13 April 2018 | 01:38 \nAbe has long vocalized a desire for Washington to rejoin the landmark deal following Trump's decision to withdraw in January 2017. But it's unclear whether the remaining TPP members will be open to re-negotiating a deal that was thrown into disarray following the U.S. exit. \nJapanese lawmakers are currently deliberating the TPP in parliament. \nIn a press briefing on Tuesday, White House Chief Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow said \"there are discussions and considerations\" between American and Japanese trade officials on the TPP. \nWhen asked whether Washington would look into negotiating a different pact, Kudlow said that, if the country chose to \"improve\" the deal, \"we will have to be convinced that it's worth our while.\" \n\"I don't think the president is yet convinced of that, to be honest,\" he added.
