    "text": "Stocks fell Wednesday morning on rising concerns over a potential trade war between the U.S. and China. \nChina on Wednesday announced new tariffs on 106 U.S. products, including soybeans, cars, aerospace and defense. \nAs a result, automakers such as Ford and General Motors shares fell sharply near the market open, but rallied to up slightly later in the morning. Telsa's stock dropped as much as 5 percent before paring its loss and rising to up 3 percent. China is a key market for the electric car maker. Getty Images A Boeing 787 Dreamliner operated by United Airlines takes off from Los Angeles International Airport. \nAerospace company Boeing was down 2.4 percent. The company announced a $37 billion order for its planes from China last year. \nU.S. machine manufacturers that serve the agricultural and construction industries also fell. Deere was down more than 4 percent and Caterpillar fell 1.3 percent.China's move came after the Trump administration on Tuesday named a list of Chinese imports it plans to target for tariffs. \nSectors covered by President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs include products used for robotics, information technology, communication technology and aerospace.",
