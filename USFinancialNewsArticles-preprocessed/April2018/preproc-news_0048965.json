FILE PHOTO: Soccer Football - Europa League Round of 16 Second Leg - Arsenal vs AC Milan - Emirates Stadium, London, Britain - March 15, 2018 AC Milan coach Gennaro Gattuso reacts REUTERS/David Klein/File Photo \n“Such a performance is unacceptable,” he said after Saturday night’s s 1-0 reverse at San Siro. “I already had a strange feeling in the past days. We are a team who lack a soul: I am the first man responsible. We must change attitude.” \n“This was not just a loss but will go down in AC Milan’s history,” added the famously fiery former midfielder. “This is a burning defeat because AC Milan is an historic and prestigious club. Someone has to be responsible for this, and this is me.” \n“We have to apologise to the fans for this embarrassment. At the first sign of difficulties, the team lose their way.” \nBig-spending Milan are sixth in Serie A with 54 points but will be knocked out of the Europa League spots if Atalanta beat Torino later on Sunday.
