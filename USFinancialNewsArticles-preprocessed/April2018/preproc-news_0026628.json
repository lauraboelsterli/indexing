REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin/File Photo \n“A pre-designed scenario is being implemented,” Russian Ambassador Anatoly Antonov said on Twitter. “Again, we are being threatened. We warned that such actions will not be left without consequences.” \n“Insulting the President of Russia is unacceptable and inadmissible,” he added. “The U.S. - the possessor of the biggest arsenal of chemical weapons - has no moral right to blame other countries.” Reporting by Tim Ahmann and Eric Beech; Editing by Eric Walsh",
