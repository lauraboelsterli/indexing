REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo \nThe video streaming pioneer, which raised $1.6 billion in debt last October, has been spending aggressively on original content to drive subscriber growth around the world. \nNetflix crushed Wall Street’s estimates for subscriber additions earlier this month, driven by hit original shows “Altered Carbon” and “Jessica Jones”, and said it looks to spend nearly $8 billion on content in 2018. \nThe company also reported long-term debt of $6.5 billion at the end of first quarter and said it expects free cash flow to be negative in the second half of 2018. \nNetflix had around $2.6 billion in cash, according to the company’s latest quarterly report. \nThe company said on Monday it intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, which may include content acquisitions, production. \nNetflix shares were up 1 percent in premarket trading.
