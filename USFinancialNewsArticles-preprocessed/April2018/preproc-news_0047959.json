    "text": "Quarterly revenue of $9 . 4 million increased 10% over the prior year third quarter\nUnused Medication solutions business increased 111%; represents over 20% of total Company billings\nRoute-based business increased 15%\nUnused medication management and route-based services represented over 40% of the Company’s March 2018 quarter customer billing\nMedSafe collection receptacles installed base of 2,173 units versus 876 a year ago\nRetail market billings increased 104%\nHOUSTON, April 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sharps Compliance Corp. (NASDAQ:SMED) (“Sharps” or the “Company”), a leading full-service national provider of comprehensive waste management solutions including medical, pharmaceutical and hazardous, today reported financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2018, which ended March 31, 2018.\nRevenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 increased 10% to $9.4 million, as compared to revenue of $8.6 million in the same prior year quarter, with gross margin of 24%, a decline from gross margin of 27% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin was adversely impacted in the third quarter by unplanned incremental costs associated with the Company’s treatment facility and route based operations in the Northeast related to severe winter storms. The gross margin also reflects a lower margin on unused medication collection receptacles related to the launch of a major new program. The Company reported an operating loss of $0.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to an operating loss of $0.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Sharps recorded a net loss of $0.8 million or ($0.05) per basic and diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to a net loss of $0.7 million or ($0.04) per basic and diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nDavid P. Tusa, President and Chief Executive Officer of Sharps, stated, “The revenue and billings growth in the March quarter was driven by stronger sales of our unused medication treatment solutions including the MedSafe and growth in our route-based medical waste pick-up business. The proper management of unused medications, including controlled substances, remains a national concern and represents what we believe to be an estimated $1 billion market opportunity with Sharps Compliance as the leader in penetrating this market. Billings contribution related to unused medications doubled in the quarter from 10% to 20% of total billings.\n“We saw continued momentum in our route-based business which grew by 15% and contributed 21% of billings in the third quarter. We believe our ability to provide customers with cost-efficient solutions, be it pick-up, mailback or a combination thereof, reasonable contract terms, online training and tracking tools plus great customer service and superior regulatory support, positions us very well to capture additional market share of the small to medium quantity medical waste management business across the country.”\nStrategic Transformation\nTusa added, “I believe it’s important to highlight the fact that over 40% of our customer billings for the March quarter were generated by solution offerings launched over the past two years. This strategic move was a result of a number of factors including recognizing that we could not grow a company based primarily on a seasonal, unpredictable and uncontrollable flu season mailback business. We also recognized that we needed complementary solutions that could be sold into our existing and prospective customer base to accelerate our penetration rate in the medical waste management business. Additionally, we saw the opportunity to expand our offerings to include unused medication management at a time when the country is looking for solutions to facilitate proper disposal of unused medications including controlled substances and to help the country address the opioid crisis.\"\nThird Quarter Review\nProfessional market billings increased 7% to $3.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $3.0 million in the prior year period. This increase represents organic growth related to the Company’s focus on securing customers from the small to medium quantity generator sector, made up of physicians, clinics, dentists, surgery centers, veterinarians and other healthcare professionals, who typically use a combination of the cost-effective and convenient Sharps Recovery System™ and the Company’s route-based pick-up services. The Company’s inside and online sales channel, which primarily targets the Professional and Government markets, realized a 24% increase in billings to $1.9 million in the fiscal 2018 third quarter as compared to $1.5 million in the same prior year period.\nRetail market billings increased 104% to $1.6 million compared with $0.8 million in the prior year period, reflecting significantly increased order activity for the unused medication solutions including the MedSafe in the Retail pharmacy market.\nPharmaceutical Manufacturer billings decreased 29% to $1.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $1.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The decrease is related to the timing of inventory builds for patient support programs.\nAssisted Living market billings grew 5% to $0.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and third quarter 2018 Home Health Care billings remained consistent at $1.9 million.\nGovernment billings increased 23% to $0.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Government market billings included $0.1 million of orders under the VA’s Blanket Purchase Agreement, consistent with the third quarter of fiscal 2017. MedSafe related orders to the government market were $0.3 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase over billings in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 which were $0.2 million.\nAdditional Operating Results\nSG&A of $2.8 million, or 30% of revenue, for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was consistent with SG&A of $2.8 million, or 32% of revenue, in the third quarter of the prior year.\nSharps recorded an EBITDA loss of ($0.3 million) in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as compared to EBITDA loss of ($0.2 million) in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. (See Reconciliation of Net Loss to EBITDA in the supplemental table included at the end of this release).\nFirst Nine Months 2018 Review\nSharps recorded revenue of $30.2 million in the first nine months of 2018, an increase of 9% compared to revenue of $27.8 million in the first nine months of 2017. Customer billings increased 9% to $30.0 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. Professional billings increased 9.3% to $9.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 as compared to $8.8 million in the prior year period. In the first nine months of fiscal 2018, Retail billings increased 25% to $5.6 million as compared to $4.5 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. Pharmaceutical Manufacturer billings decreased 13% to $4.0 million in the first nine months of 2018 as compared to $4.6 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. Home Health Care billings increased 4% to $6.0 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 as compared to $5.8 million in the prior year period. Assisted Living billings increased 5% to $1.9 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. Government billings increased 19% to $1.5 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 as compared to $1.2 million in the prior year period.\nGross margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was 28.0%, down slightly as compared to 29.5% in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. Nine-month gross margin was impacted by unplanned incremental costs associated with winter storms in the Northeast and the lower margin associated with the launch of a new unused medication program detailed above. SG&A expense was reduced by 11% to $8.3 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018. The first nine months of the prior year included $0.7 million of one-time expenses related to Sharps’ acquisition of Citiwaste. Without these costs, SG&A for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 was $8.7 million. The decrease in adjusted SG&A of $0.3 million reflects the impact of cost savings initiatives launched in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The Company recorded an operating loss of $0.5 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2018 as compared to an operating loss of $1.8 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017.\nNet loss for the first nine months of fiscal 2018 was $0.5 million or ($0.03) per basic and diluted share, compared to a net loss of $1.9 million or a net loss of ($0.12) per basic and diluted share in the first nine months of fiscal 2017. During the first nine months of 2017, the Company recorded approximately $0.7 million in acquisition related expenses associated with the completion of its acquisition of Citiwaste. Excluding these acquisition related expenses, on a non-GAAP basis, the Company reported an adjusted net loss of $1.2 million or ($0.07) per diluted share in the first nine months of 2017. ( See Supplemental Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Net Loss Per Share in the supplemental table included at the end of this release).\nFinancial Flexibility and a Strong Balance Sheet\nCash and cash equivalents were $5.5 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $4.7 million at June 30, 2017. The Company had working capital of $10.4 million at March 31, 2018 compared to $10.5 million at June 30, 2017.\nLooking Forward\nMr. Tusa concluded, “We continue to position the Company as a comprehensive service provider to multiple markets, offering many solutions including medical waste management via a mail back or pick-up and market leading unused medication management solutions, through our TakeAway Medication Recovery System Envelope or our MedSafe collection receptacle and liner program. We believe each of these markets represents an estimated $1 billion opportunity with Sharps Compliance positioned as a leading provider thereby creating a significant and unique opportunity for the Company.\"\nThird Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Webcast and Conference Call\nThe Company will host a teleconference today beginning at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time, during which management will review the financial and operating results for the period and discuss Sharps’ corporate strategy and outlook.

Other companies may define EBITDA differently. EBITDA is presented because it is a financial measure that is frequently requested by third parties. However, EBITDA is not considered under generally accepted accounting principles as a primary measure of an entity’s financial results, and accordingly, EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to operating income, net income, or cash flows as determined under generally accepted accounting principles and as reported by the Company.
