    "text": "April 20, 2018 / 1:00 PM / Updated 7 hours ago Hammond - looks like markets were out of step with BoE's Carney Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - British finance minister Philip Hammond said on Friday that it looked like financial markets had been out of step with Bank of England Governor Mark Carney, whose comments a day earlier dampened expectations for an interest rate hike in May. Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, leaves 11 Downing Street, in central London, Britain March 21, 2018. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo \nCarney roiled markets after he described recent data as “mixed” and said there could be differences of opinion among policymakers at their next meeting, putting into doubt widespread market expectations of an interest rate hike next month. \n“What we can conclude from yesterday, not least because (Carney) said it himself, is that he felt it was important that he clarify to the market where their expectation should be anchored,” Hammond told reporters in Washington. \n“And the reaction of sterling suggests that perhaps their expectations were out of line with what the governor thought they should be.” \nSterling extended its drop to a two-week low against the dollar on Friday on the back of Carney’s comments. \nHammond repeated his view that he was optimistic - or “tiggerish” - about Britain’s economic prospects.
