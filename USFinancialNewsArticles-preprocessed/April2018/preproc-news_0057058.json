    "text": "By Sy Mukherjee April 26, 2018\nRight ahead of this week’s wide release of Marvel’s hotly anticipated Avengers: Infinity War , American Airlines is teaming up with the Avengers themselves to fight cancer.\nAmerican Airlines, the group Stand Up to Cancer, and Marvel studios banded together to create a custom-wrapped airplane that features Avengers and Infinity War characters like Captain America, Iron Man, Black Panther, and others. Also pictured are cancer researchers from Stand Up to Cancer and cancer survivors who work at American Airlines.\nSubscribe to Brainstorm Health Daily , our newsletter about the most exciting health innovations.\nThe custom aircraft isn’t just meant to be a poster for Marvel heroes, though. It’s part of a broader cancer awareness and fundraising campaign called “Save Lives Now.” You can make a donation to the campaign here , and American Airlines AAdvantage members who do so will receive 10 miles per donated dollar.\nThe Avengers-stacked airplane will travel between New York and Los Angeles. It was unveiled at the Los Angeles International Airport this week. SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
