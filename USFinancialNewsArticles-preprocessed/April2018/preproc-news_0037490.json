    "text": "Top News \nAmazon Primed \nAmazon’s Prime subscription service now has 100 million paying members, the company has revealed. This is, in fact, the first time Amazon has said how many Prime subscribers there are. CEO Jeff Bezos says a lot of the company’s expansion is happening overseas—the growth is costing more than it brings in for now, analysts say, but Prime membership means loyalty and investors should be happy at the retention rates of over 90%. Bloomberg \nQualcomm and NXP \nQualcomm’s takeover of rival chip firm NXP Semiconductors may have hit a snag in China. Antitrust regulators there said today that an initial review of the deal highlighted “issues that are hard to resolve, making it difficult to eliminate the negative impact.” What does that mean? Who knows—the Commerce Ministry did not elaborate. But: a) This doesn’t mean the regulator will definitely nix the takeover; and b) This does, of course, come in the context of a U.S.-China trade spat, and the U.S.’s decision earlier this week to ban China’s ZTE from buying U.S. tech for seven years. Wall Street Journal \nComcast and 21st Century Fox \nAn SEC filing has revealed more about why 21st Century Fox spurned Comcast’s takeover bid in December, opting to sell to Disney instead. It seems Comcast refused to agree to a breakup fee in the event that Justice Department regulators didn’t agree to the deal going ahead. Disney offered a $2.5 billion fee, so the Murdoch clan went with Disney instead. Another factor was that Disney’s stock was seen as more valuable. New York Times \nP&G and Merck \nProcter & Gamble is buying Merck’s consumer health business, giving P&G new vitamin and food supplements to add to its over-the-counter business. The deal is worth $4.2 billion, and Merck’s OTC sales bring in almost $1 billion a year. Meanwhile, P&G joint venture with Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries will be terminated in July. Fortune Advertisement Around the Water Cooler \nWynn Resorts \nWynn Resorts, stung by allegations of founder Steve Wynn’s sexual misconduct, has added three women to its board. “The Wynn Resorts board now comprises 36% women, bringing Wynn into the top 40 S&P 500 companies in terms of female board representation,” the company said. The new independent directors are Disney veteran Wendy Webb, corporate governance expert Betsy Atkins, and former White House press secretary Dee Dee Myers. BBC \nFacebook’s Facial Recognition \nFacebook may think it’s time to reintroduce facial recognition technology to the EU, but EU privacy regulators aren’t so sure. The problem, which led to the tech being turned off there in 2012, was always that not everyone in Facebook photos consents to having their facial data processed. Despite Facebook’s new drive to comply with EU privacy law, the Irish watchdog (which has jurisdiction over the company) is not convinced that it’s fixed the problem. Fortune \nRamaphosa’s Plan \nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa has outlined his plan for reviving his country’s economy after the immensely damaging tenure of his predecessor, Jacob Zuma. “I’m approaching it with a private-sector lens,” the president (who has a reported worth of $450 million thanks to his years in business) told the Financial Times . And what about Ramaphosa’s backing of land expropriation without compensation? “We are not going to go for a smash-and-grab,” he promised. Financial Times \nFarmers for Trump \nFarmer (and Agri-Business Committee chair) Casey Guernsey writes for Fortune that President Trump, whom he supports, really needs to play ball with international partners China, Canada and Mexico on trade: “We recognize and appreciate Trump’s commitment to protect American interests through trade and are fully aware that China is a bad actor on many fronts… Unfortunately, the unintended consequences of the president’s recent trade actions are already being felt among his most loyal supporters across the heartland.” Fortune \nThis edition of CEO Daily was edited by David Meyer .
