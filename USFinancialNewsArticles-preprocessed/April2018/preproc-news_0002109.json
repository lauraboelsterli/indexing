Our business development group will be enhanced by his leadership. As we have communicated, partnering is a key part of Prometic's financing strategy, and Bruce's expertise will be of great value as our initiatives to complete one or more licensing agreements for PBI-4050 and RYPLAZIM™ gain momentum.\"\nMr. Bruce Wendel, newly appointed Chief Business Development Officer, said \"This is an exciting time for Prometic, with PBI-4050 now entering late stage clinical development and RYPLAZIM™ progressing through regulatory review. I am thrilled to have the opportunity to take a more active role and to lead the business development efforts as we pursue a successful future for the company.\"\nAbout Bruce Wendel\nMr. Wendel's most recent executive role was as Chief Strategic Officer of Hepalink USA, the U.S. subsidiary of Shenzhen Hepalink Pharmaceutical Company. From January to December 2010, he was Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Abraxis BioScience, LLC (NASDAQ: ABII), where he oversaw the development and commercialization of Abraxane® and led the negotiations that culminated in the acquisition of Abraxis by Celgene for over $2.9 billion. Prior to Abraxis, Mr. Wendel worked at American Pharmaceutical Partners, a NASDAQ-listed generic drug manufacturer, serving in business and corporate development roles of increasing responsibility. In 2008, American Pharmaceutical Partners was acquired by Fresenius SE for $3.7 billion.

( www.prometic.com ) is a biopharmaceutical corporation with two drug discovery platforms focusing on unmet medical needs in the field of fibrosis and orphan diseases. The first platform, small molecule therapeutics, stems from the discovery of two receptors GPR40/GPR84 acting as \"dual master switches\" which are at the core of the healing process as opposed to fibrosis. The second platform, plasma-derived therapeutics, leverages Prometic's vast experience in bioseparation technologies to address unmet medical needs with therapeutic proteins not currently commercially available, such as Ryplazim™ (plasminogen human). Prometic is also leveraging the second platform higher recovery yield advantage to develop some more established plasma-derived therapeutics with significant growth in demand such as Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG) and provides access to its proprietary bioseparation technologies to enable pharmaceutical companies in their production of non-competing biopharmaceuticals. Globally recognized as a bioseparations expert, the Corporation derives revenue from this activity through sales of affinity chromatography media which contributes to offset the costs of its own R&D investments. Headquartered in Laval (Canada), Prometic has R&D facilities in the UK, the U.S. and Canada, manufacturing facilities in the UK and commercial activities in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements about Prometic's objectives, strategies and businesses that involve risks and uncertainties.
