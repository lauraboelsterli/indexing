    "text": "Published: Apr 6, 2018 3:39 p.m. ET Share \nPresident has criticized Amazon over sales tax payments \nBy Getty Images A doorman stands outside of Trump Tower in Manhattan. \nThe Trump administration is pushing for online retailers to pay more in state and local taxes. One retailer that could be affected by a stricter tax policy: the online store of the Trump Organization, which collects sales tax from consumers in only two states. \nThe TrumpStore.com website, which sells $100 polo shirts, baseball caps, spa teddy bears and other Trump-branded merchandise, collects sales tax on orders shipped to addresses in Florida and Louisiana, according to the company’s website. \nThe site, which describes itself as the official retail website of the Trump Organization, doesn’t collect sales taxes from New York residents. The TrumpStore.com website invites shoppers to “visit our brand new Trump Tower flagship retail store” in New York City. \nThe website was registered by the Trump Organization, which is headquartered in Trump Tower. The website contains information about the retail store and the e-commerce site, but it is unclear how ownership of the entities is structured.",
