    "text": "April 10 (Reuters) - Creditors of India's Monnet Ispat and Energy Ltd have approved a joint bid here from AION Investments and JSW Steel to take over the bankrupt firm, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday.\nMonnet Ispat is among India's 12 biggest loan defaulters here , which were pushed into bankruptcy last year, as part of the country's new bankruptcy law aimed at cutting close to $150 billion of accumulated soured loans.\nMonnet Ispatâ€™s committee of creditors approved the resolution plan from AION Investments and JSW Steel by favourable votes of close to 99 percent, the company said in the stock exchange filing.\nIt did not provide any details of the takeover offer.\nMonnet Ispat, which manufactures steel and is also involved in power generation, owes banks and other creditors 104.12 billion rupees here ($1.6 billion), according to government data.\nLeading Indian steelmaker JSW Steel has also bid for another bankrupt steelmaker Essar Steel India in a partnership.\nCreditors have so far finalised winning bidders for at least two other bankrupt steelmakers. Tata Steel is taking over Bhushan Steel, while Vedanta Ltd has won bids for Electrosteel Steels Ltd.\n$1 = 64.9875 Indian rupees Reporting by Jessica Kuruthukulangara in Bengaluru, Editing by Sherry Jacob-Phillips\n ",
