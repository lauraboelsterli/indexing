Global output this year is estimated at around 65 million tonnes.\n“The temporary conditional suspension shall continue until further notice, allowing the LME to engage with stakeholders to determine the appropriate longer-term approach, the LME said in a notice that followed Reuters conversation with Chamberlain.\nChamberlain said on the sidelines of a copper conference in Santiago that Rusal’s aluminium which came into LME approved warehouses before the sanctions were imposed last Friday would not be affected.\n“The LME recognises that certain members and clients are concerned that if they were...to take delivery of LME Warrants relating to metal of Rusal Brands, this could place them at risk of violating the Sanctions,” the notice said.\n“If a given brand creates issues...for a sufficiently large number of market participants, then the LME will consider appropriate actions, which may include suspension or delisting of the brand.”\nData from the exchange showed aluminium stocks in LME warehouses originating from producers in Eastern Europe stood at 450,650 tonnes as of April 6. Sources say this category would mostly be metal produced by Rusal.\nThat is about 36 percent of total aluminium stocks at 1.26 million tonnes as of that day.\nBanks involved in metal trade financing are likely to be extremely cautious after French bank BNP Paribas in 2015 paid $8.9 billion to settle claims it violated sanctions against Sudan, Cuba and Iran.\nReporting by Peter Hobson and Eric Onstad; writing by Pratima Desai; editing by Veronica Brown\n ",
