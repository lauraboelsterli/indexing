    "text": "SEATTLE, WA, April 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- VisionGate is pleased to announce the appointment of two new members to the Board of Directors, significantly expanding the depth of biotech leadership and business acumen within the company.\nMaria Forero, MPH, Board Director, is founder and principal of Ridgetop Health, the life sciences private equity arm of Ridgetop Capital Partners, a $500 million AUM investment firm. Prior to Ridgetop, Maria spent ten years at Novartis in numerous senior management roles across geographies and divisions including Head of Sales & Marketing for Sandoz Latin America and General Manager of Spain & Portugal for Novartis Vaccines. Before Novartis, Ms. Forero was a VP at Morgan Stanley and an Audit Manager at PricewaterhouseCoopers in London. She holds a Master of Public Health from Columbia University, New York, and a BSc in Human Genetics, from the University College London, UK.\nPaul Kelly, MBA, Board Director, is an analyst, consultant, and investor in the biotechnology sector for more than twenty years. He has had extended and successful assignments as an equity analyst at many top-tier firms where his principal focus was the genomics, tools, and diagnostics subsector of biotechnology. Subsequently, Mr. Kelly engaged in consulting for biotechnology companies, and for hedge funds. He currently manages his own investments, continues his consulting activities, and serves on the Board of Relmada Therapeutics. Mr. Kelly holds an AB in Biochemistry from Brown University, he attended the University of Rochester School of Medicine, and received an MBA in Finance from the University of Rochester.\n“As we advance late stage product development and accelerate our commercial readiness it is particularly advantageous for the Company to strengthen its board with two highly experienced biotech industry executives,” CEO and Founder Dr. Alan Nelson said in a statement. “Both Maria and Paul know our technology well and bring exceptional experience in the pharmaceutical and diagnostics industries. We are thrilled to be adding their leadership and guidance to the Board of Directors of VisionGate,” added Dr. Nelson.\nFor more information on VisionGate, please visit www.visiongate3d.com .\n###\nAbout VisionGate, Inc.\nVisionGate is a clinical stage oncology pharmaceutical and diagnostics company focused on the early detection and prevention of cancer. Our lead investigative pharmaceutical drug is oral iloprost, currently in clinical development for the treatment of pre-cancerous bronchial dysplasia and the prevention of lung cancer following a successful Phase 2 clinical trial. The LuCED ® lung test will be the companion diagnostic for oral iloprost. VisionGate’s proprietary LuCED lung test is a non-invasive liquid biopsy diagnostic test in development for detection of early-stage lung cancer, demonstrating exquisite sensitivity and specificity in blinded clinical studies. This non-invasive sputum test is processed on the world’s first automated 3D single cell imaging and analysis technology, the Cell-CT™ platform, named aptly because it is similar in principle to taking a CT scan of individual cells, but using visible light without harmful radiation. With 176 issued patents in 13 countries, VisionGate expects to play a leading role in the battle against lung cancer - the world’s number one cancer killer. VisionGate, Inc. is led by Dr. Alan Nelson, physicist, bioengineer, and serial entrepreneur who previously developed the world’s first and only automated screening test to detect cervical cancer, marketed globally today as FocalPoint by Becton Dickinson. The LuCED lung test is a product in development and is not currently available commercially.\nAbout the Cell-CT™ 3D Imaging Platform\nThe automated Cell-CT™ 3-Dimensional Single Cell Imaging and Analysis Platform is the enabling technology which produces high-resolution 3D images of individual cells using a technique called optical computed tomography. This 3D optical CT platform breaks new ground in the field of quantitative cell analysis by its unique ability to compute the true 3D internal structure of cells based on molecular optical absorption densities. The Cell-CT platform produces high-resolution 3D images of individual cells and measures hundreds of critical disease indicators in each cell. Together with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, these produce accurate cell classifications that aid in the early detection of disease. Additionally, the Cell-CT platform has the potential to deliver molecular and genetic biosignatures of disease longitudinally to compliment drug development in the biopharma services arena. Cells are not placed on slides, but rather, they are suspended in fluid (liquid biopsy) and injected through a micro-capillary tube that permits multiple viewing perspectives around 360°. The Cell-CT platform is a device under development and not currently cleared in the US.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for VisionGate\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and made in reliance on the \"safe harbor\" provisions of said act.
