    "text": "The 10 states where student debt is a big problem The Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, has come out with a map of student loan debt. Debt is higher in some states than others â€” and so is the amount in default. CNBC.com \nStudent loan debt in America has been called a crisis. \nThe loans many students take out to cover their education can impair them from owning houses and saving for retirement later in life. \nAnd many others can't even make their monthly payments. Some 40 percent of borrowers are expected to default on their loans by 2023. \nIn some states, the situation is worse than others. \nThat's the takeaway from a new project by The Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, which has mapped student loan debt across the country. \nHere are 10 states hit hard by student loans. 1) Washington, D.C. The U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. \nShare of residents with student loan debt: 21% \nMedian student loan debt: $24,131 \nMedian student loan debt in collections: $10,154 2) New Hampshire Denis Tangney Jr. | Getty Images Nashua is a city in Hillsborough County, New Hampshire and is the second largest city in the state. \nShare of residents with student loan debt: 20% \nMedian student loan debt: $18,777 \nMedian student loan debt in collections: $10,861 3) Pennsylvania",
