    "text": "Published: Apr 25, 2018 6:23 p.m. ET Share\nRivals seek to take advantage of weakened conglomerate Getty Images GE’s life-sciences unit could be worth more than $20 billion.\nBy Dana Cimilluca Thomas Gryta\nDanaher Corp. recently expressed interest in a deal for General Electric Co.’s life-sciences business, but GE didn’t engage and isn’t interested in a deal, according to people familiar with the matter.\nThe structure and value of the proposed transaction couldn’t be determined, and the people said there are no active discussions. GE’s life-sciences business, which had about $4.6 billion in revenue last year, sells lab supplies such as blood-collection kits as well as equipment for biotechnology drug production and research.\nThe unit could be worth more than $20 billion, according to analyst estimates and based on how much life-sciences businesses have fetched in recent deals.\nThe abortive approach by Danaher DHR, +1.28% is one of a number GE GE, +2.35% has received for various businesses recently as competitors seek to gain advantage from its weakness, and shows how the once-mighty company’s fortunes have fallen.
