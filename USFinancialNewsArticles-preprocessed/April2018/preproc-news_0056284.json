    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- National Oilwell Varco, Inc. (NYSE: NOV) today reported a first quarter 2018 net loss of $68 million, or $0.18 per share. Revenues for the first quarter were $1.80 billion, a decrease of nine percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of three percent from the first quarter of 2017. Operating loss for the first quarter of 2018 was $1 million, or 0.1 percent of sales, and Adjusted EBITDA (operating profit excluding depreciation, amortization, and other items) was $160 million, or 8.9 percent of sales. Other items were a net credit of $12 million, pre-tax, primarily from the reversal of certain accruals, partially offset by restructure charges and severance payments.\n“During the first quarter of 2018 NOV benefitted from growing demand for short-cycle consumables and services in North America as oilfield fundamentals continued to strengthen,” commented Clay Williams, Chairman, President, and CEO. “Unfortunately, however, the protracted budgeting cycle we saw early in the year led to a slower-than-anticipated start in our capital equipment businesses, and softness in our Eastern Hemisphere operations. This more than offset improvements in North America, snapping our six-quarter streak of steadily improving results.”\n“We expect to be back on track soon, though, as most of the capital equipment deliveries that were deferred by customers at the end of the quarter were accepted early in the second quarter, giving us confidence that the general upward trajectory of business will resume in the second quarter. Scarcity is returning to many corners of the oilfield, and we’ve seen good uptake on technologies we’ve been introducing through the downturn, all while the oil supply and demand picture continues to tighten.”\nWellbore Technologies\nWellbore Technologies generated revenues of $711 million in the first quarter of 2018, a decrease of one percent from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of 28 percent from the first quarter of 2017. The sequential decrease in revenue was the result of a slow start to the year in the Eastern Hemisphere and a fall-off in drill pipe sales, partially offset by strong growth from the segment’s operations in the Western Hemisphere. Operating profit was $12 million, or 1.7 percent of sales. Adjusted EBITDA was $103 million, or 14.5 percent of sales, a decrease of four percent sequentially and an increase of $65 million from the prior year.\nCompletion & Production Solutions\nCompletion & Production Solutions generated revenues of $670 million, a decrease of three percent from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of three percent from the first quarter of 2017. Deferred deliveries and order commitments led to the sequential decline in revenue. Operating profit was $16 million or 2.4 percent of sales. Adjusted EBITDA was $73 million, or 10.9 percent of sales, a decrease of one percent sequentially and a decrease of five percent from the prior year.\nBacklog for capital equipment orders for Completion & Production Solutions at March 31, 2018 was $1.01 billion. New orders during the quarter, net of the cancellation of a large order for the recently terminated Ca Rong Do project in the South China Sea, were $324 million, representing a book-to-bill of 84 percent when compared to the $384 million of orders shipped from backlog. Excluding the cancellation, book-to-bill was 90 percent.\nRig Technologies\nRig Technologies generated revenues of $483 million, a decrease of 21 percent from the fourth quarter of 2017 and a decrease of 17 percent from the first quarter of 2017. The segment was adversely affected by reduced progress on new offshore rig construction. Operating profit was $18 million, or 3.7 percent of sales. Adjusted EBITDA was $45 million, or 9.3 percent of sales, a decrease of 36 percent sequentially and a decrease of four percent from the prior year.\nBacklog for capital equipment orders for Rig Technologies at March 31, 2018 was $2.05 billion. New orders booked during the quarter totaled $201 million, representing a 131 percent book-to-bill when compared to the $153 million shipped from backlog. The order book included two land rigs destined for the Middle East and several land rig equipment upgrades.\nSignificant Events and Achievements\nNOV won two Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) 2018 Spotlight on New Technology® awards, one for the NOVOS™ process-automation platform and one for the Seabox™ subsea water treatment system. The yearly award showcases the industry’s latest and most advanced technologies—ones that are poised to dramatically change offshore exploration and production and allow the industry to operate more efficiently, safely, and sustainably.\nNOV received multiple large orders for the Tolteq™ iSeries™ measurement-while-drilling (MWD) products in the first quarter, including two large multi-tool orders in the US and one multi-tool order in Russia. Several of these orders include the new iSeries NXT directional module, which provides directional drillers with continuous wellbore position information for more precise control of directional and horizontal drilling operations, allowing more effective geosteering into the drilling sweet spot. Additionally, the Company received its first orders for its iSeries near-bit measurement system, which provides critical formation information from directly above the drill bit to provide early indication of formation changes and enables tighter control of the well within the target zone.\nNOV introduced and began delivery of its next-generation shale shaker, the Brandt™ SABRE™. The first of its kind, SABRE is a modular shaker system based upon a scalable platform. Through a simple field upgrade, the need to change out the complete shaker system is eliminated, allowing customers to easily adapt to specific requirements. Field trials have proven an increase in flow handling capacity of 50 to 100 percent compared to existing high-performance shakers, which allows SABRE to better control low-gravity solids throughout the entire drilling process—reducing dilution and associated logistics costs. The SABRE shaker is also proven to deliver dryer cuttings, reducing both haul-off and disposal costs. Trials indicate that screen costs per foot are reduced with this new technology, with the SABRE shaker’s patented screens being super lightweight (weighing in at only 14 lb) and repairable using NOV’s unique AX SNAPFAST™ screen repair system.\nNOV signed an agreement with Maersk to extend the existing condition-based monitoring (CBM) Partnership agreement from seven to a total of 18 rigs. The new contract expands the list of equipment incorporated in the CBM Partnership to 800 pieces. The partnership will allow Maersk to secure a stronger market position by achieving higher levels of maintenance predictability and execution excellence, in turn increasing reliability and reducing costs across the rig fleet. The partnership reinforces both companies’ commitment to improving total cost of ownership for customers.\nNOV introduced patent-pending TORC™ technology, which is already delivering strong results in Canada’s Deep Basin. NOV’s TORC components incorporate a unique geometry to maximize engagement at predefined depths of cut to reduce over-engagement of cutters, significantly improving torsional stability, toolface control, and drilling efficiency during directional drilling operations. The TORC technology was incorporated into a Tektonic™ TK73 bit and, when ran on back-to-back neighboring wells against a competitor’s incumbent bit, delivered higher instantaneous ROP, reduced reactive torque, steady toolface, and overall lower mechanical-specific energy throughout the run. The effectiveness of the TORC technology was further reinforced on a highly aggressive Seeker™ bit, which achieved excellent performance. The section was landed with an average ROP of 141 ft/hr, over 30 percent faster than the best competitor offset and setting a new field record in the Kaybob field of Alberta, Canada.\nMomentum in NOV’s eVolve™ optimization and automation service business continues to build in markets around the globe. NOV executed automation service contracts with major operators for projects in the North Sea and in the Barents Sea. Both projects have planned spud dates in the summer 2018. Additionally, a major operator awarded NOV a meaningful contract extension for its project on Alaska’s North Slope, affirming the value the operator is realizing from NOV’s proprietary equipment and service offering.\nNOV acquired Western Oiltools Ltd., a Calgary-based manufacturer of production pressure control equipment. Western Oiltools’ innovative product portfolio enhances operator economics by promoting the optimal performance of lift systems, concurrently minimizing service downtime and maximizing production continuity. Highly complementary to NOV’s current offerings, the Western Oiltools’ product suite is currently being used throughout North America and will soon be available to NOV’s global customer base.\nNOV continues to expand its scope of work on the Statoil Johan Castberg and Statoil Johan Sverdrup II developments following successful execution of several packages delivered to the first-phase development of Johan Sverdrup in 2017. NOV will supply separation, produced water, sand handling, and gas-dehydration packages for Johan Castberg and Johan Sverdrup II in 2018. The project includes fabrication at NOV fabrication sites in both Montrose, UK and Midsund, Norway.\nOther Corporate Items\nCash flow used by operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $129 million. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had $1.24 billion in cash and cash equivalents and total debt of $2.71 billion. NOV had $3.0 billion available on its revolving credit facility as of March 31, 2018. The unsecured credit facility matures in June of 2022 and is subject to one primary covenant, a maximum debt-to-capitalization ratio of 60 percent. As of March 31, 2018, NOV had a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 16.1 percent.\nFirst Quarter Earnings Conference Call\nNOV will hold a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 results on April 27, 2018 at 10:00 AM Central Time (11:00 AM Eastern Time). The call will be broadcast simultaneously at www.nov.com/investors .
