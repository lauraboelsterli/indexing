    "text": "DENVER, April 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Jagged Peak Energy LLC (\"JPE LLC\"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jagged Peak Energy Inc. (NYSE: JAG) (\"Jagged Peak\" or the \"Company\"), announced today that it has commenced, subject to market conditions and other factors, a private offering of $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2026 to eligible purchasers (the \"Notes Offering\"). The notes will be guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Jagged Peak.\nThe Company intends to use the net proceeds of the Notes Offering to repay borrowings under its revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.\nThe securities to be offered in the Notes Offering have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), or any state securities laws and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. JPE LLC plans to offer and sell the securities only to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act and to non-U.S. persons in transactions outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act.\nThis news release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities described herein, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws.
