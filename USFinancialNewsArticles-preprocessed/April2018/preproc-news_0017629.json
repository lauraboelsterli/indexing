DeMartino will report directly to CEO Paul Appleby, and help drive the company’s worldwide go-to-market program.\n“As we move into a new era where data is the most valuable asset, you cannot simply claim to use artificial intelligence, machine learning, or graphics processing units (GPUs). Businesses need to be able to use this technology efficiently and effectively to quickly make decisions that optimize their operations and enable new business strategies,” said Appleby. “Bob’s extensive background in global sales and business development, coupled with his domain knowledge and understanding of where the industry is headed, makes him a natural fit to help our customers excel in what has now become the Extreme Data Economy.\"\nA proven executive leader who has helped hundreds of companies derive value and business insights from data, DeMartino brings more than 25 years of experience leading global sales and business development teams. Prior to Kinetica, DeMartino was the vice president of sales and business development at AtScale, and has been part of the big data industry transformation going back to Greenplum, which was acquired by EMC. Before joining AtScale, he spent 15 years at Sun Microsystems in various executive leadership roles where he was responsible for a $500 million revenue unit and served on the company's sales and leadership council. Bobby holds a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Pittsburgh.\n“Kinetica is on a mission to help enterprises build a foundation for the data-powered business,” said DeMartino. “I am excited to work in concert with our prospects, customers and partners to grow and scale together as we build differentiated industry solutions that harness the power of extreme data.”\nKinetica helps businesses build a foundation for thriving in the Extreme Data Economy so they can develop business strategies that harness data as a strength for profitable change. Since closing its $50M Series A round in June 2017, Kinetica has experienced rapid expansion around the globe.\nAbout Kinetica\nWhen extreme data requires companies to act with unprecedented agility, Kinetica powers business in motion.
