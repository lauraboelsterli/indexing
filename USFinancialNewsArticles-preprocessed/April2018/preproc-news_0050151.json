    "text": "IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Opus Bank (\"Opus\") (NASDAQ: “OPB”) announced today net income of $12.9 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018 compared to net income of $1.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2017 and net income of $7.7 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. Net income for the first quarter of 2018 included $1.5 million of strategic initiative and severance related expenses, $1.4 million of seasonally higher employer payroll taxes, and a $2.9 million recovery of professional services expense related to the settlement of a legal matter.\nAdditionally, Opus announced today that its Board of Directors has approved increasing its quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $0.11 per common share payable on May 17, 2018 to common stockholders and to its Series A Preferred stockholders of record as of May 3, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nPre-tax pre-provision earnings increased 14% from the prior quarter to $20.9 million and increased 13% from the first quarter of 2017. Net interest margin increased five basis points to 3.20%, as the yield on Opus' originated loans increased six basis points to 4.22%, while our cost of deposits increased two basis points to 0.47%. New loan fundings were $452.3 million, an increase of 106% from the first quarter of 2017. Total loans increased $55.8 million, driven by new loan fundings exceeding loan payoffs and sales of $271.4 million, which included planned exits of $52.2 million. Excluding planned exits, total loans would have increased by $108.0 million in the first quarter of 2018. Total deposits increased $99.7 million, primarily driven by growth in low- or no-cost commercial business demand deposits. Noninterest expense decreased 5% to $44.1 million and the efficiency ratio decreased to 68%, compared to 71% in the prior quarter. Enterprise Value loans decreased $81.7 million, or 20%, in the first quarter of 2018 to $336.0 million. Provision for loan losses was $3.9 million, compared to $3.0 million for the prior quarter. Net charge-offs were $12.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, of which 95% were Enterprise Value or Technology loans with $8.2 million of specific reserves. Opus' effective tax rate was 24% for the first quarter.\nStephen H. Gordon, Chief Executive Officer and President of Opus Bank, stated, “Opus’ first quarter results marked a successful beginning to 2018, demonstrated by our disciplined growth and improving profitability, displaying continued momentum from 2017. We achieved $452 million in new loan fundings during the quarter, more than double the level achieved in the first quarter of 2017. New loan fundings exceeded loan payoffs of $271 million, which included planned exits of $52 million, as we successfully reduced the balances of Enterprise Value loans by 20% in the first quarter. Deposit growth of $100 million was driven by low- or no-cost commercial business demand deposits, which enabled our overall cost of deposits to increase by only two basis points. We also began to realize the benefit of our asset sensitive balance sheet, as our net interest margin expanded by five basis points during the quarter.”\nMr. Gordon continued, “Consistent with past years, we estimate our quarterly loan production will ramp over the course of 2018, driven by our leading multifamily banking division and bolstered by the contributions from numerous commercial bankers hired throughout our footprint over the recent quarters. Deposit and full relationship growth is a high priority across the organization, including and especially among our Commercial and Specialty Banking teams, and is expected to ramp throughout 2018. Our cost of deposits will likely increase in coming quarters, but at a slower rate than our loan yields increase. With our portfolio of Enterprise Value loans that are not eligible for retention continuing to shrink, we anticipate planned exits will have less of a negative impact on our quarterly net loan growth, loan yield, and overall credit expenses. As we entered the second quarter, the weighted average rate of our new loan fundings pipeline was 34-basis-points higher than at the start of the first quarter, which we anticipate will contribute to a higher net interest margin going forward. Our noninterest expense run rate was reduced in the first quarter, and we remain confident in our ability to drive our efficiency ratio below 65%.”\nMr. Gordon concluded, “I thank all of the many Opus team members responsible for our strong start to the year, as we take great pride in their tireless efforts and commitment. Based on our earnings, strong capital levels and overall performance in the first quarter of 2018, I am proud to announce Opus’ Board has authorized a 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.11 per diluted share.”\nLoans\nTotal loans held-for-investment increased $55.8 million, or 1%, to $5.2 billion as of March 31, 2018, from $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2017 and decreased $203.1 million, or 4%, from $5.4 billion as of March 31, 2017. The increase in total loans during the first quarter of 2018 was driven by new loan fundings of $452.3 million, partially offset by loan payoffs of $271.4 million, which included planned exits of $52.2 million.\nLoan Balance Roll Forward (unaudited) Three Months Ended ($ in millions) March 31, 2018\nDecember 31,\n2017\nSeptember 30,\n2017\nJune 30, 2017\nMarch 31,\n2017\nBeginning loan balance $ 5,173.2 $ 5,060.6 $ 5,218.1 $ 5,432.1 $ 5,669.1 New loan fundings 452.3 502.3 375.4 362.2 219.1 Loan payoffs (219.2 ) (237.8 ) (267.1 ) (357.0 ) (239.8 ) Loan sales¹ -- -- (6.0 ) (15.8 ) (38.6 ) Planned exits (52.2 ) (80.6 ) (161.2 ) (137.2 ) (95.3 ) Other² (125.1 ) (71.3 ) (98.6 ) (66.2 ) (82.4 ) Ending loan balance $ 5,229.0 $ 5,173.2 $ 5,060.6 $ 5,218.1 $ 5,432.1 [1] Loan sales that were not planned exits [2] Includes normal amortization and charge-offs New loan fundings in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $452.3 million, a decrease of $50.1 million, or 10%, from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase of $233.1 million, or 106%, from the first quarter of 2017. Commercial and Specialty Banking division loans comprised $171.3 million, or 38%, of total new loan fundings, and Commercial Real Estate Banking loans comprised $281.0, or 62%, of total new loan fundings in the first quarter.\nLoan commitments originated during the first quarter of 2018 totaled $439.2 million, compared to $454.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 and $209.7 million during the first quarter of 2017. As of March 31, 2018, our unfunded commitments on originated loans totaled $413.6 million.\nOur acquired loan portfolio totaled $128.6 million as of March 31, 2018, a decrease of 3% from $132.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and 20% from $160.3 million as of March 31, 2017. The acquired loan portfolio had a remaining discount of $2.1 million as of March 31, 2018.\nCash and Investment Securities\nCash and investment securities totaled $1.4 billion as of March 31, 2018, compared to $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2017 and $1.9 billion as of March 31, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $208.5 million, or 42%, during the first quarter of 2018 to $292.2 million, and decreased $733.9 million, or 72%, from the first quarter of 2017. The reduction in cash and cash equivalents in the first quarter of 2018 was primarily driven by the payoff of $280.0 million of FHLB advances that were added at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. Investment securities decreased $29.5 million, or 3%, during the first quarter of 2018 to $1.1 billion, and increased $197.8 million, or 22%, from $900.0 million as of March 31, 2017.\nDeposits and Borrowings\nDeposits increased $99.7 million, or 2%, to $6.0 billion as of March 31, 2018, from $5.9 billion as of December 31, 2017, and decreased by $676.5 million, or 10%, from $6.7 billion as of March 31, 2017. Deposit growth during the first quarter was primarily driven by our Commercial and Specialty Banking divisions.\nTotal demand deposits, including both noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand deposit accounts, increased to 56% of total deposits as of March 31, 2018, compared to 55% as of December 31, 2017 and 52% as of March 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, business deposits represented 63% of total deposits.\nOur loan to deposit ratio was 87% as of March 31, 2018, unchanged from the prior quarter and an increase from 81% as of March 31, 2017.\nFederal Home Loan Bank advances decreased to $10.0 million as of March 31, 2018 compared to $290.0 million as of December 31, 2017, and were unchanged compared to March 31, 2017. Borrowings from the Federal Home Loan bank during the fourth quarter were paid off early in the first quarter of 2018, reflected in the low first quarter average balance of $16.4 million.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income was $51.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $52.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 and $56.1 million for the first quarter of 2017.\nInterest income from loans increased $1.0 million, or 2%, to $54.6 million for the first quarter of 2018, driven by higher average balances of loans and loan rate resets, partially offset by loan payoffs and prepayments, including planned exits during the quarter. While planned exits decrease our potential future credit volatility, they had a negative impact on our loan interest income.\nInterest income from cash and investment securities decreased $1.2 million, or 17%, from the prior quarter to $6.0 million for the first quarter of 2018. Interest income from investment securities decreased $881,000, or 15%, during the first quarter to $5.1 million, driven by lower average balances of investment securities compared to the prior quarter and higher prepayments during the first quarter that resulted in higher premium amortization. Interest income from cash decreased $314,000 from the prior quarter to $951,000 for the first quarter of 2018, as the average balance of cash decreased $138.6 million, or 36%.\nInterest expense increased 2% to $9.0 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $8.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, and decreased 2% compared to $9.2 million for the first quarter of 2017. While the average balance of deposits remained relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, interest expense on deposits increased 2% as the weighted average rate of deposits increased during the quarter.\nNet Interest Margin\nNet interest margin on a taxable equivalent basis increased five basis points to 3.20% in the first quarter of 2018 from 3.15% in the fourth quarter of 2017, and increased six basis points from 3.14% in the first quarter of 2017. The linked-quarter change was due to an increase in total loan yield of three basis points to 4.25%, which was positively impacted by loan rate resets, higher balances of originated loans, and two fewer days in the quarter, offset by planned exits, which had a weighted average rate of 7.38%. Net interest margin was negatively impacted by a 21 basis point decrease in the yield on investment securities to 1.87%, driven by higher premium amortization, and a higher cost of deposits, which increased by two basis points to 0.47% for the first quarter of 2018.\nNoninterest Income\nNoninterest income increased 5% to $13.3 million in the first quarter of 2018 from $12.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and increased 6% from $12.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Noninterest income during the first quarter of 2018 included $1.7 million of treasury management and deposit account fees, $7.0 million in trust administrative fees from our alternative asset IRA custodian subsidiary, $1.4 million from our Escrow and Exchange divisions, and $838,000 from Opus' Merchant Banking division. Total noninterest income in the first quarter of 2018 included a net increase in equity warrant valuations of $108,000, compared to a net decrease of $554,000 in the prior quarter, as well as net gains on the sale of investment securities and other assets totaling $232,000.\nNoninterest income made up 20% of total revenues during the first quarter of 2018, unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase from 18% in the first quarter of 2017.\nNoninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense decreased 5% to $44.1 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $46.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, and decreased 12% from $50.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Noninterest expense during the first quarter of 2018 included $802,000 of strategic initiative related expenses, $735,000 of severance expense, and $1.4 million of seasonally higher compensation and benefits expense related to higher employer taxes paid in the first quarter. Offsetting these expenses was a $2.9 million recovery of previously incurred professional services expenses related to the settlement of a legal matter during the quarter. This legal case had a $750,000 per quarter professional services expense run rate that will not be incurred going forward.\nIncome Tax Expense\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") was signed into law, which, among other items, reduced the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, and resulted in additional income tax expense totaling $9.0 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result, our effective tax rate decreased to 24% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 34% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and an effective tax rate of 39% in the first quarter of 2017.\nAsset Quality\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, we continued to reduce our exposure to previously de-emphasized loan portfolios. Total Enterprise Value loans were reduced by $81.7 million, or 20%, during the first quarter of 2018 and totaled $336.0 million as of March 31, 2018. Planned exits through loan payoffs and sales totaled $52.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, as Opus continued to reduce the balances of loans we previously announced as targeted for planned exits. As a result of the successful exit of previously identified loan relationships, the reserves associated with these loans were released, which reduced the allowance for loan losses as required under our methodology.\nOur allowance for loan losses was $67.8 million, or 1.30% of our total loan portfolio, as of March 31, 2018, compared to $75.9 million, or 1.47%, as of December 31, 2017 and $112.2 million, or 2.07%, as of March 31, 2017. The reduction in the allowance for loan losses during the first quarter of 2018 was driven by charge-offs of $14.2 million, partially offset by net recoveries of $2.2 million and a provision for loan losses of $3.9 million.\nWe recorded a provision expense of $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to a provision expense of $3.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a provision expense of $6.0 million in the first quarter of 2017. The provision expense during the first quarter of 2018 was driven by $12.0 million of net charge-offs, $4.4 million from risk rating migration, and $3.2 million due to higher loss factors used to determine loan loss reserves in accordance with our methodology. These factors were partially offset by a $9.9 million decline in reserves as a result of the changes in portfolio mix, fundings, and planned exits of loan relationships, and a reduction of $5.8 million in specific reserves.\nOpus recorded net charge-offs of $12.0 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to net charge-offs of $5.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $5.1 million in the first quarter of 2017. Charge-offs during the first quarter of 2018 were predominantly comprised of one Technology Banking loan relationship, two Commercial Banking division loan relationships, and one Corporate Finance loan relationship, which previously had specific reserves of $8.2 million.\nTotal nonperforming assets were $63.8 million, or 0.87% of total assets, as of March 31, 2018, compared to $58.3 million, or 0.78% of total assets, as of December 31, 2017, and $87.0 million, or 1.09% of total assets, as of March 31, 2017. The ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total nonaccrual loans was 106% as of March 31, 2018, compared to 130% as of December 31, 2017 and 129% as of March 31, 2017.\nTotal criticized loans decreased $2.3 million, or 1%, to $247.4 million as of March 31, 2018 compared to $249.8 million as of December 31, 2017 , and decreased $112.0 million, or 31%, from $359.4 million as of March 31, 2017. The net decrease in total criticized loans during the first quarter of 2018 was driven by $9.6 million of upgrades and $51.1 million of loan exits, including payoffs, loan sales, charge-offs, and normal amortization during the quarter, partially offset by $58.4 million of downgrades. Classified loans decreased $8.7 million and special mention loans increased $6.4 million in the first quarter of 2018. The decrease in classified loans was driven by upgrades of $1.1 million as well as payoffs, charge-offs, and normal amortization of $47.9 million, partially offset by downgrades of $40.3 million. The increase in special mention loans was driven by $39.5 million of downgrades, partially offset by $8.4 million of upgrades and $24.7 million of loan payoffs, normal amortization, and migration.\nThe net decrease in total criticized loans consisted primarily of a $16.8 million decrease in commercial business loans and a $14.6 million increase in real estate secured loans. Commercial business loans comprised $5.1 million of loans upgraded out of criticized categories and $49.0 million of loan exits, including loan payoffs, loan sales, charge-offs, and normal amortization, partially offset by $37.3 million of downgrades during the first quarter of 2018. Real estate secured loans comprised $21.0 million of downgrades during the first quarter of 2018, partially offset by $4.4 million of loans upgraded out of criticized categories and $2.0 million of loan payoffs and amortization.\nCapital\nAs of March 31, 2018, our Tier 1 leverage ratio was 9.53%, Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.92% and total risk-based capital ratio was 14.91%, compared to 9.44%, 10.94% and 14.97%, respectively, as of December 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2017, our Tier 1 leverage, Common Equity Tier 1, and total risk-based capital ratios were 8.19%, 10.03% and 13.45%, respectively.

Our tangible book value per as converted common share was $17.23 as of March 31, 2018 compared to $17.26 as of December 31, 2017 and $16.23 as of March 31, 2017.\nConference Call and Webcast Details\nDate: Monday, April 23, 2018\nTime: 8:00 a.m. PT (11:00 a.m. ET)\nPhone Number: (855) 265-3237\nConference ID: 1857796\nWebcast URL: http://investor.opusbank.com/event\nAnalysts, investors, and the general public may listen to the Bank's discussion of its first quarter performance and participate in the question/answer session by using the phone number listed above or through a live webcast of the conference available through a link on the investor relations page of Opus' website at: http://investor.opusbank.com/event .

Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\"). We believe that the presentation of certain non-GAAP financial measures assists investors in evaluating our financial results. These non-GAAP measures include our return on average tangible equity and tangible book value per as converted common share. These non-GAAP measures should be taken together with the corresponding GAAP measures and should not be considered a substitute of the GAAP measures.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of the most comparable GAAP financial measures and ratios to the non-GAAP financial measures and ratios:\nNon-GAAP tax adjusted return on average assets (unaudited) Three Months Ended ($ in thousands) March 31,\n2018 December 31,\n2017 March 31,\n2017 Average assets $ 7,309,089 $ 7,350,090 $ 7,876,003 Tax adjusted net income Net income $ 12,904 $ 1,201 $ 7,657 Less: Adjustments due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — 8,968 — Tax adjusted net income 12,904 10,169 7,657 Return on average assets 0.72 % 0.06 % 0.39 % Non-GAAP tax adjusted return on average assets (1) 0.72 % 0.55 % 0.39 % (1) Tax adjusted for the three months ended December 31, 2017 due to impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
