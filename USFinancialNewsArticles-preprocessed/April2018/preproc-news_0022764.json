    "text": "April 11, 2018 / 11:32 AM / Updated 19 minutes ago Russian PM eyes U.S. goods as Moscow mulls response to sanctions Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nMOSCOW, April 11 (Reuters) - Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Wednesday that Moscow should look at U.S. goods or goods produced in Russia by U.S. companies when considering a possible response to sanctions imposed on Moscow by Washington. \nThe U.S. sanctions, announced on Friday, target officials and business people around President Vladimir Putin in an aggressive response to alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. The sanctions have triggered steep falls in the rouble and some Russian stocks. \nSpeaking before Russia’s lower house of parliament, Medvedev said the new sanctions were an attempt to capture global markets for U.S. companies. \n“Measures in response should be well thought-out, not inflict harm to ourselves, and be appropriate. I do not rule out that... we will have to weigh all aspects of our cooperation with the United States,” Medvedev said. Reporting by Polina Nikolskaya and Vladimir Soldatkin Editing by Jack Stubbs",
