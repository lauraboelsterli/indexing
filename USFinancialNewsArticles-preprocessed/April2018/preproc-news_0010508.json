    "text": "Denver center Nikola Jokic scored 30 points on 11-for-17 shooting to power the Nuggets to a 107-104 victory over the Indiana Pacers at the Pepsi Center on Tuesday night.\nThe Nuggets, a half-game behind New Orleans for the final playoff spot, have won three in a row. The Pacers, who saw a five-game winning streak end, are fifth in Eastern Conference and 1 1/2 games behind Philadelphia.\nJokic chipped in with six rebounds and seven assists. Will Barton added 24 points and 10 rebounds for Denver.\nVictor Oladipo scored 15 of his 25 points in fourth quarter. Oladipo added four steals and seven assists, and Domantas Sabonis added 14 points off the bench.\nThe Nuggets have won eight consecutive games against Indiana in Denver. The Nuggets also won last season’s home game in London.\nThaddeus Young sank two free throws to cut the Nuggets’ lead to 91-89. Jamal Murray followed with a 3-pointer to start an 11-0 spurt to give the Nuggets a 100-89 edge. The closest the Pacers got was the final score when Darren Collison, who finished with 11 points, sank a 3-pointer at the buzzer.\nThe Pacers shot 48 percent and the Nuggets 46 percent.\nMurray sank a 14-foot jumper at the buzzer to give the Nuggets a 49-46 halftime lead.\nThe Nuggets opened the third quarter with an 11-0 run, starting with three 3-pointers, to grab a 60-46 advantage. Two of the 3s were by Wilson Chandler. The Pacers answered with a 10-0 spurt, but it was short-lived. Denver came back with its own 9-0 run to make it 70-56. Indiana narrowed the gap to 77-74 after three quarters.\nThe Pacers shot 46.3 percent in the opening half while the Nuggets made 41.2 percent. Denver had a 26-21 rebounding edge and the Nuggets had nine offensive rebounds. Indiana had eight turnovers, three more than Denver.\nThe Nuggets led 27-26 after one quarter.
