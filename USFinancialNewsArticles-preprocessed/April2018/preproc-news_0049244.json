    "text": "MOUNT AIRY, N.C., April 23, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Insteel Industries, Inc. (NasdaqGS: IIIN) today announced financial results for its second quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nSecond Quarter 2018 Results\nNet earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 decreased to $5.9 million, or $0.31 per share, from $7.4 million, or $0.39 per share, in the same period a year ago. Insteel's second-quarter results were unfavorably impacted by narrower spreads between selling prices and raw material costs partially offset by higher shipments and a lower effective tax rate relative to the prior year quarter.\nNet sales increased 6.2% to $107.4 million from $101.2 million in the prior year quarter driven by a 2.4% increase in shipments and a 3.7% increase in average selling prices. Shipments increased 6.8% sequentially from the first quarter of fiscal 2018 while average selling prices increased 2.9%. Gross margin narrowed 370 basis points to 14.4% from 18.1% in the prior year quarter due to the reduction in spreads. Insteel's effective tax rate decreased to 24.7% from 33.9% in the prior year quarter reflecting the reduction in the corporate tax rate under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nCash flow from operations decreased to $9.7 million from $13.7 million in the prior year quarter primarily due to the relative changes in net working capital and the decrease in earnings. Net working capital used $0.3 million of cash while providing $3.2 million in the prior year quarter.\nSix Month 2018 Results\nNet earnings for the first six months of fiscal 2018 increased to $14.0 million, or $0.73 per share, from $11.9 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, in the same period a year ago. Insteel's earnings for the current year period benefited from a $3.7 million, or $0.19 per share gain on the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities related to the impact of the new tax law. Net sales increased 5.2% to $205.2 million from $195.0 million in the prior year period driven by a 1.8% increase in shipments and a 3.3% increase in average selling prices. Gross margin narrowed 280 basis points to 13.2% from 16.0% due to the reduction in spreads. Excluding the deferred tax gain, Insteel's effective tax rate decreased to 24.7% from 33.8% in the prior year period.\nCash flow from operations increased to $24.5 million from $17.6 million in the prior year period primarily due to the relative changes in net working capital and the increase in earnings. Net working capital provided $4.3 million of cash while using $1.4 million in the prior year period.\nCapital Allocation and Liquidity\nCapital expenditures for the first six months of fiscal 2018 decreased to $9.3 million from $10.7 million in the prior year period. Capital outlays for fiscal 2018 are expected to total up to $21.0 million largely related to additional investments in engineered structural mesh (\"ESM\") manufacturing capabilities, the purchase of the leased Houston facility and further upgrades of production technology and information systems.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2018, Insteel returned $20.2 million of capital to shareholders through the payment of a special cash dividend of $1.00 per share and two regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.03 per share, marking the third consecutive year in which a special dividend of at least $1.00 per share has been paid. Insteel ended the quarter debt-free with $23.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, and no borrowings outstanding on its $100.0 million revolving credit facility.\nOutlook\n\"As we move into the second half of fiscal 2018, we expect improved business conditions driven by the usual seasonal pickup in demand together with continued growth in the construction sector,\" commented H.O. Woltz III, Insteel's president and CEO. \"We believe the infrastructure-related portion of our business will benefit from the funding increases provided for in the recently passed federal omnibus spending bill together with state and local initiatives. The outlook for private nonresidential construction remains positive as well based on most recent leading indicators and industry forecasts, with the potential for additional investment spurred by the new tax law.\"\nConference Call\nInsteel will hold a conference call at 10:00 a.m. ET today to discuss its second quarter financial results. A live webcast of this call can be accessed on Insteel's website at https://insteelgcs.gcs-web.com/ and will be archived for replay until the next quarterly conference call.\nAbout Insteel\nInsteel is the nation's largest manufacturer of steel wire reinforcing products for concrete construction applications.
