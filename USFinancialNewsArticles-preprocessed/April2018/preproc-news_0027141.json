    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - U.S., British and French air strikes on Syria are a violation of international law and are likely meant to prevent investigators from the global chemical weapons watchdog from doing their work, a senior Russian lawmaker was Quote: d by Interfax as saying on Saturday.\nThe chairman of the international affairs committee of Russia’s upper house of parliament, Konstantin Kosachev, described the air strikes as a groundless attack on a sovereign government, Interfax said.\n“It’s also highly likely an attempt to create complications for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons mission which was just starting its work in Syria’s Douma, or an attempt to completely derail it,” Kosachev was Quote: d as saying.\nNone of the air strikes hit zones where Russian air defense systems protect the Russian bases of Tartus and Hmeimim, Russian news agencies cited the Ministry of Defence as saying.\nReporting by Polina Ivanova; Editing by Nick Tattersall\n ",
