    "text": "United States: U.S. brings new charges in college basketball corruption case April 11th, 2018 Americas \nFederal prosecutors in New York on Tuesday expanded a corruption case into college basketball, accusing an Adidas AG executive of taking part in a scheme to bribe high school players to attend the University of Kansas and North Carolina State University, which are sponsored by the apparel maker. \nThe executive, James Gatto, was arrested in September, and was charged in an earlier indictment with scheming to bribe students to attend the Adidas-sponsored University of Louisville and University of Miami. The charges relating to the two additional universities came in a superseding indictment unsealed on Thursday in Manhattan federal court. \n  reuters.com",
