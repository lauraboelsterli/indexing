    "text": "April 27, 2018 / 4:26 PM / Updated 6 minutes ago UK police investigating possible terrorism motive in Birmingham car incident Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - Police said they were investigating whether an incident outside a mosque in Birmingham on Friday in which two men in their 20s were hit by a car was terrorism-related.\nOne of the men was described as having a head injury, and the other as walking wounded, West Midlands Police said in a statement. The car failed to stop after the incident.\n“At this time we have not ruled in or out the potential that this could be terror-related but we’re keeping an open mind until we have investigated further,” said Detective Inspector Greg Evans.\n“The investigation is at an early stage and we’re still trying to establish exactly what has happened,” he added.\nThe incident happened in the Aston area of the city on Friday afternoon.
