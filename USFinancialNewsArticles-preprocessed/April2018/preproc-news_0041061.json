ZTE uses U.S. chips in many of its smartphones. \nThe ZTE case had “triggered a heated debate” in China about advanced technology, Xinhua said in a separate report on Saturday, adding mastering high-end technologies such as chips was “key” to becoming a strong nation. \nLuo Wen, China’s deputy industry minister, said while China had made progress in advance manufacturing in areas like electric vehicles and aviation, it was still facing challenges due to a lack of top talent and global scale, Xinhua said. \n“Our advanced manufacturing development faces the risk of being boxed in at the low-end,” Xinhua reported, citing Luo.
