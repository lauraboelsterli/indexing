    "text": "BERLIN, April 26 (Reuters) - The mood among German consumers fell heading into May, a survey showed on Thursday, amid fears that a possible confrontation between the West and Russia in Syria and protectionist U.S. trade policies could hurt the economy. The consumer sentiment indicator, published by the GfK institute and based on a survey of around 2,000 Germans, fell to 10.8 going into May from 10.9 a month earlier. The reading was in line with forecasts from a Reuters poll. \"The escalation of the Syrian crisis and the protectionist trade policies of the United States are worrying consumers and could now also affect Germany's previously excellent economic prospects,\" GfK researcher Rolf Buerkl said in a statement. \"This development has also been exacerbated by major fluctuations in the stock markets, which also indicate an emerging insecurity among market participants and more turbulent times ahead,\" Buerkl said. Both economic and income expectations fell, the survey showed. But propensity to buy rose to a three-month high, good news for an economy that has depended on consumption for growth. The economy has grown for the past nine years. Low interest rates, record-high employment and rising real wages are all supporting consumption. \"Consumer mood is still very high. Consumers are still willing to open their wallets and spend. Firstly, there is little fear of job losses due to the excellent employment situation,\" Buerkl said. \"This supports planning security, which should primarily lead to greater spending, particularly because the period of low interest rates in the euro area will continue, making saving an unattractive alternative. Moderate price development will also support consumer mood.\" The dip in the mood among consumers is shared by other sentiment surveys. Both the Ifo institute's business morale indicator and the ZEW investor sentiment survey fell this month on weaker economic data in the first quarter. MAY 18 APRIL 18 MAY 17 Consumer climate 10.8 10.9 10.2 Consumer climate components APRIL 18 MARCH 18 APRIL 17 - willingness to buy 60.0 59.1 60.2 - income expectations 53.5 54.9 57.5 - business cycle expectations 37.4 45.9 30.3 NOTE - The consumer climate indicator forecasts the development of real private consumption in the following month. An indicator reading above zero signals year-on-year growth in private consumption. A value below zero indicates a drop compared with the same period a year ago. According to GfK, a one-point change in the indicator corresponds to a year-on-year change of 0.1 percent in private consumption. \"Willingness to buy\" represents the balance between positive and negative responses to the question: \"Do you think now is a good time to buy major items?\" The income expectations sub-index reflects expectations about household finances in the coming 12 months. The additional business cycle expectations index reflects the assessment of those questioned about the general economic situation in the next 12 months.
