(NASDAQ: ALXN) today announced financial results for 2018. Total revenues in the first quarter were $930.9 million, a 7 percent increase compared to the same period in 2017. First quarter 2017 revenues included a benefit of $49.2 million due to both the recognition of deferred revenue and timing of orders from certain non-U.S. markets that access Alexion's products through a tender process. The benefit of foreign currency on total revenues year-over-year was 2 percent or $13.7 million, net of hedging activities. On a GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share (EPS) in the quarter was $1.11 per share, a 48 percent increase versus the prior year. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for 2018 was $1.68 per share, a 22 percent increase versus the prior year.\n\"In 2018 we had strong momentum in our complement and metabolic portfolios. We continue to see robust underlying growth of Soliris and I am particularly pleased with the U.S. launch in patients with gMG. In addition, Strensiq remains a key driver of growth as we continue to serve new patients with HPP,\" said Ludwig Hantson, Chief Executive Officer of Alexion. \"Along with growing our in-line business, we announced positive topline results from both the ALXN1210 Phase 3 PNH Naive and Switch studies, and executed on our disciplined business development plan with the anticipated acquisition of Wilson Therapeutics to begin to rebuild the clinical pipeline. We are delivering on our 2018 objectives to drive sustainable long-term growth and I look forward to providing updates on our progress throughout the year.\"\nALXN1210 Phase 3 Switch Study Results\nAlexion is also announcing positive topline results of a Phase 3 study of ALXN1210, the Company’s investigational long-acting C5 complement inhibitor, which show that patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) can be effectively and safely switched from treatment with Soliris® (eculizumab) every two weeks to treatment with ALXN1210 every eight weeks. The study demonstrated non-inferiority of ALXN1210 to Soliris® in patients with PNH who had been stable on Soliris® based on the primary endpoint of change in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, a direct marker of complement-mediated hemolysis in PNH. The study also demonstrated non-inferiority on all four key secondary endpoints: the proportion of patients with breakthrough hemolysis, the change from baseline in quality of life as assessed via the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue Scale, the proportion of patients avoiding transfusion, and the proportion of patients with stabilized hemoglobin levels. In addition, numeric results for all five endpoints favored ALXN1210. Notably, no patients treated with ALXN1210 experienced breakthrough hemolysis compared to five patients treated with Soliris®.\nALXN1210 was generally well tolerated with a safety profile that is consistent with that seen for Soliris®. The most frequently observed adverse events were headache and upper respiratory infection. The most frequently observed serious adverse events were pyrexia, which occurred in three Soliris® patients, and hemolysis, which occurred in two Soliris® patients. No patient withdrew from the study due to adverse events. No treatment-emergent anti-drug antibody was observed for ALXN1210; one was observed for Soliris®. No neutralizing antibodies and no apparent effects on efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, or pharmacodynamics were detected. There were no cases of meningococcal infection observed in either the ALXN1210 or Soliris® arms. Meningococcal infections are a known risk with terminal complement inhibition, and specific risk-mitigation plans have been in place for ten years for Soliris® to minimize the risk for patients.\nDetailed results from this Phase 3 study will be presented at a future medical congress.\n“Once again ALXN1210 met the high bar set by Soliris in a second, large Phase 3 study. Importantly, we now have robust data that patients with PNH can effectively and safely transition from Soliris to ALXN1210,” said John Orloff, M.D., Executive Vice President and Head of Research & Development at Alexion. “We are very pleased that the totality of the Phase 3 PNH data in more than 440 patients, which included patients who had never received a complement inhibitor and patients who were stable on Soliris and switched to ALXN1210, shows numeric results favoring ALXN1210 across all primary and key secondary endpoints, including breakthrough hemolysis. We believe that the differentiated profile of ALXN1210 could be a meaningful improvement for patients and clinicians and look forward to moving rapidly to global regulatory filings in the U.S. and EU in mid-2018, followed by Japan later in the year.”\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights\nSoliris® (eculizumab) net product sales were $800.1 million, compared to $783.5 million in 2017, representing a 2 percent increase. Soliris® volume increased 2 percent year-over-year. Strensiq® (asfotase alfa) net product sales were $110.7 million, compared to $73.6 million in 2017, representing a 50 percent increase. Strensiq® volume increased 58 percent year-over-year. Kanuma® (sebelipase alfa) net product sales were $19.6 million, compared to $12.0 million in 2017, representing a 63 percent increase. Kanuma® volume increased 58 percent year-over-year. GAAP cost of sales was $91.6 million, compared to $69.0 million in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP cost of sales was $83.0 million, compared to $64.5 million in the same quarter last year. GAAP R&D expense was $176.6 million, compared to $219.5 million in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $161.6 million, compared to $194.4 million in the same quarter last year. GAAP SG&A expense was $257.1 million, compared to $261.8 million in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $220.4 million, compared to $226.1 million in the same quarter last year. GAAP income tax expense was $102.5 million, compared to $23.9 million in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP income tax expense was $68.6 million, compared to $50.8 million in the same quarter last year. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.11 per share, compared to $0.75 per share in the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.68 per share, compared to $1.38 per share in 2017.\nResearch and Development\nALXN1210- Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH): In the pivotal Phase 3 study of ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks, ALXN1210 achieved non-inferiority to Soliris® in complement inhibitor treatment-naive patients with PNH based on the co-primary endpoints of transfusion avoidance and normalization of LDH levels. The study also demonstrated non-inferiority on all four key secondary endpoints. In addition, ALXN1210 achieved non-inferiority on the primary and all four key secondary endpoints in the Phase 3 PNH Switch study of ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks compared to patients currently treated with Soliris®. Alexion plans to file for regulatory approval for ALXN1210 in patients with PNH in the U.S. and EU in mid-2018, followed by Japan later in the year.\nAlexion is enrolling pediatric PNH patients in a Phase 3 trial of ALXN1210; this study includes patients who have never received treatment with a complement inhibitor and those who enter the study stabilized on Soliris®. ALXN1210- Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS): Enrollment and dosing are ongoing in a Phase 3 trial with ALXN1210 administered intravenously every eight weeks in complement inhibitor treatment-naive adolescent and adult patients with aHUS. Enrollment is expected to be complete in the second quarter of 2018 and Alexion expects to report data from this study in the fourth quarter of 2018. Enrollment and dosing are also ongoing in a Phase 3 trial of ALXN1210 in pediatric patients with aHUS. ALXN1210- Subcutaneous: In late 2018 Alexion plans to initiate a single, PK-based Phase 3 study of ALXN1210 delivered subcutaneously once per week to support registration in PNH and aHUS. The Company also plans to use Halozyme's ENHANZE ® drug-delivery technology to develop a next-generation subcutaneous formulation of ALXN1210 to potentially further extend the dosing interval to once every two weeks or once per month. Soliris® (eculizumab)- Relapsing Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD): Enrollment is complete in the PREVENT study, a single, multinational, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial of Soliris® in patients with NMOSD. Alexion expects to report data by the end of 2018.\nTender Offer for Wilson Therapeutics\nOn April 11, 2018 Alexion announced that the Company made a recommended public cash offer to the shareholders of Wilson Therapeutics to acquire all outstanding shares in Wilson Therapeutics. Wilson Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company, based in Stockholm, Sweden, that develops novel therapies for patients with rare copper-mediated disorders. Wilson Therapeutics’ product, WTX101, is in Phase 3 development as a treatment for Wilson disease, a rare genetic disorder with devastating hepatic and neurological consequences for patients. WTX101 is a first-in-class oral copper-binding agent with a unique mechanism of action and ability to access and bind copper from serum and promote its removal from the liver.\nThe tender offer is expected to complete and the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.\n2018 Financial Guidance\nAlexion is increasing its revenue guidance, lowering its GAAP EPS guidance and increasing its non-GAAP EPS guidance. Full guidance updates are outlined below.\nPrevious Updated Total revenues $3,850 to $3,950 million $3,925 to $3,985 million Soliris revenues\n$3,325 to $3,400 million $3,380 to $3,420 million Metabolic revenues $525 to $550 million $545 to $565 million R&D (% total revenues) GAAP 20% to 22% 41% to 44% Non-GAAP 18% to 20% 18% to 20% SG&A (% total revenues) GAAP 26% to 28% 26% to 28% Non-GAAP 23% to 24% 23% to 24% Operating margin GAAP 31% to 34% 8% to 11% Non-GAAP 48% to 49% 48% to 49% Earnings per share GAAP $4.35 to $4.75 $1.35 to $1.75 Non-GAAP $6.60 to $6.80 $6.75 to $6.90 2018 financial guidance assumes the following:\nA foreign currency benefit, net of hedging activities, of $45 million to $55 million Unfavorable Soliris® revenue impact of $90 million to $110 million from ALXN1210 and other clinical trial recruitment versus prior year GAAP effective tax rate of 16 to 17 percent; non-GAAP effective tax rate of 15 to 16 percent GAAP guidance reflects the preliminary financial impact of the announced tender offer for Wilson Therapeutics, which Alexion expects to account for as an asset acquisition and recognize in research and development expenses during the second quarter of 2018. In addition, non-GAAP financial guidance includes the preliminary impact of operating expenses for Wilson Therapeutics.\nAlexion’s financial guidance is based on current foreign exchange rates net of hedging activities and does not include the effect of business combinations, license and collaboration agreements, asset acquisitions, intangible asset impairments, changes in fair value of contingent consideration or restructuring and related activity outside of the previously announced activities that may occur after the day prior to the date of this press release.\nAlexion expects to incur additional restructuring and related expenses of approximately $15 million to $80 million related to the Company's 2017 restructuring activities. As the Company continues to execute its strategic business plan and global footprint, it may incur restructuring expenses in 2018 that are materially different from the current estimate.\nConference Call/Webcast Information:\nAlexion will host a conference call/audio webcast to discuss the first quarter 2018 results today at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. To participate in the call, dial 888-394-8218 (USA) or 323-701-0225 (International), passcode 1013806 shortly before 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. A replay of the call will be available for a limited period following the call. The replay number is 888-203-1112 (USA) or 719-457-0820 (International), passcode 1013806. The audio webcast can be accessed on the Investor page of Alexion’s website at: http://ir.alexion.com .\nAbout the ALXN1210 PNH Switch Study\nThis Phase 3, open-label, randomized, active-controlled, multicenter study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ALXN1210 versus Soliris® administered by intravenous (IV) infusion in 195 adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) with confirmed diagnosis of PNH and LDH levels ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) who had been treated with Soliris® for at least the past 6 months. ALXN1210 was administered every 8 weeks, whereas Soliris® was administered every 2 weeks. The 26-week treatment period is followed by an extension period, in which all patients will receive ALXN1210 every 8 weeks for up to 2 years.\nThe primary endpoint investigated hemolysis as directly measured by the percentage change of LDH levels from Baseline to Day 183. Key secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with breakthrough hemolysis, the change in quality of life assessed via the FACIT-Fatigue Scale from Baseline to Day 183, transfusion avoidance from Baseline to Day 183, and the proportion of patients with stabilized hemoglobin levels from Baseline to Day 183. Breakthrough hemolysis was defined as at least one new or worsening symptom or sign of intravascular hemolysis (fatigue, hemoglobinuria, abdominal pain, shortness of breath [dyspnea], anemia [hemoglobin < 10 g/dL], major adverse vascular event [MAVE, including thrombosis], dysphagia, or erectile dysfunction) in the presence of elevated LDH ≥ 2 × ULN. Transfusion avoidance was defined as the proportion of patients who remain transfusion-free and do not require a transfusion as per protocol-specified guidelines. A stabilized hemoglobin level was defined as avoidance of a ≥ 2 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin level from baseline in the absence of transfusion.\nAbout Alexion\nAlexion is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on serving patients and families affected by rare diseases through the innovation, development and commercialization of life-changing therapies.

The adjusted deferred revenue balance, as of January 1, 2018, was $5.5 million. We recognized this amount in revenue during the three-months ended March 31, 2018.\n(2) Prior year amounts may have been adjusted to conform to current year rounding presentation.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180426005430/en/\nAlexion Contacts:\nMedia\nKim Diamond, 475-230-3775\nExecutive Director, Corporate Communications\nor\nInvestors\nSusan Altschuller, Ph.D., 475-230-3534\nVice President, Investor Relations\nSource: Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",
