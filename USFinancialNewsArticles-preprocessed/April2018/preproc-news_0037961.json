    "text": "April 18 (Reuters) - A California agency for occupational safety said on Wednesday it has initiated an open inspection on Tesla Inc but did not disclose the details of the probe.\nErika Monterroza, spokesperson for California Occupational Safety and Health Administration, said, \"Cal/OSHA currently has an open inspection at Tesla.\"\nCal/OSHA's inspections typically include a review of the employer's Log 300, Monterroza said. Log 300 is a log of work-related injuries and illnesses.\nThe agency said it will also review to ensure that serious injuries are reported directly to Cal/OSHA within eight hours as required by law.\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
