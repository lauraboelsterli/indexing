(“Captor” or the “Company”) (CSE:CPTR) (FRANKFURT:NMV) announced today that it entered into a non-binding term sheet with leading California cannabis company, Growth Network Holdings, Inc. (“Growth Network”) to acquire 30 per cent of its issued and outstanding equity securities for a purchase price of US$14,632,500 (the “Investment”). In accordance with the term sheet, Captor will also be granted an option exercisable for up to 12 months after closing to acquire the remaining issued and outstanding equity securities of Growth Network for USD$34,142,500.\nGrowth Network is a seed to sale cannabis company focusing on cultivation, extraction, distribution and retail sales.

The cannabis business park, scheduled to break ground in the second quarter of 2018, will also include an extraction and manufacturing facility, a packaging and distribution centre, and an independent testing laboratory. Growth Network also owns and operates a licensed cultivation facility in Los Angeles with 45,000 square feet of indoor cultivation space.\nGrowth Network also operates two retail dispensaries in the Los Angeles area, including the upscale neighbourhood of Culver City, which is home to corporate offices for Facebook and Sony amongst others.

The option shall be exercisable for 12 months and may be extended for a further 12 months if Growth Network has not received all of its remaining cultivation licenses and permits.\nConcurrent with the completion of the Share Purchase and the Equity Contribution, Captor will enter into a shareholder agreement with John Jezzini pursuant to which, among other things, Captor will agree to provide debt financing of up to USD$27,875,000 to Growth Network to fund its cultivation and retail dispensary operations.
