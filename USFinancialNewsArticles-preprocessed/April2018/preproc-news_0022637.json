REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer \nThe major Middle East airline is pursuing a company-wide review and has cut several other routes already as it seeks to restore profitability. \nEtihad is stopping flights to Edinburgh and Perth, Australia, as part “of several adjustments that we are making to our network in 2018 in order to improve system profitability”, said an Etihad spokesman in a statement on Wednesday. \nState-owned Etihad launched the strategy review in 2016, the financial year when it suffered a $1.87 billion (£1.3 billion) loss that it largely blamed on aircraft impairments and investments in troubled European airlines. \nFew details about the review have been made public. \nThe Gulf airline continues to fly to London, Heathrow and Manchester in the United Kingdom, and Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne in Australia. \nThe airline, along with Emirates and Qatar Airways which make up the three major Middle East airlines, has relied on building a diverse, global network to carry millions of passengers a year. \nMost of their passengers do not start or end their journey at their respective hubs in the Gulf. \nBritain’s top defence buyer Tony Douglas joined Etihad as its new group chief executive this year, replacing long-serving CEO James Hogan, who departed in 2017.
