    "text": "BRUSSELS, April 10 (Reuters) - EU investigators carried out unannounced inspections on Tuesday at the offices of firms linked to the broadcasting of sports events in several member states over concerns they may have violated EU antitrust rules, the European Commission said.\nIt said the Commission officials were accompanied by their counterparts from the relevant national competition authorities.\n“Officials carried out unannounced inspections in several Member States at the premises of companies active in the distribution of media rights and related rights pertaining to various sports events and/or their broadcasting,” the Commission said in a statement.\nEarlier on Tuesday a unit of Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox Inc said it was cooperating with an inspection by the EU after the Telegraph newspaper reported that officials had raided its offices in London.
