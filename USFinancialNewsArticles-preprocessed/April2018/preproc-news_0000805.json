The three accolades came from The Stevie Awards for Sales and Customer Service, ROI Influencers Power List for 2018 and the Department of Defense’s Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve.\nStevie Awards\niCIMS’ commitment to offering an exceptional customer experience has led to recognition by the Stevie Awards for Sales & Customer Service for the seventh consecutive year. The company was recognized in the customer service department of the year category among computer software companies with 100 or more employees. iCIMS was recognized for its customer service teams’ devotion to achieving growth and progress. Most notably, in 2017 the teams focused on making improvements to the areas of web support, call support, training and customer self-service initiatives.\n“Not many companies can point to seven consecutive years of recognition for outstanding customer service,” said Adam Feigenbaum, iCIMS Chief Customer Officer. “These awards are important because they represent the sincere passion and dedication iCIMS employees put forth to drive positive outcomes for our customers.”\nROI Influencers\nColin Day, iCIMS CEO, was named to the inaugural ROI Influencers Power List for 2018 as one of the most influential people in New Jersey-based companies. Day was one of six in the state selected in the technology category including the CEOs and presidents of Audible, Bell Labs, Marketsmith Inc., NJ Tech Council and NJ Innovation Institute.\nThe top executives named to the list are devoted to their industry’s growth within the state. iCIMS was recognized by ROI Editor Tom Bergeron as an “example of how the state can create, nurture and grow a tech brand.”\nDepartment of Defense\niCIMS’ Manager of Integration Services, Gina McCullough, received an award from the Department of Defense’s Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR). Three representatives from the Monmouth County division of the ESGR visited iCIMS’ headquarters at Bell Works in Holmdel, NJ to present McCullough with the Patriot Award on February 27, 2018.\nMcCullough received the award for demonstrating outstanding support and commitment to one of her team members who is currently deployed to serve our nation. ESGR works with employers to support employees’ military service and to ensure that reservists and National Guard members can return to their jobs from active duty.\nEarlier this year iCIMS was also named a finalist in NJBIZ’s Best Places to Work in NJ awards program for the seventh consecutive year.\nClick here to learn more about other awards received by iCIMS.\nAbout iCIMS, Inc.:\niCIMS is the leading provider of talent acquisition solutions that help businesses win the war for top talent. iCIMS empowers companies to manage their entire hiring process within the industry’s most robust Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).
