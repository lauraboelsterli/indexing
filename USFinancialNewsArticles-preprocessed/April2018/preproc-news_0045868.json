    "text": "GAHANNA, Ohio, Heartland BancCorp (“the company,” and “the bank”) (OTCQB:HLAN), today reported net income increased 37.4% to $2.5 million, or $1.52 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $1.8 million, or $1.13 per diluted share, in the first quarter a year ago. In the preceding quarter, following a one-time write-down of its deferred tax assets and liabilities, which resulted in an additional tax expense of $541,000, or $0.29 per diluted share, net income was $2.1 million, or $1.25 per diluted share.\nThe company also announced its board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.4731 per share. The dividend will be payable July 10, 2018, to shareholders of record as of June 25, 2018.\n“Our first quarter financial results were highlighted by strong loan and core deposit growth and solid net interest income, contributing to record earnings for the quarter,” stated G. Scott McComb, Chairman, President and CEO. “The continued focus on delivering value to our clients combined with the strength of the economy in the greater Columbus marketplace continues to sustain and build our community banking franchise. With strong on-going demand for our high-service approach, our focus remains on serving the business owners and retail clients that understand relationships matter.”\nFirst Quarter Financial Highlights (at or for the period ended March 31, 2018)\nNet income increased 37.4% to $2.5 million, compared to $1.8 million, in the first quarter of 2017. Pre-tax income increased 22.2% to $3.1 million, compared to $2.5 million in the first quarter of 2017. Net interest margin was 3.93% compared to 4.03% in the preceding quarter and 3.94% in the first quarter a year ago. Annualized return on average assets was 1.11%. Annualized return on average equity was 13.04%. Total assets increased 14.6% to $937.6 million, compared to $818.4 million a year earlier. Net loans increased 15.4% to $733.3 million from a year ago. Total deposits increased 15.6% to $814.2 million from a year ago. Tangible book value per share was $47.97 per share compared to $48.51 three months earlier and $45.50 per share one year earlier. Declared quarterly cash dividend of $0.4731 per share, which represents a 2.15% yield based on the March 31, 2018, stock price ($88.05).\nBalance Sheet Review\n“Net loans increased $29.8 million during the quarter and increased 15.4% year over year, with solid production in targeted loan types, including commercial real estate and consumer residential real estate loans,” said McComb. “We see significant potential for growth in our loan origination pipelines due to our investment in people, systems and a strong cohesive management team, all of which have helped us grow these business segments.”\nNet loans were $733.3 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $635.7 million at March 31, 2017 and increased 4.2% compared to $703.5 million at December 31, 2017.\nTotal deposits increased 15.6% to $814.2 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $704.2 million a year earlier and increased 4.8% compared to $776.8 million three months earlier. Noninterest bearing demand deposit accounts represented 25.6%; savings, NOW and money market accounts represented 38.3%; and CDs comprised 36.1% of the total deposit portfolio, at March 31, 2018.\nHeartland’s total assets increased 14.6% to $937.6 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $818.4 million a year earlier and shareholders’ equity increased 7.9% to $78.4 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $72.6 million one year ago. At quarter end, Heartland’s tangible book value increased 5.4% to $47.97 per share compared to $45.50 per share one year earlier.\nOperating Results\nHeartland’s net interest income before the provision for loan loss increased 15.8% to $8.2 million in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $7.1 million in the first quarter a year ago, but declined modestly compared to $8.3 million in the preceding quarter.\n“Our net interest margin contracted ten basis points compared to the preceding quarter, largely due to the reduced benefit of tax exempt municipal bonds resulting from lower federal tax rates and higher levels of short-term borrowings in the first quarter 2018,” said McComb. Heartland’s net interest margin was 3.93% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 4.03% in the preceding quarter and 3.94% in the first quarter a year ago.\nTotal revenues (net interest income before the provision for loan losses, plus noninterest income) increased 18.5% to $9.5 million in the first quarter, compared to $8.0 million in the first quarter a year ago, and were unchanged when compared to the preceding quarter.\nNoninterest income increased 39.1% to $1.3 million in the first quarter, compared to $935,000 in the first quarter a year ago, and increased 12.6% when compared to $1.2 million in the preceding quarter. The net gains and commissions on loan sales and servicing was $547,000 in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $220,000 in the preceding quarter and $161,000 in the year ago quarter. “Noninterest income has been a focus and will continue to be on the forefront for us aiding to income, and lessening the dependence on the NIM over time, allowing us to be attractive for middle market companies to partner with,” said McComb.\nHeartland’s first quarter noninterest expenses were $6.1 million, compared to $5.7 million in the preceding quarter and $5.2 million in the first quarter a year ago. The efficiency ratio for the first quarter of 2018 was 63.36%, compared to 59.86% for the preceding quarter and 64.64% in the first quarter of 2017.\nCredit Quality\nNonaccrual loans increased to $6.8 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $3.6 million a year earlier and $1.9 million three months earlier. The increase was primarily due to one lending relationship that was placed on nonaccrual during the current quarter. There were $62,000 in loans past due 90 days and still accruing at March 31, 2018, compared to no loans past due at December 31, 2017, and $271,000 at the end of the first quarter a year ago.\nPerforming restructured loans that were not included in nonaccrual loans at March 31, 2018, were $1.7 million, the same as in the preceding quarter and year ago quarter. Borrowers who are in financial difficulty and who have been granted concessions that may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, or payment alterations are categorized as restructured loans.\nThere was no other real estate owned (OREO) and other non-performing assets on the books at March 31, 2018, compared to $40,000 at December 31, 2017 and $400,000 at March 31, 2017.\nNon-performing assets (NPAs), consisting of non-performing loans, OREO, and loans delinquent 90 days or more, were $6.9 million, or 0.74% of assets, at March 31, 2018, compared to $1.9 million, or 0.21% of assets, three months earlier, and $4.3 million, or 0.53% of assets, a year ago.\nHeartland’s first quarter provision for loan losses was $375,000 compared to $255,000, in the preceding quarter and $330,000 in the first quarter a year ago. The allowance for loan losses was $6.6 million, or 0.90% of total loans at March 31, 2018, compared to $6.2 million, or 0.88% of total loans at December 31, 2017, and $6.0 million, or 0.94% of total loans a year ago. As of March 31, 2018, the allowance for loan losses represented 97.2% of nonaccrual loans compared to 336.5% three months earlier, and 165.3% one year earlier. Net recoveries were $49,000 in the fourth quarter. This compares to net charge-offs of $377,000 in the preceding quarter and net charge-offs of $20,000 in the first quarter a year ago.\nAbout Heartland BancCorp\nHeartland BancCorp is a registered Ohio bank holding company and the parent of Heartland Bank, which operates 15 full-service banking offices.
