    "text": "President Donald Trump's longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen, brokered a deal to pay $1.6 million to a former Playboy model who said she was impregnated by Republican National Committee official Elliott Broidy, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to CNBC.\nThe sources also told CNBC that Cohen was paid $250,000 for negotiating and handling the deal.\nAttorneys for Cohen and representatives for the Republican National Committee, as well as lawyers for the former Playboy model, have not yet responded to CNBC's requests for comment. Representatives for Broidy declined to comment.\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the news of Broidy's payoff to the woman earlier Friday .\nCiting people familiar with the matter, the Journal reported that the 2017 deal prohibits the woman from discussing the relationship with Broidy, who worked as a deputy finance chairman of the GOP's committee. Broidy resigned from the committee shortly following the Journal's report. The committee's chairwoman accepted his resignation.\n\"I acknowledge I had a consensual relationship with a Playboy Playmate,\" Broidy said in a statement. \"At the end of our relationship, this woman shared with me that she was pregnant. She alone decided that she did not want to continue with the pregnancy and I offered to help her financially during this difficult period.\"\nStefanie Keenan | Getty Images Elliott Broidy Cohen also works for the committee as a national deputy finance chairman. Casino mogul Steve Wynn resigned as RNC national finance chair in February after the Journal reported that he had been accused of sexual misconduct. \nThe $1.6 million sum was scheduled to be paid to the woman in quarterly installments, beginning in December 2017 and parceled out over the course of two years, according to sources who declined to be named. Broidy still owes money under the deal, although it was unclear how much he still had to pay out.\nThe development is the latest example of Cohen negotiating nondisclosure agreements and payments to women who allegedly had affairs with his clients. Cohen and Trump are currently being sued by porn star Stormy Daniels, who seeks to void her own hush deal over an alleged dalliance with Trump for which she was paid $130,000.\nCohen is also in the sights of the FBI, who raided his office and residence on Monday and seized records and communications related to the deal with Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. The agents also sought documents regarding another woman who allegedly had an affair with Trump, Karen McDougal, who received $150,000 from the parent company of The National Enquirer.\nThe authorities reportedly seized documents and communications related to the now-infamous \"Access Hollywood\" tape containing audio of Trump boasting about sexual harassment.\nBroidy was a prominent supporter of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, and contributed to the then-candidate's fundraising efforts as vice chairman of the Trump Victory Fund, which combined state and national Republican committees.\nBroidy apologized to his family in his statement: \"It is unfortunate that this personal matter between two consenting adults is the subject of national discussion just because of Michael Cohen's involvement. Mr. Cohen reached out to me after being contacted by this woman's attorney, Keith Davidson. Although I had not previously hired Mr. Cohen, I retained Mr. Cohen after he informed me about his prior relationship with Mr. Davidson.\"",
