This distribution marks the initial distribution payable on the Series C Preferred Units.\nAbout Landmark Infrastructure Partners LP\nThe Partnership owns and manages a portfolio of real property interests and infrastructure assets that the Partnership leases to companies in the wireless communication, outdoor advertising and renewable power generation industries.\nNotice\nThis release serves as qualified notice to nominees as provided for under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b)(4) and (d).
