Millman was ahead 2-6 6-1 5-4 when play was suspended due to darkness.\nItaly’s Andreas Seppi, seeking his first title since 2012, fought past a determined Nikoloz Basilashvili 6-4 7-6(3) in another quarter-final earlier in the day.\n“I think I played a solid match. I was very focused,” Seppi said. “I played very well in the important moments.”\nThe world number 55 next meets compatriot Marco Cecchinato. The lucky loser advanced to the last four after upsetting seventh seeded Jan-Lennard Struff 5-7 6-4 6-2. Reporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru, editing by Pritha Sarkar",
