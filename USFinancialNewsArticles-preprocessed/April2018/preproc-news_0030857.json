    "text": "3 COMMENTS As a teenage engineering whiz, Kai Kloepfer was dubbed “the Mark Zuckerberg of guns” by venture capitalist Ron Conway for the handgun he invented with a fingerprint reader on the grip.\nThe now 21-year-old Mr. Kloepfer appears to be the only one moving forward—even as he majors in business and computer science at MIT. He made Forbes’ “30 Under 30” list, but struggled at first to get private investment for his company Biofire Technologies.\nLast year, Mr. Kloepfer secured funding from Mr. Conway and a few others. He is currently making hires and hopes to raise more money and ship and product in 12 to 18 months.\nMr. Conway remains optimistic about Mr. Kloepfer, if not the foundation, which raised $15,000 in 2015 and not much more since then.\n“We awarded our grants, we picked our horses,” he said.\nVenture capitalist Ron Conway remains optimistic about Mr. Kloepfer. Photo: Scott Olson/Getty Images Mr. Conway’s push also spurred companies making less-controversial gun-safety products like biometric locks, one of which has a product on the market.\nGavin de Becker, a gun owner whose Los Angeles-based security firm protects prominent public figures, put more than $100,000 into Biofire but lamented the state of the industry.\n“The very fact that we’re talking about one person instead of hundreds of people backed by corporations shows the ridiculousness of the national position,” said Mr. de Becker. “We’re a country literally built on technological creativity and the best we’ve been able to put forth is a kid in Colorado in his garage.”\nWrite to Zusha Elinson at zusha.elinson@wsj.com and Joe Palazzolo at joe.palazzolo@wsj.com",
