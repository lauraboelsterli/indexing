See the information on pages 8 through 10 for a reconciliation to their most\ndirectly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nCompleted Acquisition of Guggenheim Investments' ETF business\nOn April 6, the company completed its previously announced acquisition of Guggenheim Investments' exchange-traded funds (ETF) business, which consists of $38.1 billion of assets under management (at date of acquisition).\nThe acquisition strengthens Invesco's market-leading ETF capabilities as well as the firm's efforts to meet the needs of institutional and retail clients in the US and across the globe, which will contribute further to the growth and long-term success of the business. With this acquisition, Invesco's ETF assets under management total $211.8 billion globally (as of March 31, 2018).\nThe aggregate purchase price paid by Invesco upon completion of the transaction was $1.2 billion.\nAssets Under Management\nTotal assets under management (AUM) at March 31, 2018, were $934.2 billion (December 31, 2017: $937.6 billion), a decrease of $3.4 billion during the first quarter. Long-term net inflows were $0.3 billion and total net inflows were $0.3 billion for the first quarter.\nSummary of net flows (in billions)\nQ1-18\nQ4-17\nQ1-17\nActive\n($1.5)\n($2.3)\n($0.5)\nPassive\n1.8\n0.8\n2.1\nLong-term net flows (1)\n0.3\n(1.5)\n1.6\nNon-management fee earning AUM\n(0.4)\n1.6\n1.2\nInstitutional money market\n0.4\n(3.3)\n(8.1)\nTotal net flows\n$0.3\n($3.2)\n($5.3)\nAnnualized long-term organic growth rate (2)\n0.2\n%\n(0.8%)\n1.0\n%\n(1)\nIn 2018, in response to investor feedback, the company reverted to its historical presentation of long-term net flows, which excludes reinvested distributions. To enhance transparency, reinvested distributions will be shown in a separate line in the AUM tables. The fourth quarter 2017 has been reclassified to conform with the current presentation. For periods prior to the third quarter of 2017, reinvested distributions were included in market gains and losses.\n(2)\nAnnualized long-term organic growth rate is calculated using long-term net flows (annualized) divided by opening long-term AUM for the period. Long-term AUM excludes institutional money market and non-management fee earning AUM.\nNet market losses led to decreases of $12.2 billion in AUM during the first quarter, compared to net market gains of $14.9 billion in the fourth quarter. Reinvested distributions for the first quarter were $0.6 billion compared to $5.9 billion for the fourth quarter. Foreign exchange rate movements led to a $7.9 billion increase in AUM during the first quarter, compared to a $2.5 billion increase in the fourth quarter. Average AUM during the first quarter were $951.3 billion, compared to $930.3 billion for the fourth quarter, an increase of 2.3%. Further analysis is included in the supplementary schedules to this release.\nOperating Results\nThis section discusses the company's first quarter 2018 results, as compared to the fourth quarter 2017, and comments on significant items that have impacted the company's results as presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The company adopted required changes in revenue accounting rules as of January 1, 2018. The company's adoption methodology impacts only the 2018 period, and these impacts are quantified in the table below.\n(in millions)\nThree months\nended\nMarch 31,\n2018\nThree months\nended\nDecember 31,\n2017\nVariance\nIncreases/(dec\nreases) related\nto\nRevenue\nRecognition\nchanges\nVariance (Excluding impact of Revenue Recognition changes)\nOperating revenues:\nInvestment management fees\n$1,043.7\n$1,098.7\n($55.0)\n($53.8)\n($1.2)\nService and distribution fees\n246.1\n217.5\n28.6\n32.4\n(3.8)\nPerformance fees\n9.1\n43.0\n(33.9)\n—\n(33.9)\nOther\n56.9\n16.4\n40.5\n41.0\n(0.5)\nTotal operating revenues\n1,355.8\n1,375.6\n(19.8)\n19.6\n(39.4)\nOperating expenses:\nThird-party distribution, service and advisory\n419.1\n390.9\n28.2\n23.8\n4.4\nEmployee compensation\n390.4\n383.6\n6.8\n—\n6.8\nMarketing\n28.1\n40.7\n(12.6)\n—\n(12.6)\nProperty, office and technology\n102.2\n102.8\n(0.6)\n—\n(0.6)\nGeneral and administrative\n94.9\n115.0\n(20.1)\n(4.2)\n(15.9)\nTotal operating expenses\n1,034.7\n1,033.0\n1.7\n19.6\n(17.9)\nOperating income\n$321.1\n$342.6\n($21.5)\n$—\n($21.5)\nGross revenue yield on AUM (1)\n57.6 bps\n59.7 bps\n(2.1 bps)\n0.8 bps\n(2.9 bps)\nAdjusted Financial Measures (2)\nNet revenues\n$958.0\n$1,004.9\n($46.9)\n($4.2)\n($42.7)\nAdjusted operating income\n$357.3\n$397.5\n($40.2)\n$—\n($40.2)\nNet revenue yield on AUM\n40.3 bps\n43.2 bps\n(2.9 bps)\n(0.2 bps)\n(2.7 bps)\n(1)\nSee note (c) on page 15 for calculation of gross revenue yield on AUM.

See the information on pages 8 through 10 for a reconciliation to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures.\nOperating revenues decreased $19.8 million in the first quarter. The change in revenue recognition rules increased first quarter 2018 operating revenues by $19.6 million. Excluding the change in revenue accounting rules, operating revenues decreased $39.4 million. Foreign exchange rate changes increased first quarter operating revenues by $16.7 million compared to the fourth quarter.\nInvestment management fees decreased $55.0 million in the first quarter. The change in revenue recognition rules decreased first quarter 2018 investment management fees by $53.8 million. Excluding the change in revenue accounting rules, investment management fees decreased by $1.2 million. The decrease reflects two fewer days during the first quarter, offset by higher average AUM and the impact of foreign exchange. Foreign exchange rate changes increased first quarter investment management fees by $16.2 million compared to the fourth quarter.\nService and distribution fees increased $28.6 million in the first quarter. The change in revenue recognition rules increased first quarter 2018 service and distribution fees $32.4 million. Excluding the change in revenue accounting rules, service and distribution fees decreased by $3.8 million, reflecting lower day count.\nPerformance fees decreased $33.9 million compared to the fourth quarter. Performance fees recorded in the first quarter were primarily generated by our real estate, U.K. equity, and bank loan teams.\nOther revenues increased $40.5 million in the first quarter. The change in revenue recognition rules increased first quarter 2018 other revenues $41.0 million. Excluding the change in revenue accounting rules, other revenues decreased by $0.5 million.\nOperating expenses increased $1.7 million in the first quarter. The change in revenue recognition rules increased first quarter 2018 operating expenses $19.6 million. Excluding the change in revenue accounting rules, operating expenses decreased $17.9 million. Business optimization charges were $8.2 million in the first quarter, compared to $9.0 million in the fourth quarter. Total costs of these initiatives at completion are estimated to be up to $158 million, of which approximately $27 million related to a large-scale outsourcing project remains to be incurred through 2018. As of the end of the first quarter, this initiative has produced annualized run-rate expense savings of $45 million, and by completion in 2018, the annualized run-rate savings is expected to be up to $65 million. Foreign exchange rate changes increased first quarter operating expenses by $10.0 million when compared to the fourth quarter.\nThird-party distribution, service and advisory expenses increased $28.2 million. The change in revenue recognition rules increased third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses $23.8 million. Excluding the change in revenue accounting rules, third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses increased by $4.4 million. Foreign exchange rate changes increased first quarter third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses by $1.1 million when compared to the fourth quarter.\nEmployee compensation expenses increased by $6.8 million compared to the fourth quarter. The first quarter reflects a seasonal increase in payroll tax and employee benefit costs, partially offset by decreases in variable compensation costs. Staff severance costs related to business optimization were $4.3 million in the first quarter compared to $2.8 million in the fourth quarter. Foreign exchange rate changes increased first quarter employee compensation expenses by $5.4 million when compared to the fourth quarter.\nMarketing expenses decreased by $12.6 million compared to the fourth quarter, reflecting the seasonal decrease from fourth quarter client events and marketing campaigns.\nProperty, office and technology expenses decreased $0.6 million compared to the fourth quarter.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $20.1 million in the first quarter. The change in revenue recognition rules decreased general and administrative expenses $4.2 million. Excluding the change in revenue accounting rules, general and administrative expenses decreased by $15.9 million, due to decreased legal and regulatory costs, as well as lower irrecoverable taxes, travel costs and acquisition-related amortization expense as compared to the fourth quarter. Foreign exchange rate changes increased first quarter general and administrative expenses by $1.7 million when compared to the fourth quarter.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased $6.1 million compared to the fourth quarter primarily from increases in earnings from our real estate investments. Non-operating other income and expenses in the first quarter also included a $27.2 million net gain comprised of market-driven gains and losses of investments held by consolidated investment products (CIP) and net interest income of CIP (fourth quarter: $44.8 million gain).\nOther gains and losses, net was a loss in the first quarter of $5.4 million compared to a gain of $25.6 million in the fourth quarter. The components and variances are included in the table below:\nSummary of Other gains and losses, net (in millions)\nQ1-18\nQ4-17\nChange\nInvestment gains/(losses)\n($2.4)\n$12.0\n($14.4)\nMarket valuation gains/(losses) in deferred compensation plan investments\n(4.0)\n3.7\n(7.7)\nMarket valuation gains/(losses) on acquisition-related contingent consideration\n0.4\n7.4\n(7.0)\nOther gain/(loss) items\n0.6\n2.5\n(1.9)\n($5.4)\n$25.6\n($31.0)\nThe effective tax rate was a 20.5% charge for the first quarter, compared to a 5.8% tax benefit for the fourth quarter. The fourth quarter 2017 included a $130.7 million (33.9%) tax benefit related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities following the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"2017 Tax Act\") enacted in the United States. First quarter 2018 includes a 5.6% tax rate reduction as a result of lower Federal tax rates effective January 1, 2018.\nThe impact of the inclusion of non-controlling interests in CIP decreased our effective tax rate by 0.7% for the first quarter, compared to an increase of 0.2% for the fourth quarter.\nCapital Management\nAs of March 31, 2018, the company's cash and cash equivalents were $1,861.5 million, with long-term debt of $2,076.4 million. The credit facility balance was zero at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nAs previously announced, the company completed its acquisition of the Guggenheim Investments' ETF business on April 6, 2018, for a purchase price of $1.2 billion. To fund the purchase, the company borrowed approximately $835 million on its credit facility in early April 2018. The company plans to repay the amount borrowed over the course of 2018, returning leverage ratios to pre-acquisition levels, through the continued curtailment of open market share repurchases. As a result, the company has not repurchased common shares in the open market to date in 2018.\nDividends paid in the first quarter were $119.6 million. Today, the company is announcing a first quarter cash dividend of 30.0 cents. The dividend is payable on June 1, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 11, 2018, with an ex-dividend date of May 10, 2018.\nHeadcount\nAs of March 31, 2018, the company had 7,134 employees, compared to 7,030 employees as of December 31, 2017.\nInvesco is an independent investment management firm dedicated to delivering an investment experience that helps people get more out of life.

We believe the adjusted measures provide valuable insight into our ongoing operational performance and assist in comparisons to our competitors. These measures also assist management with the establishment of operational budgets and forecasts and assist the Board of Directors and management in determining incentive compensation decisions. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are operating revenues (and by calculation, gross revenue yield on AUM), operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Invesco Ltd., and diluted EPS.\nThe following are reconciliations of operating revenues, operating income (and by calculation, operating margin), and net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. (and by calculation, diluted EPS) on a U.S. GAAP basis to a non-GAAP basis of net revenues, adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), and adjusted net income attributable to Invesco Ltd. (and by calculation, adjusted diluted EPS). In addition, a reconciliation of adjusted operating expenses is provided below, together with reconciliations of the U.S. GAAP operating expense lines to provide further analysis of the non-GAAP adjustments. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any U.S. GAAP measures and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The tax effect of the reconciling items is based on the tax jurisdiction attributable to the transactions. These measures are described more fully in the company's Forms 10-K and 10-Q.

feedback, the company reverted to its historical presentation of long-term net flows, which excludes reinvested distributions. To enhance transparency, reinvested distributions will be shown in a separate line in the AUM tables. The fourth quarter 2017 has been reclassified to conform with the current presentation. For periods prior to the third quarter of 2017, reinvested distributions were included in market gains and losses.\n(b)\nNon-management fee earning AUM includes Invesco PowerShares QQQ, UIT and product leverage.\n(c)\nGross revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized total operating revenues divided by average AUM, excluding China joint venture (JV) AUM. For quarterly AUM, our share of the average AUM in the first quarter for our JVs in China was $9.8 billion (fourth quarter: $9.1 billion; first quarter 2017: $8.4 billion). It is appropriate to exclude the average AUM of our China JVs for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on AUM, because the revenues resulting from these AUM are not presented in our operating revenues. Under U.S. GAAP, our share of the net income of the JVs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Gross revenue yield, the most comparable U.S. GAAP-based measure to net revenue yield, is not considered a meaningful effective fee rate measure. The numerator of the gross revenue yield measure, operating revenues, excludes the management fees earned from CIP; however, the denominator of the measure includes the AUM of these investment products. Therefore, the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the company's true effective fee rate from AUM.\n(d)\nNet revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average AUM. See the reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Information on pages 8 through 10 of this release for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.\n(e)\nThe alternatives asset class includes absolute return, commodities, currencies, financial structures, global macro, long/short equity, managed futures, multi-alternatives, private capital - direct, private capital - fund of funds, private direct real estate, public real estate securities, senior secured loans and custom solutions.\n(f)\nLong-term AUM excludes institutional money market and non-management fee earning AUM. Ending AUM as of March 31, 2018 includes $74.5 billion in institutional money market AUM and $88.1 billion in non-management fee earning AUM. (December 31, 2017: $74.0 billion and $87.8 billion, respectively; March 31, 2017: $65.2 billion and $77.6 billion, respectively).\n(g)\nPassive AUM includes ETFs, UITs, certain non-fee earning leverage and other passive mandates. Active AUM are total AUM less Passive AUM.\n(h)\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, $29.5 billion of AUM were transferred from retail into institutional to better reflect the activities of institutional sales teams and the clients they support.\nInvesco Ltd.\nInvestment Capabilities Performance Overviw\nBenchmark Comparison\nPeer Group Comparison\n% of AUM Ahead of\nBenchmark\n% of AUM In Top Half of\nPeer Group\nEquities\n1yr\n3yr\n5yr\n1yr\n3yr\n5yr\nU.S. Core\n20\n%\n10\n%\n13\n%\n25\n%\n6\n%\n7\n%\nU.S. Growth\n40\n%\n27\n%\n83\n%\n36\n%\n36\n%\n83\n%\nU.S. Value\n57\n%\n47\n%\n52\n%\n40\n%\n47\n%\n51\n%\nSector\n45\n%\n29\n%\n22\n%\n22\n%\n22\n%\n19\n%\nU.K.\n13\n%\n7\n%\n100\n%\n9\n%\n7\n%\n15\n%\nCanadian\n5\n%\n11\n%\n29\n%\n—\n%\n11\n%\n11\n%\nAsian\n62\n%\n71\n%\n90\n%\n68\n%\n89\n%\n87\n%\nContinental European\n95\n%\n98\n%\n99\n%\n77\n%\n74\n%\n98\n%\nGlobal\n65\n%\n63\n%\n65\n%\n61\n%\n72\n%\n84\n%\nGlobal Ex U.S. and Emerging Markets\n11\n%\n26\n%\n77\n%\n2\n%\n19\n%\n10\n%\nFixed Income\nMoney Market\n99\n%\n99\n%\n99\n%\n97\n%\n98\n%\n97\n%\nU.S. Fixed Income\n89\n%\n89\n%\n87\n%\n81\n%\n75\n%\n84\n%\nGlobal Fixed Income\n82\n%\n74\n%\n67\n%\n77\n%\n40\n%\n53\n%\nStable Value\n100\n%\n100\n%\n100\n%\n100\n%\n100\n%\n100\n%\nOther\nAlternatives\n83\n%\n86\n%\n74\n%\n46\n%\n86\n%\n56\n%\nBalanced\n48\n%\n48\n%\n51\n%\n40\n%\n92\n%\n90\n%\nNote: AUM measured in the one-, three-, and five-year peer group rankings represents 56%, 55%, and 52% of total Invesco AUM, respectively, and AUM measured versus benchmark on a one-, three-, and five-year basis represents 70%, 67%, and 62% of total Invesco AUM, respectively, as of March 31, 2018. Peer group rankings are sourced from a widely-used third party ranking agency in each fund's market (Lipper, Morningstar, IA, Russell, Mercer, eVestment Alliance, SITCA, Value Research) and are asset-weighted in U.S. Dollars. Rankings are as of prior quarter-end for most institutional products and preceding month-end for Australian retail funds due to their late release by third parties. Rankings for the most representative fund in each Global Investment Performance Standard (GIPS) composite are applied to all products within each GIPS composite. Excludes passive products, closed-end funds, private equity limited partnerships, non-discretionary funds, unit investment trusts, fund-of-funds with component funds managed by Invesco, stable value building block funds, and Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs). Certain funds and products were excluded from the analysis because of limited benchmark or peer group data. Had these been available, results may have been different. These results are preliminary and subject to revision. Performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends. Past performance is not indicative of future results and may not reflect an investor's experience.\nInvesco Ltd.\nSupplemental Information (1)\nThree months ended March 31, 2018\nCash flow information\n$ in millions\nU.S. GAAP\nImpact\nof CIP\nExcluding\nCIP\nInvesco and CIP cash and cash equivalents, beginning of period\n$\n2,517.7\n$\n511.3\n$\n2,006.4\nCash flows from operating activities\n(52.2)\n(53.3)\n1.1\nCash flows from investing activities\n(297.8)\n(276.6)\n(21.2)\nCash flows from financing activities\n(44.6)\n117.7\n(162.3)\nForeign exchange movement on cash and cash equivalents\n38.5\n1.0\n37.5\nIncrease/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n(356.1)\n(211.2)\n(144.9)\nNet cash inflows (outflows) upon consolidation/deconsolidation of CIP\n(39.3)\n(39.3)\n—\nInvesco and CIP cash and cash equivalents, end of the period\n$\n2,122.3\n$\n260.8\n$\n1,861.5\nAs of March 31, 2018\nBalance Sheet information\n$ in millions\nU.S. GAAP\nImpact of CIP\nImpact of Policyholders\nAs Adjusted\nASSETS\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,861.5\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n1,861.5\nUnsettled fund receivables\n837.6\n—\n—\n837.6\nInvestments\n713.6\n(441.1)\n—\n1,154.7\nInvestments and other assets of CIP\n5,611.0\n5,611.0\n—\n—\nCash and cash equivalents of CIP\n260.8\n260.8\n—\n—\nAssets held for policyholders\n12,902.2\n—\n12,902.2\n—\nGoodwill and intangible assets, net\n8,163.6\n—\n—\n8,163.6\nOther assets (2)\n1,268.8\n(3.9)\n—\n1,272.7\nTotal assets\n31,619.1\n5,426.8\n12,902.2\n13,290.1\nLIABILITIES\nDebt of CIP\n4,502.7\n4,502.7\n—\n—\nOther liabilities of CIP\n349.5\n349.5\n—\n—\nPolicyholder payables\n12,902.2\n—\n12,902.2\n—\nUnsettled fund payables\n811.5\n—\n—\n811.5\nLong-term debt\n2,076.4\n—\n—\n2,076.4\nOther liabilities (3)\n1,505.8\n—\n—\n1,505.8\nTotal liabilities\n22,148.1\n4,852.2\n12,902.2\n4,393.7\nEQUITY\nTotal equity attributable to Invesco Ltd.\n8,895.3\n(0.1)\n—\n8,895.4\nNoncontrolling interests (4)\n575.7\n574.7\n—\n1.0\nTotal equity\n9,471.0\n574.6\n—\n8,896.4\nTotal liabilities and equity\n$\n31,619.1\n$\n5,426.8\n$\n12,902.2\n$\n13,290.1\n(1)\nThese tables include non-GAAP presentations.
