    "text": "Fort Detrick, Maryland , April 10, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --\nThe US Army issued a solicitation for Economically Disadvantaged Woman Owned Small Businesses (EDWOSB) who can provide a shipment of 250 tons of rock salt to their location in Fort Detrick, Maryland. They are only taking Quote: s from EDWOSBs. The last day a small business can submit a Quote: is April 18, 2018. For assistance meeting this deadline with proper registrations and a strong offer, small businesses may use third-party government registration firm, US Federal Contractor Registration (USFCR).\nThe requirements to fulfill the Army's needs are found on the federal business opportunity solicitation which can be located on the Advanced Procurement Portal from USFCR. Businesses will see on the solicitation that the Army is holding a reverse auction on a third-party auction site where bids may decrease by $1. The reverse auction ends on April 10, 2018. The 250-ton order must consist of 95% rock salt (by weight). The rock salt must be finely graded and granular, free flowing with no clumps and contain anti-caking additive. Delivery of the product must occur within sixty days of the award decision and the salt should contain no more than 2% moisture at the time of delivery.\nThis brief summary of requirements must be supplemented with a full-read of the actual solicitation. Further questions should be filtered through the third-party reverse auction holder. Businesses should immediately get started making sure they are registered properly to submit offers to the government. Contracting officers will be unable to assist with specific contractor requirements such as registration in the System for Award Management (SAM).\nSAM is the mandatory registration that all federal contractors must complete before making offers to perform any work for the government. This system can be tricky to handle, especially when trying to meet a deadline and put a Quote: together. For assistance with all of these matters, US Federal Contractor Registration is standing by to provide.\nUS Federal Contractor Registration (USFCR) is the world’s largest third-party government registration firm. They have helped thousands of entities translate their capabilities into the U.S. Government’s language and systems with the Simplified Acquisition Program , bid training and proposal writing services . They not only register companies on their behalf in SAM , but also have pioneered the Advanced Procurement Portal (APP) . APP shows active and historical federal business opportunity information in the same place, simplifying market research. Active federal buyers and vendors are not only cataloged in APP, but also are also using the system, creating a powerful network. Businesses who partner with USFCR will be able dedicate their complete effort toward their performance on a contract, rather than the acquisition of it.\nIf you would like more information please contact David Rockwell at (877) 252-2700 ext.750 or by email at drockwell@usfcrgov.com .
