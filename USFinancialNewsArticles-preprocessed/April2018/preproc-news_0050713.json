    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - The independent directors of pay-TV group Sky said they were withdrawing their recommendation of a takeover bid from Rupert Murdoch’s Fox after U.S. cable company Comcast Corp trumped it with a 22 billion pound ($30.68 billion) offer.\nFILE PHOTO: The Sky logo is seen on outside of an entrance to offices and studios in west London, Britain June 29, 2017. REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo “As a result of the announcement of this higher cash offer, the independent committee is withdrawing its recommendation of the offer announced by Twenty-First Century Fox on 15 December 2016 and is now terminating the Co-operation Agreement entered into with Twenty-First Century Fox on the same date,” Sky’s independent directors said in a statement on Wednesday.\n($1 = 0.7170 pounds)\nReporting by Sarah Young, editing by James Davey\n ",
