Bringing together World Wide Packaging’s strong design capabilities, rich library and fast turnaround times, with reliable manufacturing capabilities in China, the combined entity will be well-placed to provide innovative solutions to beauty brands in the US and beyond.\nEstablished in 1980, World Wide Packaging provides the cosmetics and personal care industries with a complete range of packaging components, custom and stock molding, and full service turnkey operations.

The firm has extensive experience in consumer industries having invested in companies like Carver Korea, Canada Goose, and Blue Nile, among many others. It also has experience merging the operations of two companies, both in the US and across multiple regions.\nJonathan Zhu, a Managing Director at Bain Capital Private Equity, said: “With this deal, the combined entity will have a customer-facing function primarily in the US, and manufacturing, sales and marketing operations in China. We look forward to working with World Wide Packaging to preserve and enhance its presence in the independent beauty market and grow its presence among large beauty players, in the US and beyond, particularly in China, where demand for cosmetics is growing three times as fast as the US.”\n- End -\nAbout Bain Capital Private Equity\nBain Capital Private Equity ( www.baincapitalprivateequity.com ) has partnered closely with management teams to provide the strategic resources that build great companies and help them thrive since its founding in 1984.
