    "text": "First Quarter Revenue Grows 30 Percent Driven by 27 Percent Increase in Attendance\nGRAND PRAIRIE, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Six Flags Entertainment Corporation (NYSE: SIX), the world’s largest regional theme park company, today announced that revenue for the first quarter of 2018 increased by $29 million or 30 percent from the first quarter of 2017 to a record-high $129 million. The revenue growth resulted primarily from a 27 percent increase in the number of guests visiting Six Flags parks, and the success of both the company’s pricing strategy and international licensing program. Attendance at Six Flags properties grew by 0.5 million to 2.4 million guests. This increase was driven by additional operating days from Six Flags Magic Mountain moving to a 365-day calendar; Hurricane Harbor Mexico being open in the first quarter, while not open in the first quarter of 2017; adjustments to park operating schedules due to the earlier timing of the Easter holiday; and additional attendance due to the company’s higher Active Pass Base, which represents the total number of guests who have purchased a season pass or who are enrolled in the company’s membership program.\n“We are firing on all cylinders as we made excellent progress in the quarter against each of our five growth initiatives,” said Jim Reid-Anderson, Chairman, President and CEO. “With our record-high Active Pass Base, ongoing price increases across all ticket and culinary programs, growing dining pass penetration, new water park openings and new international licensing agreements, we are poised to deliver another record year of financial performance in 2018. We remain laser-focused on exceeding $600 million of Modified EBITDA 1 in 2018 and continue to work toward our long-term aspirational goal of $750 million of Modified EBITDA by 2020.”\nSince most of the parks were not scheduled to be open during the first quarter, the company had a net loss during the quarter of $62 million. The loss per share for the first quarter of 2018 was $0.74 compared to a loss per share of $0.63 in the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to a reduced tax benefit in the quarter because of federal tax reform. Adjusted EBITDA 2 for the first quarter was a loss of $19 million, an improvement of $16 million over the prior year period primarily due to the 27 percent increase in attendance and higher guest spending per capita. Modified EBITDA for the twelve months ended March 31, 2018, was $574 million, an increase of $41 million or 8 percent compared to the twelve months ended March 31, 2017. Modified EBITDA margin for the 12-month period improved to a new industry high of 41.4 percent.\nThe company’s Active Pass Base increased 10 percent year-over-year to a new all-time high for the first quarter. Increasing season pass and membership penetration is a key tenet of the company’s growth strategy, providing a platform of recurring revenue and the ability to further grow attendance as the company expands its network of parks. Season pass holders, and especially members, are the company’s most loyal and valuable guests, generating more recurring revenue and cash flow for the company than a single day guest. Season passes and memberships also provide an excellent hedge against inclement weather throughout the season.\nDeferred revenue of $182 million as of March 31, 2018, increased by $25 million or 16 percent from March 31, 2017, primarily due to a higher level of season pass, membership and all season dining pass sales for the 2018 season.\nTotal guest spending per capita for the first quarter of 2018 was $46.07, an increase of $1.78 or 4 percent compared to the first quarter of 2017. Admissions revenue per capita increased $0.66 to $28.15 and in-park spending per capita increased $1.12 to $17.93. Favorable foreign currency rate translation accounted for $0.59 of the increase in total guest spending per capita, although it had a negligible impact on Modified EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the company invested $42 million in new capital projects. The company also paid $66.0 million in dividends, or $0.78 per common share, and repurchased 1.3 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $81 million, leaving 83.5 million shares of stock outstanding as of March 31, 2018. The authorized share repurchase amount available as of March 31, 2018, was $262 million.\nNet Debt 3 as of March 31, 2018, calculated as total reported debt of $2.18 billion less cash and cash equivalents of $33 million, was $2.14 billion, representing a net leverage ratio of 4.0 times Adjusted EBITDA.\nPrevious Announcements\nOn February 20, 2018, the company announced an ambitious initiative to power two more of its parks almost entirely with solar power, bringing the number of parks in this program to three. Once the projects are constructed, the company expects to save approximately $3 million per year in energy costs.\nOn March 26, 2018, the company announced that its lenders approved a reduction to the borrowing rate on the company’s Term Loan B Credit Facility, reducing the company’s borrowing rate by 25 basis points. In conjunction with the repricing, the company increased the size of its Term Loan B Credit Facility by $39 million, which funded on April 18, 2018. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases.\nOn April 4, 2018, the company and Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) announced plans to develop a Six Flags-branded theme park in the city of Riyadh.\nOn April 24, 2018, the company and its partner in China, Riverside Investment Group, announced a licensing agreement to develop three Six Flags-branded parks in Nanjing, China, which will be the partner’s third park complex. The parks are expected to begin opening in 2021.\nConference Call\nAt 8:00 a.m. Central Time tomorrow, April 25, 2018, the company will host a conference call to discuss its first quarter 2018 financial performance.

In our press release, we make reference to non-GAAP financial measures including Modified EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Free Cash Flow. The definition for each of these non-GAAP financial measures is set forth below in the notes to the reconciliation tables. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide important and useful information for investors to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period and make it easier to compare our results with those of other companies in our industry. We use these measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes, to evaluate ongoing operations and our performance generally, and in our annual and long-term incentive plans. By providing these measures, we provide our investors with the ability to review our performance in the same manner as our management.\nHowever, because these non-GAAP financial measures are not determined in accordance with GAAP, they are susceptible to varying calculations, and not all companies calculate these measures in the same manner. As a result, these non-GAAP financial measures as presented may not be directly comparable to a similarly titled non-GAAP financial measure presented by another company. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented as supplemental information and not as alternatives to any GAAP financial measures. When reviewing a non-GAAP financial measure, we encourage our investors to fully review and consider the related reconciliation as detailed below.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months and twelve months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017:\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended (Amounts in thousands) March 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017\nNet (loss) income $ (62,345 ) $ (57,548 ) $ 308,229 $ 146,114 Income tax (benefit) expense (19,675 ) (37,591 ) 33,942 62,808 Other expense (income), net 1,935 (903 ) 3,109 82 Loss on debt extinguishment — — 37,116 2,935 Interest expense, net 25,885 21,001 103,894 83,415 Loss on disposal of assets 1,911 670 5,200 3,121 Amortization 611 648 2,428 2,601 Depreciation 28,018 26,643 110,581 105,555 Stock-based compensation 4,553 11,990 (30,134 ) 126,323 Impact of Fresh Start valuation adjustments (2) 3 10 33 77 Modified EBITDA (3) (19,104 ) (35,080 ) 574,398 533,031 Third party interest in EBITDA of certain operations (4) — — (39,210 ) (38,425 ) Adjusted EBITDA (3) $ (19,104 ) $ (35,080 ) $ 535,188 $ 494,606 Weighted-average common shares outstanding — basic: 84,457 91,151 85,151 92,051 SIX FLAGS ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of net cash (used in) provided by operating activities to Adjusted Free Cash Flow for the three months and twelve months ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017:\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended (Amounts in thousands) March 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017\nMarch 31,\n2018\nMarch 31,\n2017\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (22,807 ) $ (60,588 ) $ 482,848 $ 455,652 Changes in working capital (28,004 ) 2,942 (26,476 ) (13,282 ) Interest expense, net 25,885 21,001 103,894 83,415 Income tax (benefit) expense (19,675 ) (37,591 ) 33,942 62,808 Amortization of debt issuance costs (962 ) (1,171 ) (3,852 ) (4,608 ) Other expense (income), net 26 1,171 (3,790 ) 1,826 Interest accretion on notes payable (335 ) (92 ) (1,299 ) (388 ) Changes in deferred income taxes 26,765 39,238 (10,902 ) (52,469 ) Impact of Fresh Start valuation adjustments (2) 3 10 33 77 Third party interest in EBITDA of certain operations (4) — — (39,210 ) (38,425 ) Capital expenditures (42,483 ) (51,634 ) (125,545 ) (138,030 ) Cash paid for interest, net (29,622 ) (35,774 ) (89,137 ) (75,907 ) Cash taxes (5) (6,994 ) (2,662 ) (18,805 ) (13,950 ) Adjusted Free Cash Flow (6) $ (98,203\n) $ (125,150 ) $ 301,701\n$ 266,719 Weighted-average common shares outstanding — basic: 84,457 91,151 85,151 92,051 (1) Revenues and expenses of international operations are converted into U.S. dollars on an average basis as provided by GAAP. (2) Amounts recorded as valuation adjustments and included in reorganization items for the month of April 2010 that would have been included in Modified EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, had fresh start accounting not been applied. Balance consists primarily of discounted insurance reserves that will be accreted through the statement of operations each quarter through 2018. (3) “Modified EBITDA”, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as our consolidated income (loss) from continuing operations: excluding the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, discontinued operations gains or losses, income tax expense or benefit, restructure costs or recoveries, reorganization items (net), other income or expense, gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt, equity in income or loss of investees, interest expense (net), gain or loss on disposal of assets, gain or loss on the sale of investees, amortization, depreciation, stock-based compensation, and fresh start accounting valuation adjustments. Modified EBITDA as defined herein may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Management uses non-GAAP measures for budgeting purposes, measuring actual results, allocating resources and in determining employee incentive compensation. We believe that Modified EBITDA provides relevant and useful information for investors because it assists in comparing our operating performance on a consistent basis, makes it easier to compare our results with those of other companies in our industry as it most closely ties our performance to that of our competitors from a park level perspective and allows investors to review performance in the same manner as our management.\n\"Adjusted EBITDA\", a non-GAAP measure, is defined as Modified EBITDA minus the interests of third parties in the Adjusted EBITDA of properties that are less than wholly owned (consisting of Six Flags Over Georgia, Six Flags White Water Atlanta and Six Flags Over Texas). Adjusted EBITDA is approximately equal to “Parent Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA” as defined in our secured credit agreement, except that Parent Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA excludes Adjusted EBITDA from equity investees that is not distributed to us in cash on a net basis and has limitations on the amounts of certain expenses that are excluded from the calculation. Adjusted EBITDA as defined herein may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Our board of directors and management use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our performance and our current management incentive compensation plans are based largely on Adjusted EBITDA. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by all our sell-side analysts and most investors as their primary measure of our performance in the evaluation of companies in our industry. In addition, the instruments governing our indebtedness use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our compliance with certain covenants and, in certain circumstances, our ability to make certain borrowings. Adjusted EBITDA, as computed by us, may not be comparable to similar metrics used by other companies in our industry.\n(4) Represents interests of third parties in the Adjusted EBITDA of Six Flags Over Georgia, Six Flags Over Texas and Six Flags White Water Atlanta. (5) Based on our current federal net operating loss carryforwards, we believe we will continue to pay minimal amounts for cash taxes for the next two years. Cash taxes paid represents statutory taxes paid, primarily driven by Mexico and state level obligations. (6) Management uses Adjusted Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP measure, in its financial and operational decision making processes, for internal reporting, and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes as it provides additional transparency of our operations. Management believes that Adjusted Free Cash Flow is useful information to investors regarding the amount of cash that we estimate that we will generate from operations over a certain period. Management believes the presentation of this measure will enhance the investors' ability to analyze trends in the business and evaluate the Company's underlying performance relative to other companies in the industry. A reconciliation from net cash (used in) provided by operating activities to Adjusted Free Cash Flow is presented in the table above. Adjusted Free Cash Flow as presented herein may differ from similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180424006369/en/\nSix Flags Entertainment Corporation\nStephen Purtell, +1-972-595-5180\nSenior Vice President\nInvestor Relations and Treasurer\nspurtell@sftp.com\nSource: Six Flags Entertainment Corporation",
