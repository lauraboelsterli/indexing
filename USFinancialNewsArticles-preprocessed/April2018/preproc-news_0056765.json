PayPal Holdings, Inc.\nNon-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance\nTo supplement the company's condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and free cash flow.\nThese non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the company's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These measures should only be used to evaluate the company's results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.\nReconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure of all non-GAAP measures included in this press release can be found in the tables included in this press release.\nThese non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance investors' overall understanding of the company's current financial performance and its prospects for the future. Specifically, the company believes the non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors by excluding certain expenses, gains and losses, as the case may be, that may not be indicative of its core operating results and business outlook. In addition, because the company has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the company believes that the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the company's financial reporting.\nFor its internal budgeting process, and as discussed further below, the company's management uses financial measures that do not include stock-based compensation expense, employer payroll taxes on stock-based compensation, amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, restructuring-related charges, other certain gains, losses, benefits or charges that are not indicative of the company's core operating results and the income taxes associated with the foregoing. In addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, the company's management also uses the foregoing non-GAAP measures in reviewing the financial results of the company.\nThe company excludes the following items from non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP effective tax rate:\nStock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes. This consists of expenses for equity awards under our equity incentive plans. We exclude stock-based compensation expense from our non-GAAP measures primarily because they are non-cash expenses. The related employer payroll taxes are dependent on our stock price and the timing and size of exercises and vesting of equity awards, over which management has limited to no control, and as such management does not believe it correlates to the operation of our business.\nAmortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets, impairment of goodwill, and transaction expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business. We incur amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill in connection with acquisitions and may incur significant gains or losses or transactional expenses from the acquisition or disposal of a business and therefore exclude these amounts from our non-GAAP measures. We exclude these items because management does not believe they are reflective of our ongoing operating results.\nRestructuring. These consist of expenses for employee severance and other exit and disposal costs. The company excludes significant restructuring charges primarily because management does not believe they are reflective of ongoing operating results.\nCertain other significant gains, losses, benefits, or charges that are not indicative of the company’s core operating results. These are significant gains, losses, benefits, or charges during a period that are the result of isolated events or transactions which have not occurred frequently in the past and are not expected to occur regularly in the future. The company excludes these amounts from its non-GAAP results because management does not believe they are indicative of its current or ongoing operating results.\nTax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. This adjustment is made to present stock-based compensation and the other amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income.\nThe company also uses free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure. Free cash flow represents operating cash flows less purchases of property and equipment. The company considers free cash flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property, buildings, and equipment, which can then be used to, among other things, invest in the company's business, make strategic acquisitions, and repurchase stock. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of financial performance is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the company's cash balance for the period.\nIn addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, the company also analyzes certain measures, including net revenues and operating expenses, on an FX-neutral basis to better measure the comparability of operating results between periods. The company believes that changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not indicative of the company’s operations and evaluating growth in net revenues and operating expenses on an FX-neutral basis provides an additional meaningful and comparable assessment of these measures to both management and investors. FX-neutral results are calculated by translating the current period’s local currency results with the prior period’s exchange rate. FX-neutral growth rates are calculated by comparing the current period's FX-neutral results by the prior period's results, excluding the impact from hedging activities.\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nReconciliation of GAAP Operating Margin to Non-GAAP Operating Margin\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (In millions, except percentages) (unaudited) GAAP operating income $ 534 $ 431 Stock-based compensation expense and related employer payroll taxes 241 149 Amortization of acquired intangible assets 29 23 Restructuring 25 40 Total non-GAAP operating income adjustments 295 212 Non-GAAP operating income $ 829 $ 643 Non-GAAP operating margin 22 % 22 % Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Non-GAAP Net Income,\nGAAP Diluted EPS to Non-GAAP Diluted EPS,\nand GAAP Effective Tax Rate to Non-GAAP Effective Tax Rate\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018 2017 (In millions, except per share data and percentages) (unaudited) GAAP income before income taxes $ 548 $ 438 GAAP income tax expense 37 54 GAAP net income 511 384 Non-GAAP adjustments to net income: Non-GAAP operating income adjustments (see table above) 295 212 Other (1) 3 — Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments (117 ) (62 ) Non-GAAP net income $ 692 $ 534 Diluted net income per share: GAAP $ 0.42 $ 0.32 Non-GAAP $ 0.57 $ 0.44 Shares used in GAAP diluted share calculation 1,217 1,216 Shares used in non-GAAP diluted share calculation 1,217 1,216 GAAP effective tax rate 7 % 12 % Tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments to net income 11 % 6 % Non-GAAP effective tax rate 18 % 18 % (1) Tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nReconciliation of Operating Cash Flow to Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 (In millions/unaudited) Net cash provided by operating activities $ (349 ) $ 751 Less: Purchases of property and equipment (178 ) (148 ) Free cash flow $ (527 ) $ 603 Impact of held for sale accounting presentation on cash flow from operating activities 1,260 — Adjusted free cash flow $ 733 $ 603\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180425006571/en/\nPayPal Holdings, Inc.\nInvestor Relations Contacts\nGabrielle Rabinovitch\nVice President, Investor Relations\ngrabinovitch@paypal.com\nor\nAkila Moorthy\nDirector, Investor Relations\namoorthy@paypal.com\nor\nMedia Relations Contacts\nMartha Cass\nSenior Director, Corporate Communications\nmcass@paypal.com\nor\nAmanda Miller, 408-219-0563\nDirector, Corporate Communications\namandacmiller@paypal.com\nSource: PayPal Holdings, Inc.",
