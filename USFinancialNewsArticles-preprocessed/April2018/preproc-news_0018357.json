    "text": "April 11, 2018 / 8:07 AM / Updated 17 minutes ago Foreign rivals eye Israel's Frutarom: media Tova Cohen , Arno Schuetze 3 Min Read \nTEL AVIV/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Two overseas companies recently approached Israel’s Frutarom Industries ( FRUT.TA ) regarding the possibility of acquiring the flavors and fine ingredients maker, financial news website Calcalist reported on Wednesday. \nFrutarom said in a statement in response to the report that it had not reached any agreements about a possible deal. \nFrutarom has a market value of $5.5 billion and any acquisition deal could be worth $6 billion-$6.5 billion, Israel’s Calcalist said, adding that one of the interested companies was U.S.-based International Flavors & Fragrances ( IFF.N ), the No. 2 player in the sector. \nIt did not name the other company, but TheMarker, another website, said Germany’s Symrise ( SY1G.DE ) was interested. \nA spokesman for Symrise, whose biggest acquisition was French group Diana for 1.3 billion euros ($1.6 billion), declined to comment. \nAn IFF spokesman said it was the company’s policy not to respond to speculation and rumors. \nThe report sent Frutarom’s shares up 7 percent in Tel Aviv. \nIn a statement to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, Frutarom said it held talks from time to time regarding possible strategic measures, including via a merger or acquisition. \n“The company has not reached any agreements with any party regarding a deal and there is no certainty that such talks will lead to an agreement for a deal or what the terms would be,” it said. “The company continues to focus on achieving its business targets.” \nGeneva-based Givaudan ( GIVN.S ) said last month it planned to launch an offer for French natural ingredients group Naturex ( NATU.PA ) after agreeing to buy a half-billion euro minority stake in the firm. \nGivaudan is the market leader, ahead of peers such as Firmenich, IFF, Symrise, Takasago and Mane. \nTwo bankers familiar with the industry said the flavors and fragrances sector was expected to see consolidation in coming months. \n“Everyone is talking to everyone, and that also involves Frutarom,” one of the people said. \nFrutarom itself has been growing through a steady stream of acquisitions in recent years, having bought 12 firms in 2017. \nAs Frutarom has managed the acquired firms at arm’s length, some potential buyers are deterred by what they view as an overly complex corporate structure. \nWhile a grab for market share by one of the top players of the industry cannot be ruled out, moves by consumer goods producers entering the industry are also a possibility, the sources added. \nFrutarom reported a 23.7 percent rise fourth-quarter sales to a record $357.5 million. The company expects 2018 to be another record year. It is targeting $2.25 billion in sales by 2020.
