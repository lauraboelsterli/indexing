    "text": "HONOLULU, April 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Central Pacific Financial Corp. (NYSE: CPF), (the \"Company\"), today reported net income in the first quarter of 2018 of $14.3 million, or diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") of $0.48, compared to net income in the first quarter of 2017 of $13.1 million, or EPS of $0.42, and net income in the fourth quarter of 2017 of $4.3 million, or EPS of $0.14.\n\"We are pleased to report on another solid quarter of net income driven primarily by continued loan and deposit growth,\" said Catherine Ngo, President and Chief Executive Officer. \"Our earnings and strong capital position have allowed our company to increase our quarterly cash dividend and continue executing on our stock repurchase plan.\"\nIn April 2018, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per share on its outstanding common shares. This represents a 10.5% increase from the $0.19 dividend paid in the first quarter of 2018. The dividend will be payable on June 15, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 31, 2018.\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the Company repurchased 344,362 shares of common stock, or approximately 1.1% of its common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2017. Total cost of the shares repurchased was $10.1 million, or an average cost per share of $29.36. The Company's remaining repurchase authority under its common stock repurchase program at March 31, 2018 is $43.4 million.\nEarnings Highlights\nNet interest income for the first quarter of 2018 was $42.3 million, compared to $41.3 million in the year-ago quarter and $42.8 million in the previous quarter. Net interest margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 3.21%, compared to 3.30% in the year-ago quarter and 3.27% in the previous quarter. The increase in net interest income from the year-ago quarter was primarily due to growth in the loan portfolio, combined with an increase in the taxable-equivalent yield earned on the investment security portfolio. These increases were partially offset by higher deposit and borrowing costs attributable to the recent increases in the federal funds rate, which also resulted in the decline in the net interest margin from the year-ago quarter. The decrease in net interest income and net interest margin from the previous quarter was primarily due to a decline in yields earned on the loan and investment securities portfolios, combined with higher rates paid on time deposits and borrowings.\nOther operating income for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $9.0 million, compared to $10.0 million in the year-ago quarter and $9.0 million in the previous quarter. The decrease from the year-ago quarter was primarily due to lower income from bank-owned life insurance of $0.8 million and lower income recovered on nonaccrual loans previously charged-off of $0.5 million, partially offset by higher commissions on investment services of $0.3 million (included in other service charges and fees). The lower income from bank-owned life insurance was primarily attributable to death benefit income of $0.6 million recorded in the year-ago quarter. Other operating income remained relatively unchanged from the previous quarter.\nOther operating expense for the first quarter of 2018 totaled $33.5 million, which increased from $31.5 million in the year-ago quarter and decreased from $34.5 million in the previous quarter. The increase from the year-ago quarter was primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefits of $1.1 million, combined with the write-down of a foreclosed asset of $0.3 million (included in foreclosed asset expense). The higher salaries and employee benefits expense was primarily attributable to the increase in the Company's starting pay rate and the pay scale for other wage progression positions effective January 1, 2018, combined with annual merit increases effective in the second quarter of 2017. The sequential quarter decrease was primarily due to lower advertising expense of $0.4 million, lower legal and professional services of $0.3 million, lower salaries and employee benefits of $0.3 million, and lower net occupancy expense of $0.2 million, partially offset by higher foreclosed asset expense of $0.3 million. The lower salaries and employee benefits from the sequential quarter were primarily attributable to a special, one-time bonus totaling $0.8 million given to all employees, with the exception of executives on the Company's managing committee, in the fourth quarter of 2017, partially offset by higher salaries paid during the current quarter due to aforementioned increases in pay rates.\nThe efficiency ratio for the first quarter of 2018 was 65.37%, compared to 61.36% in the year-ago quarter and 66.54% in the previous quarter. The increase in the efficiency ratio from the year-ago quarter was primarily due to the aforementioned lower other operating income combined with higher other operating expenses in the current quarter compared to the year-ago quarter, partially offset by the improvement in net interest income. The improvement in the efficiency ratio compared to the previous quarter was due to the aforementioned lower other operating expenses, partially offset by the lower net interest income.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded income tax expense of $3.7 million, compared to $6.8 million in the year-ago quarter and $13.3 million in the previous quarter. Income tax expense in the previous quarter included a one-time, non-cash estimated charge of $7.4 million to income tax expense due to the revaluation of the Company's net deferred tax assets in connection with the enactment of H.R.1, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 20.5%, compared to 34.2% in the year-ago quarter and 75.6% in the previous quarter. The decline in income tax expense and effective tax rate in the current quarter was primarily due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nBalance Sheet Highlights\nTotal assets at March 31, 2018 of $5.65 billion increased by $208.1 million, or 3.8% from March 31, 2017, and increased by $27.6 million, or 0.5% from December 31, 2017.\nTotal loans and leases at March 31, 2018 of $3.82 billion increased by $270.4 million, or 7.6% and $45.5 million, or 1.2% from March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The increase in total loans and leases from March 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to strong organic growth in the Hawaii loan portfolios, combined with an increase in the U.S. mainland commercial mortgage portfolio, partially offset by reductions in the Hawaii construction loan portfolio and the U.S. mainland consumer loan portfolio. The increase in total loans and leases from the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to strong organic growth in the Hawaii loan portfolios, partially offset by a reduction in the U.S. mainland consumer loan portfolio.\nTotal deposits at March 31, 2018 of $4.98 billion increased by $203.0 million, or 4.2% from March 31, 2017, and increased by $24.1 million, or 0.5% from December 31, 2017. Core deposits, which include demand deposits, savings and money market deposits, and time deposits less than $100,000, totaled $4.01 billion at March 31, 2018. This represents an increase of $196.0 million, or 5.1% from March 31, 2017, and an increase of $15.7 million, or 0.4% from December 31, 2017.\nAsset Quality\nNonperforming assets at March 31, 2018 totaled $3.4 million, or 0.06% of total assets, compared to $8.8 million, or 0.16% of total assets at March 31, 2017, and $3.6 million, or 0.06% of total assets at December 31, 2017.\nLoans delinquent for 90 days or more still accruing interest totaled $0.4 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $0.2 million and $0.6 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nNet charge-offs in the first quarter of 2018 totaled $0.6 million, compared to net charge-offs of $1.2 million in the year-ago quarter, and net charge-offs of $1.0 million in the previous quarter.\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a credit to the provision for loan and lease losses of $0.2 million, compared to a credit of $0.1 million in the year-ago quarter and a credit of $0.2 million in the previous quarter. The allowance for loan and lease losses, as a percentage of total loans and leases at March 31, 2018 was 1.29%, compared to 1.56% at March 31, 2017 and 1.33% at December 31, 2017.\nCapital\nTotal shareholders' equity was $484.1 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $511.5 million and $500.0 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nThe Company maintained its strong capital position and its capital ratios continue to exceed the levels required to be considered a \"well-capitalized\" institution for regulatory purposes under Basel III. At March 31, 2018, the Company's leverage capital, tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital, and common equity tier 1 ratios were 10.3%, 14.5%, 15.8%, and 12.3%, respectively, compared to 10.4%, 14.7%, 15.9%, and 12.4%, respectively, at December 31, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains certain references to financial measures that have been adjusted to exclude certain expenses and other specified items. These financial measures differ from comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") in that they exclude unusual or non-recurring charges, losses, credits or gains. This press release identifies the specific items excluded from the comparable GAAP financial measure in the calculation of each non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that financial presentations excluding the impact of these items provide useful supplemental information that is important to a proper understanding of the Company's core business results by investors. These presentations should not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies.\nConference Call\nThe Company's management will host a conference call today at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time (7:00 a.m. Hawaii Time) to discuss the quarterly results. Individuals are encouraged to listen to the live webcast of the presentation by visiting the investor relations page of the Company's website at http://ir.centralpacificbank.com .
