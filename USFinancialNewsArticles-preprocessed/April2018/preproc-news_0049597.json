    "text": "SAN FRANCISCO, April 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP reminds investors in BRF S.A. ( NYSE: BRFS) of the May 11, 2018 Lead Plaintiff deadline in the food inspection bribery based securities class action pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Also, in an ominous note, on April 23, 2018, the new CEO of Brazil's largest poultry producer, José Aurélio Drummond Jr, resigned.\nIf you purchased or otherwise acquired securities of BRF S.A. between April 4, 2013 and March 2, 2018 and suffered losses contact Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP.

The probe is known as \"Operation Weak Flesh.\"\nThen, on March 5, 2018, Reuters reported Brazilian police arrested the former chief executive of BRF S.A. (Pedro Faria) on charges that he and other executives knew the company committed fraud in trying to evade food safety checks.\nThis news drove the price of BRF securities down $1.83, or over 19%, to close at $7.59 on March 5, 2018.\n\"We're focused on evidence unearthed by Brazil's federal police suggesting that the Company's management was aware of these illegal practices,\" said Hagens Berman partner Reed Kathrein.\nWhistleblowers: Persons with non-public information regarding BRF S.A. should consider their options to help in the investigation or take advantage of the SEC Whistleblower program. Under the new program, whistleblowers who provide original information may receive rewards totaling up to 30 percent of any successful recovery made by the SEC.
