REUTERS/Ernest Scheyder/File Photo \nU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery CLc1 was up 27 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $63.64 a barrel by 0445 GMT after settling down 14 cents. \nFront-month London Brent crude LCOc1 for June delivery was up 30 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $68.32, having ended down 10 cents. \nOil also got support from firm global equities, as the United States expressed willingness to negotiate a resolution on trade after proposed U.S. tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods prompted a quick response from Beijing that it would retaliate by targeting key American imports. \nOil prices have recently closely tracked equities. \n“The two countries are using discretion in their actions, and it does not look like the situation is developing into a full-scale trade war yet,” said Tomomichi Akuta, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting in Tokyo. “There is also hope for dialogue.” \nBefore the rebound late on Wednesday, after the release of the Energy Information Administration (EIA) inventory data, WTI and Brent had hit two-week lows after China proposed a broad range of tariffs on U.S. exports, feeding fears of a trade war. \nU.S. crude inventories fell by 4.6 million barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 246,000 barrels, EIA data showed on Wednesday. \nOil has also received support after a Reuters survey showed on Wednesday that OPEC oil output fell in March to an 11-month low due to declining Angolan exports, Libyan outages and a further slide in Venezuelan output. \nShanghai crude futures trading was closed on Thursday due to a public holiday in China. Trading will resume on Monday. Reporting by Osamu Tsukimori; Editing by Aaron Sheldrick",
