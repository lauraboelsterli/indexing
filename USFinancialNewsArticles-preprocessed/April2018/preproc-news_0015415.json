REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo \nThe upbeat start to the year for LVMH, the industry’s biggest company and parent to brands like Christian Dior and Moet & Chandon, sets an encouraging tone for peers at the start of their reporting season. \nLuxury goods firms benefited from a strong rebound in Asian demand last year, a momentum that has shown little signs of fading. \n“Despite the concerns about the toughening comparable basis in the luxury sector, we believe that LVMH’s results confirm the ongoing strong underlying trends in the market,” analysts at Berenberg said in a note. \nShares in Paris-based conglomerate Kering ( PRTP.PA ), owner of fashion label Gucci, also advanced by 3.8 percent while shares in Burberry ( BRBY.L ) climbed 1.7 percent.
