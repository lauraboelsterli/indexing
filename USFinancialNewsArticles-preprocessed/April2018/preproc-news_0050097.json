    "text": "April 23, 2018 / 2:35 PM / Updated 7 minutes ago CANADA STOCKS-TSX climbs, led by financials, Poloz comments Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nApril 23 (Reuters) - Canada’s main stock index rose on Monday, as financial shares gained and after Bank of Canada chief showed comfort with inflation running above the central bank’s 2 percent target. \n* At 9:38 a.m. ET (1338 GMT), the Toronto Stock Exchange’s S&P/TSX Composite Index rose 28.39 points, or 0.18 percent, to 15,512.71. \n* Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said he expects the inflation rate to be above 2 percent in 2018, but he is comfortable with that as long as the long-term trend is steady, according to reports on Sunday. \n* The heavy-weight financial sector gained 0.5 percent, boosted by Toronto-Dominion Bank and Royal Bank of Canada which were up about 0.5 percent. \n* Wall Street opened higher as gains in technology and industrial stocks led optimism about a strong earnings season. \n* 10-year U.S. Treasuries hit its highest level since January 2014 which sent global stocks lower and hurt prices of oil and gold. \n* The energy sector was down 0.3 percent, dragged down by Cenovus Energy trading 1.8 percent lower and Suncor Energy down marginally. \n* The materials index, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, was down 0.9 pct as gold prices slipped to their lowest level in nearly two years. \n* Seven of the 10 main index sectors were trading higher. \n* The TSX posted three new 52-week highs and no new lows. Across all Canadian issues there were six new 52-week highs and eight new lows. \n* The largest percentage gainer on the TSX was The Stars Group, which rose 9.7 percent. The Canadian gaming company on Saturday had agreed to buy Sky Betting and Gaming from owners CVC Capital Partners and Sky Plc, in a deal worth $4.7 billion. \n* The largest decliner was Tahoe Resources, down 7.4 percent after the company on Saturday reported a labor strike at its La Arena mine in Peru. \n* Among the most active Canadian stocks by volume were Athabasca Oil Co, Aurora Cannabis and Katanga Mining. \n* Volume on the TSX index was 10.06 million shares, while the total volume on Monday was 19.08 million shares.
