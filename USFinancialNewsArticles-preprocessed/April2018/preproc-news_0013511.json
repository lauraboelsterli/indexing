    "text": "Cleveland catcher Yan Gomes hit a two-run, walk-off home run with one out in the ninth inning to give the Indians a 3-1 victory over the Kansas City Royals on the coldest day in franchise history at Progressive Field on Sunday.\nYonder Alonso walked with one out in the ninth against Brandon Maurer (0-2) and Gomes hit the ninth pitch of his at-bat over the left-field fence for his second homer of the season. The temperature was 32 degrees at first pitch, the coldest start time at home in franchise history. It was 34 degrees at game time Saturday.\nCleveland (4-5) broke a 23-inning scoreless streak by tying the game at 1 without a hit in the eighth inning. Bradley Zimmer drew a walk off reliever Tim Hill to open the inning. Zimmer stole second and was sacrificed to third before Jason Kipnis reached on a throwing error by pitcher Justin Grimm to put runners on first and third.\nJose Ramirez hit a check-swing grounder to Grimm enabling Zimmer score. Cleveland had only four hits and has the worst batting average in the majors, .159.\nCody Allen (1-0) pitched a 1-2-3 ninth inning for the victory.\nKansas City took a 1-0 lead when Alex Gordon singled with one out in the fifth inning and was forced at second by Cam Gallagher before Jon Jay tripled to deep center for a 1-0 lead.\nRight fielder Jorge Soler had three hits for the Royals, breaking an 0-for-34 streak dating to July 2, 2017.\nJay walked twice and Mike Moustakas had two of the Royals’ nine hits.\nKansas City right-hander Jason Hammel pitched six scoreless innings, giving up three hits and walking two. He struck out five ix and left after throwing 88 pitches.\nCleveland right-hander Mike Clevinger gave up nine hits and one run in 7 1/3 innings, striking out four and walking two. Clevinger, who is 3-0 in six career appearances against the Royals, has given up one run in his first 12 1/3 innings this season.\nCleveland recalled outfielder Tyler Naquin after placing outfielder Lonnie Chisenhall on the disabled list Sunday because of a strained right calf suffered when he made a catch in Saturday’s game. Chisenhall missed almost two months with the same injury in 2017.\n— Field Level Media\n ",
