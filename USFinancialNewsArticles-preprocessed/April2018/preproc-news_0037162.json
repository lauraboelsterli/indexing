    "text": "NEW YORK, April 16 (Reuters) - The dollar remained at lower levels against a basket of currencies on Monday as domestic retail sales in March rose following three months of declines but failed to dispel some tradersâ€™ worries about economic growth cooling.\nAt 8:35 a.m. (1235 GMT), an index that tracks the greenback versus the euro, yen and four other currencies was down 0.25 percent at 89.575.
