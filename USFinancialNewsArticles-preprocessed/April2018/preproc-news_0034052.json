Chicago-based project44 is reaping the benefits with $35 million in new funding, the WSJ Logistics Report’s Erica E. Phillips writes, which the company says it will use to expand its technology across more of the supply chain . Project44 uses APIs, or application program interfaces, to connect systems of different companies and ease the “pain points” where shipments change hands. The company has made big inroads in the trucking industry, where networks of operators and freight brokers have been under pressure to increase transparency in operations. The new funding will boost project44’s plans to draw in ocean shipping and take its APIs to Europe and Asia. For investors, it’s a growing business: Gartner Inc. says the market for supply chain management software will surpass $19 billion in revenue by 2021.\nThe souring U.S.-China trade relations are reaching deeper into technology supply chains. New orders from the U.S. and the U.K. barring companies in those countries from dealing with ZTE Corp. ZTCOY -9.76% will affect a wide range of buyers and suppliers , the WSJ’s Jason Douglas and Robert Wall report, while escalating a broader battle about trade and economic policy playing out on the international stage. ZTE made 43% of its revenue overseas, and U.S. officials are concerned about its big role in next-generation mobile-network technology, known as 5G. But companies including optical-component maker Acacia Communications and Oclario Inc. supply parts to ZTE, the world’s No. 4 telecom gear maker, and the WSJ’s Jacky Wong reports their stocks have been hammered since the ban was announced. Intel Corp. and Qualcomm Inc. also supply ZTE and have big stakes in the dispute.\nConcerns over the availability of low-sulfur shipping fuel to meet a global emissions-reduction mandate may start dissipating. Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM 0.82% is lining up technology and facilities to provide the fuel for maritime operators by January 2020, the publication Lloyd’s List reports . The assurance from a major fuel provider comes as the shipping world is preparing for a regulatory demand to lower sulfur content in fuel from the current 3.5% to 0.5%. Maritime executives say the mandate may cost the industry around $40 billion as operators either switch to new, more expensive fuel or retrofit older vessels with “scrubbers.” The vast majority of ship owners are opting for the cleaner fuel, but they’ve raised doubts about supplies. Exxon Mobil’s moves should soothe those fears, and the company says it will add bunkering locations to strengthen its assurances.\nE-COMMERCE Photo: Bloomberg News Sweeping aside more than two decades of sales tax law may not be so easy. Several U.S. Supreme Court justices appeared reluctant to overturn pre-internet precedent exempting many online merchants from collecting sales taxes, the WSJ’s Jess Bravin writes, despite broad agreement the explosive growth of e-commerce has made the rule “obsolete.” The judges heard arguments in a case brought by South Dakota and supported by states and brick-and-mortar retailers, who say internet sellers have an advantage since many fall outside state tax laws. Justice Sonia Sotomayor led the objections, arguing that throwing out a 1992 opinion that set the current tax rules would create “a whole new set of difficulties.” And Chief Justice John Roberts says the problem is fading as more online retailers set up physical shops, suggesting the court may not have to take any action at all.\nQUOTABLE\n‘ A supply chain is unique from one company to the next—whatever their particular pain points are, that’s where the technology comes in. ’\n—Cathy Roberson, a logistics industry analyst.\nNumber of the Day 23% Year-over-year decline in the average container shipping rate from Shanghai to Rotterdam in the second week of April, according to Drewry Shipping Consultants Ltd.\nIN OTHER NEWS The International Monetary Fund forecasts the global economy will grow 3.9% this year, the fastest pace since 2011 .
