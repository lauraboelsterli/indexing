Contribution Margin represents the combined performance of merchandising, marketing and credit management activities.\nAdjusted general and administrative expenses , as presented, is defined as general and administrative expenses adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, integration costs, restructuring costs, Orchard Portfolio segmentation and positioning research and other.\nAdjusted EBITDA , as presented, represents net loss before income tax benefit, interest expense, amortization and depreciation expense, loss on impairment, loss on servicing right, gain on debt extinguishment, stock-based compensation expense, integration costs, restructuring costs, Orchard Portfolio segmentation & positioning research and other.\nAdjusted free cash flow , as presented, represents net cash provided by operating activities, plus proceeds from the sale of customer accounts receivable, less purchase of customer accounts receivable and less maintenance capital expenditures.\nProgram agreement adjusted EBITDA , as presented, represents Adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, plus adjustments allowed for under Bluestem's Program Agreement including certain transaction-related expected cost savings, certain non-cash charges, certain one-time charges and expected cost savings reflecting the projected impact of cost synergies such as savings in headcount reduction, print and paper, transportation, credit operations and marketing and other. Other includes charges such as, but not limited to or necessarily inclusive of, strategic investments, system implementations and executive recruiting.\nLender adjusted EBITDA , as presented, represents Program agreement adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, less designated unrestricted subsidiaries, which consists of the subsidiary making sales for our PayCheck Direct business, and incremental expected cost savings as allowed for under Bluestem's lender agreements.\nLeverage ratio net debt , as presented, is defined as short-term debt plus long-term debt plus deferred charges and less cash and cash equivalents.\nProgram agreement leverage ratio , as presented, represents Leverage ratio net debt, as defined above, divided by Program agreement adjusted EBITDA, as defined above.\nLender leverage ratio , as presented, represents Leverage ratio net debt, as defined above, divided by Lender adjusted EBITDA, as defined above.\nWorking capital , as presented, is defined as total current assets less total current liabilities.\nAdjusted working capital , as presented, represents working capital, as defined above, plus the inter-company portion of current income taxes payable and inter-company payable due to stock compensation.\nProgram agreement net liquidity , as presented, is defined as cash and cash equivalents less third party credit card receivables (\"Lender cash and cash equivalents\") as defined by the lender plus availability under the asset backed line of credit.\nLender net liquidity , as presented, is defined as program agreement net liquidity, as defined above, less unrestricted subsidiary cash as defined by the lender.\nWe provide these measures because we believe they are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance and financial condition compared to other companies in our industry and to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance compared to term loan and program agreement financial covenants. As non-GAAP measures, they have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Bluestem's results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures should be considered along with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results reported in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our calculations of contribution margin, adjusted general and administrative expense, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted free cash flow, program agreement adjusted EBITDA, lender adjusted EBITDA, leverage ratio net debt, program agreement leverage ratio, lender leverage ratio, working capital, adjusted working capital, and program agreement and lender net liquidity may not be comparable to the
