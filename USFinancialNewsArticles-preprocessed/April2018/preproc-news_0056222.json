    "text": "- Phase 2 combination trial in two metastatic breast cancer (MBC) populations initiated for Merus’ most advanced bispecific antibody candidate, MCLA-128 -\n- Strategic collaboration announced with Simcere Pharmaceutical Group for multiple bispecific antibodies; expanded collaboration with Ono Pharmaceuticals for autoimmune diseases -\n- $55.8 million secured in private placement -\n- Company to host conference call and webcast today at 8:30am -\nUTRECHT, The Netherlands, April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Merus N.V. (Nasdaq:MRUS), a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company developing innovative bispecific antibody therapeutics (Biclonics®), today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017 and provided a corporate and clinical update.\n“The momentum that we have built throughout 2017 continues to yield meaningful progress for our pipeline of potential best-in-class bispecific antibody candidates,” said Ton Logtenberg, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Merus. “We already have had a productive start to the year with the initiation of patient dosing in a Phase 2 combination trial of our most advanced bispecific antibody, MCLA-128, in two metastatic breast cancer (MBC) populations and we anticipate formulating a clinical development path for MCLA-128 in certain of our other solid tumor indications among gastric, ovarian, endometrial and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Additionally, we anticipate milestones for our other proprietary programs, MCLA-117 and MCLA-158, during the year.”\n“We also are committed to expanding the potential of our Biclonics® technology platform and leveraging our highly productive functional cell-based screening of numerous combinations of Biclonics®. Our functional screening has allowed Merus to forge strategic collaborations with leading biopharma companies, including Incyte Corporation and Simcere Pharmaceutical Group, as well as to expand our existing relationship with Ono Pharmaceuticals. These agreements highlight the broad potential application of Biclonics® in immuno-oncology and autoimmune diseases.”\nRecent Clinical & Corporate Developments\nPatient Dosing Commenced in a Phase 2 Clinical Trial of MCLA-128 in Two Metastatic Breast Cancer Populations - Merus announced in January 2018 that the first patient was dosed in a Phase 2, open-label, multi-center international clinical trial to evaluate MCLA-128 in combination with current standards of care in two MBC populations, including HER2-positive MBC patients and hormone receptor positive/HER2-low MBC patients. MCLA-128 was advanced into Phase 2 following promising single-agent activity observed in heavily-pretreated patients treated in a Phase 1/2 trial.\nEntered Strategic Collaboration with Simcere Pharmaceutical Group for Three Bispecific Antibodies – In January 2018, Merus agreed to lead research and antibody generation of three bispecific antibodies utilizing Merus’ proprietary Biclonics® technology platform and granted Simcere Pharmaceutical Group an exclusive license to develop and commercialize in China those bispecific antibodies in the area of immuno-oncology. Merus has retained all rights outside of China. Simcere is responsible for Investigational New Drug Application (IND)-enabling studies and manufacturing of clinical trial materials in China, which Merus intends to use to assist regulatory filing and early stage clinical development in the rest of the world.\nMerus Entered into a New Global License with Ono Pharmaceuticals for Bispecific Antibodies Targeting Autoimmune Diseases - Merus announced in March 2018 that Ono Pharmaceuticals Co., LTD. exercised its option under an agreement executed in April 2014 to enter into a new research and license agreement utilizing Merus’ proprietary Biclonics® technology platform to generate a bispecific antibody that binds to a combination of targets designed for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.\nClosed $55.8 Million in Private Placement - In February 2018, Merus closed a $55.8 million private placement of 3.1 million common shares with a syndicate of new and existing investors, including Biotechnology Value Fund L.P. and certain of its affiliates, Aquilo Capital Management LLC, Sofinnova Venture Partners L.P., and LSP Life Sciences Fund N.V. Proceeds from the offering will be used to continue to fund Merus’ product candidates in clinical and preclinical development, as well as for general corporate purposes.\nIND Accepted by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for MCLA-117 and Merus Obtains Patent Issuance on MCLA-117 - Merus received FDA acceptance of its IND for MCLA-117 in February 2018 and the Company plans to open trial sites in the U.S. for its ongoing Phase 1 trial in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In March, Merus also obtained issuance of its first U.S. patent covering MCLA-117, and certain other Merus Biclonics® that engage T-cells with tumor cells by targeting CD3.\nMerus Prevailed in its Patent Challenge against Regeneron - In December 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit denied Regeneron Pharmaceutical Inc.’s request for a rehearing and rehearing en banc to reconsider its decision affirming that Regeneron engaged in inequitable conduct before the United States Patent and Trademark Office while prosecuting the U.S. Patent No. 8,502,018 (the ‘018 patent), which it had asserted against Merus. The decision to deny Regeneron’s request further validated the thorough opinions previously issued by the trial court and Federal Circuit panel on matters related to the ’018 patent.\nAnticipated 2018 Milestones\nMCLA-128, an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) enhanced Biclonics® that binds to HER2 and HER3-expressing solid tumor cells\nThe Phase 1/2 study evaluating single agent activity for MCLA-128 in gastric, ovarian, endometrial and NSCLC patients is ongoing and Merus expects to formulate its clinical development plans for certain of these indications based on emerging data from this study in the second half of 2018.\nMCLA-117, a Biclonics® that binds to CD3 and CLEC12A\nMerus is continuing its dose escalation of the Phase 1 clinical trial for MCLA-117 in Europe and the Company plans to open sites for the Phase 1 trial in the U.S. Safety and potential early activity data is expected in 2018.\nMCLA-158, an ADCC-enhanced Biclonics® designed to bind to cancer stem cells expressing Lgr5 and EGFR\nMerus has received approval of a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) in several European countries for MCLA-158 for the potential treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, including patients with the RAS-mutation, which represent a substantial unmet need. The Company expects to dose the first patient in the second quarter of 2018. Merus also filed an IND for MCLA-158 with the FDA in the first quarter of 2018 and plans to open trial sites in the U.S. in the second quarter of 2018.\nMCLA-145, a Biclonics® designed to bind to PD-L1 and a second undisclosed immunomodulatory target\nIND-enabling studies for MCLA-145, the first drug candidate co-developed under the Merus and Incyte global research collaboration, are ongoing. Merus has full rights to develop and commercialize MCLA-145 in the U.S. and Incyte is responsible for its development and commercialization outside the U.S.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nTotal revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was €3.8 million compared to €(0.4) million for the same period in 2016. Revenue is comprised primarily of the amortization of the Company’s upfront license payments from its collaboration agreements, research funding and income from research grants. The increase in revenue is primarily attributable to revenue associated with the Company’s collaboration with Incyte which commenced in 2017. Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was negative because the Company reversed €0.7 million of revenue that had been previously recognized in a prior period related to a government grant.\nResearch and development expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was €11.1 million compared to €6.5 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in research and development expenses reflects increases in clinical and preclinical development and manufacturing expenses.\nManagement and administration costs for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was €2.3 million compared to €2.7 million for the same period in 2016.\nOther expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was €2.8 million compared to €2.7 million for the same period in 2016.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, Merus recorded a net loss of €14.2 million, or €(0.73) per share (basic and diluted), compared to €31.9 million, or €(1.99) per share (basic and diluted), for the same period in 2016. The net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2016 includes a non-cash charge of €19.2 million for the accounting impact of a financial derivative related to the obligation to deliver shares to Incyte in 2017.\nFull Year 2017 Financial Results\nMerus ended 2017 with cash, cash equivalents and investments of €190.8 million compared to €56.9 million at December 31, 2016. Net cash used in operating activities was €37.4 million in 2017 compared to €25.7 million in 2016.\nTotal revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was €13.6 million compared to €2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Revenue is comprised primarily of the amortization of our upfront license payments from collaborations, research funding and income from research grants. The increase in revenue is primarily attributable to the amortization of the upfront license payment and cost reimbursements associated with our collaboration with Incyte which began in January 2017.\nResearch and development costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were €34.1 million compared to €18.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in research and development costs reflects higher enrollment in our clinical trials and expansion of research efforts to support our internal programs and collaboration with Incyte.\nManagement and administration costs for the year ended December 31, 2017 were €13.7 million compared to €4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in management and administration costs is attributable to increases in management personnel and associated share-based payment expenses.\nOther expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were €9.4 million compared to €7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in other expenses is primarily related to increases in consulting, accounting, and higher insurance and facilities costs offset by a decrease in litigation costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, Merus reported a net loss of €73.0 million, or €(3.80) per share (basic and diluted), compared to a net loss of €47.2 million, or €(3.57) per share (basic and diluted) for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net loss for 2017 includes several significant non-cash charges, including €15.8 million of unrealized foreign exchange results, €12.8 million of share-based payment expenses, and €10.7 million for the accounting impact of a financial derivative related to the obligation to deliver shares to Incyte.\nFinancial Outlook\nBased on the Company’s current operating plan, Merus expects that its current cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund its operations through the end of 2020.\nConference Call Details\nMerus will hold a conference call to provide a full year update and discuss its financial results today, Thursday, April 26, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. ET.
