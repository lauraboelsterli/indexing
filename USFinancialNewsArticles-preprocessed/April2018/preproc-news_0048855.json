    "text": "RESTON, Va., April 25, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ambassador Thomas Graham, Executive Chairman of Lightbridge Corporation (NASDAQ:LTBR), is scheduled to provide the annual international keynote speech to the Frankfort Kentucky Rotary Club, held in connection with Global Connections TV and the Kentucky World Affairs Council, entitled ‘Global Hotspots from North Korea to Iran.’ The presentation is scheduled for 7 pm on April 26, 2018 and will be syndicated to a variety of networks. A link to the event will also be posted to Lightbridge’s website after the event. Ambassador Graham plans to discuss new ways to address issues of nuclear proliferation, including the non-proliferation and safety benefits of Lightbridge’s advanced metallic nuclear fuel.\nGraham has a long history in nonproliferation, including taking part in every major nuclear arms control negotiation between 1970 and 1997 that involved the United States. He also served as President Bill Clinton’s Special Representative for Arms Control, Non-Proliferation, and Disarmament. In 2017, Graham co-authored with writer Scott Montgomery, “ Seeing the Light: The Case for Nuclear Power in the 21st Century ,” which lays out in detail why nuclear energy is not just an option but a necessity in the fight against climate change.\nGlobal Connections Television, which is a free public service with host Bill Miller, features in-depth interviews with leaders and officials from the United Nations, governments, private sector and civil society. GCTV episodes, which are privately funded and independently produced, are broadcast around the English-speaking world through cable, satellite, public-access television, and the World Wide Web.\nLightbridge is developing innovative metallic fuel designed to make both existing and new nuclear power plants more efficient and cost-competitive. Lightbridge launched a new joint venture, Enfission, in January to develop, license and sell nuclear fuel assemblies based on Lightbridge’s patented technology in partnership with Framatome, a leader in nuclear fuel, components and reactor services.\nAbout Lightbridge Corporation\nLightbridge (NASDAQ:LTBR) is a nuclear fuel technology development company based in Reston, Virginia, USA. The Company develops proprietary next generation nuclear fuel technologies for current and future reactors. The technology significantly enhances the economics and safety of nuclear power, operating about 1000° C cooler than standard fuel. Lightbridge invented, patented and has independently validated the technology, including successful demonstration of the fuel in a research reactor with near-term plans to demonstrate the fuel under commercial reactor conditions. The Company has assembled a world class development team including veterans of leading global fuel manufacturers. Four large electric utilities that generate about half the nuclear power in the US already advise Lightbridge on fuel development and deployment. The Company operates under a licensing and royalty model, independently validated and based on the increased power generated by Lightbridge-designed fuel and high ROI for operators of existing and new reactors. The economic benefits are further enhanced by anticipated carbon credits available under the Clean Power Plan. Lightbridge also provides comprehensive advisory services for established and emerging nuclear programs based on a philosophy of transparency, non-proliferation, safety and operational excellence.

These statements are based on current expectations on the date of this news release and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ significantly from such estimates. The risks include, but are not limited to, the degree of market adoption of the Company's product and service offerings; market competition; dependence on strategic partners; demand for fuel for nuclear reactors; the Company's ability to manage its business effectively in a rapidly evolving market; as well as other factors described in Lightbridge's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Lightbridge does not assume any obligation to update or revise any such forward-looking statements, whether as the result of new developments or otherwise. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on forward-looking statements.\nInvestor Relations Contact:\nDavid Waldman/Natalya Rudman\nTel. +1 855-379-9900\nir@ltbridge.com\nSource:Lightbridge Corporation",
