    "text": "NEW YORK (AP) â€” Facebook is asking users whether they think it's \"good for the world\" in a poll sent to an unspecified number of people.\nThe latest poll appears under the heading, \"We'd like to do better,\" when users log in. Possible responses range from \"strongly agree\" to \"strongly disagree.\"\nFacebook regularly polls users on its service. The latest comes as the company grapples with a privacy scandal and other troubles . Facebook did not immediately respond for comment\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg has said he wants to ensure that Facebook is a force for good in the world.
