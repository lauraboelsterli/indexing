    "text": "2018 First Quarter Highlights:\nFirst quarter net income of $14.9 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, up 29.2% from the prior quarter and up 7.8% year-over-year. Loans and leases receivable of $4.4 billion, up 10.0% in the first quarter on an annualized basis driven by new loan and lease production of $245.3 million; Loans and leases receivable up 11.9% year-over-year. Deposits of $4.4 billion, up 2.8% in the first quarter on an annualized basis and up 7.2% year-over-year; Non-interest bearing demand deposits increased 3.0% from the prior quarter and 8.9% from a year ago. Net interest margin was 3.70% compared to 3.79% in the prior quarter and 3.89% a year ago; Net interest margin in the prior quarter included an 8 basis point benefit from prepayment fees. Net interest income was $44.9 million, down 3.1% from the prior quarter and up 6.1% year-over-year. Return on average assets was 1.16% and return on average equity was 10.65% compared with 0.88% and 8.12%, respectively, for the prior quarter and 1.18% and 10.46%, respectively, a year ago.\nLOS ANGELES, Hanmi Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:HAFC) (or “Hanmi”), the parent company of Hanmi Bank (the “Bank”), today reported net income for the 2018 first quarter of $14.9 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared with $11.5 million, or $0.36 per diluted share for the 2017 fourth quarter and $13.8 million, or $0.43 per diluted share for the 2017 first quarter.\nMr. C. G. Kum, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “Hanmi’s first quarter results represent a good start to the year with strong loan production, expanding net income and continued excellent asset quality. During the first quarter, which is typically our seasonally weakest quarter, new loan and lease production of $245.3 million increased 21% from last year’s first quarter. This robust origination activity, which benefitted from our focus on C&I lending, helped loans and leases receivable increase in the first quarter 10% on an annualized basis and grow 12% compared to a year ago, while net income expanded nearly 8% year-over-year. I am also pleased that our net interest margin held relatively steady after adjusting for benefits in the prior quarter from prepayment fees. Importantly, credit quality remained excellent with nonperforming assets declining to 32 basis points of total assets in the quarter.”\nMr. Kum concluded, “During the first quarter, our Board increased the quarterly dividend 14%, to $0.24 per share. Hanmi remains committed to rewarding its shareholders and this dividend increase reflects confidence in our ability to continue generating profitable growth in 2018 and beyond.”\nQuarterly Highlights\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nAs of or for the Three Months Ended Amount Change March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, Q1-18 Q1-18 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 vs. Q4-17 vs. Q1-17 Net income $ 14,855 $ 11,500 $ 14,923 $ 14,457 $ 13,783 $ 3,355 $ 1,072 Net income per diluted common share $ 0.46 $ 0.36 $ 0.46 $ 0.45 $ 0.43 $ 0.10 $ 0.03 Assets $ 5,305,641 $ 5,210,485 $ 5,111,396 $ 4,973,346 $ 4,811,821 $ 95,156 $ 493,820 Loans receivable $ 4,413,557 $ 4,304,458 $ 4,195,355 $ 4,073,062 $ 3,943,951 $ 109,099 $ 469,606 Deposits $ 4,378,101 $ 4,348,654 $ 4,299,010 $ 4,259,173 $ 4,083,165 $ 29,447 $ 294,936 Return on average assets 1.16 % 0.88 % 1.18 % 1.19 % 1.18 % 0.28 -0.02 Return on average stockholders' equity 10.65 % 8.12 % 10.73 % 10.65 % 10.46 % 2.53 0.19 Net interest margin (1) 3.70 % 3.79 % 3.79 % 3.81 % 3.89 % -0.09 -0.19 Efficiency ratio (3) 58.36 % 54.16 % 53.33 % 54.74 % 54.95 % 4.20 3.41 Tangible common equity to tangible assets (2) 10.43 % 10.58 % 10.72 % 10.83 % 10.98 % -0.15 -0.55 Tangible common equity per common share (2) $ 16.98 $ 16.96 $ 16.86 $ 16.59 $ 16.26 $ 0.02 $ 0.72 (1) Amounts calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis using the federal tax rate in effect for the periods presented.

Results of Operations\nFirst quarter 2018 net interest income decreased 3.1% to $44.9 million from $46.3 million in the 2017 fourth quarter as the expansion of loans and leases receivable were more than offset by a five basis point decrease in overall loan and lease yields along with a five basis point increase in cost of deposits. Interest and fees on loans and leases for the first quarter decreased 1.2%, or $0.6 million, from the preceding quarter while interest expense on deposits increased 5.2%, or $0.4 million.

Net interest margin for the first quarter of 2018 was 3.70%, down 9 basis points from 3.79% for the fourth quarter of 2017, mainly due to higher interest income in the fourth quarter from end of year prepayment fees. Adjusting for this, net interest margin for the first quarter was relatively flat on a sequential quarter basis.\nFor the Three Months Ended (in thousands) Percentage Change Mar 31, Dec 31, Sep 30, Jun 30, Mar 31, Q1-18 Q1-18 Average Earning Assets and Interest-bearing L iabilities 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 vs. Q4-17 vs. Q1-17 Loans and lease receivables (1) $ 4,310,964 $ 4,227,259 $ 4,092,131 $ 3,951,934 $ 3,881,686 2.0 % 11.1 % Securities 588,738 611,181 611,538 585,384 526,549 -3.7 % 11.8 % FHLB stock 16,385 16,385 16,385 16,385 16,385 0.0 % 0.0 % Interest-bearing deposits in other banks 32,401 36,386 38,981 47,402 38,600 -11.0 % -16.1 % Average interest-earning assets $ 4,948,488 $ 4,891,211 $ 4,759,035 $ 4,601,105 $ 4,463,220 1.2 % 10.9 % Demand: interest-bearing $ 91,378 $ 90,646 $ 90,720 $ 93,873 $ 97,602 0.8 % -6.4 % Money market and savings 1,478,795 1,513,408 1,526,951 1,532,733 1,406,903 -2.3 % 5.1 % Time deposits 1,440,382 1,408,227 1,384,724 1,320,005 1,173,184 2.3 % 22.8 % Average interest-bearing deposits 3,010,555 3,012,281 3,002,395 2,946,611 2,677,689 -0.1 % 12.4 % Borrowings 179,000 119,946 67,935 20,000 270,500 49.2 % -33.8 % Subordinated debentures 117,323 117,198 117,065 116,850 30,950 0.1 % 279.1 % Average interest-bearing liabilities $ 3,306,878 $ 3,249,425 $ 3,187,395 $ 3,083,461 $ 2,979,139 1.8 % 11.0 % (1) Includes loans held for sale.

Gains on sales of SBA loans were $1.4 million for the first quarter 2018, down from $2.1 million from the fourth quarter of 2017 as the volume of SBA loans sold decreased to $19.2 million from $27.5 million for the preceding quarter.\nFor the Three Months Ended (in thousands) Percentage Change Mar 31, Dec 31, Sep 30, Jun 30, Mar 31, Q1-18 Q1-18 Noninterest Income 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 vs. Q4-17 vs. Q1-17 Service charges on deposit accounts $ 2,511 $ 2,729 $ 2,678 $ 2,461 $ 2,528 -8.0 % -0.7 % Trade finance and other service charges and fees 1,173 1,047 1,133 1,269 1,047 12.0 % 12.0 % Servicing income 662 799 625 644 564 -17.1 % 17.5 % Bank-owned life insurance income 277 282 260 286 285 -1.7 % -2.8 % Other operating income 285 404 328 896 877 -29.5 % -67.5 % Service charges, fees & other 4,908 5,261 5,024 5,556 5,301 -6.7 % -7.4 % Gain on sale of SBA loans 1,448 2,056 2,546 2,668 1,464 -29.6 % -1.1 % Disposition gain on PCI loans 133 91 979 540 183 46.2 % -27.3 % Net gain (loss) on sales of securities (428 ) 275 267 938 269 -255.6 % -259.1 % Total noninterest income $ 6,061 $ 7,683 $ 8,816 $ 9,702 $ 7,217 -21.1 % -16.0 % Noninterest expense for the first quarter increased 1.7% to $29.8 million from $29.3 million for the prior quarter primarily due to a $1.4 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expenses, partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease in other operating expense. Salaries and employee benefits expenses are typically higher in the first quarter due to the seasonal impact of elevated payroll taxes and employee benefits. As a result of the increase in noninterest expense, as well as lower noninterest income due to losses on CRA mutual fund sales and lower SBA gain on sale income, the efficiency ratio increased to 58.4% in the first quarter from 54.2% in the prior quarter.\nFor the Three Months Ended (in thousands) Percentage Change Mar 31, Dec 31, Sep 30, Jun 30, Mar 31, Q1-18 Q1-18 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 vs. Q4-17 vs. Q1-17 Noninterest Expense Salaries and employee benefits $ 18,702 $ 17,270 $ 16,947 $ 16,623 $ 17,104 8.3 % 9.3 % Occupancy and equipment 4,072 3,997 3,883 3,878 3,982 1.9 % 2.3 % Data processing 1,678 1,812 1,779 1,738 1,631 -7.4 % 2.9 % Professional fees 1,369 1,552 1,210 1,554 1,148 -11.8 % 19.3 % Supplies and communication 708 778 755 745 635 -9.0 % 11.5 % Advertising and promotion 876 988 1,147 1,015 802 -11.3 % 9.2 % Other operating expenses 2,273 2,961 2,955 2,881 2,070 -23.2 % 9.8 % subtotal 29,678 29,358 28,676 28,434 27,372 1.1 % 8.4 % Other real estate owned expense (income) 79 (100 ) (16 ) 510 (132 ) -179.0 % -159.8 % Total noninterest expense $ 29,757 $ 29,258 $ 28,660 $ 28,944 $ 27,240 1.7 % 9.2 % Hanmi recorded a provision for income taxes of $5.7 million for the first quarter of 2018, representing an effective tax rate of 27.8%, compared with $13.0 million, representing an effective tax rate of 53.2%, for the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result of the lower Federal corporate tax rate beginning in 2018, the provision for income taxes for the prior quarter included additional income tax expense of $3.9 million resulting from a one-time revaluation adjustment to reduce Hanmi’s deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate, before the additional income tax expense, was 37.5% for the 2017 fourth quarter.\nFinancial Position\nTotal assets were $5.31 billion at March 31, 2018, a 1.8% increase from $5.21 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase in total assets was primarily due to an increase in loans and leases receivable.\nLoans and leases receivable, before the allowance for loan and lease losses, were $4.41 billion at March 31, 2018, up 2.5% from $4.30 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase in loans and leases from the prior quarter reflects Hanmi’s continued strong loan and lease production. Loans held for sale, representing the guaranteed portion of SBA loans, were $6.0 million at March 31, 2018 compared with $6.4 million at the end of 2017.\nLoans and leases receivable, before the allowance for loan and lease losses, increased 11.9% from $3.94 billion for the first quarter last year, primarily due to strong loan and lease production over the last twelve months.\nAs of (in thousands) Percentage Change Mar 31, Dec 31, Sep 30, Jun 30, Mar 31, Q1-18 Q1-18 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 vs. Q4-17 vs. Q1-17 Loan and Lease Portfolio Commercial real estate loans $ 3,122,745 $ 3,069,063 $ 3,108,931 $ 3,068,069 $ 2,991,123 1.7 % 4.4 % Residential real estate loans 545,053 521,852 430,627 384,044 359,152 4.4 % 51.8 % Commercial and industrial loans 409,380 399,197 364,456 346,150 316,284 2.6 % 29.4 % Lease receivable 321,480 297,286 272,271 257,525 259,591 8.1 % 23.8 % Consumer loans 14,899 17,060 19,070 17,274 17,801 -12.7 % -16.3 % Loans and leases receivable 4,413,557 4,304,458 4,195,355 4,073,062 3,943,951 2.5 % 11.9 % Loans held for sale 6,008 6,394 6,469 10,949 8,849 -6.0 % -32.1 % Total loans $ 4,419,565 $ 4,310,852 $ 4,201,824 $ 4,084,011 $ 3,952,800 2.5 % 11.8 % New loan and lease production for the 2018 first quarter was $245.3 million while payoffs, amortization and net line utilization was $154.3 million compared with $262.4 million and $228.3 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2017.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets Ratio\nTangible common equity to tangible assets ratio is supplemental financial information determined by a method other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). This non-GAAP measure is used by management in the analysis of Hanmi’s capital strength. Tangible equity is calculated by subtracting goodwill and other intangible assets from stockholders’ equity. Banking and financial institution regulators also exclude goodwill and other intangible assets from stockholders’ equity when assessing the capital adequacy of a financial institution. Management believes the presentation of this financial measure excluding the impact of these items provides useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the capital strength of Hanmi. This disclosure should not be viewed as a substitution for results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.\nThe following table reconciles this non-GAAP performance measure to the GAAP performance measure for the periods indicated:\nTangible Common Equity to Tangible Assets Ratio (Unaudited) (In thousands, except share, per share data and ratios) March 31, December 31, September 30, June 30, March 31, Hanmi Financial Corporation 2018 2017 2017 2017 2017 Assets $ 5,305,641 $ 5,210,485 $ 5,111,396 $ 4,973,346 $ 4,811,821 Less goodwill and other intangible assets (12,454 ) (12,544 ) (12,628 ) (12,712 ) (12,797 ) Tangible assets $ 5,293,187 $ 5,197,941 $ 5,098,768 $ 4,960,634 $ 4,799,024 Stockholders' equity $ 564,278 $ 562,477 $ 559,247 $ 550,140 $ 539,542 Less goodwill and other intangible assets (12,454 ) (12,544 ) (12,628 ) (12,712 ) (12,797 ) Tangible stockholders' equity $ 551,824 $ 549,933 $ 546,619 $ 537,428 $ 526,745 Stockholders' equity to assets 10.64 % 10.80 % 10.94 % 11.06 % 11.21 % Tangible common equity to tangible assets 10.43 % 10.58 % 10.72 % 10.83 % 10.98 % Common shares outstanding 32,502,658 32,431,630 32,413,082 32,393,856 32,392,580 Tangible common equity per common share $ 16.98 $ 16.96 $ 16.86 $ 16.59 $ 16.26\nSource:Hanmi Bank",
