The plan has been undergirded by the commitment of Saudi Arabia—the de-facto head of OPEC—and Russia, the largest participant outside the cartel.\nOfficials from both countries are expected to discuss their intentions for the pact, which is set to expire at the end of 2018. A strong show of support for an extension of the deal could help raise prices further , report The Wall Street Journal’s Summer Said and Benoit Faucon.\nOIL EXTENDS GAINS \nOil prices turned lower Friday after President Donald Trump said high crude prices “will not be accepted.” \nMr. Trump’s comments, in a tweet, came as ministers from some of the world’s biggest crude producers reaffirmed their commitment to limiting output at a meeting in Saudi Arabia.\nICELAND EXAMINES TECH BOOM FUELED BY CHEAP POWER \nThe endless electricity demand from Iceland’s burgeoning data centers is forcing a reckoning with the island nation’s strong environmental ethos , reports The Wall Street Journal’s Zeke Turner.\n“Iceland’s Nordic climate and the geothermal steam rising from the tectonic fault line that runs beneath it provide two things the computers that run the world’s economy need in seemingly endless supply: cooling and electricity,” Mr. Turner writes.\nDEMAND FOR OIL IN ASIA SOARS \nAsian oil demand is set to hit a record in April, reports Reuters.\nSeaborne imports of crude oil by Asia’s main buyers will hit a record this month, with large percentage of that going to China, according to the news agency.\n \nShare this: Crude Oil energy journal Energy Newsletter OPEC Russia saudi arabia Previous WSJ Wealth Adviser Briefing: Retirement, Cryptocurrency, Weird LA Museums Next Energy Stocks Are Getting Pricey (Again)",
