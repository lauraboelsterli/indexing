Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to those is contained from time to time in the company’s SEC filings. Copies of each filing may be obtained from the company or the SEC.\nThe company refers you to the documents filed by the company from time to time with the SEC, specifically the section titled “Risk Factors” in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, as may be updated or supplemented in the company’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the company’s other filings with the SEC, which discuss these and other factors that could adversely affect the company’s results. The company disclaims any intention or obligation to update the , whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nNAREIT FFO : A supplemental non-GAAP measure utilized to evaluate the operating performance of real estate companies. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) defines funds from operations (“NAREIT FFO”) as net income/(loss) attributable to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), excluding gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and change in control of interests, plus (i) depreciation and amortization of operating properties and (ii) impairment of depreciable real estate and in substance real estate equity investments and (iii) after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures calculated to reflect NAREIT FFO on the same basis.\nThe company considers NAREIT FFO an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believes it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present NAREIT FFO when reporting results. Comparison of our presentation of NAREIT FFO to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs.\nFFO as Adjusted : A supplemental non-GAAP measure that the company believes is more reflective of its core operating performance and provides investors and analysts an additional measure to compare the company’s performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. FFO as adjusted is generally calculated by the Company as NAREIT FFO excluding certain transactional income and expenses and non-operating impairments which management believes are not reflective of the results within the company’s operating real estate portfolio.\nSame-Property NOI : A supplemental non-GAAP measure of real estate companies’ operating performance and should not be considered an alternative to net income in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of liquidity. The company considers same-property NOI as an important operating performance measure because it is frequently used by securities analysts and investors to measure only the net operating income of properties that have been owned by the company for the entire current and prior year reporting periods. It excludes properties under development and pending stabilization; properties are deemed stabilized at the earlier of (i) reaching 90% leased or (ii) one year following a projects inclusion in operating real estate. Same-property NOI assists in eliminating disparities in net income due to the development, acquisition or disposition of properties during the period presented, and thus provides a more consistent performance measure for the comparison of the Company's properties.\nSame-property NOI is calculated using revenues from rental properties (excluding straight-line rent adjustments, lease termination fees, amortization of above/below market rents and includes charges for bad debt) less operating and maintenance expense, real estate taxes and rent expense plus the company’s proportionate share of same-property NOI from unconsolidated real estate joint ventures, calculated on the same basis. The company’s method of calculating same-property NOI may differ from methods used by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs.\nCondensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands, except share information)\n(unaudited)\nMarch 31, December 31, 2018 2017 Assets:\nOperating real estate, net of accumulated depreciation of $2,440,836 and $2,433,053, respectively $ 9,362,899 $ 9,817,875 Investments in and advances to real estate joint ventures 560,068 483,861 Real estate under development 465,682 402,518 Other real estate investments 203,905 217,584 Mortgages and other financing receivables 21,376 21,838 Cash and cash equivalents 218,313 238,513 Marketable securities 11,627 13,265 Accounts and notes receivable, net 184,533 189,757 Other assets 344,099 378,515 Total assets\n$ 11,372,502 $ 11,763,726 Liabilities:\nNotes payable, net $ 4,597,967 $ 4,596,140 Mortgages payable, net 499,355 882,787 Dividends payable 132,209 128,892 Other liabilities 624,423 617,617 Total liabilities\n5,853,954 6,225,436 Redeemable noncontrolling interests\n16,146 16,143 Stockholders' equity:\nPreferred stock, $1.00 par value, authorized 5,996,240 shares 42,580 and 41,200 shares issued and outstanding (in series), respectively Aggregate liquidation preference $1,064,500 and $1,030,000, respectively 43 41 Common stock, $.01 par value, authorized 750,000,000 shares issued and outstanding 424,899,762 and 425,646,380 shares, respectively 4,249 4,256 Paid-in capital 6,164,185 6,152,764 Cumulative distributions in excess of net income (743,845) (761,337) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (66) (1,480) Total stockholders' equity\n5,424,566 5,394,244 Noncontrolling interests 77,836 127,903 Total equity\n5,502,402 5,522,147 Total liabilities and equity\n$ 11,372,502 $ 11,763,726\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of Income\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n(unaudited)\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Revenues\nRevenues from rental properties $ 230,415 $ 227,711 Reimbursement income 63,716 58,129 Other rental property income 5,586 3,551 Management and other fee income 4,361 4,197 Total revenues 304,078 293,588 Operating expenses\nRent 2,818 2,783 Real estate taxes 40,434 38,269 Operating and maintenance 43,331 42,574 General and administrative 22,398 22,230 Provision for doubtful accounts 2,131 1,404 Impairment charges 7,646 1,617 Depreciation and amortization 81,382 92,074 Total operating expenses 200,140 200,951 Operating income\n103,938 92,637 Other income/(expense)\nOther income, net 6,179 1,273 Interest expense (49,943) (46,482) Income from continuing operations before income taxes, net, equity in\nincome of joint ventures, net, gain on change in control of interests and\nequity in income from other real estate investments, net 60,174 47,428 (Provision)/benefit for income taxes, net (52) 493 Equity in income of joint ventures, net 16,913 14,733 Gain on change in control of interests - 10,188 Equity in income of other real estate investments, net 9,976 3,687 Income from continuing operations\n87,011 76,529 Gain on sale of operating properties/change in control of interests\n56,971 1,686 Net income\n143,982 78,215 Net loss/(income) attributable to noncontrolling interests 108 (1,482) Net income attributable to the Company\n144,090 76,733 Preferred dividends (14,589) (11,555) Net income available to the Company's common shareholders\n$ 129,501 $ 65,178 Per common share:\nNet income available to the Company: (2) Basic\n$ 0.30 $ 0.15 Diluted\n$ 0.30 (1) $ 0.15 (1) Weighted average shares: Basic\n423,404 423,381 Diluted\n424,521 424,146 (1) Reflects the potential impact if certain units were converted to common stock at the beginning of the period.
