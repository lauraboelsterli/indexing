    "text": "April 9, 2018 / 8:41 PM / in 8 minutes Backpage.com founders, five others indicted on prostitution-related charges Sarah N. Lynch 3 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Seven people associated with the sex ad website Backpage.com, including its founders Michael Lacey and Jim Larkin, are facing charges of knowingly facilitating prostitution as part of a 93-count indictment that was unsealed on Monday. An image of the current home page of the website backpage.com shows logos of U.S. law enforcement agencies after they seized the sex marketplace site April 6, 2018. backpage.com via REUTERS \nThe indictment, which also includes money laundering charges, was made public after Backpage.com and its affiliated websites were seized on Friday by U.S. federal law enforcement authorities and taken off the internet. \nLawmakers and law enforcement officials have long been working to crack down on the website, which was used primarily to sell sex and was the second largest classified ad service in the United States after Craigslist. \nBackpage and some advocacy groups have argued that the ads on the site were free speech protected by the U.S. Constitution. \nThe unsealed indictment, returned by a federal grand jury in Arizona, lays out details concerning 17 alleged victims, including both adults and minors as young as 14 years old, who were trafficked on the site. \nIn one case, a customer murdered one of the victims and attempted to burn her corpse, an official from the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Arizona said. Later, when the victim’s father tried to have his daughter’s pictures and ads taken down, the website did not immediately comply, according to the official. \nIn the indictment, the U.S. Justice Department accuses Backpage of earning $500 million in prostitution-related revenue since its inception in 2004, and of money laundering that entailed routing funds through seemingly unrelated entities, wiring money in and out of foreign accounts and converting it into and out of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. \nBackpage associates were also actively involved in editing ads and advising on how they should be worded, according to the indictment. \nThe indictment relies on the same law used in a similar case in California several years ago against the founder of MyRedbook.com, who pleaded guilty to charges that the website hosted ads largely posted by prostitutes. \nA Justice Department official said the case against Backpage does not rely on sex trafficking charges, but rather on charges connected to prostitution, which are easier to prosecute. \nTo prove sex trafficking, prosecutors would need to show each individual ad either involved a minor, or featured an adult who was selling sex through force or coercion. \nLast month, Congress passed legislation that makes it easier for state prosecutors and sex-trafficking victims to sue website operators that facilitate online sex trafficking. \nThe bill, which President Donald Trump is expected to sign into law this week, amends the Communications Decency Act, which largely shielded website operators from state criminal charges or civil liability if they were facilitating sex ads or prostitution. \nEfforts to get that law changed were featured prominently in a Netflix documentary called “I am Jane Doe.” Reporting by Sarah N.
