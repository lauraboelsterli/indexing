    "text": "9 COMMENTS LOS ANGELES—Lawyers for President Donald Trump’s personal attorney Michael Cohen asked a federal judge here Friday to halt a civil case against him in light of the criminal investigation embroiling him in New York.\n“We’re asking for a brief hit-the-pause button,” said Brent Blakely, an attorney for Mr. Cohen, referring to a suit filed in early March by Stephanie Clifford, a former adult film actress. Ms. Clifford, known professionally as Stormy Daniels, sued to invalidate a 2016 agreement which, in exchange for a payment of $130,000 , barred her from discussing an alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump in 2006.\nMr. Cohen made the payment using a Delaware company called Essential Consultants LLC, which is a named defendant in the case, along with Messrs. Cohen and Trump. \nThe hearing comes less than two weeks after FBI agents searched the office, home and hotel room of Mr. Cohen, carting away his files. Mr. Cohen is now under criminal investigation for potential bank fraud and campaign-finance violations in connection with the payment to Ms. Clifford and his taxi business, The Wall Street Journal has reported.\n“This case has exploded a little bit since the start,” said U.S. District Judge S. James Otero, who said on Friday he would later rule on the request. \nMr. Blakely repeatedly stressed to Judge Otero that his client doesn’t have his files because of the FBI raid and therefore can’t defend himself in the Los Angeles case. “They took everything, and still have it,” he said. \nHe urged Judge Otero to grant them a reprieve of 90 days or less to give them time to evaluate the criminal investigation. In light of the criminal case, Mr. Cohen will have to plead his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination in the Los Angeles case, his lawyer said. \nJudge Otero said he recognized the serious nature of the criminal case and the confusion that can stem from an FBI raid but found some “gaping holes” in Mr. Blakely’s arguments—including whether there’s enough overlap between the two cases to justify halting the Los Angeles proceedings. The judge also questioned why Mr. Cohen hadn’t filed a personal declaration with the court about his Fifth Amendment rights being compromised, and ordered his lawyer to file such a statement by Wednesday.\n“The breadth and scope of the criminal investigation is a mystery,” Judge Otero said, making it hard to determine how much it would impact the case in his courtroom.\nMichael Avenatti, an attorney for Ms. Clifford, said his opponents have filed “completely inadequate” evidence to request the case be suspended.\nBut the judge pressed Mr. Avenatti on why a delay would impact his client, since the judge said she doesn’t appear to feel hampered from speaking publicly even before a court invalidates her nondisclosure agreement.\n“She has told her story and continues to tell her story,” Judge Otero said, citing her appearances on 60 Minutes and The View. An attorney for Mr. Cohen said that Mr. Avenatti has himself made more than 50 television news appearances.\nMr. Avenatti responded that the agreement is held over her head “day in and day out” and she’s been threatened with millions in dollars of potential fines for speaking out.\nThe judge replied: “She doesn’t appear to be deterred.”\nMs. Clifford’s lawsuit followed a Feb. 27 emergency order from an arbitrator temporarily restraining Ms. Clifford from discussing her relationship with Mr. Trump or the nondisclosure agreement she reached with Mr. Cohen. \nLawyers for Messrs. Cohen and Trump have argued that Ms. Clifford could be liable for damages of at least $20 million for breaching the agreement. Mr. Avenatti has argued that the order isn’t valid.\nShe filed an amended complaint in late March accusing Mr. Cohen of defaming her in publicly portraying her as having lied about an alleged sexual encounter with Mr. Trump.\nJudge Otero said on Friday he would consider splitting off the defamation claim or finding another “less drastic” solution than completely halting the case.\nWrite to Sara Randazzo at sara.randazzo@wsj.com and Joe Palazzolo at joe.palazzolo@wsj.com",
