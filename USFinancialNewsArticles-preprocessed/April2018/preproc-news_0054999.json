Britain's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson leaves the Foreign Office in Westminster, London, Britain, April 26, 2018. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\nThe approval was done verbally on a non-binding motion, which does not require the government to follow its instruction, and only a fraction of lawmakers in the House of Commons took part in the debate.\n(This story changes wording to ‘approved’ rather than ‘voted in favour’) Reporting by Elizabeth Piper; Editing by Andrew MacAskill and Kevin Liffey",
