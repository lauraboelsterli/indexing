Scaturro has over 25 years of experience in providing high-tech services and solutions to government and commercial clients across the globe. As the CRO, he will be responsible for creating synergies and growth across Yorktel’s sales and marketing operation while reporting to the CEO on the health of the business and the customers as well as the probability of meeting revenue targets.\nKen Scaturro joins Yorktel as Chief Revenue Officer\nGreg Douglas to head up Government Markets for Yorktel\nScaturro’s appointment is part of a Yorktel expansion, designed to exponentially increase Yorktel’s sales and marketing efforts while enabling the company to enhance its focus on key market segments, including the healthcare and government sectors. To that end, the company has also announced that Greg Douglas will transition from his position as Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing to head up Government Markets.\n“We are extremely fortunate to be in a position to utilize both Ken and Greg’s considerable talents and expertise to support our continued growth and success,” said Ron Gaboury, CEO of Yorktel. “Ken is ideally qualified to ensure the long-term health and profitability of the business and there is no one better equipped than Greg to serve as the steward of what is essentially our heritage – the government sector.

Immediately prior to accepting the CRO appointment, he served as a Vice President of Sales for Condeco.\nYorktel has invested heavily in building its business in the healthcare sector recently, most notably with the launch of its Univago Healthcare Edition (Univago HE) platform. The company’s Strategic Account Sales, Enterprise Sales and Strategic Alliance divisions have also achieved considerable success through organic growth with the addition of numerous new accounts. As CRO, Scaturro will be responsible for optimizing efficiency and ensuring the continued growth across the business.\nDouglas has many years of experience in supporting the government sector, both with Yorktel and in his experience prior to joining the company.
