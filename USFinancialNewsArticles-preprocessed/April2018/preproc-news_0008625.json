    "text": "FREETOWN (Reuters) - Sierra Leone’s new President Julius Maada Bio on Thursday called on his rival in an election run-off to drop a legal challenge against the results, saying he could use his expertise and experience.\nSierra Leone's President Julius Maada Bio poses during an interview in Freetown, Sierra Leone April 5, 2018. REUTERS/Olivia Acland “I’ll very much encourage him to move away from that path and come,” Bio said of his rival from the former ruling party Samura Kamara, in an interview with Reuters.\n“He is a resource. He has the expertise and the experience. And I think we can put those to work in addition to all that we have to make sure that Sierra Leone is a better place.”\n ",
