    "text": "IRVING, Texas, April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- At a special meeting today, stockholders of La Quinta Holdings Inc. (“La Quinta” or the “Company”) (NYSE:LQ) approved the adoption of the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of January 17, 2018, as it may be amended from time to time, by and among Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (“Wyndham”), WHG BB Sub, Inc. (“Merger Sub”) and La Quinta. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub, a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Wyndham, will be merged with and into La Quinta with La Quinta surviving the merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wyndham. At the special meeting today, stockholders of La Quinta also approved amendments to La Quinta’s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to effect a reverse stock split at a ratio of 1-for-2 and to change the par value of the La Quinta common stock in connection with the reverse stock split from $0.01 per share to $0.02 per share.\nThe parties are actively working towards closing, and the transaction remains on track to close in the second quarter of 2018. In addition to La Quinta stockholder approval, the completion of the merger is subject to other customary closing conditions, including completion of the previously announced spin-off of CorePoint Lodging Inc. Upon the closing of the merger, the Company’s stockholders will have the right to receive $8.40 in cash prior to giving effect to the reverse stock split (or $16.80 in cash per share after giving effect to the reverse stock split), without interest (the “Merger Consideration”), for each share of common stock of La Quinta that they own immediately prior to the effective time of the merger. The Merger Consideration is in addition to the shares of CorePoint Lodging Inc. that our stockholders will receive in the spin-off of CorePoint Lodging Inc.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe foregoing contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend for these forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions of the federal securities laws relating to forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements relating to the expected timing, completion and effects of the proposed merger, separation and spin-off, as well as other statements representing management’s beliefs about, future events, transactions, strategies, operations and financial results, including, without limitation, our expectations with respect to the costs and other anticipated financial impacts of the spin-off and merger; future financial and operating results of CorePoint Lodging Inc. (“CorePoint”) and La Quinta Holdings Inc. (“La Quinta”); the ability of La Quinta, CorePoint and Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (“Wyndham”) to complete the contemplated financing transactions and reorganizations in connection with the merger and the spin-off; La Quinta’s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions with respect to future operations and services; required approvals to complete the merger and the spin-off by our stockholders and by governmental regulatory authorities, and the timing and conditions for such approvals; the stock price of CorePoint following the consummation of the transactions; the stock price of La Quinta prior to the consummation of the transactions; and the satisfaction of the closing conditions to the proposed merger and the spin-off.

Forward-looking statements are made based upon management’s current expectations and beliefs and are not guarantees of future performance. Such forward-looking statements involve numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such statements.
