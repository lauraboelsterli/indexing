Roberts, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Comcast Corporation, said, “Comcast NBCUniversal is off to a great start in 2018 with over 10% revenue growth in the first quarter. At Cable Communications, our steady increase in customer relationships continued, balanced with solid growth in EBITDA, reflecting momentum in our high-speed Internet and business services segments. NBCUniversal delivered double-digit EBITDA growth, fueled by impressive results at our Theme Parks, as well as our TV businesses’ successful broadcasts of the NFL’s Super Bowl LII and the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics. The Olympics were an incredible event that showcased our capabilities and collaboration throughout the company. NBCUniversal’s amazing presentation was the most comprehensive in Winter Games history with over 2,400 hours of coverage across broadcast, cable networks, and digital, and Cable’s best-in-class technology delivered an unparalleled viewing experience, resulting in 26% higher ratings among our X1 customers than the national average. I’m proud of our teams across Comcast NBCUniversal and believe we are well-positioned for the future.”\nConsolidated Financial Results\n1st Quarter ($ in millions) 2017 3 2018 Growth Revenue $20,587 $22,791 10.7 % Net Income Attributable to Comcast $2,573 $3,118 21.2 % Adjusted EBITDA 1 $7,010 $7,244 3.3 % Earnings per Share 2 $0.53 $0.66 24.5 % Excluding Adjustments (see Table 4) $0.53 $0.62 17.0 % For additional detail on segment revenue and expenses, customer metrics and capital expenditures, please refer to the trending schedules on Comcast’s Investor Relations website at www.cmcsa.com .\nConsolidated Revenue for the first quarter of 2018 increased 10.7% to $22.8 billion.

Cable Communications’ capital expenditures decreased 5.2% to $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting a lower level of spending on customer premise equipment, partially offset by increased investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity and increased investment in line extensions. Cable capital expenditures represented 12.5% of Cable revenue in the first quarter of 2018 compared to 13.6% in last year’s first quarter. NBCUniversal’s capital expenditures of $269 million decreased 5.6%.\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities was $5.5 billion in the first quarter of 2018.

High-speed Internet revenue increased 8.2%, driven by an increase in the number of residential high-speed Internet customers and rate adjustments. Business services revenue increased 11.9%, primarily due to an increase in the number of customers receiving our small and medium-sized business services offerings. Advertising revenue increased 4.9% due to an increase in political advertising revenue and higher revenue from our advanced advertising businesses. Other revenue increased 4.5%, driven by Xfinity Home and an increase in revenue from our X1 licensing agreements. Video revenue decreased 0.8%, primarily due to a decline in the number of residential customers. Voice revenue decreased 2.7%, reflecting a decrease in the number of residential voice customers.\nTotal Customer Relationships increased by 273,000 to 29.6 million in the first quarter of 2018.

Video programming costs increased 3.0%, primarily reflecting higher retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs. Non-programming expenses increased 2.8%, primarily reflecting increases in technical and product support expenses, advertising, marketing and promotion costs and other operating costs, partially offset by a decline in customer service expenses. This quarter’s Adjusted EBITDA margin was 40.1%, compared to 39.6% in the first quarter of 2017.\nNBCUniversal\n1st Quarter ($ in millions) 2017 3 2018 Growth NBCUniversal Revenue Cable Networks $2,640 $3,194 21.0 % Excluding Olympics (see Table 6) 2,640 2,816 6.6 % Broadcast Television 2,208 3,497 58.3 % Excluding Olympics and Super Bowl (see Table 6) 2,208 2,304 4.3 % Filmed Entertainment 1,967 1,647 (16.3 %) Theme Parks 1,118 1,281 14.5 % Headquarters, other and eliminations (80 ) (89 ) NM NBCUniversal Revenue $7,853 $9,530 21.3 % NBCUniversal Adjusted EBITDA Cable Networks $1,115 $1,268 13.7 % Broadcast Television 322 507 57.5 % Filmed Entertainment 371 203 (45.2 %) Theme Parks 397 495 24.6 % Headquarters, other and eliminations (186 ) (188 ) NM NBCUniversal Adjusted EBITDA $2,019 $2,285 13.1 % NM=comparison not meaningful. Revenue for NBCUniversal increased 21.3% to $9.5 billion in the first quarter of 2018, primarily driven by the broadcasts of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and the NFL's Super Bowl which generated an incremental $1.6 billion of revenue at our TV businesses. Adjusted EBITDA increased 13.1% to $2.3 billion, reflecting increases at Broadcast, Cable Networks and Theme Parks, partially offset by a decline at Filmed Entertainment.\nCable Networks\nCable Networks revenue increased 21.0% to $3.2 billion in the first quarter of 2018, primarily reflecting higher distribution and advertising revenue. Distribution revenue increased 20.8%, driven by the broadcast of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics, as well as contractual rate increases and the timing of contract renewals, partially offset by a decline in subscribers at our cable networks. Advertising revenue increased 19.6%, primarily due to the broadcast of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics. Excluding $378 million of revenue generated by the broadcast of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics, Cable Networks revenue increased 6.6% (see Table 6). Adjusted EBITDA increased 13.7% to $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in programming and production costs associated with the broadcast of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics.\nBroadcast Television\nBroadcast Television revenue increased 58.3% to $3.5 billion in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting higher advertising and distribution and other revenue. Advertising revenue increased 84.9%, primarily driven by the broadcasts of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and the NFL's Super Bowl. Distribution and other revenue increased 42.9%, due to the broadcast of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics, as well as higher retransmission consent fees. Excluding $770 million of revenue generated by the broadcast of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and $423 million of revenue generated by the broadcast of the NFL's Super Bowl, Broadcast Television revenue increased 4.3% (see Table 6). Adjusted EBITDA increased 57.5% to $507 million in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by increased programming and production costs primarily associated with the broadcasts of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics and the NFL's Super Bowl.\nFilmed Entertainment\nFilmed Entertainment revenue decreased 16.3% to $1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2018, primarily reflecting lower theatrical revenue. Theatrical revenue decreased 35.0% due to the higher number of films in last year's first quarter, including Fifty Shades Darker, Sing, Split and Get Out, partially offset by the performances of Fifty Shades Freed, Pacific Rim Uprising, Darkest Hour and Pitch Perfect 3 in this year's first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by 45.2% to $203 million in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting the decline in revenue, partially offset by lower programming and production costs.\nTheme Parks\nTheme Parks revenue increased 14.5% to $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2018 due to higher per capita spending, which benefited from the timing of spring holidays, as well as the continued success of Volcano Bay TM in Orlando, Minion Park TM in Japan and The Wizarding World of Harry Potter TM in Hollywood. Adjusted EBITDA increased 24.6% to $495 million in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses.\nHeadquarters, Other and Eliminations\nNBCUniversal Headquarters, Other and Eliminations include overhead and eliminations among the NBCUniversal businesses. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, NBCUniversal Headquarters, Other and Eliminations Adjusted EBITDA loss was $188 million, compared to a loss of $186 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nCorporate, Other and Eliminations\nCorporate, Other and Eliminations primarily relate to corporate operations, our new wireless initiative, Xfinity Mobile, and Comcast Spectacor, as well as eliminations among Comcast's businesses. For the quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Corporate, Other and Eliminations Adjusted EBITDA loss was $456 million, which includes a loss of $189 million from Xfinity Mobile and an increase in eliminations associated with the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics, compared to a loss of $183 million in the first quarter of 2017.\nNotes:\n1 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income attributable to Comcast Corporation before net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable subsidiary preferred stock, income tax benefit (expense), investment and other income (loss), net, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, and other operating gains and losses (such as impairment charges related to fixed and intangible assets and gains or losses on the sale of long-lived assets), if any. From time to time, we may exclude from Adjusted EBITDA the impact of certain events, gains, losses or other charges (such as significant legal settlements) that affect the period-to-period comparability of our operating performance. 2 All earnings per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis. 3 Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the new accounting standard related to revenue recognition. In connection with the adoption, we implemented changes in classification for our Cable Communications segment's Video, High-Speed Internet, Voice, Business Services and Other revenues and costs and expenses. In addition, the new guidance impacted the timing of recognition for Cable Communications installation revenue and commissions expense, and Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Filmed Entertainment content licensing renewals and extensions. These changes affected Operating Income and Adjusted EBITDA for Comcast Consolidated and the Cable Communications, Cable Networks, Broadcast Television and Filmed Entertainment segments. The adoption did not impact Consolidated Free Cash Flow; however, Cash Paid for Capitalized Software and Other Intangible Assets, and Changes in Operating Assets and Liabilities were affected. We adopted the guidance using the full retrospective method and all periods presented have been adjusted. To be consistent with our current management reporting presentation, certain 2017 operating results were reclassified within the Cable Communications segment. 4 Beginning in the first quarter 2018, we have implemented changes that simplify our definition of Free Cash Flow to the following: Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities (as stated in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows) reduced by capital expenditures and cash paid for intangible assets. From time to time, we may exclude from Free Cash Flow the impact of certain cash receipts or payments (such as significant legal settlements) that affect period-to-period comparability. Consistent with our previous definition, cash payments for acquisitions and construction of real estate properties are presented separately in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and are therefore excluded from capital expenditures for Free Cash Flow. Following this change, our new definition of Free Cash Flow no longer adjusts for, among other things, the effects of economic stimulus packages, distributions to noncontrolling interests and dividends for redeemable preferred stock and certain nonoperating items. The prior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect this change. See Table 5 for reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nAll percentages are calculated on whole numbers. Minor differences may exist due to rounding.\nConference Call and Other Information\nComcast Corporation will host a conference call with the financial community today, April 25, 2018 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET).
