FILE PHOTO: Air France logo is pictured at the Air France check-in at Bordeaux-Merignac airport, as Air France pilots, cabin and ground crews unions call for a strike over salaries in Merignac near Bordeaux, France April 7, 2018. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau In a statement on Sunday, the airline company said 65 percent of its long-haul and medium-haul flights will be carried out from the Charles de Gaulle international airport in Paris. Eight-five percent of short-haul flights will be guaranteed from the Parisian airport of Orly and other regional airports in France, it added. About 28 percent of the company’s pilots are expected to strike. One flight attendant in five is expected to walk out. The first round of the strike took place in February. Air France on Friday launched a new consultation period with staff members to try to end the dispute that has so far cost it 220 million euros ($270 million). Jean-Marc Janaillac, chief executive of the Air France KLM parent group and chairman of Air France, said it would be hard for him to stay in his post if the talks failed.
