    "text": "LONDON, April 19 (Reuters) - The Swiss franc fell to its lowest level against the euro on Thursday in three years since the central bank removed a currency cap in January 2015.\nThe franc, which has been gradually weakening against the euro for more than three years, briefly fell to a low of 1.20025 francs per euro. It last traded at 1.19875.\nSwitzerlandâ€™s currency has been weakening steadily in recent weeks as investors bet the Swiss National Bank will keep its ultra-loose monetary policy in place even as the European Central Bank moves to tighten.
