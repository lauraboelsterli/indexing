    "text": "(Reuters) - Slide Fire Solutions said on Tuesday it would shut down its website and stop taking orders from next month for bump stocks, devices that allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like a machine gun.\nThe move comes after the Justice Department proposed rule changes last month that will effectively ban bump stocks.\nMoran, Texas-based Slide Fire will execute all orders given prior to May 20, it said in a statement on its website.\nSlide Fire, which made the bump stock devices that were used by the gunman in the mass shooting at a Las Vegas music festival in October, was accused of negligence as well as design and manufacturing defects.\n“Bump stocks should not be available for sale to the general public, and they should never have been allowed to be sold. Bump stocks serve no purpose other than to create the functional equivalent of a machine gun,” said Avery Gardiner, co-president of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a gun-control group based in Washington, D.C. that had sued Slide Fire on behalf of victims of the Las Vegas shooting.\nThe deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, which killed 58 people and injured more than 850, made the Congress consider legislation that would regulate bump stocks.\nPresident Donald Trump signed a memorandum in February directing the Justice Department to make the regulatory change.\nSlide Fire had temporarily paused its sales following the Las Vegas shooting, but subsequently restarted it.\nReporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru and Ross Kerber in Boston; Editing by Amrutha Gayathri\n ",
