    "text": "Many would argue, however, that Amazon has been a positive for the postal service, which has suffered from bleak finances for more than a decade as other means of communication replace first class mail. \nStill, Trump categorized Amazon's relationship with the post office as a \"scam\" on Saturday. tweet \nThe president's extraordinary criticism of Amazon has also centered on the company's policy of not collecting state and local taxes from the vast majority of its third-party sellers. The practice, Trump alleges, puts \"many thousands of retailers\" out of business, unable to survive against Jeff Bezos' ever-growing consumer titan. \nThe president underscored his feelings toward the company in a tweet Monday morning, saying: \"Our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country â€¦ not a level playing field!\" tweet \nAmazon already collects state sales taxes on products it sells directly, but the company does not collect state sales taxes for its third-party platform outside of a handful of states. The third-party business represents roughly half of Amazon's unit sales, according to multiple Wall Street firms. \nShares fell last week after Axios reported last Wednesday that Trump was considering changes to the retailer's tax treatment, in part because of anger over how Amazon has hurt the commercial real estate industry because of its negative effect on brick-and-mortar retailers.",
