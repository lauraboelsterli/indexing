    "text": "Mike Minor allowed just one run on two hits over six innings, and Joey Gallo drove in two and scored twice as the Texas Rangers defeated the Toronto Blue Jays 5-1 on Saturday at Globe Life Park in Arlington, Texas, in the second game of a three-game series.\nThe temperature for the game’s first pitch was 42 degrees, 32 degrees colder than Friday’s series opener and officially the third-coldest start to a game in Globe Life Park history, which opened in 1994.\nMinor (1-1) struck out seven and walked just two — the first two batters he faced — in a 93-pitch stint. He retired 11 consecutive batters after those two bases on balls, setting down the side in the second, third and fourth innings.\nMarcus Stroman (0-1) took the loss for the Blue Jays, surrendering all five of Texas’ runs over 4 2/3 innings while giving up six hits, walking five and striking out three.\nThe Rangers got on the board in the second inning when Ryan Rua’s sacrifice fly drove home Gallo, who had walked to start the inning.\nTexas broke open the game in the fifth with four runs off of Stroman, and all with two out. First, Joey Gallo doubled to right field to plate Shin-Soo Choo and Rougned Odor. Jurickson Profar then doubled to right field as well, bringing home Gallo and chasing Stroman in favor of reliever Danny Barnes.\nBarnes promptly gave up a hard-hit grounder by Juan Centeno to the right side of the infield that was deflected into right field by Toronto second baseman Devon Travis, allowing Profar to sprint home from second base to push the Rangers’ lead to 5-0.\nToronto responded with a solo home run by Steve Pearce in the top of the sixth, the only run allowed by Minor in his performance on Saturday.\nElvis Andrus and Profar added two hits each for the Rangers while Toronto’s two hits came on Pearce’s homer and a triple by Kevin Pillar.\nSunday’s series finale will be a matchup of left-hander Jaime Garcia (0-0, 1.50 ERA) for the Blue Jays and left-hander Cole Hamels (1-1, 3.38 ERA) for Texas.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
