    "text": "April 26, 2018 / 12:09 PM / Updated 7 hours ago England's FA in negotiations to sell Wembley Stadium to U.S. billionaire Reuters Staff 3 Min Read\nLONDON (Reuters) - England’s Football Association is in negotiations to sell Wembley Stadium, the home of the national soccer team, to U.S. billionaire Shahid Khan, owner of the Jacksonville Jaguars.\nA spokesman for the FA confirmed on Thursday it had received an offer to buy the stadium and British media said the deal could be worth up to 1 billion pounds.\nUnder the plan, the FA would keep Wembley as the main venue for major matches, including England internationals and the FA Cup Final, but the national soccer team could play elsewhere in October and November due to clashes with the U.S. National Football League (NFL) season.\nIn a statement Khan said his bid was not a precursor to moving the Jaguars, who have played one home NFL game per season at Wembley since 2013, to London permanently.\n“For the Jaguars, it would deliver another - and very significant - asset and local revenue source that would further strengthen our investment in London,” Khan who is also the owner of English second tier soccer team Fulham, said.\n“Today’s news changes none of what we envision for the long-term promise for the Jaguars here in Jax, and it changes nothing as to the goals we have for your downtown.”\nBritish media reported that Khan, who is worth $7.2 billion (5.15 billion pounds) according to Forbes, is ready to pay more than 500 million pounds.

Slideshow (5 Images)\n“I think the signals of the Jaguars relocating to London are premature and very assumptive at this point,” he told Reuters.\n“Khan has invested a lot in the areas around the NFL stadium in Jacksonville with plans to develop even more around it, so it would be millions of dollars down the drain if the ultimate plan was simply to rip the team away as all of that comes to fruition. For now, I view it as just a value investment with a lot of potential return for Khan.” Writing by William Schomberg and Neil Robinson; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Toby Davis",
