The Frankfurt skyline with its financial district is photographed on early evening in Frankfurt, Germany, March 25, 2018. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/Files \nThe Economy Ministry said foreign trade was unlikely to make a significant contribution to growth. \n“The German economy remains buoyant and the upturn is continuing,” German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said in a statement, adding that employment would rise by one million people by 2019 while unemployment would hit a new record low. \nThat increase in new jobs combined with rising incomes means consumer demand will likely be strong, the Ministry said. It added that corporate investment would also remain dynamic. Reporting by Michelle Martin; Editing by Paul Carrel",
