    "text": "WASHINGTON, April 6 (Reuters) - There are ongoing talks on trade between the United States and China, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Friday but he did not specify at what level the negotiations were occurring.\n“There are ongoing talks. I don’t want to name names, I don’t want to put anyone on the spot, there are ongoing talks. They’ll be back and forth, U.S. and Beijing, and so forth,” Kudlow told Fox Business Network.\nHowever, in an earlier interview Bloomberg TV, Kudlow said discussions had not begun.
