Not only does the iTero Element scanner launch support the growth of our base Invisalign clear aligner business, but it also represents a major milestone for digital dentistry in China. We’re glad to take a leadership role bringing the latest and most advanced intraoral scanning technologies to the region.”\nAbout Align Technology, Inc.\nAlign Technology designs and manufactures the Invisalign ® system, the most advanced clear aligner system in the world, and iTero ® intraoral scanners and services.
