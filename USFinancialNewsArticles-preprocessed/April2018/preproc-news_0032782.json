    "text": "DOYLESTOWN, Pa., April 18, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Peter Marchesini, Chief Operating Officer of Alamo Pharma Services, Inc. (“Alamo”), recently participated as a “chairperson” of the “Patient Impact” tract panel discussions at the eyeforpharma 2018 meeting held in Philadelphia April 10-11. The annual gathering of more than 800 senior-level pharmaceutical executives encouraged inspiring and forward-thinking leaders from the pharmaceutical industry to share ideas, lessons learned, and case studies on how they have transformed insights from patients and customers into healthcare innovations.\nAs part of his role, Marchesini provided an opening address to the attendees that set up lively discussions on how to “strengthen relationships through partnerships and collaborations” and ways industry leaders can “demonstrate the impact of the clinical educator on adherence.” In these discussions, Marchesini and fellow presenters shared the importance of using real patient insight to influence decision making and promoting a patient-centric culture within their organizations.\n“Being a part of the Patient Impact section of the eyeforpharma 2018 meeting was both an honor and a valuable learning experience,” says Marchesini. “The speakers representing the very best of pharma, biotech, patients, patient advocates, and industry partners provided a great perspective and thought provoking discussions. I am proud to represent a company that thinks about the world from a patient perspective and brings this thinking to every client we have the privilege to support.”\nDuring his time with Alamo, Marchesini has utilized his more than 25 years of pharmaceutical leadership experience to guide the organization from inception more than seven years ago through today. He personally focuses on the business development and operational efforts of the company.

Known for his effective leadership style and strategic thinking, Marchesini was recognized in both 2009 and 2017 as one of the “PharmaVoice 100,” a selection of 100 most inspiring people in the pharmaceutical industry. He has great passion and talent for teaching and is part of the Rutgers University Pharmaceutical MBA program faculty.\nSome of the key takeaways of Marchesini’s eyeforpharma panel discussions include:\nPeter Marchesini, Chief Operating Officer of Alamo Pharma Services, Inc.\nThe importance of pharmaceutical companies establishing win-win partnerships with advocacy groups and patient organizations to help support patients and ensure the patient voice is heard The need for industry leaders, whenever possible, to establish the goal of having their companies become go-to trusted sources of information for patients by improving outreach to smaller sub-populations of patients and ensuring greater levels of support The necessity for companies to develop best practice examples of how to work with external groups while remaining compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and other regulations\nTo learn more about the eyeforpharma 2018 meeting, visit eyeforpharma.com/philly .\nAbout Alamo Pharma Services\nFounded in 2011, Alamo Pharma Services offers pharmaceutical and biotech companies vital solutions to bring their products to market efficiently and successfully.
