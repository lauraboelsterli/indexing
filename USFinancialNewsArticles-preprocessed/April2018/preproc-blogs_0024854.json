    "text": "The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said on Thursday the ride-hailing company Uber Technologies had agreed to expand its proposed settlement with the agency over charges it deceived consumers about its privacy and data security practices.\n\"I am pleased that just a few months after announcing this incident, we have reached a speedy resolution with the FTC that holds Uber accountable for the mistakes of the past by imposing new requirements that reasonably fit the facts,\" Uber Chief Legal Officer Tony West told CNBC.\nThe FTC said the expansion of the proposed settlement comes after the commission learned Uber had failed to disclose a \"significant\" breach of consumer data that occurred in 2016 and would compel Uber to disclosure future incidents.\nâ€”CNBC's Paayal Zaveri contributed to this report.",
