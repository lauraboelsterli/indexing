    "text": "Managing Director Thomas Livelli to Oversee Investment Activities in the Country\nCHARLESTON, S.C. & SANTIAGO, Chile--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Greystar Real Estate Partners, LLC (“Greystar”), a global leader in the investment, development and management of high-quality rental housing properties, announced today plans to open an office in Santiago, Chile. Managing Director Tom Livelli will lead the office and oversee Greystar’s real estate investment and development activities in the country.\n“Opening an office in Chile is a logical next step in advancing our international growth strategy. Establishing a permanent footprint in Chile, one of Latin America’s top economies, positions us well to further capitalize on the significant opportunities in the multifamily space across the Andean region,” said Bob Faith, Founder and CEO of Greystar. “Since entering the market last year with the launch of our multifamily development fund, we have deepened our institutional knowledge, cultivated important relationships, and identified new investment opportunities that we are actively pursuing.”\n“Tom’s extensive experience sourcing, structuring and underwriting multifamily real estate projects throughout Latin American makes him the clear choice to lead our operations in Chile,” said Bill Maddux, Executive Managing Director of Greystar and member of the Greystar Investment Committee, Operating Committee, and Board of Directors. “We see incredible opportunity for long-term investment in Chile and I look forward to working closely with Tom to capitalize on this exciting opportunity.”\n“The nascent multifamily industry across Latin America, and especially in Chile, presents many compelling opportunities for professional investors, developers, and operators like Greystar who possess critical know-how and have experience pioneering new markets,” said Tom Livelli, Managing Director for Greystar in Chile. “I am very excited to return to Chile, to spearhead Greystar’s continued growth in the Andean region, and to contribute to the evolution of Chile’s rental housing market.”\nGreystar announced the closing of Fondo de Inversión Credicorp Capital Renta Residencial I Chile, its first investment fund in Chile, with Credicorp Capital, the leading investment bank in the Andean region, in October 2016. The opening of Greystar’s Santiago office is a key part of the firm’s international expansion strategy and reflects Greystar’s confidence in the long-term potential of the multifamily market in the country. In partnership with Credicorp, Greystar anticipates raising a second Chile fund this year.\nChile is one of the most dynamic, open, and stable economies in Latin America. The country has the highest real per capita income in South America, creating purchasing power for renters who seek the personalized services and refined apartments that are emblematic of Greystar communities. Providing a tailwind for rental demand are shifts in demographics and housing preferences combined with a home price-to-income ratio in Santiago that exceeds that of other major global cities.\nMr. Livelli has been active in the multifamily industry in the United States and Latin America since 2006. Prior to joining Greystar in 2017, he was a senior vice president with Boston Andes Capital, a private equity real estate firm with offices in Boston, Bogotá, and Buenos Aires. Mr. Livelli was also a director of Clark Realty Capital, where he was responsible for the financing and development of large-scale mixed-use and residential communities in California and Central America. Mr. Livelli holds an honors degree in Environmental Science and Public Policy from Harvard University and received his MBA from the Stanford Graduate School of Business.\nAbout Greystar\nGreystar is a leading, fully integrated multifamily real estate company offering expertise in investment management, development and property management of rental housing properties globally.
