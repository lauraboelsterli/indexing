    "text": "April 18, 2018 / 11:05 AM / Updated 14 minutes ago Morgan Stanley profit jumps 40 pct on trading boost Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nApril 18 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley reported a 40 percent jump in quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by lower income tax rate and a rise in trading revenue due to increased market volatility. \nThe bank’s net income applicable to common shareholders rose to $2.58 billion in the first quarter ended March 31 from $1.84 billion a year earlier. \nThe company earned $1.45 per share, compared with $1 per share in the year-earlier quarter. \nAnalysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.25 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable. \nRival Goldman Sachs Group Inc posted a rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday, driven by gains in its trading business.
