    "text": "2 COMMENTS WASHINGTON— Yahoo Inc.’s AABA -1.43% response to a 2014 hack of hundreds of millions of user accounts drew a $35 million fine from regulators, the first time a public company has been penalized over its handling of a cybersecurity breach.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday that Altaba Inc., formerly Yahoo, failed to properly investigate the breach and consider whether it should be disclosed to shareholders. The SEC said the company knew within days of the breach that Russian hackers had obtained usernames, phone numbers, birth dates, encrypted passwords, and security questions and answers for at least hundreds of millions of users, and perhaps billions. Yet Yahoo didn’t disclose the hack until 2016.\n“The allegations in the complaint illustrate a complete corporate failure to disclose a data breach that was widely known and readily available in the company,” said Steven Peikin, co-director of the SEC’s enforcement division.\nYahoo sold its core internet business to Verizon Communications Inc. in 2017 for about $4.5 billion, renaming what was left as Altaba . The company now consists of huge stakes in publicly listed Chinese internet company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Yahoo Japan .\nAltaba neither admitted nor denied the claims. Attorneys for the firm didn’t return calls seeking comment. A company spokesman declined to comment.\nFederal law doesn’t require firms to tell shareholders every time a hacker penetrates their networks, but says companies can’t mislead investors about the scope of a confirmed attack and must tell them about events that are material to investment decisions.\nThe case is also notable because the hackers were associated with the Russian government, and some corporate groups have questioned whether fining a company such as Yahoo is tantamount to punishing the victim.\nThe Justice Department last year announced the indictments of two officers of Russia’s Federal Security Service for their roles in masterminding the hack, which penetrated accounts belonging to U.S. military officials and employees of firms in the banking, finance and transportation sectors.\nSEC officials said they understand that many large companies face a barrage of cyberattacks from sophisticated hackers. But the hackers’ motivation or their affiliation with foreign governments don’t excuse companies of reasonably dealing with the risk and responding to known breaches, they added.\n“The identity of the perpetrator of a hack doesn’t provide any insulation to a company from potential liability for failing to provide material disclosures to its investors,” Mr. Peikin said.\nYahoo was led by then-Chief Executive Marissa Mayer for five years, until the company’s sale to Verizon. Ms. Mayer took a pay cut in 2016 after an internal investigation found she failed to “properly comprehend or investigate” the breach. Yahoo’s board declined to award Ms. Mayer her 2016 cash bonus , and accepted her offer to forgo her 2017 stock awards, Yahoo said last year.\nYahoo’s top lawyer, Ronald Bell, resigned after the internal investigation.\nThe SEC said its investigation isn’t over, an indication that regulators could still bring charges against executives who allegedly mishandled the breach.\n“Yahoo’s senior management and legal teams received various internal reports from Yahoo’s chief information security officer stating that the theft of hundreds of millions of Yahoo users’ personal data had occurred,” the SEC said in the order. The executives failed to “properly assess the scope, business impact, or legal implications of the breach,” the SEC alleged.\nAs a result, for almost two years Yahoo continued to publish generic investor disclosures about the risk of being hacked when it knew that it had already been a victim of a significant breach. The filings “misleadingly suggested that a significant data breach had not yet occurred,” the order said.\nThe company also misled investors in 2016—by which time it had evidence that billions of users were probably affected—when it agreed to sell its digital media and advertising business to Verizon, the SEC said. Yahoo told investors in a July 2016 regulatory filing that it wasn’t aware of any security breaches “that could reasonably be expected” to have an adverse effect on its business.\nWhen the company finally disclosed the breach in September 2016, its stock dropped 3%, cleaving $1.3 billion off its market capitalization. Verizon renegotiated its deal with Yahoo after the disclosure of the hack, securing a $350 million discount on the purchase.\nIn November 2016, Verizon said it believed the breach didn’t hurt the loyalty of users, people familiar with the matter said. The next month, Yahoo revealed it had been hit with a different data breach in 2013 that compromised private information of more than one billion user accounts. Verizon later disclosed the 2013 breach affected all of Yahoo’s three billion user accounts .\n“This case…represents a very, very substantial shortfall in even the modest expectations of what companies should be doing in these situations,” Mr. Peikin said.\nWrite to Dave Michaels at dave.michaels@wsj.com",
