    "text": "Amazon.com wants to make it easier for developers to create projects based on the blockchain technology underlying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\nThe company's cloud computing division launched \"AWS Blockchain Templates\" on Thursday . The product gives users pre-set blockchain frameworks that support two versions of the technology: Ethereum and the Linux Foundation's Hyperledger Fabric.\nBlockchain eliminates the need for a third-party intermediary, such as a bank, by quickly creating a permanent, secure record of transactions.\nStart-ups and major corporations alike are working to apply the technology to supply-chain management, financial services, property records and many other industries. Bitcoin is the first application of blockchain.\nIBM , which also has a cloud computing service, is one of the leaders in enterprise blockchain development. The company reported $5.5 billion in revenue from cloud in the fourth quarter of last year.\nFor the same quarter, Amazon reported $5.1 billion in revenue from AWS. Jeff Bezos' company is set to report earnings Thursday, April 26.\nWATCH: Blockchain can reduce cross-border transaction times show chapters Moodyâ€™s: Blockchain can reduce cross-border transaction times 4:37 AM ET Wed, 18 April 2018 | 03:26",
