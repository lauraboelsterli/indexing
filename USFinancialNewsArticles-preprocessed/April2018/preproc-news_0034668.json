While the first quarter is typically a seasonally slower period for loan growth, production in the quarter was also unfavorably impacted by customers remaining cautious across our portfolios. Commercial real estate balances were lower primarily due to continued slow market conditions, heightened competition and elevated payoffs. In addition, commercial real estate balances reflected greater than expected run-off of the transactional portion of the New York multifamily portfolio. Despite the modest decline in loan balances for the quarter, given our diversified business mix and strong commercial loan pipelines at quarter-end, we remain confident the Company can achieve the annual growth goal provided in January. In addition, we are proud to announce our 25 th consecutive annual common dividend increase, which demonstrates our commitment to deliver shareholder value through a consistent cash return of capital.\"\n\"We continue to execute on revenue producing initiatives and synergies created by recent acquisitions,\" said David Rosato, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \"As such, we are pleased total revenues increased two percent on a linked-quarter basis driven by both higher net interest income and non-interest income. Net interest margin of 3.05 percent was down two basis points from the fourth quarter. This decline primarily resulted from the unfavorable impact of tax reform on our municipal bond holdings and tax-preferenced items in our commercial & industrial lending portfolio, as well as two fewer calendar days in the first quarter. These declines were partially offset by higher yields on new business and the upward repricing of floating-rate loans. While the first quarter is seasonally higher for expenses, total non-interest expenses increased only two percent from the fourth quarter, reflecting our continued focus on controlling costs.\"\nAs of and for the Three Months Ended\nMar. 31, 2018\nDec. 31, 2017\nMar. 31, 2017\nAsset Quality\nNet loan charge-offs\n0.06%\n0.08%\n0.03%\nto average total loans\nOriginated non-performing loans\n0.52%\n0.49%\n0.55%\nas a percentage of originated loans\nReturns\nReturn on average assets\n0.98%\n0.96%\n0.70%\nReturn on average tangible common equity\n13.8%\n13.8%\n9.6%\nCapital Ratios\nPeople's United Financial, Inc.\nTangible common equity / tangible assets\n7.3%\n7.2%\n7.4%\nTier 1 leverage\n8.5%\n8.3%\n8.5%\nCommon equity tier 1\n10.1%\n9.7%\n10.0%\nTier 1 risk-based\n10.8%\n10.4%\n10.8%\nTotal risk-based\n12.6%\n12.2%\n12.7%\nPeople's United Bank, N.A.\nTier 1 leverage\n8.6%\n8.5%\n8.9%\nCommon equity tier 1\n11.0%\n10.7%\n11.3%\nTier 1 risk-based\n11.0%\n10.7%\n11.3%\nTotal risk-based\n12.9%\n12.6%\n13.4%\nThe Company's Board of Directors voted to increase the common stock dividend to an annual rate of $0.70 per share.

Net income available to common shareholders totaled $104.4 million. Operating earnings totaled $104.4 million, or $0.30 per common share (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP). Net interest income totaled $295.8 million in 1Q18 compared to $292.3 million in 4Q17. Net interest margin decreased two basis points from 4Q17 to 3.05% reflecting: Higher yields on the loan portfolio (increase of ten basis points). Lower yields on the securities portfolio (decrease of two basis points). Higher rates on deposits and borrowings (decrease of six basis points). Two fewer calendar days in 1Q18 (decrease of four basis points). Provision for loan losses totaled $5.4 million. Net loan charge-offs totaled $4.5 million. Net loan charge-off ratio of 0.06% in 1Q18. Non-interest income totaled $90.4 million in 1Q18 compared to $87.3 million in 4Q17. Insurance revenue increased $2.9 million, reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals. Commercial banking lending fees increased $1.6 million. Customer interest rate swap income decreased $3.7 million. Bank service charges decreased $0.9 million. Net security losses of $9.8 million in 4Q17 include losses totaling $10.0 million incurred as a tax planning strategy in response to tax reform (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP). At March 31, 2018, assets under administration, which are not reported as assets of People's United Financial, totaled $23.6 billion, of which $9.0 billion are under discretionary management, compared to $23.8 billion and $9.1 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2017. Non-interest expense totaled $243.5 million in 1Q18 compared to $239.7 million in 4Q17. Operating non-interest expense totaled $243.5 million in 1Q18 (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP). Compensation and benefits expense, excluding $0.6 million of merger-related expenses in 4Q17, increased $8.6 million, primarily reflecting seasonally-higher payroll and benefit-related costs in 1Q18. Professional and outside services expense, excluding $1.0 million of merger-related expenses in 4Q17, increased $0.9 million. Intangible asset amortization expense decreased $2.8 million. Regulatory assessment expense decreased $1.3 million. The efficiency ratio was 59.4% for 1Q18 compared to 56.1% for 4Q17 and 59.4% for 1Q17 (see Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliation to GAAP). The effective income tax rate was 21.4% for 1Q18 and 27.8% for the full-year of 2017. The lower rate in 1Q18 primarily reflects the benefit from a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018.\nCommercial Banking\nCommercial loans totaled $23.3 billion at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $433 million from December 31, 2017.

(\"People's United\") results of operations in accordance with\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), management routinely supplements its evaluation with an analysis\nof certain non-GAAP financial measures, such as the efficiency and tangible common equity ratios, tangible book value per\ncommon share and operating earnings metrics. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide\ninformation useful to investors in understanding People's United's underlying operating performance and trends, and\nfacilitates comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. Further, the efficiency ratio and operating\nearnings metrics are used by management in its assessment of financial performance, including non-interest expense\ncontrol, while the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per common share are used to analyze the\nrelative strength of People's United's capital position.\nThe efficiency ratio, which represents an approximate measure of the cost required by People's United to generate a\ndollar of revenue, is the ratio of (i) total non-interest expense (excluding operating lease expense, goodwill impairment\ncharges, amortization of other acquisition-related intangible assets, losses on real estate assets and non-recurring\nexpenses) (the numerator) to (ii) net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (\"FTE\") basis plus total non-interest\nincome (including the FTE adjustment on bank-owned life insurance (\"BOLI\") income, the netting of operating lease\nexpense and excluding gains and losses on sales of assets other than residential mortgage loans and acquired loans, and\nnon-recurring income) (the denominator). People's United generally considers an item of income or expense to be\nnon-recurring if it is not similar to an item of income or expense of a type incurred within the last two years and is not\nsimilar to an item of income or expense of a type reasonably expected to be incurred within the following two years.\nOperating earnings exclude from net income available to common shareholders those items that management considers\nto be of such a non-recurring or infrequent nature that, by excluding such items (net of income taxes), People's United's\nresults can be measured and assessed on a more consistent basis from period to period. Items excluded from operating\nearnings, which include, but are not limited to: (i) non-recurring gains/losses; (ii) merger-related expenses, including\nacquisition integration and other costs; (iii) writedowns of banking house assets and related lease termination costs;\n(iv) severance-related costs; and (v) charges related to executive-level management separation costs, are generally also\nexcluded when calculating the efficiency ratio. Operating earnings per common share (\"EPS\") is derived by determining the\nper common share impact of the respective adjustments to arrive at operating earnings and adding (subtracting) such\namounts to (from) diluted EPS, as reported. Operating return on average assets is calculated by dividing operating earnings\n(annualized) by average total assets. Operating return on average tangible common equity is calculated by dividing\noperating earnings (annualized) by average tangible common equity. The operating common dividend payout ratio is\ncalculated by dividing common dividends paid by operating earnings for the respective period.\nThe tangible common equity ratio is the ratio of (i) tangible common equity (total stockholders' equity less preferred\nstock, goodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets) (the numerator) to (ii) tangible assets (total assets less\ngoodwill and other acquisition-related intangible assets) (the denominator).
