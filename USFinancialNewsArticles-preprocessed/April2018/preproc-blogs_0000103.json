    "text": "Snapchat’s making it easier to hang out with friends.\nThe social media service has altered its video chat function to let people chat with up to 16 friends at once—news the company hopes could turn its fortunes around.\nThe feature, which is scheduled to roll out worldwide Tuesday, will let friends video conference in live time with all of the lenses and filters the service is famous for (including transforming your visage into a dog or bunny or letting you appear to vomit a rainbow).\nSnapchat could use the boost. The company’s still reeling after a tweet from Kylie Jenner, suggesting that no one used the app any more, caused a huge dip in the company’s stock, costing it $1 billion in market value. Then, earlier this month, pop singer Rihanna called on fans to delete the app after it ran an ad she felt made a joke of a domestic violence incident from her past. Snapchat removed the ad, which was placed by a mobile-gaming company, and apologized, saying it was a mistake.\nThe two PR disasters follow a very disappointing IPO by the company last year.",
