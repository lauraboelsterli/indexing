    "text": "NEW YORK, April 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Loews Corporation (NYSE: L) today reported net income of $293 million, or $0.89 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $295 million, or $0.87 per share, in the prior year period.\nNet income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 decreased slightly as compared with the prior year period as lower earnings at Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP and lower parent company net investment income were mostly offset by higher earnings at CNA Financial Corporation and Loews Hotels & Co. The increased earnings per share reflects share repurchase activity in 2017 and 2018.\nBook value per share decreased to $57.48 at March 31, 2018 from $57.83 at December 31, 2017. Book value per share excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) increased to $58.78 at March 31, 2018 from $57.91 at December 31, 2017.\nCONSOLIDATED HIGHLIGHTS\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(In millions, except per share data)\n2018\n2017\nIncome before net investment gains\n$ 286\n$ 275\nNet investment gains\n7\n20\nNet income attributable to Loews Corporation\n$ 293\n$ 295\nNet income per share\n$ 0.89\n$ 0.87\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\nBook value per share\n$ 57.48\n$ 57.83\nBook value per share excluding AOCI\n58.78\n57.91\nCNA's earnings increased mainly due to improved P&C underwriting results and a reduction in the corporate tax rate due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\"). These improvements were partially offset by the decline in limited partnership investment results, higher adverse reserve development under the 2010 asbestos and environmental pollution loss portfolio transfer, and lower realized investment results.\nDiamond Offshore's results declined due to continuing depressed market conditions, partially offset by lower depreciation expense resulting mainly from asset impairment charges taken in prior years. In 2018, net earnings benefited from a favorable adjustment to an uncertain tax position recorded at year-end 2017 related to the Tax Act.\nBoardwalk Pipeline's earnings declined due to the revenue impact stemming from the restructuring of a firm transportation contract in 2017 as well as lower storage and parking and lending revenues. At the Loews level, these decreases were offset by a lower corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Act.\nLoews Hotels & Co's earnings increased due to improved operating performance at joint venture properties. Earnings also benefited from improved results at several owned hotels, primarily the Loews Miami Beach Hotel, and a lower corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Act. Results in 2017 included a $10 million net pretax gain on the sale of a joint venture property and the impairment of an investment in another joint venture property.\nIncome generated by the parent company investment portfolio decreased primarily due to lower performance from equity securities, partially offset by a lower corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Act.\nCorporate and other results improved before income tax in 2018 due mainly to income generated by Consolidated Container Company and the absence of transaction-related expenses incurred in 2017 related to the acquisition of Consolidated Container. The lowering of the corporate tax rate resulted in a slight deterioration in Corporate and other after-tax results in 2018.\nSHARE REPURCHASES\nAt March 31, 2018, there were 322.4 million shares of Loews common stock outstanding. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 9.9 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $497 million. From April 1, 2018 to April 27, 2018, the Company repurchased an additional 4.0 million shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $207 million. Depending on market conditions, the Company may from time to time purchase shares of its and its subsidiaries' outstanding common stock in the open market or otherwise.\nCONFERENCE CALLS\nA conference call to discuss the first quarter results of Loews Corporation has been scheduled for today at 11:00 a.m. ET.
