    "text": "April 26, 2018 / 9:53 PM / Updated 3 hours ago Woods says will play next two events on PGA Tour Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Tiger Woods announced on Thursday that he will play the next two events on the PGA Tour — the Wells Fargo Championship in North Carolina and the Players Championship in Florida. Tiger Woods of the U.S. hits off the second tee during final round play of the 2018 Masters golf tournament at the Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia, U.S. April 8, 2018. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\nThe Players Championship entry is hardly a surprise, given that he has twice won the tour’s flagship event, which is widely considered the most prestigious outside the four majors.\n“Break over. Time to get back to work,” Woods wrote on Twitter.\nThe 14-times major champion will have had three weeks off after a disappointing U.S. Masters, where he teed up amid massive media hype and perhaps unrealistic expectations.\nThe 42-year-old was one of the favourites after contending for victory at his previous two starts in Florida, but never quite fired on all cylinders and finished equal 32nd.\nHe has played six times this year on his comeback after a successful spinal fusion operation last April, with a tie for second at the Valspar Championship his best result.\nWoods last competed at the Wells Fargo in 2012, when he missed the cut. He won the event in 2007.\nHe won the Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass in 2001 and 2013. Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; editing by Ken Ferris",
