    "text": "1 COMMENTS A Primark store in London. The retail chain accounts for half of parent Associated British Food's profit. Photo: Bloomberg News \nU.K. fashion chain Primark will post higher profit margins this year on the back of favorable currency shifts and changes to purchasing policy, said John Bason, chief financial officer of the retailer’s parent company.\nPrimark accounts for about half of parent Associated British Food PLC’s profit and the fashion retailer is expected to boost its operating profit margin from the 10.4% recorded in 2017, Mr. Bason said Tuesday in an interview with CFO Journal. Primark’s profit margin slipped to 9.8% for the six months ended March 3, 2018, compared with 10% during the prior-year period, a sharp decline from its all-time high of 14.1% in 2006.\n“It does feel like a low point,” Mr. Bason said. “I expect margins to improve in the second half of the year.”\nABF reported profit of £491 million ($696.5 million) for the six months ended March 3, down from £646 million earned in the same period of 2017. Its revenues for the period totaled £7.4 billion, up from £7.3 billion in the same period a year earlier.\nFavorable trends in the foreign-exchange markets are expected to boost earnings. Primark generates the bulk of its revenues in pounds and euros, two currencies that have rallied against the U.S. dollar in recent months, reversing a prior decline.\nMeanwhile, Primark incurs most of its expenses in dollars, as the chain sources its garments from several Southeast Asian countries and pays for them in dollars, a common practice in the textile industry.\nChanges to Primark’s sourcing policies should also help to boost profit margins, according to Mr. Bason. “We are becoming more professional in our buying and focus on big suppliers,” he said. Primark now sources certain items from only one supplier, reducing the cost per item sold, he added.\nThe fashion chain places its orders six months in advance, resulting in a slight delay for the currency impact to show up in its bottom line.\nAn expanded retail footprint—Primark currently has 352 outlets, including eight in the U.S.—could allow the company to place larger orders with its suppliers, cutting down further on input costs, said Fintan Ryan, an analyst at Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG in London. “That would provide an upside to its margins,” said Mr. Ryan.\nPrimark plans to open several new stores this year, including two in the U.K., two in Germany and one in the U.S. The fashion retailer will open a store in Florida in 2019 as part of a £250 million expansion plan that began with the opening of a store in Boston in 2015.\nThe company is still “refining its model in the U.S.,” said Mr. Bason.\nPrimark is trying to find the right fit for its U.S. stores, said Alex Smith, an analyst at Barclays PLC. “The management went in with a footprint too large relative to the current brand awareness in the U.S.,” he said, adding Primark is now shrinking some of its U.S. locations.\nShare this: ASSOCIATED BRITISH FOODS PRIMARK Previous Middle-Market Private Companies Post Slower Earnings Growth Next The Morning Ledger: Companies Set to Spend on Higher Dividends, Share Buybacks  ",
