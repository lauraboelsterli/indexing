(OTCQB:TFVR) (the \"Company\"), d/b/a TeraForge, today announced entering into a agreement to purchase bitcoin mining equipment to be installed for Phase I of its operational strategy immediately at Colocation Guard ( www.ColocationGuard.com ) in Brooklyn, NY lead by Mr. Donald D’Avanzo, Director of Datacenter Operations.\nDonald D’Avanzo commented, “Phase I of Teraforge’s Bitcoin mining operation at Colocation Guard will focus on exploratory mining via application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips for approximately 60 to 90 days. The goal of phase 1 is to capture several data sets to be used for future growth and operational expenses determination. We will explore areas such as power, cooling, network latency and other environmental factors to see where we can be more efficient and pickup additional opex savings to be used to counter diminishing returns and/or negative cryptocurrency exchange valuations.”\nData Sets include, but not Limited to During Phase I:\nSupply chain & fulfillment Heat output in BTUs Cooling Tons needed per BTUs of heat generated Cooling types and their efficiencies based on different environmental factors such as outdoor ambient temperature and humidity Electrical cost per mining farm per month. Number of coins mined per month per “mining farm” ROI Projections\nDonald R D’Avanzo is a highly motivated and educated Information Technology Engineer with considerable experience in the sector. Driven to innovate and build more efficient infrastructure and cloud environments; he has been applying his skills to the datacenter, cryptocurrency mining and blockchain spaces throughout the United States and Canada essentially building what he likes to call a “better digital mouse trap” that costs less but is more efficient.”\nJonathan Read, Chief Executive Officer of TimefireVR, d/b/a TeraForge, stated, “After carefully evaluating several locations and teams to work with for our mining operation, we are pleased to move forward with Donald and his team in Brooklyn. We have purchased the equipment needed to begin mining and laid out a detailed multi-phase strategy. Shortly after the equipment is running, we will begin generating revenue immediately. Based on data and operational efficiencies, we will make further investment to increase our capacity. Additionally, we are actively exploring other locations, predicated on energy cost and availability of support services.”\nAbout TimefireVR Inc., d/b/a TeraForge\nTimefireVR Inc., d/b/a TeraForge, is an Arizona based technology company focused on strategic investments in blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies.
