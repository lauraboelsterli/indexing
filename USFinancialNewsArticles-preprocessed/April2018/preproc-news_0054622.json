    "text": "Pre-Tax Income up 23.6% Year-over-Year\nFirst Quarter Loan Growth of $23.3 Million to $665.2 Million\nHOPKINSVILLE, Ky.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- HopFed Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: HFBC) (the “Company”), the holding company for Heritage Bank USA, Inc. (the “Bank”), today reported operating results for the three month period ended March 31, 2018. For the three month period ended March 31, 2018, net income was $1.1 million, or $0.18 per share, compared to $935,000, or $0.15 per share, for the three month period ended March 31, 2017.\nCommenting on the first quarter results, John E. Peck, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are excited to report that loans grew by $23.3 million in the three month period ended March 31, 2018. Economic activity in our market remains strong, providing a robust pipeline of new loan opportunities. For the three month period ended March 31, 2018, net interest income was $7.2 million, an increase of $432,000 compared to the three month period ended March 31, 2017. On a linked quarter basis, our net interest margin improved to 3.45% from 3.41% despite the tax law change that reduced the tax equivalent yield of our municipal bond portfolio by 0.78%. We remain confident in our Company’s future earning potential due to our strong asset quality, the size of our loan pipeline and the strength of our local economy.”\nFinancial Highlights\nIn the three month period ended March 31, 2018, total loans increased $23.3 million, representing an annualized growth rate of 14.5%. At March 31, 2018, total loans originated and outstanding in the Nashville, Tennessee loan production office were $80.5 million, compared to $48.3 million at March 31, 2017. Non-accrual loans are $2.0 million, or 0.30% of total loans, at March 31, 2018, compared to $8.9 million, or 1.44% of total loans, at March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, the Company held 1,340,394 shares of treasury stock with a weighted average cost of $12.44 per share. The Company may purchase an additional 297,966 shares of treasury stock under our current repurchase program. In the three month period ended March 31, 2018, the Company purchased 2,034 shares of treasury stock at a weighted average cost of $14.14 per share. At March 31, 2018, the Company’s book value was $13.97 per share and the Tangible Common Equity Ratio was 9.49%. The Company’s book value computation does not include 423,679 unearned ESOP shares.\nResults of Operations\nIn the three month periods ended March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2017, net interest income was $7.2 million, $7.0 million and $6.8 million. The improved level of net interest income is largely the result of loan portfolio growth. For the three month period ended March 31, 2018, the average balance of net loans was $647.2, compared to $631.5 million for the three month period ended December 31, 2017 and $615.4 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2017.\nFor the three month period ended March 31, 2018, the Company’s non-interest income was $1.7 million compared to $2.3 million for the three month periods ended March 31, 2017. In the three month period ended March 31, 2017, the Company received $160,000 of tax free payment on a bank owned life insurance policy and $250,000 from a one-time reimbursement from a vendor. For the three month period ended March 31, 2018, service charge income was $706,000 compared to $804,000 for the three month period ended March 31, 2017, respectively. Beginning January 1, 2017, the Company revised our retail transaction account product offerings which reduced the amount of transaction accounts that were not being assessed a monthly fee. During the first six months of 2017, the Company experienced elevated levels of service charge income as a result of these changes.\nOn a linked quarter basis, total non-interest income declined by $124,000. The decline in linked quarter non-interest income was largely the result of a $95,000 decline in service charge income and a $55,000 decline in mortgage origination income due to increases in long term interest rates. The decline in linked quarter service charge income is largely a seasonal issue that occurs as consumer spending declines following the fourth quarter holiday season.\nFor the three month periods ended March 31. 2018 and March 31, 2017, non-interest expenses were $7.5 million and $7.7 million, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, the increase in professional expenses was largely the result of an $180,000 increase in legal expenses compared to the three month period ended March 31, 2017. The table below outlines the most significant changes in non-interest expenses for the three month period ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017:\nDollar Percentage March 31, 2018\nMarch 31, 2017\nChange\nChange\n(Dollars in Thousands, Except Percentages) Salaries and benefits $4,117 $4,236 ($119 ) -2.81 % State deposit tax 169 231 (62 ) -26.84 % Professional services 466 348 118 33.91 % Advertising 308 381 (73 ) -19.16 % Foreclosure, net (6 ) 108 (114 ) -105.56 % Other operating expenses 920 846 74 8.75 % This information is preliminary and based on company data available at the time of the presentation\nResults of Operations (continued)\nOn a linked quarter basis, the Company’s non-interest expenses declined by $266,000. The linked quarter decline in non-interest expense was largely the result of a reduction in legal expenses. On a linked quarter basis, salaries and benefits expenses increased $200,000, or 5.1%. The increase in salaries and benefits expense includes approximately $164,000 related to seasonal vacation accruals and $87,000 related to employee payroll expenses.

For the three month period ended March 31, 2018, a combination of reduced brokered deposits and loan growth resulted in $23.5 million reduction in cash balances compared to December 31, 2017. A summary of loans outstanding by type at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 is as follows:\nMarch 31, 2018\nDecember 31, 2017\n(Dollars in Thousands)\nOne-to-four family first mortgages $167,947 $163,565 Second mortgages (closed end) 1,181 1,184 Home equity lines of credit 34,261 35,697 Multi-family 37,977 37,445 Construction 40,484 30,246 Land 9,096 14,873 Farmland 34,830 36,851 Non-residential real estate 234,900 224,952 Consumer loans 8,514 8,620 Commercial loans 96,527 88,938 Total loans, gross 665,717 642,371 Unearned income, net of fees (539 ) (443 ) Less allowance for loan losses (4,654 ) (4,826 ) Total loans $660,524 $637,102 This information is preliminary and based on company data available at the time of the presentation\nAsset Quality\nFor the three month periods ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017, the Company’s net charge-offs totaled $239,000 and $238,000, respectively, or 0.15% of average loan balances.
