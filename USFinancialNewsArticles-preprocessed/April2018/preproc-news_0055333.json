    "text": "Published: Apr 25, 2018 3:32 p.m. ET Share Megyn Kelly reports for Fox News from the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland.\nBy Joe Flint\nMegyn Kelly was supposed to bring star power to NBC News and a bigger, broader audience of morning viewers to its “Today” show franchise.\nInstead, the three-year, $69 million bet to woo Kelly from her conservative prime-time perch at Fox News FOX, +1.72% is backfiring.\nSee: Fox News is less trusted than MSNBC and CNN, according to chart shown on Fox\nSince taking over the 9 a.m. hour of the lucrative morning show in September and rebranding it “Megyn Kelly Today,” Kelly has struggled to make the shift to daytime broadcast television, with its delicate balance of soft features and hard news. Her ratings declines and higher production costs have been a drag on a critical franchise for NBC CMCSA, +2.73% .\n“I need to introduce myself to people who don’t know me or know some bastardized version of me that they’ve gotten from a website or a TV show,” Kelly said in an interview. “There are definitely some who only know me through some caricature they learned about on ‘The Daily Show.’ ”",
