This inherent drive supports our business objectives of excellence in our core markets and of accelerated, profitable growth in new, adjacent markets. As BioSpin Group President, I am committed to these objectives and to continuing to deliver innovations and successful solutions for our customers, and value for our stakeholders.\"\nPrior to joining Bruker, Dr. Busse held successive leadership positions at Philips Healthcare, among them as Chief Technology Officer of the global MRI business, as well as General Manager of growth businesses in image-guided therapy and in data-driven radiology solutions.
