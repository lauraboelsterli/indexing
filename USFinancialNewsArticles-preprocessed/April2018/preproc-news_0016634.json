    "text": "Company Is Emerging Leader in Next Generation of Hotel Owners/Operators/Advisors\nOMAHA, Neb.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Scarlett Hotel Group (SHG), the next generation of hotel entrepreneurs that provides a full range of management, asset management and advisory services for third-parties and on its own behalf, today announced the company has acquired its third property, the 113-room Marriott Fairfield Inn & Suites Downtown Omaha in Nebraska.\n“We formed our company in 2017 to be in the vanguard of millennial entrepreneurs who will lead the hotel industry into the next generation. Our intent is to own and operate with a fresh new approach, using cutting edge technology and a culture-focused environment,” said Rob Sadoff, SHG principal. “SHG’s platform is to continue to grow in an aggressive manner without losing its start-up feel. All SHG team members have 24/7 access to all of the principals.”\n“We are always here for our team and will always pick up their phone calls,” said Andrew Scarlett, SHG principal. “My biggest pet peeve while working in operations was when my team felt instantly intimidated when ownership was present, and it’s great to see that we have created a culture where our team members actually look forward to our visits.”\nLocated at 1501 Nicholas Street, the custom-built, four-story hotel is near the TD Ameritrade Stadium, CenturyLink Convention Center and Arena, Old Market Historic District and Creighton University and within walking distance of Downtown Omaha’s numerous dining and shopping options. The hotel recently completed a multi-million renovation that upgraded all public spaces, including a completely revamped lobby and guest rooms.\n“This is our third acquisition and the first takeover of a hotel managed by a previous employer of ours. Because of our firsthand knowledge of these assets, we know what they are capable of and intend to take full advantage of their potential,” Sadoff added.\n“We seek to aggressively grow through all phases of the real estate cycle and have access to substantial capital for the right deals. We are ‘market-unistic’ and seek primary locations in secondary markets or secondary locations in primary markets,” said Zio Pekovic, SHG principal. “To date, we have acquired $55 million worth of hospitality estate and will continue on that trajectory for 2018. While we primarily seek acquisition candidates, we are equally interested in expanding our third-party and asset advisory business. We are an approved operator of all the major flags and have firsthand experience managing all property and segment types, from world-class resorts to independent boutique property’s. We have expertise in all aspects of asset management, as well as ground-up development and repositioning.”\nAbout Scarlett Hotel Group\nWith offices in Chicago and Nashville, Scarlett Hotel Group was founded by hotel industry veterans Andrew Scarlett, Rob Sadoff, Zio Pekovic and Louis Dodd. The company focuses on acquisitions, hotel management, sales and marketing support, F&B management and asset management, on its own behalf and for third-parties. In addition to the Fairfield Suites & Inns, SHG owns and operates the Residence Inn by Marriott Downtown Clearwater and the SpringHill Suites by Marriott Gainesville at the University of Florida.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180409005118/en/\nScarlett Hotel Group (SHG)\nChris Daly, media\n703-435-6293\nchris@dalygray.com\nSource: Scarlett Hotel Group (SHG)",
