    "text": "Missiles Strike Air Base in Syria \nApril 9, 2018 12:16 a.m. ET \nSeveral missiles hit a military air base in Syria early Monday, according to Syrian state TV, after an alleged chemical-weapons attack on a Damascus suburb killed dozens of civilians over the weekend and spurred calls for international action. \nPro-regime Syrian media said the direction of the strikes indicated Israel might be behind the attack, saying the Syrian military responded by shooting down eight incoming missiles. A number of regime troops were killed in the strikes, state media added. \nThe Israeli army early Monday declined to comment on the alleged attack, in line with its policy of neither confirming nor denying airstrikes in Syria. \nThe strikes appeared to have targeted the T-4 military air base in Homs near Palmyra. Israeli military in February accused the Syrian regime of allowing Iran to set up a base there in order to supply the Hezbollah militia with weapons. \nIsrael has repeatedly warned it won’t allow a long-term Iranian presence in Syria and is willing to engage in a conflict there to ensure Tehran doesn’t entrench on the northern Israeli border. \nThe strikes come a day after world leaders condemned an alleged chemical-weapons attack late Saturday on civilians in a rebel-held town in Eastern Ghouta outside Damascus. President \nDonald Trump \nsaid Syria would pay “a big price” for the alleged attack and vowed Sunday a “strong, joint response” with his French counterpart, \nEmmanuel Macron. \nIsrael has repeatedly warned it won’t allow a long-term Iranian presence in Syria and is willing to engage in a conflict there to ensure Tehran doesn’t entrench on the northern Israeli border. \nIt wasn’t clear whether Monday’s strikes were a direct response to the chemical attack. Pentagon officials said the U.S. hadn’t launched any strikes against Syria. \nIsraeli officials had earlier reacted negatively to the chemical attack in Syria. Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman on Sunday warned that Israel would have to act alone in the Middle East, given the signs in recent weeks that Mr. Trump aimed to pull U.S. troops from the Syrian conflict. \nSyrian media said loud explosions were heard in Homs after jets entered Syria from Lebanon. Footage on social media early Monday appeared to show planes crossing loudly through the airspace of Lebanon, which neighbors Israel and Syria. Lebanese officials weren’t immediately available for comment. \nIsrael in February said the site targeted Monday was an air base operated by Iran and its proxies, after the Israeli army shot down an Iranian drone that it said had originated at the base. \nAfter Israel downed the drone, it launched major airstrikes on targets in Syria, drawing antiaircraft fire from Syrian batteries that in turn shot down an Israeli fighter jet. \nIsrael in September also targeted a facility in Syria that was believed to be a factory where the regime produced chemical weapons, according to former Israeli officials. — Nour Al Akraa, Dov Lieber, Asa Fitch and Dion Nissenbaum contributed to this article. \nCorrections & Amplifications It wasn’t clear whether Monday’s strikes were a direct response to the chemical attack. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the strikes were on Sunday.
