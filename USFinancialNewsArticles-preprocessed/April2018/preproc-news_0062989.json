    "text": "Retail Report U.S. argues AT&T is hiding the real consumer impact of the Time Warner deal The Justice Department said AT&T sought to hide the high cost to consumers of its $85-billion deal to buy Time Warner. The Justice Department sued to block the deal, saying it would lead to higher prices for rival pay-TV companies. The trial will determine if the wireless giant will be allowed to buy the movie and TV show maker. Published 10 Hours Ago Reuters Joshua Roberts | Reuters Chief Executive Officer of AT&T Randall Stephenson (L) and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Time Warner Jeffrey Bewkes listen to testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee Antitrust Subcommittee hearing on the proposed deal between AT&T and Time Warner in Washington, U.S., December 7, 2016.\nAT&T sought to hide the high cost to consumers of its $85-billion deal to buy movie and TV producer Time Warner , the Justice Department said in its closing arguments on Monday as the United States tried to block the deal in court.\nThe Justice Department's Craig Conrath told a court that AT&T's Chief Executive Randall Stephenson, who said it was absurd that they would withhold content from competitors, also wrote an email to Time Warner's chief executive Jeff Bewkes to complain after Time Warner took a stake in Hulu, a cheaper online competitor.\n\"'Its hard to imagine how it wont impact all of our relationships,\"' Conrath quoted Stephenson as writing.\nThe judge's decision, which is expected in several weeks, will guide dealmakers on how aggressive they can be in buying suppliers in what is known among antitrust people as a vertical merger. Until this tie-up, vertical deals were largely considered approvable by regulators.\nThe government has argued that AT&T viewed the merger as a way to convince viewers to stick with pay TV instead of moving to cheaper online providers.\nConrath said that AT&T, which has 25 million pay TV subscribers through DirecTV, \"wanted to preserve that 'cash cow' for as long as they can.\"\nAT&T's satellite television service DirecTV lost 187,000 traditional U.S. video customers in the first quarter of 2018.\nConrath added that it was impractical and unrealistic to expect that AT&T would resist the temptation to use Time Warner content to help DirecTV.\nHe reiterated that the merger would cost consumers hundreds of millions of dollars a year in higher pay-TV fees, adding that AT&Ts claims of cost savings through efficiencies were unsupported numbers with no data to back them up.\nTwo key witnesses at the trial were Stephenson and Bewkes, who is retiring if the transaction goes through.\nThe two executives argued earlier in the trial that marrying AT&T's granular information about customers with Time Warner's ability to create compelling video would allow the merged company to advertise more effectively, giving it a fighting chance to compete with internet advertising titans like Facebook and Alphabet's Google.\nThey also denied that AT&T would be reluctant to license Time Warner content like CNN or March Madness basketball to pay-TV rivals or to cheaper online video companies - a key government argument.\nIn hopes of preventing a court fight, AT&T proposed that for seven years it would submit to third-party arbitration any disagreement with distributors over the pricing for Time Warner's networks and promise not to black out programming during arbitration.\nBut smaller pay TV rivals called as government witnesses argued that this was inadequate. Warren Schlichting, group president of Dish Network's Sling TV, argued that AT&T's offer was inadequate because it was limited to 7 years and HBO was not part of the proposal. Related Securities ",
