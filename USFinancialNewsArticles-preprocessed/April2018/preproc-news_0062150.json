    "text": "3 COMMENTS T-Mobile and Sprint, the U.S.’s third- and fourth-largest wireless carriers, have finally inked a merger , after four years of twists and turns. For SoftBank , Sprint’s controlling shareholder, the $26 billion deal is a case of better-late-than-never, coming about six months after the two companies officially called off previous talks.\nThe bumpy journey to this point, though, has highlighted the risks of investing in the Japanese technology conglomerate and its mercurial chairman Masayoshi Son.\nThe previous run at a Sprint-T-Mobile combination foundered last autumn largely because of Mr. Son’s determination not to give up control of Sprint. His flip-flopping now has cost both Sprint and SoftBank shareholders. Assuming a deal had been done on the current terms just before reports emerged that the deal had been canceled in late October, Sprint’s shareholders would have ended up with 30% of the combined company, rather than 27% now—a 10% difference. Since then, Sprint’s shares have fallen 7% while T-Mobile’s are up 3%.\nThe irony is that a deal has made strategic sense all along, assuming regulators can be placated—a combined company will compete better against the two companies’ bigger U.S. rivals, AT&T and Verizon. Sprint and T-Mobile expect the deal to bring cost synergies with a net present value of more than $43 billion. SoftBank will have the added benefit of de-consolidating Sprint’s net debt —more than $32 billion as of Dec. 31—from its books, while gaining a stake in a combined company that should be more profitable and have better cash flows. Even better, this deal will mean SoftBank won’t have to finance Sprint’s future investments in next-generation networks .\nSoftBank Chairman Masayoshi Son in Tokyo, earlier this year.

The Japanese giant now trades at a 44% discount to its three largest listed investments —Sprint, its 26% stake in Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba and a 43% stake in web portal Yahoo Japan : That’s very close to the widest that discount has ever reached.\nSoftBank’s investors have, for years, put their faith in Mr. Son, trusting in his ability to spot the next Alibaba. These days, though, they are paying a price for his fickle deal-making style.\nThe U.S. wireless industry is dominated by four major players: Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and Sprint. Now that just about everyone has a cellphone, each operator is looking for new ways to grow. But how did we go from the days of one giant landline monopoly to four competitive cell companies?
