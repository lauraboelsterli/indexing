Triathlon - Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games - Mixed Team Relay Final - Southport Broadwater Parklands - Gold Coast, Australia - April 7, 2018. Alistair Brownlee, Jonathan Brownlee, Vicky Holland and Jessica Learmonth of England celebrate after crossing the finish line in second place. REUTERS/David Gray \nGentile gave Jake Birtwhistle a 40-second buffer over Alistair Brownlee that the individual silver medallist held to give their team, which also included Gillian Backhouse and Matt Hauser, the gold. \nEach of the two male and two female competitors completed a 250-metre swim, seven kilometre bike ride and 1,500-metre run in the race. \nHauser and Jonny Brownlee had been locked together at the halfway stage before Gentile put pressure on Learmonth to open up the gap they needed. \nAustralia finished in a combined time of one hour, 17 minutes and 36 seconds, with Alistair Brownlee crossing the line 52 seconds later. New Zealand clinched bronze in a time of 1:19.28. Reporting by Greg Stutchbury; Editing by Sudipto Ganguly",
