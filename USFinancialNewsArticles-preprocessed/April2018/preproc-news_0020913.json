    "text": "PARIS (Reuters) - Air France KLM said on Tuesday that strikes by staff members protesting over wage demands had so far had a negative impact of 170 million euros ($209 million) on the airline.\nThe logo of Air France-KLM is seen during the company's 2014 First-Half results presentation in Paris July 25, 2014. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier Air France KLM said that this estimate concerned strikes held between the February 22 and April 11 period, with further protests planned for this month.\nAir France unions have been protesting after management rejected their demands for a six percent wage increase.\nThe airline’s disruption has coincided with strikes by the state-owned railway company SNCF, which has led to widespread travel chaos in France over the last month.\nSNCF’s chairman said on Monday that state railways had lost around 100 million euros ($123 million) since railway strikes began on April 3.\nFrench labor unions have not shown any sign of faltering in their test of President Emmanuel Macron’s resolve to shake up the domestic rail monopoly and deliver a raft of reforms he says are vital to economic modernization.\nReporting by Benoit Van Overstraeten and Sudip Kar-Gupta; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
