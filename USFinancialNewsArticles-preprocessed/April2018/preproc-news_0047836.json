    "text": "53 COMMENTS Toronto\nTo call Monday an unusual day here would be an understatement. Ten people were killed and 15 injured when the driver of a rented van began mowing down pedestrians. The horrifying attack shocked all Canadians, but especially those in the city sometimes called Toronto the Good. As Mayor John Tory emphasized in a news conference: “We are admired around the world for being inclusive and for being accepting and understanding and considerate.” But the reality is that even in the most tolerant of cities, intolerance exists and cannot be ignored.\nI was born and raised in Toronto. My family and I live fairly close to the area, near Yonge Street and Finch Avenue, where the attack occurred. It features many restaurants, stores and entertainment venues. After a long winter, the first nice day of spring had brought people out in droves. The sight of sidewalks littered with red body bags will not be easily forgotten.\nThe 2014 shooting at Ottawa’s Parliament Hill was the first true homegrown terrorist attack on Canadian soil. The motives of the alleged van driver, a 25-year-old software developer named Alek Minassian, are not yet known. But Monday’s attack resembled the vehicular terrorism in Europe: Nantes, France (2014), Nice, France (2016), and Berlin (2016). All three of those drivers were supporters of Islamic State, fueling speculation that Islamic terrorism had come to Toronto.\nMr. Minassian was apparently not known to police. He had praised Elliot Rodger, the 2014 mass shooter in Isla Vista, Calif., on Facebook . He claimed to be part of the so-called involuntary-celibate movement, or Incel. Constable Ken Lam of the Toronto Police Service heroically captured Mr. Minassian without firing a bullet. During their brief standoff, Mr. Minassian supposedly begged the officer to “kill me.”\nToronto has its share of petty and violent crime, but the robbery and homicide rates are exceedingly low compared with most major cities. The Economist’s 2017 study of 60 cities ranked Toronto as North America’s safest city and the fourth-safest in the world.\nEven so, Toronto has been a target of terror before. In 1991, five Muslim men with ties to the Pakistani movement Jamaat ul-Fuqraa’ were arrested for plotting to bomb the India Centre cinema and Vishnu Hindu temple. In 2006, a group of adults and teenagers known as the Toronto 18 were arrested for a plan to bomb the Canadian Parliament and behead then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper.\nToday Torontonians are shaken, but we remain proud, confident and resilient. Monday’s attack is a clear reminder that even—or perhaps especially—an open and tolerant city can’t take safety and security for granted. Vigilance is always required. But there’s no question Toronto the Good will remain a great place to live.\nMr. Taube, a Troy Media columnist, was a speechwriter for former Prime Minister Stephen Harper.",
