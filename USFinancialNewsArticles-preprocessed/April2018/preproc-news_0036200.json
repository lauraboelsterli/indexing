    "text": "April 17, 2018 / 12:39 AM / Updated 31 minutes ago U.S., Europe shares climb as dollar recovers on data Hilary Russ 4 Min Read \nNEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. and European shares climbed on Tuesday on corporate results and a renewed appetite for risk, while the dollar climbed off a two-week low and 2-year Treasury yields touched a decade high after economic data supported expectations of further rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo \nRobust earnings from Netflix ( NFLX.O ), Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and healthcare companies drove gains on Wall Street and boosted optimism about what is expected to be the strongest earnings season in seven years.[.N] \nS&P 500 companies are expected to report an 18.6 percent jump in first-quarter profit on average, according to Thomson Reuters data. \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 215.39 points, or 0.88 percent, to 24,788.43, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 28.35 points, or 1.06 percent, to 2,706.19, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 127.17 points, or 1.78 percent, to 7,283.46. \nMSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD PUS gained 0.73 percent. \nThe euro EUR= fell slightly after rising above $1.24 to a three-week high on mixed Chinese economic data, easing fears of Syria retaliation fears and overall renewed risk sentiment. \nSterling GBP= was last trading at $1.4289, down 0.32 percent, after hitting nearly $1.438, its highest level since Britain's vote in June 2016 to exit the European Union. \nThe dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback against six other major currencies, rose 0.11 percent, strengthened by the weaker euro and sterling and by stronger-than-expected U.S. housing starts in March and a positive reading on industrial production.[FRX/] \nShort-dated Treasury yields rose for a second day. The spread between 2- and 10-year Treasury bond yields US2US10=TWEB hit 43.2 basis points, the lowest level since August 2007. \n“Even with the bad weather in March, the data has really strengthened, supporting the view that the Fed will most likely have to hike rates in June,” said John Herrmann, director of U.S. rates strategies at MUFG Securities in New York. \nEuropean shares advanced [.EU], with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rising 0.8 percent. Germany's Deutsche Boerse DAX index .GDAXI closed 1.57 higher. \nOil prices steadied as investors took profit on last week’s rally and amid concern over the potential for supply disruptions.[O/R] \nBrent crude futures LCOc1 settled at $71.58 per barrel, up 0.22 percent. \nU.S. crude oil futures CLc1 settled up 0.45 percent at $66.52 per barrel. \nIn China, stocks in Shanghai [.SS] closed near a one-year low, after a U.S. move to ban American companies from selling components to Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp ( 0763.HK ) hurt tech stocks. \nIn addition, data showed that March industrial output in China missed expectations and first-quarter fixed-asset investment growth slowed. However, China’s economy grew 6.8 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier. \nU.S. sanctions on major Russian producer Rusal drove aluminium prices CMAL3 to almost $2,500 a tonne, their highest since mid 2011, before profit-taking reversed most gains. [MET/L]Rusal accounts for 6 to 7 percent of global aluminium supply.
