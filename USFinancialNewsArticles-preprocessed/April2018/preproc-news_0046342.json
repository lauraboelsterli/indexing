    "text": "16 COMMENTS Chanhassen, Minn.\nCelebration 2018, which was held here Thursday through Sunday at Paisley Park, offered an opportunity to commemorate the life and music of Prince via performances by former bandmates, panels and concert videos. While many fans attended to bask in the aura of the departed superstar, I was eager to try to locate the man behind the myth.\nOf all the rock, pop and jazz musicians I’ve covered for the Journal, I’ve never felt at a greater remove from an artist than I did from Prince. After the shock of his death at age 57 on April 21, 2016, it bothered me that I never felt much sense of him beyond his undeniably brilliant music and musicianship. To my mind, Prince remains the finest rock-and-pop musician of his time, an heir to James Brown, Jimi Hendrix, Joni Mitchell and Stevie Wonder, all wrapped up in one 5-foot-3-inch, 112-pound body. But as a fan, I found him cloaked behind a complex, repeatedly refined persona I couldn’t penetrate.\nOf course, most rock-and-pop artists present an image to the public that conceals who they are. Yet their music reveals some part of the self. When I hear musicians in Prince’s class—Björk, for example—I feel they are sharing with me a truth they discovered within themselves. Prince’s music felt like high art without such intimacy, even as I admired his sly wit and drive for excellence.\nPrince performing in 2011 Photo: Kevin Mazur/WireImage/The Prince Estate Paisley Park is Prince’s 65,000-square-foot estate, recording facility, rehearsal space and concert venue that now includes a museum—it may become to this part of Minnesota what Elvis Presley’s Graceland is to Memphis, Tenn. It is also where Prince died, as attendees here and fans around the world were reminded on Thursday, when it was announced that the investigation into his death, caused by an accidental overdose of the powerful opioid fentanyl, would be closed without criminal charges. As we paraded into the celebration, we passed not far from where his body was found. His cremated remains are kept in a model of Paisley Park, in a sun-strewn atrium where doves coo in a commodious cage.\nDespite the sobering news, the celebration went on as planned and the Purple Fam, as Prince loyalists are known, responded with the ardor of the devoted. I had the sense that no one but me felt anything but deeply connected to Prince.\nPrince4Ever Tribute Fence at Target Center in Minneapolis Photo: Steve Parke/Paisley Park Studios On Friday, we saw three concert films. We watched excerpts from a May 2015 show in Montreal that featured a fierce, Hendrix-worthy guitar performance by Prince as he fronted his final band, 3rdeyegirl. The second film was recorded before an intimate audience in the same Paisley Park room where we watched it, a set in which Prince previewed his “Piano & a Microphone Tour,” performing solo at the piano, accompanied only by synthetic strings. In this second film, Prince presented his introspective side. Some members of the Purple Fam who had been dancing gleefully during the funked-up 3rdeyegirl set wiped away tears as he issued a somber introduction to “Sometimes It Snows in April” with its lyric “Sometimes I wish life was never ending.” I sat quietly, noticing that, three months before he died, he seemed haggard, tired around his almond eyes, and there was the hint of a bald spot amid his fluffy hair. On Friday night at the Target Center in Minneapolis, Prince, performing on film, was accompanied by several of his former colleagues on the stage below. His on-screen effervescence and a powerhouse five-piece horn section elevated what could have been a macabre exercise.\nBK Jackson, Adrian Crutchfield, Marcus Anderson, and Joey Rayfield perform at at the Target Center Photo: Steve Parke/Paisley Park Studios As Celebration 2018 continued, accumulating facts brought me no closer to him. During panels, anodyne tales revealed little. But on Sunday, we were granted a tour of the museum that Prince had planned well before his death. For a few fleeting moments, I felt his presence. Not by his stage apparel on mannequins but by looking at his gear. Under the glitz and contrivances, he was a working musician dedicated to craft: He used effects pedals available at any guitar shop and remained loyal to his early ’80s Oberheim analog synthesizer and Linn drum machine, much as he remained loyal to Minneapolis and its suburbs. (Variety reports that an album of the star’s previously unreleased material will be released this fall.) Moving on, we were treated to a glimpse of his office that was kept as if he would return to resume business. His pool table is coated with purple felt. A cue stick awaited his return too.\nStudio A at Paisley Park Photo: NPG Records/Paisley Park But those orchestrated moments in which a facsimile of a personal connection to Prince was suggested had little lasting merit for me. While Celebration 2018 was plenty pleasurable, I walked away feeling that Prince the man was as distant as he had been before the festival and that his music was as close as I would get to him, as he preferred. And that will do. It will have to.\nA motorcycle featured in the film ‘Purple Rain’ Photo: NPG Records/Paisley Park —Mr. Fusilli is the Journal’s rock and pop music critic.
