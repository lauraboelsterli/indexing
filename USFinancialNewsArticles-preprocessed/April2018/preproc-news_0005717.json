    "text": "Ian Desmond hit an RBI double and a two-run homer Monday night, and Charlie Blackmon added two doubles, a solo homer and a runs-saving catch to lead the Colorado Rockies to a 7-4 road victory over the San Diego Padres.\nThe loss was the fourth straight for the Padres, their longest losing streak to start a season since the 1994 edition also opened with four straight losses.\nRight-hander Chad Bettis (1-0) held San Diego to two runs on five hits and four walks over five innings. He struck out four.\nPadres right fielder Wil Myers hit his first homer of the season in the first inning and came within feet of a grand slam in the second, but he left the game after the fifth, apparently due to the back issues that sidelined him Saturday night.\nSan Diego yielded a first-inning run for a third straight game. Blackmon led off with a double against Bryan Mitchell, moved to third on a DJ LeMahieu single and scored on Nolan Arenado’s sacrifice fly.\nAfter Myers tied the game in the bottom of the first, it looked as if the Padres were going to take the lead in the second. However, Blackmon made a leaping catch of Myers’ liner to deep center.\nColorado scored twice in the third on back-to-back RBI doubles by Carlos Gonzalez and Desmond after LeMahieu drew an inning-opening walk.\nThe Padres got one run back in the bottom of the third on doubles by Eric Hosmer and Carlos Asuaje, but they left the bases loaded for a second straight inning.\nDesmond’s 399-foot drive just to the right of the 396-foot sign in straightaway center just cleared the leap of Padres center fielder Manuel Margot.\nBlackmon and LeMahieu opened the ninth with back-to-back homers off reliever Kyle McGrath. Cory Spangenberg homered in the bottom of the ninth for the Padres, and Jose Pirela added an RBI triple.\nRockies closer Wade Davis entered to get the last out for his second save of the season.\nMitchell took the loss in his Padres debut, allowing five runs on eight hits and three walks in five innings. Right-handed reliever Jordan Lyles followed with three scoreless innings.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
