    "text": "COX’S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh are struggling from mental health issues, including suicidal thoughts, while almost half of the children are malnourished, according to aid agencies racing to boost services.\nFocus groups involving 300 people living in the densely populated “mega-camp” in Cox’s Bazar District found that 38 percent of children and 74 percent of adults “felt sad always”.\nSuicidal thoughts were reported by 4 percent of youth, according to an assessment by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), which has not previously been made public.\n“It’s an alert that youth are neglected from services,” said Olga Rebolledo, a mental health and psychosocial support coordinator with IOM. “They don’t have any options here right now, no possibilities for jobs or education.”\nAbout 700,000 Rohingya Muslims have crossed into Bangladesh from Myanmar since an Aug. 25 crackdown by the military in Rakhine state. Rohingya refugees reported killings, looting and rape in response to militant attacks on security forces.\nThe government of Buddhist-majority Myanmar says its forces have engaged in a legitimate campaign against Muslim “terrorists”, and has denied atrocities against civilians.\nBut aid agencies said many refugees are traumatized.\nOne elderly woman – whom the Thomson Reuters Foundation is not identifying due to the risk of retribution against her relatives in Myanmar – said she could not stop thinking about her son and husband who were killed by soldiers.\n“I dreamed about my son twice,” she said, sitting in a tarpaulin and bamboo shelter. “Once he was bringing me seeds to plant, and the second time he was hiding behind a wall.”\nSUFFERING FROM TRAUMA Her feelings are common, according to the IOM study, which found 63 percent of adult participants are constantly grieving for lost family members.\nRebolledo said a small percentage of people who experience such events may need psychiatric treatment but for others establishing stable living conditions, including security and access to food and education, can restore a sense of wellbeing.\nBut improving living standards is a challenge for aid agencies scrambling to provide services to the fastest growing refugee population in decades.\nThe population in the camp swelled to almost 600,000 from about 19,000 in four months, according to the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR.\nFood shortages were the most recurrent issue affecting the refugees’ mental health while inadequate shelter, poor sanitation and hygiene were also frequently cited as concerns.\nOne quarter of children in the camp are acutely malnourished, with 7.5 percent at a high risk of death from severe malnutrition, according to a study published on Tuesday.\nMore than 43 percent of children are chronically malnourished, said researchers from the United States’ Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the charity Action Against Hunger, and UNHCR.\nThe IOM study also found 40 percent of refugees cited “not being recognized as citizens” as psychologically destabilizing.\n“We can’t do anything about that,” said Rebolledo. “What we can do is show them that they have resources and a very strong sense of identity as a community.”\nStrengthening community bonds can promote mental health, said Rebolledo, and the IOM is partnering with organizations as the Red Cross and Action Against Hunger to scale up services.\nIn a program partially funded by the European Union, they will set up mobile teams to provide counseling and help organize community groups to engage in activities such as training, theater or working for better living conditions.\nReporting by Jared Ferrie; Editing by Belinda Goldsmith; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women’s rights, trafficking, property rights, resilience and climate change.
