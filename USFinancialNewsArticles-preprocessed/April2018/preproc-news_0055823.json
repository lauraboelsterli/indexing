    "text": "1 COMMENTS New York\nRarely has a show been less in need of good reviews, from me or anyone else, than “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” the latest line extension of J.K. Rowling’s franchise of novels, films and theme parks, which has come to New York after a stupendously successful 2016 opening in London. This two-part, five-hour extravaganza is the most expensive nonmusical production ever to open on Broadway, and every dollar of the $68.5 million ponied up by the producers is visible. The special effects are sensational, especially if you like theatrical “black magic,” and each one was dutifully applauded by the audiences at the previews I saw.\nHarry Potter and the Cursed Child, Parts One and Two\nLyric Theatre, 214 W. 43rd St.\n$20-$199, 212-556-4765\nBoth parts play consecutively on Wednesdays, Saturdays and Sundays\n‘Travesties’ Beyond that, I can do no more than to warn those who care that “The Cursed Child” plays like a musical—most of the show is underscored and all of the putative song cues are self-evident—and might have been slightly more fun had it been one. The script, written by Jack Thorne from “an original new story” by Ms. Rowling, Mr. Thorne and John Tiffany, tells what happens to Harry ( Jamie Parker ) and Albus ( Sam Clemmett ), his rebellious young son, in later life. (Spoiler alert: They save the world.) To those who have never read a Potter novel or seen a Potter film, “The Cursed Child” will make no sense at all. Everyone else should find the plot trite—Mr. Thorne and his collaborators have used up Broadway’s time-travel quota for the rest of the century—though there’s always something cool to see onstage, which helps a bit.\nDuly noted: The British stars of “The Cursed Child” make no effort to speak their lines in a way that American audiences will find comprehensible. As a result, large chunks of the script are hard to follow. They could stand to take a cue from Byron Jennings, the distinguished American stage actor who plays two key supporting roles (both of which must not be named) and is at all times completely and refreshingly intelligible.\n—Mr. Teachout, the Journal’s drama critic, is the author, most recently, of “Billy and Me.” ",
