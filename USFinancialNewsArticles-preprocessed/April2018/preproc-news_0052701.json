Tanz, President and Chief Executive Officer of Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. stated, “As 2018 gets fully underway, we are off to another solid start. Demand for space from a broad and growing number of retailers continues to accelerate across our portfolio, as evidenced by our record, first quarter leasing activity. Additionally, we again achieved a portfolio lease rate above 97%, as well as strong, same-space rent increases, averaging 21.6% on new leases executed during the first quarter.” Along with the strong demand from new retailers seeking space at our shopping centers, an increasing number of our existing, necessity-based tenants are proactively seeking to renew their leases well ahead of schedule, which is indicative of the long-term appeal of our properties and fundamental strength of our core West Coast markets.” Tanz concluded, “Given our performance to date, we are on track thus far to meet our previously stated guidance of achieving FFO between $1.16 and $1.20 per diluted share for 2018.”\nFINANCIAL SUMMARY\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2018, GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders was $10.7 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, as compared to GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders of $10.2 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. FFO for the first quarter of 2018 was $37.0 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, as compared to $34.3 million in FFO, or $0.28 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2017. Included in GAAP net income and FFO for the first quarter of 2018 was $2.2 million of lease settlement income received in connection with a property currently lined up to be sold that is slated for new, multi-family development. ROIC reports FFO as a supplemental performance measure in accordance with the definition set forth by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. A reconciliation of GAAP net income to FFO is provided at the end of this press release.\nAt March 31, 2018, ROIC had a total market capitalization of approximately $3.7 billion with approximately $1.5 billion of principal debt outstanding, equating to a 40.8% debt-to-total market capitalization ratio. ROIC’s principal debt outstanding was comprised of $96.0 million of mortgage debt and approximately $1.4 billion of unsecured debt, including $159.5 million outstanding on its unsecured revolving credit facility at March 31, 2018. During the first quarter, ROIC retired a $10.1 million mortgage.
