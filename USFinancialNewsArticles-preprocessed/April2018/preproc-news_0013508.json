    "text": "EditorsNote: Edit 1: syntax fixes;\nPinch-hitter Kyle Farmer drove in the tie-breaking run with a double off the right-field fence with two outs in the 10th inning Sunday afternoon, lifting the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 2-1 victory over the San Francisco Giants and a split of their two-game series in San Francisco.\nIn what began as a pitchers’ duel between left-handers Clayton Kershaw of the Dodgers and Ty Black of the Giants, the Dodgers wasted no time in the 10th against the fifth Giants pitcher, right-hander Pierce Johnson (0-1).\nCody Bellinger, who is recovering from a case of food poisoning and entered the game in the eighth, led off the inning with a double. After Corey Seager was walked intentionally with one out, Johnson got Yasiel Puig to fly out before Farmer, the last available position player on the Dodgers’ bench, went the opposite way for the eventual game-winner.\nRight-hander Josh Fields (1-0), who pitched a 1-2-3 ninth to force extra innings, got the win. Closer Kenley Jansen, making his fourth appearance of the season, was credited with his first save but allowed a one-out single and stolen base to Hunter Pence in the 10th.\nThe win allowed the Dodgers to split the series after the Giants had rallied for a 7-5, 14-inning, win Saturday on a three-run, walk-off home run by Andrew McCutchen.\nThe teams have split six games this season, with a seventh meeting having been rained out Friday and rescheduled for a doubleheader when the teams meet for another four games later this month in San Francisco.\nKershaw, who has a 13-4 record at AT&T Park, appeared headed for another win before the Giants erased a 1-0 deficit with a run in the eighth.\nPence singled to lead off the inning and Kelby Tomlinson beat out a bunt, ending Kershaw’s day.\nPinch-hitter Buster Posey greeted reliever JT Chargois with an RBI single, but the right-hander was able to keep the game tied at 1 by getting the next two hitters, including inducing Austin Jackson into grounding into a double play.\nKershaw, who lost to the Giants on Opening Day, allowed one run and six hits in seven innings. He struck out six and did not walk a batter.\nThe Dodgers gave their ace a 1-0 lead in the fourth against Blach after Puig singled and Enrique Hernandez drew a walk.\nWith one out, Matt Kemp singled to right field, scoring Puig with the game’s first run and sending Hernandez to third.\nBut with runners at the corners and one out, Blach got Logan Forsythe to ground into a double play, minimizing the damage.\nNeither starting pitcher got a decision.\nBlach, going head-to-head with Kershaw for the second time already this season, left trailing 1-0 after allowing four hits and the one run in six innings. He walked three and struck out one.\nPuig and Kemp had two hits apiece for the Dodgers, who out-hit the Giants 10-8 to snap a four-game losing streak.\nPence and Evan Longoria collected two hits each for the Giants, who had won two straight.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
