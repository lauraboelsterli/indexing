    "text": "Michigan’s highest court on Wednesday ​heard ​arguments on whether the right to openly carry firearms extends to school grounds.\nUntil recently, no law or regulation in Ann Arbor, home to the University of Michigan, prevented a properly licensed gun owner from walking into a school with a holstered pistol.

RELATED VIDEO 20 Years of School Shootings Since 1998, there have been more than a dozen shootings at kindergarten, elementary, middle and high schools that resulted in multiple deaths. These are some of the victims. ",
