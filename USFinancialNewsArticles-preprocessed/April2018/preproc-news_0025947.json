    "text": "April 13, 2018 / 6:58 PM / Updated 16 minutes ago Leading Kenyan conservationist Daphne Sheldrick dies of cancer Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nNAIROBI (Reuters) - Dame Daphne Sheldrick, a well-known Kenyan conservationist who helped protect the East African country’s wildlife for 60 years, has died, her organization announced on Friday, describing her \nas a friend of elephants who “learned to read their hearts.” \nBorn in 1934 in Kenya, Sheldrick died Thursday evening “after a long battle with breast cancer,” according to her organization the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT) which she helped found in 1977 after the death of her husband. \nThe statement praised her for helping deepen the world’s understanding of elephants and rhinos. \nShe pioneered raising orphaned infant elephants and rhinos on milk, the statement said, and that the knowledge has since saved 230 elephants in Kenya. \n“Daphne lived alongside elephants and learned to read their hearts...she understood their fragility, their intelligence, their capacity to love,” the statement said.
