    "text": "China and India agree to maintain border peace as Modi wraps up visit India, China agree to maintain border peace, Indian foreign secretary says Indian prime minister in China for informal meeting with President Xi Jinping Chinese state media praises the tone of the get-together Published 4 Hours Ago Reuters\nIndia and China have agreed to improve communication between their militaries to maintain peace at the border, India's foreign secretary said on Saturday at the end of an ice-breaking trip to China by Prime Minister Narendra Modi .\nModi has spent the past 24 hours in the central Chinese city of Wuhan for informal meetings with President Xi Jinping , months after a dispute over a stretch of their high-altitude Himalayan border rekindled fears of war between the Asian nations.\nIndian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale told reporters after Modi and Xi wrapped up their talks that both leaders had agreed their two countries had the maturity and wisdom to handle all their differences peacefully through talks.\n\"On the issue of the India-China boundary question, the two leaders endorsed the work of the special representatives in their efforts to find a fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable settlement,\" he said.\n\"And the two leaders also underscored that in the meantime it is important to maintain peace and tranquillity in all areas of the India-China border region,\" Gokhale said.\nBilled by both sides as an informal meeting rather than a summit, with none of the pomp and ceremony of a state visit such as 21-gun salutes, the two men held talks on Friday that lasted far longer than expected. It also included a personal tour of a major museum by Xi.\nChinese state media has praised the tone of the trip.\nThe overseas edition of the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily said in a front page commentary on Saturday \"two great countries ought to have great cooperation,\" and showed a large picture of the two leaders shaking hands.\n\"There is reason to believe that this Wuhan meeting will increase mutual trust, manage and control disputes, deepen cooperation and lead to a new phase in China-India relations,\" it said.\n\"It is quite clear that strategic agreement between the two countries far exceeds the specific differences, and the need for cooperation far exceeds local friction,\" it said.\nThe official China Daily said in an editorial there was no denying mutual suspicion was keeping the two countries from working together.\n\"Yet neither Beijing nor New Delhi calls the other an enemy, which means both expect bilateral ties to improve. Indeed, China and India are natural partners,\" it said.\nDespite the upbeat statements, which on Friday included Modi inviting Xi to India for a similar informal summit next year, the nations' differences are significant.\nAs well as disputes over stretches of a 3,500 km (2,200 miles) border, they are bumping up against each other in the Indian Ocean and squabbling over Xi's signature Belt and Road infrastructure initiative.\nIndia signaled as recently as Tuesday its opposition to the grand trade and transport plan because one of its branches runs through Pakistani-administered Kashmir, which India claims.\nIndia has long been suspicious of China's traditionally close ties with Pakistan.\nFor its part, China has been concerned about U.S. efforts to draw India into a maritime \"quad\" of democracies, including Japan and Australia.\nChina is also suspicious of India's hosting of the Dalai Lama and other exiled Tibetans.",
