    "text": "April 9, 2018 / 6:55 PM / Updated 18 minutes ago Two tourists killed, six injured in Malta bus crash Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nVALLETTA (Reuters) - A 62-year-old Belgian man and a 37-year-old Spanish woman were killed and six other tourists critically injured in Malta on Monday when a double-decker tourist bus hit low-hanging tree branches, police said. Rescue workers retrieve a tourist's body from the top of an open top, double-decker sightseeing bus after it crashed into some low-lying tree branches, in Zurrieq, Malta April 9, 2018. REUTERS/Darrin Zammit Lupi \nHealth Minister Chris Fearne said three of the badly injured were Britons - two boys aged six and eight, and a man aged 44. The others were a German woman, 31, an Italian woman, 72, and a 35-year-old man whose nationality is not yet known. \nThe accident happened at Zurrieq, 16 km (10 miles) from Valletta, on a road frequently used by tourist buses. Local media reported the branches may have been lower than usual because of damage from gale-force winds on Sunday night. Slideshow (3 Images) \nThe tourists were sitting on the open top deck of the bus. \nRescuers used cranes to lift the injured on stretchers from the top deck.
