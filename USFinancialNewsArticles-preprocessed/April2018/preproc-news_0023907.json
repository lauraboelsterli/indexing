    "text": "Redstone likely to replace Moonves as head of CBS if no deal with Viacom, sources say\nRedstone likely to replace Moonves if no deal: Sources Redstone to replace CBS board if deal isn't reached: Sources CBS expected to make another offer soon: Sources New bid expected to be insufficient on price: Sources David Faber | John Melloy\nShari Redstone, whose National Amusements controls both CBS and Viacom, is likely to replace CBS CEO Les Moonves if a deal isn't reached between the two companies as the media tie-up hits an impasse, sources familiar with the situation said.\nCBS is expected to make another offer soon, the sources said, but that new bid was expected to be insufficient on price. The amount of synergy expected by CBS is well below that of Viacom.\nBut the main obstacle to the rejoining of the network and owner of Nickelodeon and MTV is a personnel fight between Redstone and Moonves. As CNBC previously reported , Moonves wants to pick his own management team if he is to head the combined entity and favors Joe Ianniello, chief operating officer of CBS, as his key lieutenant. Redstone, however, wants Bob Bakish, the current CEO of Viacom, as No. 2.\nRedstone is also expected to replace the CBS board if a deal isn't reached, the sources said.\nPreviously, Moonves was believed to had agreed with Redstone to run the combined company for at least two years.\nCBS shares were down 1.5 percent on Wednesday and Viacom shares were off by 1 percent. National Amusements, founded by Redstone's father, Sumner, owns an 80 percent of each company.\nFor more information contact:\nJennifer Dauble\nCNBC\nt: 201.735.4721\nm: 201.615.2787\ne: jennifer.dauble@nbcuni.com\nEmma Martin\nCNBC\nt: 201.735.4713\nm: 551.275.6221\ne: emma.martin@nbcuni.com\nAbout CNBC:\nWith CNBC in the U.S., CNBC in Asia Pacific, CNBC in Europe, Middle East and Africa, and CNBC World, CNBC is the recognized world leader in business news and provides real-time financial market coverage and business information to more than 409 million homes worldwide, including more than 91 million households in the United States and Canada.
