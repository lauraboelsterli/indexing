Shares in Seoul briefly rose more than 1 percent to a one-month high and Japan’s Nikkei share average also gained.\nGRAPHIC: here ‘BALL IN U.S. COURT’\nAs part of efforts to reduce tension, the two sides agreed to open a liaison office, stop propaganda broadcasts and leaflet drops along the border and allow Korean families divided by the border to meet.\nDays before the summit, Kim said North Korea would suspend nuclear and long-range missile tests and dismantle its only known nuclear test site.\nBut there has been widespread scepticism about whether Kim is ready to abandon the nuclear arsenal his country has developed for decades, justifying it as a necessary deterrent against U.S. invasion.\n“Everything will not be resolved in the blink of an eye,” said Kim Young-hee, a North Korean defector-turned-economist at the Korea Development Bank.\n“Kim Jong Un has put the ball in the U.S. court. He declared denuclearisation, and promised to halt nuclear tests,” she said. “That tells us he wants the United States to guarantee the safety of his regime ... in return for denuclearisation.”\nIt is not the first time leaders of North and South Korea have declared hopes for peace. Two earlier summits, in Pyongyang in 2000 and 2007, failed to halt the North’s weapons programmes or improve relations in a lasting way.

FIRST ACROSS THE LINE\nEarlier, Moon greeted Kim at the military demarcation line where the men smiled and shook hands.\nIn an unplanned move, Kim invited Moon to step briefly across into North Korea, before the two leaders crossed back into South Korea holding hands.\n“I was excited to meet at this historic place and it is really moving that you came all the way to the demarcation line to greet me in person,” Kim said, wearing his customary black Mao suit.\n“A new history starts now. An age of peace, from the starting point of history,” Kim wrote in Korean in a guest book in the South’s Peace House before talks began.\nDuring a private meeting in the morning, Kim told Moon he came to the summit to end the history of conflict and joked he was sorry for waking Moon up with his early morning missile tests, a senior presidential official said.\nMoon and Kim released their joint declaration before a dinner banquet.\nLater, with their wives, they watched a music performance and held hands as they watched a montage of photos from their summit set to a K-pop song that included the words “be a family again”.\nAfter warm farewells, Kim was driven back to North Korea.\nThe United States said earlier it was hopeful talks on peace and prosperity would make progress and it looked forward to discussions with South Korea in preparation for the planned meeting of Trump and Kim in coming weeks.\nJust months ago, Trump and Kim were trading threats and insults as the North made rapid advances in pursuit of nuclear-armed missiles capable of hitting the United States.\nThe United States stations 28,500 troops in South Korea as a legacy of the Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. The war pitted the South, U.N. and U.S. forces against the communist North, backed by China and Russia. Slideshow (32 Images)\nKim and Trump are expected to meet in late May or June. Trump said on Thursday he was considering several dates and venues.
