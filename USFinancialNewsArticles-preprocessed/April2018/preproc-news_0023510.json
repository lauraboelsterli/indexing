    "text": "PALO ALTO, Calif., April 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) announced today the election of four members to the Board of Directors and the appointment of two external directors.\nEffective today, Paula Gold-Williams, President and CEO of CPS Energy and John McAvoy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Consolidated Edison Inc. (Con Edison) and its principal subsidiary, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc., were elected to four-year terms as were interim Board members Stanley W. Connally, Jr., Chairman, President and CEO of Gulf Power Company and Douglas F. Esamann, Vice President of Energy Solutions for Duke Energy.\nGold-Williams has led San Antonio-based CPS since July 2016 after serving nine months in an interim role. Since 2008, she has served CPS Energy as Group Executive Vice President - Financial and Administrative Services and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Treasurer for the nation's largest gas and electric municipal utility. She also has served as Chief Administrative Officer and Controller.\nMcAvoy joined Con Edison in 1980 and has served as President and CEO of Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (O&R), a Consolidated Edison, Inc., subsidiary that operates utility companies in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Prior to his leadership of O&R, McAvoy served as Senior Vice President of Central Operations with oversight of the electric transmission system, more than 100 substations in and around New York City, the company's primary control center, engineering and construction activities and electric and steam generating plants.\nConnally has been the Chief Executive Officer and President of Gulf Power Company, a subsidiary of Southern Company, since July 1, 2012 and has been its Chairman since July 2015. He served as Senior Vice President and Senior Production Officer of Generation for Georgia Power from July 2010 to July 1, 2012. He served also as Senior Vice President of Fossil and Hydro Generation at the utility, and before that position, Connally was the Chief Production Officer. He served as Plant Manager at Alabama Power's Plant Barry in 2007.\nEsamann is Executive Vice President of Energy Solutions for Duke Energy, where he oversees corporate and regulatory strategy, emerging technology and the company’s regulated and commercial renewable energy operations. As President of the Midwest and Florida regions, he has responsibility for the strategic direction and performance of the company’s regulated electric utilities in Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky and Florida. He has also served as a President of Duke Energy Indiana; Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy at Duke Energy; Group Vice President at Duke Energy and Senior Vice President of Energy Portfolio Strategy and Management for Cinergy, prior to its merger with Duke Energy.\nThe Board also announced the appointment of two external directors to four-year terms. They are: Colette Honorable, Partner, Reed Smith law firm and a former Commissioner of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and Dennis McGinn, former Assistant Secretary of the Navy and retired Vice Admiral. Both have served on the Advisory Council, an independent stakeholder group that advises EPRI and the Board on trends in political, economic and social issues that affect electric utilities, and assists with prioritizing research and ensuring its relevance and balance in serving the public interest.\nHonorable is a member of Reed Smith’s Energy and Natural Resources Group in the Washington, D.C., office. She is a highly-regarded policymaker in domestic and international energy sectors. Honorable joined the firm after being appointed by President Barack Obama to serve as Commissioner at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, where she focused on reliability oversight of the bulk power system. Prior to her tenure at FERC, she chaired the Arkansas Public Service Commission (PSC). Honorable is also a Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center and a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution.\nAdmiral McGinn is a member of the Center for Climate and Security Advisory Board. He served as Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Energy, Installations and Environment from September 2013 until January 2017, leading the transformation of naval installations toward greater mission resiliency. During his 35-year naval career, Admiral McGinn served as a naval aviator, test pilot, aircraft carrier commanding officer and national security strategist.\n“The expansive experience that that these individuals have will provide our Board of Directors keen insights on addressing the challenges faced by the industry,” said Michael W. Howard, EPRI President and CEO. “Our Board derives great value from these broad perspectives which help us to perform our mission to serve the public benefit.”\nAbout EPRI:\nThe Electric Power Research Institute, Inc.
