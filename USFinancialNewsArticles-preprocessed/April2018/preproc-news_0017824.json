    "text": "Starling Marte highlighted a six-run sixth inning with a bases-clearing triple Friday night, helping the Pittsburgh Pirates continue their fast start with a 14-3 romp over the Cincinnati Reds in Pittsburgh.\nRookie Colin Moran had four hits, including a double, scored three runs and drove in three for the Pirates (6-1), who have won the first two games in the three-game series.\nJesse Winker had three hits and an RBI for the Reds (1-5), who were outhit 15-13.\nThe Pirates led just 4-2 in the sixth before Moran greeted reliever Yovani Gallardo with his third hit, a single. After Jordy Mercer doubled, Josh Harrison singled in Moran for a 5-2 lead.\nGregory Polanco followed with a walk that loaded the bases, after which Marte lined a triple to the gap in right-center, scoring all three baserunners for an 8-2 advantage.\nCorey Dickerson made it a six-run inning and an eight-run lead with a two-run double two batters later.\nGallardo was pitching in relief of Reds starter Luis Castillo (0-2), who allowed four runs and six hits in five innings. He walked three and struck out three.\nThe Pirates piled on with four runs in the seventh for a 14-2 lead. Polanco had the big hit, a two-run double.\nTrevor Williams (2-0), who pitched six innings of no-hit ball in his season debut against Detroit, got the win despite allowing 10 hits in 5 1/3 innings. He limited the Reds to two runs, walking one and striking out four.\nMercer and Dickerson had two doubles and a single apiece for the Pirates, who totaled seven extra-base hits. Marte and Harrison added two hits each.\nPirates relievers Edgar Santana, Josh Smoker and Clay Holmes combined for 3 2/3 innings of one-run relief, allowing three hits and two walks.\nCastillo, batting eighth in the Reds’ lineup, had two hits and scored a run. He had the club’s only extra-base hit, a double.\nJoey Votto and Jose Peraza also had two hits for the Reds.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
