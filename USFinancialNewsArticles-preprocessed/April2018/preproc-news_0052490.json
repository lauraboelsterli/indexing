    "text": "Merger and Simplification on Track to Close in Second Quarter 2018\nFinalized Strategic Growth Projects to Supply Refined Products to Mexico\nRecently Closed on Immediately Accretive Pipeline and Terminal Acquisition\nSAN ANTONIO--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- For the first quarter of 2018, NuStar Energy L.P.’s (NYSE: NS) (the “Partnership” or “NuStar” or “NS”) net income applicable to common limited partners was $107 million, or $1.15 per unit, up 178% from $38 million, or $0.49 per unit for first quarter 2017, while earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were $250 million, up 62% from $154 million for first quarter 2017.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180426005566/en/\nDuring the first quarter of 2018, the partnership received hurricane insurance proceeds of $87.5 million to fully cover the cost of repairing the property damage at its St. Eustatius terminal during 2017. While a gain of $79 million was reflected in the partnership’s first quarter net income and EBITDA, NuStar stated that it is important to note that the gain will only be recognized in distributable cash flow (DCF) available to common limited partners as the proceeds are spent over the next couple of years to repair damage caused from the hurricane.\nThe partnership announced first quarter 2018 Series A, Series B and Series C preferred unit distributions of $0.53125 per unit, $0.47657 per unit and $0.56250 per unit, respectively, that will be paid on June 15, 2018 to holders of record as of June 1, 2018. In addition, a first quarter 2018 common unit distribution of $0.60 per unit will be paid on May 14, 2018 to holders of record as of May 8, 2018.\n“Excluding the effect of the associated gain related to hurricane insurance proceeds, our strong first quarter results were primarily driven by contributions from our Permian Crude System and increased storage rates at some of our international storage facilities. In addition, we experienced improved results in our Fuels Marketing segment due to the streamlining efforts that we executed last year. Overall, the strength of our business was demonstrated this quarter as results in all three of our segments were up, quarter over quarter,” said Brad Barron, President and Chief Executive Officer of NuStar Energy L.P. and NuStar GP Holdings, LLC.\nBarron continued, “During our most recent earnings call in early February, we laid out a comprehensive, staged approach to best position NuStar for long-term financial strength and sustainable growth, which includes simplifying our structure, restoring our coverage, lowering our leverage and minimizing our need to access the equity capital markets. Since then, we have made substantial progress on our simplification. In mid-March, we filed a Form S-4 preliminary proxy statement to seek NuStar GP Holdings, LLC’s unitholder approval and issue NS units to execute the simplification. We are in the process of responding to the SEC’s comments to the Form S-4, and we expect to be positioned to schedule the unitholder vote and close by the end of the second quarter.”\nStrategic Growth Projects to Supply Refined Products to Mexico\nBarron also announced that NuStar will be expanding its existing pipeline assets in South Texas, as well as its terminal in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, with projects to supply refined products to growing markets in Mexico.\n“For those of you who have followed NuStar over the years, you know that, since Mexico’s energy reforms began, we have been excited about the new opportunities those reforms presented for us,” Barron said. “Since then, we have worked to position NuStar to take advantage of these opportunities by utilizing our existing assets in South Texas and Mexico to supply products to the Mexico market, and I’m happy to say we have accomplished that.\n“In support of this expansion, I am pleased to announce that we have signed several long-term T&D contracts with strong, creditworthy customers to support a series of healthy-return capital projects to connect to third-party rail facilities in Corpus Christi, expand certain South Texas products pipeline systems and expand our terminal in Nuevo Laredo.\n“We expect to benefit from incremental revenue from these projects, starting as soon as late 2018, and we believe the Mexico market presents significant opportunities for future growth. And, I am proud of our team’s perseverance and creativity in developing these projects, which we believe will establish NuStar as one of the primary logistics providers for this burgeoning market,” said Barron.\nCompleted Purchase of Refined Products Pipeline and Terminal from CHS Inc.\nBarron also stated that in mid-April, NuStar closed on an immediately accretive, $38 million acquisition of CHS’ Council Bluffs system, consisting of a 227-mile pipeline and 18 storage tanks at a very attractive multiple.\n“This bolt-on system is supported by long-term throughput and storage agreements and enhances our existing Central East System by increasing our overall system flexibility and allowing expansion into new markets, while at the same time enhancing our role as a key logistics provider to CHS,” said Barron.\nNuStar GP Holdings, LLC’s Earnings Results for First Quarter 2018\nNuStar GP Holdings, LLC (NYSE: NSH) (the “Company” or “NSH”) today announced first quarter 2018 net income of $12 million, or $0.28 per unit, and DCF available to unitholders of $6 million.\nThe company also announced a first quarter 2018 distribution of $0.33 per unit that will be paid on May 16, 2018 to holders of record as of May 8, 2018. The NSH distribution was calculated assuming that NSH unitholders are expected to receive 0.55 units of NS for each NSH unit they own after the closing of the upcoming simplification transaction.\nConference Call Details\nA conference call with management is scheduled for 10:00 a.m. CT today, April 26, 2018, to discuss the financial and operational results for the first quarter of 2018.

Management believes these financial measures provide useful information to investors and other external users of our financial information because (i) they provide additional information about the operating performance of the partnership’s assets and the cash the business is generating, (ii) investors and other external users of our financial statements benefit from having access to the same financial measures being utilized by management and our board of directors when making financial, operational, compensation and planning decisions and (iii) they highlight the impact of significant transactions.\nOur board of directors and management use EBITDA and/or DCF when assessing the following: (i) the performance of our assets, (ii) the viability of potential projects, (iii) our ability to fund distributions, (iv) our ability to fund capital expenditures and (v) our ability to service debt. In addition, our board of directors uses a distribution coverage ratio, which is calculated based on DCF, as one of the factors in its determination of the company-wide bonus and the vesting of performance units awarded to management. DCF is a widely accepted financial indicator used by the master limited partnership (MLP) investment community to compare partnership performance. DCF is used by the MLP investment community, in part, because the value of a partnership unit is partially based on its yield, and its yield is based on the cash distributions a partnership can pay its unitholders.\nNone of these financial measures are presented as an alternative to net income. They should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following is a reconciliation of EBITDA, DCF and distribution coverage ratio:\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 2017 Net income $ 126,133 $ 57,940 Interest expense, net 47,772 36,414 Income tax expense 4,327 2,925 Depreciation and amortization expense 72,015 56,864 EBITDA 250,247 154,143 Interest expense, net (47,772 ) (36,414 ) Reliability capital expenditures (19,882 ) (5,022 ) Income tax expense (4,327 ) (2,925 ) Mark-to-market impact of hedge transactions (a) 206 (2,586 ) Unit-based compensation (b) 1,337 2,088 Preferred unit distributions (15,990 ) (4,813 ) Insurance gain adjustment (c) (66,362 ) — Other items (d) (4,584 ) (274 ) DCF $ 92,873 $ 104,197 Less DCF available to general partner 1,141 15,255 DCF available to common limited partners $ 91,732 $ 88,942 Distributions applicable to common limited partners $ 55,916 $ 101,913 Distribution coverage ratio (e) 1.64x 0.87x (a) DCF excludes the impact of unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses that arise from valuing certain derivative contracts, as well as the associated hedged inventory. The gain or loss associated with these contracts is realized in DCF when the contracts are settled. (b) We intend to satisfy the vestings of equity-based awards with the issuance of our common units. As such, the expenses related to these awards are considered non-cash and added back to DCF. Certain awards include distribution equivalent rights (DERs). Payments made in connection with DERs are deducted from DCF. (c) DCF excludes a portion of the insurance gain, which will be added to DCF in future periods to offset reliability capital expenditures as they are incurred for hurricane repairs at our St. Eustatius terminal. (d) Other items primarily consist of a commercial settlement and noncash compensation. (e) Distribution coverage ratio is calculated by dividing DCF available to common limited partners by distributions applicable to common limited partners.
