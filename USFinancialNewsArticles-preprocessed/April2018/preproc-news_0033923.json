The hires underscore Ciox’s transformational growth, as the company expands into new markets and bolsters its technology offerings.\nIn his new role, Ramakrishnan will focus on operational improvements and transformation in data acquisition and coding. Before joining Ciox, he was an executive vice president at IRI, where he oversaw global teams and managed multi-million dollar strategic partnerships. Prior to his work with IRI, Ramakrishnan held senior leadership roles at R1 RCM (formerly Accretive Health) and Aon Hewitt.\n“Arvind’s wealth of experience in healthcare and other markets will prove hugely valuable to our customers,” says Mike Connolly, president of Clinical Data Acquisition and Insights at Ciox. “He’s a true change agent, and his leadership will be crucial as Ciox continues its growth.”\nKim came to Ciox after spending nine years at GT Advanced Technologies as chief administrative officer, vice president and general counsel.
