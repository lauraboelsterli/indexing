    "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union’s ambassador to Russia, Markus Ederer, has returned to Moscow, an aide said on Friday, some three weeks after being recalled in symbolic retaliation by the bloc for the Salisbury spy poisoning.\nBritain in March blamed Moscow for a toxin attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter in England that has left them critically ill for weeks.\nThe EU’s other 27 members took the same stance as Britain and most went on to expel Russian diplomats suspected to be working as spies on their territory.\nThe poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in March has plunged relations between Moscow and London to new lows.
