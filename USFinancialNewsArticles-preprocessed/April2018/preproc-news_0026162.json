    "text": "April 14, 2018 / 3:38 PM / in an hour Hungarians stage anti-government rally in Budapest Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBUDAPEST (Reuters) - Several thousand Hungarians protested in Budapest on Saturday against what organisers said was an unfair election system that gave Prime Minister Viktor Orban another landslide victory at the polls after a “hate campaign” against immigrants. A woman holds a placard as she attends a protest against the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Budapest, Hungary, April 14, 2018. The placard reads, \"Not my Prime Minister\". REUTERS/Bernadett Szabo \nOrban won a third straight term in power in Sunday elections after his anti-immigration campaign message secured a strong majority for his ruling Fidesz party in parliament, granting him two-thirds of seats based on preliminary results. \nIn a Facebook post before the rally, organisers have called for a recount of ballots, a free media, a new election law, as well as more efficient co-operation among opposition parties instead of the bickering seen in the run-up to the vote. \nThe demonstrators, many of whom carried Hungary’s tricolour national flag, were to march from Budapest’s Opera House to Parliament near the Danube River.
