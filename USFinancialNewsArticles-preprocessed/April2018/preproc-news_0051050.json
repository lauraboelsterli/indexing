Paratek’s New Drug Applications have been accepted for priority review by the U.S. FDA and the Company is preparing a marketing authorization in the European Union. Paratek has entered into a collaboration agreement with Zai Lab for the development and commercialization of omadacycline in the greater China region, and retains all remaining global rights.\nUnder a research agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense, omadacycline also is being studied against pathogenic agents causing infectious diseases of public health and biodefense importance, including plague and anthrax.\nParatek's second Phase 3 product candidate, SEYSARA™ (sarecycline), is being developed by Allergan in the U.S. as a new once-daily oral therapy for the treatment of acne. Allergan has completed Phase 3 development activities for SEYSARA and its new drug application was accepted for review by the U.S. FDA in December 2017. Paratek retains all ex-U.S. rights to sarecycline.\nRecognizing the serious threat of bacterial infections, Paratek is dedicated to providing solutions that enable positive outcomes and lead to better patient stories.\nFor more information, visit www.ParatekPharma.com or follow @ParatekPharma on Twitter.\nForward Looking Statements\nThis press release contains including statements related to our overall strategy, product candidates, clinical studies, prospects, potential and expected results, including statements about the timing of advancing omadacycline and otherwise preparing for clinical studies, the timing of enrollment in our clinical studies and our reporting of the results of such studies, the potential for omadacycline to serve as an empiric monotherapy treatment option for patients suffering from ABSSSI, CABP, UTI, and other bacterial infections when resistance is of concern, the prospect of omadacycline providing broad-spectrum activity, and our ability to obtain regulatory approval of omadacycline All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press release are , and are identified by words such as \"advancing,\" \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"well positioned,\" \"look forward,\" \"anticipated,\" \"continued,\" and other words and terms of similar meaning.
