The previous year was a transformative period for SSLJ as we expanded our operations throughout China and added new revenue segments. In 2016, 91% of our home improving and furnishing products revenue came from our Wuhan, Shenzen, and Shanghai offices, as compared to 63% in 2017 as we strengthened our sales teams in all branches throughout mainland China. Further, we started generating revenues from two additional segments, advertising income from merchants and sales of smart home products and materials as we continue to develop our platform. Accounting for the revenue from our home improvement and furnishing projects, as well as the two new revenue segments, SSLJ saw an impressive 201% increase in revenue and a 133% increase in gross profit from the previous year.\"\nMr. Zheng added, \"We have achieved substantial accomplishments in 2017 to expand the influence of our brand, develop our strategy, and integrate smart technology into our service offerings. Overall, we achieved strong operating momentum in the 2017 fiscal year which we hope will continue. We believe that with the launch of our new smart home services and associated online store, and our increased marketing efforts in 2017 including an endorsement agreement with celebrity and online marketing campaigns on third party websites and search engines, we have laid down a solid foundation for growth in 2018. The following events also complement the aforementioned efforts, where we completed our IPO in two closings, on January 31, 2018 and February 2, 2018, and entered into new cooperation agreements with key partners including JD.com, the largest e-commerce company and retailer in China, Hubei Rural Credit Cooperatives, the largest credit union in Hubei Province, and Tianmen Han Da Tech Co., Ltd., a leading construction and e-commerce platform company in China, as disclosed in previous press releases. Looking ahead, we will continue our mission to develop an optimal experience for our potential customers looking to decorate or redecorate their living spaces.\"\nFiscal Year 2017 Financial Highlights\nFor the Years Ended December 31\n($ millions, except per share data)\n2017\n2016\n% Change\nRevenue\n16.32\n5.42\n201.1%\nHome improving and furnishing projects\n10.49\n5.42\n93.5%\nSales of smart home products and materials\n3.91\n-\nNM\nAdvertising\n1.92\n-\nNM\nGross profit\n1.41\n0.61\n133.2%\nGross margin\n8.7%\n11.2%\n-2.5%\nIncome (loss) from operations\n-23.54\n-12.82\nNM\nOperating margin\n-144%\n-236%\nNM\nNet income (loss) attributable to SSLJ.com\n-23.72\n-13.18\nNM\nEarnings (loss) per share\n-0.59\n-0.32\nNM\nRevenues increased by 201.1% to $16.32 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 from $5.42 million for the same period of last year, mainly due to increase in contract revenues of home improving and furnishing projects in terms of number of contracts completed and average revenue per contract; and new sales of smart home products and materials as well as advertising services.

The net loss reflects the significant operational costs incurred due to rapid expansion including additional rent paid by new branches and expenses associated with setting up additional sales teams. During the year ended December 31, 2017, a net loss incurred mainly due to significant efforts devoted to advertising activities in the second quarter of 2017 to promote our home furnishing service together with increased effort in building up the research and development department so as to develop more smart home products to widen our products range which are sold through online stores and distributors.

Cost of smart home products and materials as well as advertising services were $3.40 million and $1.90 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017.\nGross profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit increased by $0.81 million, or 133.2%, to $1.41 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 from $0.61 million for the same period of last year. Overall gross margin decreased by 2.5 percentage points to 8.7% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 11.2% for the same period of last year, due to lower margin in home improvement and furnishing projects as we offered more incentives to our subcontractors in the first half of 2017.\nGross margin for home improving and furnishing projects was 8.4% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, compared to 11.2% for the same period of last year.

In fiscal 2016, 8 branches were opened with 4 branches just in a trial operating period starting in the second half of fiscal 2016, while there were 9 operating branches in fiscal 2017. As a result, the associated salaries and benefits, rental expenses, office expenses, recruitment expenses and depreciation almost doubled from last year.\nSelling expenses increased by $8.56 million, or 81.2%, to $19.10 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 from $10.54 million for the same period of last year, primarily due to significant business expansion starting from the second half of 2016, in connection with which, more new branches and more showrooms were opened, intense advertising activities were conducted, and more sales personnel were hired. More showrooms and sales teams were set up to expand the home improvement service sector.\nResearch and development expenses increased by $0.73 million, or 140.4%, to $1.25 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 from $0.52 million for the same period of last year. Our research and development department was set up in the second half of fiscal 2016 and is mainly engaged in research and development activities on improvement of our mobile applications, software systems and development of new smart home products. Less research and development expense in fiscal 2016 was due to limited operating period.\nLoss from operations\nLoss from operations was $23.54 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $12.82 million for the same period of last year.\nNet loss\nNet losses were $23.72 million and $13.18 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The net loss reflects the significant operational costs incurred due to rapid expansion including additional rent paid by new branches and expenses associated with setting up additional sales teams. During the year ended December 31, 2017, a net loss incurred mainly due to significant efforts devoted to advertising activities in the second quarter of 2017 to promote our home furnishing service together with increased effort in building up the research and development department so as to develop more smart home products to widen our products range which are sold through online stores and distributors.\nFinancial Condition\nAs of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1.01 million, compared to $0.08 million as of December 31, 2016. Net cash used in operating activities was $22.04 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 which was primarily attributable to a net loss of approximately $23.7 million, compared to $13.18 million for the same period of last year. Net cash used in investing activities was $3.26 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 which was primarily attributable to $2.6 million spending on leasehold improvements for the office building and new branches, compared to $6.19 million for the same period of last year.
