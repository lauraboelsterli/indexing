    "text": "0 COMMENTS Good morning. We’re heading back into earnings season this week. First up is Google parent Alphabet, which is expected to report first-quarter earnings after the bell Monday. The search giant is applying new accounting standards that will result in changes to its earnings report. It’s also switching from reporting cost-per-click data to cost-per-impression metrics for its network business. On Wednesday we’ll hear from Facebook, which will likely provide an update on how the Cambridge Analytica problems and algorithm changes are impacting its business. Amazon reports Thursday and we might find out more detail about its advertising business. AT&T and Time Warner report this week, too.\nDon’t You Forget About Me Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal positions the social network at the center of concerns about how personal data is used and shared for the purposes of online advertising. The Journal’s Christopher Mims argues in his latest column that Google shouldn’t be left out of the debate, either. Google Analytics operates on tens of millions of websites, tracking users whether or not they are logged in. Google uses data ranging from users’ search history to their offline shopping habits in order to help marketers better target and measure the effectiveness of their ads. It also works with data brokers. So why doesn’t Google come up more in conversations about creepy data collecting? Maybe it’s a little easier to understand how ads work on Facebook, while the way Google’s various ad products work on third-party publisher websites and apps is wonkier. Plus, as Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, told Digiday in a separate article, “ Cambridge Analytica and Russians and the election makes [the issue of privacy] more sexy. ”\nThe Comeback Kid ComScore hasn’t had the smoothest of rides over the past few years. The media-measurement company has been without a CEO since November and has run up consecutive years of losses. You may also recall the SEC is investigating allegations of improper accounting practices. But now “the worst is behind us,” says Bryan Wiener, who comScore has tapped as its new chief executive , report CMO Today’s Alexandra Bruell and Suzanne Vranica. Mr. Wiener is currently the executive chairman of Dentsu-owned ad and media agency 360i and has been on comScore’s board since October 2017. ComScore’s next act will be a “comeback story,” according to Mr. Wiener, who is planning to streamline operations and focus on building products that support cross-platform measurement. Meanwhile, GroupM digital chief, Rob Norman, who is keeping himself busy since announcing his retirement last year with a range of board and advisory roles, has also joined comScore’s board.\nMySpace Oddity WSJ’s Jeffrey Trachtenberg reports a newsletter exclusive : Could MySpace soon have another new owner? Meredith Corp. is exploring the possible sale of Viant Technology, the parent of MySpace, according to people familiar with the situation. Meredith, through its acquisition earlier this year of Time Inc., owns 60% of the advertising technology company. In a regulatory filing in 2016, the former Time Inc. said that ​it paid about $87 million, net of cash acquired, for its stake in the business. A spokesman for Meredith declined comment. Meredith is also exploring the possible sale of four magazines: TIME: Fortune, Money, and Sports Illustrated. Viant-owned ad network Specific Media acquired MySpace from News Corp (parent company of The Wall Street Journal) in 2011 for $35 million—a fraction of the $580 million News Corp bought it for in 2005.\nIt Was a Little Bit Frightening, But They Fought With Expert Timing MoneySavingExpert.com founder Martin Lewis isn’t well-known outside of the U.K., where he’s often on television, enthusiastically offering consumer finance advice. But perhaps now Mr. Lewis will garner more attention across the pond: He said he is suing Facebook for defamation after it ran dozens of scammy, get-rich-quick-style ads using his image without permission. Mr. Lewis said the scammers are in a “lacuna of regulation” and that Facebook has failed to stop the ads repeatedly appearing. Facebook, in a statement, said it doesn’t allow ads that are misleading or false and that it’s promptly investigating Mr. Lewis’s requests. But Mr. Lewis is frustrated the onus is on him to keep making complaints. The Guardian points out that a defamation case against Facebook will have to establish the U.K. has jurisdiction and that the company is the publisher, which would be precedent-setting. Whether it makes it to court or not, Mr. Lewis’s complaint, which dominated U.K. media this morning, will draw widespread attention to the issue of scammers using false celebrity endorsements in their ads.\nBest of the rest Ford is putting parts of its advertising business under review, dealing a blow to WPP, the incumbent agency. Ford says WPP will have the opportunity to pitch and will remain the automaker’s agency of record in other areas. [ CMO Today ]\nFacebook plans to show pre-roll ads in more places across its platform, including in video search results or on a page timeline. [ Ad Age ]\nThe Association of National Advertisers says it is worried the Cambridge Analytica scandal will lead to rushed-through privacy laws. The ANA plans to join forces with a coalition opposing the proposed Consumer Right to Privacy Act, with the trade body’s executive vice president of government relations, Dan Jaffe, saying the California proposal would be “extraordinarily disadvantageous” for companies. [ MediaPost ]\nNike’s new “Shoe Therapy” campaign was inspired by a true story. [ Adweek ]\nA profile of Campbell Brown, the former television news anchor, who joined Facebook in 2017 to help its relationship with the news media. The piece reveals Facebook has a $90 million budget to spend on news shows.
