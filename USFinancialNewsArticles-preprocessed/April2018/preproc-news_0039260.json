    "text": "ATLANTA, April 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Chart Industries, Inc. (NASDAQ:GTLS), a leading diversified global manufacturer of highly engineered equipment for the industrial gas, energy and biomedical industries, today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018. Highlights include:\nOrders of $321.1 million sequentially increased 13% over the fourth quarter of 2017, and increased 35% organically compared to the first quarter of 2017 with each segments’ orders increasing both sequentially and year-over-year. Sales of $279.7 million increased 37% from the first quarter of 2017 (15.8% organically), and decreased 9% from the fourth quarter of 2017, representing typical seasonality. Reported EPS of $0.18 and adjusted EPS of $0.23, reflecting improved operational productivity and an effective tax rate of 26.7%. Gross margin as a percent of sales of 27.6% increased sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2017 gross margin as a percent of sales of 27.1%, and from 27.3% in the first quarter of 2017 reflecting completed restructuring benefits. A strategic review of the oxygen-related product lines within our Biomedical segment is underway.\nNet income for the first quarter of 2018 was $5.8 million or $0.18 per diluted share. First quarter 2018 earnings would have been $0.23 per diluted share excluding $1.3 million of transaction-related costs and $0.9 million of restructuring costs. This compares with a net loss for the first quarter of 2017 of $2.9 million, or ($0.09) per diluted share. First quarter 2017 earnings would have been $0.01 per diluted share excluding $4.6 million of restructuring and transaction-related costs. Further details on the first quarter results can be found in the attached exhibit to the press release.\nOrder activity continues to be strong across all segments. This is our fifth consecutive quarter of sequential order growth, with 13% growth over the fourth quarter of 2017. Orders increased 53%, or $111.4 million ($74.4 million excluding Hudson Products) above the first quarter of 2017. The first quarter of 2018 continued to reflect the strong demand seen in 2017 for natural gas projects in both petrochemical and LNG export, with equipment orders received primarily for the West Texas Permian Basin. Our Energy & Chemicals (“E&C”) segment had a sequential increase in orders over the fourth quarter of 2017 of 24.6% and included four orders greater than $2 million each. Distribution & Storage (“D&S”) had sequential order growth of 11.2% over the fourth quarter of 2017, and was driven by continued strength in packaged gas and LNG vehicle tanks. First quarter 2018 orders in D&S of $170.4 million was the highest quarter since the third quarter of 2013. In our BioMedical segment, orders sequentially increased 2.1% over the fourth quarter and 10.2% over the first quarter of 2017. Strength in orders for stainless Cryobiological freezers and oxygen-related products drove the BioMedical order growth.\nSales of $279.7 million for the first quarter of 2018 increased 37% (or 15.8% excluding Hudson Products) over the first quarter of 2017. All three segments’ sales increased over the prior year’s quarter, with D&S and BioMedical sales increasing 20.2% and 7.3%, respectively. Sequential to the fourth quarter of 2017, revenue was down 9%, driven by typical seasonality and an exceptionally strong fourth quarter of 2017.\nGross profit for the first quarter of 2018 was $77.1 million, or 27.6% of sales. Gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $82.9 million, or 27.1% of sales. The sequential increase in gross margin as a percent of sales reflects the first full quarter for each of the three segments benefiting from the 2017 restructuring actions taken.\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $54.1 million, inclusive of $1.3 million of transaction-related costs, $0.6 million of restructuring costs, and $3.2 million of share based compensation. SG&A expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $55.8 million, inclusive of $1.1 million of acquisition-related costs, $2.8 million of restructuring costs, and $3.4 million of China litigation expense. SG&A is expected to continue to decrease on a normalized basis throughout 2018.\nWe are conducting a strategic review of the oxygen-related product lines within our Biomedical segment, including an evaluation of a possible divestiture of the businesses. We are excluding from the review those portions of the BioMedical segment that utilize and align with our cryogenic technological expertise (Cryobiological). The asset group does not meet the criteria to be held for sale, and therefore continues to be accounted and reported for as assets to be held and used. There can be no assurance that this evaluation will result in any transaction being announced or consummated. The Company will not disclose further developments during this process until our Board of Directors has approved a specific action or we have determined that further disclosure is appropriate.\n“We are pleased with the start to 2018, both from a market and order perspective as well as the productivity results reflected in the margin in each of the segments,” stated Bill Johnson, Chart’s Chief Executive Officer and President. “Additionally, the strategic review of our oxygen-related product lines further supports our continued focus on analyzing our capital allocation and executing on our organic and inorganic key growth areas in core cryogenic equipment.”\nSEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS\nFirst quarter 2018 orders in E&C were $93.7 million, inclusive of $37.0 million from Hudson Products, and sequentially an increase of 24.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. This is the fourth quarter in a row with E&C order levels above $60 million. The natural gas and petrochemical markets continue to be strong, and LNG FEED and engineering activities continue to strengthen. E&C segment sales of $89.9 million ($46.6 million excluding Hudson) were organically down 1.5% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and up organically 16.7% versus the first quarter of 2017. The year-over-year sales increase is driven by natural gas demand, in particular in our air-cooled heat exchanger product line. The sequential revenue decrease is driven primarily by the fourth quarter of 2017 including several large project related shipments totaling $15 million. E&C gross margin of $19.4 million included $11.9 million from Hudson, and was 21.6% of sales.\nD&S sales decreased $14.1 million to $136.1 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, and increased $22.9 million compared to the first quarter of 2017. Year-over-year increases are driven by strength in United States packaged gas, China LNG trailers and vaporization stations, and European standard tanks. D&S order strength continued throughout 2017, and into the first quarter of 2018, with five consecutive quarters of sequential order growth in the segment. Gross margin as a percent of sales of 27.6% increased from 26.6% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 27.0% in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting continued improvement in our Chinese business as well as productivity efforts in the European and U.S. manufacturing locations.\nFirst quarter BioMedical sales of $54.7 million decreased from the fourth quarter of 2017 sales of $56.6 million driven primarily by the timing of specific shipments in the fourth quarter related to military applications and a specific larger Chinese Cryobiological order. Sequential revenue growth in each quarter for the remainder of 2018 is expected. Even with lower Cryobiological sales mix in the first quarter of 2018, BioMedical gross margin as a percent of sales of 36.9% increased 100 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017 and 420 basis points over the first quarter of 2017, which included $2.1 million of restructuring costs.\nOUTLOOK\nOur full year 2018 guidance includes the impact from the revenue recognition accounting standard change which was adopted effective January 1, 2018, and which we expect to be immaterial on a full year basis. Sales guidance is expected to be in the range of $1.15 billion to $1.20 billion for the full year of 2018. We expect full year adjusted earnings per diluted share (non-GAAP) to be in the range of $1.75 to $2.00 per share, on approximately 31.7 million weighted average shares outstanding. Our prior full year adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance was $1.65 to $1.90. This excludes any restructuring costs and transaction-related costs, and assumes continued ownership of all assets for the entire calendar year, and as such is a non-GAAP measure. We expect our effective tax rate, inclusive of benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, to be 27%, as compared to our prior guidance of a range of 27% to 29%. We expect our capital expenditures for 2018 will be in the range of $35 million to $45 million.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements made in this news release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Adjusted earnings per diluted share is not a measure of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and should not be considered as an alternative to earnings per share in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Management believes that adjusted earnings per share facilitates useful period-to-period comparisons of our financial results and this information is used by us in evaluating internal performance. Our calculation of this non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to the calculations of similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nSource:Chart Industries, Inc.",
