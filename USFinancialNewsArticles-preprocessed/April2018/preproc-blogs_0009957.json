    "text": "GDP outlook Private payrolls grow by 241K in February vs. 205K est.: ADP/Moody's Analytics Private companies added 241,000 positions in March as employment in construction and manufacturing surged, according to ADP and Moody's Analytics. The report was well ahead of Wall Street estimates for 205,000 growth and marked the fifth straight month that private payroll growth topped 200,000. S ervice providers added 176,000 new jobs while goods-producing industries contributed 65,000. \"The job market is rip-roaring,\" says Mark Zandi, Moody's Analytics' chief economist.

On a year-over-year basis, March 2018 nearly doubled the 122,000 total from the previous year. \n\"The job market is rip-roaring,\" Mark Zandi, Moody's Analytics' chief economist, said in a statement. \"Monthly job growth remains firmly over 200,000, double the pace of labor force growth. The tight labor market continues to tighten.\" \nJob gains were broad-based, spread across both business size and sector. \nService providers added 176,000 while goods-producing industries contributed 65,000. Construction and manufacturing led the latter category, adding 31,000 and 29,000 respectively. \nOn the services side, professional and business led with 44,000, while trade, transportation and utilities was next with 40,000. Health care and social assistance added 28,000 while leisure and hospitality grew by 26,000. \nMedium-sized firms, with 50 to 499 employees, were the top jobs producers with 127,000 new hires, while large firms added 67,000 and small businesses rose by 47,000. \nThe ADP/Moody's report comes two days ahead of the closely watched nonfarm payrolls report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Wall Street is looking for growth of about 185,000 and a decline in the unemployment rate to 4 percent from 4.1 percent. \nHowever, a strong ADP report sometimes can cause economists to adjust their numbers. The two counts sometimes differ significantly, though for February the BLS reported that private payrolls grew by 233,000, just 13,000 below the revised ADP number and 2,000 below the originally reported 235,000.",
