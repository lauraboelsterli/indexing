    "text": "April 2, 2018 / 5:37 PM / Updated 42 minutes ago Allegri says Dybala will shine for Juventus against Real Reuters Staff 3 Min Read \nTURIN, Italy (Reuters) - Juventus playmaker Paulo Dybala is stronger mentally than before and is ready to shine against Real Madrid in Tuesday’s Champions League tie, coach Massimiliano Allegri said on Monday. Soccer Football - Champions League - Real Madrid Training - Allianz Stadium, Turin, Italy - April 2, 2018 Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane during training REUTERS/Max Rossi \nThe Argentine is one of the most gifted players in Serie A but has had an up-and-down season. He began with a flourish, scoring two hat-tricks in Juve’s first four league games, but then suffered a loss of form and was dropped for two games in December. \nA hamstring injury also kept him out for several matches but he is now back to his best and scored a stunning goal in the 3-1 win over AC Milan on Saturday. \n“Paulo will have a great match because he is fit, he is serene and, mentally, he has improved greatly,” said Allegri as he gave the 24-year-old a vote of confidence ahead of the quarter-final first leg in Turin. Soccer Football - Champions League - Juventus Press Conference - Allianz Stadium, Turin, Italy - April 2, 2018 Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri during the press conference REUTERS/Massimo Pinca \nThe tie is a re-match of last season’s final and Allegri said his team had learned from their 4-1 defeat in Cardiff last June. \n“Cardiff was a lesson in the overall growth of this team, especially in how to approach these matches in a serene manner,” he said.

The ideal scenario would be to score and not concede a goal.” \nReal Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane dismissed any talk of comparisons with last year’s final. \n“This has nothing to do with happened 10 months ago,” he told reporters after being asked to draw a parallel with the match. \n“What happened has happened, but now we have to think about this game and make sure we play well tomorrow. \n“We mustn’t think about that or other matches against Juventus because it doesn’t mean anything.” \nReal have not had the best of seasons as they are third in La Liga and finished behind Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League group stage, but showed they are still a force to be reckoned with by beating Paris St Germain in the last 16.
