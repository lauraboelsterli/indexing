    "text": "FRANKFURT, April 13 (Reuters) - Volkswagen hopes to raise 6 billion to 7 billion euros ($7.4-$8.6 billion) through a listing of its trucks and buses division, German magazine Der Spiegel reported, not citing where it obtained the information.\nVolkswagen aims to sell up to 25 percent of the business as part of the listing and keep a majority, the magazine said. Sources told Reuters earlier this week that Volkswagen is planning to list the division in the first quarter of next year.\nVolkswagen was not immediately available for comment. ($1 = 0.8121 euros) (Reporting by Christoph Steitz and Andreas Cremer Editing by Victoria Bryan)\n ",
