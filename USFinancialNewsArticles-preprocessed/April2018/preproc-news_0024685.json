    "text": "MOSCOW, April 12 (Reuters) - A Moscow court rejected an appeal by former economy minister Alexei Ulyukayev on Thursday and left his eight year jail sentence in place, a Reuters reporter at the court said.\nThe same court scrapped one condition of Ulyukayevâ€™s sentence that had barred him from occupying government positions for eight years.\nUlyukayev was found guilty in December of soliciting a $2 million bribe from Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin in return for approving the sale of state-controlled oil company Bashneft to Rosneft, something he initially opposed.\nUlyukayev denied wrongdoing, saying he had been set up.
