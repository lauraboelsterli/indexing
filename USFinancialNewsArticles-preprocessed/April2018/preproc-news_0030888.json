    "text": "April 15, 2018 / 9:48 AM / Updated an hour ago Storms head east after heavy snow in U.S. Midwest Rich McKay 3 Min Read \nATLANTA (Reuters) - Deadly slow-moving storms generating record or near-record snowfall and low temperatures in the U.S. Midwest moved eastward on Sunday, leaving stranded airline travelers and thousands without power. \nIn Michigan, where snowfall was expected to reach 18 inches (46 cm) in some areas, about 310,000 homes and businesses were without power because of an ice storm, most of them in the southeast of the state. \nLarge areas of Detroit were without power and customers were not expected to have it back on Sunday night, utility DTE Energy ( DTE.N ) said. It was working to have 90 percent of outages restored by Tuesday, DTE spokeswoman Carly Getz said in a statement. \nThe weight of ice on power lines, coupled with high winds, caused more than 1,000 power lines to fall in Detroit and Wayne County, DTE said. \nThe worst of the snow was focused on the upper Great Lakes, with Green Bay, Wisconsin, seeing its second largest snowstorm ever after 23.2 inches (60 cm) fell as of Sunday afternoon, the National Weather Service said. \nFor the twin cities of Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, the April monthly record for snowfall of 21.8 inches (55 cm) was surpassed on Saturday, the National Weather Service said. \nTornado watches were in effect over the Carolinas, but no tornadoes had been reported by early Sunday afternoon, said National Weather Service meteorologist Brian Hurley. Slideshow (2 Images) \nThe storms stretched from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest and were moving into the Northeast and New England. \nRecord low temperatures for the date were expected in Oklahoma City on Monday at 30 degrees F (-1 C), and in Kansas City, Missouri, at 25 F (-4 C), Hurley said. \nOn Friday, the weather system produced 17 reports of tornadoes in Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri and Texas, with four people injured and 160 buildings damaged in a possible tornado in northwest Arkansas, local media reported. \nThe weather was blamed for two traffic deaths in western Nebraska and Wisconsin, according to National Public Radio. \nThe storms also killed a 1-year-old girl when a tree fell on a recreational vehicle where she was sleeping, the sheriffâ€™s office in Bossier Parish, Louisiana, said. \nBy Sunday afternoon, 1,689 flights had been canceled into or out of U.S. airports, the website flightaware.com reported, including 134 flights in or out of the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport.
