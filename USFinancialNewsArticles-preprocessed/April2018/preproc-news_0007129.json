    "text": "LONDON, April 5 (Reuters) - Russiaâ€™s ambassador to Britain said Moscow would accept the results of tests by international chemical weapons inspectors on a suspected nerve agent used to poison a former Russian spy in England but only if the process was transparent.\nAlexander Yakovenko told reporters at a news conference on Thursday that Russia wanted to know which experts were involved in the tests on the toxin used in March 4 attack on Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in the city of Salisbury.\nThe Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, a global chemical weapons watchdog, is investigating the case.
