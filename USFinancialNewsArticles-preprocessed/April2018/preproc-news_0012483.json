    "text": "MILAN, April 8 (Reuters) - Proxy adviser Glass Lewis has recommended Telecom Italia (TIM) investors back a proposal by activist fund Elliott to replace six board members and shake up the way top shareholder Vivendi runs the phone group, a document showed.\nElliott, which wants to improve governance and performance at TIM, has built a potential holding of 5.7 percent in the company. Last month, it called for six Vivendi-nominated board members, including TIM Chairman and Vivendi CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine, to be replaced through a vote on April 24.\nGlass Lewis also recommended that shareholders vote in favour of Amos Genish serving as the phone groupâ€™s chief executive for the next two years.\nGenish was co-opted by the board last September following the resignation of his predecessor, but his appointment has to be approved by shareholders to continue beyond the April AGM.
