In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as “believe”, “intend”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “project”, “forecast”, “plan”, “potential”, “may”, “should”, “could” and “expect” and similar expressions. These statements are not historical facts but instead represent only the Company’s belief regarding future results, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of the Company’s control. It is possible that actual results may differ, possibly materially, from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and important factors that could affect future results, see the discussion in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 20-F (File No. 001-34934) under the caption “Risk Factors”.\nCompany Contacts:\nGregory Zikos - Chief Financial Officer\nKonstantinos Tsakalidis - Business Development, Investor Relations\nCostamare Inc., Monaco\nTel: (+377) 93 25 09 40\nEmail: ir@costamare.com\nSource:Costamare Inc",
