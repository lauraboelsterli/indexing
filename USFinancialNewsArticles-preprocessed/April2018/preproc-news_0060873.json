    "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn., April 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fred’s Inc. (“Fred’s” or “Company”) (NASDAQ:FRED) today announced the resignation of Chief Executive Officer Michael K. Bloom, effective as of April 24, 2018, to pursue other opportunities. Joseph Anto, the Company’s current Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, will serve as Interim Chief Executive Officer effective as of April 24, 2018. Mr. Bloom also resigned from the Company’s board of directors. His resignation was not the result of any disagreement with the Company or its operations.\nHeath Freeman, Chairman of the Board said: “The Board is appreciative for Mike’s contributions, dedication and service. Mike joined Fred’s with significant experience with retail drugstores. After the Company was not able to purchase certain assets from the Rite Aid Corporation and following the end of the 2017 fiscal year, the timing was right, both for Mike and the Company, for him to step down. We wish him the very best. The Fred’s Board is confident that Mr. Anto will serve the Company well as Interim CEO.”\nAbout Joseph Anto\nMr. Anto has served as the Company’s Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary since February 2018.
