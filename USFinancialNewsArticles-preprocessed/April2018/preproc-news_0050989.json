    "text": "SANTA MONICA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- JAKKS Pacific, Inc. [NASDAQ: JAKK] today reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nNet sales for the first quarter were $93.0 million compared to $94.5 million reported in the comparable period in 2017. The net loss attributable to JAKKS Pacific for the first quarter was $36.2 million, or $1.57 per diluted share. This compares to a net loss attributable to JAKKS Pacific of $18.3 million, or $1.01 per diluted share, reported in the comparable period in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was negative $14.6 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of negative $10.6 million in the 2017 first quarter. See note below on “Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information.”\nGross margin in the first quarter was 24.7%, down from 31.8% last year as a result of reserves for anticipated contractual royalty shortfalls attributed to the recently announced liquidation of Toys R Us and higher royalties resulting from a shift in product mix.\nManagement Commentary\nJAKKS Chairman and CEO Stephen Berman stated, “We are relatively pleased with our sales in the first quarter despite the negative impact caused by the liquidation of Toys R Us which began near the end of the quarter. Despite this sales disruption, we saw several areas of strength, including Incredibles 2, Disguise® Costumes, Tangled: The Series, Squish-Dee-Lish and DC Toddler Dolls.\n“The investments in C’est Moi™ and Morfboard™ are off to a great start and sales are growing rapidly week after week. Our Morfboard product line, for example, has become the No.1 selling scooter at Target, and we are seeing strong upselling in various components and accessories both in store and online.\n“As we look ahead to the next few quarters, we will continue to focus on margin improvement and our long term strategic goals. Our fall lines are moving forward as planned and we have a strong line-up of new product introductions that are a balanced mix of owned IP and licensed brands, including Morfboard Xtensions, Real Workin’ Buddies™ Mr. Banks, Pop A Zit™, Fancy Nancy, Harry Potter, Incredibles 2, and Mega Man,” said Berman.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company’s cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash) totaled $46.8 million as of March 31, 2018 compared to $65.0 million at December 31, 2017, and $68.0 million as of March 31, 2017.\n2018 Outlook\nWhile the Company anticipates some market disruption in the United States and internationally related to the Toys R Us bankruptcy and liquidation, the Company expects that its financial results will improve overall in 2018 when compared to 2017.\nConvertible Senior Note Retirement\nThe Company continues to make a high priority the retirement of the remaining $21 million of its convertible senior notes that mature on August 1, 2018.\nExpression of Interest from Hong Kong Meisheng Cultural Company Limited\nOn January 25, 2018, Hong Kong Meisheng Cultural Company Limited (“Meisheng”) sent the Company a letter expressing an interest in buying additional shares to bring its holdings to 51% of our shares. A committee of independent members of our Board of Directors continues to evaluate Meisheng’s expression of interest as well as other possible interests.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to the preliminary results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP included in this release, the Company has provided certain non-GAAP financial information including Adjusted EBITDA which is a non-GAAP metric that excludes various items that are detailed in the financial tables and accompanying footnotes reconciling GAAP to non-GAAP results contained in this release. Management believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors because the information may allow investors to better evaluate ongoing business performance and certain components of the Company’s results. In addition, the Company believes that the presentation of these financial measures enhances an investor’s ability to make period-to-period comparisons of the Company’s operating results. This information should be considered in addition to the results presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered a substitute for the GAAP results. The Company has reconciled the non-GAAP financial information included in this release to the nearest GAAP measures. See the attached “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information.”\nConference Call Live Webcast\nJAKKS Pacific will webcast its first quarter earnings call at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time/6:00 a.m. Pacific Time today.

The non-GAAP financial measures included in the press release are reconciled to the corresponding GAAP financial measures below, as required under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We define Adjusted EBITDA as income (loss) from operations before depreciation, amortization and adjusted for certain non-recurring and non-cash charges, such as reorganization expenses and restricted stock compensation expense. Net income (loss) is similarly adjusted and tax-effected to arrive at Adjusted Net Income (Loss). Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) are not recognized financial measures under GAAP, but we believe that they are useful in measuring our operating performance. We believe that the use of the non-GAAP financial measures enhances an overall understanding of the Company's past financial performance, and provides useful information to the investor by comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis.\nInvestors should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for net income, operating income, or any other measure for determining the Company's operating performance that is calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because these measures are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n(In thousands)\nNet loss\n$\n(36,193\n)\n$\n(18,285\n)\nIncome from joint ventures\n(22\n)\n-\nOther income\n(50\n)\n(23\n)\nInterest income (14\n)\n(4\n)\nInterest expense 1,936\n2,932\nBenefit from income taxes\n(2,336\n)\n(344\n)\nDepreciation and amortization\n3,096\n4,380\nRestricted stock compensation expense\n676\n748\nBad debt write-offs\n13,794\n-\nChange in fair value of convertible senior notes\n1,021\n-\nMinimum guarantee shortfalls\n3,468\n-\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n(14,624\n)\n$\n(10,596\n)\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2018\n2017\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nNet loss attributable to JAKKS Pacific, Inc.\n$\n(36,244\n)\n$\n(18,316\n)\nRestricted stock compensation expense\n676\n748\nBad debt write-offs\n13,794\n-\nChange in fair value of convertible senior notes\n1,021\n-\nMinimum guarantee shortfalls\n3,468\n-\nTax impact of additional changes\n(2,348\n)\n-\nAdjusted net loss attributable to JAKKS Pacific, Inc.\n(19,633\n)\n(17,568\n)\nAdjusted loss per share - basic and diluted\n$\n(0.85\n)\n$\n(0.97\n)\nShares used in adjusted loss per share - basic and diluted\n23,100\n18,104\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180426005591/en/\nJAKKS Pacific\nBrent Novak, (424) 268-9450\nChief Financial Officer\nor\nRachel Griffin, (424) 268-9553\nVice President, Communications\nor\nLiolios Investor Relations\nSean McGowan, (949) 574-3860\nManaging Director\nJAKK@liolios.com\nSource: JAKKS Pacific, Inc.",
