    "text": "The New York Stock Exchange briefly posted a Swiss flag on Tuesday in honor of Spotify's public offering — even though the company is based in Sweden, not Switzerland.\nTweet: In an attempt to honor Swedish Spotify going public, the New York Stock Exchange of course puts up a Swiss flag. \nThe NYSE acknowledged the flub on Twitter and in a light-hearted statement to CNBC. The error was corrected, and most pictures captured by official photographers show American flags.\nLucas Jackson | Reuters Pedestrians walk past a banner with the Spotify logo on the New York Stock Exchange, April 3, 2018. \"It was a momentary ode to our neutrality in the process of price discovery,\" a reference to Switzerland's reputation for neutrality in foreign military conflicts . Mixing up Sweden and Switzerland has been publicized as a common irk for citizens of the countries. \nTweet from NYSE: We hope everyone enjoyed our momentary ode to our neutral role in the process of price discovery this morning \n\nTweet \nAs the NYSE implied, the process of price discovery for Spotify's shares has been in the spotlight. The company is not engaging in the traditional roadshow with major investors, which usually helps gauge a more formal baseline price before the stock is offered to the public.\nSpotify, which is headquartered in Stockholm, is expected to start trading on Tuesday under the symbol \"SPOT.\"",
