A global Phase III trial intended to support a future U.S. Biologic License Application (BLA) started in 2017. TiGenix has entered into a licensing agreement with Takeda, a global pharmaceutical company active in gastroenterology, under which Takeda acquired the exclusive right to develop and commercialize Alofisel for complex perianal fistulas outside the U.S. TiGenix’ second adipose-derived product, Cx611, is undergoing a Phase I/II trial in severe sepsis – a major cause of mortality in the developed world. TiGenix is headquartered in Leuven (Belgium) and has operations in Madrid (Spain) and Cambridge, MA (USA). For more information, please visit http://www.tigenix.com .\nAbout Alofisel (darvadstrocel)\nAlofisel is an administration of allogeneic (or donor derived) expanded adipose-derived stem cells (eASCs) for the treatment of complex perianal fistulas in adult patients with non-active/mildly active luminal Crohn’s disease that have previously shown an inadequate response to at least one conventional therapy or biologic therapy. Crohn’s disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestine and complex perianal fistulas are a severe and debilitating complication.\nAlofisel was granted orphan drug designation by the European Commission in 2009 and by the FDA in 2017. TiGenix completed a European Phase III clinical trial (ADMIRE-CD) in August 2015 in which the primary endpoint was met, with a significantly greater proportion of patients treated with Alofisel (50%, n=107) versus control (34%, n=105) achieving combined remission as defined by clinical assessment of closure of all treated external openings that were draining at baseline and absence of collections > 2 cm of the treated perianal fistulas confirmed by masked central MRI at week 24 (97·5% CI 0·2-30·3; p=0·024). 1 The most commonly reported treatment emergent adverse events were proctalgia, anal abscess and nasopharyngitis. A follow-up analysis was completed showing that the efficacy and safety profile of Alofisel were maintained at 52 weeks. 2 The 24-week results of the Phase III ADMIRE-CD trial were published in The Lancet in July 2016. 1\nA global Phase III clinical trial (ADMIRE-CD II) intended to support a future U.S. Biologic License Application (BLA) started in 2017, based on a trial protocol that has been agreed with the U.S. FDA through a special protocol assessment procedure (SPA) ( clinicaltrials.gov ; NCT03279081). ADMIRE-CD II is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to confirm the efficacy and safety of a single administration of Alofisel for the treatment of complex perianal fistulas in Crohn's disease patients. In July 2016, TiGenix entered into a licensing agreement with Takeda, a global pharmaceutical company active in gastroenterology, under which Takeda acquired exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Alofisel for complex perianal fistulas in Crohn’s patients outside of the U.S.\nForward-looking information\nThis press release may contain forward-looking statements and estimates with respect to the anticipated future performance of TiGenix and the market in which it operates and statements regarding the expected consummation of the tender offer, which involves a number of risks and uncertainties, including the satisfaction of closing conditions for the tender offer, the possibility that the transaction will not be completed, the impact of general economic, industry, market or political conditions, and the other risks and uncertainties discussed in TiGenix’s public filings with the SEC, including the “Risk Factors” section of TiGenix’s Form 20-F filed on April 16, 2018, as well as the tender offer documents to be filed by Takeda and the solicitation/recommendation statement to be filed by TiGenix.
