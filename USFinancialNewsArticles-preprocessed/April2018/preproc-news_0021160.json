    "text": "April 11, 2018 / 8:05 PM / Updated an hour ago In call with Saudi king, Trump demanded quick end to Gulf rift: U.S. officials Warren Strobel , John Walcott 3 Min Read \nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a phone call this month with Saudi Arabia’s King Salman, U.S. President Donald Trump demanded that the kingdom and its Arab partners quickly end a nearly year-old dispute with Qatar that has left U.S. allies in the region fractured, according to two U.S. officials briefed on the conversation. Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud attends Riyadh International Humanitarian Forum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia February 26, 2018. REUTERS/Faisal Al Nasser \nTrump wants the rift healed to restore unity among Arab Gulf states and present a united front against Iran, said the officials, who requested anonymity to discuss high-level diplomatic communications. \nTrump’s tone in the April 2 call with Salman was described by one official as “forceful.” It was not clear what the king’s response was. \n“The president’s focus has always been on Iran, and its nuclear and missile programs that threaten all the Gulf states, as well as Israel, and he stressed that the feud the Saudis and Emirates are having with Qatar makes no sense,” the official said. \nSpokeswomen for the White House and the Saudi embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. \nSaudi Arabia, the Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut off travel and trade ties with Qatar last June, accusing it of backing their arch-rival, Iran, and supporting terrorism. Qatar denies the charges and says the boycott impinges on its sovereignty. \nA second official knowledgeable about the call said Trump insisted that the rift within the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council be patched up within three weeks, in part because of a looming decision on Iran. U.S. President Donald Trump looks up before signing H.R. 1865 \"The Allow States and Victims To Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act\" at the White House in Washington, U.S., April 11, 2018. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque \nTrump has set a May 12 deadline for European powers to commit to improving the 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, or he will pull Washington out of the deal. \nTrump also faces a potential confrontation with Tehran in Syria, where he has accused President Bashar al-Assad’s Iranian-backed government of using poison gas on his own people in an assault Saturday. Trump on Wednesday appeared to threaten an imminent retaliatory missile strike in Syria. \nIt remains to be seen whether Trump’s Gulf pressure campaign will work. Outwardly, there is little sign of a rapprochement between Qatar and its Gulf Arab neighbors. \nA written White House readout of Trump’s phone call with Salman said that the U.S. president “emphasized the importance of resolving the Gulf dispute and restoring a united Gulf Cooperation Council to counter Iranian malign influence and defeat terrorists and extremists.” \nThe readout, however, did not recount Trump’s tough tone or describe a U.S. deadline for resolving the dispute. \nTrump also discussed the dispute in an April 6 phone call with Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, and in a White House meeting on Tuesday with Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamid al-Thani. \nThe U.S. president’s demand for swift action to end the rift represents a shift. Early in the crisis, he publicly sided with the Saudis and Emiratis, complicating then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s attempts to mediate.
