    "text": "ISTANBUL, April 11 (Reuters) - Emirates NBD’s talks to acquire Turkey’s Denizbank continue and both sides are discussing the shareholder agreement now, Denizbank’s chief executive said on Wednesday.\nHakan Ates made the comment to reporters at an event in Istanbul. He also said that all necessary transactions on the Denizbank side had been completed, without elaborating further.\nReuters reported last month that Emirates NBD could agree to buy Denizbank from Russia’s Sberbank soon, after intense lobbying by Ates to convince President Tayyip Erdogan of the benefits of the potential $5.3 billion deal, despite a diplomatic rift.
