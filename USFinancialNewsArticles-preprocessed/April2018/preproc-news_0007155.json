    "text": "(Reuters) - George Soros’s $26 billion hedge fund is planning to trade cryptocurrencies, Bloomberg reported on Friday, months after the billionaire investor called the virtual currency a bubble.\nRepresentations of the Ripple, Bitcoin, Etherum and Litecoin virtual currencies are seen on a PC motherboard in this illustration picture, February 14, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration Adam Fisher, who oversees macro investing at the New York-based Soros Fund Management, got internal approval to trade digital assets in the last few months, though was yet to make a wager, the report here said, citing people familiar with the matter.\nA Soros representative declined to comment.\nThe financial world has been divided about betting on bitcoin BTC=BTSP , a digital token.\nBillionaire Warren Buffett and JPMorgan’s ( JPM.N ) Jamie Dimon have said they will not invest in cryptocurrencies, while Wall Street banks Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) have been open to clearing bitcoin futures.\nLast year, Soros’s hedge fund took an 8.99 percent stake in Overstock.com Inc ( OSTK.O ) to become the third-largest shareholder in the online retailer. The shares of the company surged when its unit held an initial coin offering.\nReporting by Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur\n ",
