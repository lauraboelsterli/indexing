    "text": "0 COMMENTS Navex Global looked at the performance of whistleblower hotlines. Photo: iStockphoto.com/Jason Reekie\nMore claims by whistleblowers are proving true when companies look into the issues raised, and fewer tipsters are telling their employers they faced retaliation, according to research released Tuesday that draws on data from thousands of companies.\nForty-four percent of the 900,000 claims included in a benchmarking report on the use of employee hotlines proved correct, said Navex Global, a provider of ethics and compliance software and services. That compares with a median rate of substantiation of 40% in 2016.\nData from almost 2,400 companies whose hotlines received 10 or more complaints was included in the results, the firm said.\n“The increase in substantiated reports is notable and is an indication of maturing programs,” said Carrie Penman, chief compliance office and senior vice president for advisory services at Navex Global. “Higher-quality, more actionable reports are coming into hotlines and other reporting channels, which in turn allows for more thorough investigations.”\nAt the same time, though, the percentage of reports alleging retaliation against employees declined to 0.66% from 0.93% in 2016.\nA lack of retaliation claims may lull executives and compliance staff into a false sense of security, said Navex Global. “But low reporting of retaliation concerns doesn’t mean that it isn’t happening,” said Ms. Penman. “Organizations, including their boards of directors,” need to tackle the issue.\nThe time it took companies to resolve claims increased slightly: The median number of days needed to close an employee’s claim rose to 44 from 42 in 2016.\nThat is reason for concern, said Scott M. Nelson, an employment lawyer at Baker & McKenzie LLP who spoke with Ms. Penman on a webinar discussing the Navex Global report. “Honestly, most employee claims should be resolved within a week or two,” he said, though some can take longer due to the complexity of an issue or difficulty reaching people involved.\nWrite to Henry Cutter at Henry.Cutter@wsj.com.
