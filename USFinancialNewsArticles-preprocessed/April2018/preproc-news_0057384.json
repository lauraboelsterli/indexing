    "text": "April 27, 2018 / 4:00 AM / Updated an hour ago Japan's March steel exports to U.S. slump 38 percent - federation Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nTOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s steel exports to the United States dipped 38.2 percent in March from a year earlier due to a sharp slide in export of semi-finished products, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation said on Friday. Chimneys of a steel factory are pictured at an industrial area in Kawasaki, Japan, January 16, 2017. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon\nIts overall steel exports dropped 2.5 percent, the federation said.\nThe decline comes as the United States imposed 25 percent import duties on steel last month. The U.S. government provided a temporary exemption until May 1 for the European Union and six other nations, but not Japan.\nSteel exports to the United States slipped 14.5 percent in the financial year ended March 31 from a year earlier to 1.78 million tonnes, their lowest in seven years, the federation said.\nOverall steel exports from the world’s second-biggest steel producer fell 7.3 percent for the year.
