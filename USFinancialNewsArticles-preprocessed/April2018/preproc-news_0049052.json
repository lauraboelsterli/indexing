    "text": "DURHAM, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cree, Inc. (Nasdaq: CREE) today announced financial results for its third quarter of fiscal 2018, ended March 25, 2018. Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $356 million, which represents a 4% increase compared to revenue of $342 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. GAAP net loss for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $241 million, or $2.40 per diluted share, which includes impairment charges of $247.5 million attributable to Cree’s Lighting Products segment. This compares to a GAAP net loss of $99 million, or $1.02 per diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $3.8 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 of $0.7 million, or $0.01 per diluted share.\n“The third quarter revenues and gross margins were at the top end of our targeted range, and non-GAAP earnings per share exceeded the top end of our range, with each business showing progress,\" stated Gregg Lowe, Cree CEO. \"While we still have a lot of work to do and the progress won’t happen in a straight line, Q3 was a good first step and we are committed to executing our new strategic direction going forward.\"\nBusiness Outlook :\nFor its fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 ending June 24, 2018, Cree targets revenue in a range of $390 million to $410 million. GAAP net loss is targeted at $34 million to $38 million, or $0.34 to $0.38 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income is targeted to be in a range of $5 million to $9 million, or $0.05 to $0.09 earnings per diluted share. Targeted non-GAAP income excludes $43 million of expenses, net of tax, related to stock-based compensation expense, the amortization or impairment of acquisition-related intangibles, the amortization of the inventory basis step-up from the Infineon RF Power acquisition, transition and integration costs associated with the Infineon RF Power acquisition and charges associated with the restructuring of our Lighting Products business. The GAAP and non-GAAP targets do not include any estimated change in the fair value of Cree’s Lextar investment.\nQuarterly Conference Call:\nCree will host a conference call at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time today to review the highlights of the fiscal 2018 third quarter results and the fiscal 2018 fourth quarter business outlook, including significant factors and assumptions underlying the targets noted above.\nThe conference call will be available to the public through a live audio web broadcast via the internet.

This press release contains involving risks and uncertainties, both known and unknown, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the . Actual results, including with respect to our targets and prospects, could differ materially due to a number of factors, including the risk that we may not obtain sufficient orders to achieve our targeted revenues; price competition in key markets; the risk that we or our channel partners are not able to develop and expand customer bases and accurately anticipate demand from end customers, which can result in increased inventory and reduced orders as we experience wide fluctuations in supply and demand; the risk that our commercial Lighting Products results will continue to suffer if new issues arise regarding issues related to product quality for this business; the risk that we may experience production difficulties that preclude us from shipping sufficient quantities to meet customer orders or that result in higher production costs and lower margins; our ability to lower costs; the risk that our results will suffer if we are unable to balance fluctuations in customer demand and capacity, including bringing on additional capacity on a timely basis to meet customer demand; the risk that longer manufacturing lead times may cause customers to fulfill their orders with a competitor’s products instead; the risk that the economic and political uncertainty caused by the proposed tariffs by the United States on Chinese goods, and any corresponding Chinese tariffs in response, may negatively impact demand for our products; product mix; risks associated with the ramp-up of production of our new products, and our entry into new business channels different from those in which we have historically operated; the risk that customers do not maintain their favorable perception of our brand and products, resulting in lower demand for our products; the risk that our products fail to perform or fail to meet customer requirements or expectations, resulting in significant additional costs, including costs associated with warranty returns or the potential recall of our products; ongoing uncertainty in global economic conditions, infrastructure development or customer demand that could negatively affect product demand, collectability of receivables and other related matters as consumers and businesses may defer purchases or payments, or default on payments; risks resulting from the concentration of our business among few customers, including the risk that customers may reduce or cancel orders or fail to honor purchase commitments; the risk that we are not able to enter into acceptable contractual arrangements with the significant customers of the acquired Infineon RF Power business or otherwise not fully realize anticipated benefits of the transaction; the risk that retail customers may alter promotional pricing, increase promotion of a competitor’s products over our products or reduce their inventory levels, all of which could negatively affect product demand; the risk that our investments may experience periods of significant stock price volatility causing us to recognize fair value losses on our investment; the risk posed by managing an increasingly complex supply chain that has the ability to supply a sufficient quantity of raw materials, subsystems and finished products with the required specifications and quality; the risk we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill or amortizable assets become impaired; risks relating to confidential information theft or misuse, including through cyber-attacks or cyber intrusion; our ability to complete development and commercialization of products under development, such as our pipeline of Wolfspeed products, improved LED chips, LED components, and LED lighting products risks related to our multi-year warranty periods for LED lighting products; risks associated with acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures or investments generally; the rapid development of new technology and competing products that may impair demand or render our products obsolete; the potential lack of customer acceptance for our products; risks associated with ongoing litigation; and other factors discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including our report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 25, 2017, and subsequent reports filed with the SEC. These represent Cree’s judgment as of the date of this release. Except as required under the U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, Cree disclaims any intent or obligation to update any after the date of this release, whether as a

except percentages)\nThe following table reflects the results of the Company’s reportable segments as reviewed by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, its Chief Operating Decision Maker or CODM, for the three and nine months ended March 25, 2018 and the three and nine months ended March 26, 2017. The CODM does not review inter-segment transactions when evaluating segment performance and allocating resources to each segment. As such, total segment revenue is equal to the Company’s consolidated revenue.\nThree Months Ended March 25,\n2018\nMarch 26,\n2017\nChange Wolfspeed revenue $81,902 $56,133 $25,769 46 % Percent of revenue 23 % 16 % LED Products revenue 143,298 131,327 11,971 9 % Percent of revenue 40 % 39 % Lighting Products revenue 130,758 154,045 (23,287 ) (15 )% Percent of revenue 37 % 45 % Total revenue $355,958 $341,505 $14,453 4 % Nine Months Ended March 25,\n2018\nMarch 26,\n2017\nChange Wolfspeed revenue $218,628 $160,401 $58,227 36 % Percent of revenue 20 % 14 % LED Products revenue 440,500 406,858 33,642 8 % Percent of revenue 41 % 37 % Lighting Products revenue 425,098 546,805 (121,707 ) (22 )% Percent of revenue 39 % 49 % Total revenue $1,084,226 $1,114,064 ($29,838 ) (3 )% Three Months Ended March 25,\n2018\nMarch 26,\n2017\nChange Wolfspeed gross profit $39,285 $26,396 $12,889 49 % Wolfspeed gross margin 48.0 % 47.0 % LED Products gross profit 37,764 32,385 5,379 17 % LED Products gross margin 26.4 % 24.7 % Lighting Products gross profit 24,956 35,355 (10,399 ) (29 )% Lighting Products gross margin 19.1 % 23.0 % Unallocated costs (2,949 ) (3,459 ) 510 15 % Depreciation and amortization adjustment — (4,601 ) 4,601 100 % Consolidated gross profit $99,056 $86,076 $12,980 15 % Consolidated gross margin 27.8 % 25.2 % Nine Months Ended March 25,\n2018\nMarch 26,\n2017\nChange Wolfspeed gross profit $105,816 $74,737 $31,079 42 % Wolfspeed gross margin 48.4 % 46.6 % LED Products gross profit 115,180 115,499 (319 ) — % LED Products gross margin 26.1 % 28.4 % Lighting Products gross profit 79,803 159,415 (79,612 ) (50 )% Lighting Products gross margin 18.8 % 29.2 % Unallocated costs (8,808 ) (13,077 ) 4,269 33 % Depreciation and amortization adjustment — — — — % Consolidated gross profit $291,991 $336,574 ($44,583 ) (13 )% Consolidated gross margin 26.9 % 30.2 % For the three and nine months ended March 26, 2017, the Wolfspeed segment was presented as discontinued operations. The depreciation and amortization adjustment in the table above represents the depreciation and amortization that would have been recognized in prior periods had the Wolfspeed assets been continuously classified as held and used from July 16, 2016 through March 26, 2017. These costs were not allocated to the reportable segments’ gross profit for the three months ended March 26, 2017 because they represent an adjustment which does not provide comparability to the corresponding prior period and therefore were not reviewed by the CODM when evaluating segment performance and allocating resources. These costs were allocated to the Wolfspeed segment’s gross profit for the nine months ended March 26, 2017 because they provide comparability to the corresponding prior period and were reviewed by the CODM when evaluating segment performance and allocating resources.\nReportable Segments Description\nThe Company’s Wolfspeed segment includes power devices, RF devices, and SiC materials. The Company’s LED Products segment includes LED chips and LED components. The Company’s Lighting Products segment primarily consists of LED lighting systems and lamps.\nFinancial Results by Reportable Segment\nThe Company’s CODM reviews gross profit as the lowest and only level of segment profit. As such, all items below gross profit in the consolidated statements of loss must be included to reconcile the consolidated gross profit presented in the preceding table to the Company’s consolidated loss before taxes.\nThe Company allocates direct costs and indirect costs to each segment’s cost of revenue. The allocation methodology is based on a reasonable measure of utilization considering the specific facts and circumstances of the costs being allocated.\nCertain costs are not allocated when evaluating segment performance. These unallocated costs consist primarily of manufacturing employees’ stock-based compensation, expenses for profit sharing and quarterly or annual incentive plans, matching contributions under the Company’s 401(k) Plan, and acquisition related costs.\nNon-GAAP Measures of Financial Performance\nTo supplement the Company’s consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, Cree uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP non-operating income, net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP diluted (loss) earnings per share and free cash flow.\nReconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure of all historical non-GAAP measures included in this press release can be found in the tables included with this press release. In this press release, Cree also presents its target for non-GAAP expenses, which are expenses less expenses in the various categories described below. Both our GAAP targets and non-GAAP targets do not include any estimated changes in the fair value of our Lextar investment.\nNon-GAAP measures presented in this press release are not in accordance with or an alternative to measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Non-GAAP measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with Cree’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should only be used to evaluate Cree’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures.\nCree believes that these non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, enhance investors’ and management’s overall understanding of the Company’s current financial performance and the Company’s prospects for the future, including cash flows available to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value. In addition, because Cree has historically reported certain non-GAAP results to investors, the Company believes the inclusion of non-GAAP measures provides consistency in the Company’s financial reporting.\nFor its internal budgeting process, and as discussed further below, Cree’s management uses financial statements that do not include the items listed below and the income tax effects associated with the foregoing. Cree’s management also uses non-GAAP measures, in addition to the corresponding GAAP measures, in reviewing the Company’s financial results.\nCree excludes the following items from one or more of its non-GAAP measures when applicable:\nStock-based compensation expense. This expense consists of expenses for stock options, restricted stock, performance stock awards and employee stock purchases through its ESPP. Cree excludes stock-based compensation expenses from its non-GAAP measures because they are non-cash expenses that Cree does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results.\nAmortization or impairment of acquisition-related intangibles. Cree incurs amortization or impairment of acquisition-related intangibles in connection with acquisitions. Cree excludes these items because they arise from Cree’s prior acquisitions and have no direct correlation to the ongoing operating results of Cree’s business.\nLED business restructuring charges or gains. In June 2015, Cree’s board of directors approved a plan to restructure the LED business. The restructuring, which was completed during fiscal 2016, reduced excess capacity and overhead in order to improve the cost structure moving forward. The components of the restructuring included the planned sale or abandonment of certain manufacturing equipment, facility consolidation and the elimination of certain positions. Because these charges relate to assets which have been retired prior to the end of their estimated useful lives and severance costs for eliminated positions, Cree does not consider these charges to be reflective of ongoing operating results. Similarly, Cree does not consider realized gains or losses on the sale of assets relating to the restructuring to be reflective of ongoing operating results.\nGoodwill impairment charges. The Company determined that the carrying value of the Lighting Products segment was in excess of the segment’s fair value during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 in connection with the preparation of the financial statements for such period, resulting in an impairment charge. Cree excludes this item from its non-GAAP measures because it is a non-cash expense that Cree does not believe to be reflective of ongoing operating results.\nTransaction, transition and integration costs associated with purchase of RF Power business. The Company incurred transaction, transition and integration costs in fiscal 2018 in conjunction with the purchase of certain assets of the Infineon Technologies AG RF Power (\"RF Power\") business. Cree excludes these items because they have no direct correlation to the ongoing operating results of Cree’s business.\nTransaction costs associated with the terminated sale of the Wolfspeed business. The Company incurred transaction costs in fiscal 2017 in conjunction with the previously proposed sale of its Wolfspeed business to Infineon. Because these costs were incurred relative to a portion of the business which was previously reported as discontinued operations in fiscal 2017, Cree does not consider these amounts to be reflective of ongoing operating results.\nSeverance pay associated with termination of key executive personnel. The Company incurred costs in fiscal 2018 in conjunction with the termination of key executive personnel. Cree excludes these items because they have no direct correlation to the ongoing operating results of Cree’s business.\nNet changes associated with equity investment. The Company’s common stock ownership investment in Lextar Electronics Corporation is accounted for utilizing the fair value option. As such, changes in fair value are recognized in income, including fluctuations due to the exchange rate between the New Taiwan Dollar and the United States Dollar. Cree excludes the impact of these gains or losses from its non-GAAP measures because they are non-cash impacts that Cree does not believe are reflective of ongoing operating results. Additionally, Cree excludes the impact of dividends received on its Lextar investment as Cree does not believe it is reflective of ongoing operating results.\nForeign exchange gain on acquisition of RF Power business. The Company incurred foreign exchange gains on hedges purchased for the RF Power business asset purchase. Cree excludes the impact of this gain because it is not considered to be reflective of ongoing operations.\nIncome tax effects of the foregoing non-GAAP items. This amount is used to present each of the amounts described above on an after-tax basis consistent with the presentation of non-GAAP net income. Non-GAAP net income is presented using a non-GAAP tax rate. The Company’s non-GAAP tax rate represents a recalculation of the GAAP tax rate reflecting the exclusion of the non-GAAP items.\nCree expects to incur many of these same expenses, including income taxes associated with these expenses, in future periods. In addition to the non-GAAP measures discussed above, Cree also uses free cash flow as a measure of operating performance and liquidity. Free cash flow represents operating cash flows less net purchases of property and equipment and patent and licensing rights. Cree considers free cash flow to be an operating performance and a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the purchases of property and equipment, a portion of which can then be used to, among other things, invest in Cree’s business, make strategic acquisitions, strengthen the balance sheet and repurchase stock. A limitation of the utility of free cash flow as a measure of operating performance and liquidity is that it does not represent the residual cash flow available to the company for discretionary expenditures, as it excludes certain mandatory expenditures such as debt service.\nCREE, INC.\nUnaudited Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Measures\n(in thousands, except per share amounts and percentages)\nNon-GAAP Gross Margin\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 25,\n2018\nMarch 26,\n2017\nMarch 25,\n2018\nMarch 26,\n2017\nGAAP gross profit $99,056 $86,076 $291,991 $336,574 GAAP gross margin percentage 27.8 % 25.2 % 26.9 % 30.2 % Adjustment: Stock-based compensation expense 1,729 2,229 5,402 8,012 Transaction costs related to the acquisition of RF Power 128 — 128 — Total adjustments to GAAP gross profit $1,857 $2,229 $5,530 $8,012 Non-GAAP gross profit $100,913 $88,305 $297,521 $344,586 Non-GAAP gross margin percentage 28.3 % 25.9 % 27.4 % 30.9 % Non-GAAP Operating Income (Loss)\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 25,\n2018\nMarch 26,\n2017\nMarch 25,\n2018\nMarch 26,\n2017\nGAAP operating loss ($268,063 ) ($19,902 ) ($308,474 ) ($5,602 ) GAAP operating loss (75.3 )% (5.8 )% (28.5 )% (0.5 )% Adjustments: Stock-based compensation expense: Cost of revenue, net 1,729 2,229 5,402 8,012 Research and development 2,374 2,542 6,830 8,468 Sales, general and administrative 7,056 6,790 21,087 21,937 Total stock-based compensation expense 11,159 11,561 33,319 38,417 Amortization or impairment of acquisition-related intangibles 7,453 8,362 21,037 20,707 LED business restructuring charges — (5 ) — 15 Goodwill impairment charges 247,455 — 247,455 — Transaction costs related to the acquisition of RF Power 4,327 — 4,327 — Transaction costs related to the terminated sale of the Wolfspeed business — 6,854 — 11,826 Wolfspeed transaction termination fee — (12,500 ) — (12,500 ) Executive Severance 1,343 — 6,223 — Total adjustments to GAAP operating loss 271,737 14,272 312,361 58,465 Non-GAAP operating income (loss) $3,674 ($5,630 ) $3,887 $52,863 Non-GAAP operating income (loss) 1.0 % (1.6 )% 0.4 % 4.7 % Non-GAAP Non-Operating Income, net\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 25,\n2018\nMarch 26,\n2017\nMarch 25,\n2018\nMarch 26,\n2017\nGAAP non-operating (expense) income, net ($9,651 ) $9,865 $16,011 $4,946 Adjustment: Net changes associated with equity method investment 12,096 (8,445 ) (10,055 ) (2,596 ) Foreign exchange gain on RF Power acquisition (1,941 ) — (1,941 ) — Non-GAAP non-operating income, net $504 $1,420 $4,015 $2,350 Non-GAAP Net Income\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 25,\n2018\nMarch 26,\n2017\nMarch 25,\n2018\nMarch 26,\n2017\nGAAP net loss ($240,577 ) ($99,013 ) ($246,712 ) ($92,230 ) Adjustments: Stock-based compensation expense 11,159 11,561 33,319 38,417 Amortization or impairment of acquisition-related intangibles 7,453 8,362 21,037 20,707 LED business restructuring charges — (5 ) — 15 Goodwill impairment charges 247,455 — 247,455 — Transaction costs related to the RF Power acquisition 4,327 — 4,327 — Transaction costs related to the terminated sale of the Wolfspeed business — 6,854 — 11,826 Wolfspeed transaction termination fee — (12,500 ) — (12,500 ) Executive Severance 1,343 — 6,223 — Net changes associated with equity method investment 12,096 (8,445 ) (10,055 ) (2,596 ) Foreign exchange gain on RF Power acquisition (1,941 ) — (1,941 ) — Total adjustments to GAAP net loss before provision for income taxes 281,892 5,827 300,365 55,869 Income tax effect (37,474 ) 93,935 (46,363 ) 82,188 Non-GAAP net income $3,841 $749 $7,290 $45,827 Non-GAAP Earnings per share Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share $0.04 $0.01 $0.07 $0.46 Shares used in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share calculation Non-GAAP shares used 100,140 97,346 99,046 98,791 Free Cash Flow\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended March 25,\n2018\nMarch 26,\n2017\nMarch 25,\n2018\nMarch 26,\n2017\nCash flows from operations $19,609 $43,440 $125,423 $163,154 Less: PP&E spending (43,211 ) (21,684 ) (128,433 ) (56,895 ) Less: Patents spending (2,981 ) (3,040 ) (7,913 ) (8,876 ) Total free cash flow ($26,583 ) $18,716 ($10,923 ) $97,383 CREE, INC.\nBusiness Outlook Unaudited GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliation\n(in millions)\nThree Months Ended June 24, 2018 GAAP net loss outlook range ($34) to ($38) Adjustments: Stock-based compensation expense 11 Amortization or impairment of acquired intangibles 10 Amortization of Infineon RF Power Inventory basis step-up 5 Infineon RF Power transition and integration costs 5 Lighting Products restructuring costs 7 Total adjustments to GAAP net loss before provision for income taxes 38 Income tax effect 5 Non-GAAP net income outlook range $5 to $9\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180424006518/en/\nCree, Inc.\nRaiford Garrabrant, 919-407-7895\nDirector, Investor Relations\ninvestorrelations@cree.com\nSource: Cree, Inc.",
