He notes Zuckerberg bought lots and houses around his home to ensure his privacy.\nWozniak says he closed his Facebook account after several trusted friends deleted their accounts last week amid the company's data privacy scandal.\nFacebook has announced technical changes intended to address privacy issues.\n7:20 a.m.\nApple co-founder Steve Wozniak is shutting down his Facebook account as the social media giant struggles to cope with the worst privacy crisis in its history.\nIn an email to USA Today, Wozniak says Facebook makes a lot of advertising money from personal details provided by users. He says the \"profits are all based on the user's info, but the users get none of the profits back.\"\nWozniak says he'd rather pay for Facebook. He says \"Apple makes money off of good products, not off of you.\"\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will testify on Capitol Hill on Tuesday and Wednesday about the company's ongoing data-privacy scandal and how it failed to guard against other abuses of its service.\nFacebook has announced technical changes intended to address privacy issues.",
