    "text": "April 12 (Reuters) - U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines Inc reported a 9.5 percent rise in quarterly revenue on Thursday, boosted by higher average fares and passenger traffic.\nHowever, the company’s net income fell to $547 million in the first quarter ended March 31, from $561 million a year earlier.\nThe No. 2 U.S. airline by passenger traffic’s earnings per share remained flat at 77 cents.\nTotal operating revenue for the first quarter rose to $9.97 billion from $9.10 billion and the carrier forecast total unit revenue - a key metric which compares sales with flight capacity - to increase 3 percent to 5 percent in the second quarter.
