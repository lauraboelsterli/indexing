    "text": "SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian food processor BRF SA said it has received no communication regarding the resignation of Abilio Diniz as chairman of the company, according to a securities filing late on Thursday.\nBRF Brasil Foods new chairman Abilio Diniz listens to a reporter's question during a news conference in Sao Paulo April 10, 2013. REUTERS/Nacho Doce/File Photo In a letter sent to BRF by Diniz, the businessman told the company that he was still in talks with certain shareholders aimed at negotiating names for the election of new members to the board, the filing said.\nDiniz told BRF no agreement had been made with the concerned shareholders until 5:30 p.m. on Thursday, adding it is thus premature to disclose any information to the market, the filing said.\nPetros and Previ, the pension funds which hold a combined 22 percent stake in BRF, are pushing for the dissolution of BRFâ€™s board after the company posted its worst-ever annual result in 2017.\nIn official communications with BRF, Petros and Previ said they continue to support a list of new board members unveiled on Feb. 24.\nAn extraordinary board meeting is scheduled for April 26 to elect a new board.\nReporting by Ana Mano\n ",
