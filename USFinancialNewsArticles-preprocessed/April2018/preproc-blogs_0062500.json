    "text": "31 Mins Ago | 02:24\nIf you search the web for rare Apple prototypes, you'll likely come across the name Hap Plain.\nPlain is a private collector in California, with what he describes as the world's largest collection of rare Apple prototypes by a private collector.\nOver the last decade, he's amassed a collection of more than 250 unreleased Apple products, like iPhones, iPods, laptops, desktops, servers â€” and the list goes on.\nPlain even turned his collection into profit by selling the items on eBay . In March, Plain listed a rare Lisa 2 prototype on eBay for just under $100,000; however, it caught the attention of Apple's lawyers and has since been removed.\nBut Plain will continue adding to his collection and hopes some of the devices end up in a museum one day.",
