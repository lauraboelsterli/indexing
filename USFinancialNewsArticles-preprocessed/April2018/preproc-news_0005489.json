    "text": "April 3, 2018 / 10:51 PM / Updated 14 hours ago 'Wonder Woman' Lynda Carter feted with Hollywood star Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \nLOS ANGELES (Reuters) - With her arms crossed and poised for action, “Wonder Woman” television actress Lynda Carter was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Tuesday as her most famous superhero character enjoys a big-screen revival. \nCarter, 66, was introduced by longtime friend and CBS Corp Chief Executive Leslie Moonves and Patty Jenkins, the director of last year’s blockbuster film “Wonder Woman.” \n“It seems impossible but I have been in entertainment for more than 50 years — do the math,” Carter told the audience along Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles before the unveiling of the emblematic terrazzo and brass star. \n“I have loved it all!” the former Miss World USA exclaimed. \nCarter’s “Wonder Woman” character, which first appeared on the pages of DC Comics in 1941 and debuted as a TV series starring the actress in 1976, is seen as a forerunner to the empowered heroines that are taking center stage in Hollywood. \nJenkins, 46, said Carter inspired her as a girl and showed her that she did not have to choose between being rebellious or feminine, or attractive or strong.

But the series, along with Carter’s performance, have given “Wonder Woman” a long legacy as a feminist symbol. \nAt times choking with emotion, Carter thanked her friends and family for their support as well as a nod to the men who helped stand behind women’s stories. \n“From all of the wonder women out there, we love our men who stand with us and champion our causes and our voices,” Carter said.
