REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne/File Photo \nThe Investec Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) slowed to 54.1 in March from 56.2 in February after Storm Emma forced businesses to use buffer stocks to help meet demand, the survey’s authors said. \n“Anecdotal evidence overwhelmingly linked the slowdown in output growth to snow disruption caused by Storm Emma,” the authors said in a statement. \nBut the sector remained above the 50 mark separating growth from contraction for the 58th consecutive month as new orders and employment continued to grow sharply. \nThe future output index of expectations was little changed, with around 11 times as many manufacturers anticipating growth over the coming 12 months as those who foresee a decline, the survey showed. \n“We wouldn’t read too much into this month’s data given the weather distortions and would expect a marked improvement when the April Manufacturing PMI report is released,” Investec Ireland chief economist Philip O’Sullivan said. \n- Detailed PMI data are only available under licence from IHS Markit and customers need to apply for a licence. \nTo subscribe to the full data, click on the link below: here Reporting by Conor Humphries; Editing by Catherine Evans",
