    "text": "SYRACUSE, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Community Bank System, Inc. (NYSE: CBU) reported record first quarter 2018 net income of $40.1 million, or $0.78 per fully diluted share, compared with $26.3 million, or $0.57 per share reported for the first quarter of 2017. First quarter 2017’s results included $1.7 million, or $0.03 per share of acquisition expenses. Excluding acquisition expenses and the one-time tax benefit from the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017, the linked fourth quarter of 2017’s earnings per share were $0.67 per share.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Performance Highlights:\nFirst quarter EPS of $0.78, up 37% over the first quarter of 2017.\nNoninterest income was up 30% over the first quarter of 2017, representing 40% of operating revenues.\nDeposit funding costs of 0.10%. Beta remains at zero.\nReturn on assets of 1.52%.\nReturn on tangible equity of 19%.\n“We’re very pleased with this quarter’s results and the continuation of our earnings acceleration, due principally to the strategic deployment of capital last year with the NRS and Merchants Bancshares transactions,” said President and Chief Executive Officer Mark E. Tryniski. “In addition, our fee-based businesses continue to grow both revenue and margin, contributing significantly to earnings and cash flow. EPS growth of 30% over last year, excluding acquisition expenses, was also supported by a lower effective tax rate that contributed approximately one-fifth of that improvement. We are very well positioned for the remainder of the year.”\nTotal revenues for the first quarter of 2018 were $142.1 million, an increase of $30.5 million, or 27.4%, over the prior year quarter, and included the results from both the Merchants and NRS transactions completed in the first half of last year. Higher revenues were generated as a result of a 21.5% increase in average earning assets and continued growth in noninterest income, as well as a six basis-point increase in the net interest margin from the prior year quarter. A combination of acquired and organic growth resulted in an $8.6 million, or 30.3% increase in wealth management, insurance, and employee benefit services revenues compared to the prior year quarter. Deposit service fees increased 30.4% year-over-year, primarily the result of the addition of Merchants, as well as increased debit card-related revenues. Other banking services were up marginally, year-over-year. The quarterly provision for loan losses of $3.7 million was $1.9 million higher than the first quarter of 2017, reflective of higher quarterly net charge-off levels, including an incremental $1.1 million partial charge-off related to a single commercial relationship that incurred a $3.1 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-performing asset and delinquent loan ratios were up slightly in comparison to the end of the first quarter of 2017, and included the impact of the previously mentioned commercial relationship which also adds over $4.1 million to non-performing assets. Total operating expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $86.3 million. This compares to $71.9 million (excluding acquisition expenses) in the first quarter of 2017. Included in the first quarter 2018 results are the operating expenses from Merchants and NRS, as well as an additional $2.0 million of intangible amortization, primarily a result of those two transactions.\nFirst quarter 2018 net interest income was $84.6 million, an increase of $17.3 million, or 25.8%, compared to the first quarter of 2017, and included the impact of the Merchants acquisition. In comparison to first quarter 2017, funding costs increased two basis points, and earning asset yields increased seven basis points, resulting in a six basis-point improvement in the net interest margin. The increase in the earning asset yield was driven by an incremental $1.6 million in non-impaired purchased loan accretion, as well as $0.8 million of accretion on a purchased impaired relationship. On a year-over-year basis, average loan balances grew $1.3 billion, or 26.3%, principally related to the Merchants transaction, while average loan yields increased 22 basis points, including the incremental purchased loan accretion. Investment interest income was $1.4 million higher than the first quarter of 2017, as average investment securities balances (including cash equivalents) increased by $358.7 million, due to the portfolio acquired from Merchants, while the yield on investments declined 30 basis points. Interest expense was $1.1 million higher than the previous year’s first quarter, driven by a $275.5 million increase in average borrowings (primarily customer repurchase agreements) and a $1.32 billion increase in average deposit balances, principally related to the Merchants transaction, and a net two basis point increase in the overall cost of funds.\nWealth management and insurance services revenues increased to $14.1 million, an increase of $2.8 million, or 24.9%, compared to the first quarter of 2017, driven by both acquired and organic growth. Employee benefit services revenues of $23.0 million, increased $5.8 million from the first quarter of 2017 and were primarily attributable to the NRS acquisition.\nExcluding acquisition expenses, first quarter 2018 operating expenses of $86.3 million, which included a full quarter of operating activities from both Merchants and NRS, increased $14.5 million over the first quarter of 2017. Salaries and employee benefits increased $9.0 million, or 20.9%, and included the personnel added from the two transactions, as well as annual merit and performance-based increases. All other operating expenses increased 19.1% year-over-year, and reflected the occupancy, equipment and other operating costs of both Merchants and NRS, including significantly higher intangible asset amortization, compared to the first quarter of 2017.\nThe effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2018 was 23.0%, down from 27.4% in the first quarter of last year benefitting earnings by $0.04 per share, and reflected the lower federal tax rate that resulted from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act passed in the fourth quarter of 2017. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company adopted new accounting guidance for share-based transactions. That guidance requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies associated with share-based compensation be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. Previously, tax effects resulting from changes in the Company’s share price subsequent to the grant date of equity instruments were recorded through shareholders’ equity at the time of vesting or exercise. The adoption of the amended accounting guidance resulted in a $2.2 million reduction of income tax expense in the first quarter of 2017, or $0.04 of diluted earnings per common share, and a $0.3 million reduction of income tax expense in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2017, or less than $0.01 per share each quarter. In the first quarter of 2018, the new guidance resulted in a $0.7 million reduction of income tax expense, or $0.01 per share.\nThe Company also provides supplemental reporting of its results on a “net adjusted” or “tangible” basis, from which it excludes the after-tax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets (and the related goodwill, core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances, net of applicable deferred tax amounts), accretion on non-impaired purchased loans, expenses associated with acquisitions, and the one-time benefit from the revaluation of net deferred tax liabilities. The amounts for such items are presented in the tables that accompany this release. Although “adjusted net income” as defined by the Company is a non-GAAP measure, the Company’s management believes this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in its reported results. Adjusted net earnings per share were $0.82 in the first quarter of 2018, compared to $0.63 in the first quarter of 2017, or a 30.2% increase.\nFinancial Position\nAverage earning assets of $9.38 billion for the first quarter of 2018 were up modestly from the fourth quarter of 2017. Average deposit balances were down slightly from fourth quarter levels, but ending deposits were seasonally up $326.7 million, or 3.9%. Average borrowings (including customer repurchase agreements) in the first quarter of 2018 of $453.1 million, were also consistent with fourth quarter 2017 levels.\nEnding loans at March 31, 2018 declined $29.7 million from year-end 2017, principally attributable to lower residential real estate balances, consistent with expectations. Investment securities totaled $3.03 billion at March 31, 2018, down slightly from the end of the fourth quarter, and up from the end of the first quarter of 2017 due to investments added from Merchants, and partially offset by limited reinvestment of securities cash flows over the last several quarters.\nShareholders’ equity of $1.63 billion at first quarter-end was $335.4 million, or 25.9%, higher than the prior year period, a result of strong earnings generation and capital retention over the last four quarters, as well as incremental shares issued in conjunction with the Merchants acquisition. The Company’s net tangible equity to net tangible assets ratio was 8.42% at March 31, 2018, down from 8.91% a year earlier, primarily a result of the Merchants acquisitions completed in the second quarter of 2017. The Company’s Tier 1 leverage ratio was 10.19% at the end of the first quarter, down marginally from 10.35% a year earlier due mostly to the impact of the Merchants transaction.\nAs previously announced in December 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to 2.5 million shares of the Company’s common stock during a twelve-month period starting January 1, 2018. Such repurchases may be made at the discretion of the Company’s senior management based on market conditions and other relevant factors and will be acquired through open market or privately negotiated transactions as permitted under Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and other applicable legal requirements. There were no shares repurchased in the first quarter of 2018.\nAsset Quality\nDespite the previously mentioned partial charge-off of $4.2 million on a specific acquired commercial relationship in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, the Company’s asset quality metrics continue to illustrate the long-term effectiveness of the Company’s disciplined risk management and underwriting standards. Total net charge-offs were $3.2 million for the first quarter, compared to $2.0 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $5.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. Net charge-offs as an annualized percentage of average loans measured 0.21% in the first quarter of 2018, compared to 0.16% in the prior year’s first quarter and 0.37% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans at March 31, 2018 were 0.48%, compared to 0.44% at December 31, 2017 and 0.46% at March 31, 2017. The total loan delinquency ratio of 1.01% at the end of the first quarter was nine basis points lower than the level at December 31, 2017, and seven basis points higher than last year’s first quarter-end. The first quarter provision for loan losses of $3.7 million was $1.9 million higher than the first quarter of 2017, and $1.7 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2017. The allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was 162% at March 31, 2018, compared with 173% and 206% at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 and first quarter of 2017, respectively.\nDividend Increase\nDuring the first quarter of 2018 the Company declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.34 per share on its common stock, compared to a $0.32 dividend declared in the first quarter of 2017, or 6.3% higher, which represents an annualized yield of 2.5% based upon the $54.61 closing price of the Company’s stock on April 23, 2018. The two cent increase declared in the third quarter of 2017 marked the 25 th consecutive year of dividend increases for the Company. “The acceleration of our earnings and cash flow results will provide further strength to capital accumulation and dividend capacity into the future,” said Mark E. Tryniski, President and Chief Executive Officer.\nMerchants Bancshares, Inc.\nThe Company completed the acquisition of Merchants Bancshares, Inc. (\"Merchants\"), parent company of Merchants Bank headquartered in South Burlington, Vermont, on May 12, 2017, for $345.2 million in Company stock and cash. The transaction extended the Company's footprint into the Vermont and Western Massachusetts markets. The transaction added 31 branch locations in Vermont and one office in Western Massachusetts in addition to approximately $2.0 billion of assets and $1.5 billion in deposits.\nNortheast Retirement Services, Inc.\nThe Company acquired Northeast Retirement Services, Inc. (“NRS”), a leading provider of plan accounting, transfer agency, fund administration, trust and retirement plan services for $148.6 million in Company stock and cash on February 3, 2017.\nConference Call Scheduled\nCompany management will conduct an investor call at 11:00 a.m. (ET) tomorrow, April 25, 2018, to discuss first quarter 2018 results.
