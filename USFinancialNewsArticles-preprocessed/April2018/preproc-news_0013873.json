    "text": "April 6, 2018 \nBillionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk— an outspoken artificial intelligence doubter — is again sounding warning bells about AI. \nMusk took to Twitter early Friday morning to tease a new documentary by filmmaker Chris Paine, in which he appears. The film, called Do You Trust This Computer? , takes a hard look at artificial intelligence and so-called super-intelligence, or a form of AI even smarter than humans. \nIn the movie, Musk says anyone who develops “godlike digital super-intelligence” could “take over the world” and become “an immortal dictator from which we can never escape.” \n“Nothing will affect the future of humanity more than digital super-intelligence,” he added on Twitter. Nothing will affect the future of humanity more than digital super-intelligence. Watch Chris Paine’s new AI movie for free until Sunday night at https://t.co/WehHcZX7Qe \nDespite the fact that Tesla, the car company that Musk helms, is experimenting with AI , he has called the technology “the greatest risk we face as a civilization” due to the dangers of its possible misuse . \nDuring his latest Twitter thread, Musk’s criticism got literary, as he drew an opaque comparison between AI and Dr. Frankenstein’s monster. “You are my creator, but I am your master” — Mary Shelley \n— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 6, 2018 SPONSORED FINANCIAL CONTENT ",
