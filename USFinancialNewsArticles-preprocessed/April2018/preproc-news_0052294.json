    "text": "Walgreens Boots Alliance : \"We think Amazon is not going to go [into the pharmaceutical business] and we think Walgreens is way too beat up, so I say it's time to buy [Walgreens' stock].\"\nArena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. : \"We like these special pharmacy [companies]. â€¦ This is a good one, too, and so I think you've got a nice spec.\"\nDominion : \"You know, I've got to tell you, you have to buy it. I know it's painful and a lot of people feel like it's got this midstream operation that they're worried about. I say it's time to think longer term. It's a good company.\"\nTower Semiconductor : \"Look, Tower's good, but I've got to tell you, I've got Intel and I've got AMD . Why do I have to mess with Tower Semi?\"\nWestern Union : \"Doesn't get any respect and it's just too hard to own. There's so many other stocks that are flying. I'm going to have to say no.\"\nIdexx Laboratories : \"The humanization of pets story remains a bull story and I say buy, buy, buy.\"\nHuntington Ingalls Industries : \"I want you to take some profits. All of the defense stocks are going lower. Now, will that selling die down? Yes, it will. But right now, we've got to take some profits.\"\nGlaxoSmithKline : \"You know, I like it. I know a lot of people turned on it the other day. It's back up. I think this new person, [CEO] Emma Walmsley, who runs the company, is doing a fantastic job. It's got a nice yield. GSK is for me.\"\nLexinFintech Holdings : \"No. The only ones from China that I'm recommending are Baidu and Alibaba and Baozun and that's it. I'm being tight on the rest and not putting many of those Chinese stocks on. Don't like how they act.\"\nWatch the full lightning round here: show chapters Cramer's lightning round: Now is the time to buy Walgreens' stock 21 Hours Ago | 04:05 Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Amazon.\n ",
