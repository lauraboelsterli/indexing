    "text": "April 4 (Reuters) - The Ohio Department of Insurance said on Wednesday that pharmacy benefit managers and insurers would have to disclose the most affordable prescription drug options for Ohio consumers.\nThe agency said in a bulletin that it would disallow the practice of certain insurers and pharmacy benefit managers that use contractual provisions to prevent pharmacists from discussing with consumers if low-cost options are available for prescriptions.\nIt would also prohibit them from charging customers a higher amount for prescription drugs than what it would otherwise cost without insurance coverage.\nThe agency said the provisions in the bulletin would take effect immediately.
