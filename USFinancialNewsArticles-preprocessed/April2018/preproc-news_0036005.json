    "text": "When Barbara Pierce married a dashing World War II pilot who had painted her name on his plane, she likely had no idea the kind of history they would make together. Mrs. George H.W. Bush would stay devoted by his side until Tuesday, when she died of complications from lung and heart disease at age 92.\nSeventy-three years of marriage is itself an achievement few could match. Mrs. Bush said she would tell her children she married the first man she ever kissed, and never looked back. It wasnâ€™t without her share of heartache.... RELATED VIDEO Former first lady Barbara Bush has died at the age of 92. She was the wife of 41st president George H.W. Bush, mother of 43rd president, George W. Bush, and 2016 candidate Jeb Bush. During and after her time in the White House she championed the cause of improving literacy rates among Americans. Photo: Reuters ",
