REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage \nChina on Sunday announced tariffs on $3 billion in imports of U.S. food and other goods in response to U.S. tariffs on imports of aluminum and steel, a skirmish that investors fear is a prelude to a broader trade war. \n“China does not provoke a trade war, and doesn’t want to fight a trade war, but we also aren’t afraid of a trade war,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a regular news briefing. \nThe Section 301 investigation initiated by U.S. President Donald Trump is focused on accusations of theft of intellectual property and forced technology transfer by China, charges Beijing denies.
