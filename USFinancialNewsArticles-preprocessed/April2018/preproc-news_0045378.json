Based on data collected to date, Leucrotta believes higher intensity fracs will recover incremental reserves over that of previously drilled wells with lower frac intensity and have better economic returns despite higher capital. The next three step-out/delineation wells will be completed with higher intensity fracs to further prove this thesis.\nFrom geological and other data collected, Leucrotta believes there is an oil resource in multiple zones through-out its land base. Leucrotta has drilled an Upper Montney well that it will evaluate during 2018 to potentially prove the presence of oil and commerciality of this zone. Other Montney zones above and below the Lower Montney will also be cored and evaluated for oil potential. If warranted, Leucrotta would complete existing vertical wells to gather additional data on these other potential Montney zones.\nLeucrotta has continued to build out the infrastructure and tie-in previously tested wells. Production has continued to increase and operating costs have continued to decline. Although the primary driver of the business plan is to delineate and evaluate the Montney, the production and related cash flow are providing meaningful capital for reinvesting.\nFor 2018, Leucrotta plans to spend approximately $33.0 million primarily on the delineation of the Lower Montney and related infrastructure. At the end of 2017, Leucrotta had approximately $18.7 million of positive working capital, no debt, and a $20.0 million undrawn bank credit facility. Leucrotta expects to be debt-free throughout 2018 based on its opening cash balance plus projected cash flow of $15.0 million on estimated production of 3,600 boe/d.\nWe look forward to reporting on the results of the new wells and other business developments in the near future.\nFREQUENTLY RECURRING TERMS\nThe Company uses the following frequently recurring industry terms in this news release: “bbls” refers to barrels, “mcf” refers to thousand cubic feet, and “boe” refers to barrel of oil equivalent. Disclosure provided herein in respect of a boe may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion rate of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil equivalent has been used for the calculation of boe amounts in this news release. This boe conversion rate is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.\nNON-GAAP MEASURES\nThis news release refers to certain financial measures that are not determined in accordance with IFRS (or “GAAP”). This news release contains the terms “adjusted funds flow”, “adjusted funds flow per share”, and “operating netback” which do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. The Company uses these measures to help evaluate its performance.\nManagement uses adjusted funds flow to analyze performance and considers it a key measure as it demonstrates the Company’s ability to generate the cash necessary to fund future capital investments and to repay debt, if any. Adjusted funds flow is a non-GAAP measure and has been defined by the Company as cash flow from (used in) operating activities excluding the change in non-cash working capital related to operating activities and expenditures on decommissioning obligations. The Company also presents adjusted funds flow per share whereby amounts per share are calculated using weighted average shares outstanding, consistent with the calculation of net loss per share. Adjusted funds flow is reconciled from cash flow from (used in) operating activities under the heading “Adjusted Funds Flow” in the Company’s MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2017, which is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com .\nManagement considers operating netback an important measure as it demonstrates its profitability relative to current commodity prices. Operating netback, which is calculated as average unit sales price less royalties, production expenses, and transportation expenses, represents the cash margin for every barrel of oil equivalent sold. Operating netback per boe is reconciled to net income (loss) per boe under the heading “Operating Netback”.\nFORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION ﻿\nThis news release contains and forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws. The use of any of the words “expect”, “anticipate”, “continue”, “estimate”, “may”, “will”, “should”, “believe”, “intends”, “forecast”, “plans”, “guidance” and similar expressions are intended to identify or information.\nMore particularly and without limitation, this news release contains and information relating to the Company’s oil, NGLs, and natural gas production, capital programs, cash flow and working capital. The and information are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by the Company, including expectations and assumptions relating to prevailing commodity prices and exchange rates, applicable royalty rates and tax laws, future well production rates, the performance of existing wells, the success of drilling new wells, the availability of capital to undertake planned activities, and the availability and cost of labour and services.\nAlthough the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such and information are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Since and information address future events and conditions, by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results may currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks. These include, but are not limited to, the risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general such as operational risks in development, exploration and production, delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures, the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to production rates, costs, and expenses, commodity price and exchange rate fluctuations, marketing and transportation, environmental risks, competition, the ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources and changes in tax, royalty, and environmental legislation. The and information contained in this document are made as of the date hereof for the purpose of providing the readers with the Company’s expectations for the coming year. The and information may not be appropriate for other purposes. The Company undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any or information, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless so required by applicable securities laws.\nLeucrotta is an oil and natural gas company, actively engaged in the acquisition, development, exploration, and production of oil and natural gas reserves in northeastern British Columbia, Canada.\nFurther Information\nFor additional information, please contact:\nMr. Robert J.
