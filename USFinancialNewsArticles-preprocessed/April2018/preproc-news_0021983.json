(NASDAQ: BBBY) today reported financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter (14 weeks) and full year (53 weeks) ended March 3, 2018.\nFiscal 2017 Fourth Quarter Results\nFor the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter (14 weeks), the Company reported net earnings of $1.41 per diluted share ($194.0 million), which included a net unfavorable $10.5 million tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act).

Net earnings for the fiscal 2016 fourth quarter (13 weeks) were $1.84 per diluted share ($268.7 million).\nNet sales for the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter (14 weeks) were approximately $3.7 billion, an increase of approximately 5.2% from the prior year quarter (13 weeks). Comparable sales in the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter (14 weeks) decreased by approximately 0.6%, and included strong sales growth from the Company's customer-facing digital channels, and sales from stores that declined in the mid-single-digit percentage range.\nFiscal 2017 Full Year Results\nFor the fiscal full year (53 weeks), the Company reported net earnings of $3.04 per diluted share ($424.9 million), which included a net unfavorable $10.5 million tax expense related to the Tax Act, compared with $4.58 per diluted share ($685.1 million) in the corresponding period a year ago (52 weeks). Excluding the net unfavorable impact from the Tax Act, net earnings per diluted share in fiscal 2017 would have been $3.12.\nNet sales for fiscal 2017 (53 weeks) were approximately $12.3 billion, an increase of approximately 1.1% compared with fiscal 2016 (52 weeks). Comparable sales for the fiscal 2017 full year (53 weeks) decreased by approximately 1.3%, and included strong sales growth from the Company's customer-facing digital channels, and sales from stores that declined in the mid-single-digit percentage range.\nCapital Allocation\nAs a reflection of the long-term health of the business, and commitment to creating shareholder value, the Company's Board of Directors today declared an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.16 per share. The increased quarterly dividend is payable on July 17, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 15, 2018.\nDuring the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter, the Company repurchased approximately $45 million of its common stock, representing approximately 2 million shares, under its existing $2.5 billion share repurchase program.
