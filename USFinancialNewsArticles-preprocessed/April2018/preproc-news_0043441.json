    "text": "JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Iran and Israel traded blame on Sunday for an unprecedented, weeks-long surge in hostilities between their forces over Syria but played down prospects of a spillover into war.\nFILE PHOTO: Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif attends a meeting with Belgian counterpart Didier Reynders (unseen) at the Egmont Palace in Brussels, Belgium January 11, 2018. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir/File photo A showdown between the arch-foes has loomed since Feb. 10, when Israel said an armed Iranian drone launched from a Syrian base penetrated its territory. Israel downed the drone and, during a reprisal raid, lost an F-16 jet to Syrian ground fire.\nOn April 9, an air strike killed seven Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps members at the Syrian base. Tehran blamed Israel and vowed unspecified retaliation, drawing Israeli counter-threats to broaden attacks on Iranian military assets in Syria.\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a U.S. television interview that further Israeli sorties in Syria would have “consequences”. But he deemed major escalation as unlikely.\n“I do not believe that we are headed towards regional war but I do believe that unfortunately, Israel has continued its violations with international law, hoping to be able to do it with impunity because of the U.S. support and trying to find smokescreens to hide behind,” Zarif told CBS News.\n“The easiest answer would be to stop - to stop these acts of aggression, to stop these incursions.”\nFILE PHOTO: Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman chairs the Yisrael Beitenu faction weekly meeting at the Knesset, the Israeli Parliament, in Jerusalem, March 12, 2018. REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun/File photo Iran, Lebanon’s Hezbollah militia and Russia have been reinforcing Damascus against a 7-year-old Syrian rebellion. The Israelis worry that Iran’s garrison will remain, linking with Hezbollah to form a broad Syrian-Lebanese front against them.\nIsraeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman reiterated his government’s policy of preventing Iranian entrenchment in Syria.\n“No matter the price, we will not allow a noose to form around us,” he told Israel Radio in an interview.\nFILE PHOTO: Israel's Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz arrives at the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem September 4, 2016. REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun/File photo DETERRENCE But asked if that meant war was imminent, he said: “I hope not. I think that our primary role is prevent war, and that requires concrete, real deterrence as well as readiness to act.”\nIsrael Katz, the Israeli intelligence minister, suggested world powers might intervene to curb Iranian activity in Syria.\nIsrael is “not interested” in escalation, Katz told the Ynet news site. But Israeli power-projection, he said, “can challenge the Iranians, can clarify to the Russians, who seek stability, that it is worth it for them to apply their influence, and the same goes for the United States, for France and all the others”.\nThe Syria face-off comes as the Trump administration mulls reimposing U.S. economic sanctions against Tehran by May 12, a move that could deal a blow to an international 2015 deal under which the Iranians capped their nuclear projects.\nZarif said Iran might respond to any unraveling of the deal by “resuming at a much greater speed our nuclear activities”.\nIsrael has savaged the deal and encouraged a U.S. review, but Katz appeared to acknowledge the outcome could be costly.\n“The United States is changing policy. Israel is determined to prevent this (Iranian nuclear) red-line, a crossing of this red-line,” he said. “These are testing times for us. I hope that we won’t pay prices.”\nWriting by Dan Williams, Editing by William Maclean\n ",
