    "text": "Pinterest \nOhanian, who never watched tennis before meeting Williams in 2015, says he’s had a “front-row seat over the last three years to greatness. It’s a humbling experience seeing really what high-pressure situations actually look like professionally, seeing just what it takes to actually be that great. It is a work ethic on another level.” \nWilliams, a 23-time Grand Slam champion who won the 2017 Australian Open while pregnant, discussed her desire to be the best version of herself with Glamour in an interview last year: “I try to be the best that I can be every day. I have bad days. I had a bad day the other day. I hit for only, like, 30 minutes, and I stormed off the court. But that was the best I could do on that day.” \nOhanian says watching Williams compete has changed how he measures success in business. \nHe tells the Times: “One thing that I have always respected in sport is it is so pure in its success metrics. In business, we can find creative ways to measure ourselves: ‘Yes, well, one fund has been more successful than another because they’ve invested in six unicorns.’ \n“But in sport, there’s a winner and a loser, and you can’t delude yourself into thinking there’s some other way to compare or measure. You’re the best or you’re not.” \nLike this story? Like CNBC Make It on Facebook! \nDon’t miss: Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian asks young people, ‘Do you really need to go to college?’ ",
