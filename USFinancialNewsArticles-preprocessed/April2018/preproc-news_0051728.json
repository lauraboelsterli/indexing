    "text": "BEDFORD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Aspen Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ: AZPN), the asset optimization software company, today announced financial results for its third quarter of fiscal year 2018, ended March 31, 2018.\n“AspenTech’s third quarter reflected good execution across the company and a solid demand environment, resulting in strong financial results. The quarter was highlighted by strong performance among our owner-operator customers and continued momentum of our APM suite. We are also pleased with growing customer interest in our APM products across a number of geographies and industries,” said Antonio Pietri, President and Chief Executive Officer of AspenTech.\nThird Quarter Fiscal 2018 and Recent Business Highlights\nAnnual spend, which the company defines as the annualized value of all term license and maintenance contracts at the end of the quarter, was approximately $480 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2018, which increased 6.3% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017 and 2.3% sequentially. GAAP operating margin was 40.6%, compared to 43.8% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP operating margin was 45.6%, compared to 48.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. AspenTech repurchased approximately 650,000 shares of its common stock for $50.0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.\nSummary of Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Financial Results\nAspenTech’s total revenue of $125.9 million included:\nSubscription and software revenue was $118.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase from $111.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Services and other revenue was $7.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $7.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.\nFor the quarter ended March 31, 2018, AspenTech reported income from operations of $51.2 million, compared to income from operations of $52.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nNet income was $37.8 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, leading to net income per share of $0.52, compared to net income per share of $0.47 in the same period last fiscal year.\nNon-GAAP income from operations, which adds back the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions and acquisition related fees, was $57.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to non-GAAP income from operations of $57.4 million in the same period last fiscal year. Non-GAAP net income was $42.3 million, or $0.58 per share, for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to non-GAAP net income of $39.4 million, or $0.52 per share, in the same period last fiscal year. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is presented in the financial tables included in this press release.\nAspenTech had cash and marketable securities of $71.1 million and borrowings of $170.0 million at March 31, 2018.\nDuring the third quarter, the company generated $73.1 million in cash flow from operations and $78.1 million in free cash flow. Free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for the net impact of: purchases of property, equipment and leasehold improvements; capitalized computer software development costs; non-capitalized acquired technology, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and other nonrecurring items, such as acquisition or litigation related payments.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis press release contains “non-GAAP financial measures” under the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Non-GAAP financial measures are not based on a comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. This non-GAAP information supplements, and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with, disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in the financial tables included in this press release.\nManagement considers both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results in managing AspenTech’s business. As the result of adoption of new licensing models, management believes that a number of AspenTech’s performance indicators based on GAAP, including revenue, gross profit, operating income and net income, should be viewed in conjunction with certain non-GAAP and other business measures in assessing AspenTech’s performance, growth and financial condition. Accordingly, management utilizes a number of non-GAAP and other business metrics, including the non-GAAP metrics set forth in this press release, to track AspenTech’s business performance. None of these non-GAAP metrics should be considered as an alternative to any measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nConference Call and Webcast\nAspenTech will host a conference call and webcast today, April 25, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. (Eastern Time), to discuss the company's financial results for the third quarter fiscal year 2018 as well as the company’s business outlook.\nThe live dial-in number is (866) 604-6127 or (443) 961-0460, conference ID code 2986139.

The income tax rate used for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018 reflects the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law on December 22, 2017, with an effective date of January 1, 2018. The income tax effect on non-GAAP items for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017 is calculated utilizing the Company's estimated federal and state tax rate.\n(d) Excess tax benefits are related to stock-based compensation tax deductions in excess of book compensation expense and reduce the Company’s income taxes payable. The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU No. 2016-09”) effective July 1, 2017. The Company adopted the cash flow presentation prospectively, and accordingly, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $1.2 million and $2.1 million is presented as an operating activity as a component of net income for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2018, respectively, while $1.3 million and $2.3 million of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation is presented as a financing activity for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2017, respectively.\n(e) In the nine months ended March 31, 2017, the Company acquired technology that did not meet the accounting requirements for capitalization and therefore the cost of the acquired technology was expensed as research and development. The Company has excluded the expense of the acquired technology from non-GAAP operating income to be consistent with transactions where the acquired assets were capitalized. In the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company has excluded payments of $0.1 million and $0.8 million, respectively, for non-capitalized acquired technology (including $0.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively, of final payments related to non-capitalized acquired technology from prior fiscal periods) from free cash flow to be consistent with the treatment of other transactions where the acquired assets were capitalized.\nView source version on businesswire.com : https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180425006648/en/\nMedia Contact\nAspenTech\nDavid Grip, +1 781-221-5273\ndavid.grip@aspentech.com\nor\nInvestor Contact\nICR\nBrian Denyeau, +1 646-277-1251\nbrian.denyeau@icrinc.com\nSource: Aspen Technology, Inc.",
