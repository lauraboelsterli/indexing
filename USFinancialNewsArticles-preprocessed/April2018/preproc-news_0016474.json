    "text": "Reuters - ** In wake of plunge that saw Facebook FB.O press against significant support (Full Story), shares attempting to show their good side again on the charts\nFILE PHOTO: Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, appears on stage during a town hall at Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S., September 27, 2015. REUTERS/Stephen Lam/File Photo ** That said, FB still has work to do to suggest recovery more than just a counter-trend bounce\n** Indeed, in wake of data issue, news of FTC probe , FB lost nearly a qtr of its value from early Feb peak into late Mar low\n** Despite weakness, FB did not see weekly closing violation of more than 4-year support line (log-scale, now ~$153.75). Chart: reut.rs/2GNELvx\n** And Mar 26 low ($149.02) just above 100-WMA (now $148.02); 100-WMA contained Aug 2015 swoon\n** Ahead of CEO Mark Zuckerbergâ€™s appearance in front of lawmakers at 2:15 PM ET (Full Story), shares up 1.4 pct, bringing recovery off recent trough to >7 pct\n** However, as FB tries to recover, Feb 9 low ($167.18) may prove to be stiff hurdle. Additionally, 200-DMA (now $173.08), ahead of resistance line from high (now ~$180)\n** Weekly close below support line/100-WMA can suggest risk for much more substantial decline; 200-WMA (now $118.39) may be magnet, as essentially coincides with support line from 2012\n** Meanwhile, recent FB decline contributed to FANG decay (Full Story), humbling of Tech Titans (Full Story). This as tech sector tripped (Full Story), market instability intensified (Full Story)\n** Price-weighted FANG composite still off ~12 pct from its Mar peak, but yet to break its 3+ year support line\n ",
