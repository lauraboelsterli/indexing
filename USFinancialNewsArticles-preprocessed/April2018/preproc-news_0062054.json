They have 93 points, two short of the Premier League best which was also set by Chelsea in 2004-2005.\n“We wanted to win today so that we can get the record of 96 points at home when we get the trophy in front of our people next week,” City manager Pep Guardiola said. Soccer Football - Premier League - West Ham United v Manchester City - London Stadium, London, Britain - April 29, 2018 West Ham United's Arthur Masuaku in action with Manchester City's Danilo REUTERS/David Klein\nAdrian started in goal for West Ham, with loanee Joe Hart unable to face his parent club, but the Spaniard could do nothing as Sane — back in the team at the expense of David Silva — saw his powerful strike go in off Evra’s head.\nSoon enough it was two as Zabaleta put through his own net against his former club.\n“We didn’t do things as well as we should,” West Ham manager David Moyes said. You need things to go for you and a bit of good fortune when you play a team like Manchester City.”\nWest Ham did improve and got themselves back in the match after Cresswell curled a free kick into the bottom corner.\nThe West Ham fans’ joy was short-lived, however, as City upped the ante after the break.
