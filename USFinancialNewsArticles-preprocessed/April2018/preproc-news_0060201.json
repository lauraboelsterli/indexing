    "text": " 40 AM / Updated 5 minutes ago UPDATE 1-Rusal shareholder says changes needed in response to U.S. sanctions Reuters Staff 3 Min Read\n(Adds quotes and context)\nMOSCOW, SUAL Partners, a co-owner of Russian aluminium producer Rusal, said on Monday that Rusal’s board and shareholders needed to start work as soon as possible on a new strategy after the company was hit by U.S. sanctions.\nWashington this month imposed sanctions on billionaire Oleg Deripaska and several companies in which he is a prominent shareholder, including Rusal, in response to what the United States called Russia’s “malign activities.”\nSUAL Partners is Russian billionaire Viktor Vekselberg’s investment vehicle and owner of a 22.5 percent stake in Rusal.\nThe company will take “all necessary steps to facilitate the swift lifting of U.S. Treasury Department sanctions on Rusal,” SUAL Partners representative Andrei Shtorkh said in a statement sent to Reuters.\n“At the same time, SUAL Partners believe that in these circumstances Rusal cannot keep working and evolving in the same way as it did before,” Shtorkh said.\n“Serious transformations, reflecting the new reality, must be carried out. For this purpose, the board of directors and the shareholders of Rusal must swiftly start discussions on the company’s new strategy, which will determine the new thrust of its development in the short and longer term.”\nA Rusal spokeswoman, asked about the SUAL statement, said she had no immediate comment.\nSwiss-based trading and mining giant Glencore, also a Rusal shareholder and one of its biggest customers, declined to comment on the SUAL statement.\nRusal has been considering a range of measures in a bid to convince the U.S. Treasury Department to lift the sanctions, which have led customers to stop buying its aluminium and sent creditors in a scramble to offload debt.\nIt is planning a major overhaul of its board and management, sources close to the company told Reuters last week.\nDeripaska has also agreed in principle to reduce his stake in En+, which holds a 48 percent share of Rusal, after the United States said it could remove Rusal from the sanctions list if the sanctioned businessman ceded control.\nHowever, a spokesperson for the U.S. Treasury said this did not guarantee the end of sanctions for the company.\nVekselberg and his Renova Group conglomerate were also included on the U.S. sanctions list.
