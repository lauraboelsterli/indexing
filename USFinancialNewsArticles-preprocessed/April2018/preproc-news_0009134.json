    "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 04, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cannabis Wheaton Income Corp. (TSX-V:CBW) (\" Cannabis Wheaton \" or the \" Company \") announces that it has entered into a definitive acquisition agreement (the “ Acquisition Agreement ”) to acquire all of the outstanding securities of Dosecann Inc. (“ Dosecann ”). Dosecann is a late-stage “Licensed Dealer” applicant pursuant to the Narcotic Control Regulations with a purpose-built 42,000 square foot facility located in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island.\nPursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, Cannabis Wheaton will acquire all of the outstanding securities of Dosecann (the “ Dosecann Securities ”) by way of a “three-cornered amalgamation” (the “ Acquisition ”). Upon the completion of the Acquisition, Dosecann will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cannabis Wheaton.\nAs consideration for the Dosecann Securities, the Company will pay the holders of the Dosecann Securities an aggregate of up to $38,000,000, payable in common shares of Cannabis Wheaton (the “ Consideration Shares ”), subject to the satisfaction of certain post-closing time and performance-based milestones. As part of the Acquisition, all outstanding convertible securities of Dosecann will either be converted into Dosecann common shares and exchanged for Consideration Shares on the closing of the Acquisition (the “ Closing ”), or will otherwise be exchanged for convertible securities of Cannabis Wheaton based on the exchange ratio used in the Acquisition.\nThe Dosecann principals, who collectively hold approximately 66.96% of the outstanding common shares of Dosecann, have agreed to enter into lock-up agreements in favour of Cannabis Wheaton restricting their ability to transfer their Consideration Shares (the “ Locked-up Securities ”) until the date that is 18 months following the Closing, provided that: (i) one-half of the Locked-Up Securities shall cease to be subject to the lock-up on the date that is 6 months following the Closing; and (ii) the remaining Locked-Up Securities shall cease to be subject to the lock-up in equal tranches on the 12 th and 18 th month anniversaries of the Closing.\nThe Acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of all required shareholder and regulatory approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions of closing under the Acquisition Agreement. The Transaction is expected to close on or about April 30, 2018.\nON BEHALF OF THE BOARD\n\" Chuck Rifici \" Chairman & CEO\nAbout Cannabis Wheaton (TSX-V:CBW)\nCannabis Wheaton is a collective of entrepreneurs with a passion for the cannabis industry past, present and future.
