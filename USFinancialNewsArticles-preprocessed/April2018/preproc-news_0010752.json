    "text": "April 6, 2018 / 6:29 AM / in 34 minutes Chevron seeks extension of Rokan block contract in Indonesia beyond 2021 Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nJAKARTA, April 6 (Reuters) - \n* Chevron has submitted a proposal to extend its contract to operate the Rokan block in Indonesia beyond 2021, Deputy Energy Minister Arcandra Tahar said on Friday. \n* Chevron’s proposal is now being evaluated by upstream oil and gas regulator SKKMigas, Tahar said. \n* “Apparently the seven sisters are still interested in investing in Indonesia,” he said. \n* The Rokan block is Indonesia’s single largest source of crude oil. \n* The government was currently evaluating 23 oil and gas contracts due to expire up to 2026, and will prioritise decisions on those expiring soonest, Tahar said.
