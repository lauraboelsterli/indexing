With   sea.   Trump said on Twitter.\nWhite House officials could not be immediately reached to comment on any action the Trump administration planned to take regarding oil or OPEC, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.\nAfter the president's tweet, Brent and WTI crude prices turned negative.\nOPEC member countries are slated to meet in June in Vienna to decide their next steps after reducing output since January 2017 in a move aimed at supporting prices.\nTop oil exporter Saudi Arabia would be happy to see crude rise to $80 or even $100 a barrel, three industry sources have told Reuters, a sign Riyadh will seek no changes to an OPEC supply-cutting deal even though the agreement's original target is within sight.
