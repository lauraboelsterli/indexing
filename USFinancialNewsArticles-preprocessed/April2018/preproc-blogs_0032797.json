    "text": "Check out the companies making headlines before the bell:\nMorgan Stanley – The firm reported quarterly profit of $1.45 per share , 20 cents a share above estimates. Revenue also beat forecasts. CEO James Gorman said results were strong across all business and in all regions.\nTextron – The maker of the Bell Helicopter and Cessna aircraft brands reported quarterly profit of 72 cents per share, well above the consensus estimate of 48 cents a share. Revenue also topped forecasts. Separately, Textron announced the sale of its tools and test equipment business to Emerson Electric for $810 million.\nIBM – IBM reported adjusted first-quarter profit of $2.45 per share , beating estimates by 3 cents a share. Revenue also exceeded forecasts, however shares are under pressure this morning after the company issued a lower-than-expected full-year profit forecast. Analysts say IBM's legacy hardware business is continuing to hurt growth and profit margins.\nUnited Continental – United came in 10 cents a share ahead of estimates , with adjusted first-quarter profit of 50 cents per share. The airline's revenue came in marginally above forecasts. Higher passenger fares helped negate the effects of higher fuel prices and a series of winter storms.\nCSX – CSX earned 78 cents per share for the first quarter , 12 cents a share ahead of consensus forecasts. The rail operator's revenue beat estimates, as well. The results were boosted by a substantial drop in its operating ratio, with expenses at 63.7 percent of revenue compared to 73.2 percent a year earlier.\nSouthwest Airlines – Southwest remains on watch following Tuesday's accident that killed one passenger . The airline said it would fully cooperate with the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board as those agencies investigate the accident.\nAmazon.com – Amazon announced a new international shopping feature that allows customers from around the world to shop for items shipped from the United States. Amazon will offer a variety of shipping and currency options. Separately, Amazon and Best Buy are teaming up to sell Amazon Fire-powered smart TVs.\nTesla – Tesla wants to ramp up Model 3 production to 6,000 cars per week by the end of June, according to auto news website Electrek citing a letter to employees from CEO Elon Musk.\nIntuitive Surgical – The company reported adjusted quarterly profit of $2.44 per share, beating the consensus estimate of $2.07 a share. The medical device maker's revenue was well above forecasts, on increasing sales of its da Vinci robotic surgical device.\nNorwegian Cruise Line – Deutsche Bank upgraded the cruise line operator's stock to \"buy\" from \"hold,\" pointing to several positive factors including the possible initiation of a dividend and a closing of the valuation gap with rival Royal Caribbean .\nEBay – Morgan Stanley gave the online marketplace a double upgrade, raising its rating to \"overweight\" from \"underweight.\" Morgan Stanley bases its call on increasing ad revenue as well as higher volume driven by eBay's new payments system.\nLam Research – Lam earned an adjusted $4.79 per share for its latest quarter, 41 cents a share above estimates. The manufacturer of chipmaking equipment saw revenue match forecasts, and it gave stronger-than-expected guidance for the current quarter.\nVMWare — Activist investor Carl Icahn has taken a stake in VMWare , according to sources. The stake in the cloud computing company is described as \"medium-sized\" and Icahn's intentions are unclear.\nEthan Allen – Ethan Allen expects to have higher marketing costs and delayed deliveries for its third quarter, resulting in lower than expected earnings for the furniture retailer.\nRiot Blockchain — The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued a subpoena to the cryptocurrency company whose stock skyrocketed after changing its name, the company said on Tuesday.",
