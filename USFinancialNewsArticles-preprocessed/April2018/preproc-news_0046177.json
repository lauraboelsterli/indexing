    "text": "SHANGHAI, April 25, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ReneSola Ltd (\"ReneSola\" or the \"Company\") ( www.renesolapower.com ) (NYSE: SOL), a leading solar project developer and operator, today announced its unaudited financial results from continuing operations for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017.\nUnless otherwise specified, the results presented herein exclude discontinued operations. Discontinued operations relate to the Company's manufacturing business (including polysilicon, solar wafer, solar cell and solar module manufacturing) and LED distribution business which were disposed of in the third quarter of 2017. The Company's full financial results including discontinued operations are not available at this time.\nMr. Xianshou Li, ReneSola's Chief Executive Officer, commented, \"2017 was a transformative year for the Company. We exited the manufacturing business, becoming a pure play in the rapidly growing project development market. As a result, the fundamentals for our project business significantly improved. We achieved profitability and maintained a healthy balance sheet, providing the financial flexibility to drive growth. In 2017, we successfully connected 270 MW of solar rooftop projects in China and entered into the Hungarian market with a pipeline of 38.4 MW. Additionally, our overall solar power project pipeline remains solid at around 1.1 GW.\"\nLi continued, \"Fourth quarter results were largely in-line with our expectations. On a year-over-year basis, Q4 revenue growth was over 60%, and operating income was up over 136%. We remain excited about the opportunities ahead of us, and believe that our talented team, diversified geographic coverage and track record of success at every stage of project development will position us for profitable growth.\"\nFourth Quarter 201 7 Highlights\nQ4 2017\n($ in million)\nQ/Q Change\nY/Y Change\nRevenue\n$64.8\n+78.6%\n+61.1%\nGross Profit\n$6.8\n+7.3%\n+71.5%\nOperating Income\n$4.9\n+28.2%\n+136.1%\nEBITDA\n$4.7\n-28.6%\n+94.5%\nIncome (loss) before Income\nTax and Noncontrolling interests from\nContinuing Operations\n$2.0\n-49.8%\n+14.8%\nRevenue was $64.8 million, compared to the guidance range of $55 million to $60 million; Gross margin was 10.5%, compared to 17.5% in Q3 2017 and 9.9% in Q4 2016; Income before income tax and noncontrolling interests from continuing operations was $2.0 million, compared to $4.0 million in Q3 2017 and $1.7 million in Q4 2016; Recognized revenue of $44.4 million from sales of distributed generation (DG) projects in China, community solar projects in the United States and utility projects in Turkey; Recognized revenue of $15.4 million from EPC services for 25 MW of DG projects in China; Recognized revenue from the sale of electricity of $5.0 million; Connected 76.8 MW of rooftop projects in China which the Company intends to hold; and Solar power project pipeline of approximately 1.1 GW, of which 546.5 MW are late-stage.\nFull Year 2017 Highlights\n2017\n($ in million)\n2016\n($ in million)\nY/Y Change\nRevenue\n$103.0\n$80.5\n+27.9%\nGross Profit\n$14.1\n$7.2\n+95.4%\nOperating Income\n$6.6\n$2.3\n+179.1%\nEBITDA\n$11.6\n$4.7\n+149.4%\nIncome (loss) before Income Tax\nand Noncontrolling interests from\nContinuing Operations\n$3.5\n$0.2\n+1,447.6%\nRevenue increased 27.9% to $103.0 million from $80.5 million in 2016; Gross margin was 13.7%, compared to 9.0% in 2016; Income before income tax and noncontrolling interests from continuing operations was $3.5 million, compared to $0.2 million in 2016; Recognized revenue of $64.8 million from sales of solar projects; Recognized revenue of $25.9 million from the EPC business; Recognized revenue from the sale of electricity of $12.3 million; and Connected a total of 270 MW of rooftop projects in China.\nFourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results\nRevenue from continuing operations was $64.8 million was up 78.6% q/q and up 61.2% y/y.\nRevenue from the Project Development business was $44.4 million as we recognized revenue from sales of projects of 44.2 MW in China, 8.1 MW in Turkey and 13.3 MW in Minnesota.
