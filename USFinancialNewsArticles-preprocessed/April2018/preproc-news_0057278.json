As such, they are subject to the occurrence of many events outside Omnicell's control and are subject to various risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement. Such statements include, but are not limited to, Omnicell's pipeline, new products and solutions yet to be generally available, new sales opportunities, and projected bookings, revenue, profit and market share growth. Risks that contribute to the uncertain nature of the include (i) our ability to take advantage of the growth opportunities in medication management across the spectrum of healthcare settings from the hospital, long-term care, to home care, (ii) our ability to develop and commercialize new products, including the XR2 Automated Central Pharmacy System and the IVX Workflow semi-automated workflow solution, and lead the digital healthcare transformation, (iii) unfavorable general economic and market conditions, (iv) risks to growth and acceptance of our products and services, including competitive conversions, (v) growth of the clinical automation and workflow automation market generally, (vi) potential of increasing competition, (vii) potential regulatory changes, (viii) our ability to improve sales productivity to grow product bookings and (ix) our ability to acquire and successfully integrate companies. These and other risks and uncertainties are described more fully in Omnicell's most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on . All contained in this press release speak only as of the date on which they were made. Omnicell undertakes no obligation to update such statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Information\nThis press release contains financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our management evaluates and makes operating decisions using various performance measures. In addition to Omnicell's GAAP results, we also consider non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share. Additionally, we calculate Adjusted EBITDA (another non-GAAP measure) by means of adjustments to GAAP Net Income. These non-GAAP results should not be considered as an alternative to gross profit, operating expenses, net income, net income per diluted share, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. We present these non-GAAP results because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of Omnicell's performance.\nOur non-GAAP revenue, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share are exclusive of certain items to facilitate management's review of the comparability of Omnicell's core operating results on a period to period basis because such items are not related to Omnicell's ongoing core operating results as viewed by management. We define our \"core operating results\" as those revenues recorded in a particular period and the expenses incurred within that period that directly drive operating income in that period. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making operating decisions because, in addition to meaningful supplemental information regarding operating performance, the measures give us a better understanding of how we should invest in research and development, fund infrastructure growth and evaluate the effectiveness of marketing strategies. In calculating the above non-GAAP results, management specifically adjusted for the following excluded items:\na) Share-based compensation expense. We excluded from our non-GAAP results the expense related to equity-based compensation plans as they represent expenses that do not require cash settlement from Omnicell.\nb) Amortization of acquired intangible assets. We excluded from our non-GAAP results the intangible assets amortization expense resulting from our past acquisitions. These non-cash charges are not considered by management to reflect the core cash-generating performance of the business and therefore are excluded from our non-GAAP results.\nc) Amortization of debt issuance cost. Debt issuance cost represents costs associated with the issuance of Term Loan and Revolving Line of Credit facilities. The cost includes underwriting fees, original issue discount, ticking fee, and legal fees. This non-cash expense is not considered by management to reflect the core cash-generating performance of the business and therefore is excluded from our non-GAAP results.\nd) Acquisition accounting impact related to deferred revenue. In connection with recent acquisitions, business combination rules require us to account for the fair values of arrangements for which acceptance has not been obtained, and post installation support has not been provided in our purchase accounting. The non-GAAP adjustment to our revenues is intended to include the full amounts of such revenues. We believe the adjustment to these revenues is useful as a measure of the ongoing performance of our business.\ne) Inventory fair value adjustments. In connection with the acquisition of Aesynt, business combination rules require us to account for the fair values of inventory acquired in our purchase accounting. The non-GAAP adjustment to the cost of revenues is intended to include the impact of such adjustment. We believe the adjustment is useful as a measure of the ongoing performance of our business.\nf) Acquisition-related expenses. We excluded from the non-GAAP results the expenses which are related to recent acquisitions. These expenses are unrelated to our ongoing operations and we do not expect them to occur in the ordinary course of business. We believe that excluding these acquisition-related expenses provides more meaningful comparisons of the financial results to our historical operations and forward-looking guidance and the financial results of less acquisitive peer companies.\ng) Severance and other related expenses. We excluded from our non-GAAP results the expenses which are related to restructuring events. These expenses are unrelated to our ongoing operations and we do not expect them to occur in the ordinary course of business. We believe that excluding these expenses provides more meaningful comparisons of the financial results to our historical operations and forward-looking guidance and the financial results of peer companies.\nh) Tax reform impact. We excluded from our non-GAAP results the net one-time benefits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 based on the estimated impact of the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. These net benefits are unrelated to our ongoing operations and we do not expect them to occur in the ordinary course of business. We believe that excluding these net benefits provides more meaningful comparisons of the financial results to our historical operations and forward-looking guidance and the financial results of peer companies.\ni) Tax impact from restructuring activity. We excluded from our non-GAAP results the tax impacts related to restructuring activity. These impacts are unrelated to our ongoing operations and we do not expect them to occur in the ordinary course of business. We believe that excluding these impacts provides more meaningful comparisons of the financial results to our historical operations and forward-looking guidance and the financial results of peer companies.\nManagement adjusts for the above items because management believes that, in general, these items possess one or more of the following characteristics: their magnitude and timing is largely outside of Omnicell's control; they are unrelated to the ongoing operation of the business in the ordinary course; they are unusual and we do not expect them to occur in the ordinary course of business; or they are non-operational, or non-cash expenses involving stock compensation plans or other items.\nWe believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is warranted for several reasons:\n1) Such non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional analytical tool for understanding Omnicell's financial performance by excluding the impact of items which may obscure trends in the core operating results of the business;\n2) Since we have historically reported non-GAAP results to the investment community, we believe the inclusion of non-GAAP numbers provides consistency and enhances investors' ability to compare our performance across financial reporting periods;\n3) These non-GAAP financial measures are employed by Omnicell's management in its own evaluation of performance and are utilized in financial and operational decision making processes, such as budget planning and forecasting; and\n4) These non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons to the operating results of other companies in our industry, which use similar financial measures to supplement their GAAP results, thus enhancing the perspective of investors who wish to utilize such comparisons in their analysis of our performance.\nSet forth below are additional reasons why share-based compensation expense is excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures:\ni) While share-based compensation calculated in accordance with ASC 718 constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense of Omnicell, it is not an expense that requires cash settlement by Omnicell. We therefore exclude these charges for purposes of evaluating core operating results. Thus, our non-GAAP measurements are presented exclusive of stock-based compensation expense to assist management and investors in evaluating our core operating results.\nii) We present ASC 718 share-based payment compensation expense in our reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures on a pre-tax basis because the exact tax differences related to the timing and deductibility of share-based compensation, under ASC 718 are dependent upon the trading price of Omnicell's common stock and the timing and exercise by employees of their stock options. As a result of these timing and market uncertainties the tax effect related to share-based compensation expense would be inconsistent in amount and frequency and is therefore excluded from our non-GAAP results.\nOur Adjusted EBITDA calculation is defined as earnings before interest income and expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and non-cash expenses, including ASC 718 stock compensation expense, as well as certain non-GAAP adjustments.\nAs stated above, we present non-GAAP financial measures because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of performance. However, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for Omnicell's GAAP results. In the future, we expect to incur expenses similar to certain of the non-GAAP adjustments described above and expect to continue reporting non-GAAP financial measures excluding such items. Some of the limitations in relying on non-GAAP financial measures are:\nOmnicell's stock option and stock purchase plans are important components of incentive compensation arrangements and will be reflected as expenses in Omnicell's GAAP results for the foreseeable future under ASC 718. Other companies, including companies in Omnicell's industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than Omnicell, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.\nPursuant to the requirements of SEC Regulation G, a detailed reconciliation between Omnicell's non-GAAP and GAAP financial results is set forth in the financial tables at the end of this press release. Investors are advised to carefully review and consider this information strictly as a supplement to the GAAP results that are contained in this press release and in Omnicell's SEC filings.\nWith respect to the Company's expectations under \"2018 Guidance\" above, and regarding certain projections discussed on today's teleconference, reconciliation of non-GAAP earnings ranges per share guidance for 2018, to the closest corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable efforts as we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the matters we would allocate to \"certain items,\" including unusual gains and losses, costs associated with future restructurings, acquisition-related expenses and litigation outcomes. These items are uncertain, complex, depend on various factors, have low visibility and could have a material impact on GAAP EPS in future periods.\nOmnicell, Inc.\nCondensed Consolidated Statements of
