Far-right supporter arrives for the rock music festival \"Schwert und Schild\" (Sword and Shield) in Ostritz, Germany April 20, 2018. Sign reads \"Adolf is the best\". REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke \nThe far-right “Schild und Schwert” (“Shield and Sword”) festival is being held in the Polish border town of Ostritz from April 20 to April 21. Hitler was born in Austria on April 20, 1889. \nFar-right merchandise, including T-Shirts with the slogan “I (heart) HTLR” were on sale at the event, as were toy tanks. \nOne sign read “Aryan brotherhood” and a poster from the far-right National Democratic Party protested against the influx of more than a million migrants to Germany since mid-2015 with the slogan: “Nursery schools instead of asylum camps”. \nPolice officers were out in force, carrying out checks on roads near the festival and the train station. They said they had arrested a 31-year-old who made an illegal “Heil Hitler” salute. Far-right supporters attend the rock music festival \"Schwert und Schild\" (Sword and Shield) in Ostritz, Germany April 20, 2018. Sign (L) reads \"Adolf was the best\". REUTERS/Hannibal Hanschke \nGermany has strict laws on hate speech and symbols linked to Hitler and the Nazis, who ruled between 1933 and 1945. \nAlongside the festival for peace in the market square of Ostritz, which runs until Sunday and which some German media reported had more than 1,000 attendees on Friday, police said there would also be a cycling event to protest against the far-right on Saturday. \nMichael Kretschmer, premier of the eastern state of Saxony where Ostritz is located, said local residents and churches had organised the festival for peace of their own accord.
