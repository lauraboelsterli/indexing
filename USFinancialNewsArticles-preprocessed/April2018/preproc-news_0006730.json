This year looks to be OK, but if this kind of trade war stuff does escalate, that could put a dampener on things,” Khalaf added.\nWorries over global trade and a tumble in U.S. heavyweight tech stocks has hit risk assets so far this year, while a spate of profit warnings and ongoing Brexit-related uncertainty has dented appetite for British stocks.\nThe FTSE 100 slid in line with the broader European market, with financials, industrials and health stocks shaving the most points off the index.\nA rise in the pound also put pressure on large, overseas-earning stocks such as Reckitt Benckiser and Diageo which declined 1.7 percent and 0.8 percent respectively.\nMining stocks were a bright spot as solid manufacturing data from China, the world’s biggest consumer of metals, boosted the price of copper to a one-week high.\nShares in Glencore, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto all rose 0.1 to 0.3 percent, while precious metals miner Randgold Resources gained 0.9 percent.\nThe FTSE’s muted start to the second quarter follows its worst first quarter since 2011, while March saw its third month of declines in a row.
