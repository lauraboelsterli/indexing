    "text": "April 30, 2018 / 9:50 AM / Updated 6 minutes ago BASF wins conditional EU approval to buy Bayer assets Reuters Staff 1 Min Read\nBRUSSELS, April 30 (Reuters) - German chemicals maker BASF secured EU antitrust approval on Monday to acquire a package of businesses from Bayer after pledging to sell some assets to address competition concerns.\nThe European Commission said the concessions addressed concerns that the deal may reduce innovation for some herbicides and certain seed treatments.\nThe EU competition enforcer said BASF will sell one of the overlapping lines of research for the development of non-selective herbicides and its nematicidal seed treatment product Trunemco.\nBASF is acquiring some of Bayerâ€™s seed and herbicide assets, its global vegetable seeds business, its digital farming business and certain seed treatments.\nGerman drug and crop chemical maker Bayer is selling the assets in return for EU approval for its $62.5 billion acquisition of U.S. peer Monsanto. It received the go-ahead last month. (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek)",
