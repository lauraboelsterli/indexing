Subscribe to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity for in-depth coverage on cybersecurity trends, breaches and best practices. Good morning, CIOs. Strong demand for software is leading IT spending to the biggest gain in a decade, Gartner Inc. says in a new forecast. Worldwide spending on information technology is expected to reach $3.7 trillion in 2018, a 6.2% over last year. It’s the highest annual growth rate that Gartner has forecast since 2007.\nGartner chief forecaster John-David Lovelock attributes the outlook to a declining U.S. dollar and growing demand for enterprise software. “Instead of owning a server, you’re getting compute as a service. Instead of having a phone line, you’re using (voice over internet services),” he tells CIO Journal’s Sara Castellanos . “Everything is shifting to the digital twin alternative.”\nSpending on enterprise software is expected to reach $391 billion in 2018, an 11.1% increase over last year and the highest growth market in IT spending for 2018, according to the report, released Monday. That’s largely due to the trend toward digital transformation and a change in the dynamics from an “ownership preference” to a “service preference,” Mr. Lovelock said.\nIT hiring slows in March. Hiring for information-technology jobs at U.S. companies outside of the technology industry slowed in March, but remained in positive territory for the year, CompTIA reported Friday. The number of IT jobs declined by roughly 50,000 jobs last month, following strong gains at the start of the year, the trade group said. Since January, U.S. employers at non-tech firms have created a net 180,000 new IT jobs, a CompTIA spokesman told CIO Journal .\nTECHNOLOGY NEWS \nMark Zuckerberg in Washington on Monday. YURI GRIPAS/BLOOMBERG Facebook goes to Washington. CEO Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify on Capitol Hill on Tuesday at a hearing hosted by the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and the Judiciary Committee, and then Wednesday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Facebook Inc. on Monday released Mr. Zuckerberg’s prepared testimony , which will be delivered at each hearing: “It’s clear now that we didn’t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm as well,” reads the transcript.\nFive things to watch for. 1. Can Mr. Zuckerberg project contrition in an unscripted setting? 2. Will Facebook disclose more bad news? 3. Is there momentum for legislation or regulation? 4. Why did Facebook wait so long to make policy changes? 5. Will election-year politics complicate the atmospherics? The Journal’s Siobhan Hughes has more.\nCrisis hits campus. There are some signs that Facebook’s crisis is having an effect on luring talent, according to the WSJ . Since the disclosures, more candidates for jobs in some units at Facebook have withdrawn from consideration than during any other period in memory, according to a person familiar with the company’s recruiting.\nZuckerberg responds to Myanmar criticism. The New York Times reports that after activists there complained that the social network was not doing enough to clamp down on violence-inciting hate speech, Mr. Zuckerberg responded via email, saying the company “added dozens more Burmese language reviewers to handle reports from users across all our services.”\nVietnam activists accuse Facebook of cooperating with authorities. Human rights activists wrote to Mr. Zuckerberg saying the platform works with communist authorities to take down content. The FT notes that south-east Asia is one of Facebook’s fastest growing regions.\nOne of Facebook’s co-founders piles on. “It’s shocking to me that they didn’t have to answer more of these questions earlier on,” said Chris Hughes, one of the earliest Facebook employees, at an FT event . Mr. Hughes left the company in 2007 to direct the Barack Obama’s digital operations.\nWoz drops Facebook. Explaining his move, Appleco-founder Steve Wozniak tells USA Today that “Apple makes its money off of good products, not off of you.”\nSAP SE unveils new pricing system as cloud, IoT redefine usage. A new pricing model, “indirect access,” will replace the decades-old practice of charging by the number of seats. “The changes mean customers pay handling fees only when significant business processes or outcomes are achieved, rather than simply because a random technical process was triggered, indirectly, through an SAP software system,” Reuters reports .\nSlammed by Trump, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos chooses silence. Over the past week, the world’s richest man has been cast into the limelight thanks to a string of attacks by President Donald Trump. Mr. Bezos’s response? Nada. That strategy, people familiar with this thinking tell the WSJ’s Laura Stevens and Peter Nicholas , fits in with his deeply held conviction in playing the long game.\nBespoke clothes with the click of a button. Fashion labels like Isabella Wren are delivering custom-made clothes and shoes from China to the U.S. within two weeks, using a “click, buy and make” business model, the WSJ’s Natasha Khan reports . Isabella Wren’s software allows clients to generate customized patterns not only for dresses, but also for jackets, blouses and trousers.\nL’startups, tres chic. Luxury-goods maker LVMH is taking space in Station F, a startup incubator in Paris. Reuters reports that interest in tech projects is growing among luxury and beauty companies, with many investing in new fabrics and connected objects, as well as better online retail.\nTech companies tops in R&D. Amazon.com Inc. won 2017, spending $22.6 billion on research and development in 2017, Recode reports . Rivals Alphabet Inc. , Intel Corp. , Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. claimed the second through fifth spots.\nApple embraces clean power. The company says that all of its facilities are running off of clean energy, which includes wind and solar power. Facilities include the company’s data centers, offices and retail stores, Reuters reports .\nEVERYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW \nPresident Trump slammed what he called a “disgrace” and a “witch hunt” after federal investigators seized communications from his longtime lawyer, Michael Cohen . (WSJ)\nThe Congressional Budget Office said the federal budget deficit would total $804 billion this year, 43% higher than it had projected last summer , and exceed $1 trillion a year starting in 2020. (WSJ)\nPresident Trump said Monday he is likely to decide by the end of the day or Tuesday morning about the U.S. response to a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria that killed dozens of civilians. (WSJ)\nThe Justice Department will allow Bayer’s megadeal to acquire Monsanto after the companies pledged to sell off additional assets to secure government antitrust approval.
