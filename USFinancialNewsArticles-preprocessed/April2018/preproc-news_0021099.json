    "text": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg returns to Capitol Hill on Wednesday a day after answering questions from the Senate Judiciary and Commerce committees. \n\nIn an hours-long grilling Tuesday, the questions ranged from the social network's role in the 2016 presidential elections to how the company handles data. \nHere are the key moments.\nFacebook did not notify FTC about data leak Zuckerberg said Facebook did not notify the Federal Trade Commission about the Cambridge Analytica data leak from 2015 because the company \"considered it a closed case.\" \nThe profiles of 87 million Facebook users were harvested by a quiz app with the data being sold to political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which supported Donald Trump in the election. Facebook demanded the maker of the quiz app as well as Cambridge Analytica delete the data. The social network was assured that this was done in 2015, but recent reports suggest that the data still exists. Cambridge Analytica denies this. \nshow chapters Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook didn't notify FTC of leak: 'We considered it a closed case'      3:39 PM ET Tue, 10 April 2018 | 02:46 Facebook admitted it hadn't checked the data was erased after it made the request to Cambridge Analytica to do so. \n\"We considered it a closed case. In retrospect that was clearly a mistake. We shouldn't have taken their word for it,\" Zuckerberg told the senators.\nContact with Mueller  Facebook is \"working\" with special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, according to Zuckerberg . He said he had not been personally interviewed by Mueller's team, but that others in the company had. \nshow chapters Zuckerberg: We're working with the Special Counsel      3:56 PM ET Tue, 10 April 2018 | 05:17 \"I want to be careful here, because that work is confidential. We are in open session and I don't want to reveal anything that is confidential,\" Zuckerberg said.\n'You don't think you have a monopoly?' There was a heated exchange between Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Zuckerberg over whether Facebook is a monopoly or not. \nGraham asked Zuckerberg to name competitors and he cited Google , Apple , Amazon and Microsoft . The senator then kept probing and eventually asked, \"You don't think you have a monopoly?\" \nZuckerberg said: \"Doesn't feel like that to me.\"\nRead the full exchange here . \nHow will Facebook handle future election meddling? Confidently. That's the message from Zuckerberg who said he feels the social network is well equipped to handle upcoming votes such as the 2018 U.S. midterms and elections in countries like India and Brazil. \n\"This is an arms race. They're (potential groups that want to intervene) going to keep on getting better at this. And we need to invest in keeping on getting better at this too,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\"I have more confidence that we're going to get this right,\" he added.\nRegulation Zuckerberg walked a fine line showing that he was open to regulations, but nothing that would fundamentally blow apart Facebook's business model.\n\"My position is not that there should be no regulation,\" Zuckerberg said. \nshow chapters Zuckerberg: We welcome regulation if it's right      4:08 PM ET Tue, 10 April 2018 | 05:46 \"I think the real question, as the internet becomes more important in people's lives, is what is the right regulation, not whether there should be or not.\"\nA paid version of Facebook? \nFacebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg told",
