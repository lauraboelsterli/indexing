    "text": "BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators have set a May 8 deadline to decide whether to allow Italian cable maker Prysmian’s ( PRY.MI ) $3 billion acquisition of U.S. peer General Cable ( BGC.N ).\nPrysmian, which sells cable to the energy and telecoms sectors, sought approval from the European Commission on March 28, a filing on the EU authority’s website showed on Tuesday.\nThe Commission can clear the deal with or without concessions or it can launch a four-month investigation if it has serious concerns the takeover may hurt rivals and customers.\nThe takeover gained unconditional clearance in the United States on March 9.\nReporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Jason Neely\n ",
