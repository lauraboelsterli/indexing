    "text": "SHANGHAI, eHi Car Services Limited (\"eHi\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: EHIC), a leading car rental and car services provider in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the full year ended December 31, 2017.\nUnaudited Full Year 2017 Financial Results\nNet revenues for the full year of 2017 were RMB2,739.5 million (US$421.1 million), up 29.9% compared with the full year of 2016, attributable to increases in net revenues from both car rentals and car services.\nRevenues from car rentals for the full year of 2017 were RMB2,196.5 million (US$337.6 million), up 32.0% compared with the full year of 2016, primarily driven by the growing average available fleet size for car rentals in response to customer demand.\nRevenues from car services for the full year of 2017 were RMB543.1 million (US$83.5 million), up 21.9% compared with the full year of 2016, primarily driven by increased demand from existing and new customers for car services.\nCost of revenues (vehicle operating expenses) for the full year of 2017 were RMB1,880.3 million (US$289.0 million), up 24.1% compared with the full year of 2016, primarily due to increased depreciation and labor costs.\nIn 2017, 13,870 used vehicles were disposed of, and 936 used vehicles were under sales contracts pending title transfer. The Company recorded a disposal gain of RMB24.2 million (US$3.7 million) in aggregate for these 14,806 vehicles 1 . The gain was recognized as an adjustment to the vehicle related depreciation expense as part of the cost of revenues.\nGross profit for the full year of 2017 was RMB859.2 million (US$132.1 million), up 44.7% year-over-year. Gross profit margin for the full year of 2017 was 31.4%, compared with 28.1% for the full year of 2016.\nSelling and marketing expenses for the full year of 2017 were RMB139.0 million (US$21.4 million), up 43.1% compared with the full year of 2016 primarily due to increased sales and promotion activities in 2017.\nG eneral and administrative expenses for the full year of 2017 were RMB270.7 million (US$41.6 million), up 7.4% compared with the full year of 2016, primarily due to increases in employee-related costs such as salaries and welfare expenses as a result of increased headcount.\nProfit from operations for the full year of 2017 was RMB453.2 million (US$69.7 million), up 77.8% compared with the full year of 2016.\nInterest expense for the full year of 2017 was RMB280.6 million (US$43.1 million), up 24.7% compared with the full year of 2016, primarily attributable to the interest expense associated with the Company's US$400 million senior unsecured notes that was issued in August 2017.\nNet income for the full year of 2017 was RMB122.2 million (US$18.8 million), compared with RMB33.1 million for the full year of 2016. Net income margin for the full year of 2017 was 4.5%, up approximately 290 basis points from 1.6% for the full year of 2016.\nBasic and diluted earnings per ADS for the full year of 2017 were RMB1.76 and RMB1.75 (US$0.27 and US$0.27), respectively, compared with basic and diluted earnings per ADS of RMB0.48 each, for the full year of 2016.\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBIT for the full year of 2017 was RMB472.7 million (US$72.7 million), up 73.6% compared with the full year of 2016. Non-GAAP adjusted EBIT margin for the full year of 2017 was 17.3%, compared with 12.9% for the full year of 2016.\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA for the full year of 2017 was RMB1,227.8 million (US$188.7 million), up 30.6% compared with the full year of 2016. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year of 2017 was 44.8%, compared with 44.6% for the full year of 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company's cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balance was RMB1,283.5 million (US$197.3 million) and RMB786.6 million, respectively.\n1 The gain of RMB24.2 million is a net amount of (i) the disposal gain and loss of the 13,870 used vehicles which were disposed of, and (ii) the disposal loss of the 936 used vehicles which were under sales contracts pending title transfer. If there is any disposal gain for the vehicles pending title transfer, such a gain will be recognized in the next period when the title transfer has been completed.\nAbout eHi Car Services Limited\neHi Car Services Limited (NYSE: EHIC) is one of the leading car rental and car services providers in China.
