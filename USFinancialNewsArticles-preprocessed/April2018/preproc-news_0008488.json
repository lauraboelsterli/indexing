    "text": "April 6, 2018 / 12:18 PM / Updated 22 minutes ago Former Catalan leader leaves German prison after paying bail Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \nBERLIN (Reuters) - Catalonia’s former leader Carles Puigdemont walked out of a German prison on Friday after a court in the northern state of Schleswig-Holstein agreed to release him on bail, Reuters Television showed. Catalonia's former leader Carles Puigdemont waves to the media as he leaves the prison in Neumuenster, Germany, April 6, 2018. REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer \nThe court on Thursday rejected an extradition request on the charge of rebellion for Puigdemont’s role in the campaign for Catalonia’s independence, but said extradition to Spain was possible on a lesser charge of misuse of public funds. \nThe former Catalan leader, who wore a dark suit on leaving the prison in the German town of Neumuenster, was arrested last month on a Spanish-issued arrest warrant as he entered Germany.
