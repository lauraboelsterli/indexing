    "text": "(Reuters) - Australian champion mare Winx cruised to a record-equalling 25th consecutive victory with a dominant performance in the Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Sydney’s Randwick racecourse on Saturday.\nWinx’s win in the A$4 million ($3.11 million) event of the Sydney autumn carnival put her level with Black Caviar in the Australian record books.\nRidden by jockey Hugh Bowman, the six-year-old galloped to her 18th Group One triumph as she beat Gailo Chop by three and three-quarters lengths. Happy Clapper was third.\nBlack Caviar’s run included 15 Group One wins from 2008 until her retirement in 2013.\nWinx is now just four wins behind Irish hurdler Hurricane Fly, the now retired gelding which won 22 Group One races earlier this century.\nReporting by Shrivathsa Sridhar in Bengaluru; editing by Sudipto Ganguly\n ",
