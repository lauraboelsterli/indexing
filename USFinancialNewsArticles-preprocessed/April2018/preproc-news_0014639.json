    "text": "Kris Bryant had a home run and a triple, and the Chicago Cubs took advantage of two Milwaukee errors in the ninth inning to rally past the Brewers for a 5-2 win Saturday at Miller Park.\nTrailing 2-1 in the top of the ninth inning, the Cubs got RBIs from Ben Zobrist, Ian Happ and pinch-hitter Jon Lester to pull in front. Milwaukee third baseman Travis Shaw and shortstop Orlando Arcia committed errors in the ninth inning leading to two unearned runs for the Cubs.\nEric Thames hit a solo home run off Yu Darvish, and Lorenzo Cain drove in a go-ahead run in the eighth inning for the Brewers. Thames hit a 3-2 slider out to right field to open the fourth inning and give the Brewers a 1-0 lead. It was his third home run of the season and second of the series.\nDarvish was roughed up in his Cubs’ debut last week, surrendered five runs in 4 1/3 innings to the Miami Marlins. But the prized offseason acquisition had his good stuff Saturday. He cruised into the fourth inning, before giving up the home run to Thames, and regrouped to keep the Milwaukee bats quiet.\nDarvish allowed just two hits and one run, while striking out nine and walking one in six innings.\nMilwaukee starter Zach Davies matched Darvish pitch for pitch. He went six innings, allowing only Bryant’s home run in the sixth inning that tied the score 1-1.\nBryant pulled a 3-2 changeup over the left-center field wall for his second home run of the season and the 96th of his career.\nDavies allowed four hits, struck out eight and walked three.\nChicago first baseman Anthony Rizzo missed his second straight day with back tightness. Victor Caratini started in his place.\nThe series finale is Sunday. The Brewers will send right-hander Chase Anderson to the mound. Chicago will counter with left-hander Jose Quintana. Both starters will be looking for their first win of the season.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
