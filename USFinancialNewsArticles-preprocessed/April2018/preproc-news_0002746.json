    "text": "April 1, 2018 / 10:50 PM / Updated 8 hours ago Poulter wins Houston playoff to secure final Masters spot Reuters Staff 4 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Ian Poulter resurrected his stagnant career by winning the Houston Open in a playoff on Sunday, the victory coming with an added bonus of earning the final invitation to the U.S. Masters and throwing his hat into the ring for Europe’s Ryder Cup team.

Mandatory Credit: John Glaser-USA TODAY Sports \nPoulter was always heading to Augusta to work on the tournament for British television, but the 42-year-old Englishman will now be inside the ropes instead when the first major championship of the year starts on Thursday. \n“There’s life in the old dog yet,” Poulter said after beating American Beau Hossler on the first hole of a sudden death playoff at Golf Club of Houston. \nPoulter, without a win since 2012, arrived in Houston needing nothing less than victory to qualify for the Masters after missing out by a whisker when he found himself 51st in the world rankings last week. \nThe top 50 at last Monday’s cutoff earned exemption to Augusta and Poulter was so dejected after being initially misinformed he was in the Masters field that he considered skipping Houston. \n“Tuesday morning I made the decision to come and play. It was a good decision,” he added. “The win doesn’t just mean getting to Augusta. There’s a lot bigger things on the horizon.” Apr 1, 2018; Humble, TX, USA; Ian Poulter of England plays his shot from the second tee during final round of the Houston Open golf tournament at Golf Club of Houston - The Tournament Course. Mandatory Credit: John Glaser-USA TODAY Sports \nSuch as, hopefully, the Ryder Cup in France this autumn. Poulter, a five-times European team member, said his win would tell captain Thomas Bjorn: “Hey, I’m here, my game is in good shape.” \nBut more immediately is the Masters, to which Poulter will go after returning to his Orlando, Florida home for a brief reunion with his family. \n“I need to unpack, have some chocolate with the kids tonight and repack for Augusta,” he said. \nCHEST-BEATING PUTT Apr 1, 2018; Humble, TX, USA; Ian Poulter of England arrives at the second tee during final round of the Houston Open golf tournament at Golf Club of Houston - The Tournament Course. Mandatory Credit: John Glaser-USA TODAY Sports \nThe stars aligned for Poulter at the final hole in regulation play on Sunday, when Hossler grazed the hole with a birdie attempt that would have clinched victory. \n“He thought he had holed it. I thought he holed it,” said Poulter, whose 20-foot birdie putt was on a similar line. \nUsing the same putter he wielded so effectively to lead Europe to victory in the 2012 Ryder Cup, he came through in the clutch yet again to force the playoff. \n“I hit a great putt, good read and it obviously was very helpful seeing his putt,” Poulter added. \nHe punched his chest with his right fist five times in excitement after matching Hossler’s 67 after the pair tied at 19-under-par 269, three shots clear of Jordan Spieth and Emiliano Grillo. \nHossler then handed Poulter the tournament at the first extra hole, the par-four 18th, where the American hit his third shot from a greenside bunker into a water hazard. \nPoulter’s third victory on the PGA Tour followed previous wins at World Golf Championships events — the 2010 Match Play and the 2012 HSBC Champions in Shenzhen. \nHis chances of winning looked remote after he shot 73 on Thursday but rounds of 64, 65, 67 followed after he flicked what he described as a “mental switch”. \n“Last week was painful,” Poulter said. “To come here this week, I was tired, frustrated on Thursday. I didn’t play my best stuff. I packed my bags to leave on Friday.” Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Nick Mulvenney/John O'Brien",
