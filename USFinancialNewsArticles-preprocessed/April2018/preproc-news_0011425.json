    "text": "Defenseman Shea Theodore collected the only goal of the shootout, scoring in the fourth round, to give the visiting Vegas Golden Knights a 5-4 victory over Vancouver Canucks on Tuesday night at Rogers Arena.\nTheodore beat Jacob Markstrom with a backhand over the goalie’s glove side as the Golden Knights improved to 4-0 in shootouts. Malcolm Subban, who made 21 saves through regulation and overtime, stopped all four Vancouver attempts to improve to a perfect 13-for-13 this season in stopping shootout attempts.\nBrandon Pirri scored two goals, William Karlsson had a goal and two assists and Tomas Tatar also scored a goal for Vegas, which remains four points behind the Nashville Predators for the top record in the Western Conference. The Golden Knights, who blew a 4-1 lead in the third period, were playing their first game since clinching the Pacific Division with a 3-2 win over the San Jose Sharks on Saturday.\nVegas rested starting goalie Marc-Andre Fleury as well as four of its five leading scorers, center Jonathan Marchessault (75 points), left winger David Perron (66), right winger Reilly Smith (60) and left winger Erik Haula (55) in preparation for next week’s Stanley Cup playoffs.\nNikolay Goldobin scored two goals, Brandon Sutter had a goal and an assist, and Bo Horvat also scored for Vancouver. Markstrom finished with 35 saves.\nPirri, who didn’t arrive to the team hotel until 1:30 p.m. Tuesday after being recalled from AHL Chicago, where he had 29 goals, scored on his first shot as a Golden Knight. His wrist shot from the slot beat Markstrom high on the glove side at the 4:28 mark of the first period.\nVancouver tied it with just 21 seconds to go in the opening period when Goldobin, off a nice drop pass by Sutter, fired a quick wrist shot past Subban’s blocker for his seventh goal of the season.\nPirri put the Golden Knights back in front early in the second period with a one-timer from the right circle off a crossing pass from Alex Tuch for his 100th career point. Tatar made it 3-1 four minutes later with his 20th goal of the season when Shea Theodore’s shot from the left point deflected in off his right shin pad.\nKarlsson increased the Vegas lead to 4-1 with his 43rd goal of the season on a five-on-three power play at the 2:17 mark of the third period, but Vancouver rallied to tie it with goals by Horvat, Sutter and Goldobin in a span of less than seven minutes.\nTatar appeared to win it at 2:56 in overtime with a power-play shot that trickled past Markstrom, but the score was waived off immediately for goalie interference by Pirri, who hit Markstrom after a check by Troy Stecher. Vegas unsuccessfully challenged the call.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
