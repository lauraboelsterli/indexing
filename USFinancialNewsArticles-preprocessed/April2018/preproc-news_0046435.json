    "text": "OMAHA, Neb.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- AMCON Distributing Company (“AMCON”) (NYSE American:DIT), an Omaha, Nebraska based consumer products company is pleased to announce fully diluted earnings per share of $0.49 on net income available to common shareholders of $0.3 million for our second fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018.\n“We operate in a highly competitive environment in both our business segments. AMCON will continue to initiate the operating investments necessary to support our customers and enhance our leadership position in the Convenience Distribution Industry. Foodservice expertise is a critical part of the future of our industry and our commitment to this category remains at the forefront of our business strategy. In addition, we seek to develop proprietary technology capabilities as the needs of our customers grow in complexity. This approach has served to differentiate us from our competition,” said Christopher H. Atayan, AMCON’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. He further noted, “We are actively seeking acquisitions that can benefit from our extensive platform of customer service. We are also looking carefully at a number of geographic growth opportunities as our customer base expands.”\n“Our annual spring trade show in Kansas City was well received by our customers and vendors. This event provides momentum as we enter our customers’ peak selling season,” said Kathleen M. Evans, President of AMCON’s Wholesale Distribution segment. She further noted, “We are making the logistics and related technology investments necessary to support our customers’ geographic growth.”\n“We are pleased with the progress of our new store in Lakeland, Florida. Our management team is developing market driven enhancements to our core business model in order for us to compete in this highly challenging retail environment. We will continue to invest heavily in new stores and store upgrades as that is necessary for us to remain a viable competitor in the market place,” said Clifford Ginn, President of AMCON’s Retail Health Food Segment.\n“We actively manage our working capital and liquidity which provides an ability to respond quickly to the dynamic environments in which both of our business segments operate. This conservative approach provides us significant flexibility to act in the long term best interest of the many constituencies we serve. Both of our business segments are utilizing significant financial resources in the course of making the investments necessary for long term competitive success,” said Andrew C. Plummer, AMCON’s Chief Financial Officer. “We were pleased to close the March 31, 2018 quarter with shareholders’ equity of $70.1 million and consolidated debt of $33.4 million.”\nAMCON is a leading wholesale distributor of consumer products, including beverages, candy, tobacco, groceries, foodservice, frozen and chilled foods, and health and beauty care products with locations in Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Tennessee. AMCON also operates sixteen (16) health and natural product retail stores in the Midwest and Florida. The retail stores operate under the names Chamberlin's Market & Cafe www.chamberlins.com and Akin’s Natural Foods Market www.akins.com .\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and which reflect management's current beliefs and estimates of future economic circumstances, industry conditions, Company performance and financial results.
