    "text": "First Quarter 2018 Financial Highlights:\nNet income of $4.2 million, or $0.44 per diluted share. Return on average equity of 14.40% and return on average assets of 1.61%. Solid net interest margin of 4.15% driven by a loan yield of 5.87%. New loan production of $103.5 million.\nLOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- CBB Bancorp, Inc. (“CBB” or the “Company”) (OTCQB: CBBI), the parent company of Commonwealth Business Bank (the “Bank”), today announced net income of $4.2 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $1.0 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for the prior quarter and $3.6 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017. The prior quarter’s net income and earnings per diluted share were adversely impacted by a $2.0 million write down of the Company’s net deferred asset that was required when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Excluding the impact of the write down of the Company’s net deferred tax asset, net income for the prior quarter would have been $3.0 million, or $0.32 per diluted share.\n“In the first quarter our earnings were positively impacted by the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate to 21% and our consistently strong net interest margin. Even though recent investments in our infrastructure have increased our operating costs, we believe these investments will provide lasting, long-term benefits to the Company,” said Joanne Kim, President and CEO. “In the first quarter, we hired a second SBA lending specialist in the state of Washington to expand our presence in this attractive SBA market,” Ms. Kim added.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31, % March 31, % 2018 2017 Change 2017 Change (Dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) Net income $ 4,154 $ 1,013 310.1 % $ 3,559 16.7 % Diluted EPS $ 0.44 $ 0.11 300.0 % $ 0.38 15.8 % Return on average assets 1.61 % 0.39 % 312.8 % 1.60 % 0.6 % Return on average equity 14.40 % 3.46 % 316.2 % 13.85 % 4.0 % Noninterest income/average assets 1.27 % 1.11 % 14.4 % 1.40 % (9.3 %) Pre-tax, pre-provision earnings/average assets 2.32 % 1.96 % 18.4 % 2.69 % (13.8 %) Noninterest expense/average assets 2.96 % 3.04 % (2.6 %) 2.67 % 10.9 % Efficiency ratio 56.09 % 60.76 % (7.7 %) 49.79 % 12.7 % Net interest margin¹ 4.15 % 4.06 % 2.2 % 4.14 % 0.2 % ¹ Amounts calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis using the current statutory federal tax rate Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income was $10.4 million for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $171,000, or 1.7%, compared to $10.2 million for the prior quarter, and an increase of $1.6 million, or 17.6%, compared to $8.8 million for the same quarter last year. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to a $220,000 increase in interest earned on loans and a $155,000 increase in interest earned on investments securities, which were partially offset by a $133,000 increase in interest paid on deposits and a $50,000 increase in interest paid on borrowings. The quarter-over-quarter increase in interest earned on loans was primarily due to a $9.0 million increase in the average balance of loans, including loans held-for-sale, to $814.6 million from $805.6 million for the prior quarter, combined with a 17 basis point increase in the yield on loans to 5.87% from 5.70% in the prior quarter. The year-over-year quarterly increase was primarily due to a $2.0 million increase in interest earned on loans, a $316,000 increase in interest earned on investment securities and a $187,000 increase in interest earned on deposits at the FRB and other banks, which were partially offset by a $874,000 increase in interest paid on deposits and a $69,000 increase in interest paid on borrowings. The year-over-year quarterly increase in interest earned on loans was primarily due to a $69.4 million increase in the average balance of loans, combined with a 54 basis point increase in the yield on loans from 5.33% in the same quarter last year.\nThe reported yield on our loan portfolio is impacted by a number of factors, including changes in the average contractual interest rate earned on the portfolio and the amount of discount accretion on SBA loans. The following table reconciles the contractual yield on our loan portfolio to the reported yield for the periods indicated.\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 March 31, 2017 Amount Yield Amount Yield Amount Yield (Dollars in thousands) Contractual yield $ 10,825 5.39 % $ 10,717 5.28 % $ 9,159 4.98 % SBA discount accretion 1,106 0.55 % 850 0.42 % 688 0.37 % Prepayment penalties & late fees 23 0.01 % 82 0.04 % 77 0.05 % Amortization of net deferred costs (167 ) (0.08 %) (82 ) (0.04 %) (137 ) (0.07 %) Interest recognized on nonaccrual loans - - - - - - As reported yield on loans $ 11,787 5.87 % $ 11,567 5.70 % $ 9,787 5.33 % The net interest margin was 4.15% for the current quarter, an increase of 9 basis points, from 4.06% in the prior quarter and an increase of 1 basis point from 4.14% in the year ago quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily due to a 17 basis point increase in the yield on interest-earning assets to 5.13% from 4.96% in the prior quarter, which was partially offset by 10 basis points increase in our cost of funds to 1.09% from 0.99% in the prior quarter. The year-over-year quarterly increase was primarily due to a 28 basis point increase in the yield on interest-earning assets from 4.85% in the year ago quarter, which was partially offset by a 31 basis point increase in our cost of funds from 0.78% in the same period last year. The quarter-over-quarter increase in our cost of funds was primarily due to a 9 basis point increase in our cost of deposits to 1.07% in the current quarter from 0.98% in the prior quarter and the year-over-year quarterly increase in our cost of funds was primarily due to a 30 basis point increase in our cost of deposits from 0.77% in the same quarter last year. The increase in the contractual yield on our loans and cost of funds in the current quarter compared to the year ago quarter was primarily due to increases in short-term market interest rates, with the overnight federal funds rate increasing 75 basis points during this twelve-month period.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nThe CBB recorded no provision for loan losses in the current, prior and year ago quarters.\nNoninterest Income\nFor the current quarter, noninterest income totaled $3.3 million, an increase of $380,000, or 13.0%, and an increase of $186,000, or 6.0%, from $2.9 million and $3.1 million in the prior and year ago quarters, respectively. The quarter-over-quarter increase was primarily driven by a $577,000 increase in gains on sales of loans, which was partially offset by a $153,000 decrease in SBA loan servicing fee income. The quarter-over-quarter increase in gains on sales of loans was primarily due to an increase in the amount of SBA loans we sold, while the quarter-over-quarter decrease in SBA loan servicing fee income was due to an increase in the amount of SBA loans paid off during the current quarter. The year-over-year quarterly increase was primarily due to a $458,000 increase in gains on sales of loans, which was partially offset by a $122,000 decrease in SBA loan servicing fee income, a $100,000 decrease in other income and a $103,000 decrease in gains on sales of other real estate owned (“OREO”). The year-over-year quarterly increase in gains on sales of SBA loans was primarily due to an increase in the amount of SBA loans we sold.\nAs the following table indicates, during the first quarter of 2018, the Company sold $34.9 million of SBA loans, compared to $22.6 million in the preceding quarter and $27.8 million in the same quarter last year. The quarterly average premium on sales of SBA loans for the current quarter was 9.71%, compared to 10.41% in the prior quarter and 9.24% in the year ago quarter. The amount of SBA loans we sell varies based on the volume of loans we originate, our liquidity needs and market conditions.\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31, % March 31, % 2018 2017 Change 2017 Change (Dollars in thousands) SBA loans held-for-sale at beginning of the quarter $ 28,346 $ 18,626 52.2 % $ 18,096 56.6 % SBA loans originated/transferred from held-for-investment during the quarter\n30,377 32,447 (6.4 %) 43,019 (29.4 %) SBA loans sold during the quarter (34,923 ) (22,618 ) 54.4 % (27,774 ) 25.7 % SBA loans principal payment, net of advance (192 ) (109 ) 76.1 % (88 ) 118.2 % SBA loans held-for-sale at end of the quarter $ 23,608 $ 28,346 (16.7 %) $ 33,253 (29.0 %) Gain on sale of SBA loans $ 2,436 $ 1,852 31.5 % $ 1,978 23.2 % Premium on sale (weighted average) 9.71 % 10.41 % (6.7 %) 9.24 % 5.1 % SBA loan production $ 35,681 $ 54,496 (34.5 %) $ 57,579 (38.0 %) Noninterest Expense\nNoninterest expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $7.7 million, a decrease of $303,000, or 3.8%, from $8.0 million in the prior quarter and an increase of $1.7 million, or 29.1%, from $5.9 million in the year ago quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to a $203,000 decrease in salaries and employee benefits, a $20,000 decrease in occupancy and equipment related expense, a $49,000 decrease in professional expense, and a $53,000 decrease in other expense, which were offset by an $86,000 increase in marketing expense. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in salaries and employee benefits was primarily driven by a decrease in incentive compensation during the quarter and the quarter-over-quarter decrease in professional expense was primarily due to a decrease in legal fees related to the formation of the bank holding company in 2017. The year-over-year quarterly increase was primarily due to a $723,000 increase in salaries and employee benefits, a $268,000 increase in occupancy and equipment related expense, and a $323,000 increase in professional expense. The year-over-year quarterly increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to a 20 person increase in the average number of FTEs to 164 from 144 during the year ago quarter, combined with annual employee merit increases and an increase in employee incentive expense. The increase in occupancy and equipment related expense was due to the opening of three new branches during the current year. The increase in professional expense was attributable to a $107,000 increase in legal fees and a $179,000 increase in external and internal audit fees related to having its audited financial statements meet public reporting standards and making the Company FDICIA compliant.\nAt or for the Three Months Ended March 31, December 31, % March 31, % 2018 2017 Change 2017 Change (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and benefits $ 4,738 $ 4,941 (4.1 %) $ 4,015 18.0 % FTE at the end of period 164 161 1.9 % 147 11.6 % Average FTE during the period 164 162 1.2 % 144 13.9 % Salaries and benefit/average FTE¹ $ 117 $ 121 (3.3 %) $ 113 3.5 % Salaries and benefit/average assets¹ 1.83 % 1.89 % (3.2 %) 1.81 % 1.1 % Noninterest expense/average assets¹ 2.96 % 3.04 % (2.6 %) 2.67 % 10.9 % ¹Annualized\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense was $1.8 million for the quarter, or an effective tax rate of 30.70%, compared to $4.1 million, or an effective tax rate of 80.29%, for the prior quarter and $2.4 million, or an effective tax rate of 40.50%, for the year ago quarter. The quarter-over-quarter decrease in income tax expense, and related effective tax rate, was due to the aforementioned $2.0 million write down of the Company’s net deferred tax asset in the prior quarter and the permanent reduction in the federal corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% effective January 1, 2018. In the current quarter, the Company’s net deferred tax asset was written down by an additional $86,000 due to changes in certain assumptions we made at the end of 2017 in calculating the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The year-over-year quarterly decrease in income tax expense, and the related effective tax rate, was due the aforementioned reduction in the federal corporate tax rate, which was partially offset by the $86,000 write down of the Company’s net deferred tax asset.\nPre-Tax, Pre-Provision Income\nFor the first quarter of 2018, the Company’s pre-tax, pre-provision (“PTPP”) income was $6.0 million, an increase of $854,000, or 16.6%, from $5.1 million for the prior quarter and an increase of $12,000, or 0.2%, from $6.0 million for the same quarter last year. The quarter-over-quarter increase in PTPP income was primarily due to increases in net interest income and gains on sales of loans combined with a decrease in noninterest expense. The year-over-year quarterly increase in PTPP income was primarily driven by increases in net interest income and gains on sales of loans, which were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. Annualized PTPP income to average assets increased to 2.32% for the current quarter, compared to 1.96% for the prior quarter, but decreased compared to 2.69% for the year ago quarter. The quarter-over-quarter increase in PTPP income to average assets was primarily attributable to a higher proportional increase in PTPP income than average assets and the year-over-year quarterly decrease in PTPP income to average assets was primarily due to a higher proportional increase in average assets than PTPP income.\nThree Months Ended March 31, December 31, % March 31, % 2018 2017 Change 2017 Change (Dollars in thousands) PTPP income $ 5,994 $ 5,140 16.6 % $ 5,982 0.2 % Average assets $ 1,049,295 $ 1,038,577 1.0 % $ 901,145 16.4 % Annualized PTPP/average assets 2.32 % 1.96 % 18.4 % 2.69 % (13.8 %) PTPP, excluding gain on sale of SBA loans $ 3,558 $ 3,281 8.4 % $ 4,004 (11.1 %) BALANCE SHEET\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had total assets of $1.07 billion, a decrease of $8.5 million, or 0.8%, from $1.08 billion at December 31, 2017 and an increase of $148.4 million, or 16.1%, from $922.0 million at March 31, 2017.

The quarter-over-quarter decrease in interest-earning deposits at the FRB and other banks was primarily due to a decrease in FHLB advances to $10.0 million from $60.0 million in the prior quarter combined with an increase in loans receivable during the current quarter. The year-over-year quarterly increase in interest-earning deposits at the FRB and other banks was primarily driven by an increase in deposits, which was partially offset by an increase in loans receivable.\nInvestment Securities\nInvestment securities totaled $117.6 million at the current quarter-end, a decrease of $6.0 million, or 4.9%, compared to $123.7 million at the end of the prior quarter, and an increase of $44.2 million, or 60.2%, compared to $73.4 million at the end of the year ago quarter. The year-over-year increase in investment securities was due to investing the Company’s excess liquidity into higher yielding investment securities.\nLoans Receivable\nThe following table details loans by type at the dates indicated:\nMarch 31,\nDecember 31,\n$\n%\nMarch 31,\n$\n%\n2018 2017 Change Change 2017\nChange Change (Dollars in thousands) Construction $ 9,032 $ 12,575 $ (3,543 ) (28.2 %) $ 12,302 $ (3,270 ) (26.6 %) Commercial real estate 668,649 645,211 23,438 3.6 % 581,697 86,952 14.9 % Commercial and industrial 126,057 122,917 3,140 2.6 % 126,204 (147 ) (0.1 %) Consumer 3,952 4,928 (976 ) (19.8 %) 2,845 1,107 38.9 % Gross loans\n807,690 785,631 22,059 2.8 % 723,049 84,641 11.7 % Net deferred loan fees/costs 1,591 1,768 (176 ) (10.0 %) 1,737 (146 ) (8.4 %) Loans receivable $ 809,281 $ 787,399 $ 21,882 2.8 % $ 724,786 $ 84,495 11.7 % Loans held-for-sale $ 23,608 $ 28,346 $ (4,738 ) (16.7 %) $ 33,253 $ (9,645 ) (29.0 %) Loans receivable including loans held-for-sale $ 832,889 $ 815,745 $ 17,144 2.1 % $ 758,039 $ 74,850 9.9 % Loan-to-deposit (LTD) ratio 86.9 % 87.9 % (1.0 %) (1.1 %) 90.6 % (3.7 %) (4.1 %) LTD ratio including loans held-for-sale 89.4 % 91.1 % (1.6 %) (1.8 %) 94.8 % (5.3 %) (5.6 %) At March 31, 2018, loans receivable, including loans held-for-sale, were $832.9 million, an increase of $17.1 million, or 2.1%, from $815.7 million at December 31, 2017, and an increase of $74.9 million, or 9.9%, from $758.0 million at March 31, 2017.

The quarter-over-quarter increase in loans 30 to 89 days past due was primarily due to late payments on loans which were received in April 2018. There were no loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing at the end of the current, prior, and year ago quarters. Nonaccrual loans decreased $362,000 to $2.1 million, or 0.26% of loans receivable at the end of the current quarter from $2.5 million, or 0.31% of loans receivable at the end of the prior quarter, and decreased $1.1 million from $3.2 million, or 0.44% of loans receivable, at the end of the year ago quarter.\nNonperforming loans at March 31, 2018 were $2.1 million, or 0.26% of loans receivable, a decrease of $362,000, compared to $2.5 million, or 0.31% of loans receivable, at the end of the prior quarter and a decrease of $1.1 million from $3.2 million, or 0.44% of loans receivable, at the end of the same quarter last year.\nThe Company did not have any OREO at the end of the current, prior, and the year ago quarters.\nNonperforming assets at the end of current quarter were $2.1 million, or 0.20% of total assets, a decrease of $362,000, compared to $2.5 million, or 0. 23% of total assets, at December 31, 2017, and a decrease of $1.1 million from $3.2 million, or 0.34% of total assets, at March 31, 2017. The year-over-year quarterly decrease in nonperforming assets was primarily due to one loan relationship totaling $716,000 that became current during the second quarter of 2017.\nClassified loans at the end of the current quarter were $12.1 million, or 1.50% of loans receivable, an increase of $2.0 million, or 19.8%, compared to $10.1 million, or 1.28% of loans receivable, at the end of the prior quarter, and an increase of $4.0 million, or 49.4%, compared to $8.1 million, or 1.12% of loans receivable, at the end of the same quarter last year. The quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases were primarily due to the downgrade of loans to borrowers who have experienced deteriorated business performance. These loans continue to perform as agreed.\nThe allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2018 was $8.6 million, or 1.06% of loans receivable, compared to $8.7 million, or 1.10% of loans receivable, at December 31, 2017, and $8.4 million, or 1.16%, of loans receivable, at the end of the year ago quarter. The allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was 406.46%, 350.75%, and 265.96% at March 31, 2018, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2017, respectively.\nCAPITAL\nAt March 31, 2018, CBB and the Bank continued to exceed all minimum regulatory capital requirements and they maintained capital conservation buffers in excess of the minimum required to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, and certain discretionary bonus payments. The minimum capital conservation buffer requirement was 1.875% and 1.250% in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The capital conservation buffer is calculated as the smallest excess of a bank holding company’s and a bank’s common equity tier 1, tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios over the regulatory “adequately” capitalized minimum ratios of 4.50%, 6.00% and 8.00%, respectively. The minimum capital conservation buffer will increase an additional 0.625% at the beginning of 2019, reaching the fully phased-in minimum of 2.500%. As a result, effective January 1, 2019 bank holding companies and banks will be required to maintain common equity tier 1, tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios that are at least 7.00%, 8.50%, and 10.50%, respectively, to avoid the aforementioned limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.
