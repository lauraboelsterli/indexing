    "text": "Source: Analog Devices \nA disappointing forecast from a key Apple chip partner drove shares of iPhone suppliers lower. \nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing said Thursday that its revenue forecast range for the second quarter is $7.8 billion to $7.9 billion versus the Wall Street estimate of $8.8 billion. \n\"Moving into second quarter 2018, continued weak demand from our mobile sector will negatively impact our business,\" the company's chief financial officer, Lora Ho, said in a statement. \nTSMC is the world's largest semiconductor foundry company and manufactures chips for Apple and its component suppliers. \nMorgan Stanley said Apple's iPhone was a big reason for TSMC's poor guidance. \n\"Smartphone semi weakness [is] the main reason for the revenue shortfall,\" analyst Charlie Chan wrote in a note to clients Thursday. \"Beside the order cuts from the current Apple iPhone X processor, we attribute the major revenue shortfall in the smartphone segment to key customer MediaTek ... and around a month's delay of Apple's new 7nm processor to July.\" \nAs a result, the stock prices of Apple suppliers dropped Thursday. Skyworks Solutions , Qualcomm , Cirrus Logic , Qorvo and Analog Devices shares all declined more than 3 percent. \nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
