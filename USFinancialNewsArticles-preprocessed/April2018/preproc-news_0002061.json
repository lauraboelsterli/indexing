    "text": "DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- American Realty Investors, Inc. (NYSE: ARL), a Dallas-based real estate investment company is reporting its continued growth in both revenue and net operating income for 2017. Revenue increased to $126.2 million as compared to $119.7 million in 2016, while net income increased to $17.4 million for 2017 compared to $14.6 million for 2016. Further, the Company is continuing its growth strategy into the future with fourteen additional apartment projects in various stages of development. As these new projects come to completion, our strategic model of focusing on our multifamily portfolio for the future growth of the Company will continue. We are track and well positioned operationally and strategically for the opportunities ahead.\nManagement will continue its plan for growth from its operating properties and expects to reinvest in areas that will complement this growth; further management will maintain strong attention to all details of its operations including appropriate expense controls.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, we reported a net loss applicable to common shares of $9.5 million or ($0.61) per diluted earnings per share compared to a net loss applicable to common shares of $3.8 million or ($0.25) per diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2016. During 2016 and 2017, a subsidiary of the Company raised $115 million through the sale of bonds, which are traded on the Israeli stock exchange. In 2017, ARL recorded a non-cash foreign currency loss of $4.6 million.\nRevenues\nRental and other property revenues were $126.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This represents an increase of $6.5 million compared to the prior year revenues of $119.7 million. The change by segment is an increase in the apartment portfolio of $6.2 million and an increase in the commercial portfolio of 0.3 million, partially offset by a decrease of $0.1 million in the other portfolio. We purchased four apartment communities during the year ended December 31, 2016, which produced rental revenue of $8.3 million and $2.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for a net increase of $6.3 million. In addition, we purchased one apartment property during 2017 that produced $0.8 million in rental revenue.\nExpenses\nProperty operating expenses were $64.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This represents an increase of $1.1 million compared to the prior year operating expenses of $63.0 million. The change by segment is an increase in the apartment portfolio of $2.9 million, a decrease in the commercial portfolio of $1.9 million and a decrease in the land portfolio of $0.9 million, partially offset by an increase in the other portfolio of $1.0 million. The Company added a net 723 apartment units during 2016 and 201 units during 2017. Property operating expenses for our commercial portfolio decreased $1.8 million. In addition, we had a decrease in property operating expenses for our land portfolio of $1.0 million.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses were $25.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This represents an increase of $1.9 million compared to prior year depreciation of $23.8 million. The increase is primarily due to the growth in our apartment portfolio, which had an increase of $2.3 million year-over-year.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $7.7 million dollars for the year ended December 31, 2017. This represents an increase of $0.6 million compared to the prior year general and administrative expenses of $7.1 million.\nThere was no provision for impairment of notes receivable, investment in real estate partnerships and real estate assets for the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.\nNet income fee was $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The net income fee paid to Pillar is calculated at 7.5% of net income.\nAdvisory fees were $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This represents an increase of $0.2 million compared to the prior year advisory fees of $10.9 million. Advisory fees are computed based on a gross asset fee of 0.0625% per month (0.75% per annum) of the average of the gross asset value.\nOther income (expense)\nInterest income was $18.9 million for the year ending December 31, 2017. This represents a decrease of $1.6 million compared to the prior year interest income of $20.5 million dollars. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $2.3 in interest on notes receivable, partially offset by a $1.3 million increase in interest on receivable owed from Advisor.\nOther income was $4.1 million for the year ending December 31, 2017. This represents an increase of $2.0 million compared to prior year other income of $2.1 million. The increase is primarily due to a property with a negotiated settlement of a debt with the lender during 2015.\nMortgage and loan interest expense was $66.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This represents an increase of $6.7 million compared to the prior year expense of $59.4 million. The change by segment is an increase in the other portfolio of $7.4 million, an increase in the apartment portfolio of $1.7 million and an increase in the commercial portfolio of $0.3 million, partially offset by a decrease in the land portfolio of $2.5 million. The increase in the apartment portfolio was primarily due to the acquisition of new properties, partially offset by the refinancing of five loans during 2016 at lower rates.\nGain on sale of income-producing properties was $16.7 million and $16.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively. Included in the 2017 gain is $9.8 million which recognition of a deferred gain from a property sale in a prior year.
