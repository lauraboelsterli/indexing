    "text": "HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. (NYSE: PAA ) and Plains GP Holdings (NYSE: PAGP ) today announced their quarterly distributions with respect to the first quarter of 2018.\nPAA announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.30 per common unit ($1.20 per unit on an annualized basis), which is unchanged from the distribution paid in February 2018. PAGP announced a corresponding quarterly cash distribution of $0.30 per Class A share ($1.20 per Class A share on an annualized basis), which is unchanged from the distribution paid in February 2018. With respect to PAA’s Series A Preferred Units, PAA announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.525 per Series A Preferred Unit, or $2.10 on an annualized basis. For its Series B Preferred Units, PAA announced a semi-annual distribution of $30.625 per Series B Preferred Unit.
