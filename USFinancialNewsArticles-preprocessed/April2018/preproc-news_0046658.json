Originally, it could have seen the firm’s top management, including Chief Executive Jeff Fairburn, make a profit of more than 200 million pounds on share options.\nThe company will be holding an annual general meeting later on Wednesday, where shareholders will vote on remuneration for senior bosses.\n$1 = 0.7161 pounds Reporting by Radhika Rukmangadhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Jason Neely and Mark Potter\n ",
