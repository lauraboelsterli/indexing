    "text": "3 COMMENTS John F. Kennedy International Airport will impose new requirements on airlines and terminal operators to prevent a repeat of the days of delays and confusion endured by passengers following a January snowstorm.\nWhen the next storm hits JFK, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the airport, says it will require airlines to get permission to land at JFK before planes depart from their origin airport. Port Authority Executive Director Rick Cotton said the rule, as well as other new measures, will kick in only when the airport declares a storm emergency.\nThe measures result from a series of meetings with airport groups such as terminal operators and airlines aimed at avoiding another breakdown like the one that occurred over several days beginning Jan. 4. “The ‘no action’ option was off the table,” Mr. Cotton said.\nThe International Air Transport Association, a trade group, declined to comment on whether it supported all of the new procedures. A spokesman said: “We look forward to working with the Port Authority and all stakeholders to collaboratively develop procedures based on industry best practices and expertise that will enhance the customer experience going forward.”\nJFK, which handles nearly 60 million passengers a year, had trouble coping with an influx of international flights following the January storm.\nSome long-haul flights took off before the Port Authority realized it couldn’t open JFK because of the snow. Most diverted to other U.S. airports, setting up days of confusion as some terminals, which often run at or near capacity on a normal day, were overwhelmed with arriving flights.\nSome aircraft landed at JFK even though there weren’t enough gates to handle the arrivals. And some terminals struggled to operate a regular schedule while they were backed up with empty aircraft from previous days taking up gate space.\nAs a result, passengers were stranded on planes for hours in remote sections of the airfield waiting for buses to retrieve them. When they made it to the terminals they were separated from their luggage, in some cases waiting days to be reunited with bags.\nThe airport’s six terminals, each run by different airlines or private operators, didn’t coordinate during the storm.\nThe new Port Authority measures require terminals to share equipment, staff and gates. It also forces airlines to provide a baggage service in their arrivals terminal.\nTerminal One, which is operated by a consortium of four airlines, serves 21 carriers. Yet, only six of those airlines have dedicated baggage services, said Steve Rowland, executive director of Terminal One Group, the terminal’s operator.\nThe terminal opened a communal baggage service in March that offers electronic luggage tracking and communications with passengers, he said. A handful of airlines already have signed up, Mr. Rowland noted, and he expects more to follow shortly. “That’s a great win for passengers,” he added.\nMr. Cotton said all airlines would be forced to comply with the new protocols. The measures are intended to supplement those put in place by the Port Authority in the wake of the January storm. Chief among them was the establishment of an expanded emergency-operations center that brings together the Port Authority, airlines, terminal operators, and airport-service providers.\nThe Port Authority is awaiting the results of an investigation it commissioned into the storm breakdown by former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. The report is expected in May.\nWrite to Paul Berger at Paul.Berger@wsj.com",
