    "text": "BEIJING, April 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- iQIYI, Inc. (NASDAQ:IQ) (\"iQIYI\" or the \"Company\"), an innovative market-leading online entertainment service in China, today announced its unaudited financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Highlights\nTotal revenues were RMB4.9 billion (US$777.6 million), representing a 57% 1 increase from the same period in 2017. Operating loss was RMB1.1 billion (US$169.4 million) and operating loss margin was 22%, compared to operating loss of RMB1.0 billion and operating loss margin of 34% in the same period in 2017. Net loss attributable to iQIYI was RMB395.7 million (US$63.1 million), compared to RMB1.1 billion in the same period in 2017. Fully diluted net loss per ordinary share was RMB1.97 (US$0.31), compared to RMB5.37 in the same period in 2017.\n“We are pleased to report a set of solid results for the first quarter of 2018,” commented Dr. Yu Gong, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of iQIYI. “Both of our major business pillars, advertising services and membership services, generated significant growth driven by our premium content, especially a series of successful self-produced variety shows launched during the quarter. Our recent IPO positions us well for the exciting future ahead as iQIYI now enjoys higher brand recognition with increasingly more partners and artists around the world seeking to collaborate with us. Going forward, we will continue to strategically allocate our resources and bandwidth to original content production and technology innovation as we aspire to become a technology-based entertainment giant.”\n“Our strong first quarter performance was marked by a 57% year-over-year growth in total revenues, and better-than-expected improvement on our bottom line,” commented Xiaodong Wang, Chief Financial Officer of iQIYI. “The financial results reflect enhanced monetization and operating efficiency across our various business lines during the quarter. With the capital raised via our IPO, we are more confident than ever to capture the tremendous opportunities in the fast-growing entertainment industry and deliver long-term value to our shareholders. ”\nFootnote:\n[1] Starting from January 1, 2018, iQIYI adopted a new revenue accounting standard (ASC 606), which reclassifies value added tax from the cost of revenues to net against revenues. To increase comparability of operating results and help investors better understand our business performance and operating trends, 2017 net revenues have been used to calculate all percentage changes in revenues and operating loss margins. 2017 net revenues are defined as gross revenues under legacy GAAP after the deduction of value added-taxes, which is presented on the same basis as 2018 and going forward.\nFirst Quarter 2018 Financial Results\nTotal revenues reached RMB4.9 billion (US$777.6 million), representing a 57% increase from the same period in 2017.\nMembership services revenue was RMB2.1 billion (US$334.0 million), representing a 67% increase from the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by a series of premium original content titles released in the first quarter of 2018 as well as various initiatives we rolled out during the Chinese New Year holiday.\nOnline advertising services revenue was RMB2.1 billion (US$336.5 million), representing a 52% increase from the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to our improved efficiency in the monetization of brand advertising business, driven by our strong and expanding library of self-produced content, as well as the robust growth of our in-feed advertising business.\nContent distribution revenue was RMB266.7 million (US$42.5 million), representing a 44% increase from the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to several major drama series titles that we sub-licensed to external partners in the first quarter of 2018.\nOther revenues were RMB405.0 million (US$64.6 million), representing a 51% increase from the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by strong performance across various other business lines in the first quarter of 2018.\nCost of revenues was RMB4.8 billion (US$772.9 million), representing a 44% increase from RMB3.4 billion after deducting the value added tax in the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily driven by content costs due to higher amortization of licensed copyrights and produced content, which was in turn caused by our increased investment in content offerings. Content costs as a component of cost of revenues were RMB3.9 billion (US$617.0 million), representing a 54% increase from the same period in 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were RMB704.2 million (US$112.3 million), representing a 42% increase from the same period in 2017. The increase was primarily due to increased channel and marketing expenses associated with the pre-installation of iQIYI’s app, as well as brand and content promotional expenses.\nResearch and development expenses were RMB387.3 million (US$61.7 million), representing a 44% increase from the same period in 2017, primarily due to increased headcount in research and development.\nOperating loss was RMB1.1 billion (US$169.4 million), compared to operating loss of RMB1.0 billion in the same period in 2017. Operating loss margin was 22%, compared to operating loss margin of 34% in the same period in 2017.\nTotal other income was RMB666.2 million (US$106.2 million), compared to total other expenses of RMB79.1 million during the same period of 2017. In the first quarter of 2018, we recognized RMB186.6 million (US$29.7 million) of fair value gain arising from one of our private company investments in accordance with the new financial instruments accounting standard adopted on January 1, 2018 and RMB474.2 million (US$75.6 million) of foreign exchange gain arising from the appreciation of the Renminbi against the U.S. dollar.\nLoss before income taxes was RMB396.2 million (US$63.2 million), compared to RMB1.1 billion in the same period in 2017.\nIncome tax expenses were RMB0.5 million (US$0.1 million), compared to income tax expense of RMB0.8 million in the same period in 2017.\nNet loss attributable to iQIYI was RMB395.7 million (US$63.1 million), compared to RMB1.1 billion in the same period in 2017. Fully diluted net loss per ordinary share was RMB1.97 (US$0.31), compared to RMB5.37 in the same period in 2017.\nAs of March 31, 2018, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of RMB896.1 million (US$142.9 million).\nRecent Developments\nOn March 29, 2018, the Company had an initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 125,000,000 American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”), each representing seven Class A ordinary shares of the Company, on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The Company expects to receive a total of approximately US$2.36 billion of net proceeds from the IPO and the underwriters' partial exercise of their option to purchase additional ADSs, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company. Upon completion of the IPO, all outstanding preferred shares and ordinary shares held by Baidu Holdings Limited were automatically re-designated and converted into Class B ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis into 2,839,530,705 Class B ordinary shares, all preferred shares and ordinary shares other than those held by Baidu Holdings Limited were automatically re-designated and converted into Class A ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis into 1,231,841,032 Class A ordinary shares. Each Class A ordinary share is entitled to one vote, and each Class B ordinary share is entitled to ten votes and is convertible into one Class A ordinary share at any time. Class A ordinary shares cannot be converted into Class B ordinary shares.\nOn April 12, 2018, the Company completed issuance of 36,860,691 Class B ordinary shares to Baidu Holdings Limited pursuant to a share purchase agreement entered into between the Company and Baidu Holdings Limited on February 12, 2018.\nFinancial Guidance\nFor the second quarter of 2018, iQIYI expects total net revenues to be between RMB5.80 billion (US$924.0 million) and RMB6.04 billion (US$963.1 million), representing a 42% to 48% increase from the same period in 2017. This forecast reflects iQIYI's current and preliminary view, which is subject to substantial uncertainty.\nConference Call Information\niQIYI's management will hold an earnings conference call at 9:00 PM on April 26, 2018, U.S. Eastern Time (9:00 AM on April 27, 2018, Beijing/Hong Kong Time).
