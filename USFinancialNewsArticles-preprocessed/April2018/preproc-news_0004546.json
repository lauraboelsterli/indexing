    "text": "Spotify's reference price is set at $132 by the New York Stock Exchange April 3, 2018 \nThe New York Stock Exchange on Monday set the reference price for shares of music streaming service Spotify Technology at $132. \nSpotify is pursuing an unusual direct listing to reach the public markets in place of an initial public offering , and shares are expected to start trading on Tuesday. \nThe reference price is not an offering price for the shares, nor is it the opening public price for shares of the Swedish technology company. \nThe opening public price will be determined by buy and sell orders collected by the NYSE from broker-dealers, the exchange said. Based on those orders, the opening price will be set basedon a designated market makerâ€™s determination of where buy orders can be matched with sell orders at a single price. ",
