The FAA had increased its scrutiny of the engines last year, proposing more testing , after a Southwest flight in 2016 experienced engine failure similar to the incident on Tuesday.\nThe federal government will require ultrasonic testing of engine fan blades, when they've been flown a certain number of times, the FAA said. The National   Board said a fan blade was missing from the engine involved in Tuesday's incident.\n  it said in a statement.",
