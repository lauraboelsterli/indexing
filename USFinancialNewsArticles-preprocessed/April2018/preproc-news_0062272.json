    "text": "April 28, 2018 / 9:52 AM / Updated 9 hours ago Idea Cellular posts sixth straight quarterly loss Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - Idea Cellular Ltd, India’s third-biggest telecoms carrier, posted a sixth straight quarterly net loss that was narrower than expected but showed the firm continues to battle intense competition sparked by upstart rival Reliance Jio.

REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/File Photo\nThe company said on Saturday its net loss widened to 9.62 billion rupees ($144 million) in the quarter ended March 31, from 3.28 billion rupees in the same period a year earlier.\nThat compared with the 14.96 billion rupees average loss estimate compiled from 13 analyst forecasts, Thomson Reuters data showed.\nOperations were also hit by a regulatory change. Effective February, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India had cut international termination charges (ITC) - a fee paid by global long-distance operators to local carriers - to 30 paise from 53 paise.\nIdea Celluar said quarterly revenue from operations dropped 25 percent to 61.37 billion rupees.\nIdea’s results come shortly after India’s top mobile carrier, Bharti Airtel Ltd, posted its lowest quarterly profit in nearly 15 years last Tuesday. It was hurt by the telecoms price war as well as the cut in international termination fees.\nMeanwhile Idea said its merger with Vodafone Group Plc’s Indian unit was likely in the first half of 2018.\n“The merger of Idea and Vodafone India is in the final leg of regulatory approvals,” Idea said in a statement, adding that both companies have set up project management teams and had begun planning identifying “capex and opex synergies”.\nThe merger, announced in March last year, will potentially create India’s biggest telecom operator. It comes after the launch of Reliance Jio in late 2016 sparked a brutal price war, pushing smaller carriers to exit and forcing consolidation in the sector.\n($1 = 66.6100 Indian rupees)",
