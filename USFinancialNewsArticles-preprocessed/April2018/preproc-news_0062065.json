    "text": "3 COMMENTS Chico’s will soon sell its no-iron shirts and statement necklaces through Amazon.com Inc.’s AMZN -0.41% website, making it the latest apparel brand to turn to the fast-growing online retailer as is struggles to reach customers.\nChico’s FAS Inc., CHS -2.36% whose other brands include White House Black Market and Soma, said Monday Chico’s apparel and accessories will be available on Amazon beginning in mid-May and eligible for free shipping through Amazon’s Prime membership program.\nThe decision highlights Amazon’s growing power over the retail landscape as traditionally brick-and-mortar retailers face declining foot traffic and have online presences that are dwarfed by Amazon, which offers everything from grocery delivery to streaming videos.\nChico’s operates 1,460 stores in the U.S. and Canada and in its fourth quarter, comparable sales dropped 5.2% from the prior year.\nRelated Video Amazon wants to deliver everything you want to your doorstep, anywhere in the world. But the e-commerce giant faces several challenges in its pursuit of a global empire. WSJ's Karan Deep Singh breaks down the basics with the help of an Amazon delivery box. Chico’s said it doesn’t expect sales through Amazon to be material to 2018 results. The company generated $2.28 billion of sales in its last fiscal year.\nShares in Chico’s, which rose premarket after the announcement, were down 4.8% in afternoon trading.\nSome companies, including Nike Inc., have tried to avoid adding their wares to the site, believing their brands are powerful enough without the help. But Nike reversed course last year and decided to add its sneakers and clothes to the site after being one of Amazon’s biggest holdouts.\nSears Holdings Corp. , facing declining appliance sales, also began selling its Kenmore appliances through Amazon last year.\nAmazon last week said it would increase the price of its Prime membership program to $119 from $99.\nWrite to Cara Lombardo at cara.lombardo@wsj.com",
