    "text": "Odubel Herrera broke an eighth-inning tie with a run-scoring triple Friday night, sending the Philadelphia Phillies to a 2-1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates in Philadelphia.\nIn a game that featured a strong pitchers’ duel between Pirates right-hander Ivan Nova and Phillies righty Ben Lively, Philadelphia broke through for the game-winning run against the Pittsburgh bullpen.\nCesar Hernandez led off the last of the eighth with a double off the third Pirates pitcher, George Kontos (1-2). After Hernandez took third on an infield out, Herrera lashed his triple to right field, giving the Phillies their first lead of the game at 2-1.\nPhillies closer Hector Neris held on from there for his third save, shutting the door on the Pirates in the ninth after giving up a one-out double to Jordy Mercer. Luis Garcia (2-1), who pitched a scoreless eighth inning, got the win.\nNova and Lively had dueling shutouts until the Pirates were the first to push across a run in the top of the sixth. Lively set the stage by hitting Francisco Cervelli with a pitch. Colin Moran’s double sent Cervelli to third, and he scored on Mercer’s sacrifice fly.\nThe Phillies wasted no time getting even in the bottom of the inning, when singles by Carlos Santana and Herrera put runners on first and third with one out. Rhys Hoskins tied the game at 1-1 with a fielder’s choice ground ball.\nBoth starting pitchers departed after the sixth inning, and neither got a decision.\nNova allowed five hits in his six innings. He struck out three and did not walk a batter.\nLively likewise gave up five hits, but also mixed in three walks. He struck out four.\nHernandez, Santana, Herrera and Maikel Franco had two hits apiece for the Phillies, who improved to 7-1 at home with the ninth win in their last 11 games. Philadelphia had opened a 10-game homestand with a 7-0 thrashing of Pittsburgh on Thursday night.\nGregory Polanco collected a double and a single for the Pirates, who have lost four of their last five.\nThe Phillies out-hit the Pirates 8-6.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
