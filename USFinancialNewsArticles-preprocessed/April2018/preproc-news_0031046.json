    "text": "MONTREAL, April 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Blockchain Mining Ltd. (“BLCM” or the “Company”) (TASE:BLCM) (OTC:BITFY) is pleased to announce that it has completed its transaction with Backbone Hosting Solutions Inc. (“Bitfarms”), operating under the commercial brand “Bitfarms”, whereby the Company acquired 60.7% of the issued and outstanding shares of Bitfarms in exchange for 23,124,861 common shares of the Company, and the right to acquire 17,335,090 common shares of the Company, all of which have been issued to founding shareholders and principals of Bitfarms (the “Transaction”).\n“The transaction confirms our role as a leader in blockchain technology. We are fully prepared to pursue our expansion in Canada, where we have secured access to more than 135 megawatts of clean, sustainable hydroelectricity,” said Emiliano J. Grodzki, Chief Strategy Officer.\nFor the last four months, the Transaction has been reviewed by the Israel Securities Authority (ISA) and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE).\n“ISA and TASE took the time to regulate this emerging industry. They have shown themselves to be a world-class destination for blockchain companies. We would like to thank them warmly,” said Emiliano J. Grodzki.\nWith clean hydroelectricity, cold weather, competitive electricity rates and innovative universities, Quebec is becoming a global hub for blockchain technology and Bitfarms is leading the way. Bitfarms is determined to work with Quebec decision makers, hydroelectricity providers and local communities in order to continue its growth in the province. For the last six months, Hydro-Québec, the province’s main electricity producer, has worked relentlessly in order to establish the basis for a successful and sustainable blockchain industry.\n“Hydro-Québec wants to attract the best blockchain companies in the province, and the government of Québec has publicly shown support for blockchain technology on numerous occasions,” said Wes Fulford, Chief Executive Officer.\n“Hydro-Québec provides a power supply that is clean, reliable and sustainable at a very competitive price,” said Emiliano J. Grodzki.\n“Our development pipeline is stronger than ever, and the completion of the Transaction is a major achievement for our team. During the last 56 days of 2017, our operations produced over $200,000 in daily revenue when you include cryptocurrencies in inventory. We have since grown our installed capacity, and each day we are seeing more and more opportunities for growth and integration,” said Wes Fulford.\nAbout Blockchain Mining Ltd.\nBlockchain Mining Ltd. (TASE:BLCM) (OTC:BITFY) through its Transaction with Backbone Hosting Solutions Inc. (Bitfarms) owns and operates blockchain farms that power the global decentralized financial economy. Bitfarms provides computing power to cryptocurrency networks such as bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum, litecoin, and dash earning fees from each network for securing and processing transactions, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Such factors include, among others, risks relating to uncertainties associated with the business combination; risks relating to certain directors and officers of the Company possibly having interests in the business combination that are different from other shareholders; the global economic climate; dilution; the Company’s limited operating history; future capital needs and uncertainty of additional financing; the competitive nature of the industry; currency exchange risks; the need for the Company to manage its planned growth and expansion; the effects of product development and need for continued technology change; protection of proprietary rights; the effect of government regulation and compliance on the Company and the industry; network security risks; the ability of the Company to maintain properly working systems; reliance on key personnel; global economic and financial market deterioration impeding access to capital or increasing the cost of capital; volatile securities markets impacting security pricing unrelated to operating performance.

The Company has also assumed that no significant events occur outside of the Bitfarm's normal course of business. Although the Company has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially, there may be other factors that cause results not to be as anticipated, estimated or intended. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate as actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking information. The Company undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking information other than as required by law.\nSource:Backbone Hosting Solutions Inc.",
