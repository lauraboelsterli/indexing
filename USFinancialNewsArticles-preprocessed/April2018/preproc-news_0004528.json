Global Atomic’s Uranium Division includes six exploration permits in the Republic of Niger covering an area of approximately 750 km 2 . Uranium mineralization has been identified on each of the permits, with the most significant discovery being the DASA deposit situated on the Adrar Emoles III concession, discovered in 2010 by Global Atomic geologists through grassroots field exploration. The DASA deposit is currently under development in order to begin shipments to Orano Mining’s uranium processing plant in Arlit, Republic of Niger, under an MOU signed in July 2017.\nGlobal Atomic’s Base Metals Division holds a 49% interest in the BST joint venture, operating a facility located in Iskenderun, Turkey that converts EAFD (Electric Arc Furnace Dust) into a high grade zinc oxide concentrate which is sold to zinc smelters around the world. The Company’s joint venture partner, Befesa Zinc S.A.U. (“Befesa”), holds a 51% interest in and is the operator of BST. Befesa is a market leader in EAFD recycling, capturing approximately 45% to 50% of European EAFD market with facilities located throughout Europe and Korea.\nKey contacts: Stephen G. Roman George A.
