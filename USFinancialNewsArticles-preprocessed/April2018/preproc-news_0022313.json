    "text": "April 11, 2018 / 5:15 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Tottenham's Kane awarded Stoke winner after successful appeal Reuters Staff 1 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Tottenham Hotspur striker Harry Kane has been awarded his team’s winning goal in last weekend’s 2-1 victory at Stoke City after a successful appeal to the Premier League’s Goal Accreditation Appeals Panel. Soccer Football - Premier League - Stoke City vs Tottenham Hotspur - bet365 Stadium, Stoke-on-Trent, Britain - April 7, 2018 Tottenham's Harry Kane reacts REUTERS/Dylan Martinez \nKane’s league tally now stands at 25 goals and the panel’s decision boosts his chances of securing a hat-trick of Golden Boots in the league. \nLiverpool’s in-form forward Mohamed Salah currently leads the race to be the league’s leading scorer this season with 29 goals. \nTottenham’s second goal last Saturday was initially credited to midfielder Christian Eriksen, but the London club said in their appeal that the Denmark international’s 63rd minute free kick had gone in after clipping Kane’s shoulder. \nA three-member panel awarded the goal to Kane after taking the player’s testimony into account and reviewing footage from the match.
