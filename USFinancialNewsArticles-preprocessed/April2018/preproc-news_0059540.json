    "text": "WARSAW, April 26 (Reuters) - The largest labour union at Poland’s national airline LOT will begin a strike on May 1 that could lead to delays at Warsaw Chopin airport, the head of the ZZPPiL union said.\n“We will protest until the expectations of the employees are met,” Monika Zelazik told state news agency PAP on Thursday referring to demands that LOT change the way it compensates employees.\nZelazik said the strike is likely to have the biggest impact at Warsaw Chopin, where flights may be grounded or delayed.\nLOT spokesman Adrian Kubicki said the strike, if it goes ahead, would be illegal as it was not backed by all six labour unions that have negotiated with LOT.\nEarlier in April, German airline Lufthansa cancelled some of its flights after labour union Verdi said it would extend strikes to airports to apply more pressure in pay talks.
