    "text": "SINGAPORE, April 19 (Reuters) - Singaporeâ€™s Keppel Corp posted a 34 percent rise in first-quarter profit, boosted by a divestment gain and higher contributions from property trading in Singapore and China.\nKeppel, whose businesses range from rig-building to property development, posted a net profit of S$337 million ($257 million)for the quarter ended March, versus S$252 million a year-ago.\nEarnings included a divestment gain of S$289 million from the sale of its stake in a Chinese marina development.\nTotal revenue rose 18 percent to S$1.47 billion.\nKeppel had posted a net loss for the quarter ended December 2017, its first such loss in 14 years, after accounting for a huge fine its rig-building unit agreed to pay to resolve investigations into charges it bribed Brazilian officials.
