    "text": "Washington D.C., April 17, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Xalles Holdings Inc. (OTC: XALL), a company focusing on accelerating fintech companies, leveraging blockchain technology for financial reconciliation, and payment auditing solutions, this week executed a Share Purchase Agreement for the acquisition of BlockForge Inc., a blockchain design, development, and implementation firm.\nAs reported earlier this week, Xalles intends to utilize a blockchain-based platform to overcome client challenges in investment & financing systems (IFS) and financial transaction reconciliation (FTR). The BlockForge acquisition is one step towards successfully implementing these new service offerings, which are a key part of the Xalles business strategy in 2018. Xalles plans to create solutions with the appropriate level of transparency, privacy and operational efficiency, utilizing the company’s core X2X technology.\n“The acquisition of BlockForge, Paul Erickson’s management expertise, and the resources he brings to our company will help form the nucleus of our new technology team for focusing on blockchain-based solutions,” said Xalles CEO, Thomas Nash. He continued, “The new team’s first assignment within Xalles will be to help design the new blockchain-based version of the X2X platform, including smart contracts.”\n“There is a lot of synergy between BlockForge and Xalles. We both have a vision that will create a new way to support large investment projects, and create operational transparency in process and companies in which investments are deployed,” said BlockForge President, Paul Erickson. “I am excited to see our combined resources create tremendous, innovative solutions in blockchain and other emerging technologies, and to personally be part of the leadership team to realize the joint vision.”\nThe BlockForge acquisition transaction is planned to close on or before April 30, 2018. Upon closure, BlockForge Inc. will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xalles Holdings Inc. The share purchase agreement also provides the opportunity for BlockForge shareholders to become shareholders of Xalles through the recently created Series C Preferred Shares.\nAdditional updates will follow in the coming weeks as the company continues to execute on its business plan and assembles the corporate components to achieve its goals.\nAbout Xalles Holdings Inc.
