    "text": "BEIJING, April 4 (Reuters) - China has never given in to external pressure, Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said on Wednesday, shortly after Beijing unveiled a list of U.S. goods it will target in response to planned U.S. tariffs.\nExternal pressure will instead promote Chinaâ€™s development and innovation, Zhu told reporters in Beijing.\nFriction is hard to avoid in fast-growing China-U.S. trade, and huge challenges face the two sides, but Zhu said he still hoped relations could return to a healthy track, since a trade war could hurt all sides.
