Some of them used the AGM to voice their discontent.\n“Why do you come to agreements with the workers and not with us,” asked Alexander von Vietinghoff-Scheel of Germany’s DSW association for private investors.\n“In principle we have no objections to such deliberations but we want to be included.”\nWinfried Mathes, a fund manager of Deka Investment which owns 1 percent of Continental’s equity capital, said shareholders welcomed any plans designed to increase the value of the company they have invested in.\n“But given such a far-reaching modification (as under discussion at Continental), an intensive dialogue with you is very important to us,” Mathes said, calling on top executives to provide some detail of the possible changes.\nAnalysts have said a possible overhaul of Continental’s diversified structure could result in creating more independently run divisions for the powertrain, electronics and rubber operations.\nBut Degenhart kept his cards close to his chest.\n“We are in the phase of analysing (options), that’s why there are no concrete plans as yet that can be communicated,” the CEO said, declining to give more detail.\nEarlier on Friday, Continental said the impact of currencies caused a 9 percent drop in adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) in the first quarter and stuck with expectations that exchange rate effects could dent revenue by more than 1 billion euros ($1.21 billion) this year.\nShares in the group were trading down 1.3 percent at 221.30 euros as of 1233 GMT.\nThe company last week scaled back its profitability outlook for 2018 on expectations that currency headwinds and inventory valuation would inflict a 150 million euros negative hit to first-half earnings.
