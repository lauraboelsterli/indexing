    "text": "\nAccording to the Bank of Korea, South Korea's central bank, North Korea's 2016 GDP in real terms stood at 32.0 trillion won ($28.50 billion), a fraction of South Korea's 1,508.3 trillion won ($1.34 trillion). South Korea's per capita GDP reached $30,000 last year and could surpass Italy in 2018 .\nBefore the latest round of sanctions, the bank estimates North Korea's GDP grew by nearly 4 percent in 2016, after shrinking 1.1 percent from a drought a year earlier. (North Korea does not issue economic figures, so South Korea's central bank bases its estimates from intelligence sources.) Seoul's trade volume also dwarfs Pyongyang's. \"The South trades as much in one day as the North in a year,\" said Noland.\nSouth Korea also has developed a vibrant start-up economy, with several companies, such as Coupang and Yellow Mobile, reaching unicorn status — valued at more than $1 billion. Last year, according to the Korean Venture Capital Association, investors put 2,380.3 billion won ($2.23 billion) into Korean start-ups , up 9.3 percent over 2016.\nSouth Koreans have learned to live with threats from the North. \"The difference in perception inside and outside of Korea could not be more different,\" said Bom Kim, founder and CEO of Coupang, Korea's largest online retailer, which received a $1.4 billion investment from Softbank in 2015. \"If you surveyed a hundred people in the country, there's no panic. A lot of this is theater, but if you watched the news on TV you would think something was about to break out.\" Thorny challenges\nIn the long term, South Korea faces some thorny economic problems . The OECD says its economy is slowing due to policies aimed at protecting small businesses rather than making them more efficient and because its population is aging. While the manufacturing sector includes world class conglomerates like Samsung and LG, productivity in the service sector is low.\nIf geopolitical tensions ease with its Northern neighbor, South Korea would probably gain favor with foreign investors now fearful of political risk. But it's the North Korea that could really see a boost, economists say.\nThere could be huge benefits from reunification , although there is no sign this could happen anytime soon. In 2015, the Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, a government think-tank, estimated that a unified Korea could generate an $8.7 trillion economy by 2055, 1.7 times the projected size of South Korea alone.\nNo one will guess the possible outcome of talks between the two Koreas or – if it happens – between Kim Jong Un and President Trump. But if the past is any indication, the South Korean economy will keep plugging along, regardless of the outcome of negotiations. Global Investing Hot Spots ",
