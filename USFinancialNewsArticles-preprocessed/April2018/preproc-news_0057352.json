The loan is secured by multiple commercial real estate properties which cumulatively have a 95% loan to value.\n(2)\nThe vast majority of the increase to $55 million in non-performing discontinued loans at March 31, 2018 from $16 million at year end 2017 resulted from the Bank’s largest credit exposure. The loan has unpaid principal of $36.9 million and is collateralized by a hotel under construction and parking lot in the southeastern United States. Based upon an independent first quarter 2018 appraisal, the loan to value is approximately 80% on an as is basis, with personal guarantees of certain of the borrower’s principals. The loan became delinquent in 2018 and the borrower, a development corporation, subsequently declared bankruptcy.
