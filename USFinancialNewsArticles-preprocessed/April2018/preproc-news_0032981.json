(NASDAQ GS: IBKR) an automated global electronic broker and market maker, today reported diluted earnings per share on a comprehensive basis of $0.65 for the 2018, compared to diluted earnings per share on a comprehensive basis of $0.40 for the same period in 2017. Excluding other comprehensive income, the Company reported diluted earnings per share of $0.63 for the quarter, compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.34 for the same period in 2017.\nNet revenues were $527 million and income before income taxes was $340 million this quarter, compared to net revenues of $374 million and income before income taxes of $213 million for the same period in 2017. The results for the quarter were positively impacted by strong growth in net interest income, which increased $75 million, or 53%, and higher commissions, which increased $66 million, or 43% from the year-ago quarter.\nIn addition, the results for the quarter include a $38 million gain on our currency diversification strategy, compared to a $49 million gain in the same period in 2017; and a $3 million net mark-to-market loss on our U.S. government securities portfolio, compared to a $1 million net mark-to-market loss in the same period in 2017.\nThe Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share. This dividend is payable on June 14, 2018 to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2018.\nBusiness Highlights\n65% pretax profit margin for this quarter, up from 57% in the year-ago quarter. 63% Electronic Brokerage pretax profit margin for this quarter, up from 59% in the year-ago quarter.

In this quarter, our currency diversification strategy increased our comprehensive earnings by $46 million, as the U.S. dollar value of the GLOBAL increased by approximately 0.69%. The effects of the currency diversification strategy are reported as components of (1) Other Income in the corporate segment and (2) Other Comprehensive Income (“OCI”).\nConference Call Information:\nInteractive Brokers Group, Inc. will hold a conference call with investors today, April 17, 2018, at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss its quarterly results.
