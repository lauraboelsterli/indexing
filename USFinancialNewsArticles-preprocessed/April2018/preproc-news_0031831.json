    "text": "WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP, N.J., April 17, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Parke Bancorp, Inc. (\"Parke Bancorp\") (NASDAQ: \"PKBK\"), the parent company of Parke Bank, announced its operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2018.\nParke Bancorp reported net income available to common shareholders of $5.5 million, or $0.69 per common share and $0.58 per diluted common share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. This compares to net income of $3.2 million, or $0.42 per common share and $0.35 per diluted common share for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.\nThe following is a recap of the significant items that impacted the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same quarter last year: an increase of $2.4 million in interest income, primarily attributable to higher loan volumes and a higher yield on loans, partially offset by an increase of $643,000 in interest expense due to higher deposit volumes and rates; a $100,000 decrease in the provision for loan losses primarily due to improving credit quality; and a $474,000 increase in noninterest income attributable to a $178,000 gain on the sale of SBA loans and higher service charges on deposit accounts. Income tax expense decreased by $169,000 due to a lower tax rate of 24.2%, compared to 36.7% last year due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December of 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, Parke Bancorp's total assets increased to $1.17 billion, from $1.14 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $29.5 million or 2.6%.\nParke Bancorp's total investment securities portfolio decreased to $37.0 million at March 31, 2018, from $40.3 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $3.3 million or 8.1%.\nParke Bancorp's net loans increased to $1.04 billion at March 31, 2018, from $1.01 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $30.2 million or 3.0%.\nAt March 31, 2018, Parke Bancorp had $4.2 million in nonperforming loans representing 0.4% of total loans, a decrease of $363,000, or 8.0%, from $4.5 million of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2017. Other Real Estate Owned (\"OREO\") at March 31, 2018 was $6.8 million, compared to $7.2 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of 5.7%. Nonperforming assets (consisting of nonperforming loans and OREO) represented 0.94% of total assets at March 31, 2018, as compared to 1.04% of total assets at December 31, 2017. Loans past due 30 to 89 days were $525,000 at March 31, 2018, an increase of $81,000 from the previous quarter end.\nAt March 31, 2018, Parke Bancorp's allowance for loan losses was $17.1 million, as compared to $16.5 million at December 31, 2017. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans was 1.64% at March 31, 2018, and 1.63% at December 31, 2017. The ratio of allowance for loan losses to non-performing loans improved to 409.48% at March 31, 2018, compared to 364.64%, at December 31, 2017.\nAt March 31, 2018, Parke Bancorp's total deposits were $902.2 million, up from $866.4 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $35.8 million or 4.1%.\nParke Bancorp's total borrowings were $118.1 million at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $10.0 million from December 31, 2017, or 7.8%.\nTotal shareholders' equity increased to $138.9 million at March 31, 2018, from $134.8 million at December 31, 2017, an increase of $4.1 million or 3.1% due to the accumulation of earnings.\nVito S. Pantilione, President and Chief Executive Officer of Parke Bancorp and Parke Bank, provided the following statement:\n\"The first quarter of operating under the new Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is complete, and it looks pretty good. We had net income of $5.5 million and that is a 75% increase over our earnings from the 1st quarter of 2017. When you eliminate the additional income from the tax savings, we still had a 45% increase in net income from the first quarter of 2017. The strength of our profitability continues to be supported by the strong growth of our loan portfolio, combined with the tight controls we implement on our expenses. We are also proud of the improvement of our asset quality, with a decrease in our non-performing loans and a decrease in OREO exposure. Our company's nonperforming assets went below 1% of total assets at March 31, 2018, which was accomplished while preserving shareholder value. Parke Bank is well positioned to take advantage of future market opportunities to continue growing our Company and supporting our profitability.\"\nParke Bancorp, Inc. is the holding company for Parke Bank, which operates from its corporate headquarters in Washington Township, New Jersey and 6 branch offices in Washington Township, New Jersey, Northfield, New Jersey, Galloway Township, New Jersey, Collingswood, New Jersey, Center City Philadelphia, and Chinatown in Philadelphia.
