    "text": "April 26, 2018 / 3:52 PM / Updated 35 minutes ago Swedish DJ Avicii 'could not go on any longer,' family says Reuters Staff 2 Min Read\n(Reuters) - The family of Swedish DJ Avicii, who was found dead last week in Oman at the age of 28, said on Thursday that he struggled with life and “could not go on any longer.” Swedish DJ and record producer Avicii, one of the biggest stars of electronic dance music (EDM) in Europe, died at the age of 28. Avicii, whose real name is Tim Bergling, was known for international hits like \"Wake Me Up\" and \"Hey Brother\". He announced in 2016 that he was retiring from touring, but he kept making music and was nominated for a Billboard music award earlier in the week that he died. Avicii told Billboard magazine he decided to stop touring in 2016 for health reasons. Three years earlier, he underwent surgery for a ruptured appendix and a blocked gall bladder and in 2012, he was hospitalized with pancreatitis. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson\nIn their first comment on his death, the cause of which has not been disclosed, the family said in a statement: “He really struggled with thoughts about Meaning, Life, Happiness. He could not go on any longer. He wanted to find peace.”\nThe statement appeared to suggest that the electronic dance musician and producer took his own life. His U.S. publicist, Diana Baron, declined to comment further.

He was found dead in Muscat, Oman, last Friday but no cause of death was released. Slideshow (3 Images)\nAvicii, known for international hits such as “Wake Me Up” and “Hey Brother,” announced in 2016 that he was retiring from touring, citing the demands of the lifestyle.\n“Our beloved Tim was a seeker, a fragile artistic soul searching for answers to existential questions. An over-achieving perfectionist who traveled and worked hard at a pace that led to extreme stress,” the family’s statement said on Thursday.\n“When he stopped touring, he wanted to find a balance in life to be happy and be able to do what he loved most – music,” it added.\nAvicii’s death shocked the music world, particularly in Europe.\nChurch bells played one of Avicii’s biggest hits in the Swedish capital Stockholm on Tuesday.
