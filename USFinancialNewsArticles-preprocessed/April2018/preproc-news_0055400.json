    "text": "SJW Group Board of Directors Unanimously Reaffirms Commitment to Merger of Equals with Connecticut Water and its Potential to Create Significant Long-Term Value for Shareholders and Benefits for Customers, Employees and Communities\nPreliminary S-4 Proxy and Registration Statement Filed; Important Step Toward Closing Merger of Equals with Connecticut Water\nSAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) confirmed today that it has rejected an unsolicited, non-binding indication of interest it received from California Water Service Group (NYSE: CWT) (“Cal Water”) regarding a potential proposal to acquire all issued and outstanding shares of SJW Group for $68.25 per share in cash.\nThe SJW Group Board of Directors, following a careful and thorough review in consultation with SJW Group’s management and legal and financial advisors consistent with its fiduciary duties, determined that Cal Water’s non-binding indication of interest neither constituted nor was reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal as defined in SJW Group’s merger agreement with Connecticut Water Service, Inc. (NASDAQ: CTWS) (“Connecticut Water”).\nThe SJW Group Board concluded that Cal Water’s all-cash transaction described in the non-binding indication of interest would not permit SJW Group’s shareholders the opportunity to share in the benefits expected from being shareholders of the combined company with Connecticut Water. The long-term benefits of the merger of equals transaction with Connecticut Water include increased scale, enhanced financial strength and geographic diversity; expected continued payment of dividends over time; anticipated higher future growth profile and associated share price appreciation; the tax-free nature of the merger of equals with Connecticut Water; and significant earnings accretion – all of which the SJW Group Board believes are unique to the proposed merger of equals transaction.\nIn addition, Cal Water has not stated its plans for all employees should it acquire SJW Group, whereas SJW Group has publicly stated that it will continue to honor its commitments to all employees and believes that the merger of equals with Connecticut Water will provide better opportunities and outcomes for all employees of both companies.\nThe SJW Group Board determined that there is a significant risk Cal Water’s proposed transaction would not close in a reasonable period of time, if at all, due to the potentially protracted regulatory review taking as long as 18 months, the substantial amount of financing that the proposed all-cash transaction requires and the uncommitted nature of Cal Water’s sources of financing.\nThe SJW Group Board continues to be committed to its existing merger agreement with Connecticut Water, which remains on track to close during the fourth quarter of 2018. This combination will create a leading water utility company positioned to drive growth, serve customers and create opportunities for all employees across a national footprint. The SJW Group Board continues to believe the merger of equals provides the shareholders of both SJW Group and Connecticut Water with the best opportunity for value creation over the long term and yields benefits for both companies’ customers, employees and communities.\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC is serving as financial advisor to SJW Group, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is legal counsel.\nThe text of SJW Group’s rejection letter to Cal Water follows:\nApril 25, 2018\nCalifornia Water Service Group\nAttn: Martin A. Kropelnicki and Peter C. Nelson\n1720 North First Street\nSan Jose, California 95112\nDear Messrs. Kropelnicki and Nelson,\nWe received your unsolicited non-binding indication of interest, dated April 4, 2018, to acquire SJW Group for $68.25 per share in cash. After carefully and thoroughly evaluating your non-binding indication of interest in consultation with our management and legal and financial advisors, the SJW Group Board of Directors has determined that it neither constitutes nor is reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal as defined in SJW Group’s merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) with Connecticut Water Service, Inc. (“Connecticut Water”).\nAccordingly, the Board voted unanimously to reject your proposal.\nIn reaching its determination, as more fully described below, the Board found that your offer of $68.25 per share significantly undervalues SJW Group’s long-term prospects and is not in the best interest of our shareholders. We are enthusiastic about the future prospects of SJW Group, all the more so in light of our pending merger of equals (the “Merger”) with Connecticut Water. We believe the Merger has the potential to create significant long-term value for our shareholders – value that our shareholders would not be permitted to share as part of your proposal.\nUpon consummation of the Merger, SJW Group is expected to be the third largest investor-owned water and wastewater utility in the United States. With a strong multi-state presence in Connecticut, Maine, California and Texas, SJW Group will be well-positioned to continue to deliver a robust and stable dividend, highly attractive earnings and growth accretion to our shareholders, who will own approximately 60% of the combined company.\nOur Board concluded that your all-cash transaction described in the non-binding indication of interest would not permit our shareholders the opportunity to share in the benefits expected from being shareholders of the combined company with Connecticut Water, including the opportunity to realize the long-term benefits of increased scale, enhanced financial strength and geographic diversity; expected continued payment of dividends over time; anticipated higher future growth profile and associated share price appreciation; and significant earnings accretion – all of which our Board believes are unique to the Merger with Connecticut Water. As a result of all of these factors, the Board believes that the Merger will result in our shareholders having the ability to realize greater long-term value than in your proposed transaction.\nOur board also believes that the Merger provides greater flexibility to grow the business through increased investments, the ability to compete more effectively across a national footprint, as well as increased scale and cost savings. We are uniquely positioned to integrate the culture and operations of SJW Group and Connecticut Water. We do not anticipate any job losses as a result of this transaction and, following the Merger, employees in the combined company will have additional opportunities for career development and geographic mobility as part of a larger, stronger and more diverse organization. This is a commitment to our employees that we likely would not be able to honor if we were to accept your proposal.\nAdditionally, our Board determined there is a significant risk that your proposed transaction would not close in a reasonable period of time, if at all, due to the risks presented by the potentially protracted regulatory review taking as long as 18 months, the substantial amount of financing that your proposed all-cash transaction requires and the uncommitted nature of your sources of financing. Other factors include that your proposal is a taxable transaction for our shareholders versus the tax-free merger with Connecticut Water, the non-binding nature of your indication of interest with significant contingencies, including, among other things, performance of due diligence and negotiation of binding documentation – a process that would further extend your transaction’s closing time well beyond our fourth quarter 2018 target for closing.\nSJW Group continues to be committed to the existing Merger with Connecticut Water and continues to believe the Merger provides the shareholders of both companies with the best opportunity for value creation over the long term, including:\nHighly attractive earnings and growth accretion. The combination is expected to be mid- to high-single digit percentage accretive to each company’s earnings per share. It will also offer greater flexibility to grow the business through increased investments and to compete more effectively in a fragmented industry. The new company should have the opportunity to expand across a national footprint with a leading forecasted growth rate. A strong balance sheet that enhances financial flexibility to increase growth. The combined company is expected to benefit from a robust balance sheet and enhanced financial flexibility, with total assets of $2.4 billion. This will result in a stronger financial foundation and increased capital markets access yielding a lower cost of capital, better enabling the new organization to compete for attractive growth opportunities on a national level. A solid credit profile that supports share repurchase. The incremental debt capacity resulting from the merger of equals, and the expectation that the combined company will maintain a strong \"A\" credit profile, is expected to enable the combined company to pursue a share repurchase program of up to $100 million. Enhanced equity value. Your non-binding indication of interest significantly undervalues SJW Group’s long-term prospects and is not in the best interest of SJW Group's shareholders. The Board believes that the merger of equals with Connecticut Water will result in shareholders having the ability to realize greater long-term value than in your proposed transaction.\nIn addition to benefits to shareholders of both companies, the proposed merger of equals with Connecticut Water will benefit employees, customers and communities of both companies in the following ways:\nHonoring commitments to employees. SJW Group and Connecticut Water do not anticipate any job losses as a result of the merger of equals. Following the close of the transaction, employees will have additional opportunities for career development and geographic mobility as part of a larger, stronger and more diverse organization. The companies do not anticipate any significant changes in employee compensation or benefits packages as a result of the transaction. SJW Group values its trusted union partnerships, and all union contracts will continue to be honored. Delivering customer benefits. The new organization will maintain the longstanding commitments of SJW Group and Connecticut Water to outstanding customer service, which will be enhanced by the sharing of best practices, operational expertise and more extensive resources. There will be no change in customer rates as a result of the merger of equals, and the operating subsidiaries of the combined company will each continue to be subject to oversight by their respective state regulatory commissions for rates and quality of service. Serving local communities with a passionate, dedicated team of locally-based water professionals. Each of the combined company’s operating utilities and their customers will continue to be supported locally by a team of passionate, dedicated employees and existing leaders. They will continue to bring their extensive certifications, operating experience and local knowledge to the communities where they live, work and serve. Strengthening existing community ties. In addition to retaining dedicated employee teams across its footprint, the new company will maintain strong community ties and participation in community events and organizations in Connecticut, Maine, California and Texas. The combined company will continue to focus on supporting economic development with investments in growth, safety and reliability. Advancing environmental stewardship. Environmental stewardship is a core value for both organizations, given the local nature of the water business. Both companies have been industry leaders in their efforts to promote water conservation and protect the valuable lands and water resources that have been entrusted to them. That focus will continue as the combined company seeks to further reduce its environmental footprint and look for opportunities to improve the sustainability of its business practices. Providing increased scale, financial strength and geographic diversity and deep operating expertise. In addition to an expanded market presence, increased scale and more diverse geographic footprint, the new organization will provide the opportunity for investments in service and reliability that can enhance value for shareholders as well as for customers and communities through our strong multi-state presence with high-quality and well-run operations, as well as constructive regulatory relationships in Connecticut, Maine, California and Texas. Leveraging technology and capital investments. The combined company can cost effectively implement updated customer service tools across Connecticut and Maine utility operations by leveraging leading Information Services and Technology systems that have been established at SJW Group. The new company will honor commitments for approximately $200 million of annual capital investments across its combined operations, including moving forward with the construction of the new surface water treatment facility in Saco, Maine.\nWe remain committed to executing the Merger Agreement with Connecticut Water and are confident in its consummation during the fourth quarter of 2018.\nSincerely,\nEric W.
