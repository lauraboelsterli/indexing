    "text": "April 19 (Reuters) - GW Pharmaceuticals Plcâ€™s cannabis-based drug to treat a severe form of childhood epilepsy was unanimously backed on Thursday by an advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\nThe positive vote sets the stage for the approval of the first-ever cannabis-derived treatment in the United States.\nFDA staff on Tuesday gave a favorable review to the drug, Epidiolex, saying that findings from three clinical studies showed that the drug reduced frequency of seizures in patients with the disease when added to a current therapy.\nReporting by Manas Mishra in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila\n ",
