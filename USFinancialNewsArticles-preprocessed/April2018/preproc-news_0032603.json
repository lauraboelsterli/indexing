Our smart beds differentiate and strengthen our competitive position through measurably better sleep,” said Shelly Ibach, President and CEO of Sleep Number. “We expect to benefit from the related growing enthusiasm for our brand and operating efficiencies as we progress our initiatives this year.”\nFirst Quarter Overview\nNet sales were $389 million, down 1% versus 12% growth for the prior year Gross profit rate of 61.1% versus 62.6% for the same period last year, primarily due to inefficiencies of operating two supply chains as we transition to 360 smart beds Earnings per diluted share were $0.52, compared with $0.56 the prior year\nCash Flows and Balance Sheet Review\nCash provided by operations was $49 million for the first quarter Invested $9 million in capital expenditures, compared with $13 million for the same period last year Increased share repurchases 50% to $75 million for the first quarter, compared with $50 million last year Return on invested capital (ROIC) was 14.1% for the trailing twelve-month period, well above our cost of capital\nFinancial Outlook\nThe company reiterates its outlook for 2018 earnings per diluted share of $1.70 to $2.00. The outlook assumes mid- to high-single digit sales growth for 2018. The 2018 outlook assumes an estimated effective income tax rate of 25%. The company anticipates 2018 capital expenditures to be approximately $50 million. The outlook contemplates a slow growth economy.\nConference Call Information\nManagement will host its regularly scheduled conference call to discuss the company’s results at 5 p.m. EDT (4 p.m. CDT; 2 p.m. PDT) today.

SLEEP NUMBER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nEarnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA)\n(in thousands)\nWe define earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) as net income plus: income tax expense, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and asset impairments. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is a useful indicator of our financial performance and our ability to generate cash from operating activities. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled definitions used by other companies. The table below reconciles Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, to the comparable GAAP financial measure:\nThree Months Ended Trailing-Twelve Months Ended March 31, April 1, March 31, April 1, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net income $ 20,548 $ 24,461 $ 61,164 $ 62,909 Income tax expense 5,828 11,229 20,560 28,913 Interest expense 527 182 1,320 887 Depreciation and amortization 15,612 16,152 60,537 59,305 Stock-based compensation 3,084 3,704 15,143 11,899 Asset impairments - - 244 59 Adjusted EBITDA $ 45,599 $ 55,728 $ 158,968 $ 163,972 Free Cash Flow (in thousands) Three Months Ended Trailing-Twelve Months Ended March 31, April 1, March 31, April 1, 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 49,256 $ 86,869 $ 134,994 $ 174,533 Subtract: Purchases of property and equipment 8,805 13,211 55,423 58,774 Free cash flow $ 40,451 $ 73,658 $ 79,571 $ 115,759\nNote - Our Adjusted EBITDA calculation and our \"free cash flow\" data are considered non-GAAP financial measures and are not in accordance with, or preferable to, \"as reported,\" or GAAP financial data. However, we are providing this information as we believe it facilitates analysis of the Company's financial performance by investors and financial analysts. GAAP - generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. SLEEP NUMBER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCalculation of Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\n(in thousands)\nROIC is a financial measure we use to determine how efficiently we deploy our capital. It quantifies the return we earn on our invested capital. Management believes ROIC is also a useful metric for investors and financial analysts. We compute ROIC as outlined below. Our definition and calculation of ROIC may not be comparable to similarly titled definitions and calculations used by other companies. The tables below reconcile net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT) and total invested capital, which are non-GAAP financial measures, to the comparable GAAP financial measures:\nTrailing-Twelve Months Ended March 31, April 1, 2018 2017 Net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT)\nOperating income $ 82,987 $ 92,580 Add: Rent expense 1 74,933 69,217 Add: Interest income 56 128 Less: Depreciation on capitalized operating leases 2 (19,266 ) (17,550 ) Less: Income taxes 3 (41,486 ) (48,050 ) NOPAT $ 97,224 $ 96,325 Average invested capital\nTotal equity $ 35,997 $ 134,151 Less: Cash greater than target 4 - - Add: Long-term debt 5 75,800 - Add: Capitalized operating lease obligations 6 599,464 553,736 Total invested capital at end of period $ 711,261 $ 687,887 Average invested capital 7 $ 688,758 $ 692,896 Return on invested capital (ROIC) 8 14.1 % 13.9 % 1 Rent expense is added back to operating income to show the impact of owning versus leasing the related assets. 2 Depreciation is based on the average of the last five fiscal quarters' ending capitalized operating lease obligations (see note 6) for the respective reporting periods with an assumed thirty-year useful life. This is subtracted from operating income to illustrate the impact of owning versus leasing the related assets. 3 Reflects annual effective income tax rates, before discrete adjustments, of 29.9% and 33.3% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. 4 Cash greater than target is defined as cash, cash equivalents and marketable debt securities less customer prepayments in excess of $100 million. 5 Long-term debt includes existing capital lease obligations, if applicable. In conjunction with increasing our revolving credit facility to $300 million in the first quarter of 2018, we include borrowings under that agreement, including borrowings classified as short term. 6 A multiple of eight times annual rent expense is used as an estimate for capitalizing our operating lease obligations. The methodology utilized aligns with the methodology of a nationally recognized credit rating agency. 7 Average invested capital represents the average of the last five fiscal quarters' ending invested capital balances. 8 ROIC equals NOPAT divided by average invested capital. Note - Our ROIC calculation and data are considered non-GAAP financial measures and are not in accordance with, or preferable to, GAAP financial data. However, we are providing this information as we believe it facilitates analysis of the Company's financial performance by investors and financial analysts.
