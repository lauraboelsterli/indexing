    "text": "SANTA ANA, Calif., April 23, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Ducommun Incorporated (NYSE:DCO) (“Ducommun” or the “Company”) today announced that it has completed the acquisition of Certified Thermoplastics Co., LLC (“CTP”), based in Santa Clarita, Calif. Founded in 1978, CTP is a leader in precision profile extrusions and extruded assemblies of engineered thermoplastic resins, compounds and alloys for a wide range of commercial aerospace, defense, medical, and industrial applications.\n“I am delighted to welcome the CTP team to Ducommun as we continue to add high value engineered products to the portfolio,” said Stephen Oswald, Ducommun president and chief executive officer. “As I‘ve stated in the past, our strategy is to diversify towards more customized, higher value, engineered products with greater aftermarket potential. CTP adds to the Company’s proprietary capabilities in aerostructures and expands our footprint into an entirely new market – aircraft interiors. I am also pleased that Robert Duncan, CTP’s current president and its primary shareholder, will be staying on to help with the transition of the business to Ducommun.”\n“I am very excited to join the Ducommun family. CTP’s focus on specialty extrusions – particularly for use in aviation interiors – will complement Ducommun’s existing portfolio of products across its end-use markets. I also believe that by joining Ducommun, CTP will be able to further accelerate the growth that we have experienced over the past few years,” added Robert Duncan, CTP’s president.\nDucommun expects the acquisition to be accretive to earnings within the first year following closing and financed the purchase through its existing revolving credit facility.\nAdvisors\nWinston & Strawn, LLP served as legal advisor to Ducommun. Houlihan Lokey served as financial advisor and Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, LLP served as legal advisor to CTP.\nAbout Ducommun Incorporated\nDucommun Incorporated delivers value-added innovative manufacturing solutions to customers in the aerospace, defense and industrial markets. Founded in 1849, the company specializes in two core areas – Electronic Systems and Structural Systems – to produce complex products and components for commercial aircraft platforms, mission-critical military and space programs, and sophisticated industrial applications.
