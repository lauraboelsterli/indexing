    "text": "SYDNEY, Australia, April 16, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NEP Group, the worldwide outsourced technical production partner supporting premier content producers of live sports and entertainment, announced today its acquisition of New Zealand’s NZ Live, an Auckland-based, independent playout, outside broadcast and studio provider. The acquisition provides NEP entry into the New Zealand broadcasting market and strengthens its position as an industry leader in broadcast services, live events and media solutions.\nNZ Live’s operation provides 24/7 multi-channel playout, outside broadcasting and studio production services to several clients throughout the region, operating four television studios and two outside broadcast mobile units. NZ Live will be rebranded as NEP and work closely with the company’s NEP Australia division.\n“We are excited to bring the wealth of knowledge of NZ Live’s leadership team and the company’s talented staff into the NEP Worldwide Network,” said Soames Treffry, President of NEP Australia. “This acquisition gives us ready access to the entire New Zealand broadcasting market and an opportunity to work directly with New Zealand’s broadcasters and national sporting organisations.

As part of NEP, we enhance our local know-how with immediate access to the latest international sports broadcasting trends and distribution models. That means we’ll provide clients with a much broader array of services from the world’s industry leader.\n“NEP has the vision, experience and resources to deliver world-class, live sports and programming to any New Zealand sporting organisation, broadcaster or rights holder,” he adds. “It’s a great business and good cultural fit for everyone.”\nTo learn more about NEP’s solutions and locations visit https://www.nepgroup.com/ .\n# # #\nAbout NEP\nFor over 30 years, NEP has been a worldwide outsourced technical production partner supporting premier content producers of live sports, entertainment, music and corporate events.
