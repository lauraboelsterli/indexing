    "text": "April 4, 2018 / 11:23 PM / Updated 2 hours ago Foxconn and Sirin Labs to make first blockchain smartphone Reuters Staff 2 Min Read \n(Reuters) - Swiss-Israeli technology firm Sirin Labs said that FIH Mobile Ltd ( 2038.HK ), a subsidiary of world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn, will manufacture its Finney blockchain smartphone, which is designed to securely store and use digital currencies such as bitcoin in fee-less transactions. The logo of Foxconn, the trading name of Hon Hai Precision Industry, is seen on top of the company's building in Taipei, Taiwan March 30, 2018. REUTERS/Tyrone Siu \nFinney, the world’s first blockchain-based smartphone, can automatically convert tokens for the use of decentralized applications, without having to obtain the different tokens through an exchange, Sirin said. \nThe company raised $157.8 million in an initial coin offering in December to support the development of an open source blockchain smartphone, as well as a blockchain personal computer. \nSirin plans to sell the device through eight new stores located in Vietnam and Turkey and has so far more than 25,000 units preordered, according to a Bloomberg report bloom.bg/2IqjAQD. \nSirin aims to ship from 100,000 to a few million units this year, the report said.
