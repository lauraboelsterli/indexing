    "text": "Chris Taylor, Corey Seager and Matt Kemp hit their first homers of the season, and Los Angeles left-hander Hyun-Jin Ryu gave up one hit in six scoreless innings as the Dodgers posted a 4-0 victory over the visiting Oakland A’s on Tuesday at Dodger Stadium.\nTaylor and Seager hit back-to-back homers to open the first inning, and Kemp’s solo shot bounced off the top of the right field fence in a two-run sixth inning for the Dodgers (4-6), who have won two in a row after a four-game losing streak.\nRyu (1-0) struck out eight and did not give up a hit until Stephen Piscotty hit a hard single to center field with two outs in the fifth inning. Ryu allowed only two baserunners and retired 13 in a row after walking Matt Chapman with one out in the first inning before Piscotty’s hit.\nKemp and Cody Bellinger each had two of the Dodgers’ 11 hits, and Logan Forsythe hit an RBI double in the sixth inning. Every Los Angeles starter including Ryu had a hit.\nKenley Jansen recorded his second save in as many games, getting the final two outs after Khris Davis and Matt Olson singled off Ross Stripling with one out in the ninth inning.\nThe A’s are 4-8, their slowest start since the 2001 team began 4-11. They got only two balls out of the infield against Ryu and finished with five hits. They had three hits and struck out 12 times in their previous game, a 6-1 loss to Los Angeles Angels right-hander Shohei Ohtani on Sunday.\nDavis had two singles, and Marcus Semien doubled in the eighth inning for Oakland’s only extra-base hit. Semien broke up Ohtani’s perfect game with a single in the seventh inning Sunday.\nTaylor homered on Sean Manaea’s fourth pitch of the game, and Seager homered three pitches later for a quick 2-0 lead.\nManaea (1-2) gave up only those two runs and seven hits in five innings. He struck out five and walked one. He has given up only four runs in his first three starts.\nThe Dodgers threw their third shutout. They have been shut out three times also while playing without third baseman Justin Turner.\nThe Dodgers were 16-4 in interleague play in 2017 while winning 101 games and their fifth straight NL West title. Taylor has reached safely in his past 10 interleague games, going 20-for-40 with eight extra-base hits and nine RBIs.\n—Field Level Media\n ",
